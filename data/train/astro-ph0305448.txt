    "the number of known extrasolar planetary systems are quickly growing ( butler et al .",
    "2003,paper i ) in recent years .",
    "the analysis and orbital fitting of the curves of radial velocity can reveal the fact that the main - sequence stars may host one or more planets .",
    "recently , fischer et al.(2003)(paper ii ) reported the properties of ten multiple - planet systems ( see table 8 in paper ii ) and pointed out that most of the systems with the ratio of orbital periods less than 5:1 are characterized by mean motion resonance ( mmr ) , such as gj 876(2:1 ) and hd 82943(2:1 ) .",
    "the other important feature for these systems is the apsidal lock of the orbiting companions , which indicates that the relative apsidal longitudes of two orbits librate about a constant , such that two planets have common time - averaged rate of apsidal precession .",
    "a number of researchers studied this dynamical mechanism in the planetary systems .",
    "the work of ji et al.(2003a ) confirmed that the inner two companions of 55 cnc ( marcy et al .",
    "2002 ) are in a 3:1 resonance and still experience the apsidal phase - locking .",
    "in fact , one may be familiar to the presence of the apsidal lock in our solar system , such as the galilean satellites of io - europa where the difference of their apsidal longitudes @xmath2 are anti - aligned ( lee & peale 2002 ) . in the case of the pulsar psr 1257 + 12 ,",
    "wolszczan & frail ( 1992 ) pointed out that there exists almost a @xmath2-libration about @xmath3 for the two planets in a 3:2 mmr .",
    "then a question arises : are all discovered multiple - planet systems in apsidal lock ?",
    "if so , how frequently does this mechanism take place for these systems ?    according to laplace - lagrange (",
    "l - l ) linear secular theory ( murray & dermott 1999 , md99 ) , if @xmath2 is a libration point , then @xmath4 could also be the other equilibrium due to the symmetry of planetary configurations ( also see beauge et al .",
    "so the second question is that if two planets undergo alignment or antialignment , could the mirror geometry occur ? in this letter , our goal is to examine the apsidal motion for hd 37124 , hd 12661 , hd 82943 , 47 uma , gj 876 .",
    "in the present work , we performed a preliminary study of various systems by using n - body codes(ji , li & liu 2002 ) .",
    "we take the masses of the parent star and companions(with sin__i _ _ = 1 ) from table 1 for each system .",
    "the time step is adopted to be 1% to 2.5% of the orbital period of the innermost planet . here",
    "we simply account for coplanar configurations for these systems .",
    "we remain the values of the semi - major axes unchanged for all orbits .",
    "the eccentricities and arguments of periapse are generated in the orbital parameters web based on the best - fit orbital solutions given the nominal observation errors ( see table 1 ) . and",
    "the remaining arguments of nodal longitudes and mean anomalies are randomly made between @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "finally , five two - planet systems were individually produced 100 pairs of coplanar orbits for integration from 1 myr to 10 myr .    throughout the paper ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the mean and periastron longitudes of a planet respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 separately represent the inner and outer companions . ] .",
    "consequently , the relative apsidal longitude is @xmath2 = @xmath10 .",
    "paper i revealed that two companions orbit hd 37124 , but indicated that with only 30 observations the eccentricity of the outer planet was poorly determined , with any eccentricity between 0.3 and 0.8 fitting the observations within measurement errors ( butler 2003 , private communication ) . in our simulations , we let @xmath11 initially be in the interval [ 0.20 , 0.60 ] in an attempt to find likely dynamical constraints for @xmath11 . however , all orbits can survive for @xmath12 yr , indicating the system is extremely stable for any initial @xmath11 no greater than 0.60 .",
    "moreover , we noticed that @xmath11 ranges from 0 to 0.62 in secular evolution for all cases , coinciding with the outcomes by paper i and kiseleva - eggleton et al.(2002 ) .",
    "they pointed out that the system self - destructed for the critical initial value of @xmath11 above 0.65 .",
    "in addition , there are two typical secular variations of both eccentricities for stable orbits:(a)case of large oscillations:@xmath13 is up to 0.85 and @xmath11 is less than 0.62.(b)case of small modulations , both @xmath13 and @xmath11 are less than 0.40 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the dynamical origin of high eccentricity for case ( a ) may result from kozai mechanism ( kozai 1962;wu & murray 2003 ) that implies the coupled relationship of the maximum eccentricity and minimum inclination .",
    "furthermore , it is noteworthy that 43% , but imply that two planets of this system likely tend to be aligned . ] and 1% of the stable orbits are separately in the periapse alignment and antialignment . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such results are a new finding for this system . in figure 1",
    ", the upper and low panels separately exhibit the variations of eccentricities and relative apsidal longitudes .",
    "the results of l - l theory ( dash lines ) confirm the numerical results ( thick lines ) in the amplitudes and periods of libration for both eccentricities and @xmath2 .",
    "the orbital fits revealed that the hd 12661 system is close to 11:2 mmr ( paper ii;gozdziewski 2003a ) or 6:1 mmr ( gozdziewski & maciejewski 2003b ) . with the best - fit data from paper ii ,",
    "our simulations exhibit all the orbits are stable for 1 myr .",
    "we observe that 46% and 49% of the orbits are in @xmath2-libration about @xmath1 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "moreover , gozdziewski(2003a ) indicated that the possibility of @xmath2-circulation is much less likely than @xmath2-libration about @xmath1 or @xmath14 in the numerical investigations . here",
    "the two types of the apsidal librations almost share an equal opportunity to be acted as one of the dynamical mechanisms to remain the stability of hd 12661 , because the two planets with moderate eccentricities are always far from each other with isolated orbits and protected from close encounters .",
    "still , the fact of @xmath2-libration indicates that one planet travels through the periapse or apoapse when the other moves to the opposite side at the same time .",
    "the critical arguments for 11:2 mmr @xmath15 can be written : @xmath16 here we define @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "most systems in a 11:2 mmr are only in behavior of @xmath20-libration .",
    "a particular case is exhibited in figure 2 , which not only ten resonant arguments all librate but @xmath21 librates about @xmath14 for 1 myr . using octupole - level secular theory",
    ", lee & peale ( 2003 ) found that if the ratio of the maximum orbital angular momenta is approximately equal to a critical value , then the @xmath2-libration about @xmath1 or @xmath14 could happen with large amplitude variations of the eccentricities .",
    "additionally , we further found that the status of @xmath2-libration are relevant to the ratio of the initial eccentricities and the initial relative apsidal longitudes of two planets ( see  3 ) .",
    "the two companions of 47 uma is a close analog to the duo of jupiter and saturn in our solar system in the ratios of the planet masses and orbital periods .",
    "laughlin et al.(2002 ) found the system is in @xmath2-libration about @xmath1 with low eccentricities of the companions .",
    "further , gozdziewski ( 2002 ) used megno technique to investigate in wide ranges of the orbital parameters for the system . using the updated parameters by paper",
    "ii , we still found this system can experience not only a @xmath2-libration about @xmath1 , but about @xmath14 .",
    "we note that all the experiments can last for 10 myr .",
    "the fractions in alignment , antialignment and circulation are respectively 20% , 10% and 70% .",
    "as well known , jupiter and saturn are near 5:2 mmr , but the @xmath2 circulates at present - day . as for 47 uma , we did find one of the critical arguments @xmath22 temporarily librates for hundreds of years but @xmath2 simultaneously circulates in the secular evolution .",
    "however , we argue that 47 uma may be captured into 8:3 mmr in the past during the process of migration due to the planet - disk interaction .",
    "the celebrated nature for hd 82943 and gj 876 is that the ratio of the orbital periods of two companions is respectively close to 2:1 .",
    "the critical arguments for 2:1 resonance are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the relative apsidal longitude is @xmath25 . in the simulations , we found three types of stable orbits for hd 82943:(i)only @xmath20 librates about @xmath1 ( ii)case of alignment , @xmath26 ( iii)case of antialignment , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we noticed that 2% , 3% and 2% of the cases belong to classes i , ii and iii respectively .",
    "the geometry of class i was also discovered by gozdziewski & maciejewski ( 2001 ) .",
    "but classes ii and iii are quite a new discovery that exhibits the hd 82943 system can undertake apsidal lock ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "recently , lee m. h.(2003 , private communication ) pointed out that the best - fit solution makes the orbits closer to be aligned than anti - aligned in the study of the 2:1 resonance .",
    "we used a semi - analytical ( ji et al .",
    "2003b ) model to investigate the apsidal motion for this system and found that although the two planets have high eccentricities up to 0.54 and 0.41 , the system remain stable for 10 myr because of both dynamical mechanisms of the 2:1 mmr and apsidal lock .",
    "several best - fit orbital solutions for gj 876 appeared in literature ( marcy et al .",
    "2001 ; laughlin & chambers 2001;rivera & lissauer 2001 ) .",
    "here we presented numerical results based on laughlin - chambers fit .",
    "two families of orbits are found to be stable : classes i ( 14% ) and ii ( 7% ) . in summary , for above two systems , we stress that the 2:1 mmr always takes place for stable cases and the apsidal alignment(laughlin & chambers 2001;lee & peale 2002 ) seems to have more likely chances .    on the other hand , as the two orbits of gj 876 ( or hd 82943 ) are not well separated , repeated interplanetary close approaches may lead to disruption of the systems:79% for gj 876 rapidly become unstable , and 93% for hd 82943 .",
    "butler et al.(1999 ) reported the first triple - planet system of @xmath0 and , consisting of a 51 peg - like planet with a 4.6-day orbit and two librating outer planets ( rivera & lissauer 2000;chiang , tabachnik & tremaine 2001;chiang & murray 2002 ) .",
    "with the updated data(paper ii ) , we again examined several tests for integration of @xmath12 yr and discovered that two outer components can still remain in the apsidal lock about @xmath1 .",
    "as for 55 cnc , we revealed that the inner two companions perform the asymmetric @xmath2-libration about @xmath30 or @xmath31 in the secular evolution ( ji et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "nagasawa et al.(2003 ) showed that the two planets of hd 168443 and hd 74156 are both in circulation .",
    "moreover , we performed additional experiments for hd 38529 , but simply found the planets circulate .",
    "the systems of hd 168443 , hd 74156 and hd 38529 are similar ( table 2 ) , because each of them has a more massive outer planet and a close inner companion .",
    "the reason for circulation will be explained in  3 .",
    "nevertheless , if one of three systems can host an extra middle planet with new observations , there may exist librating planets similar to those of 55 cnc and @xmath0 and .",
    "however , one should make clear the conditions for libration or circulation of @xmath2 for two planets . several theoretical works ( malhotra 2002;lee & peale 2003;nagasawa et al .",
    "2003;zhou & sun 2003)were concentrated on the problem .",
    "beauge et al.(2003 ) presented analytical and numerical outcomes on the existence and location of stable equilibrium solutions about the systems in mean motion resonance . here",
    "we present our results based on l - l theory .",
    "following md99 , we have : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are initially determined constants ( see md99 ) and @xmath13 , @xmath11 are the eccentricities of each planet . here",
    "we rewrite the coefficients in equation ( 4 ) , such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . for hierarchical planetary systems",
    "( hd 168443 , hd 74156 and hd 38529 , the ratio of the semi - major axes @xmath41 ) , we have @xmath42(see table 2 ) , thus the part of @xmath43 is dominant and @xmath2 circulates(see also nagasawa et al.2003 ) . according to ( 4 ) , the critical values of @xmath44 for @xmath2-libration : @xmath45 where the plus sign in @xmath46 corresponds to the case for @xmath2-libration about @xmath1 , and the minus sign to that of @xmath2-libration about @xmath14 , with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 are laplace coefficients , @xmath49 ) and @xmath50@xmath51 ( @xmath52 are respectively the ratio of the masses of companion b ( c ) and host star ) . hence , there are two requirements for apsidal libration of a pair of planets in the absence of mean motion commensurabilities .",
    "firstly , the ratio of initial eccentricities of two planets should not be far from the critical values;secondly , the starting relative apsidal longitude should be satisfied to approach @xmath1 or @xmath14 . as a paradigm of hd 37124 ( see figure 1 ) , the initial ratio of the eccentricities @xmath53 is close to @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , thus the two planets are aligned .",
    "we can apply the criteria to other systems .",
    "in this work , we investigated the apsidal motion for the multi - planet systems : we find that the two planets of hd 37124 , hd 12661 , 47 uma and hd 82943 separately undergo the apsidal alignment or antialignment .",
    "but the companions of gj 876 and @xmath0 and are only in apsidal lock about @xmath1 , which means that no mirror configurations occur for them .",
    "moreover , we again used the l - l theory to discern whether two planets of a system librate or not .",
    "the status of @xmath2-libration depends on the ratio of their initial eccentricities , semi - major axes and planetary masses and original relative apsidal longitudes . and",
    "it seems to be a selection effect for the companions in the multi - planet systems that are involved in the apsidal libration .",
    "however , this should be further testified by additional observations of the planetary systems .",
