    "the number of photons in the spectrum is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the charge of the particle , and the equivalent two - photon luminosity is thus proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "the strong dependence on @xmath15 favours the use of heavy ions for studying two - photon and photonuclear processes .",
    "the virtualities of the equivalent photons when the field couples coherently to the entire nucleus are restricted by the nuclear form factor to @xmath17 . here ,",

    "the strong fields associated with heavy ions at high energies lead to large probabilities for exchanging additional soft photons in the same event . most of these photons have too low energy to produce particles , but they can excite the interacting nuclei . the dominating excitation is to a giant - dipole resonance ( gdr ) with energies @xmath33  mev@xmath34 , which decays by emitting neutrons at very forward rapidities , providing a very useful means to trigger on upcs with zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) .",

    "an additional `` coherent '' identification cut was applied by selecting only those @xmath1 candidates detected in opposite arms .",
