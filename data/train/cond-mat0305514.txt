    "in this paper we study the classical ( i.e.  non - quantum ) equilibrium statistical mechanic properties of confined coulomb systems with adsorbing boundaries .",
    "a coulomb system is a system of charged particles interacting through the coulomb potential .",
    "there are several interesting realizations of coulomb systems with several applications such as plasmas , electrolytes , colloidal suspensions , etc ... in the present paper we are interested in the case where the coulomb system is confined with boundaries that can attract and adsorb some particles of the system .",
    "our study of this kind of systems will be done using a solvable model of coulomb system : the symmetric two - dimensional two - component plasma , a system of two kind of oppositely charged particles @xmath0 at thermal equilibrium at an inverse temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the classical equilibrium statistical mechanics of the system can be exactly solved when @xmath2 .",
    "one can think of several examples where the present situation of coulomb systems confined with adsorbing boundaries is relevant , for instance in a plasma or an electrolyte near an electrode with adsorbing sites  @xcite .",
    "another situation in which we will focus our attention is in solutions of amphiphathic molecules and ions for example in soap films and bubbles .",
    "amphiphathic molecules have an hydrophobic tail and an hydrophilic charged head ( usually negative ) and , for this reason , when they are submerged in water they rearrange themselves in such a way as to minimize the contact of the hydrophobic tails with the surrounding medium .",
    "they can achieve configurations such as bilayers , micelles and vesicles , among others .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied a soap film by modeling it as a coulomb system confined in a slab .",
    "a soap film can be seen as a system of amphiphathic molecules in a bilayer configuration with a water inner layer .",
    "the overall neutral system with negatively charged amphiphathic anions and positive micro - cations ( usually na@xmath3 ) in water was modeled as a two - dimensional two - component plasma .",
    "the two dimensions were in the breadth of the film not on the surface : we studied a cross section of the film .",
    "because of the hydrophobicity of their tails , the soap anions prefer to be in the boundaries of the film .",
    "this was modeled by a one - body attractive short - range external potential acting over them .",
    "this means that the negative particles felt an attractive potential over a small distance near each boundary . in this sense the negative particles of the system can be `` adsorbed '' by the boundary .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we found exact expressions for the density , correlations and pressure inside the film . by studying the disjoining pressure , we were able to conclude that the coulomb interaction plays an important role in the collapse of a thick soap film to a much thinner film .",
    "actually if a large number of amphiphathic molecules are in the boundary due to a large strength of the attractive external potential near the boundary , the system is always stable . on the other hand if the attractive potential near the boundary is not strong enough a thick film will not be stable and will collapse to a thin film .    these results can be compared ( qualitatively due to the simplicity of the model under consideration ) to the experimental situation of the transition of a thick film to a thin black film .",
    "these black film phenomena occur when the soap films width is smaller than visible light wavelength and it is seen black",
    ". two types of black films are observed experimentally : the common black film and the much thinner newton black film .",
    "it is interesting to know to what extent the results of our previous work  @xcite depend on the geometry .",
    "here we study this two - component plasma system confined in two other geometries , a disk and an annulus . as we mentioned before , amphiphathic molecules in water can achieve micelles and vesicles among others configurations . in two dimensions ,",
    "a cylindrical micelle can be seen as a disk and a cylindrical vesicle as an annulus . if the length of the cylindrical micelle or vesicle if much larger that its radius it is reasonable to assume that the system in invariant in the longitudinal direction and so we study only a cross section of the system : a disk or an annulus .",
    "the coulomb interaction is then the two - dimensional coulomb potential which is @xmath4 for two particles at a distance @xmath5 of each other .",
    "the length @xmath6 is an arbitrary length which fixes the zero of the potential .",
    "two - dimensional coulomb systems with log interaction have properties that are similar to those in three dimensional charged systems with the usual @xmath7 potential .",
    "they satisfy gauss law and poisson equation in two dimensions .",
    "several universal properties , such as screening effects , are direct consequences of the harmonic nature of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 potentials , which are the solutions of the two- and three - dimensional poisson equation .",
    "therefore the exact solutions obtained for the 2d models play an important role in understanding real 3d coulomb systems .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present in detail the system under consideration and briefly review how this model can be exactly solved . in section  [ sec : pressure ]",
    "we compute the grand potential of the system and the disjoining pressure and study the stability of the system . in section",
    "[ sec : density ] we compute the density profiles of the different types of particles in the system and the adsorbed charge on the boundaries .",
    "finally , we conclude recalling the main results of the present work .",
    "the system under consideration is a two - dimensional system composed of two types of point particles with charges @xmath0 .",
    "two particles with charges @xmath9 and @xmath10 at a distance @xmath5 apart interact with the two - dimensional coulomb potential @xmath11 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary length .",
    "this system is known as the symmetric two - dimensional two - component plasma .",
    "when the boltzmann factor for the coulomb potential is written , the adimensional coulombic coupling constant appears : @xmath12 .",
    "notice that in two dimensions @xmath13 has dimensions of energy . for a system of point particles",
    "if @xmath14 the system is unstable against the collapse of particles of opposite sign , the thermodynamics of the system are not well defined unless one considers hard - core particles or another regularization procedure ( for instance a lattice model instead of a continuous gas ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath15 the thermal agitation is enough to avoid the collapse and the system of point particles is well defined .",
    "the two - component plasma is known to be equivalent to the sine - gordon model and using this relationship and the results known for this integrable field theory , the thermodynamic properties of the two - component plasma in the bulk have been exactly determined  @xcite in the whole range of stability @xmath15 . however , there are no exact results for confined systems for arbitrary @xmath16 ( with the exception of a coulomb system near an infinite plane conductor  @xcite or ideal dielectric  @xcite wall ) .",
    "it is also well - known for some time that when @xmath17 the sine - gordon field theory is at its free fermion point .",
    "this means that the system is equivalent to a free fermion field theory and therefore much more information on the system can be obtained .",
    "in particular the thermodynamic properties and correlation functions can be exactly computed even for confined systems in several different geometries and different boundary conditions  @xcite . from now on we will consider only the case when @xmath17 .    since at @xmath17 a system of point particles is not stable one should start with a regularized model with a cutoff distance @xmath18 which can be the diameter of the hard - core particles or the lattice spacing in a lattice model  @xcite .",
    "the system is worked out in the grand - canonical ensemble at given chemical potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the positive and negative particles respectively . in the limit of a continuous model @xmath21 the grand partition function and the bulk densities diverge .",
    "however the correlation functions have a well - defined limit . in this continuous limit",
    "it is useful to work with the rescaled fugacities  @xcite @xmath22 that have inverse length dimensions .",
    "the length @xmath23 can be shown to be the screening length of the system  @xcite .",
    "if external potentials @xmath24 act on the particles ( as in our case ) it is useful to define position dependent fugacities @xmath25 .",
    "let us briefly review the method of resolution described by cornu and jancovici @xcite for the two - component plasma .",
    "it will be useful to use the complex coordinates @xmath26 for the position of the particles . for a continuous model , @xmath21 , ignoring the possible divergences for the time being ,",
    "it is shown in ref .",

    ", the density can be expressed as a functional derivative @xmath36 if we define the @xmath37 matrix @xmath38 as the kernel of the inverse of the operator @xmath39 then the one - body density and two - body ursell functions can be expressed in terms of these green functions as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denote the sign of the particles . in polar",
    "coordinates these green functions satisfy the following set of equations @xmath42\\\\",

    "the above formalism is very general , it can be applied to a variety of situations . in the case",
    "we are interested in , we will consider two geometries in which the system is confined : a disk of radius @xmath45 and an annulus of inner and outer radius @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the negative particles are supposed to model amphiphathic molecules and therefore they are attracted to the boundaries of the system while positive particles are not .",
    "this is modeled by an attractive external one - body potential @xmath48 acting on the negative particles near the boundary while for the positive particles @xmath49 .",
    "actually we will consider two models for this potential . in the first model ( model i ) the fugacity @xmath50 for the negative particles reads , for the disk geometry , @xmath51 inside the disk , while @xmath52 is constant . outside the disk @xmath53 both fugacities vanish . in the annulus geometry , @xmath54 inside the annulus .",
    "the coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 measure the strength of the attraction to the walls . in the following",
    "we will call these coefficients adhesivities .    in the second model ( model ii ) that we will eventually consider the external potential @xmath48 is a step function with a range @xmath58 of attraction near the boundary .",
    "this model allows us to obtain valuable information regarding the frontier regions .",
    "actually we will report here only the main results for the annulus geometry with model ii in section  [ sec : modelii ] , further results on this model on the disk geometry can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the two following sections we will apply the method presented here to obtain the grand potential and the density profiles of the system .",
    "to find the pressure of the confined coulomb system we proceed first to compute the grand potential .",
    "as shown in section  [ sec : model ] the grand potential @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath35 are the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath28 given by equation  ( [ eq : def - k ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for @xmath28 with eigenvalue @xmath61 and eigenvector @xmath62 reads    [ eq : vp - k ] @xmath63    these two equations can be combined into @xmath64 we now detail the computation of the grand potential for the case of a coulomb system confined in a disk .",
    "the annulus geometry follows similar calculations .",
    "we will only use model i for the attracting potential on the boundary for the calculation of the grand potential . using model",
    "i the fugacities inside the disk read @xmath65 and outside the disk they vanish . replacing these fugacities into the eigenvalue problem equations  ( [ eq : vp - k ] )",
    "we find that @xmath66 is a continuous function while @xmath67 is discontinuous at @xmath68 due to the dirac delta distribution in @xmath50 .",
    "the discontinuity of @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 defining @xmath71 , inside the disk @xmath72 , @xmath66 obeys the equation @xmath73 with solutions of the form @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a modified bessel function of order @xmath77 . outside the disk @xmath78 and the corresponding solutions to equations  ( [ eq : vp - k ] ) are that @xmath69 is analytic and @xmath79 anti - analytic , namely , @xmath80 in order to have vanishing solutions at @xmath81 it is necessary that    @xmath82    using these boundary conditions together with the continuity of @xmath79 at @xmath45 and the discontinuity  ( [ eq : discont - psi ] ) of @xmath69 at @xmath45 gives the eigenvalue equation    [ eq : eigenval - eq ] @xmath83    the product appearing in equation  ( [ eq : omega - prod - lambda ] ) can be partially computed by recognizing that the l.h.s of the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : eigenval - eq ] ) for arbitrary @xmath61 can be written as a weierstrass product  @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the analytic functions @xmath84   ( l-1 ) !",

    "since @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 is an even function it can be factorized as the weierstrass product @xmath92 where the product runs over all @xmath93 solutions of equation  ( [ eq : eigenval - eq ] ) for a given @xmath77 .",
    "then we can conclude that the grand potential  ( [ eq : omega - prod - lambda ] ) is given by @xmath94 after shifting by one the index in the second sum and rearranging the expression we find the final result for the grand potential @xmath95 with @xmath96\\ ] ] which is the grand potential for a two - component plasma in a disk with hard wall boundaries  @xcite ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98\\ ] ] is the contribution due to the attractive potential near the walls .",
    "now we turn our attention to the case of the coulomb system confined in an annulus of inner radius @xmath46 and outer radius @xmath47 . in this case the position - dependent fugacity for the negative particles inside the annulus is given by @xmath99 the calculation of the grand potential follows similar steps as above .",

    "this is due to the fact that the two - component plasma of point particles is not stable against the collapse of particles of opposite sign for @xmath105 and a short - distance cutoff @xmath18 should be introduced , @xmath18 can be interpreted as the hard - core diameter of the particles .",
    "if @xmath45 is the characteristic size of the system ( for instance the radius of the disk in the disk case ) then @xmath106 is a wave - length and the short - distance cutoff @xmath18 gives an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath107 .",
    "then the cutoff for @xmath77 ( say @xmath108 ) in the sums should be chosen of order @xmath109  @xcite .",

    "@xmath110 has a large-@xmath110 expansion @xmath111 similar to the one predicted by cardy  @xcite for critical systems .",

    "there is a negative charge density layer and outside the border , in the bulk region 2 , a positive layer , the same one that was previously observed with model i in figure  [ fig : rhoannulus ] .",
    "these double layers are concentrated near the interfaces at @xmath345 and at @xmath346 and have a thickness of order @xmath23 for the positive layer in region 2 and @xmath373 for the negative layer in regions 1 and 3 .",
    "the present solvable model studied here gave us interesting information about the behavior of confined coulomb systems with attractive boundaries .",
    "this system has an induced internal charge on the boundary which is created by an external potential which is not of electrical nature .",
    "this potential only acts on the negative particles , while the positive particles are unaffected .",
    "this is not the usual situation that has been studied extensively in the past , where the system is submitted to electrical forces due to possible external charges .",
    "first , we found that large systems exhibit the same finite - size corrections that for systems without attractive boundaries , confirming again the universal nature of these finite - size corrections . studying the disjoining pressure we found that the attractive boundaries have a stabilizing effect .",
    "this was noticed also in our previous work  @xcite , however the curvature in the present case is very important .",
    "it makes the surface tension to be the predominant contribution to the disjoining pressure , as opposed to the slab geometry .",
    "then , we conclude that the curvature has also a stabilizing effect on the system in comparison to the slab geometry in which the system can be unstable for low values of the adhesivity .",
    "the study of the density profiles gives information about the structure of the system .",
    "as expected , there are some adsorbed charges on the boundary and these are screened by a positive layer of charge inside the system .",
    "we were able to check explicitly an electro - neutrality sum rule and a few relations that the adsorbed charge in the boundary satisfy .",
    "it would be interesting to know what features of the present model are universal and which are not .",
    "a step toward answering this question can be obtained by studying another solvable model of coulomb system , the one - component plasma .",
    "a preliminary study of this system was done in ref .",
    "@xcite and this will be the subject of a future paper",
