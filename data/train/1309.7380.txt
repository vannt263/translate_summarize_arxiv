    "one of the main open questions in black hole physics concerns the microscopic explanation ( if any ) of the black hole entropy law : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the event horizon area and @xmath3 is the planck length , which equals the square root of the newtonian constant @xmath4 in @xmath5 units ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review and further references ) .",
    "in contrast to usual thermodynamical systems , the black hole entropy @xmath6 scales with the square rather than with the cube of its linear dimension . among the various proposals to explain it , the possibility that the black hole entropy has its roots in the entanglement of the background fields  @xcite is perhaps the most conservative one , since it relies on the same fields which give rise to hawking radiation .",
    "( nevertheless some points must still be clarified ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review . ) this line of thought was raised after bombelli et al .",
    "@xcite and srednicki  @xcite independently concluded that the entanglement entropy @xmath0 of a vacuum scalar field across a spherical boundary in minkowski space - time scales with its area @xmath7 rather than with its volume  @xcite .",
    "srednicki also showed that the result is independent of any infrared cut off , and obtained an explicit result assuming a massless scalar field : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a length quantity derived from the theory s ultraviolet cut off .",
    "some properties of this law can be derived from physical arguments .",
    "for one , the schmidt decomposition guarantees that the entropy is the same , regardless of whether we trace over the degrees of freedom either inside or outside the sphere , provided that the total state is pure .",
    "thus @xmath0 can only depend on the area @xmath7 of the boundary shared by the two regions , but not , for example , on the radius of the sphere ( which characterizes only the interior ) or the infrared cutoff ( exterior ) .",
    "assuming that the scalar field is massless , the only other quantity on which the entropy may depend is @xmath9 . by demanding that @xmath0 be dimensionless , we constrain the entropy to be a function of the form @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that , among all possibilities , eq .",
    "( [ eq : s srednicki ] ) turns out to be a linear function of @xmath11 is quite remarkable .",
    "here we investigate whether the same area law  ( [ eq : s srednicki ] ) continues to hold if we introduce a curved background , which is characterized by an additional parameter @xmath12 , the radius of curvature",
    ". then the most general entropy dependence can be cast as @xmath13.\\label{s_general_einstein}\\ ] ]    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : generalframework ] , we specify the problem and outline how the entanglement entropy is obtained .",
    "[ sec : flat ] presents tests of the scheme on regions with arbitrary geometry in flat ( minkowski ) space - time . in sec .",
    "[ sec : einstein ] we turn to the entanglement entropy of a sphere in the einstein universe , and sec .",
    "[ sec : finalremaks ] concludes .",
    "consider , for the sake of simplicity , a ground - state real scalar field @xmath14 , which lives in a minkowski space - time .",
    "we compute the entanglement entropy @xmath0 of a region @xmath15 , which arises when one traces out the degrees of freedom inside the region and computes the von neumann entropy of the reduced state .    in order to perform this computation numerically",
    ", we only consider a finite number of degrees of freedom , given by the values of the field at the sites of a finite discrete grid .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the spacing of the points , which can be interpreted as an ultraviolet cutoff : field modes with wavelengths below this limit are not described by the model .",
    "the infrared cutoff , on the other hand , is determined by the total number of points along each axis , denoted @xmath16 , @xmath17 etc .",
    "geometrically , the simplest discretization scheme is based on a cubic grid .",
    "this puts the hamiltonian in the form @xmath18,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the conjugate momentum .",
    "following srednicki @xcite , we identify this as the hamiltonian of an array of @xmath20 coupled harmonic oscillators : if we replace the indices @xmath21 by a single @xmath22 , @xmath23\\ ] ] for some coupling matrix @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the matrix that makes @xmath26 diagonal , and @xmath27 . treating the list of values @xmath28 as a vector allows us to write the ground - state density operator of such a system simply in terms of matrix products , @xmath29 since the numbering of the sites by the index @xmath30 is arbitrary , we can choose an ordering such that the partial trace is taken over the degrees of freedom @xmath31 .",
    "the reduced density matrix over the remaining @xmath32 oscillators , @xmath33 , is @xmath34\\rho_{0}\\left(\\tilde{\\varphi},\\check{\\varphi};\\tilde{\\varphi}^{\\prime},\\check{\\varphi}\\right).\\label{eq : integral for rhored}\\ ] ] given the form of @xmath35 in ( [ eq : groud state ] ) , this is an n - dimensional gaussian integral .",
    "we decompose    @xmath36    and define the @xmath37 matrices @xmath38 in terms of them , the integration in ( [ eq : integral for rhored ] ) gives @xmath39+\\tilde{\\varphi}^{t}\\beta\\tilde{\\varphi}^{\\prime}\\right).\\ ] ] it can be further simplified with the following substitutions : let @xmath40 be the matrix that makes @xmath41 diagonal and define @xmath42 then let @xmath43 be the eigenvalues of @xmath44 , let @xmath45 be the matrix that makes @xmath46 diagonal and define the new vector of variables @xmath47 in terms of them , @xmath48 takes the form @xmath49}.\\ ] ] each term in this product is simply a thermal density matrix for a simple harmonic oscillator @xmath50 , whose frequency @xmath51 and temperature @xmath52 are related to @xmath43 by @xmath53 thus it has entropy @xmath54 the total entropy of the reduced state , that is , the entanglement entropy , is simply the sum of these terms .",
    "the cubic discretization scheme allows us to choose for each site independently whether the value of the field at that point is to be traced out or not , thus giving us the freedom to study the entanglement entropy of regions with arbitrary shape .",
    "this reveals an area law , @xmath55 not only for cubes and parallelepipeds , but also hollow shells ( in which case both the inner and outer surfaces contribute ) and in fact arbitrary configurations .",
    "one can , for example , choose a set of unit cubes such that they approximate a sphere , and still ( [ eq : kappa cubic ] ) holds , with the same coefficient .",
    "this extends to more convoluted shapes , even when one portion of the surface comes to within one lattice site of another .",
    "the fact that there are no long - range effects  and consequently no influence of the global geometry of @xmath15 on @xmath0  , but only the linear scaling with the area , is a useful stepping stone towards our main question : how the geometry of the background space - time might affect @xmath0 .    before we proceed to the einstein universe , it is also useful to introduce and test a second discretization scheme . in a spherically symmetric setting , it is convenient to decompose @xmath14 in partial waves , @xmath56 .",
    "their angular dependence is given by the real spherical harmonics @xmath57 , so that they are functions only of the radial coordinate .",
    "given the symmetry of the system , the partial waves are not coupled to each other , and their contributions to entanglement entropy can be computed separately : for each @xmath58 , the radial coordinate is discretized , and the problem again reduces to an array of coupled harmonic oscillators . by the same procedure outlined above",
    ", we find the contributions @xmath59 , which are summed to obtain the total entanglement entropy @xmath0 . in practice",
    ", the convergence of the sum over @xmath60 allows us to extrapolate the exact value of @xmath0 after computing only a finite number of terms .",
    "this computation again leads to an area law : @xmath61 at first glance , this seems incompatible with result  ( [ eq : kappa cubic ] ) by a factor of @xmath62 . however , consider a comparison of the entropy each method yields for a given @xmath15 , namely a sphere of radius @xmath63 : using the spherical discretization scheme , we find simply @xmath64 .",
    "when this @xmath15 is decomposed into unit cubes , however , the surface of the actual region is not smooth , and can be shown to have an area of @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the entropy becomes @xmath66 , which agrees reasonably well with the previous result .",
    "besides the geometry of the traced - out region @xmath15 , we also explore how the entropy depends on the total space in which the field lives , @xmath67 ( the discrete array , in our model ) .",
    "we argue in the introduction that @xmath0 can not depend on geometric properties of the exterior , such as the infrared cutoff or the shape of @xmath67 .",
    "however , if @xmath67 were to become smaller than @xmath15 , so that all degrees of freedom of the field are traced out , then clearly the entropy must go to zero .",
    "our simulation allows us to explore this transition , revealing that the entropy remains constant until @xmath67 comes to within @xmath68 of @xmath15 , in spherical symmetry , and as little as a single lattice site in the cubic array .",
    "again , there is no evidence of long - range effects in the generation of entanglement entropy .",
    "now let us replace the minkowski space - time by an einstein universe , which has the spatial geometry of a 3-sphere .",
    "the corresponding line element can be cast as @xmath69 with @xmath70 , @xmath71 . because the einstein universe is compact",
    ", the curvature radius @xmath12 also defines a natural infrared cutoff scale , @xmath72 . at fixed time @xmath73 ,",
    "the surface of constant @xmath74 is the boundary of a spherical region @xmath15 , whose radius is @xmath75 .",
    "its surface area is @xmath76 , which is upper bounded by @xmath77 ( at @xmath78 ) . when @xmath79 , the local geometry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) approaches that of minkowski space - time .",
    "the discretization scheme for spherical symmetry outlined above ( see section  [ sec : flat ] ) carries over naturally to this case : the radial direction is divided into @xmath80 discrete points with spacing @xmath9 , indexed by @xmath30 . for each partial wave @xmath58 , this leads to a coupling matrix @xmath81 , from which one can calculate the contributions @xmath59 , and consequently @xmath0 .    for spheres that are small compared to the curvature radius , we recover the flat space area law ( [ eq : s sphere flat ] ) to good precision ( considering the limitations of numerical simulations ) : @xmath82 in fact , it can be shown analytically that , in the low - curvature limit , the coupling matrix reduces to its flat - space counterpart .",
    "we also note that @xmath0 is the same for @xmath83 and @xmath84  as expected , since both generate boundaries with the same area .",
    "the question , then , is how @xmath0 varies as a function of @xmath7 if the sphere is large enough that effects of curvature become noticeable , i.e. , in the limit @xmath85 , or @xmath86    fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] gives a clear answer : the area law ( [ eq : s curv ] ) holds regardless of the large - scale curvature of the background .     as a function of surface area @xmath7 ( in units of @xmath87 ) for spheres in an einstein universe ( @xmath88 )",
    "generally , curvature effects become non - negligible as @xmath7 approaches its upper bound , but the area law for the entropy is unaffected .",
    "( the lower bound @xmath89 is imposed by the semi - classical approximation ; for small areas , the quantum nature of the boundary itself become relevant.),width=340 ]",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath0 of a massless scalar field across a spherical surface in an einstein universe does not depend on the radius of the universe , @xmath12 . in the flat - space limit - a minkowski universe , simulated out to a finite radius @xmath63 -",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath0 does not depend on the infrared cutoff , because @xmath63 characterizes only the region outside the sphere , whereas the entropy can only depend on shared properties of the interior and the exterior . in curved space , on the other hand , the curvature radius @xmath12 is a meaningful physical parameter of the entire space , and therefore it is non - trivial that it does not affect @xmath0 .",
    "we understand this independence as an extension of a trend observed in flat - space studies of the entropy : entanglement entropy is dominated by short - range interactions , and therefore `` blind '' to large - scale features , including curved background .",
    "the relevant scale is given by the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory , @xmath9 . in our model , it is introduced ad hoc , by discretizing the field , but how it arises from natural laws is a topic of active research .",
    "the cutoff is expected to be of the order of the planck length , both for dimensional reasons and to ensure that the area law for entanglement entropy is compatible with other expressions for the entropy of black holes .",
    "if the curvature of space - time becomes noticeable on that scale , which characterizes the regime of quantum gravity , the area law is expected to break down .",
    "corrections to the area law also arise if one considers flat space , but non - zero spin or excited states @xcite , suggesting that the entropy is no longer determined solely by short - range interactions",
    ". it would be interesting to determine how the entropy responds to background curvature in these cases .",
