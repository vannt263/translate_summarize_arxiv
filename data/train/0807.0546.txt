    "the susceptibility is isotropic above the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition temperature @xmath8  k. at high temperatures the susceptibility follows a curie - weiss law , but deviates already at about 100 k and develops a broad maximum around 50 k indicative for short - range afm correlations . at @xmath4",

    "the evolution of the resonance - absorption spectrum with temperature is shown in figure [ fig:38ghz ] . at high temperatures ( in the paramagnetic phase ) a single absorption component with a @xmath13-factor close to 2.0 is observed .",
    "the transition to the antiferromagnetically ordered state is clearly marked by the discontinuous transformation of the resonance absorption spectrum : below the nel temperature @xmath4 the absorption spectrum consists of several components strongly shifted from the paramagnetic resonance position .",
    "no hysteresis exceeding the resolution limit of 0.1  k was detected at the transition .",
    "on cooling below @xmath4 the resonance lines first show a pronounced shift , but below 5  k the temperature dependence of the resonance positions is negligible .",
    "the shape of the resonance absorption spectra is strongly affected by field cooling .",
    "figure [ fig : fczfcall ] compares the resonance absorption measured on zfc and fc samples .",
    "here field cooling was performed at the field of 50  koe starting from 20  k. for @xmath12 and @xmath14 field cooling leads to the disappearance of some of the absorption components .",
    "the remaining absorption components are usually slightly shifted from the corresponding absorption component measured on the zfc sample .",
    "the vanishing absorption intensity does not necessarily add to the remaining components : for example , for @xmath12 the intensity of the remaining component after field cooling is the same as for the zfc sample .",
    "for @xmath11 field cooling effects are less evident  all absorption components are observed in fc samples , field cooling leads only to a slight change of the absorption intensity .",
    "actually , application of a field of 50  koe during the cooling seems to be excessive .",
    "it is enough to cool the sample at the moderate field of 18  koe to suppress some of the resonance modes as can be seen in the inset of figure [ fig : fczfcall ] . especially , the soft modes indicative for spin - reorientation , disappear after field cooling but reappear as the sample is rotated to another crystallographically equivalent position .",
    "note that the nonlinearity of the magnetization curves vanishes after field cooling as well .",
    "the stability of the zfc resonance absorption under prolonged exposure to the magnetic field below @xmath4 was also checked by the high - sensitive x - band measurements . at 4",
    "k the shape of the resonance absorption is reproducible to the finest details .",
    "however , at 8  k ( which is still below @xmath4 ) keeping the @xmath12-oriented sample at 18  koe for 90 minutes leads to 30% reduction of the observed resonance absorption .",
    "the entire frequency - field diagrams for the different orientations of the magnetic field are given in figure [ fig : fit3 ] .",
    "these dependences demonstrate the presence of several resonance modes with zero - field gaps of @xmath15  ghz and @xmath16  ghz . for @xmath12 and @xmath14 one of the resonance modes",
    "softens in the magnetic field between 10 and 15  koe .",
    "note that the nonlinearity of the magnetization curves is also observed at @xmath17  koe for these directions ( figure [ fig : m(h ) ] ) .",
    "field cooling reduces the number of the observed resonance modes to two : one for each of the zero - field gaps .",
    "as documented above , the change of the resonance field at the phase transition is discontinuous . in conventional molecular field approximation ,",
    "the shift of the antiferromagnetic resonance field with respect to the paramagnetic resonance is proportional to the magnitude of the order parameter , i.e. , to the sublattice magnetization .",
    "the discontinuous change of the resonance field at the phase transition indicates that the order parameter is not small even just below the transition temperature .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the first - order nature of the phase transition in zncr@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite    the magnetic susceptibility of the paramagnetic phase is isotropic due to its cubic symmetry .",
    "cubic symmetry is lost in the ordered state because of the lattice deformation .",
    "the lattice - strain direction can take one of the equivalent crystallographic axes .",
    "the susceptibility tensor of the antiferromagnet is anisotropic , the orientation of its principal axes is determined by the orientation of the order parameter fixed by anisotropic interactions with respect to the crystallographic axes .",
    "therefore , the susceptibility tensors of different structural domains are oriented differently and the gain in the zeeman energy is different for different domains .",
    "thus , the application of magnetic field makes one of the domains more favorable .",
    "it provides an obvious mechanism for the observed field - cooling effect and for the instability of the resonance absorption close to @xmath4 , described in the previous section .",
    "this assumption is in agreement with the increase of the magnetic susceptibility in the field - cooled sample ( figure [ fig : m(h ) ] ) .",
    "the formation of the domain structure in the case of a cubic - to - tetragonal lattice transition is well studied for ferroelastic systems .",
    "a complicated domain structure consisting of thin twinned domains is usually formed in ferroelastics ( see , for example , recent refs .  ) .",
    "twinning allows to avoid strong local strain at the contact of the domains with different directions of deformation axes .",
    "the thickness of twin domains observed in the doped ferroelastic htsc compound yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath18 is about 10100 nm.@xcite twinning also leads to a slight tilting ( of the order of @xmath19 ) of the domain axes from the corresponding crystallographic axes of the high - temperature phase .",
    "while the axes tilting is too small ( @xmath20 ) to be of importance , small domain thickness could result in excitation of standing spin - waves with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is a domain thickness ) instead of a uniform @xmath23 oscillation .",
    "this size effect can be a possible reason for the slight shift of the resonance absorption position in the fc sample .",
    "this allows to estimate the thickness of the crystallographic domains .",
    "we assume a quadratic spectrum of antiferromagnetic spin - waves    @xmath24    here @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 denotes the exchange coupling constant between nearest - neighbour spins at distance @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , the effective zero - field gap for the standing spin - waves is larger than for the uniform oscillation by @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , the resonance branches of the monodomain ( fc ) sample should be shifted downwards ( on the _ h - f _ plane ) by @xmath30 with respect to the resonance branches of the multidomain ( zfc ) sample : i.e. for the branches rising with the field the remaining absorption component of the fc sample shifts at the given frequency to higher fields with respect to its position in the case of the zfc sample .",
    "this slight shift is observed in the experiment ( figure [ fig : fczfcall ] ) , its magnitude does not exceed the half - width of the absorption line .",
    "we estimate @xmath31 as 1 ghz ( @xmath32 is the planck constant ) .",
    "then , the domain thickness can be estimated as    @xmath33    which yields ( substituting @xmath34  k,@xcite @xmath35=20  ghz , ) @xmath36 .",
    "in further discussion we assume that the domains are thick enough to be considered as bulk antiferromagnet , and that the domain walls do not contribute to the magnetic resonance absorption .",
    "we use the theory of exchange symmetry@xcite to analyze the experimental results . according to this theory ,",
    "if the relativistic effects are much smaller than the exchange interaction , the order parameter can be represented by at most 3 unitary orthogonal vectors which transform by irreducible representations of the crystal symmetry group .",
    "the number of vectors and these representations define the exchange symmetry of the magnet .",
    "this approach allows to describe all symmetry - based properties of a magnet without considering its detailed microscopic structure or any model assumption . for the case of a noncollinear antiferromagnet",
    "the order parameter consists of at least two vectors . in case of only two vectors for the sake of simplicity",
    "we denote @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "we derive the dynamic equations for homogeneous oscillations from the lagrange function @xmath38\\right)^2}-u_a,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the free electron , the constants @xmath40 are related to the eigenvalues of the susceptibility tensor , and the term @xmath41 includes small relativistic corrections to the main exchange part due to spin - orbital and dipole - dipole effects .",
    "these corrections can be expanded by the components of the order parameter .",
    "the first order of the @xmath41 expansion is quadratic on @xmath42 .",
    "the second order terms can be omitted , because they are @xmath43 times smaller , where @xmath44 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "the lagrange function must be invariant under all transformations of the crystallographic symmetry group , which results in some relations between the coefficients in @xmath41 expansion .",
    "these relations vary for different exchange - symmetry groups .",
    "the dynamic equations are obtained by taking a variational derivative of the lagrangian ( [ eqn : lagrangian ] ) over the rotations of the spin space .",
    "these equations should be linearized near the equilibrium position to obtain the eigenfrequencies of small oscillations . in general case , if the magnetic field direction deviates from the eigenvector of the susceptibility tensor , the equilibrium positions can not be determined analytically . to model the observed frequency - field dependences",
    ", we perform numerical calculations of the oscillation eigenfrequencies .",
    "we use standard minimization routines to find an equilibrium orientation of the order parameter .",
    "this modeling procedure is combined with a fitting algorithm using the constants @xmath40 and the coefficients of the @xmath41 expansion as fit parameters .    when performing the expansion of the relativistic corrections , it is necessary to take into account that in the case of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 the magnetic unit cell is larger than the crystallographic one @xcite .",
    "therefore some components of the order parameter are not invariant under some of the translational elements of the crystallographic symmetry group . since the crystal - symmetry group @xmath45 , suggested in ref .",
    ", has a point symmetry @xmath46 in the vertex of the crystallographic cell , we will focus primarily on the point - symmetry subgroup .",
    "note that this special property remains for all subgroups of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , on discussing the lowering of the lattice symmetry below @xmath4 to @xmath47 , we will focus primarily on the point - symmetry subgroup .",
    "although some representations of @xmath46 allow weak ferromagnetism , the susceptibility measurements do not reveal any spontaneous magnetization .",
    "this can be either due to the spontaneous magnetization being too small , or , more likely , there is no weak ferromagnetism for the exchange group in the present case .",
    "therefore , we will not take weak ferromagnetism into account in further discussion .      here",
    "we will demonstrate that the assumption of the tetragonal lattice symmetry in the ordered phase contradicts the experimental observation described in the previous section and the explanation of the experimental findings requires a further reduction to orthorhombic symmetry .",
    "first , we note that the symmetry of the magnetic structure below @xmath48 is lower than tetragonal .",
    "this statement follows directly from the observation of the distinct field - cooling effect for @xmath49 , since this field orientation is equivalent for all tetragonal domains .    for the tetragonal lattice deformation",
    "only three types of different crystallographic domains , differing by the direction of the tetragonal axis @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , can be formed at the transition . since the magnetic symmetry of the ordered phase is lower than the lattice symmetry , two types of magnetic domains with different @xmath52 and @xmath53 axes can be formed in each crystallographic domain . here and further on in this paper",
    "we will denote by @xmath52 and @xmath53 the directions of the two - fold axes perpendicular to the @xmath50 axis ( @xmath54 axis for the @xmath46 symmetry ) .",
    "note that the reduction of the point symmetry from @xmath55 to @xmath46 could be done in two ways : ( i ) by removal of the @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] symmetry axes as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 mirror planes ; ( ii ) by removal of the @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] symmetry axes as well as @xmath62 and @xmath63 mirror planes with the former four - fold axes @xmath64 and @xmath65 becoming two - fold axes . in the second choice of axes the magnetic field aligned along the @xmath14 direction would be equivalent for all domains and there would be no reason for the observed field - cooling effects .",
    "thus , the first possibility has to be realized .",
    "( identification@xcite of the tetragonal phase as @xmath66 also points to the first possibility . ) therefore , @xmath52 and @xmath53 axes are aligned along the diagonals of the cubic facets .",
    ".classification of the afm domains with respect to the cubic axes of the paramagnetic phase [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now all domains can be classified by the orientation of their `` @xmath67 '' basis with respect to the cubic axes of the paramagnetic phase as shown in table [ table ] . some of these domains appear to be equivalent in the particular experimental conditions ( here @xmath68 are the unit vectors in the corresponding directions , trivial cases are combined ) :    @xmath69 $ ]    * domains ( e),(f ) : @xmath70 * domains ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) : @xmath71    @xmath72 $ ]    * domain ( a ) : @xmath73 * domain ( b ) : @xmath74 * domains ( c),(f ) , ( d ) , ( e ) : @xmath75    @xmath76 $ ]    * domains ( a),(c),(e ) : @xmath77 * domains ( b),(d),(f ) : @xmath78    note that for the @xmath49 field orientation there are only two types of different magnetic domains . as one can see from the experimental data in figure [ fig : fit3 ] we observe five resonance branches in this orientation : two originating from the higher gap , two originating from the lower gap and one in the high - field  low - frequency part of the frequency - field diagram .",
    "the observation of this fifth branch indicates the existence of a third zero - field gap which is not observed directly and is less or equal in magnitude than the lowest observed gap of 21  ghz .    to apply the exchange - symmetry theory",
    "as described in the previous subsection it is necessary to specify the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the point symmetry group @xmath46 has two - dimensional and one - dimensional irreducible representations . if @xmath79 and @xmath80 transform by a two - dimensional representation , then @xmath81 and the relativistic contribution to the lagrangian ( [ eqn : lagrangian ] ) has the form    @xmath82    if @xmath83 and @xmath84 transform differently under translations , then @xmath85 . in the other fundamental case ,",
    "if @xmath83 and @xmath84 transform by one - dimensional representations , the relativistic contribution reads    @xmath86    or    @xmath87    depending on the coefficients of the @xmath41 expansion , there are two general possibilities : ( i ) the @xmath88 lie in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 planes ; ( ii ) the @xmath88 lie in the planes including the @xmath50 axis and the bisector of the @xmath91 plane ( i.e. in the @xmath46 group mirror planes ) .",
    "zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 corresponds to the first case , since in the second case for @xmath49 the order parameter vectors @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath92 in all magnetic domains form the same angles with the field direction , which should result in the absence of the field cooling effects .",
    "we tried to fit the experimentally observed frequency - field dependences applying the exchange - symmetry theory as described above .",
    "however , we did not reach any reasonable agreement of the modeled curves with the experiment .",
    "the reason of this disagreement can be explained qualitatively .",
    "namely , it can be proven ( see appendix ) that for the tetragonal @xmath46 point symmetry the domain manifesting a spin reorientation transition becomes indistinguishable from the other domains above the transition field .",
    "this is due to the fact that even for a magnetic symmetry lower than tetragonal , the anisotropic contribution @xmath41 reflects the tetragonal crystal symmetry .",
    "thus , after the spin reorientation transition the reoriented domain appears to be in a state with the zeeman energy lower than before reorientation , but with the same value of the anisotropic term @xmath41 .",
    "the equivalence of the magnetic domains above the transition should provide the same magnetic resonance frequencies above the spin - flop transition .",
    "moreover , there would be no reason for these domains to split again as the magnetic field is reduced to zero .",
    "this , however , contradicts the experimental observation of the specific resonance modes corresponding to the domain undergoing a spin - reorientation above the spin - flop field , as well as to the reproducibility of the low - field domain structure .",
    "the problem can be solved by the assumption that the lattice deformation at @xmath48 involves not only a compression along the @xmath93-direction , but also a weak in - plane deformation leading to further reduction of the symmetry .",
    "there are two options : to exclude mirror planes ( which yields @xmath94 point symmetry ) or to exclude second - order axes ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "as we have shown above , the components of the order parameter lie in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 planes .",
    "this limits our choice to @xmath94 point symmetry ( the corresponding space subgroup of @xmath45 is @xmath47 ( @xmath96 ) ) with second - order axes along @xmath9 directions ( @xmath50 ) , and along @xmath97 directions ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "this assumption provides inequivalent crystallographic domains differing by the @xmath52 and @xmath53 directions .",
    "these orthorhombic distortions were not detected in the earlier structural studies @xcite , most likely because they are probably smaller than the experimental resolution .",
    "we modeled the antiferromagnetic resonance frequency - field dependences assuming orthorhombic distortions below @xmath4 . as was explained above , to write down the expansion of @xmath41 we again will focus on the point - symmetry group .",
    "the @xmath94 symmetry group has four one - dimensional representations .",
    "there are only four fundamentally different cases , the others can be reduced to them by renaming the axes @xmath98 @xmath53 or vectors @xmath83 , @xmath84 :    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    here we again exclude weak ferromagnetism from the consideration .",
    "the first three cases are feasible only if @xmath83 and @xmath84 transform in the same way under translations .",
    "the third case is feasible if @xmath83 and @xmath84 transform by the same one - dimensional irreducible representation .    the low symmetry of the ordered state results in too many free parameters in the equations of spin dynamics ( four to six coefficients in the @xmath41 expansion and two of the three @xmath40 constants ) . by fixing the zero - field gaps of the afm resonance spectrum we can put only three constraints on these parameters .",
    "other constraints are expected to appear during the fitting of the modeled afm resonance spectra .",
    "this involves too many degrees of freedom for the assumptions on the sort of equilibrium position , the way the spin - flop transition takes , and the correspondence between structural domains and resonance branches .",
    "an unequivocal quantitative reproduction of the experimental curves was difficult to achieve , however , a reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed afm resonance spectra was obtained for different sets of parameters and for the different forms of @xmath41 .",
    "here we present the results of modeling the case of @xmath41 taken in the form ( [ eqn : anis2 ] ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : fit3 ] one can see that the correspondence of model and experiment is fairly good .",
    "the correct quantity of resonance branches is obtained .",
    "the values of the zero - field gaps are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "for orientations @xmath12 and @xmath14 the spin - reorientation transitions of certain domains are well reproduced .",
    "our modeling indicates that the frequency - field dependences can be reasonably reproduced assuming a single type of order parameter and taking into account all possible domains .",
    "there are really just two types of discrepancies between the experimental data and modeled curves : first , there are predicted low - frequency modes at high fields which are not observed ; second , for the orientation @xmath12 the modes corresponding to the domain with lowest energy ( @xmath103 ) are far from the experimental data corresponding to the domain stable under field cooling ( see the fit curves and experimental data marked by a , a , b , b in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fit3 ] ) .",
    "these discrepancies can be due to the following reasons : at 9  ghz esr experiments , fields up to only 18  koe were available , whereas above 18  ghz the frequency - field dependences of the low - frequency modes in question are rather flat . in the case of @xmath104",
    "they become field independent which results in a strong broadening of the resonance modes in the experiments at fixed frequency .",
    "thus , these modes can not be detected in a field scan .",
    "concerning the discrepancy for the @xmath103 domain , note that the modeled curves still demonstrate an `` anti - crossing '' which can be enhanced , for example , by higher order terms in the energy expansion .",
    "our modelling demonstrates that the spin - reorientation transition can be realized by a continuous rotation of the order parameter as shown e.g. for the @xmath53 domain in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : e_sub ] .",
    "this explains the absence of a sharp change of the magnetization at the spin - reorientation transition which is simulated in the middle and lower frames of this figure .",
    "the field dependence of the magnetization is qualitatively well reproduced : it demonstrates a nonlinear behavior with a characteristic change during the spin - reorientation for the unfavorable domains , which would disappear after field cooling , and an almost linear behavior for the favorable domains which remains after field cooling . the energy difference between different domains shown in the upper frame of this figure explains the observed field - cooling phenomena .",
    "the domains corresponding to the modes surviving the field cooling have the lowest energy in the magnetic field . for the orientation",
    "@xmath49 the calculated energy difference between the domains is similar and , thus , the field - cooling effect is comparable to the case @xmath105 . for @xmath11",
    "this difference is much smaller which can probably explain the much weaker field - cooling effect for this direction .",
    "however we have to admit the problem in reproducing the experimentally observed anisotropy of the field - cooled magnetization at low fields : the experimentally highest susceptibility for the monodomain fc sample is observed for @xmath12 ( figure [ fig : m(h ) ] ) , while the modelled curves for the presented parameter set indicate a slightly higher susceptibility for the most favorable domain in the @xmath10 ( figure [ fig : e_sub ] ) .",
    "note that the modeled difference of the three favorable domains is tiny , thus for low fields some weak effects related to shape anisotropy or surface effect may distroy the stability of the uniform magnetization .    summarizing the results of our modeling ,",
    "we conclude that the low - energy dynamics of the ordered phase of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 can be described by the assumption of a single type of magnetic order below @xmath4 .",
    "this puts a question mark on the possibility to realize different spin structures in zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 as suggested earlier @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the complications in the determination of the magnetic structure of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 by neutron scattering were caused by the unaccounted orthorhombic deformations and effects of multiple domains .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the low - energy dynamics of the ordered phase of the frustrated antiferromagnetic spinel zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we have proven directly that multiple domains exist below the transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "we have demonstrated that some of these domains are effectively suppressed by field cooling .",
    "spin - reorientation transitions indicated by softening of certain antiferromagnetic resonance modes and by the nonlinear behavior of the magnetization are observed .",
    "these results are incompatible with the earlier proposed symmetry of the distorted lattice .",
    "thus , we conclude that the lattice deformation at the phase transition involves small in - plane distortions besides the tetragonal distortions .",
    "we suggest that the actual symmetry of the lattice below @xmath4 corresponds to the orthorhombic @xmath47 symmetry .",
    "we have demonstrated that the low - energy dynamics can be reasonably described within the framework of the exchange - symmetry theory , assuming a noncollinear magnetic ordering characterized by a single order parameter .",

    "here we will prove that for the @xmath46 point symmetry at the spin - reorientation transition the domain demonstrating this transition becomes indistinguishable from the other domains .",
    "first we consider the case when @xmath83 and @xmath84 transform by two - dimensional representation of @xmath106 minimizing the energy ( [ eqn : ua - d2d-1 ] ) we get the orientation of the order parameter in the absence of magnetic field . for @xmath107",
    "the solution consists vectors lying in the mirror planes , which is not the case of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 ( see above ) . for @xmath108 and @xmath109 the two solutions are @xmath110 , @xmath84 lying in the @xmath90 plane and @xmath111 @xmath83 lying in the @xmath89 plane .",
    "the case of @xmath112 can be reduced to this one by renaming the axes @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these solutions define two different magnetic domains .",
    "if the susceptibility along @xmath92 is less than along @xmath83 and @xmath84 , then for @xmath113 one of the domains is already in its minimum of the zeeman energy .",
    "the other one is not in the minimum and at some value of magnetic field it will undergo a spin - reorientation transition . as it turns out , there is only one possible state for it after the transition , the same as for the first domain .",
    "so after the spin - flop these two domains will be indistinguishable .",
    "if the susceptibility along @xmath83 and @xmath84 is less than along @xmath92 , both domains are not in the minimum of the zeeman energy when the field is applied along the @xmath52 axis . still after the spin - flop",
    "both domains again become indistinguishable .",
    "now we consider case when @xmath83 and @xmath84 transform by one - dimensional representations of @xmath46 .",
    "to define the orientation of the order parameter we minimize the energy ( [ eqn : ua - d2d-2 ] ) .",
    "we get the result that one of the vectors ( let it be @xmath83 ) is aligned in the @xmath91 plane , but its orientation in this plane remains arbitrary . to find a solution ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the next order terms in the @xmath41 expansion .",
    "there is no need to write down all of them , just note that due to the tetragonal symmetry the dependence of @xmath41 on the angle @xmath114 between @xmath83 and @xmath115 is @xmath116 .",
    "there are two sets of solutions depending on the sign of @xmath117 for @xmath118 the solutions are @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath83 lies in the mirror plane , which is not the case of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 . for @xmath120",
    "the solutions are @xmath121 .",
    "these solutions define two magnetic domains : for one of them @xmath110 and for the other @xmath122 first , no matter along which @xmath88 the susceptibility is largest , a spin - reorientation transition is expected for @xmath123 ( i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "this spin - reorientation is either rotation of the order parameter around the @xmath50 axis by @xmath124 or , in the special case of the largest susceptibility being along the @xmath50 axis , rotation of the largest susceptibility direction to the @xmath91 plane .",
    "however , such a transition is not observed in our experiments .",
    "second , the spin - flop transition observed at @xmath49 can be caused only by rotation of the order parameter around the @xmath50 axis , but after this rotation both domains become indistinguishable .",
