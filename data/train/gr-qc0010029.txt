    "the notion of a spacetime foam was introduced by wheeler @xcite for the description of the possible complex structure of the spacetime on the planck scale ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this hypothesized spacetime foam is a set of quantum wormholes ( wh ) ( handles ) appearing in the spacetime on the planck scale level ( see fig.[dzh - fig1 ] ) .",
    "[ dzh - fig1 ]    for the macroscopic observer these quantum fluctuations are smoothed and we have an ordinary smooth manifold with the metric submitting to einstein equations .",
    "the exact mathematical description of this phenomenon is very difficult and even though there is a doubt : does the feynman path integral in the gravity contain a topology change of the spacetime ?",
    "this question spring up because ( according to the morse theory ) the singular points must arise by the topology change .",
    "in such points the time arrow is undefined that leads in difficulties at definition of the lorentzian metric , curvature tensor and so on .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to submit _ * an effective model of the spacetime foam . * _",
    "[ dzh - fig2 ]    at first we present a model of a single handle in the spacetime foam , see fig([dzh - fig2 ] ) .",
    "the 5d metric @xcite for the throat is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the 5@xmath4 extra coordinate ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 are the @xmath8 polar coordinates ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are some constants .",
    "we can see that there are two closed @xmath11 hypersurfaces at the @xmath12 . in some sense",
    "these hypersurfaces are like to the event horizon and in ref.@xcite such hypersurfaces are named as a @xmath13-holes . on these hypersurfaces",
    "we should join @xcite :    * the flux of the 4d electric field ( defined by the maxwell equations ) with the flux of the 5d electric field defined by @xmath14 kaluza - klein equation . *",
    "the area of the reissner - nordstrm event horizon with the area of the @xmath11 hypersurface .",
    "it is necessary to note that both solutions ( reissner - nordstrm black hole and 5d throat ) have only two integration constants and on the event horizon takes place an algebraic relation between these 4d and 5d integration constants .",
    "another explanation of the fact that we use only two joining condition is the following ( see ref.@xcite for the more detailed explanations ) : in some sense on the event horizon holds a `` holography principle '' .",
    "this means that in the presence of the event horizon the 4d and 5d einstein equations lead to a reduction of the amount of initial data .",
    "for example the einstein - maxwell equations for the reissner - nordstrm metric @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the electromagnetic potential , @xmath17 is the gravitational constant ) can be written as @xmath18 for the reissner - nordstrm black hole the event horizon is defined by the condition @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the radius of the event horizon .",
    "hence in this case we see that on the event horizon @xmath21 here ( g ) means that the corresponding value is taken on the event horizon .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ dzh - eq2 - 3 ] ) , which is the einstein equation , is a first - order differential equations in the whole spacetime @xmath22 .",
    "the condition ( [ dzh - eq2 - 5 ] ) tells us that the derivative of the metric on the event horizon is expressed through the metric value on the event horizon .",
    "this is the same what we said above : the reduction of the amount of initial data takes place by such a way that we have only two integration constants ( mass @xmath23 and charge @xmath24 for the reissner - nordstrm solution and @xmath10 and @xmath25 for the 5d throat ) .",
    "the 5d throat has an interesting property @xcite .",
    "we see that the signs of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 are not defined .",
    "we remark that this 5d metric is located behind the event horizon therefore the 4d observer is not able to determine the signs of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "moreover this 5d metric can fluctuate between these two possibilities .",
    "hence the external 4d observer is forced to describe such composite wh by means of something like spinor .",
    "another interesting characteristic property of this solution is that we have the flux of electric field through the throat , _ i.e. _ each mouth can entrap the electric force lines and this leads that this mouth is like to electric charge for the external 4d observer , see fig.[dzh - fig2a ] .",
    "we can neglect the cross section of the throat and in this case each mouth is point - like and we can try to describe these mouthes with help of some effective field .",
    "taking into account the spinor - like properties of quantum handles , we assume that _ * spacetime foam can be described with help of an effective spinor field . * _",
    "the physical meaning of the spinor field depends on the method of attaching the quantum handles to the external space , see fig.([dzh - fig3 ] ) .      in this case",
    "@xmath28 is a density of the mouthes in the external space and @xmath29 is a density of the electric charge @xcite .    following this way we write differential equations for the gravitational + electromagnetic fields in the presence of the spacetime foam @xmath30 as follows @xmath31 } - m \\right ) \\psi & = & 0 , \\label{dzh - eq4}\\\\ d_\\nu f^{\\mu\\nu } = 4\\pi e \\left ( { \\bar\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu   \\psi \\right ) , & & \\label{dzh - eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for our model we use the following ansatz : the spherically symmetric metric @xmath32 the electromagnetic potential @xmath33 and the spinor field @xmath34 the following is _ very important _ for us : the ansatz ( [ dzh - eq8 ] ) for the spinor field @xmath35 has the @xmath36 component of the energy - momentum tensor and the @xmath37 component of the current .",
    "let we remind that @xmath35 determines the stochastical gas of the virtual wh s which can not have a preferred direction in the spacetime .",
    "this means that after substitution expression ( [ dzh - eq6])-([dzh - eq8 ] ) into field equations they should be averaged by the spin direction of the ansatz ( [ dzh - eq8 ] ) . after this",
    "averaging we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 and we have the following equations system describing our spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath40 where @xmath17 is some constant .",
    "this equations system was investigated in @xcite and result is the following .",
    "a particle - like solution exists which has the following expansions near @xmath41 @xmath42 and the following asymptotical behaviour @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass for the observer at infinity and @xmath45 is the charge of this solution .",
    "the solution exists for both cases @xmath46 and @xmath47 but for us is essential the first case with @xmath46 . in this case",
    "the classical einstein - maxwell theory leads to the `` naked '' singularity .",
    "the presence of the spacetime foam drastically changes this result : * _ the appearance of the virtual wormholes can prevent the formation of the `` naked '' singularuty in the reissner - nordstrm solution with @xmath48_*.    our interpretation of this solution is presented on the fig.([dzh - fig4 ] ) .      the second possibitiy @xcite is presented on the fig.([dzh - fig5 ] ) .",
    "we will consider the 5d kaluza - klein theory + torsion + spinor field .",

    "the most interesting for us is the maxwell equation ( [ dzh - eq23 ] ) which permits us to discuss the physical meaning of the spinor field .",
    "we would like to show that this equation in the given form is similar to the electrodynamic in the continuous media .",
    "let we remind that for the electrodynamic in the continuous media two tensors @xmath82 and @xmath83 are introduced @xcite for which we have the following equations system ( in the minkowski spacetime ) @xmath84 and the following relations between these tensors @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the dielectric and magnetic permeability respectively , @xmath88 is the 4-vector of the matter . for the rest media and in the 3d designation we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the dielectric polarization and @xmath91 is the magnetization vectors , @xmath92 is the 3d absolutely antisymmetric tensor . comparing with",
    "the ( [ dzh - eq23 ] ) maxwell equation for the spacetime foam in the 3d form @xmath93 we see that the following notations can be introduced .",

    "the physical reason for this is evidently : each quantum wh is like to a moving dipole ( see fig.([dzh - fig6 ] ) which produces microscopical electric and magnetic fields .",
    "from the above - mentioned arguments we see that the most important for such kind models of the spacetime foam is the presence of the nonminimal interaction term ( in lagrangian ) between spinor and electromagnetic fields .",
    "let we note that the n=2 supergravity @xcite which contains the vier - bein @xmath96 , majorana rarita - schwinger field @xmath97 , photon @xmath16 and a second majorana spin-@xmath98 field @xmath99 has the following term in lagrangian @xmath100 the term like this usually occur in supergravities which have some gauge multiplet of supergravity and some matter multiplet .",
    "taking into account the previous reasonings we can suppose that * _ supergravity theories can be considered as approximate models of the spacetime foam . _ *",
    "thus , here we have proposed the approximate model for the description of the spacetime foam .",
    "this model is based on the assumption that the whole spacetime is 5 dimensional but @xmath101 is the dynamical variable only in the quantum topological handles ( wormholes ) . in this case 5d",
    "gravity has the solution which we have used as a model of the single quantum wormhole . the properties of this solution is such that we can assume that the quantum topological handles ( wormholes ) can be approximately described by some effective spinor field .    the topological handles of the spacetime foam either can be attached to one space or connect two different spaces . in the first case we have something like to strings between two @xmath13-branes ( or wormhole with the quantum throat ) and such object can demonstrate a model of preventing the formation the naked singularity with relation @xmath0 . in the second case",
    "the spacetime foam looks as a dielectric with quantum handles as dipoles .",
    "such model leads to the very interesting experimental consequences .",
    "we see that the spacetime foam has 5d structure and it connected with the electric field .",
    "this observation allows us to presuppose that the very strong electric field can open a door into 5 dimension !",
    "the question is : as is great should be this field ?",
    "the electric field @xmath102 in the cgse units and @xmath103 in the `` geometrized '' units can be connected by formula @xmath104 & = & cm^{-1 } , \\quad \\left [ e_i\\right ] = v / cm \\label{dzh - eq38}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we see the value of @xmath103 is defined by some characteristic length @xmath105 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath105 is a length of the @xmath106 dimension .",
    "if @xmath107 then @xmath108 and this field strength is in the planck region , and is will beyond experimental capabilities to create .",
    "but if @xmath105 has a different value it can lead to much more realistic scenario for the experimental capability to open door into @xmath106 dimension .    another interesting conclusion of this paper is that supergravity theories having nonminimal interaction between spinor and electromagnetic fileds _ * can be considered as approximate and effective models of the spacetime foam*_.",
