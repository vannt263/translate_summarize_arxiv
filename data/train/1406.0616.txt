    "interfacial phenomena are ubiquitous in the physics of condensed matter and materials science : nucleation of droplets @xcite in a supersaturated vapor ( or nucleation of bubbles in an undersaturated liquid ) is controlled by a competition between the free energy cost of forming an interface and gain in free energy ( resulting from the fact that the stable phase has a lower free energy than the metastable one ) . of course",
    ", related phenomena occur in more complex systems ( crystal nucleation from the melt , formation of nematic or smectic droplets in fluids which can form liquid crystal phases etc . ) and in various solid phases ( nucleation of ferroelectric or ferromagnetic domains driven by appropriate fields , etc . ) . in complex fluids and biosystems heterogeneous structures ( such as mesophases of strongly segregated block copolymers @xcite ) are often maintained in thermal equilibrium , due to an interplay of various free energy contributions , one of them being an interfacial tension .",
    "stable heterogeneous structures can also be stabilized in fluids due to the effect of confining walls , e.g. wetting layers @xcite and nanosystems @xcite .",
    "thus , the prediction of the excess free energy due to an interface between coexisting phases is a basic task of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "although this has been recognized since a long time @xcite , and mean - field type approaches have been developed and are widely used e.g.  @xcite , such theories are not based on a firm ground : the existence of a well - defined `` intrinsic interfacial profile '' is doubtful @xcite ; an inevitable input is the free energy density of homogeneous states @xcite throughout the two - phase coexistence region : this is again a concept valid for systems with long range forces @xcite , but ill - defined in the short - range case @xcite .",
    "while the bulk phase behavior often can be accounted for rather well by mean - field type theories ( apart from the neighborhood of critical points , of course , but there the neglected long wave length fluctuations and the effects caused by them can be well accounted for by renormalization group theory @xcite ) , this is not the case for interfacial phenomena .",
    "interfaces ( between fluid phases ) have fluctuations on all length scales , and although their long wavelength part ( capillary waves @xcite ) is well understood , the interplay of short wavelengths with fluctuations in the bulk is not yet well understood @xcite . thus one can not improve the mean - field results by fluctuation corrections systematically .    in view of this dilemma , the prediction of interfacial free energies by computer simulation methods @xcite is very important . for many model systems of statistical mechanics",
    ", computer simulation methods can very accurately predict the equation of state , and thermodynamic properties derivable from it @xcite .",
    "of course , computer simulations deal with systems of finite size , and hence finite - size effects need to be carefully considered @xcite , in particular near critical points or if dealing with phase coexistence .",
    "however , finite - size scaling concepts for such problems have been established since a long time @xcite and are very successful @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , with respect to finite - size effects on interfacial phenomena the situation is less satisfactory , although the problem has also been considered since a long time @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present paper takes up this task again , reconsidering the finite - size effects on interfacial tensions for archetypical model systems , such as the ising model in @xmath6 and @xmath7 dimensions , and the lennard - jones fluid .",
    "our work is based on several ingredients :    * by further adaptation of the recently developed ensemble switch method @xcite , a computationally very efficient alternative to existing approaches has become available . * the computational power of recently available computer hardware exceeds the power that was available 20 to 30 years ago , when most previous studies of this problem were done but led to less conclusive results , by many orders of magnitude . * unlike most previous work , we vary both the linear dimension @xmath8 parallel to the interface and the linear dimension @xmath2 perpendicular to it systematically . we find that this aspect is crucial to unambiguously identify the sources of the various effects .",
    "* we compare systematically the results obtained choosing different boundary conditions ( e.g. , periodic versus antiperiodic in the ising model ) and different ensembles ( conserved or nonconserved density when we interpret the ising system as lattice gas ) .    due to these ingredients ( i)-(iv )",
    ", we have been able to discover a new mechanism of interfacial fluctuations ( `` domain breathing '' ) , which has not been mentioned in the previous literature .",
    "apart from the domain breathing mechanism , known effects like the translational entropy of the interface and capillary wave effects play a major role for our study .    as a disclaimer",
    ", we emphasize that some important aspects will not be studied in this work : we will not address the interesting crossover @xcite of these finite - size effects towards those associated with the critical point , where the interfacial tension vanishes ; we also ignore the anisotropy of the interfacial tension ( which is present also in the ising model @xcite , and very important when approaching ( in @xmath7 ) the roughening transition @xcite ( or zero temperature , in @xmath6 ) . of course , this anisotropy must not be ignored when one considers crystal - fluid interfaces @xcite .",
    "we plan to study the latter in future work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenomenologicaltheory ] , we describe in detail ( a brief summary was already presented in a letter @xcite ) the phenomenological theory of the logarithmic finite - size effects on interfacial tensions . in sec .  [",
    "sec : modelsandsimulationmethods ] , we briefly characterize the models that are studied , and describe the ensemble switch method that is used in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "[ sec : numericalresults ] describes our numerical results for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 ising model and a @xmath7 lennard - jones fluid , by which our theoretical predictions are tested .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] gives a summary and an outlook on open problems .",
    "for simplicity , in most of our discussions we shall focus on the ferromagnetic ising system with nearest neighbor interactions of strength @xmath9",
    ", i.e.  described by the hamiltonian on a square or simple cubic lattice , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the sum over all nearest neighbor pairs , and @xmath12 is the magnetic field , which is set to zero throughout this work .",
    "we focus on coexisting phases , described for temperatures @xmath13 less than the critical temperature @xmath14 by states with positive or negative spontaneous magnetization , @xmath15 .",
    "motivated by the interpretation of the ising magnet as a lattice gas model ( where @xmath16 means that the lattice site @xmath17 is empty , while @xmath18 means that the lattice site @xmath17 is occupied by a particle ) , we denote the @xmath19 ensemble as `` grandcanonical '' ( gc ) and the @xmath20 ensemble as `` canonical '' ( c ) . here",
    "@xmath21 is defined as the magnetization per spin , @xmath22 where we have already anticipated that we take a lattice of linear dimension @xmath2 in the @xmath23-direction , while the linear dimension in the other direction(s ) is taken to be  @xmath8 .",
    "remember that in the lattice gas version of the model , the density @xmath24 , and @xmath12 is related to the chemical potential difference relative to the chemical potential @xmath25 where phase coexistence occurs , @xmath26 .",
    "next we discuss the boundary conditions that are used to stabilize one or two interfaces between coexisting phases in the system .",
    "a very natural choice is the use of free surfaces with neighboring fixed spins in the @xmath23-direction : using the lattice spacing @xmath27 as unit of length , all spins in the plane ( or row in @xmath6 ) @xmath28 are fixed at @xmath18 and the spins in the plane @xmath29 are fixed at @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionsfreesurfaces ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we may use boundary magnetic fields @xmath30 in the plane ( row ) @xmath28 and @xmath31 in the plane @xmath29 , and spins in the planes @xmath32 , @xmath33 are missing . in the remaining direction(s ) , periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "this choice of boundary conditions is straightforwardly generalized to off - lattice systems which lack the special symmetry against spin reversal of the ising model .",
    "e.g. , for a lennard - jones fluid ( or a polymer solution where the solvent is treated implicitly only @xcite ) , instead of the free surfaces with fixed spins , one uses two hard walls , where one wall is purely repulsive , favoring the vapor ( or solvent - rich phase , in the case of the polymer solution ) while the other wall has an attractive potential .",
    "similar choices also apply when one studies systems containing a single solid - liquid interface @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the properties of the system near these free surfaces or walls differ from the bulk properties over some range , and so @xmath2 has to be chosen large enough so that the effect of an effective potential that the wall exerts on the interface becomes negligible .",
    "the effect of this potential becomes appreciable under conditions where the system in the thermodynamic limit would undergo a wetting transition , while for @xmath2 finite but @xmath34 interface localization /",
    "delocalization transitions can occur @xcite .",
    "one must then make sure to work under conditions deep inside the phase where the interface is preferentially in the center of the system , near @xmath35 , and never close to the walls .",
    "this problem can be avoided for the ising model ( and other symmetric systems , e.g. a symmetric binary lennard jones mixture @xcite ) by using the antiperiodic boundary condition ( apbc ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionsapbc ] , which is equivalent to the choice that spins in the planes @xmath28 and @xmath29 interact antiferromagnetically",
    ". then the system retains its translational invariance in the @xmath23-direction .    however , perhaps the most frequently used choice is to use periodic boundary conditions in all directions , and focus on states of the system where both coexisting phases are present in the system , separated by two domain walls ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionspbc ] ) .    note that we normally use @xmath2 larger than @xmath8 ( sometimes it is advantageous to use @xmath36 ) but one has to be careful in not using a too large value of @xmath2 : we wish to have a situation where in the grandcanonical ensemble systems with apbc ( or with fixed spin boundary conditions ) are dominated by states with two domains separated by a single interface ( as anticipated in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditions ] ) rather than by a larger even number of domains and hence a larger odd number of interfaces .",
    "likewise , in the pbc case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionspbc ] ) the system in the grandcanonical ensemble will in fact be dominated by the pure phases @xmath37 without any interfaces , and the shown state with two interfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionspbc ] ) occurs as a rare fluctuation , but states with 4 , 6 or more interfaces are comparatively negligible .",
    "in fact , for @xmath38 at fixed @xmath8 , the resulting quasi - one dimensional system splits into a sequence of infinitely many domains , the typical distance between domain walls ( which is the correlation length of spin correlations in @xmath23-direction ) is given by @xcite @xmath39 with @xmath40 where the length @xmath41 is the width of an interface with lateral dimension(s ) @xmath8 , and @xmath42 is the interfacial tension in the limit @xmath34 . here and in the following , the interfacial tension is always normalized by the thermal energy @xmath43 , @xmath44 being boltzmann s constant , and is therefore given in units of inverse ( @xmath45)-dimensional area .",
    "in eq .   the results from capillary wave broadening of the interface ( see e.g.  @xcite ) have been anticipated .",
    "strictly speaking , the prefactor in eq .   for lattice systems",
    "is not @xmath46 but rather @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the `` interfacial stiffness '' @xcite , but this difference is not of interest here .",
    "we shall discuss eqs .",
    ",   in later subsections ; here we only emphasize that the simulations need to be carried out in the regime @xmath49 in order to ensure that only states with one interface ( figs .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionsfreesurfaces ] and  [ fig : boundaryconditionsapbc ] ) or at most two interfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionspbc ] ) are sampled .",
    "apart from the critical region ( remember that @xmath50 as @xmath51 @xcite ) , the exponential variation of @xmath52 with the interfacial area @xmath53 ensures that for reasonably large @xmath8 the length @xmath52 is extremely large , and so the condition @xmath49 is easily fulfilled .",
    "when one approaches the critical region , it is necessary to choose @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the correlation length of order parameter fluctuations in the bulk .",
    "we also observe that sampling the order parameter distribution @xmath56 in the grandcanonical ensemble using pbc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionspbc ] ) can also serve as a check that one works in the proper regime of @xmath8 and @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : probdistributions ] ) . for studies of the interfacial tension ,",
    "the distribution must have two sharp peaks at @xmath57 and a flat ( essentially horizontal ) minimum near @xmath58 , with @xmath59 many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath60 ; note the logarithmic scale of the ordinate in fig .",
    "[ fig : probdistributions ] : if the minimum is shallow and rounded , we can conclude that @xmath8 is not large enough ; if instead of a minimum we observe a broad maximum near @xmath58 , we can conclude that for the chosen value of @xmath8 the perpendicular linear dimension @xmath2 is too large , and states with more than two domain walls contribute @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : probdistributionslargelz ] , where we have deliberately chosen a small value of @xmath8 ( @xmath61 ) , one can recognize that already for @xmath62 , there is a flat local maximum at @xmath63 , rather than a minimum , due to the fact that the sampling is  contaminated \" by states with 4 ( rather than only 2 ) interfaces ; for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , this effect is so pronounced , that the method based on the analysis of @xmath66 is inapplicable . for @xmath67 , we have multi - domain states .",
    "as will be discussed below , the actual dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath8 and @xmath2 contains the desired information on the interfacial tension @xcite , but only if states with more than two domains make negligible contributions .",
    "when we consider an ising chain at low temperatures , the correlation length is very large , @xmath69 @xcite , and the associated free energy per spin is @xmath70 .",
    "the state of the system can be characterized by a sequence of large domains of parallel spins , with an average size @xcite @xmath71 , separated by `` interfaces '' where the spin orientation changes .",
    "thus , the system can be viewed as a dilute gas of randomly distributed interfaces .",
    "the cost of energy to create such an interface is @xmath72 , and the gain in ( translational ) entropy is @xmath73 .",
    "as is well known , and can be shown explicitly by transfer matrix methods @xcite , this picture carries over to two - dimensional ising strips of width @xmath8 ( with pbc in the direction across the strip ) , where one finds @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the exactly known @xcite interface tension of the two - dimensional ising model , normalized by @xmath43 ( and hence having the dimension of inverse length , the unit of length being the lattice spacing @xmath27 ) @xmath76 eq .   coincides with the field - theoretic result eq .   in the case of @xmath6 , as it should be .",
    "while the free energy cost of an interface in the ising chain is @xmath72 , in the ising strip it is @xmath77 the logarithmic correction in this expression was interpreted by fisher @xcite as a result of an effective repulsive interaction between interfaces due to their capillary wave excitations .",
    "if we again view the ising strip at low temperatures as a dilute gas of domain walls separating large domains of opposite order parameter , it is natural to ask what the free energy difference @xmath78 between a system with one domain wall on a length @xmath2 and a system in a monodomain configuration on the same length scale is .",
    "taking the entropy gain of putting the interface anywhere on this scale @xmath2 into account , we conclude @xcite @xmath79 where we have normalized @xmath2 with some intrinsic length @xmath80 of the system , such that the ratio @xmath81 `` counts '' the number of distinct configurations containing one ( coarse - grained ) interface on the scale @xmath2 . in the one - dimensional ising chain , where no internal degrees of freedom are associated with the `` kink '' separating a domain of up spins from a domain of down spins , and the kink can appear between any two neighboring lattice sites ,",
    "the length @xmath80 simply is the lattice spacing @xmath82 .",
    "however , all the configurational degrees of freedom associated with an interface in higher dimensions are already included in @xmath83 , and must not be included again in the translational entropy term in eq .  , to avoid double counting",
    "; thus we expect that @xmath80 will be much larger than the lattice spacing , and a plausible assumption is to identify @xmath80 with the interfacial width @xmath41 , as written in eqs .  ,  , see also fig .  [",
    "fig : translationalentropy ] . from eq .",
    "we conclude that @xmath84 for @xmath85 , with @xmath86 thus , when we have a single interface in the system , an interpretation of correction terms as being due to repulsive interactions between interfaces lacks plausibility . if we rather use the interpretation used in fig .",
    "[ fig : translationalentropysketch ] , that we can work with non - interacting interfaces where an interface needs a space of extent @xmath87 in @xmath23-direction , any such problems are avoided , and eq .",

    "we also note that eq .",
    "is valid for is readily generalized to arbitrary dimension , by stating that the translational entropy gain of an interface in a @xmath88 geometry causes a correction term to the interfacial tension @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , namely @xmath91 recall that in the classical limit of quantum systems the length used for counting the states for the translational entropy is the thermal de broglie wavelength . here",
    ", we deal with purely classical statistical mechanics , hence the use of another physical length of the system , such as @xmath41 , is more appealing . in @xmath6 ,",
    "the exact transfer matrix results show that in geometries such as fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionsfreesurfaces ] and  [ fig : boundaryconditionsapbc ] , for large @xmath2 and large @xmath8 the interfacial tension can be written as @xmath92 , which implies that capillary wave effects are already fully accounted for through @xmath41 in eq .  .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we briefly recall what is known on the finite - size effects on the interfacial tension due to capillary waves @xcite . ignoring the intrinsic interfacial structure ,",

    "we have focused on the use of a simulation geometry where the linear dimension @xmath317 of the simulation box in the direction(s ) parallel to the interface differs from the linear dimension perpendicular to the interface @xmath318 .",
    "using periodic boundary conditions in all ( two or three ) space directions , the situation that is normally considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionspbc ] ) is a `` slab geometry '' , where ( for a fluid system ) a domain of the liquid phase is separated by two planar interfaces ( that are connected in themselves via the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in the direction(s ) parallel to the interface ) from the vapor phase ( the two vapor regions on the left and on the right of the liquid slab are connected by the periodic boundary condition in @xmath23-direction ) .",
    "this choice of geometry also applies to other systems ( fluid binary mixture , ising magnets , etc ) . for systems exhibiting a strict symmetry between both coexisting phases ( ising model , symmetrical binary lennard - jones mixture , etc . )",
    "also a simpler choice with a single interface is useful , where the boundary condition in the @xmath23-direction is antiperodic ( apbc ) rather than periodic .",
    "while for the situation with the pbc in @xmath23-direction we consider here only the canonical ensemble ( conserved density of the fluid , or conserved relative concentration of the binary mixture , or conserved magnetization in the ising magnet , respectively ) , for the systems with apbc it is instructive to study both the case of the canonical ( c ) ensemble and the case of the grandcanonical ( gc ) ensemble ( where the respective order parameter , i.e. , density , concentration , or magnetization , respectively , is not conserved , and the variable that is thermodynamically conjugate to this order parameter is fixed at the value that is appropriate for bulk two - phase coexistence ) .",
    "while in this apbc(c ) case the position of the interface on average is fixed ( by the chosen value of the order parameter ) , for the apbc(gc ) case it is not , and the statistical fluctuation associated with this degree of freedom needs to be carefully considered . as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : systemgeometryandboundaryconditions ] , this translational degree of freedom of the interface gives rise to an entropic correction to the interfacial tension .",
    "likewise , in the pbc case the liquid slab can be translated in the system as a whole , and this also shows up as a logarithmic correction .",
    "but additional corrections arise as a consequence of the coupling between fluctuations of the bulk order parameter in the coexisting domains and the interface location ( created by the constraint that there can not be a net fluctuation of the total order parameter in the canonical ensemble , and so the individual fluctuations of the order parameter densities in both domains must be compensated by a suitable interface displacement ) .",
    "this so - called `` domain breathing '' effect causes an entropic correction for both the pbc and apbc(c ) cases .",
    "we have given detailed evidence for these effects both in the case of the two - dimensional @xmath319 and three - dimensional @xmath320 ising model .",
    "note that for the @xmath6 ising model capillary - wave type fluctuations of the interface affect these interfacial entropy corrections strongly as well , since the root mean squared interfacial width @xmath321 scales like @xmath322 \\{eq .  }",
    ", and via the normalization of the translational entropy this gives rise to an additional @xmath323 correction to the interfacial tension .",
    "all the methods that we discuss here rely on the consideration of the free energy difference between one of the systems discussed above and a system with the same linear dimensions but pbc throughout , so that no interfaces occur .",
    "hence , it is necessary neither to locate where the interface is in the system , nor to characterize its microscopic structure .",
    "this free energy difference can either be found from sampling the order parameter distribution function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : probdistributions ] ) across the two - phase coexistence region ( which is a standard approach used since more than three decades ) or from a new variant of the `` ensemble switch '' method ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ensembleswitchmethodsketch ] ) , described here . in this method ,",
    "two bulk systems of size @xmath324 , with pbc containing the two coexisting phases , are connected in phase space via a continuous path to a system of size @xmath88 , where now the two phases coexist in one box , being separated by two interfaces .",
    "we stress that these techniques by no means are the only methods from which interfacial tensions can be found : it is also possible to study the @xmath88 system in the grandcanonical ensemble , and analyze the correlation function along the @xmath23-direction very precisely .",
    "most of the time the system will reside in one of the pure phases , but the rare fluctuation where the system explores slab configurations gives rise to a nontrivial behavior of the correlation function , from which the interfacial tension can be extracted @xcite .",
    "this method is out of our scope here , as well as the possibility to extract the interfacial stiffness from an analysis of the capillary wave spectrum or from the size - dependence of the interfacial broadening . in both these methods",
    "the error estimation is a very subtle problem .",
    "alternative algorithms due to mon @xcite and caselle et  al .",
    "@xcite which are particularly valuable to study the interfacial tension near the bulk critical point , have also been out of our consideration .    however , also for the methods described here the assessment of errors is rather difficult . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : translationalentropy ] , it is clear that the translational entropy of the interface is only sampled correctly if the simulation has lasted long enough that the slowly diffusing interface has in fact sampled the full extension @xmath2 of the sample .",
    "we have seen in the last section that in particular for off - lattice models of fluids ( such as the lennard - jones system ) this is difficult to achieve . in analytical theories",
    "@xcite , this problem is avoided by putting the system into a potential that localizes the interface .",
    "the price to be paid is that a correlation length @xmath325 is created , that characterizes the extent of interfacial motions around its average position in @xmath23-direction @xcite .",
    "while the theory from the outset is based on the concept of an effective interfacial hamiltonian , it is desirable to avoid this concept in a simulation context . of course",
    ", using the pbc(c ) method where a liquid slab occurs , we can `` localize '' the whole slab , e.g.  by using a weak harmonic potential , centered around the center of mass position of the liquid slab .",
    "but one needs to carefully check that this potential does not affect other properties , apart from eliminating the translational motion of the slab as a whole .",
    "such ideas probably are indispensable , when one considers the extension of the method to liquid - solid interfaces , where it is simply too time - consuming to sample the translational motion of the crystalline slab . as a caveat we note , however , that we do not see an obvious recipe to suppress the `` domain breathing '' mechanism .",
    "of course , if one uses a model based on the effective interface hamiltonian concept , this mechanism has been disregarded from the outset ; but the step linking explicitly atomistic hamiltonians to effective interface hamiltonians is problematic as well .",
    "an extension that would also be very interesting to consider already for the ising systems is the consideration of interfaces that are inclined relative to the simple ( 100 ) or ( 001 ) lattice planes : this extension would allow to study the anisotropy of the interface tension , which is well understood in @xmath6 @xcite but not explicitly known in @xmath7 , apart from special cases @xcite .",
    "such inclined interfaces naturally arise in the context of heterogeneous nucleation at walls @xcite , for instance .",
    "another aspect of interest are finite - size effects on the interface tension of spherical droplets .",
    "we plan to report on such extensions in the future .",
