    "the study of the gaussianity of the primordial density fluctuations is a very important tool in constraining theories of structure formation . inside the inflationary paradigm",
    ", there is a huge number of theories ( see @xcite for a recent review on the subject ) , each one predicting different non - gaussian signatures .",
    "thus , any detection of non - gaussianity would help to discriminate among these scenarios for the generation of cosmological perturbations . because of this reason , the study of the gaussianity of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps is becoming of major importance in modern cosmology .",
    "in particular , since the publication of the first year wmap results @xcite , several groups have tested the non - gaussian nature of those maps using a wide set of techniques @xcite",
    ".    furthermore , there are other reasons showing the importance of the study of the gaussianity of the cmb .",
    "the majority of the inflationary models predict the primordial non - gaussian signal to be smaller than the contribution from secondary effects such as gravitational lensing , reionization , sunyaev - zeldovich effect , or the contribution of local foregrounds or unresolved point sources in the maps .",
    "thus , tools to test gaussianity could be used to trace the presence of these foregrounds .",
    "for example , the analysis of the wmap data using the bispectrum allowed @xcite to perform estimates of the source number counts of unresolved sources in the 41  ghz channel ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , systematic effects may produce spurious detections of non - gaussianities , so non - gaussian methods could help in characterizing the properties of a given experiment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gaussianity of the vsa data was already examined using several methods in two separate papers @xcite , which were based on the data presented in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , a selection of non - gaussianity tests",
    "are applied to the data .",
    "most of these tests are based on real - space statistics and are applied to the maximum - entropy reconstruction of the regions observed by the instrument . in @xcite , the analysis is devoted to the study of the bispectrum of the vsa data , showing how this statistic can be obtained in the case of interferometric experiments . in this paper , we present the results of a gaussianity analysis of the complete set of observations of the very small array ( vsa ) dedicated to measure the cmb power spectrum ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as well as an analysis of the data from the corona - borealis supercluster survey presented in @xcite . here",
    ", we will complement the previous gaussianity studies of the vsa data by considering a different family of methods , called the smooth tests of goodness of fit ( stgof ) .    in section 2",
    ", we give a brief overview of the vsa experiment .",
    "in section 3 , we review the smooth tests of goodness of fit methods , and how these method can be adapted to the study of the gaussianity of interferometric experiments .",
    "section 4 describes how these methods can be further adapted to deal with large datasets or mosaiced observations .",
    "section 5 presents the calibration of the method using gaussian simulations of mosaiced observations with the vsa .",
    "section 6 presents the results of our analysis , and finally conclusions are presented in section 7 .",
    "the vsa is a 14-element heterodyne interferometer sited at the teide observatory ( tenerife ) .",
    "the instrument is designed to image the cmb on scales going from @xmath6 to 10 , and operates at frequencies between @xmath7 and @xmath8  ghz with a @xmath9  ghz bandwidth and a system temperature of @xmath10  k. the vsa has observed in two configurations of antennas .",
    "the first one is the so - called compact configuration , which covers the multipole range @xmath11 with a primary beam of @xmath12-fwhm at 34.1  ghz .",
    "this configuration was used during the first observing season ( september 2000- september 2001 ) .",
    "the results of this campaign are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second one , the extended configuration , provided observations up to @xmath13 with a primary beam of @xmath14-fwhm ( at @xmath15  ghz ) and an angular resolution of 11  arcmin during two separate campaigns .",
    "those results were presented in two separate sets of papers : @xcite for the second season of observations ( september 2001 - april 2002 ) ; and @xcite for the third one ( april 2002- january 2003 ) , where we obtained maps both at 34.1  ghz and at 33  ghz . with this extended configuration",
    ", we have obtained maps of a complete , x - ray flux - limited sample of seven clusters with redshifts @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we have also produced imaging at @xmath15  ghz of the corona - borealis supercluster @xcite , with the aim of searching for sunyaev - zeldovich detections from a possible extended signal due to diffuse warm / hot gas .",
    "as shown in that paper , we found a strong decrement near the centre of the supercluster , which can not be associated either with primordial cmb fluctuations or with a sz effect from a known cluster of galaxies in the region .",
    "therefore , we shall consider these data in our gaussianity analysis as well .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our results",
    "are presented in table  [ tab : results ] , for the case of @xmath17 .",
    "the total number of visibility points in the binned files is also shown in the second column of that table . all the results are compatible with a gaussian distribution , except in three cases where we obtain values for the statistics with a significance greater than @xmath18 .",
    "these cases are the mosaics for the vsa2 and vsa3 fields obtained with the first release of the extended configuration ( fields vsa2e , vsa2f and vsa2 g , and vsa3e , vsa3f and vsa3 g , respectively ) , and the corona - borealis mosaic ( quoted as coronab ) . in these three cases , there is apparently a detection with the @xmath19 statistic , which may indicate either a deviation from the theoretical power spectrum or a non - gaussian signature ( as shown for instance for cosmic strings in a05 ) .",
    "we now discuss each of these three cases in detail .",
    "an individual analysis of the three fields of the mosaic shows that vsa2e is compatible with gaussianity ( @xmath20 ) , while the vsa2f ( @xmath21 ) and vsa2 g ( @xmath22 ) present a strong deviation .",
    "if we now split the vsa2f and vsa2 g datasets into two parts , corresponding to two separate epochs , we find that the non - gaussian signal is present in both of them , and for both pointings .",
    "this result suggests that the origin of the signal is intrinsic to the data , because it can not be isolated in a separated epoch . in order to localise the origin of this signal in fourier space",
    ", we performed the analysis using the @xmath23 anulii regions mentioned above , and defined in table  [ tab : bins ] . in order to keep a reasonable number of data points in this `` bin analysis '' , we now use a lower value for @xmath24 .",
    "the detailed analysis shows that the non - gaussian signal in @xmath19 associated with vsa2f is localised in bins 9 and 11 , while the non - gaussianity associated to vsa2 g comes from bins 9 , 10 and 11 .    the following step , in",
    "order to cross - check these results , is to use the independent reduction of these two pointings that we produced in the collaboration .",
    "an analysis of this second version of the data shows that both vsa2f and vsa2 g present a deviation on @xmath19 , although in the case of the vsa2f pointing this deviation is smaller ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have also checked that these non - gaussianity detections are robust against the two different schemes for noise estimation .",
    "moreover , varying the noise estimates for the data within a @xmath26 does not change the results on the @xmath19 statistic .",
    "the previous tests suggest that the non - gaussian signal detected in the data via the @xmath19 statistic could be real , and not due to systematics .",
    "given that @xmath19 may indicate deviations on the second moment of the ( transformed ) visibilities , we have investigated the power spectrum of these two fields , as well as that of the vsa2efg mosaic .",
    "we have used for this computation @xmath27 bins instead of @xmath23 because the thermal noise in a single vsa field is high , so using small amount of visibilities could bias the estimation of the power .",
    "the @xmath27 bins were obtained by joining the sixteen bins from table  [ tab : bins ] in pairs , so one can easily relate the new bins with the old ones ( i.e. the new bin 1 corresponds to bins 1 and 2 from that table , and so on ) .    . ]    the power spectrum of the vsa2efg field is found to be compatible ( at the 1-sigma level ) with the one presented in @xcite , except in two bins which correspond with bins 9 & 10 , and 11 & 12 from table  [ tab : bins ] , and where we find a @xmath28-sigma and @xmath9-sigma deviation toward higher values , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig : ps_vsa2efg ] ) .",
    "although noisy , the power spectrum of the individual fields ( vsa2f and vsa2 g ) also show a deviation on those scales , being larger in the vsa2 g case ( practically @xmath29-sigma ) .",
    "the vsa2e field shows no deviations . a visual inspection of the vsa2 extended i mosaic ( see figure  3 in dickinson et al . 2004 )",
    "shows an intense positive feature close to the centre of the g pointing , which could be the responsible for that deviation .    in order to check",
    "if these fields are intrinsically gaussian , we have analysed the vsa2efg mosaic using now its own power spectrum . in this case , we find the value @xmath30 for @xmath17 , which is now compatible with gaussianity .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath19 excess found in this case is connected with a deviation of the power spectrum of the region with respect to the average one , and not with an intrinsic non - gaussianity ( in the sense that when we perform the analysis using their power spectrum , then they are gaussian ) .    to complete our study with the stgof ,",
    "we have investigated how significant is that deviation of the power spectrum of the region with respect to the average power spectrum .",
    "the probability of finding such a deviation in a multivariate gaussian field can be easily derived by noting that the @xmath27 bins used in the power spectrum computation are practically independent .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , we estimate that with the measured band powers and errors , the probability of having @xmath29 numbers out of @xmath27 such that one of them deviates @xmath28-sigma and the other one @xmath9-sigma is @xmath31 . if we now impose that these two values should be in adjacent bins ( as is our case ) , then this value reduces to @xmath32 .",
    "given that we have observed @xmath33 mosaics with similar characteristics ( although not completely independent , because mosaics 1 , 2 and 3 for different configurations partially overlap ) , then we conclude that this deviation of the power spectrum is not as significant as the one obtained using the @xmath19 statistic . in any case",
    ", both analyses suggest that we have detected a local deviation of the power spectrum ( i.e. an anisotropy ) in this vsa2 mosaic .",
    "an individual analysis of the three fields contained in the mosaic shows that vsa3f is compatible with gaussianity ( @xmath34 ) , while the vsa3e ( @xmath35 ) and vsa3 g ( @xmath36 ) present a deviation .",
    "we proceed as in the previous case , and we first split the two datasets ( vsa3e and vsa3 g ) into two separate parts corresponding to different observation epochs .",
    "we find that the non - gaussian signal connected with vsa3 g is only present in one part of the data , while the one corresponding to vsa3e is absent in both parts .",
    "this suggests that at least the non - gaussian signal found in vsa3 g with @xmath19 could be due to systematic effects , because is only present in one part of the data .",
    "next , we have examined the results using the two different noise estimation schemes .",
    "again , varying the noise estimates within @xmath37 does not change the results on @xmath19 .",
    "however , in this case we find a difference between the two methods for the vsa3e and vsa3 g pointings . when using a noise estimation based on the scatter of the visibilities when binning all daily observations , we find that now vsa3 g is compatible with gaussianity ( @xmath38 ) , and vsa3e shows a marginal deviation ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the non - gaussian signal found in this mosaic is in reality produced by residual systematic effects associated with a few visibility points which were left in the analysis .",
    "this is confirmed when using the other independent data reduction of these two pointings , where we find that both vsa3e and vsa3 g are compatible with gaussianity .",
    "the detailed analysis in separate bins permits us to isolate the origin of this signal , and exclude the affected visibilities . in both cases , it is connected with one single bin ( 5 and 11 , respectively ) .",
    "once these few visibilities are removed , all the individual pointings become compatible with gaussianity in the two versions of the data reduction , and the joint analysis of the three - fields mosaic gives @xmath40 .",
    "the previous analysis of the vsa data shows that the stgof tests are very sensitive methods to detect residual systematic effects in the data and/or deviations of the power spectrum from the average one . to further check the power of this method ,",
    "we have also applied it to the analysis of the data from a survey in the corona borealis supercluster region with the vsa @xcite .",
    "these data are known to present a strong deviation from gaussianity , associated to a negative decrement in the map which can not be explained in terms of primordial cmb fluctuations , or associated to a ( known ) cluster of galaxies in the region .",
    "a power spectrum analysis of these data presents a clear deviation with respect to the cosmological one in angular scales around @xmath5 , which corresponds to the angular size of that negative decrement .    here",
    ", we will complete the gaussianity studies described in @xcite by performing the simultaneous analysis of the data with the stgof .",
    "we have analysed the @xmath41 pointings which altogether make a mosaic of the central region of the supercluster .",
    "those pointings are noted with letters a , b , c , d , e , h , i , j and k. given the large size of the full covariance matrix for this dataset ( @xmath42 ) , only the lanczos method was applied . as shown above , for the signal - to - noise ratios achieved in the vsa observations , the lanczos method with @xmath43 , when applied to covariance matrices with @xmath44 ,",
    "gives the same values of the @xmath45 as those obtained with the full analysis if we restrict ourselves to @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath47 of the @xmath48 eigenvalues are good approximations to the true values ) . in the corona borealis case ,",
    "only @xmath49 eigenvalues are found to be above the cut @xmath17 , so the use of the lanczos algorithm is justified .    in the last row of table  [",
    "tab : results ] we present the results obtained with the arnoldi algorithm considering @xmath43 and @xmath17 .",
    "these numbers show a deviation of the @xmath19 statistic , as we would expect from the fact that the power spectrum of this mosaic differs from the average one .",
    "we now proceed as in the previous cases , and we first analyse all the individual pointings which participate in the mosaic . considered as a whole , each one of the @xmath41 pointings seem to be consistent with gaussianity , although the highest @xmath19 value is found for the h pointing ( @xmath50 ) which contains the main decrement near its centre . however",
    ", a detailed analysis in separate bins of all the nine datasets shows that the h pointing is the only one presenting a strong deviation for @xmath19 , and which is associated with the multipole region around @xmath5 , as we would expect .",
    "these results are stable when splitting the data in two separate parts , so the non - gaussianity seems to be intrinsic to the data .",
    "the results are also the same for the two noise estimation schemes .",
    "finally , we have re - analysed the whole corona - borealis mosaic using its own power spectrum , in order to probe if the detected non - gaussianity is only associated to the fact that we have a deviation of the power spectrum . in this case",
    ", we obtain that @xmath51 .",
    "this result is very interesting , because it is showing that in this case , the non - gaussianity found in the corona - borealis mosaic is intrinsic , and is not associated to a deviation of the power spectrum : even when we use the correct ( local ) power spectrum of the region in the analysis , the @xmath19 is still showing a detection of a non - gaussianity .",
    "we have analysed the full vsa data sets presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , using the smooth tests of goodness - of - fit adapted to interferometer experiments .",
    "this method was described in a05 , but here it has been extended to deal with large mosaics via the arnoldi method .",
    "this numerical method permits to solve large eigenvalue problems by reducing the dimensionality of the covariance matrix .",
    "we have shown that one implementation of this method for hermitian matrices , the lanczos algorithm , is able to provide good approximations to those eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the full covariance matrix with larger signal - to - noise ratio .    from our analysis of the vsa data dedicated to cosmological studies",
    ", we found that out of the @xmath33 mosaics presented in table  [ tab : results ] , eleven of them are consistent with gaussianity , and two of them show a deviation from gaussianity . in one case ( mosaic vsa3e + vsa3f + vsa3 g )",
    "the non - gaussian signal is shown to be produced by few visibility points which contain systematic effects that were not removed properly from the data .",
    "once this data are removed , the mosaic becomes compatible with gaussianity .    in the second case ( mosaic vsa2e + vsa2f + vsa2 g ) , we show that the method is detecting a local deviation of the power spectrum with respect to the average one .",
    "the stgof are very sensitive to the power spectrum adopted for the computation of the signal - to - noise eigenmodes , so small deviations from the correct power spectrum are easily detected in the analysis .",
    "this ability of the method could be used to study the isotropy of a given cmb map . moreover , when the data of this mosaic are analysed with their ( local ) power spectrum , then they are compatible with gaussianity ; but when we analyse the whole data set with the local power spectrum of the vsa2efg mosaic , then the rest of the mosaics become incompatible with gaussianity .",
    "these results could indicate the presence of anisotropy .",
    "however , there could be other possible explanations , such as the presence of residual foregrounds in this particular mosaic .",
    "nevertheless , there are no significant features seen in multi - frequency foregrounds maps ( @xmath52  mhz , h@xmath53 , 100  @xmath54 dust map ) that align with the main features of the vsa mosaic . moreover",
    ", this mosaic is one of the cleanest regions ( in terms of rms ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "regarding the case of point sources , we have investigated the possibility that this deviation could be produced by two unsubtracted sources with fluxes around @xmath55  mjy .",
    "note that a population of unresolved sources is not a possible explanation , because its contribution should scale as @xmath56 and it would produce deviations on smaller scales as well .",
    "however , two sources would produce structure as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "the value of @xmath55  mjy is an extrapolation to 33  ghz of the completeness limit of the ryle telescope survey at 15  ghz ( see @xcite , and also @xcite for the details of the survey ) .",
    "the @xmath58-sigma limit from ryle telescope at @xmath59  ghz is 10 mjy ; the worst case that we can have is a rising spectrum source with index of @xmath29 , so we considered the case of two @xmath55  mjy sources . using monte - carlo simulations to explore all the possible relative spatial distributions of the two sources , we find that we can not explain the measured value for @xmath19 in the vsa2 g .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that the vsa2f and vsa2 g fields are practically contained within the vsa2 mosaic obtained with the compact array .",
    "although those data were obtained with a different configuration , the scales where we find a deviation with the extended array were also sampled with the compact array ( but with poorer signal - to - noise ratio ) , so we could expect a small signature in the analysis . however , the value for vsa2 compact is @xmath60 , which is somewhat high but still compatible with gaussianity .",
    "we also note that the vsa2 and vsa3 fields were already analysed with other gaussianity tools in @xcite and @xcite , but no evidence of non - gaussian signals was found .",
    "this shows the importance of applying a wide number of gaussianity tests to the data , given that each particular test is sensitive to a different type of non - gaussianity .",
    "the fraction of data affected by the systematic effects in vsa3 extended i mosaic is too small to affect the published power spectrum by the vsa collaboration . a re - evaluation of the complete vsa power spectrum when we use the corrected version for these data shows no differences with the published values ( within the numerical precision of the maximum likelihood code ) .",
    "however , the deviation in the vsa2 extended i mosaic could influence these numbers .",
    "although there is no justified reason to exclude this vsa2 mosaic from the final computation , we have quantified the effect of excluding those data from the final analysis .",
    "thus , we have considered the extreme case in which we remove from the dataset all visibilities which lie inside one of the bins showing the non - gaussianity . with this new dataset",
    ", we have re - evaluated the complete power spectrum , and compared it to the one presented in @xcite in order to obtain the maximum deviations that we would expect .",
    "differences ( within the numerical precision of the power spectrum code ) are only found in three bins ( 10 , 11 & 12 ) , and are of the order of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 with respect to the published values . to complete this check",
    ", we have repeated the parameter estimation analysis described in @xcite , but now using this new power spectrum .",
    "we have considered two different models , corresponding to use vsa+wmap data on one hand , and vsa+cobe data on the other hand , and we have explored the 6-parameter flat @xmath64cdm model described in table  2 of @xcite .",
    "the differences in all parameters for the vsa+wmap case are found to be at the most 2% , so we can conclude that the cosmological analyses based on the published data are not affected .",
    "however , when using only the vsa+cobe data , we find only a significant difference in the estimate of the baryon density , which turns out to be @xmath65 at 68% c.l . , and which should be compared with the former value @xmath66 .",
    "this change can be easily understood , because the new power spectrum has less power in the region of the third acoustic peak , giving a smaller ( but compatible ) value of the baryon density .",
    "note that the new value is now closer to the bbn result , as well as to the result of the analysis using wmap+vsa .",
    "finally , we have applied the method to vsa observations of the corona borealis supercluster .",
    "these observations are known to present a deviation on the power spectrum produced by a strong decrement in one of the pointings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our method is able to detect this deviation , and it finds a large value for the @xmath19 statistic which can not be interpreted as systematic effects .",
    "a careful analysis shows that the non - gaussian signal is associated with the same scales where we find a deviation on the local power spectrum , and which correspond to the angular scale of the negative decrement .",
    "however , in this case the non - gaussian signal detected by the method is intrinsic to the data , in the sense that if we use the local power spectrum and we repeat the analysis , a non - gaussian detection is still present .",
    "we thank the staff of the mullard radio astronomy observatory , the jodrell bank observatory and the teide observatory for invaluable assistance in the commissioning and operation of the vsa .",
    "the vsa is supported by pparc and the iac .",
    "partial finantial support was provided by the spanish ministry of science and technology project aya2001 - 1657 .",
    "we also acknowledge the spanish project esp2004 - 07067-c03 - 01 ."
