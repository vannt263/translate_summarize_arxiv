    "the issue of accretion as the power source behind active galactic nuclei ( agns ) was decided as early as 1969 @xcite . since then , a 40-year effort to unravel the physics underlying this process has produced a great body of observational and theoretical work covering a host of the agn properties and phenomena . however , due to the small angular size of a black hole horizon , whether at the galactic or extragalactic setting , these studies were effectively performed mainly in the spectral ( but also the time ) domain ; the spatial structure of accretion flows , but those of scale of many parsecs , was then inevitably delegated to models , whose validity was determined by their ability to reproduce the spectral and timing observations with sufficient accuracy . at the risk of oversimplifying the issue , the spectral properties of agns were basically outlined ( among other works ) in @xcite who showed that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agns includes three broad components in the ir , optical - uv and x - ray bands , with roughly equal energy per decade , with the radio comprising only a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity , of order @xmath12 in the radio - quiet ( rq ) agns and @xmath13 in radio - loud ( rl ) agns .    considering that accretion produces most of its power in the last 10 or so schwarzschild radii , @xmath14 , outside the black hole horizon , barring an inherently non - thermal emission process ( as it turns out to be the case with blazars ) ,",
    "it is strange that the observed seds exhibit roughly constant luminosity per decade .",
    "interestingly , the simplest of assumptions , namely radiation of the agn bolometric luminosity in black body form by an object ( most likely in the form of a cold disk of @xmath15 k ) of size a few @xmath14 of a supermassive black hole ( @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the solar mass ) , implies peak emission at uv frequencies , consistent with the observationally identified uv feature referred to above , known as the big blue bump ( bbb ) ; as such , this feature was modeled with emission by a geometrically - thin , optically - thick accretion disk extending usually to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the black hole . of the other two distinct components",
    "the x - rays are generally attributed to emission by an optically - thin , hot ( @xmath18 k ) corona overlying this disk and heated by the action of magnetic fields that thread the geometrically - thin disk , in close analogy to the solar corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the ir emission was accounted for as the result of reprocessing the o - uv radiation by a geometrically thick ( scale height @xmath19 roughly equal to the local radius @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath20 ) , cool , molecular torus at large distances ( @xmath21 pc ) from the central engine [ an arrangement that presents a bit of a problem , since the temperature of this torus ( @xmath22 k ) is much less than the virial temperature of the gas at that distance and would lead to a configuration with @xmath23 ; see krolik & begelman  ( 1988 ) .",
    "the region between the torus and the accretion disk was thought to be occupied by clouds with velocity widths ranging from tens of thousands to several hundreds of kilometers per second , producing the observed line radiation , with the ensemble of these components encapsulated in the well known cartoon of @xcite .",
    "while in most models these components are generally thought of as independent , principal component analysis ( pca ) of multiwavelength agn features by @xcite and @xcite indicated that most of the variance in the measured optical emission line properties and a broad range of continuum features ( radio , optical , x - ray ) of agns was contained in two sets of correlations , eigenvectors of the correlation matrix .",
    "this analysis suggested that the properties of these features are not independent ( despite their diverse locations and emission processes ) but are well correlated by two single underlying physical parameters through the physics of accretion and the conversion of its power to radiation and outflows . on the other hand , general theoretical arguments suggesting , e.g. a tight correlation between variations in the x - ray and o - uv components , given their implied proximity , were not confirmed by observations @xcite .    the advent of x - ray instrumentation and in particular x - ray spectroscopy , established the presence of spectral components apparently present across the entire range of compact object masses from galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) to luminous agns , namely outflowing x - ray absorbing matter in our line of sight ( los ) manifested as complex ( blueshifted ) absorption features of hydrogen equivalent column density @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the presence of this absorbing material , often referred to as warm absorber , was first established in _ asca _ observations of many agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gbhcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which provided clear evidence of highly ionized oxygen  ( 0.739 kev ) and/or  ( 0.871 kev ) along the los .",
    "more recently , grating spectra of high - resolving power obtained by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have enabled the study of these absorption features in greater detail leading to the conclusion that they are present in a large fraction of agns and span a wide range ( @xmath26 ) in ionization parameter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hbk07 ) .",
    "some sources appear to contain low and/or high velocity outflows ( e.g. hbk07 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while a handful of objects exhibit a trans - relativistic outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition in both agns and gbhcs the observed outflows from at least a number of sources have been suggested to be accelerated magnetically ( rather than by another process ) off an accretion disk ( e.g. , see miller et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 for gro  j1655 - 40 ; kraemer et al .",
    "2005 and crenshaw & kraemer  2007 for ngc  4151 ) .",
    "a brief review of luminous agn winds is found in @xcite .",
    "these facts imply the presence of gas covering a large fraction of the solid angle and distributed over a large range of radii , perhaps the entire range between the x - ray source and the torus , indicating agns to be multiscale and multiwavelength objects rather than a class with properties determined only by the power released by accretion in the black hole vicinity .",
    "this last point has gained further support with the discovery of the correlation between the accreting black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of the surrounding stellar population @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , most early agn treatments were focused on the structure of the innermost regions of the accretion flow and as such they limited themselves to the study of the conditions in a rather narrow range of radii . nonetheless , several treatments of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) accretion disk winds , aiming to account for the observed agn outflows , employed self - similar solutions , which naturally span a large range in radius ( e.g. blandford & payne 1982 , hereafter bp82 ; contopoulos & lovelace 1994 , hereafter cl94 ) . using the structure of these solutions , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kk94 ) proposed that the so - called molecular torus of the agn unification scheme is a dynamical rather than a static object , namely an mhd wind of the type suggested in the above works .",
    "kk94 also contented that agreement between model and observation demanded a rather specific type of wind , a particular case of those discussed in cl94 , one that we also concentrate on in the present work . at the same time",
    ", they noted that the 2d geometry of these winds ( with low column at inclination angles @xmath27 , i.e. along the wind axis , and high column at @xmath28 ) provided , in addition , a natural framework for the unification scheme of type i and ii seyfert galaxies proposed by antonucci & miller  ( 1985 ) , thereby linking the large scale agn spectral classification to the dynamics of agn accretion / outflows .",
    "self - similar solutions of the accretion flow equations were also provided by @xcite , who considered the structure of hot accretion flows in the regime of low accretion rate , i.e. for accretion rates less than the eddington value , @xmath29 .",
    "because for these low rates the accretion time scale @xmath30 is shorter than the gas cooling time @xmath31 , in fact @xmath32 , only a fraction @xmath11 of the energy released in the dissipation of the plasma kinetic energy is radiated away with the remainder advected into the black hole ( hence the term advection dominated accretion flows or adafs ) ; as a result , the accretion luminosity is then proportional to @xmath33 ( rather than @xmath34 ) .",
    "the high temperature of the inner adafs , provides naturally for the hot component required to produce the observed x - ray emission , which , rather than being an independent component , within adafs is incorporated in the dynamics of accretion itself ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent review ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite , elaborated further on adafs elucidating , among others , the reason for which the bernoulli integral of adafs is positive ( a point that had been noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that being that the viscous stresses transfer outward , in addition to angular momentum , also mechanical energy .",
    "they then proposed that this excess energy can be carried away in the form of wind over a large range of radii , thereby leading to configurations similar to those obtained in the more detailed studies of bp82 and cl94 , while at the same time maintaining some of the general properties of adafs .",
    "the combination of radiatively inefficient flows with the simultaneous presence of winds led to the nomenclature advection dominated inflow - outflow solutions ( adios ) . following these pioneering works ,",
    "many attempts have been made in recent years to reproduce and explain the kinematics and x - ray spectra of the observed outflows in agns ( see , among others , * ? ? ?",

    "motivated by these considerations we are taking a closer look at the issue of warm absorbers ( x - ray absorbing medium ) in terms of specific disk - wind models , namely those of cl94 . as it will be discussed in more detail later on ,",
    "these solutions are characterized by a parameter @xmath35 , which determines the distribution of axial current in the wind as a function of the radius ; this parameter , in conjunction with the mhd conservation laws and the radial force balance , determines both the radial dependence of the matter density in the wind and the radial dependence of the toroidal magnetic field component @xmath36 .",
    "taking our lead from the works of @xcite and hbk07 , in the present work we restrict our attention to wind models with @xmath37 , i.e. the value used also by kk94 .",
    "this is in a sense a critical value of this parameter because , as discussed in cl94 , it leads to winds with toroidal magnetic field @xmath38 and therefore magnetic field energy on the disk that diverges only logarithmically at small and large @xmath1 and as such it can be considered as a  minimum magnetic energy \" configuration ( kk94 ) ; values of @xmath39 lead to configurations with power - law divergence either at small or large @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the choice @xmath37 leads to a wind with radial density profile @xmath41 , i.e. a profile with equal column per logarithmic radial interval ( and normalization that depends on the polar angle @xmath3 and the mass - accretion rate @xmath11 ) , a fact that is in general agreement with the profiles implied by the ionized absorbers data analysis to date ( hbk07 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar density profile was invoked by @xcite and @xcite to explain the fourier frequency dependence of the soft - hard x - ray lags observed in gbhcs and in agns ( papadakis et al .",
    "2002 ) .    with the wind 2d ( @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) density field as a function of radius and angle provided by the models of cl94 ( i.e. ignoring at present effects that can be attributed to other agents that could affect the wind structure ) and the assumption of a point x - ray source of a given spectrum at the origin",
    ", one can compute their 2d ionization structure and in particular the local column density of specific ionic species as a function of radius and angle .",
    "one can also compute the integrated column of each such ion , quantities that can be directly compared to observation ( hbk07 ) .",
    "this we do in the present work .",
    "while a number of issues remain open or are sidestepped in the present self - similar wind models , this is the price to pay in order to limit the number of free parameters to just two ( the wind mass flux and the observer inclination angle ) , a fact that allows the study of the properties of warm absorbers within the global perspective of agn unification .    our paper is structured as follows : in  2 we review the mhd wind equations and structure as given in cl94 and make a connection of these winds with flows of the adaf / adios type by relating the wind density normalization to the ionizing luminosity produced by the idealized point source at the coordinate origin . in ",
    "3 we provide the general 2d ionization structure , the local column of specific ions as a function of radius as well as the total ionic column of a given charge state and for each element , as well as the absorption line profiles of selected transitions . in ",
    "4 the results are compared to observation , the properties and limitation of the present treatment are discussed and a course for future work is charted .",
    "our wind model consists primarily of two parts : ( @xmath42 ) the outflow / wind structure originating from a geometrically - thin accretion disk as described by cl94 and ( @xmath43 ) the computation of the ionization of the wind plasma under local heating - cooling and ionization equilibrium , by employing the photoinization code ` xstar ` @xcite .",
    "these two steps are self - consistently coupled in a scheme similar to some previous work in a slightly different context ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all calculations are performed under steady - state , axisymmetric conditions as shall be described in detail in the following sections .",
    "while the detailed formalism of self - similar mhd wind solutions is found in cl94 , let us here briefly summarize some of their characteristics .",
    "the basic equations of this problem are those of steady - state , nonrelativistic , ideal mhd that include gravity and gas pressure , namely @xmath44 here , the plasma wind velocity @xmath45 is assumed to be frozen into the global magnetic field @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the electric field ; @xmath48 is the electric current density ; and @xmath49 is the speed of light . the gas pressure @xmath50 and mass density @xmath51 of the wind are related through an equation of state @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the adiabatic constant and adiabatic index respectively .",
    "the assumption of axial symmetry allows one to separate poloidal quantities from toroidal ones as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 where , @xmath58 is the magnetic flux function .",
    "we will henceforth work in spherical coordinates ( @xmath59 ) [ note that cl94 used cylindrical ones ( @xmath60 ) ] .",
    "magnetic field lines lie along surfaces of constant value of @xmath61 . furthermore , under conditions of steady - state , the following quantities are conserved along field lines characterized by the value of @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ratio of mass to magnetic fluxes , @xmath68 is the angular velocity of magnetic field lines , @xmath69 corresponds to the specific angular momentum ( it includes magnetic torques ) , @xmath70 is the specific energy ( bernoulli ) integral , and @xmath71 is the specific entropy . also ,",
    "@xmath72 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath73 is the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "the wind velocity field @xmath45 is related to the magnetic field @xmath46 as @xmath74 cl94 first showed that one can obtain general self - similar solutions of the above system of equations of the form @xmath75 here , @xmath76 is the launch radius of a characteristic field / flow line at the base of the wind at @xmath77 while @xmath78 and @xmath79 are respectively the magnitude of the vertical components of the magnetic field and the initial rotational wind velocity at the same foot point ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 are dimensionless with @xmath82 while @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the angular dependence of the pressure and wind density , respectively .",
    "the exponent @xmath35 is a free parameter that controls the radial scaling of the magnetic field .",
    "one sees directly that @xmath35 discriminates current - carrying wind configurations ( when @xmath85 , @xmath86 grows with @xmath1 ; the wind carries a net axial current ) from zero - total - current ones ( when @xmath87 , @xmath88 for @xmath89 ; the wind carries a singular axial current and its corresponding return current ; see cl94 and references ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is dimensionless , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the poloidal magnetic flux through radius @xmath76 .",
    "the above scalings allow us to obtain the geometry of the poloidal field / flow lines ( characterized by the value of @xmath61 ) as @xmath94 note that the function @xmath91 characterizes the shape of all field / flow lines .",
    "that is , all field / flow lines are self - similar to the ` characteristic ' field / flow line that originates at @xmath95 and @xmath96 on the disk .",

    "\\label{eq : sound}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , one can combine the dimensionless forms of equations  ( [ eq : f])-([eq : entropy ] ) that involve the dimensionless quantities @xmath101 as functions of @xmath3 , and thus express the poloidal projection of the momentum balance equation  ( [ eq : mhd-5 ] ) [ the so called generalized grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation ] in the form of a second - order ordinary differential equation for @xmath91 as @xmath102 this equation ( too complicated to write down explicitly in this paper ) is integrated numerically from the surface of the disk ( taken for simplicity to lie at @xmath77 ) to axial infinity ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , essentially a free - parameter that depends on the details of the internal disk structure , which , for a given value of @xmath106 , is adjusted in order for the wind to cross the alfv@xmath107n  point ( the point at which the the wind poloidal speed @xmath108 becomes equal to the local alfv@xmath107n  speed - see cl94 for a detailed description ) continuously and smoothly . according to equation  ( [ eq : geom ] ) , the form of the solution @xmath91 characterizes the poloidal shape of the field lines , and in particular , the initial condition @xmath109 characterizes the angle the poloidal field / flow lines make with the disk at their foot points [ readers can easily verify that this angle is equal to @xmath110 .    to numerically solve the above wind equation  ( [ eq : gs ] ) we assume that the plasma is initially in keplerian rotation @xmath111 at the disk surface @xmath112 with only a small out - of - the - disk velocity component ( @xmath113 at @xmath114 ) . as a fiducial solution we fix the following set of parameters as described in cl94 ; @xmath37 , @xmath115 with kinematic variables @xmath116 ,",

    "the only freedom left is the value of @xmath109 that is obtained iteratively so that the wind passes smoothly through the alfv@xmath107n  surface .",
    "this important physical constraint yields @xmath122 . note that for sufficiently small @xmath123 ( a magnetically dominated flow ) its velocity is nearly keplerian , setting the value of @xmath124 , while passing through the alfvn point fixes @xmath106 and effectively the remaining constants of the flow , with @xmath35 as the one meaningful free parameter .",
    "the obtained wind kinematics are shown in figure  [ fig : wind]a and the magnetic field components in figure  [ fig : wind]b .",
    "as discussed in cl94 , different values of the exponent @xmath35 allow for distinct streamline geometries in the poloidal plane , which in turn is associated with other observable quantities of the wind ( such as the density profile ; see following sections ) .",
    "as is initially set up , this wind is launched from a thin keplerian disk with only a small out - of - the - disk surface velocity component .",
    "the magnetic field there is dragged by the rotating plasma ( @xmath125 ) resulting thus in a negative toroidal field component ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "as the wind leaves the disk , magnetic torques act on the outflowing plasma and magnetic energy is efficiently converted into kinetic energy of the wind along the symmetry axis .",
    "the magnetic field also plays an important role in collimating the wind at large distances . in this particular case",
    "the wind is found to end up with terminal velocity roughly a few times the initial rotational speed and remains below fast magnetosonic speed .",
    "the astute reader may note that x - ray heating is likely to produce thermal velocities inconsistent with the self - similarity of the sound speed invoked above ( i.e. @xmath127 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : amd ] ) .",
    "we will discuss this in  3.1 .",
    "knowing the wind streamline described by equation  ( [ eq : gs ] ) one can separately write down radial and angular dependence of the wind number density @xmath128 as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the number density normalization at the initial characteristic launching radius @xmath76 , @xmath131 is the normalized angular dependence of the wind number density , and @xmath132 is the non - dimensional radial coordinate ; @xmath133 is the proton mass and @xmath134 the mean molecular weight of the wind . in what follows",
    ", we will take the characteristic radius to be equal to the schwarzschild radius , namely @xmath135 , taken to be the inner edge of the accretion flow with @xmath136 cm where @xmath137 is the mass of the black hole in units of solar mass @xmath17 .",
    "it is well known that free - fall spherical accretion at the eddington rate ( @xmath138 ) produces thomson opacity one ( @xmath139 ) at the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath140 ) . using this scaling",
    "we can express our wind density normalization at the inner edge of the disk as @xmath141 where , @xmath142 is the ratio of of the mass - outflow rate in the wind to the mass - accretion rate @xmath143 , assumed here to be @xmath144 , and @xmath145 is the thomson cross - section . it is important to note here that because the mass flux in these winds depends in general on the radius , a normalized parameter used throughout this work , @xmath11 , always refers to the mass flux at the innermost value of the flow radius , i.e. at @xmath146 .",
    "figure  [ fig : density]a exhibits a los angle ( @xmath3 ) dependence of the wind density profile @xmath147 from the pole ( @xmath148 ) to the equator ( @xmath149 ) along a characteristic stream line of @xmath150 , normalized to unity at its highest value at @xmath151 , as obtained from the self - similar solution of figure  [ fig : wind ] .",

    "we employ the photoionization code ` xstar ` version 2.1kn9 , which solves simultaneously for the ionization balance and thermal equilibrium of the locally illuminated wind .",
    "the implementation of the above code involves a number of issues and leads to certain wind observables , amongst which are the following : ( @xmath42 ) the ionization is locally determined by the photon flux per electron flux ; a proxy for that is the ionization parameter @xmath170 , with @xmath171 being the luminosity of the ionizing source ; ( @xmath43 ) the computation of the ionizing flux requires the transfer of radiation from the source through the los wind , given that part of it can be removed by scattering and absorption ; ( @xmath172 ) given that our wind models produce , in addition to the density @xmath128 , also the wind velocity field @xmath173 we are then able to compute also detailed absorption line profiles ; ( @xmath174 ) the broad range of the wind density with radius leads to ions with very diverse ionization states , whose distribution per logarithmic @xmath2 interval , the amd , discussed in hbk07 and @xcite , can be used to determine the wind radial profile .",
    "we will discuss each one of these issues in detail below .      with the density profile at hand , the wind ionization structure ,",
    "i.e. the local value of @xmath2 , requires also an expression for the x - ray luminosity .",
    "since the models we present are global , i.e. they cover a large number of decades in radius , it makes more sense that we do not detach the ionizing luminosity from the global wind dynamics . in order to do",
    "so we need a prescription that connects the wind mass flux rate @xmath175 and the ionizing luminosity @xmath171 .",

    "there are several points to note about equation  ( [ eq : xi1 ] ) and figure  [ fig:2d]b : ( @xmath42 ) if distances are scaled by the schwarzschild radius , @xmath14 , and the accretion rate by its eddington value , @xmath202 , the ionization parameter , @xmath203 , depends primarily on the normalized accretion rate @xmath11 and @xmath204 ; as a result , our analysis and the corresponding ionization structure of the wind , are applicable to accreting black holes of any size .",
    "note that , had one assumed @xmath182 , the expression for @xmath2 would be independent even of @xmath11 ; we believe that this would be in disagreement with observation ; @xmath205 the ionization parameter @xmath2 is much higher near the central engine ( e.g. within a few hundreds to thousands radii ) with the wind highly ionized in this region and for a given @xmath1 it drops precipitously with @xmath3 ; @xmath206 for a given @xmath3 , the value of @xmath2 drops with distance ( with @xmath207 for our favorite value of @xmath208 ) ; ( @xmath174 ) @xmath2 increases linearly with increasing accretion rate @xmath11 , implying decreasing source obscuration for high values of @xmath11 as seen in equation  ( [ eq : column1 ] ) , in agreement with observation @xcite ; ( @xmath209 ) the wind is fully ionized in regions sufficiently close to the central engine thus no contribution to the absorption lines in the spectrum .",
    "one should note that , as written , the expression of equation   ( [ eq : xi1 ] ) is a local one , i.e. it does not take into account neither the absorption of the x - ray radiation in its propagation along the los wind nor the corresponding re - emission , both of which would modify the local ionizing spectrum , and thus also the global ionization structure shown in figure  [ fig:2d]b here .",
    "these effects are small at small values of the radius ( @xmath210 and for relatively hard spectra @xmath211 ) , where the ionization of the gas is high and its absorption depth small at all energies ; they become more significant at larger radii and they are taken into detailed consideration in our model calculations as discussed below .",
    "it should also be cautioned at this point , that while @xmath212 is the primary parameter that determines the ionization state of the x - ray illuminated gas , the latter depends also on the spectrum of the incident radiation , as the resulting electron temperature is roughly equal to the mean photon energy of the ionizing radiation . in the calculations presented",
    "herein we assume a single power - law with an energy spectrum @xmath213 between 13.6 ev and 13.6 kev and @xmath214 as a fiducial model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more realistic incident spectral distributions ( those used , e.g. , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) can be easily accommodated within ` xstar ` likely leading to results that are not substantially different from those of the next sections , although we defer such studies to future publications .      as noted above",
    ", equation  ( [ eq : xi1 ] ) is strictly valid when the attenuation of the radiation field by the wind itself is small ; it is used in the computation of the ionization state only for the innermost , highly ionized regions of the wind , while at larger radii we use the absorbed radiation field is employing ` xstar ` for the computation of the relevant opacities ; the method is described below and it is very similar to the recent work of , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since at present we are interested mainly in the absorption properties of the above configuration , whose thomson opacity is generally small , we treat the gas along the los independently as a collection of radially discrete slabs of constant ( local ) density , and the total column depends only on the los angle @xmath3 in accordance with figure  [ fig : density]a . at large distances where the value of the ionization parameter drops and he and h opacities become important , we let ` xstar ` subdivide each zone as necessary for the proper treatment of the radiative transfer ; since in this case the absorption mean - free path at the characteristic frequencies is much smaller than the local radius , the plane parallel geometry employed by ` xstar ` for this purpose is adequate .    with the ionizing luminosity @xmath171 and a spectrum specified at @xmath215 , the entire los wind with the radial length scale of @xmath216",
    "is divided up into a number of ( plane parallel ) slabs / zones ( typically @xmath217 ) of logarithmically - equal thickness in radius ; i.e. @xmath218 .",
    "then , using ` xstar ` we calculate the absorption and emission coefficients within , say , the @xmath219-th zone , using as input the ( properly normalized ) output spectrum of the @xmath42-th zone , @xmath220 .",
    "we thus obtain the forwardly emitted spectrum in emission lines @xmath221 and in continuum @xmath222 by computing the free - free , free - bound and bound - bound atomic transitions within the @xmath219-th zone ( see ` xstar ` manual ) , while we ignore for this calculation the part of the backward directed flux .",
    "we also compute the fraction of the radiation flux of the @xmath42-th zone , @xmath220 , that is transmitted through the @xmath219-th zone , @xmath223 , given by @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the optical depth ( including continuum and line photoabsorption as well as thomson scattering ) of the @xmath219-th zone , with @xmath226 being the total hydrogen equivalent column of this slab .",
    "finally , we produce the ( properly normalized ) spectrum of the @xmath219-th zone , by adding the forwardly emitted and transmitted spectra , i.e. @xmath227 with the process being iterated with @xmath228 in place of @xmath220 , to compute @xmath229 and so on .",
    "the above procedure can be applied to a specific atomic transition to produce the resulting line profile and an absorption feature since this is the dominant process along the observer s los to the point - like ionizing source .",
    "the corresponding emission is distributed isotropically and makes a negligible contribution to specific intensity at the particular frequency .",
    "the radiation transfer of a specific feature is dominated by the optical depth of the wind at the specific frequency @xmath230 , which is expressed by @xmath231 with the line photoabsorption cross - section @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the oscillator strength of the transition between the @xmath234th and @xmath235th levels of an ionic species and @xmath236 is the doppler broadening factor estimated by @xmath237 relative to the centroid ( rest - frame ) frequency @xmath238 with @xmath239 being either thermal or turbulent velocity of the medium , assuming that the overall absorption profiles are well approximated locally by the voigt function @xmath240 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "irrespective of their thermal or turbulent velocities , the winds we consider provide a well defined velocity shear between two adjacent slabs , whose effect on the radiative transfer of a line photon is very similar to that of the turbulent velocity .",
    "to rid the situation of as much unwanted uncertainty as possible we then consider the thermal and turbulent broadenings to be negligible and we consider only the shear broadening , so that @xmath244 with @xmath245 being the los velocity shear .",

    "then the hydrogen equivalent column of specific ions , @xmath158 , as a function of @xmath2 can be used to determine the wind density distribution as a function of radius .",

    "in this section we discuss in detail the implementation of the procedures described above and the ensuing results concerning the properties of individual atomic transitions as well as their dependence on the parameters of the problem .",
    "in particular we focus on specific ionic charge states that are important in that they can serve as spectroscopic diagnostics of the ionization state of the wind medium . because of the specific , continuous decrease of the mhd wind density inherent to the accretion - origin wind scenario , our models span a wide range of ionization parameter space and hence a large number of the corresponding atomic transitions ( in absorption ) .",
    "their global properties are encapsulated in the amd , namely the distribution of ( locally ) absorbing column per logarithmic ionization parameter interval , a quantity originally introduced by hbk07 , which can and has been compiled for a number of agns using comprehensive fits to the ensemble of absorption features in their entire x - ray spectrum @xcite . furthermore , given that to each ionization state of the plasma corresponds also a specific wind velocity , there exists a correlation between the presence of a specific atomic transition and the corresponding plasma velocity . employing this generic property",

    "in this work we have presented a detailed study of the ionization structure of model mhd winds off accretion disks ; this is our first attempt to model within this context the recent observations of absorption features in the _ asca , xmm _ and _ chandra _ x - ray spectra , the so - called warm absorbers . to this end",
    "we have employed the self - similar 2d hydromagnetic wind models developed by cl94 that provide the fluid 2d density and velocity fields , which we coupled to photoionization calculations using ` xstar ` .",
    "our consideration of magnetocentrifugal ( mhd ) winds / outflows in this work has been motivated and supported in part by recent observational implications that at least in a number of agns and gbhcs the inferred driving mechanism of the observed x - ray ionized wind medium is magnetic rather than thermal or radiative ( e.g. , see miller et al .  2006 , 2008 for gro  j1655 - 40 ; kraemer et al .",
    "2005 and crenshaw & kraemer  2007 for ngc  4151 ) . given the scope of our paper , our model wind is necessarily overly simple .",
    "it ignores a host of issues that affect the structure of winds off accretion disks and replaces them with the self - similar models of cl94 .",
    "the interested reader can get a feeling of the multitude and complexity of the issues not addressed in the present treatment by looking at the works of , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ( and references therein ) and also ( * ? ? ? * for disks with several distinct values of the accretion rate @xmath290 ) .",
    "these include , among others , the radiative transfer in the wind , the ensuing effects of radiation pressure and also the influence of the vertical gradient of @xmath291 in the launching of the wind .",
    "as shown in these references the winds can be radiation driven in the inner part of the disk ( due to the increased flux at this spatial domain ) while being magnetically launched at larger radii . in this respect our model winds are quite different in structure and variability from the more realistic winds of @xcite at small radii , while they should be more similar to those of his at larger radii where radiation pressure is smaller and the wind is magnetically launched .",
    "realistic models must by necessity consider the transition of the underlying disk from radiation pressure , at small @xmath1 , to gas pressure dominance at larger radii ; this fact would likely force a different choice of our boundary condition @xmath292 and therefore yield a field geometry that breaks the self - similarity of our solutions .",
    "wind models very similar to those used herein but with the inclusion of the effects of the radiation pressure that break the self - similarity were discussed by kk94 and @xcite .",
    "one should therefore view our models with the above caveats in mind .",
    "the significance and assumptions of the models we propose is basically justified _ a posteriori _ by their ability to interpret the observations .",
    "self - similarity is one of the fundamental assumptions of our model winds .",
    "however , whether exactly self - similar or not , any model that would attempt to account the entire range of ionic species shown e.g. in @xcite must by necessity cover a very broad range in the photoionization parameter @xmath2 .",
    "then , the column of each such ion provides a measure of the corresponding hydrogen equivalent column @xmath158 as a function of @xmath2 , i.e. the amd .",
    "these two quantities ( @xmath293 ) can then be employed to provide a measure of the gas density @xmath294 as a function of the distance @xmath1 from the x - ray source . barring the possibility of several independent regions at different distances but similar columns as indicated by the functional form of the amd",
    "( one could consider this is possibility at the risk of introducing an inordinate number of free parameters ) , models with radial density profiles as those considered here are a natural consequence of the amd obtained by the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the wind ionization structure was followed in 1d as described in  2.2 , namely along the observer s los , assuming the ionizing source to be point - like .",
    "clearly , a more comprehensive treatment of this problem should take into account also the backward emitted radiation which will reach the observer from the regions of the disk on the other side of the black hole , as well as the scattered radiation , whose effects could be significant .",
    "we plan to return to these issues in a future publication .",
    "the 2d structure of the winds considered in our analysis implies , at a minimum , a two - parameter description of the absorption features .",
    "however , the self - similarity of the problem simplifies further the treatment by allowing the separation of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 variables with the wind density obtaining the form @xmath295 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is a most important parameter of these models because it determines both the radial dependence of the ionization parameter @xmath2 and the wind column density per decade of radius along a given direction ( los ) . in the models examined in the present work we restricted our study to the value @xmath37 , which leads to a radial density profile @xmath296",
    "this is an interesting profile in that it provides for an ionization parameter @xmath2 with a similar dependence , i.e. @xmath297 , and most importantly , with equal column per decade in radius , across the entire range in radius and the corresponding range in @xmath2 ; as a result , ionic species of very different ionization properties , existing over a wide range of ionization parameter ( and radius ) , have roughly comparable column densities , independent of the distance and are therefore possible to detect . as noted in cl94 , the value of @xmath35 determines also the axial current distribution in radius within the wind , with the corresponding magnetic energy per unit length at the wind base being also constant per ( cylindrical ) decade in radius .",
    "it is worth comparing our work with that of kk94 , who used the same type of mhd wind with the value of @xmath35 as we do herein : while these authors focused their study on the effects of dust on radiation transfer , we focus our attention on the effects of the ionizing radiation on the x - ray spectra of agns , in particular on the ionized absorbers .",
    "kk94 also noted in passing the relevance of their models to the x - ray agn spectra well ahead of the detailed outflow observations made with _",
    "chandra_.    while the structure of the wind in @xmath1 and @xmath3 is provided by the models of cl94 , for the remaining parameters of our models , namely the normalization of the wind density and the x - ray luminosity of the ionizing source we have chosen to use the scalings of adafs , or better adios ; as a result the x - ray luminosity is proportional to the square of the ( normalized ) accretion rate at the inner edge of the disk @xmath33 rather than simply @xmath11 , assumed in standard accretion disks .",
    "therefore , restricting ourselves to models with @xmath37 , the global ionization structure of a given wind , including the normalization of the column density , depends only on _ two parameters _ , namely @xmath11 and the observer s inclination angle @xmath3 .",
    "this parametrization provides an extremely economical set of assumptions concerning not only the outflows , i.e. the wind ionization structure seen in absorption in detailed x - ray spectra , but also for the entire ( radio - quiet ) agn unification picture : figure [ fig : density ] which exhibits the normalization of the wind density as a function of @xmath3 along the magnetic field line of @xmath298 , makes apparent the difference in column between face - on and edge - on views , implying that the wind , if extending to sufficiently large radii , can in fact serve as the proposed molecular torus associated with agn unification , a point originally made by kk94 , also for winds with @xmath37 ; it is of interest to note that the few objects for which sufficiently detailed observations exit are consistent values @xmath299 ( hbk07 ; * ? ? ?",
    "within this same context and ionizing luminosity considerations , one should note the dependence of source obscuration on the x - ray luminosity , namely its reduced value for objects accreting at a higher fraction of their eddington rate @xmath11 , which apparently is in general agreement with observations .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these notions can withstand the scrutiny of more consistent and encompassing observational tests .",
    "at this point we would like to stress the importance of the amd in the study of agn outflows / winds , a quantity enunciated by hbk07 and modeled in detail in the preceding sections .",
    "analyses similar to those of hbk07 and @xcite are indispensable because they produce a consistent analysis of the entire set of absorption features in the agn x - ray absorption spectra . at the same time",
    "they underscore the unique value of x - ray spectroscopy which , in a wavelength band of @xmath300 decades , can encapsulate the properties of ions that span @xmath301 orders of magnitude in ionization parameter and , for models with @xmath299 , a similar range in radius ; at the same time , measurement of their absorption columns yields the equivalent hydrogen column of the flow , @xmath158 , over a similar range in radius , thereby going a long way toward the determination of the physics underlying the outflow dynamics .",
    "the fact that the amd analyses to date are roughly independent of @xmath2 provide support to our use of the @xmath37 or @xmath302 models , reiterating that a similar density profile was invoked on the basis of agn and gbhc timing properties @xcite .",
    "we have thus presented a concrete example of the amd dependence on @xmath2 for our @xmath37 models with @xmath303 and two different values of the observer s inclination angle ( see table  [ tab : tbl-1 ] for details ) .",
    "as expected we found the amd to be constant , i.e. independent of @xmath2 , over many decades in this parameter ( i.e. the local column density @xmath280 is independent of ionization states @xmath2 of ions ) . with @xmath304 ,",

    "* ) and also some other agns detailed below .",
    "one should note that these values depend primarily on @xmath11 and @xmath3 and are independent of the black hole mass .",
    "the mass of the object gets involved only as a measure of its total luminosity , which does not appear in the expression for @xmath158 , implying that these models could in principle be applicable also in gbhcs .",
    "high quality x - ray absorption data are in fact available for the gbhc gro  j1655 - 40 and were used to argue for magnetic driving of the wind in this system too @xcite .",
    "these spectra are distinguished from those of agns by the prominent absence of low ionization state ions .",
    "this is to be expected given that the presence of the companion star limits the extent of the disk to roughly half the distance between the two objects or @xmath310 cm .",
    "given that the schwarzschild radius of the compact object is @xmath311 cm the entire disk size covers only a range of @xmath312 in radius ; considering ( based on fig .  [ fig : amd ] ) that in the inner region of the wind ( @xmath313 cm ) major elements ( even heavier species ) are almost fully ionized , one would expect the presence of ions over only a factor of 1000 in @xmath2 , in rough agreement with the observation .",
    "given that our models provide also the complete velocity field of the mhd wind we have also produced a sequence of synthetic absorption profiles as described in  2.2 and shown in  3.2 .",
    "we have done so for two charge levels of fe , namely   and . with our fiducial model predicting the   column to be maximum at @xmath314 erg  cm  s@xmath7",

    "fig : fe ] ) to be @xmath315 km  s@xmath7 in excellent agreement with the observed values of iras  13349 + 2438 .",
    "it is important to note that the model produces not only the correct velocity @xmath153 at the maximum value of @xmath316 but also the observed @xmath317 normalization _ for the same inclination angle_. it is therefore possible with measurements of the combined line widths and column densities to reproduce within the present models both @xmath35 , @xmath3 and @xmath11 , thereby providing a complete specification of these winds .",
    "in addition to iras  13349 + 2438 , the nearby bright seyfert mcg  6 - 30 - 15 has been observed to show , as one of the multiple ionization zones , an x - ray ionized absorber with an outflow velocity of @xmath318 km  s@xmath7 at @xmath319 and @xmath320@xmath25 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "clearly , a different choice of a set of conserved quantities ( wind variables ) in the model would produce a slightly different field line geometry in which the resulting mhd outflow could in principle obtain higher los velocities ( perhaps by factors of magnitudes ) , and this will be studied in detail in a future work .    as noted above our model",

    "the shape of the ionizing spectrum used so far ( @xmath333 between 13.6 ev and 13.6 kev with @xmath214 ) is quite simplistic , however , such spectra are often used in similar type calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is a crude approximation to the observed spectra characterized by complex spectral shapes .",
    "spectral features like the bbb and the uv to x - ray luminosity ratio @xmath334 @xcite play a role in our results ( a recent review of the broad band agn seds can be found , e.g. , in * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite sampled 110 bright soft - xray selected agns for a simultaneous study of optical / uv and x - ray data and reported strong correlations between the x - ray spectral slope and the optical / uv slope which should be included in a more comprehensive treatment .",
    "multi - components of the broad - band agn spectra , as those discussed by @xcite and @xcite , should play an important role in characterizing the observed x - ray spectral features .",
    "adding softer photons ( responsible for the optical / uv components ) could impact the radiative transfer between those more complex photon distributions and the ionized matter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for multi - component injected spectra ) .",
    "in fact , we have mimicked the presence of such softer photons by choosing larger values of the spectral index of our models ( @xmath335 ) . for the same total luminosity ( implemented in the definition of @xmath2 ) , it was found in this trial run that the radial position of the peak column density of a given ion ( e.g. ) decreases , because the presence of a given ion requires a certain flux of _ ionizing _ photons per atom ; in a steep spectrum the proper ratio is found at larger values of the parameter @xmath2 or correspondingly smaller values of the distance @xmath336 . as a result , the widths of the corresponding transitions should be larger and therefore the proper ionizing spectrum is necessary for the correct interpretation of the relations between ionic column densities and wind kinematics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar approach ) .",
    "the ionizing source has been considered , for simplicity , to be point - like .",
    "a source of finite size will provide for more complex illumination , especially for parts of the wind at which the source angular extent is significant .",
    "most importantly an extended source would impact the absorption line profiles , since a line of sight may pass through matter other than that used in section 3.2 .",
    "finally , to treat the radiative transfer correctly at all energies , one should eventually need to resort to a 2d approach rather than the 1d model ( radial only ) presently used , which would modify the global ionization structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d]b ) .",
    "the wind equations , as presently implemented include only mhd forces , while it is apparent that in the presence of the ionic species we produce one should also include the effects of radiation pressure .",
    "because the latter depends on the ionization state of the plasma which in turn depends on its kinematics , implemented correctly , this should be done iteratively in a way similar to @xcite . based on the rather small effect that the radiation force seems to have on the structure of these winds",
    ", we believe that our present results are generally valid .",
    "in summary , we have presented above a first attempt at interfacing theoretical models of mhd winds with agn observations , in particular the absorption features in their x - ray spectra of ionized outflows .",
    "we have placed most of our emphasis on modeling the corresponding amds , which , based on the existing observations seems to favor a specific value of the model parameter @xmath35 which determines the radial density dependence of our models , namely @xmath299 . with the value of this parameter set by observation , our models present a _ two - parameter _ family of agn wind structure , namely @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "we have found that , based on the limited number of objects discussed above , our models fare rather well in accommodating the observations and the possibility of incorporating agn unification within the same models , as discussed in kk94 .",
    "there is still a multitude of issues related to x - ray absorption that remain open , e.g. whether the model can accommodate the high velocity ( @xmath337 ) outflows associated with x - ray absorption features ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for some attempts with monte carlo simulations ) in the spectra of some bright quasars such as apm  08279 + 5255 , pg  1211 + 143 and pds  456 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the context of our model",
    "this point may be well explained with an optimized magnetic field geometry [ i.e. @xmath58 distribution determined by gs - equation  ( [ eq : gs ] ) ] that provides a favorable los velocity component .",
    "important as they are , these go beyond the scope of the present work and we expect to return to them in future publications .    we are grateful to our anonymous referee for his / her constructive comments that improved the manuscript .",
    "we would like to thank tim kallman for his help with ` xstar ` incisive comments .",
    "we express our gratitude to george chartas for his comments on the model , takanori sakamoto and javier garcia for their assistance with scripting and running ` xstar ` as well as helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa adp grant ."
