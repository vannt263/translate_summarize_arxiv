    "communication ( ivc ) based on wireless communication among vehicles is widely regarded as a promising application for novel transportation services with applications in traffic safety , advanced traveler information and driver assistance systems  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional communication channels which operate with a centralized broadcasting concept via radio or mobile - phone services , vehicular ad hoc networks ( vanets ) provide a _ decentralized approach _ that does not rely on public infrastructure . since direct wireless communication has a limited range of , typically , a few hundreds of meters , the effectiveness of potential applications depends crucially on the market penetration .",
    "the percentage of equipped vehicles is expected to remain well below  10% for the next years , so any realistic concept is required to operate at penetration levels of a few percent .",
    "wireless local area networks based on ieee  802.11 have shown broadcast ranges between  200 and   in automobile applications  @xcite .",
    "however , vanets have several characteristics that distinguish them from other ad hoc networks . among those",
    "is the potential change in the node distribution due to the movement of sender / receiver vehicles .",
    "for this reason , dedicated protocols and transmission standards are intensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "detailed network simulation tools have also been applied to vanet in order to examine the influences of environmental conditions and node mobility on connectivity  @xcite . for an overview of the technical architectures and protocols , and current research projects and consortia initiatives , we refer to the survey of hartenstein and laberteaux  @xcite .    in most automobile applications ,",
    "it is necessary to carry messages over distances that are significantly longer than the device s broadcast range meaning that , in general , several equipped vehicles acting as relays are necessary to transport the message to the final destinations .",
    "depending on the application and the specific ivc strategy , a certain minimum percentage of equipped cars is necessary for operation .",
    "this characterizes the fundamental problem of a _ market penetration threshold_. there are two basic strategies of message propagation :    1 .",
    "a message can be passed backwards to the following equipped vehicle , which then passes it to the next equipped vehicle , and so on , resulting in a node connectivity via multiple hops .",
    "we call this _ longitudinal hopping _ , as the message always propagates parallel to the travel direction of the first sender and the last receiver .",
    "2 .   a sender may transfer a message to a vehicle driving in the opposite direction .",
    "this vehicle can store the message and continuously broadcast it for a certain period of time , while physically transporting the message upstream .",
    "although this message is of no use for the relay vehicle , it might eventually be received by an equipped vehicle driving in the original direction by a second transversal hop .",
    "we therefore call this strategy `` store and forward '' , or _ transversal hopping_.    the longitudinal hopping mode has the advantage of virtually instantaneous message transmission , so the transmitted information is always up - to - date .",
    "however , the longitudinal communication chain typically fails when the broadcast range  @xmath0 is of the same order or smaller than the typical distance between equipped vehicles . for realistic broadcast ranges of a few hundreds meters",
    "the penetration threshold is about 10% for typical densities on freeways  @xcite .",
    "this restriction can be overcome by the transversal hopping mode , for which the successful transmission is only a matter of time , but the information may be already obsolete when it finally arrives .",
    "the direct connectivity is determined mainly by the broadcast range , the traffic density , the market penetration of ivc vehicles and the distribution of equipped vehicles in the traffic stream .",
    "the traffic density characterizes the global number of vehicles , but varies strongly in congested traffic conditions .",
    "we will therefore focus on the influence of the traffic dynamics on the connectivity of the ad - hoc network of equipped cars .",
    "this delay - based connectivity ist most useful for traveler traffic information services rather than safety applications .",
    "previous work on connectivity has been mainly focused on instantaneous connectivity . in the literature , the multiple hopping of messages in longitudinal direction has been studied by several authors  @xcite . due to the inherent complexity of mobile ad hoc communication within the traffic stream , realistic simulations are also essential for validating the analytical models and testing ivc use cases  @xcite .",
    "fewer investigations considered the transverse propagation process by means of simulation  @xcite . to our knowledge , no analytical models have been proposed or investigated for this type of ivc message transport .    in this paper , we will consider the transverse message propagation mode in which messages are transported by vehicles traveling in opposite direction .",
    "the system and the relevant transmission processes are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : trans ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_trans ] , we will derive analytical probability distributions for message transmission times and related propagation speeds , assuming a poissonian distance distribution between equipped vehicles . by means of microscopic traffic simulations combining communication and",
    "bi - directional traffic flows , we test the theoretical predictions with numerical results for single and multi - lane roadways in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim_trans ] .",
    "in the subsequent section , we simulate an incident scenario and consider the propagation of information on shock - fronts and travel times to vehicles in the upstream direction , and discuss future applications in traveler information and `` traffic - adaptive '' cruise control systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diss ] , we conclude with a discussion of our findings .",
    "in this section , we consider a concept of inter - vehicle communication , using equipped vehicles in the opposite driving direction as relays .",
    "these vehicles transport the message to a destination region where it is delivered back to vehicles in the original driving directions .",
    "thus , the wireless communication part of the mechanism considered consists of exactly two `` transverse message hops '' across driving directions .    in the following ,",
    "a message is considered to be useful if it reaches an equipped vehicle driving in the same direction as the vehicle creating the initial message before the receiver reaches the position of the original message .",
    "for example , if the initial message contains information about a locally detected traffic jam , this information is useful only for vehicles sufficiently upstream of this location and driving in the same direction .",
    "specifically , we define as _ destination region _ all locations in this direction that are upstream of the original source by at least the distance @xmath1 ( typical values for @xmath1 are of the order of ) .",
    "message transmission by the transverse hopping strategy can be considered as a three - stage process :    1 .   after a message is generated by an equipped vehicle , the message is continually broadcasted by this vehicle for a certain time .",
    "it is received by a relay vehicle in the opposite driving direction after a time interval @xmath2 .",
    "the message is then transported by the relay vehicle . after a time interval @xmath3 ( with respect to the initial generation of the message ) this vehicle s broadcast range starts intersecting the destination region and",
    "the vehicle starts broadcasting the stored message .",
    "3 .   at time",
    "@xmath4 ( with respect to the initial generation time ) the message is received by an equipped vehicle in the destination region . the relay vehicle continues broadcasting until the message is considered to be obsolete ( the criteria for this condition will not be considered here ) .",

    "the relay car transports the message at least up to the position @xmath10 ( the destination region ) before broadcasting it again .",
    "finally , the message is received by an equipped car in direction  1 .",
    "transversal distances are neglected when determining the communication range @xmath0 . ]",
    "for the description of the information propagation via the opposite driving direction , we consider a bi - directional freeway or arterial road ( cf .",
    "[ fig : trans_sketch ] ) . in both directions , we assume essentially homogeneous traffic flows that are characterized by the lane - averaged velocities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the total densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . furthermore , we assume a global market penetration @xmath13 such that the relevant density variables are the _ partial densities of equipped vehicles _ , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "[ sec : stoch ] , we will relax this assumption and derive an analytical model for the more realistic case of distributed broadcast ranges  @xcite . by virtue of the assumed constant velocities ,",
    "the first relay vehicle having received the message will also be the first vehicle reaching the destination region , so we will ignore message reception and transport by subsequent relay vehicles .",
    "let us consider a message that is generated by an equipped vehicle driving in direction  1 at position @xmath16 and time @xmath7 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans_sketch ] , we use the same coordinate system for both directions such that driving direction  1 is parallel and direction  2 anti - parallel to the @xmath17-axis .",
    "we start with the spatial distribution of vehicles in the opposite driving direction .",
    "we assume that the distances between _ equipped _ vehicles are i.i.d .",
    "exponentially distributed stochastic variables which is a good approximation as long as the partial densities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are small  @xcite .",
    "because of the implied poisson process , the same distribution applies to the distance between _ any _ given location @xmath17 and the next equipped vehicle .",
    "first , we investigate the statistical properties of the time @xmath2 of the first transversal hop to a relay vehicle in the opposite direction  2 .",
    "since only the _ first _ transmission of a message is relevant , the reference point for finding such a vehicle is given by the `` best case '' .",
    "in this case , the initial position of the relay is at @xmath20 , i.e. , at the limit of the transmission range in the desired direction .",
    "the actually used transmitter vehicle is the equipped vehicle located next to this point when going in the direction of positive @xmath17 . according to the above assumptions , its initial position @xmath21 is a stochastic variable that is defined by the probability density @xmath22 here , the heaviside function @xmath23 ( which is equal to  @xmath24 for @xmath25 and equal to  1 for @xmath26 ) serves as a cut - off for receiver positions at @xmath27 , which are too remote .",
    "notice that a `` conventional '' exponential distribution would result when starting the search for a relay vehicle at @xmath16 , i.e. , setting @xmath28 .",
    "an instantaneous transversal hop of the generated message to the relay vehicle on roadway  2 is possible if it is within the broadcast range , @xmath29 .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath30 otherwise , a finite time interval @xmath2 is needed before the relay vehicle comes within communication range ( cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : trans_sketch ] ) .",
    "since the relative velocity between vehicles in opposite driving directions is @xmath31 , this time depends on the initial position @xmath21 according to @xmath32 .",

    ".      now we investigate the distribution of the time interval @xmath3 after which the message is available for retransmission to the original driving direction  1 , i.e. , the relay vehicle starts broadcasting the message .",
    "it should occur at a location @xmath37 that , for this direction , is sufficiently upstream of the original message source , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the transmission becomes possible when the relay vehicle passes the position @xmath39 . because of the assumed constant velocities @xmath9 in negative @xmath17-direction , the position of the relay vehicle depends on time according to @xmath40 , where the initial position @xmath21 is distributed according to the density  .",
    "notice that , by virtue of the constant velocity @xmath9 , the distribution function of the position of the relay vehicle is shifted uniformly in time . starting directly from its definition ,",

[ fig : jam_fronts ] at times between and ) . for these vehicles ,",
    "the `` age '' of the upstream information 1a lies between and .",
    "the downstream information 1b is even more recent .",
    "for the set of 9  vehicles located between message 1a and 2a , the average message age is .",
    "note that one can also take into account that a traffic management center or the police may send out `` public '' messages about the current traffic state , roadwork or incident conditions , complementing messages created by autonomous vehicles . representing this by a standing vehicle in the shoulder lane for the initial message broadcast , this will not change the further transmission times .",
    "a standing vehicle would correspond to a horizontal trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : jam_fronts ] .",
    "finally , we point out that messages regarding jam front positions are up - to - date as long as the _ collective _ traffic dynamics does not change significantly . while the downstream jam front is fixed at the bottleneck ( and therefore easy to predict at later times ) , the moving upstream front can be estimated with an accuracy of several  .",
    "however , data - fusion of _ several _ messages and model - based prediction can be used to reduce these errors dramatically  @xcite . for a quantitative analysis of such a vehicle - based jam - front detection",

    "inter - vehicle communication ( ivc ) based on vehicular ad hoc networks ( vanets ) is a promising and scalable concept for exchanging traffic - related information among vehicles over relatively short distances .",
    "advanced traveler information systems are recognized as an important application of this decentralized approach in the first deployment phase , as ivc will provide local and up - to - date traffic information .",
    "apart from the drivers appreciating such reliable and up - to - date traffic information , future driver assistance and safety systems may benefit from ivc as well , for example , by issuing warnings when a traffic jam or an accident is several hundred meters ahead .",
    "adaptive cruise control can automate the braking and acceleration of a car .",
    "processing of non - local information received via ivc could help future `` traffic - adaptive '' cruise control systems to anticipate the traffic situation and therefore to automatically adapt the driving style to it , increasing driving comfort , safety and traffic performance  @xcite .",
    "notice that the sensor technology needed for driver assistance systems can be used to automatically produce messages on an event - oriented basis .    however , like all technologies relying on local communication , ivc faces the `` penetration threshold problem '' .",
    "thus , the system is effective only if there is a sufficient number of communication partners to propagate the message between equipped cars .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to assess the feasibility of different communication variants in terms of the necessary critical market penetration .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated this aspect both , analytically and by simulation for a basic strategy of message dissemination by `` transverse hopping '' . in this mode ,",
    "equipped vehicles in the opposite driving direction are used to transport the messages serving as relays .",
    "our results indicate that the transverse hopping mechanism is favorable in the first stages of the deployment of an cooperative ivc system , since it is already effective for market penetration levels as low as 1 - 2% .    in order to gain more insights into the factors influencing the reliability and effectiveness of the `` store - and - forward '' message propagation in ivc systems , we derived analytical expressions for communication delay times .",
    "an important result of this paper is that the analytically derived statistics have been confirmed by extensive traffic simulations .",
    "although the main assumptions made in deriving these models  homogeneous traffic and exponentially distributed inter - vehicle distances  are normally not perfectly met in real traffic flow , it turns out that the theoretical results are remarkably robust with respect to violations of the models assumptions . in particular , for multi - lane traffic and penetration levels below  5% , the errors are typically a few percent only .",
    "notice that , in turn , the analytical expressions may also serve to test or validate new implementations of communication modules in traffic simulation software .",
    "one may wonder why the idealized assumptions work particularly well in multi - lane traffic which clearly is more complex than single - lane traffic .",
    "this is mainly caused by the possibility to change lanes and overtake thereby dissolving platoons behind slow vehicles .",
    "the positional correlations implied by platoons , in turn , are the main cause why the assumption of the poissonian positional distribution is not satisfied",
    ". other kinds of complexity , however , lower the reliability of this assumption . for example , in stop - and - go traffic or at intersections the overall traffic flow varies strongly ( typically on scales of per ) .",
    "such non - stationary traffic conditions can only be approximately treated as a superposition of the prevailing traffic densities .",
    "since our focus was on traffic dynamics rather than on the details of the communication protocols , we generally assumed idealized communication conditions , i.e. , instantaneous and error - free transmission below a certain direct communication range and a failure rate of 100% above .",
    "however , we have shown analytically that the transmission properties change in a predictable way when assuming more realistic communication conditions .",
    "for example , relaxing the assumption of a fixed communication range by treating the communication range as a random variable resulted in little changes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stoch ] ) .",
    "furthermore , assuming a complete failure of the communication chain with a probability @xmath106 simply will reduce the market penetration parameter @xmath13 by a factor @xmath107 , at least , as long as the failures can be considered to be uncorrelated .",
    "the assumption that a vehicle continuously broadcast messages could be relaxed by considering a periodic broadcast of messages in time intervals @xmath108 .",
    "this would result in two additional convolutions of the relevant transmission time @xmath4 with the uniform distribution in the interval @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "this essentially increases the median of the communication time by @xmath110 .",
    "it remains to be shown to which extent other imperfections of real communications ( such as delay times for establishing a direct communication , failures due to high relative velocities , or channel conflicts and contention for an increasing penetration level ) will influence the results . in any case , the microscopic details of dsrc communication require network simulation software such as ns2 .    for demonstration purposes",
    ", we considered a congestion - warning application in a complex traffic simulation which is operative for penetration rate as low as 1% .",
    "however , ivc is only one building block of a future integrated traffic communication system . as a straightforward next step , including police cars and emergency vehicles into the ivc fleet will lead to a timely production of event - related messages . furthermore , adding infrastructure - vehicle communication to the system may help to overcome the penetration barrier  @xcite",
    ". this will be particularly economic and efficient when placing the infrastructural communication units near to known bottlenecks , where the necessary sensors for producing event - based traffic messages are already in place .",
