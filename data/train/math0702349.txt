    "the conjugacy problem in groups has two versions : the conjugacy decision problem ( cdp ) is to decide whether given two elements are conjugate or not ; the conjugacy search problem ( csp ) is to find a conjugating element for a given pair of conjugate elements .",
    "the conjugacy problem is of great interest for the artin braid group @xmath0 , which has the well - known artin presentation  @xcite : @xmath1    in the late sixties , garside  @xcite first solved the conjugacy problem in the braid groups , and then his theory has been generalized and enriched by many mathematicians . the algorithms for solving the conjugacy problem , provided by garside s theory , involve computation of finite nonempty subsets of the conjugacy class such as the summit set  @xcite , the super summit set  @xcite , the ultra summit set  @xcite , the stable super summit set  @xcite , the stable ultra summit set  @xcite and the reduced super summit set  @xcite .",
    "let us call these sets _ conjugacy representative sets_. the conjugacy representative sets depend not only on the group itself but also on the garside structure on it , which is a pair of a positive monoid ( equivalently , a lattice order invariant under left multiplication ) and a garside element .",
    "the braid group @xmath0 admits two well - known garside structures , the artin garside structure and the bkl garside structure .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the braid group @xmath0 endowed with the artin and the bkl garside structure , respectively .",
    "the best known upper bound of the complexity for computing a conjugacy representative set @xmath4 is of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the size of the set @xmath4 and @xmath7 is a polynomial in @xmath8 .",
    "franco and gonzlez - meneses  @xcite and gebhardt  @xcite showed this when @xmath4 is the super summit set and the ultra summit set , respectively , and it follows easily from their results that the complexities for computing the other conjugacy representative sets have upper bound of the same form .",
    "all of the known algorithms for solving the csp in braid groups , and more generally in garside groups , use a sort of _ exhaustive search _ in conjugacy representative sets .",
    "the most popular method is as follows : given two elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 , one computes the conjugacy representative set @xmath11 of @xmath9 and an element @xmath12 in the conjugacy representative set of @xmath10 , and then check whether @xmath12 belongs to @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the complexity of this kind of algorithms for the csp is at least the complexity for computing conjugacy representative sets , even when there exists a very short conjugating element .",
    "recently , birman , gebhardt and gonzlez - meneses  @xcite introduced two classes of subsets , called black and grey components , of an ultra summit set , and showed that the conjugacy problem can be solved by computing one black component and one grey component .",
    "this new algorithm is faster than the previous ones , however it does not improve the theoretical complexity .",
    "the size of a conjugacy representative set is exponential in the braid index @xmath8 in some cases , especially for reducible and periodic braids .",
    "see  @xcite or remark  [ rmk : size ] .",
    "( an @xmath8-braid is said to be _ periodic _ if some power of it belongs to @xmath13 , the center of @xmath0 , and _",
    "reducible _ if there is an essential curve system in the punctured disk which is invariant under the action of the braid . )",
    "therefore , a possible way to solve the csp more efficiently would be either to use different garside structures and garside groups such that the conjugacy representative set in question is small enough , or to develop an algorithm for computing a conjugating element not in an exhaustive way but in a deterministic way .    for periodic braids , birman , gonzlez - meneses and gebhardt showed in  @xcite that their new algorithm in  @xcite is not better than the previous one in  @xcite .",
    "hence they used in  @xcite different garside structures and garside groups in order to get a small super summit set . using this method ,",
    "they have proposed a polynomial - time algorithm for the csp for periodic braids .",
    "it is well - known that the cdp for periodic braids is very easy : the results of eilenberg  @xcite and kerkjrt  @xcite imply that an @xmath8-braid is periodic if and only if it is conjugate to a power of either @xmath14 or @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , hence    * an @xmath8-braid @xmath9 is periodic if and only if either @xmath18 or @xmath19 belongs to @xmath13 ; * two periodic braids are conjugate if and only if they have the same exponent sum .    in  @xcite ,",
    "birman , gonzlez - meneses and gebhardt showed the following .",
    "* the sizes of the ultra summit sets of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath3 are exponential in the braid index @xmath8 , hence the complexity of usual algorithms for the csp is not polynomial for periodic braids . *",
    "the super summit set of @xmath20 in @xmath2 is @xmath21 , hence the csp for @xmath14-type periodic @xmath8-braids is solvable in polynomial time ( in the braid index @xmath8 and the input word length ) by using the bkl garside structure on @xmath0 . *",
    "the csp for @xmath15-type periodic @xmath8-braids is solvable in polynomial time ( in the braid index @xmath8 and the input word length ) by using an algorithm for the csp for @xmath14-type periodic braids in @xmath22 , together with algorithms for computing an isomorphism from @xmath23 to @xmath24 and its inverse , where @xmath23 is the subgroup of @xmath0 consisting of @xmath8-braids that fix the second puncture and @xmath24 is the centralizer of @xmath25 in @xmath26 .    in this paper",
    "we develop a new polynomial - time ( in the braid index and the input word length ) algorithm for solving the csp for periodic braids only by exploiting the bkl garside structure on @xmath0 , and study how to improve efficiency of the algorithms .",
    "compared to the algorithm of birman et .",
    "al .  in  @xcite",
    ", our algorithm has lower complexity and , moreover , it uses a single garside group @xmath2 , hence the implementation is simpler .",
    "first , we study periodic elements in garside groups .",
    "an element of a garside group is said to be _ periodic _ if some power of it belongs to the cyclic group generated by the garside element .",
    "for periodic elements in garside groups , the super summit set is the same as the ultra summit set . observing the previous results of bestvina  @xcite and charney , meier and whittlesey  @xcite",
    ", we can see that every periodic element in garside groups has a special type of power , which we will call a _ bcmw - power_. we show the characteristics of bcmw - powers and its interesting property : the csp for two periodic elements @xmath27 and @xmath28 in a garside group is equivalent to the csp for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath29 is a bcmw - power of @xmath27 . then we study super summit sets of periodic elements in garside groups .",
    "especially , we show that super summit sets of a certain type of periodic elements are closed under any partial cycling .",
    "we show that , for some integers @xmath31 , the super summit set of @xmath32 in @xmath2 is exponentially large in the braid index @xmath8 . using the results on periodic elements in garside groups and using the characteristics of the bkl garside structure on braid groups , we present an explicit method to transform an arbitrary braid in the super summit set of @xmath32 to @xmath32 by applying partial cycling polynomially many times , even when the super summit set is exponentially large .    on the other hand , we discuss concrete methods for improving efficiency of the algorithms .",
    "especially , using a known algorithm for powering integers  @xcite and our recent result on abelian subgroups of garside groups  @xcite , we propose an algorithm for computing a super summit element of a power of a periodic element in a garside group more efficiently .",
    "we hope that the results of this paper on periodic elements in garside groups are also useful in studying periodic elements in other garside groups .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 gives a brief review on garside groups and braids groups with the bkl garside structure .",
    " 3 studies periodic elements in garside groups and their super summit sets .  4 studies super summit sets of @xmath15-type periodic braids in @xmath2 , and shows a method to find a conjugating element for any two braids in the super summit set of @xmath32 .",
