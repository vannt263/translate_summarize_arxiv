    "at low temperature , the dynamics of complex media is dominated by the potential energy landscape ( pel ) , i.e. the multi - dimensional surface of the potential energy as a function of the molecular coordinates .",
    "@xcite a disordered system sampling different pel configurations undergoes `` dynamic phase transitions , '' perhaps one of the most spectacular ideas of the physics of complexity @xcite . for the dynamic glassy transition , observed in a certain class of ( glass - forming ) supercooled liquids ,",
    "this `` configurational sampling '' is at the origin of an increase of viscosity of several orders of magnitudes , up to values comparable to solids ( for recent reviews see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon can not be directly ascribed to a purely thermodynamic transition ; conversely , it is now widely accepted as a dynamic effect . during cooling ,",
    "different pel regions are visited , and the almost abrupt change of viscosity is associated to the transition from `` saddle - dominated '' to `` minima - dominated '' pel basins .",
    "since phonons are the elementary excitations around minima of the pel , this process is also denoted `` phonon - saddle '' transition , and can be realized while keeping fixed the temperature and acting on some parameter , like the particle density or the interaction range .",
    "@xcite    it is not difficult to recognize the fundamental character of these ideas , and the fact that they are not limited to the specific contexts where they originally developed . in this article",
    "i will show that a light beam propagating in disordered medium ( i.e. a medium with negligible optical losses whose refractive index is randomly varying ) may undergo a sort of dynamic phase transition .",
    "this happens when , due to an optically nonlinear response , multiple filaments are generated .",
    "their number and properties depend on the mutual interaction range and , in essence , they behaves like molecules in a complex medium , exhibiting dynamic phases .",
    "the process can described in terms of the appropriately defined `` inherent structures '' and `` saddles , '' in perfect analogy with the physics of disordered materials .",
    "this qualifies as a sort of _ soft _ , or _ complex _ , light .",
    "here the word `` filament '' ( roughly ) identifies a spatial soliton ( ss ) , which is a non - diffracting light beam generated in an optically nonlinear medium , with an intensity dependent refractive index .",
    "@xcite if a sufficiently intense laser light propagates in such a material , self - induced trapping counteracts the natural tendency to diffract , and a tightly focused ss can be observed .",
    "for example , in nematic liquid crystals ( nlc ) , with laser wavelength in the near infrared , it is possible to generate very thin ( few microns waist ) sss , able to propagate undistorted for millimeters : hundreds of times the distances attainable in absence of a nonlinear self - action .",
    "@xcite    at each ss is associated an optically induced perturbation @xmath0 to the refractive index , which is at the origin of the self - focusing .",
    "if the incident beam is sufficiently wide many sss are generated by the same input , as shown for example in @xcite .",
    "these filaments may propagate with various degrees of interaction , relying on the material properties and , in particular , on the so - called `` non - locality '' , which can be kept in mind as the ratio between the spatial extension of the refractive index perturbation induced by one filament and its transverse intensity waist . in nlc",
    ", the degree of nonlocality can be simply controlled by a voltage bias,@xcite and hence the dynamic phase transition may be induced accordingly.@xcite    the following results not only are well suited to describe light - soft - matter interaction ( as in @xcite ) , but can be applied to interpret the dynamics of ultrashort laser pulses propagating in air , @xcite as well solitons in photorefractives,@xcite media with thermal nonlinearities and plasmas , @xcite semiconductors @xcite , discrete solitons ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , plasmas @xcite and bose - condensed gases @xcite .",
    "this article is aimed to the introduction of the leading idea , and to a phenomenological description , supported by brownian dynamics and stochastic partial differential equations ( pdes ) numerical simulations . in order to simplify as much as possible the presentation no attempt will be made to a theoretical analysis , which is deferred to future publications . in section",
    "ii the model for the propagation of several light filaments in a random medium is linked with brownian dynamics . in section iii evidences of phase transitions from numerical simulations",
    "are reported .",

    "v the generalized inherent structures are considered for the final settlement of the dynamic phase transition . in section vi the noise quenching process is addressed . in section vii a connection with the theory of random matrices and the so - called dynamic structure factor is established . in section viii numerical simulations of a well known model in nonlocal soliton theory",
    "validate the general arguments of the manuscript .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section ix .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the analysis is done with reference to one - dimensional ( 1 + 1d propagation ) beams .",
    "indeed , differently from standard thermodynamic transitions , dynamic transitions can be obtained in low dimensional systems . additionally , the considered case reflects typical experimental geometries for the investigation of modulational instability ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensional problems of what follow can be readily imagined .",
    "consider the fock - leontovich equation , which describes the paraxial optical propagation in a nonlinear medium : @xmath1}{n}a=0\\text{.}\\ ] ] @xmath2 is the complex amplitude of the optical field such that @xmath3 is the intensity , @xmath4 is the wave - vector and @xmath5 the refractive index at wavelength @xmath6 in absence of non - linear effects .",
    "@xmath0 is the optical induced perturbation to @xmath5 , its functional relation with @xmath7 is non - local : the specific distribution of @xmath8 depends on the whole profile @xmath9 .",
    "various models are given in the literatures relating @xmath0 and @xmath7 , as the kukhtarev equations for photorefractives , ( for a review , see del re and coworkers in @xcite ) the heat equation for thermal nonlinearities , @xcite re - orientational equations for liquid crystals , @xcite mode coupling theory for soft - matter , @xcite or generic nonlocalities .",
    "@xcite    for relatively low intensities",
    "@xmath0 is linear with @xmath7 and , in the presence of many incoherent filaments , it can be written as the sum of the intensity distributions of the filaments , with @xmath10 .",
    "the overall @xmath0 is thus the sum of the index perturbations of each ss : @xmath11=\\displaystyle\\sum_{p=1}^{n}\\delta n[i_p]\\text{.}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ deltan ] ) is valid whenever @xmath12 , as typically verified in the reported experiments , and when the filaments are mutually incoherent , i.e. the relative phase between pairs of them is randomly varying .",
    "the latter hypothesis typically holds in soft - matter , by taking into account that the sss spontaneously generate from noisy intensity perturbations , and propagate in a thermally fluctuating medium .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of many filaments the effects of the relative phases and , more in general , of the specific form of @xmath13 $ ] can be negligible .",
    "this is analogous to the typical approach in statistical physics where , quite often , the particular profile of pair - interaction potentials can be replaced by some simple model like the lennard - jones potential .",
    "@xcite    following a perturbative analysis , the effect of the index perturbation due to all sss on the trajectory of the generic filament @xmath14 is considered . for @xmath15",
    "identical _ stable _ solitons with intensity bell - shaped profile @xmath16 , @xmath17(x)$ ] , and average position @xmath18 , using the ehrenfest s theorem of standard quantum mechanics , applied to the schrdinger - like eq .",
    "( [ foch ] ) , one has for the generic filament @xmath19 with @xmath20 the power ( per unit length along the @xmath21 direction ) into each filament , which plays the role of the particle mass .",
    "the index perturbation is @xmath22 which used in ( [ particle0 ] ) yields @xmath23 with @xmath24 the pair - interaction potential .",
    "many derivations of similar results can be found in the literature on solitons and solitary waves ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "the analysis is specialized for the potential energy landscape interpretation .    in ( [ particle1 ] ) the self - interaction term ( @xmath25 )",
    "can be retained since it clearly gives a vanishing contribution .",
    "finally @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the overall potential energy surface ( the pel ) given by the sum of pair - wise interaction terms : @xmath28 the dynamics along the direction of propagation is hence formally reduced to an ensemble of particles , evolving with `` time '' @xmath29 .",
    "the fluctuations of the medium result into a random contribution to @xmath0 that can be phenomenologically included in the model as a langevin force @xmath30 : @xmath31 in the following , i will take for @xmath32 a normally distributed white noise : @xmath33 with @xmath34 the noise `` power '' and the brackets denoting a statistical average over disorder .",
    "@xmath30 takes into account the fluctuations of the refractive index and defines a realization of the random soft - medium .    note that , in typical langevin models , the random term is accompanied by a dissipative term , which is in general dependent on the lossy mechanisms in the medium , like viscosity . in the limit of small losses and small noise",
    "such a term can be neglected , as it will be done in the following in order to leave the treatment as general and simple as possible .",
    "the qualitative agreement with numerical results in section viii , and experiments @xcite , supports this approach .",
    "the explicit shapes of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are due to the particular nonlinear mechanism ; for the present purpose a gaussian ansatz for both of them is appropriate , since non - local optically nonlinear media are being considered .",

    "@xmath41 is a gaussian function within an arbitrary additive constant .",
    "it is written as in ( [ pairwisepotential ] ) in order to have a vanishing @xmath42 when all the solitons are in the same position ( `` condensed phase '' ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the sum of the variances of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and provides a measure of the interaction range between the sss for a fixed @xmath44 , like @xmath45 that will be used in the following .",
    "each filament increases the refractive index ( the medium is assumed to be focusing , @xmath46 ) and the interaction is purely attractive , so that @xmath47 .",
    "the previous formulation points the connections with statistical physics while reducing the model to a system of interacting classical particles undergoing brownian motion , a typical model for colloids , where the formation of clusters at the glass - transition is a well - known process ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , before proceeding , it is fruitful to point out a subtle issue associated to eqs .",
    "( [ particle3 ] ) and ( [ pairwisepotential ] ) .",
    "it is well expected that a finite number of classical particles , interacting by a purely attractive potential , will oscillate around the center of mass at equilibrium ( i.e. for long times ) .",
    "this implies that only one energy minimum does exist and corresponds to the condensed phase .",
    "at a first glance , no dynamic phase transition , due to local minima of the pel , is expected . nevertheless , in the case under consideration",
    ", it is clearly not possible to consider an arbitrarily large propagation distance ( corresponding to long times ) .",
    "if losses are negligible and if the maximum observation range ( in @xmath29 ) is limited by the spatial extension of the sample , damping mechanisms can be neglected and local pel minima play a role .",
    "a typical distance between resolvable ( by means of the observation of scattered light from the sample ) spatial solitons , generated for example by modulational instability , can be taken as @xmath48 times their waist @xmath44 . hence , considering thin solitons with waist @xmath49 and taking tens of filaments implies an input waist of the order of @xmath50 , which is comparable to those typically employed in experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the following two representative cases",
    "will be considered : @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( the principal dynamic phase transition , considered below , is obtained up to the largest considered @xmath53 , not reported ) . in all the simulations",
    "the filaments are chosen uniformly distributed at @xmath54 , with mutual distance @xmath55 .",
    "the noise `` power '' is measured by the corresponding adimensional quantity @xmath56 which is taken independent from @xmath14 , for the sake of simplicity : @xmath57 .",
    "the amount of noise to be included in the simulations clearly relies on the specific material ( in particular , on the thermal coefficient of the refractive index and on the sample temperature ) ; however it is found that the numerical results are very robust with respect to noise , and very similar findings are obtained when @xmath58 is varied by order of magnitudes . hence only the case @xmath59 will be reported as a representative example .",
    "the stochastic ordinary differential equations ( [ particle3 ] ) are solved by a second order scheme , whose accuracy has been thoroughly investigated and compared with other approaches.@xcite the results have been validated by halving the integration step and doubling the number of realization in many cases .    as discussed above , a dynamic transition is attained while increasing the density , or equivalently the interaction length @xmath45.@xcite here , this corresponds to increase the degree of nonlocality . in figure",
    "[ fign10 ] , some realizations of the sss trajectories , obtained by the numerical solution of eqs .",

    "the adimensional `` time '' @xmath60 $ ] is used on the horizontal axis . for small @xmath45",
    "the filaments propagate in the presence of a reduced interaction .",

    "clearly , in certain ranges of the control parameter @xmath45 the statistics of the final positions are highly peaked around @xmath63 or @xmath64 clusters , while they spread over a broad region in other ranges .",
    "the appearance of an interval for @xmath45 where two dominant clusters are generated is evident .",
    "this is referred to as the `` principal dynamics phase transition '' . in the case",
    "@xmath51 a phase with @xmath64 clusters is also present and it is somehow more noisy in the case for @xmath52 . for a very large @xmath45",
    "the nonlocality is such that all the sss oscillate around an equilibrium position , this has been above indicated as the condensed phase .",
    "similar results are obtained for an odd number of filaments ( e.g. @xmath65 ) . in that case ,",
    "in correspondence of the principal dynamic phase transition , an additional ss is found at the middle of the two clusters .",
    "an open issue is the existence of fractal structures as those investigated in @xcite .     for a given noise realization and various values of the interaction range @xmath45 ( here @xmath51 ) .",

    "note that the positions are determined at a very large @xmath66 so that the clusters are `` stabilized , '' and that the average positions for each filament ( thick black line in the figures ) are shown superimposed ( i.e. they are not the average positions among all the filaments ) , so that the thick black line provides a visualization of cluster distribution .",
    "disordered phases are alternated with others in which a fixed number of clusters is obtained . in order to address the existence of some kind of phase transition",
    "it is necessary to introduce a `` control parameter '' , as outlined in the mentioned literature .",
    "@xcite with this aim , i start pointing out the _ inherent structure _ ( is ) associated to the numerical simulations . once fixed a maximum value for the time @xmath67 ,",
    "the final distribution of filaments is used as guess for a conjugate gradient minimization procedure that finds the nearest minimum of the interaction potential @xmath42 .",

    "the minimum for the potential energy is obtained at large @xmath45 when all the solitons are in the same position and corresponds to @xmath73 ( condensed phase ) ; conversely when the solitons are uniformly distributed ( small @xmath45 ) @xmath42 is at maximum .",
    "hence , while increasing @xmath45 , @xmath42 is reduced , due to the coagulation mechanism . the data in figures [ figeisn10 ] and [ figeisn30 ] show a decrease of @xmath69 vs @xmath45 up to the first plateau , at the formation of two clusters .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath74 is obtained after ( [ pel ] ) , by observing that , when two clusters of @xmath75 sss are formed ( for @xmath15 even ) , @xmath76 as their mutual distance goes to infinity .",
    "the plateau for @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath77 , and to @xmath78 for @xmath52 .",
    "the trend is conserved for various numbers of filaments .",
    "the scale on the @xmath45 axis changes with @xmath15 ( see figs .",
    "[ figeisn10 ] and [ figeisn30 ] ) because the degree of nonlocality needed for the phase transition obviously increases with the number of filaments .",
    "for the definitive settlement of the phonon - saddle transition , the so - called _ generalized inherent structure _ ( gis ) must also be taken into account .",
    "@xcite it is defined as the nearest stationary point of the pel ( where all the forces are zero ) to the final configuration .",
    "the latter is used as a guess in a nonlinear solver ( i used the c05pbf nag routine , mark 19 ) for the @xmath15 equations @xmath79 , whose solution , given by a vector @xmath68 is just the gis .",
    "the saddle - order @xmath80 of the gis is the number of the negative eigenvalues ( imaginary frequencies ) of the hessian of @xmath42 , [ see eq .",
    "( [ hessian ] ) below ] calculated at the gis ; if @xmath81 the gis is a minimum .    for any realization of the system",
    "there is one is and one gis . in a phonon - dominated phase",
    "the two structures are the same and @xmath81 .",
    "conversely , in a saddle - dominated phase @xmath82 , but it tends approximately to zero ( on average over many realizations ) in correspondence of the dynamic phase - transition .",
    "@xcite    to understand the physical meaning of the gis , consider the principal dynamic phase transition . while the is corresponds to the filaments equally distributed between the two clusters , the gis differs for some of the sss positioned at intermediate places ; it denotes the way the system may escape from the energy minimum .",
    "clearly , if the noise - averaged @xmath80 is high the probability to find a direction in pel to get out from the local minimum of @xmath42 is high : it somehow measures the number of escape directions from the pel minimum .",
    "actually , the average @xmath80 never reaches the zero as discussed in @xcite , because this would correspond to a complete freezing of the system .",
    "figure [ figkgisn10 ] shows the noise - averaged @xmath80 vs @xmath45 when @xmath51 .",
    "it clearly reveals a saddle - phonon transition in proximity of @xmath83 ; consistently with the phase - diagram in figure [ figeisn10 ] . for larger values of @xmath45 ,",
    "the additional dynamic phase transitions are not well defined ( i.e. @xmath80 stays around one or two units ) due to the limited number of particles .",
    "this also clarifies the reason for introducing a `` principal '' dynamic phase transition , as done above .",
    "the latter , in the considered numerical simulations , always corresponds to the formation of two clusters .",
    "this is confirmed in the case @xmath52 ( shown in figure [ figkgisn30 ] ) where , due to an increased number of degrees of freedom , the transition is more evident , and happens , as before , when two clusters are generated . the transition becomes more evident as larger values of @xmath15 are considered , and it is found up to the largest considered value ( i.e. @xmath53 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the case @xmath51 shows evidence of this phenomenon , which is hence observable even with a limited number of filaments . roughly speaking a given ensemble of filaments",
    "can self - organize in various way in order to form clusters .",
    "two symmetrical clusters is obviously a strong `` attractor '' for the system , because there is only one way to organize it ( conversely a larger number of clusters can be formed with different aggregations of solitons ) .",

    "indeed , when two clusters are formed and move far apart each other , there is an evident energy transfer along @xmath105 . in some sense",

    "if some noise is present in the system , a brownian dynamics model is readily introduced , and the filaments behave like particles dispersed into a solvent , which is one of the simplest definitions of soft - matter . the dynamic phase transition is the natural way to describe phenomenological transformations , like the formation of clusters .",
    "this has been shown by numerical experiments in this article and experimentally in future publications .",
    "nonlinear optics can be hence used to test , theoretically and experimentally , some of the ideas of the physics of complexity , as well as the latter can be used to explain many high - field phenomena , like laser - filaments generation and interaction . in this manuscript",
