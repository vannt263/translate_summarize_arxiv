    "the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data has confirmed the validity of the standard model ( sm ) in an impressive way .",
    "the quantum effects of the sm have been established at the @xmath6 level , and the direct and indirect determinations of the top quark mass are compatible with each other . in spite of this success , the conceptual situation with the sm is not completely satisfactory for a number of deficiencies .",
    "some of them are the large number of free parameters and the hierarchical fermion masses .",
    "the sm contains three generations of quarks in irreducible representations of the gauge symmetry group @xmath7 .",
    "the possibility of extending them has been studied in different frameworks @xcite-@xcite which are based either on a fourth generation sequential family , or on non - sequential fermions , regularly called exotic representations because they are different from those of the sm .",
    "these unusual representations emerge in other theories , like the @xmath8 model where a singlet bottom type quark appears in the fundamental representation @xcite ; also , top - like singlets have been suggested in supersymmetric gauge theories@xcite .",
    "the principal feature of a model which extends the quark sector with an exotic fermion is that there are new quark mixing phases in addition to the single phase of the sm .",
    "therefore , in this kind of models @xmath9 boson mediated fcnc s arise at tree level .",
    "this fact can affect the mixing mechanism in the neutral @xmath10-system @xcite-@xcite .    the possibility of indirect consequences of singlet quark mixing for fcnc and cp violation has been used to get bounds on the flavor changing couplings .",
    "heavy meson decays like @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite , @xcite , rare decays @xmath13 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , measurements like @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 meson physics @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , or even @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xcite have been considered for this purpose .    in the last years",
    ", the lep and slc colliders have brought to completion a remarkable experimental program by collecting an enormous amount of electroweak precision data on the @xmath9 resonance .",
    "this activity , together with the theoretical efforts to provide accurate sm predictions have formed the apparatus of electroweak precision tests @xcite .",
    "we are interested in using the electroweak precision test quantities in order to get bounds on the mixing angles for additional fermions in exotic representations .",
    "specifically , we want to consider models that include a new quark with charge @xmath20 which is mixed with the sm bottom quark .",
    "this kind of new physics was taken into account by bamert , et .",
    "@xcite during the discrepancy between experiment and sm theory in the @xmath3 ratio .",
    "they analyzed a broad class of models in order to explain the discrepancy , and they considered those models in which new @xmath21 couplings arise at tree level through @xmath9 or @xmath22 quark mixing with new particles .",
    "our presentation is based on the parametrization of the @xmath0 vertex in an independent model formulation .",
    "therefore these results can be used for different quark representations like singlet down quark , vector doublets model , mirror fermions and self conjugated triplets , etc .",
    "the parametrization of the vertex in a general way has been reviewed by barger et .",
    "@xcite , @xcite as well as cotti and zepeda @xcite .",
    "the lep precision test parameters that we use are the total @xmath9 width @xmath23 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the procedure to get bounds on the mixing angles is the following .",
    "first , we analyze the @xmath0 vertex as obtained after a rotation of a general quark multiplet ( common charge ) into mass eigenstates . in particular",
    ", we write down the neutral current terms for the bottom quarks , which are assumed to be mixed . with these expressions",
    "we can evaluate the tree level contribution to the process @xmath24 ; we enclose this new contribution within the coupling constants @xmath25 ( vectorial ) and @xmath26 ( axial ) .",
    "we then write down @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 including the new contributions , and we obtain bounds on the new parameters by using the experimental values from lep and slc @xcite . finally , we do a @xmath27 analysis and find the allowed region in the plane of the new parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 introduced .",
    "we also use the result obtained by grossman et .",
    "al . , involving @xmath30@xcite , in order to narrow down the bounds in the contour plots .",
    "to restrict new physics , we will use parameters measured at the @xmath9 pole .",
    "these parameters are the total decay width of the @xmath9 boson @xmath1 , the fractions @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xcite , @xcite . considering the new physics ( np ) and the sm couplings , we can write @xmath35    \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & n_{c}r_{qcd+qed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the number of colors , @xmath37 are the qcd and qed corrections , and @xmath38 is the kinematic factor @xcite with @xmath39 gev .",
    "we also are taking into account the oblique and vertex contributions to @xmath40 giving by the top quark and higgs boson .",
    "for our purpose , it is convenient to separate the sm and np contributions as follows : @xmath41 the symbol @xmath42 is given by : @xmath43 + 2\\beta ^{2}\\left [ \\left ( g_{a}^{np}\\right ) ^{2}+2g_{a}^{np}g_{a}^{sm}\\right ] } { \\left ( 3-\\beta ^{2}\\right ) \\left ( g_{v}^{sm}\\right ) ^{2}+2\\beta ^{2}\\left ( g_{a}^{sm}\\right ) ^{2}}.\\ ] ] this equation could be written using the new physics parameters @xmath44 that were introduced in the eq .",
    "( [ npparam ] ) , through the relationships @xmath45 and @xmath46    similarly , the @xmath9 decay into hadrons after considering the np , can be written as : @xmath47 here , only @xmath48 gets np corrections because only the sm bottom mixes with the exotic quark .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9 partial decay into @xmath49 and @xmath50 quarks remains unchanged .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath1 is equal to @xmath51 which again is re - written , with the eq.([hadron ] ) , as follows : @xmath52    using the above equations , for @xmath53 and @xmath54 we obtain the following expressions : @xmath55 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a general way , @xmath3 is mainly a measure of @xmath56 ; therefore , the fraction @xmath3 is very sensitive to anomalous couplings of the @xmath22 quark .",

    "this matrix is unitarity , whereas in our model it is not : @xmath69 @xmath70 corresponds to the mixing of the ordinary - exotic quarks .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath71 is not quite unitary and the factor @xmath72 indicates flavor changing transitions in the light - light sector .",

    "they can be produced fc transitions at the tree level depending of @xmath90 entries which are the mixing angles of the ordinary and exotic fermions .    in this work ,",
    "we only consider one @xmath91 exotic quark ( i.e. not mixing with @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
