    "with the recent lhc discovery of the 125 gev scalar particle @xcite , we are one step closer to understanding the mechanism of ewsb . the standard model ( sm ) higgs mechanism lacks a fundamental explanation and has , therefore , been long questioned .",
    "indeed , inspired from our experience with qcd , it has been speculated that the scalar responsible for ewsb may not be fundamental but , instead , some form of a fermion - antifermion bound state , which is generated dynamically by some new strong interaction at a higher scale @xcite .",
    "the  conventional \" models for this scenario are based on the nambu - jona - lassinio ( njl ) mechanism @xcite , in which dynamical ewsb ( dewsb ) is triggered by the condensation of heavy fermions",
    ". however , such models have one major caveat : the typical mass of the heavy fermionic condensate , @xmath5 , tends to lie in the range @xmath6 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , such a composite tends to be too heavy to account for the recently discovered 125 gev higgs - like particle.@xmath7}$ ] because of this difficulty , in this paper we propose an alternative solution for the tev - scale dewsb scenario , in which a light sm - like higgs with a mass of @xmath8 emerges .",
    "we basically construct , as we will elaborate later , a hybrid dewsb setup by adding an unconstrained scalar field at the compositeness scale , which behaves essentially like a  fundamental \" field .",
    "indeed , one of the early attempts in this direction investigated the possibility of using the top - quark as the agent of dewsb via top - condensation @xcite , in a generalization of the njl model .",
    "however , the resulting dynamical top mass turns out to be appreciably heavier than @xmath0 , thus making it difficult for top condensation to provide a viable picture . moreover , top - condensate models [ or njl models where the condensing fermions have masses of @xmath9 , require the cutoff for the new strong interactions to be many orders of magnitudes larger than @xmath0 , i.e. , of @xmath10 gev , resulting in a severely fine - tuned picture of dewsb .    in passing",
    ", we should mention that several interesting generalizations of the top - condensate model of @xcite , which potentially avoid these obstacles , have been suggested .",
    "for example , one can relax the requirement that only the top - condensate is responsible for the full ewsb @xcite , or assume that condensations of new heavier quarks and/or leptons drive ewsb @xcite .",
    "in such scenarios the resulting low - energy ( i.e. , ew - scale ) effective theory may contain more than a single composite higgs doublet @xcite .",
    "indeed , low - energy multi - higgs models , with new heavy fermions with masses of @xmath11 , are natural outcomes of a tev - scale dewsb scenario , since the heavy fermions are expected to be strongly coupled at the near by tev - scale and to lead to the formation of several condensates - possibly with sub - tev masses .    in this paper ,",
    "as alluded to above , we take another direction constructing a hybrid dewsb setup by adding an unconstrained scalar field at the compositeness scale which behaves as a  fundamental \" field where additional super - critical attractive 4-fermi operators form a composite scalar sector .",
    "the  fundamental \" scalar is unconstrained at the compositeness scale and may result from the underlying strong dynamics @xcite , e.g. , it can be the pseudo - goldstone boson of a global symmetry breaking at the strong interaction scale .",
    "this strongly coupled composite - plus - fundamental sectors are matched at the compositeness scale to a hybrid  4th generation \" 2hdm ( h4g2hdm ) , with one fundamental - like field ( @xmath12 ) which couples to the sm",
    "s light fermions and one auxiliary ( composite ) field ( @xmath13 ) which couples to the heavy quarks.@xmath14}$ ] the fundamental or unconstrained higgs field is thus responsible for the mass generation of the lighter sm fermions and for the observed ckm flavor pattern .",
    "we stress that the name  4th generation \" is used here for convenience only and should not be confused with the minimal sm4 framework , as we explicitly involve a 2hdm .",
    "furthermore , the dewsb mechanism proposed here can be generalized to the case of non - sequential heavy quarks , e.g. , new heavy vector - like quarks @xcite ( see further discussion in the summary ) . later in this paper , we will briefly explore the phenomenology and study the confrontation of this model with the latest lhc data as well as flavor and ew precision constraints .",
    "our h4g2hdm setup is motivated by the concept that new heavy fermions are expected to have purely dynamical masses , while a different mechanism is expected to underly the generation of mass for the lighter sm fermions .",
    "it further allows us to get a light 125 gev sm - like higgs , since its mass is mostly proportional to the quartic coupling of the fundamental field , which is unconstrained at the compositeness scale .",
    "that is , with this assignment , in our h4g2hdm the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs state does not receive the usual large quantum corrections from loops of the heavy dynamical fermions , which instead feed into the quartic coupling of the composite scalar .",
    "it should be noted that the simplest low - energy effective setup which may result from a tev - scale dewsb scenario is the so called sm4 , i.e. , the sm with a 4th sequential generation of heavy fermions and one higgs doublet .",
    "this minimal framework has , however , several drawbacks @xcite and , more importantly , it fails to account for the existence of the recently discovered 125 gev higgs - like particle @xcite . on the other hand , a 4th generation framework with two ( or more ) higgs doublets , such as the h4g2hdm discussed here , where the new heavy quarks have masses of @xmath15 ,",
    "is not only consistent with the current higgs data@xmath16}$ ] , but it can also have specific flavor structures , which may give rise to new signatures of 4th generation quarks at the lhc @xcite , and substantially relax the current bounds on their masses @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lightest higgs state in these class of models may be a good candidate for the recently discovered 125 gev higgs - like particle @xcite .",
    "we assume that the 4th generation quarks are charged under some new strong interaction that dynamically breaks ew symmetry ( see e.g. , the  top - color \" models of @xcite ) .",
    "the theory at the compositeness scale , @xmath3 , can then be parameterized by adding to the light sm degrees of freedom the following set of strongly coupled 4-fermi terms : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 stands for the bare sm lagrangian with a single fundamental higgs field , @xmath12 , which essentially parameterizes our ignorance as for the origin of mass for the lighter fermions .",
    "it is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and we use the superscript 0 to denote bare couplings at the scale @xmath3 .",
    "we can reproduce the theory defined by eq .",
    "[ 4fermi ] by introducing at @xmath3 an auxiliary higgs doublet , @xmath13 , which couples only to the 4th generation quarks as follows : @xmath23 for simplicity we did not write above the yukawa terms for the light and for the 4th generation leptons .",
    "in particular , our results are not sensitive to the choice by which the 4th generation leptons couple to the higgs sector ; they can either couple to the fundamental higgs or to the auxiliary field . in either case",
    ", we assume that their couplings are sub - critical and , therefore , do not play any role in dewsb ( see also discussion below ) .",
    "the scalar sector of the full theory at the compositeness scale is , therefore , described by : @xmath24 where we have added a @xmath25 mixing term @xmath26 , which may arise e.g. , from qcd - like instanton effects associated with the underlying strong dynamics ( see e.g. , @xcite ) or from sub - critical couplings of the fundamental higgs to the 4th generation quarks ( see below ) .",
    "this term explicitly breaks the @xmath27 peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite , which is otherwise possessed by the model , thus avoiding the presence of a massless pseudoscalar in the spectrum .",
    "note that , in any realistic scenario we expect @xmath28 and , since this is the only term which breaks the pq symmetry , it evolves only logarithmically under the rge so that , at the compositeness scale , we also have @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath30 , we expect @xmath31 .",
    "when the auxiliary ( composite ) field is integrated out at @xmath3 , we recover the lagrangian defined by eq .",
    "[ 4fermi ] , with @xmath32 plus additional interaction terms between the light higgs and the new heavy quarks with yukawa couplings of @xmath33 ; since at @xmath3 we have @xmath31 , such residual @xmath34 terms are expected to be small and will , therefore , not participate in ewsb .",
    "thus , from the point of view of dewsb , the hybrid 2hdm defined at @xmath3 , i.e. , with one fundamental and one auxiliary / composite scalar fields , is exactly equivalent to the theory defined in eq .",
    "[ 4fermi ] with the strong 4-fermi interactions of the 4th generation quarks .",
    "the auxiliary field , @xmath13 , is , therefore , viewed as a composite of the form @xmath35 , which is responsible for ewsb and for the dynamical mass generation of the heavy quarks . at low energies the field @xmath13 acquires a kinetic term as well as self interactions and the theory behaves as a 2hdm with a structure similar to the 4g2hdm proposed in @xcite , i.e. , one higgs field ( @xmath13 ) couples only to the heavy 4th generation quarks and the 2nd higgs field ( @xmath12 ) couples to the sm quarks of the 1st-3rd generations .",
    "the mass terms @xmath36 receive quantum corrections , resulting in ew - scale vev s for @xmath13 and for @xmath12 which break the ew symmetry .",
    "the resulting low - energy h4g2hdm scalar potential can be written as :    @xmath37    where all the above mass terms and quartic couplings run as a function of the energy scale @xmath38 , as dictated by the rge for this model.@xmath39}$ ] the stability condition for the above potential reads @xmath40 and @xmath41 . also , we apply the compositeness boundary conditions at the scale @xmath3 to the strong 4th generation yukawa couplings that generate the 4-fermi terms and to the quartic couplings involving the auxiliary field @xmath13 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",

    "[ gterms ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the quartic coupling of the fundamental higgs is unconstrained at @xmath3 , so that we have @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a free parameter of the model .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not required for our analysis , since we are only interested in their values at the ew - scale , which are fixed by the minimization conditions of the scalar - potential .",
    "in particular , at the minimum of the potential ( i.e. , at the ew - scale ) we can express @xmath48 and @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the quartic couplings @xmath53 ( neglecting @xmath54 and @xmath55 , see below ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and it is understood that the quartic couplings are evaluated at @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "[ cc ] , we find that @xmath61 is proportional only to the ( small ) gauge couplings , so that @xmath62 and can therefore be neglected .",
    "also , in our h4g2hdm , the rge for @xmath63 and for the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath64 are similar to the sm rge for these couplings . as for the rge for @xmath65 and for the yukawa couplings of the 4th generation quarks @xmath66",
    ", we can obtain a viable approximate analytic solution by neglecting the contributions from the running of the gauge couplings and the yukawa couplings of all light fermions , as well as the yukawa couplings of the 4th generation leptons .",
    "in particular , taking for simplicity @xmath67 , the dominant ( approximate ) rge in our h4g2hdm are given by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",

    "remarkably this is some fourteen orders of magnitudes smaller than the cutoff which emerges from a top - condensate scenario : @xmath78 gev , i.e. , obtained by solving the sm - like rge for @xmath64 : @xmath79 .",

    "now , since the physical higgs masses are sensitive to the energy scale at which the quartic couplings @xmath65 and @xmath63 are evaluated and since we do not apply the higgs threshold corrections when solving the rge , we need to estimate the errors on @xmath88 and on @xmath89 .",
    "we do so by computing the difference between the masses obtained with @xmath90 and with @xmath91 .",

    "<S> existing models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) find it very difficult to get a higgs of mass lighter than @xmath0 . consequently , in light of the lhc discovery of the @xmath1 gev higgs , such models face a significant obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , with three generations those models have a superheavy cut - off around @xmath2 gev , requiring a significant fine - tuning . to overcome these twin difficulties , we propose a hybrid framework for ewsb , in which the higgs mechanism is combined with a nambu - jona - lasinio mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the model introduces a strongly coupled doublet of heavy quarks with a mass around 500 gev , which forms a condensate at a compositeness scale @xmath3 about a few tev , and an additional unconstrained scalar doublet which behaves as a `` fundamental '' doublet at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this `` fundamental''-like doublet has a vanishing quartic term at @xmath3 and is , therefore , not the sm doublet , but should rather be viewed as a pseudo - goldstone boson of the underlying strong dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this setup is matched at the compositeness scale @xmath3 to a tightly constrained hybrid two higgs doublet model , where both the composite and unconstrained scalars participate in ewsb . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to get a good candidate for the recently observed 125 gev scalar which has properties very similar to the standard model higgs . </S>",
    "<S> the heavier ( mostly composite ) cp - even scalar has a mass around 500 gev , while the pseudoscalar and the charged higgs particles have masses in the range @xmath4 gev . </S>"
