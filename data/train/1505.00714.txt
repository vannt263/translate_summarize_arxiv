    "the _ axiverse _ scenario provides us with an interesting possibility to find evidence for string theories through observation in the cosmological and astrophysical contexts @xcite .",
    "string theories ( m theory ) are formulated in 10 ( 11 ) spacetime dimensions , and the extra dimensions should be compactified to realize our four spacetime dimensions .",
    "many moduli appear as a result and some of them are expected to behave as ( pseudo-)scalar fields with tiny masses from four - dimensional point of view .",
    "although such exotic fields are in hidden sector , we may detect signals from such fundamental fields through weak coupling to standard model matter / fields or through coupling to gravity ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "if such a scalar field with tiny mass exists in nature , what happens around a black hole ? if the black hole is rotating , there is an ergoregion around the event horizon where the time - translation killing vector @xmath0 becomes spacelike .",
    "because of this property , the spatial density of the killing energy with respect to @xmath0 of the scalar field can become negative in the ergoregion , although the local proper energy density with respect to a time - like vector is always positive if the dominant energy condition is satisfied .",
    "the killing energy density becomes negative when the superradiant condition , in , is satisfied .",
    "hence , for a quasibound state mode satisfying the superradiant condition , the killing energy flux towards the horizon becomes negative .",
    "because the total killing energy is conserved and represents the total energy of the system measured by an observer at spatial infinity , this implies that the field outside the ergoregion grows exponentially .",
    "this is called the _",
    "`` superradiant instability '' _ , and it is one of the methods to extract energy from a rotating black hole analogous to the famous penrose process .",
    "the superradiant instability effectively happens if the compton wavelength of the axion mass @xmath1 has the order of the gravitational radius of a black hole , and its typical time scale is about one minute for a solar - mass black hole , and about one year for an intermediate scale massive black hole such as the sgr a@xmath2 at the centre of our galaxy .",
    "the superradiant instability was studied also before the appearance of the axiverse scenario by theoretical motivations @xcite ( see also @xcite for recent works and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the axiverse scenario has provoked renewed interests in this topic because it suggests that the superradiant instability may happen in our real universe , and furthermore , signals from an axion field may be observed by gravitational wave detectors .",
    "if we take account of the possibility that astrophysical black holes wear clouds of a string axion field , there are many issues to be studied . up to now , some work has been done including simulations of scalar field as a test field @xcite , properties of gravitational wave emissions @xcite , simulations including gravitational backreactions @xcite , the evolution of black hole parameters @xcite , and so on .",
    "our primary interest in the present paper is the effect of the nonlinear self - interaction of the axionic scalar field and its impact on the gravitational wave emission . here",
    ", the nonlinear self - interaction means that the potential of the axion field becomes periodic , typically described as @xmath3 .",
    "\\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ] this type of the potential arises by the nonperturbative effect for the qcd axion , and a similar mechanism is expected to work also for a string axion . in our previous paper @xcite , we performed numerical simulations of a scalar field with the potential , i.e. , the sine - gordon field , as a test field in the kerr background spacetime for a specific choice of system parameters .",
    "there , we numerically demonstrated that the self - interaction causes gradual concentration of the axion field configuration with its superradiant growth and eventually leads to a dynamical collapse of the configuration associated with an infall of positive energy towards the black hole and an outflow towards the far region .",
    "we call this violent phenomenon the",
    "_ `` bosenova '' _ in analogy with the bosenova explosion observed in experiments of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "summarizes the overall picture of phenomena in the time evolution of an axion cloud with the self - interaction suggested from our previous results  @xcite . in the first stage , the energy exponentially grows by the superradiant instability . at some energy for which the field amplitude becomes @xmath4 ,",
    "the nonlinear self - interaction becomes important and causes a sudden collapse of the cloud followed by the infall of the positive energy to the black hole and an outflow towards the far region .",
    "this bosenova event continues for a period @xmath5 , and then , the system settles to the superradiant phase again .",
    "bosenova typically happens when the axion cloud extracts a tiny portion of the black hole rotation energy .",
    "after that , bosenova and superradiant growth happen alternatively . during each bosenova event , the energy extraction from the black hole effectively stops , and instead",
    ", a part of the axion cloud energy extracted from the black hole in the precedent superradiant phase is put back to the black hole .",
    "thus , some part of the rotation energy extracted from the black hole is recycled . in the meantine",
    ", bosenova is expected to generate burst - type gravitational waves .",
    "further , continuous gravitational waves are generated by oscillation of the axion field .",
    "thus , the long - time evolution of the black hole is determined by the energy loss by these gravitational wave emissions , if the interaction with surrounding plasma and magnetic fields are neglected .    in the present paper , we explore these processes more deeply . in particular , we focus our attention to the following three problems .",
    "first , we revisit the calculation of the superradiant growth rates of the quasibound states of a massive klein - gordon field ( without nonlinear self - interaction ) .",
    "although several calculations have been performed for the fundamental modes ( i.e. , the modes with zero radial quantum number ) , to our knowledge no report has been made for overtone modes ( i.e. , modes with nonzero radial quantum number ) . using the leaver s method @xcite , we show that there are some cases where an overtone mode has the largest growth rate , and thus , consists of the primary component of the axion cloud , depending on the system parameters and the angular quantum numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in order to prove that this result is not produced by a mode confusion or an error",
    ", we check our results by highly accurate time - domain simulations .",
    "next , we extend our simulations on bosenova in our previous paper  @xcite , which dealt with the case with a single unstable mode of a specific type initially , to a wider class of initial conditions and to more complicated situations . to be specific , we perform simulations for several axion mass values and mode parameters different from that in @xcite . for an axion cloud in the @xmath8 mode ,",
    "our results indicate the possibility that the bosenova collapse does not happen in contrast to the @xmath9 case . instead , a steady outflow of the axion field will be formed at the end point of the superradiant instability .",
    "we also study the effects of nonlinearity in the case that two unstable modes are excited .    finally , we address the problem of gravitational wave emissions from the axion cloud . in our previous papers",
    "@xcite , we calculated the amplitudes of continuous gravitational waves emitted from this system ignoring the nonlinear self - interaction ( i.e. , from quasi - bound states of massive klein - gordon field ) and discussed their observational consequences .",
    "the next step is to calculate the emission of gravitational waves from a dynamical axion cloud in the presence of nonlinear self - interaction .",
    "because we already have the time - domain data of the dynamical evolution of the scalar field , the main task is to solve the perturbation equations for the gravitational field with the prescribed source term in the kerr background .",
    "we attack this problem by solving the teukolsky master equation in the time domain . at this moment of time",
    ", we have finished developing a code to simulate gravitational waves generated by a scalar field in a schwarzschild spacetime , and the extension to the kerr case is still under progress . in the present paper ,",
    "we report the results of test simulations for gravitational wave emissions from quasibound states of a massive scalar field with self - interaction around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "although this is an artificial setup in the sense that this system does not cause the superradiant instability and the initial configuration is prepared by hand , we can obtain a lot of implications for gravitational waves emitted during the realistic bosenova .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly overview the basics of axions including both qcd and string axions from the effective field theory point of view , and thereby explain the meaning of the basic axion parameters and the origin of the axion potential .",
    "then , in , after briefly overviewing the basics of superradiant instability and the method to evaluate the instability growth rate , we show our numerical results on the growth rates of the axion cloud by superradiant instability taking attention to overtone modes . in , we study the effects of the nonlinear self - interaction on the basis of the results of our simulations . in",
    ", we explain our approach for calculating gravitational waves emitted from the axion cloud around a kerr black hole , and show preliminary results of our simulations in the case of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "is devoted to a summary and discussions . in [ appendix : a ] , a supplementary explanation on the pseudospectral method for calculating scalar field behaviour is given .",
    "in [ appendix : b ] , we give the supplementary informations on the gravitational wave calculation .",
    "in this section , we briefly overview basic features of axion on the basis of model - independent arguments in order to explain the meaning of the axion parameters and the origin of self - interactions .      in this paper",
    ", we define an axion as a goldstone field / boson associated with a spontaneous breaking of a chiral shift or @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "let us denote such a chiral transformation with the angle parameter @xmath11 by @xmath12 symbolically . then , when this symmetry is spontaneously broken , the associated goldstone field @xmath13 transforms as @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant called the _ axion decay constant _ in analogy with the pion decay constant @xmath16 for the pion fields as the pseudo - goldstone fields for the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the axion decay constant is normalized by the condition that @xmath13 has the canonical kinetic term @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and that @xmath11 has the period @xmath20 .",
    "a symmetry is chiral when it transforms fields with distinction of left and right components asymmetrically . in four spacetime dimensions ,",
    "spinor fields are the only fields with chirality .",
    "such a chiral transformation can be generally written @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a hermitian matrix characterizing the transformation . in higher dimensions",
    ", bosonic fields can have a chirality .",
    "an important example is the 5-form flux in the type iib supergravity in 10 spacetime dimensions .    in four spacetime dimensions ,",
    "this invariance determines the coupling of the axion field to the spinor fields uniquely in the leading order as follows .",
    "first , because the action of the system is invariant under the chiral transformation , the transformation of the spinor fields with fixed @xmath13 produces the same change in the action as the transformation @xmath23 with fixed @xmath24 when @xmath11 is a constant parameter .",
    "hence , if we redefine @xmath24 by with @xmath11 replaced by the field @xmath25 , then @xmath13 disappears from the terms that do not contain a derivative of @xmath24 .",
    "however , the kinetic term of the spinor fields produces a new term as @xmath26 from this , it follows that after the redefinition of the spinor field with @xmath25 , the @xmath13-dependent part of the lagrangian is given by @xmath27 if the lagrangian does not contain a derivative term of @xmath24 of higher dimensions . in this new representation ,",
    "the chiral transformation does not act on the spinor field @xmath24 and just shift the axion field .",
    "the action is not correct in quantum theory .",
    "it is because due to the chiral anomaly , the effective lagrangian transforms as in this expression , the left and right chirality components of the spinor fields are treated as independent field components . ]",
    "@xmath28 where we have used the notation in which the coupling of the gauge field @xmath29 to the fermion reads @xmath30 and the gauge kinetic term can be written @xmath31 here , it is understood that the index @xmath32 runs over all the components of all gauge fields .",
    "so , the gauge coupling constants @xmath33 whose index belongs to the same gauge group should be identical .",
    "when we generalize the transformation to a local transformation with @xmath34 , because of the shift symmetry of the original lagrangian , the effective lagrangian changes as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the current corresponding to the chiral transformation @xmath37 . in the path - integral expression for the partition function @xmath38 of the system , this change is produced just by the variable redefinition corresponding to the local chiral transformation : @xmath39 \\rme^{\\rmi s } = \\int [ \\rmd\\psi ' \\rmd\\bar{\\psi}'\\cdots ] \\rme^{\\rmi s ' } = \\int [ \\rmd\\psi \\rmd\\bar{\\psi } \\cdots ] \\rme^{\\rmi(s + \\delta s)}.\\ ] ] hence , its expectation value has to vanish : @xmath40 this modification of the conservation law for the chiral current can be made consistent with the field equations by adding the term @xmath41 to the tree level lagrangian . by this modification",
    ", the additional change of the effective action due to the chiral anomaly is reproduced in the tree level .",
    "thus , generalizing to the multiple axion case and including the gravitational chern - simons ( cs ) term from the chiral anomaly , we obtain the following general effective action for axions : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the matrix defining the chiral transformation @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the corresponding axion field and @xmath46 . in the multi axion case",
    ", the kinetic term of the axion fields may not be diagonalized if @xmath47 depends on other fields . in that case , the definition of the axion decay constant @xmath48 become ambiguous . here , note that if the chiral transformations @xmath44 commute with the gauge transformations , @xmath49 vanishes unless both @xmath32 and @xmath50 belong to abelian factors or to the same non - abelian factor of the full gauge group because @xmath51 for any gauge transformation @xmath52 . hence , for axions ,",
    "@xmath53 except for the indices @xmath32 and @xmath50 belonging to @xmath10 factors of the full gauge group .",
    "if we consider a pseudo - goldstone boson associated with an approximate symmetry , this rule does not apply and a mixing between a non - abelian gauge field and an abelian or non - abelian gauge field can appear in the cs terms .",
    "the most famous example of such mixing is the cs term proportional to @xmath54 giving the main decay channel @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the em field .",
    "this term arises because @xmath57 is a pseudo - goldstone boson associated with the approximate chiral @xmath17 symmetry in the @xmath58 quark sector . in this chiral dynamics approach",
    ", @xmath57 corresponds to the same transformation matrix @xmath59(=the pauli matrix @xmath60 ) as that for the third component of the weak @xmath17 gauge field , and @xmath61 .",
    "this produces the cs coupling of @xmath57 to the em field and the @xmath38 boson field .",
    "as we saw above , the lagrangian of axions taking account of perturbative quantum corrections can be determined uniquely by the structure of the associated chiral transformations , or equivalently by the chiral currents @xmath62 , except for the kinetic metric @xmath47 and axion decay constants @xmath48 .",
    "this kinetic metric and @xmath48 are independent of the axion fields but may depend on other fields and sensitive to the kinetic structure of the boson sector of the original theory .    in this perturbative level",
    ", the theory preserves the shift symmetries exactly .",
    "in particular , there appears no mass term or potential for axions .",
    "when non - perturbative effects of non - abelian gauge fields in strong coupling regions or stringy instantons are taken into account , however , the system acquires a non - trivial potential and as a consequence , the shift symmetries are broken to discrete symmetries . although the exact calculation of these non - perturbative effects are out of our reach , they are usually estimated by the two methods @xcite : the instanton approach and the effective lagrangian approach for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we first discuss non - perturbative effects of gauge field instantons .",
    "when the axion fields are uniform , the cs action for a @xmath63 gauge field @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 is a topological quantity proportional to the 1st pontrjagin number @xmath67 of the gauge bundle , where @xmath68 is expressed in terms of some constant @xmath69 and the axion fields as @xmath70 in the lorentzian spacetime , there exists no classical solution for which @xmath67 is bounded , while in the euclidean space obtained by the wick rotation , there may exist a classical solution with finite @xmath67 .",
    "such a solution is called an instanton and give a non - trial contribution in the euclidian path integral formulation .",
    "topologically , instanton solutions in four dimensions are classified by @xmath71 .",
    "because @xmath72 , there exists no instanton for an abelian field , hence the cs term induces no potential .",
    "in contrast , because @xmath73(@xmath74 ) , all non - abelian @xmath75 gauge field has instanton solutions topologically classified by the instanton number @xmath76 . among these solutions ,",
    "those with self - dual or anti - self - dual field strength have the least action for a given instanton number , hence give the dominant contribution in the path integral .",
    "explicit solutions are known for some cases .",
    "the most famous one is the self - dual bpst solution with @xmath77 for the @xmath17 gauge field , which is also an instanton solution for the @xmath75 gauge field with @xmath78 by the standard inclusion @xmath79 .",
    "because the bpst solution has the moduli freedom corresponding to the spacetime translation and the dilation , its contribution to the partition function @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is some mass scale and @xmath82 is the size of the instanton .",
    "for the self - dual solution , the euclidian instanton action @xmath83 is determined by the coupling constant and the instanton number as @xmath84 if we assume that a general instanton solution with @xmath85 can be approximated by the linear superpositions of @xmath86 bpst solutions and of @xmath87 anti - bpst solutions with @xmath88 ( _ the dilute gas approximation _ ) , the total contribution of the instantons to @xmath38 can be written @xmath89.\\ ] ] hence , the instantons produces the non - perturbative potential @xmath90 where @xmath91    from this formal expression , we see that instantons with large size @xmath82 produces large contribution if the gauge field becomes strongly coupled in the ir region , but we can not calculate this strong coupling effect properly . in the qcd axion case , @xmath92 is of the order of the pion mass as we see below . in the case",
    "in which there exists more than one gauge fields with strong coupling regions , the axion potential is given by the sum of the contributions from all such gauge fields .",
    "thus , generically , the potential is given by @xmath93 here , @xmath94 s are phases determined by the cp phase of the fermion mass matrix and the @xmath68-angle of the vacuum of each non - abelian gauge field .    note that if the number @xmath95 of independent axions is smaller than the number @xmath96 of strongly coupled gauge fields , some of @xmath94 s may not be set to zero by the constant shift of the axion fields . in this case ,",
    "cp invariance is not recovered in some gauge sector by the peccei - quinn type mechanism .",
    "in particular , a strongly coupled gauge field in the hidden sector may interfere the qcd sector to cause a cp violation larger than the experimental upper limit .",
    "in contrast , in the case @xmath97 , @xmath94 can be always set to zero by shifts of the axion fields as far as the effects of instantons of four - dimensional gauge fields are taken into account .",
    "however , these residual shift symmetries may be broken by stringy effects as discussed below .",
    "the masses of the axions can be calculated by expanding @xmath98 with @xmath99 with respect to @xmath45 and diagonalizing the quadratic terms @xmath100 from this expression , we see that the axion mass is roughly given by @xmath101 where @xmath92 is the largest strong coupling energy scale of the gauge fields coupled to the axion and @xmath15 is the axion decay constant",
    ".    another important consequence of this formula is that if @xmath102 , @xmath103 axions should be massless .",
    "this problem is serious for the axiverse scenario because @xmath96 can not be become so large .",
    "we can easily show that the kinematic mixing of the axions does not change the situation .",
    "this problem can be avoided if we take into account string instanton effects    the second method to estimate the non - perturbative effects is to use the effective field theory for composite mesons corresponding to the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with a spontaneous breaking of non - anomalous approximate chiral symmetry .",
    "for example , let us consider the chiral @xmath17 symmetry of the qcd system with two quarks @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "first , let us move the @xmath68 phase for the color @xmath106 gauge field to the quark mass matrix sector by the chiral transformation @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "then , the quark mass terms changes as @xmath109 and the kinetic term of the quarks produces the additional axion quark coupling @xmath110 now , in the strong coupling regime , the products of quark fields acquire non - vanishing vacuum expectation values as @xmath111 where @xmath57 is the field of the neutral pion and @xmath112 is the pion decay constant",
    ". then , the quark mass term produces the potential @xmath113 and the derivative coupling between the axions and quarks gives rise to the axion-@xmath57 kinetic mixing @xmath114 where we have set @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    in the case of a single axion , which is supposed to be the qcd axion ,",
    "the value of @xmath117 is uniquely determined by the requirements that @xmath118 and that this axion - pion mixing disappears .",
    "then , from @xmath119 , we obtain the standard formula for the axion mass and the pion mass in terms of @xmath120 : @xmath121 where we have assumed the invisible axion condition @xmath122 .",
    "in contrast , if two or more axions couple to the color @xmath106 gauge fields or the quarks @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we can not eliminate the @xmath57-axion mixing by the choice of @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this mixing , however , can be eliminated by just shifting the axion fields other than the qcd axion by some constant multiple of @xmath57 field .",
    "thus , the axion - pion mixing does not provide additional mass to axions other than the qcd axion , and just yield a tiny correction to the @xmath57 mass .",
    "actually , we can show that the kinetic mixing between axions and mesons does not change the number of massless axions .    .",
    "the cmb experiments pixie @xcite / prism@xcite and the axion helio scope experiment iaxo @xcite utilize the cs coupling of an axion to the em field , @xmath125 .",
    "hence , they do not directly give constraints on @xmath15 .",
    "in this figure , we have translated the expected sensitivity on @xmath126 to the constraint on @xmath15 by the relation @xmath127 .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]      in string theory , the compactification of extra dimensions can produce a large number of axions if the internal space has a rich topological structure .",
    "this is because the generalized gauge symmetry for form fields contained in the original ten or eleven dimensional supergravity turn to a shift symmetry of zero modes .",
    "as an example , let us take up the rr 2-form field @xmath128 in the type iib supergravity in ten - dimensional spacetime .",
    "when it is compactified to the product of a four - dimensional spacetime @xmath129 and a six - dimensional calabi - yau manifold @xmath130 , the zero mode of @xmath131 can be expanded in terms of harmonic 2-forms @xmath132 on @xmath130 up to the gauge transformation @xmath133 as @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are a 2-form and functions on @xmath129 , respectively . because a closed form is locally exact , the theory is also invariant under a transformation @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is an arbitrary closed form .",
    "this implies that the theory is invariant under the shift of the fields , @xmath139 with @xmath140 being constants .",
    "further , we can confirm that the term of the form @xmath141 appears in the effective four - dimensional theory after compactification , where @xmath142 s are spinor fields on @xmath129 corresponding to the zero modes of the gravitino field in the internal directions and the dilatino field on @xmath130 .",
    "this implies that the current of this shift symmetry @xmath143 is chiral , and @xmath45 s become axion fields according to the general arguments in the previous subsections .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath144 axions from @xmath131 , where @xmath145 is the second betti number .    in the original type iib theory , there exists no matter gauge fields , and no cs term appears .",
    "however , if we introduce d - branes , the cs d - brane action @xcite @xmath146 produces the cs interaction of the axions to gauge fields and the gravitational field on the branes after compactification .",
    "this is natural because this cs action is obtained from the anomaly free condition .",
    "all string axions should be described by the effective theory in four dimensions explained in the previous subsections . in particular , their roles in cosmophysical phenomena and experiments",
    "are essentially determined by its mass @xmath147 and axion decay constant @xmath48(see ) @xcite .",
    "we can probe the compactification structure and string theory behind it mainly through the distribution of the values of these quantities .    from the perspective of searching phenomena that may be caused by axions",
    ", it is important to know plausible predictions of theory on the parameter distribution . as we mentioned in the previous subsection",
    ", we can give non - perturbative mass by instanton effects of low energy gauge fields only to @xmath96 axions where @xmath96 is the number of gauge fields with strong coupling regimes including those in the hidden sector .",
    "hence , in the axiverse perspective , most of string axions get mass by string or brane instanton effects . in this case , in the mass formula @xmath148 , @xmath15 is generally given by @xmath149 , and @xmath150 where @xmath83 is the instanton euclidean action .",
    "svrcek and witten estimated @xmath83 by considering the interference of string axions to the qcd theta phase and obtained the constraint @xmath151 , i.e. @xmath152 . on the basis of this result , the axiverse paper @xcite argued that @xmath153 is distributed uniformly with respect to @xmath154 because @xmath155 .    as we have shown in , various experiments that may detect axions or provide constraints on the axion parameters are planned .",
    "these experiments , however , require a sufficient abundance of axions or rather strong coupling of axions and photons , hence a rather small value for the axion decay constant .",
    "in contrast , the superradiant instability of an axion field around a rotating black hole that we discuss in the present paper does not require any abundance because the seed can be zero point oscillations of the axion field .",
    "further , the phenomena caused by the instability becomes more violent and energetic for a larger @xmath15 as we will see .",
    "hence , this phenomenon enables us to probe the parameter region complimentary to other experiments .",

    "first , we compared our numerical data with those obtained by dolan @xcite for the case @xmath206 .",
    "the two results agree very well .",
    "next , we calculated the time evolution of the quasibound states for the situation where the growth rate of @xmath236 is larger than that of @xmath206 , starting with the initial data generated by the leaver s method . as an example",

    "when the amount of the axion cloud energy is small , the nonlinear effect is not important and the axion cloud grows by the superradiant instability . as the nonlinear effect becomes important , the scattering towards the far region gradually occurs , while the extraction of the energy from the black hole continues . at some energy , the scattering rate of energy to the distant region and the rate of the energy extraction from the black hole would balance , and",
    "the final state would not be the bosenova collapse , but rather a steady outflow of the field from the axion cloud .",
    "this steady state should be realized before the axion cloud energy reaches the energy amount in the simulation here , that is , @xmath403 .",

    "this procedure is necessary to predict the observed gravitational wave forms and is under progress .",
    "although we do not know the exact waveform , a rough estimate on the detectability of the gravitational wave burst emitted during the bosenova can be given as follows .",
    "let us consider the case where the black hole candidate , cygnus x-1 , wears a cloud of axion scalar field with mass @xmath552 , which corresponds to @xmath553 .",
    "up to the bosenova , the gravitational waves show exponential growth with keeping @xmath536 that corresponds to @xmath554 , and there is a period @xmath555 during which the gravitational amplitude is larger than the klein - gordon case by a factor of @xmath556 or more . on the other hand , in our previous paper @xcite we calculated the amplitude of continuous gravitational waves from cygnus x-1 in the case that it wears the quasibound state of a klein - gordon field , using the black hole parameters determined by observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , the gravitational wave amplitude from the bosenova is obtained just by multiplying @xmath557 to our previous estimate for the klein - gordon case .",
    "the result is @xmath558 after substituting the mass @xmath158 , the distance @xmath105 , and axion mass @xmath1 .",
    "then , multiplying @xmath559 , the strain amplitude becomes @xmath560 .",
    "this is about @xmath545 times larger than the observation threshold of ligo if the gut scale decay constant is adopted .",
    "this shows the possible detectability of gravitational waves from the bosenova .    here",
    ", we note that the reliability of the estimate here based on the schwarzschild case may be questioned , because there is difference between the bosenovae in the schwarzschild case and the kerr case . in the kerr case",
    ", the infall of positive energy happens as a result of excitation of @xmath327 mode , and it is a slower process compared to the schwarzschild case .",
    "this may affect the amplitude of gravitational wave burst during the bosenova .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to extend our code to the kerr background case in order to make our calculations more realistic and to enable our simulation results applicable to observational data analysis .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the three features of time evolution of an axion cloud around a rotating black hole by numerical calculations / simulations . in the superradiant phase",
    ", we calculated the growth rate by the superradiant instability without self - interaction ( i.e. , a the massive klein - gordon field ) including the overtone modes as well as the fundamental modes ( ) .",
    "our results indicate that for @xmath243 , the overtone modes can have larger growth rates compared to the fundamental mode when the black hole is rapidly rotating . in , we studied the phase where the nonlinear self - interaction becomes important by simulating the behaviour of the scalar field numerically .",
    "the bosenova collapse happens for @xmath9 mode , and it becomes more violent as @xmath200 is decreased . for @xmath8 mode , our simulation results suggest that the bosenova collapse would not happen , but a steady outflow will be formed instead . if we consider superposition of two modes , further rich phenomena were observed . in",
    ", we showed our preliminary simulations of gravitational wave emission from an axion cloud in the presence of axion nonlinear self - interaction around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "although the extension to the kerr case is necessary , we have obtained a lot of indications for these phenomena . in particular ,",
    "gravitational wave burst is emitted when the scalar field collapse to a black hole .",
    "more detailed summary and discussion are given at the end of each section .",
    "up to now , we took attention to the phenomena that happens in the initial phase ( superradiant instability ) or in the time scale of @xmath561 after that ( bosenovae and gravitational wave emission ) . in",
    "what follows , we consider the evolution of an axion cloud and a black hole in a longer time scale . in a long time scale , the black hole parameters @xmath158 and",
    "@xmath562 change in time due to the backreaction of energy / angular momentum extraction by the axion cloud .",
    "the evolution of the black hole parameters was discussed in the original axiverse papers @xcite , and the more detailed adiabatic evolution was calculated in @xcite , taking account of the supply of energy / angular momentum by the accretion disk , the energy / angular momentum extraction by the scalar cloud , and the loss of the energy / angular momentum of the axion cloud by the gravitational wave emission . when the superradiant instability becomes important as the black hole",
    "is spun up by the accretion disk , the scalar cloud rapidly grows to decrease the black hole spin parameter @xmath199 to the marginal value satisfying @xmath563 .",
    "after that , the spin parameter gradually grows due to the effect of the accretion disk .",
    "if we switch on the self - interaction effect , the nonlinear effect becomes significant when the axion field becomes order of the decay constant , @xmath564 , and the axion cloud energy at this time is @xmath565 . for @xmath15 with the gut scale ( @xmath566 of the gut scale )",
    ", the corresponding energy is @xmath567 ( @xmath568 ) of the black hole mass .",
    "therefore , the evolution is expected to highly depend on the value of @xmath15 , and the scenario would become different from the ones in @xcite .",
    "one important additional quantity in the presence of the nonlinear self - interaction is the energy / angular momentum loss rates of the axion cloud by the bosenova ( @xmath9 case ) or the axion outflow ( @xmath569 case ) .",
    "since the direct approach is very difficult because the nonlinear self - interaction makes the system highly dynamical , one has to consider an effective approximation . if we take an average over the timescale much longer than the bosenova occurrence , the energy / angular momentum of the gravitationally bounded axion field would be approximately constant , whose values depend only on @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the decrease in the energy / angular momentum of the black hole due to the superradiant instability in short time scales will be erased out after the averaging because of the recycling processes by the bosenova .",

    "<S> next , we study the dynamical evolution of the scalar field caused by the nonlinear self - interaction , taking attention to the dependence of the dynamical phenomena on the axion mass and the modes . the cases in which two superradiantly unstable modes are excited simultaneously are also studied . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we report on our preliminary simulations for gravitational wave emission from the dynamical axion cloud in the schwarzschild background approximation . </S>",
