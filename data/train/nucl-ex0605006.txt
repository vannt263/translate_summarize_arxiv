    "the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon has long been a topic of fundamental interest in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "first - order nucleon electromagnetic properties are commonly parameterized in terms of elastic form factors @xcite . at low values of four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath2 , these functions have a simple interpretation as the fourier transforms of the nucleon charge and magnetization densities in the breit frame .",
    "their precise experimental determination is important both for testing fundamental theories of hadron structure and for the analysis of other experiments in the field , such as parity violation measurements  @xcite that are designed to probe the strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "the proton form factors have been determined with good precision at low @xmath2 using rosenbluth separation of elastic electron - proton cross sections , and more recently at higher @xmath2 using a polarization transfer technique  @xcite .",
    "the neutron form factors are known less well because of the zero electric charge of the neutron , causing its electric form factor to be small , and experimental complications such as the lack of free neutron targets and difficulties associated with neutron detectors .    over the past two decades , with the advent of much improved experimental facilities , the precise measurement of both the neutron electric form factor , @xmath5 , and the magnetic form factor , @xmath4 , has become a focus of activity . until recently",
    ", most data on @xmath4 had been deduced from elastic and quasi - elastic electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "inclusive measurements of this type suffer from large theoretical uncertainties due in part to the deuteron model employed and in part to corrections for final - state interactions ( fsi ) and meson - exchange currents ( mec ) .",
    "the sensitivity to nuclear structure is reduced by measuring the neutron in coincidence , @xmath3h@xmath6 @xcite , and , further , by taking the ratio of cross sections of @xmath3h@xmath6 to @xmath3h@xmath7 at quasi - elastic kinematics @xcite .",
    "uncertainties of less than 2% in @xmath4 have been achieved in the region @xmath8  ( gev / c)@xmath3 using the latter technique @xcite . despite this high precision",
    ", there is significant disagreement between the results of @xcite and those of the more recent experiments @xcite of up to 10% in the absolute value of @xmath4 .",
    "an explanation has been suggested in @xcite , but the issue has remained contentious .",
    "to clarify the situation experimentally , additional data on @xmath4 , preferably obtained using a complementary method , are highly desirable .",
    "inclusive quasi - elastic @xmath1 scattering provides such an alternative approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast to deuterium experiments , this technique employs a different target and relies on polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "it is thus subject to completely different systematics . on the other hand , due to the more complex physics of the three - body system",
    ", the precise extraction of nucleon form factors from polarized @xmath9he measurements requires careful modeling of the nuclear structure and of the reaction mechanism .",
    "recent advances in faddeev calculations @xcite have brought theoretical uncertainties of @xmath9he models sufficiently under control to allow such studies in the non - relativistic kinematic regime .",
    "a precision comparable to that of the deuterium ratio experiments can be achieved using the polarized @xmath9he technique @xcite .",
    "the use of polarized @xmath9he targets was pioneered at mit - bates @xcite and mainz @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath4 was extracted for the first time from quasi - elastic inclusive scattering from polarized @xmath9he , although with a large statistical uncertainty .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the first precision measurement of the so - called transverse asymmetry @xmath0 , which is sensitive to @xmath4 , in the inclusive reaction @xmath1 .",
    "the results were obtained in hall a at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jefferson lab ) .",
    "brief reports of these data have appeared previously @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the data analysis and evaluation of model uncertainties in much more detail .",
    "in addition , the analysis has been slightly refined .",
    "the results presented here are final .",
    "the neutron magnetic form factor @xmath4 was extracted at @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( gev / c)@xmath3 in steps of 0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in addition , high - precision asymmetry data in the @xmath9he breakup region were obtained at @xmath2-values of 0.1 and 0.2 ( gev / c)@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the threshold data provide a stringent test of the above - mentioned faddeev calculations because they cover a kinematical region where the proper treatment of the reaction mechanism is particularly important .    at the @xmath10 and @xmath12 ( gev / c)@xmath3 kinematics ,",
    "@xmath4 was extracted using a state - of - the - art faddeev calculation @xcite .",
    "at these low @xmath2 , relativistic effects are small , and the non - relativistic faddeev results have been shown to be in good agreement with a diverse set of few - body data , including our own @xmath9he breakup threshold data @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the extraction of @xmath13 from our @xmath9he asymmetry data at higher values of @xmath2 with the same precision as that achieved at low @xmath2 would require a more advanced theory that includes both an accurate treatment of reaction mechanism effects ( fsi and mec ) and proper relativistic corrections ( and possibly other refinements , such as @xmath14-isobar excitations , presumed to be small at our kinematics ) .",
    "unfortunately , such a comprehensive calculation is not available at the present time , and efforts to extend the theory are only in the beginning stages .",
    "for example , full inclusion of fsi has been investigated for the two - body channel in @xcite .",
    "the hannover group has carried out a coupled - channel calculation of @xmath1 that accounts for fsi and @xmath14-isobars @xcite , unfortunately also with limited success at higher @xmath2 . nonetheless , we observe that the size of fsi and mec corrections to inclusive scattering data near the top of the quasi - elastic peak has been predicted to diminish sharply with increasing momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "hence , it appears likely that the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , in which the knocked - out nucleon is described by a plane wave while the spectator pair is fully interacting , is reasonably accurate at the higher @xmath2-values of this experiment . a quantitative estimate of the @xmath2-behavior of deviations from the pwia , in particular of the size of fsi corrections ,",
    "could be obtained by performing a @xmath15-scaling analysis on the present @xmath9he asymmetry data @xcite .",
    "such an analysis may be carried out in a future publication .",
    "taking the pragmatic point of view that the pwia is currently the best available theory describing inclusive quasi - elastic scattering from polarized @xmath9he at @xmath16  ( gev / c)@xmath3 , we have extracted @xmath13 from our higher @xmath2 data @xcite using pwia . while we do not attempt to go beyond the pwia by computing corrections for the various effects omitted in this approximation , we provide estimates of the uncertainties of the results in considerable detail . despite the relatively large theoretical uncertainties in this approach , our results are in good agreement with the recent deuterium ratio measurements from mainz @xcite in the same @xmath2-region .",
    "figure [ fig : scatt ] depicts inclusive scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from a polarized nuclear target .",
    "the four - momentum of the electrons before and after the reaction is @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the four - momentum transfer to the target is @xmath19 , with the usual definition @xmath20 .",
    "the experiment measured the spin - dependent asymmetry @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the differential cross section for quasi - elastic scattering of electrons with helicity @xmath23 from polarized @xmath9he .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of nuclear response functions , @xmath24 , and kinematic factors , @xmath25 , as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the target spin direction with respect to the three - momentum transfer vector , @xmath29 , as shown in figure  [ fig : scatt ] . by choosing @xmath27 = @xmath30 or @xmath31",
    ", one can select the transverse asymmetry , @xmath0 , or the longitudinal - transverse asymmetry , @xmath32 .",
    "the nuclear response functions for inclusive quasi - elastic scattering have been obtained through both pwia and faddeev calculations .",
    "these calculations will be discussed briefly next .      in the pwia , it is assumed that a single nucleon within the target nucleus completely absorbs the momentum of the virtual photon and leaves the interaction region as a plane wave .",
    "the remaining two - nucleon subsystem still undergoes interaction .",
    "exchange current effects are ignored .",
    "the target nucleus , in our case @xmath9he , however , is described by the solution of the schrdinger equation with realistic nuclear forces .",
    "relativistic effects are included by using relativistic energy conservation and a relativistic electron - nucleon cross section .",
    "the nuclear current tensor is calculated as the product of the nucleonic current tensor and the nuclear spectral function , which contains the nuclear structure information ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the spin - independent part of the spectral function has the well - known interpretation as the probability of finding a nucleon of certain momentum and isospin in the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "the pwia formalism available in the literature is largely but not necessarily fully covariant .",
    "expressions for the matrix elements of the nucleonic current tensor and the spin - dependent nuclear spectral function have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the spectral function can be computed numerically from the nuclear wave function , which in turn can be obtained from a model of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential . with the nucleonic current tensor and the nuclear spectral function at hand ,",
    "expressions for the functions @xmath24 , required in ( [ eq : asym ] ) , can be derived and evaluated numerically @xcite .",
    "the pwia results presented in the paper were calculated following @xcite .",
    "the calculation was based on a @xmath9he wave function derived from the argonne av18 nn potential @xcite and used the hhler nucleon form factor parameterization @xcite .          in the faddeev approach @xcite ,",
    "the coordinate - space schrdinger equation for three nucleons with two - nucleon interactions is decomposed into three separate equations @xcite . in momentum space ,",
    "the three faddeev equations can be written as three integral equations .",
    "the kernel in each equation involves only the interaction between one pair of the nucleons .",
    "solutions are obtained numerically .",
    "the faddeev decomposition of the three - body ( and four - body ) problem has proven to be a very useful computational tool in studies of light nuclei .    with regard to @xmath9he , the faddeev formalism has been applied to unpolarized @xmath33 and @xmath34 electrodisintegration @xcite with full inclusion of all final - state rescattering processes .",
    "this calculation was subsequently extended to electrodisintegration of polarized @xmath9he @xcite .",
    "a further extension was made by including proper treatment of meson - exchange currents @xcite according to the riska prescription @xcite , which relates nn forces and meson - exchange currents in a model - independent manner through the continuity equation . in @xcite ,",
    "only the dominant @xmath35- and @xmath36-like meson exchange terms shown in figure  [ fig : mec ] were considered .",
    "the effect of @xmath14 currents has also been studied and found to be small ( see section  [ sec : thresholdasym ] ) .",
    "the derivation of the nuclear response functions in the faddeev approach is described further in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the resulting expressions were evaluated numerically using the framework of @xcite for a large number of kinematical points corresponding to the acceptance regions covered by the experiment .",
    "the underlying @xmath9he wave function was obtained using the bonnb nn potential @xcite .",
    "again , the hhler parameterization @xcite was used to model the nucleon elastic form factors .",
    "the faddeev calculation does not include relativistic effects .      because the @xmath9he nuclear spin is carried mainly by the neutron , the spin - dependent response functions @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "can be expected to contain a large if not dominant neutron contribution at quasi - elastic kinematics @xcite .",
    "comparison of equation  ( [ eq : asym ] ) with the corresponding expression for scattering from a free nucleon leads to the expectation ( within pwia ) that @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the effective polarizations of the neutron and the protons , respectively , in @xmath9he . because the proton spins largely cancel , we have @xmath42 .",
    "effective polarizations have been calculated _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath43 , the proton contribution to the transverse response @xmath37 is small , and hence @xmath37 is essentially proportional to @xmath44 . based on these arguments , the asymmetry @xmath0 defined in ( [ eq : asym ] ) can be written as a function of the neutron magnetic form factor , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 at low @xmath2 where the above assumptions hold . by comparing @xmath0 data with predictions for @xmath0 from a calculation",
    ", one can extract @xmath4 .",
    "the detailed procedure will be discussed in section  [ sec : ffextraction ] .",
    "for completeness we mention that , because @xmath48 , the proton contribution to the transverse - longitudinal response , @xmath38 , may be dominant despite the small effective proton polarization .",
    "thus inclusive scattering from polarized @xmath9he is not a promising technique to measure the neutron electric form factor , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the experiment , e95 - 001 , was performed in hall a at jefferson lab using a continuous - wave electron beam of 15  @xmath49a current and 70% longitudinal polarization , incident on a high - pressure polarized @xmath9he gas target .",
    "the beam energies were 778 and 1727 mev .",
    "electrons scattered from the target were detected by two high - resolution spectrometers ( hrs ) positioned on the left and right - hand side of the beam line , respectively .",
    "both spectrometers were configured for electron detection and for independent operation ( single - arm mode ) .",
    "the `` electron spectrometer '' on the left side of the beam performed the main physics measurement of inclusive @xmath1 scattering at six different quasi - elastic kinematics .",
    "the second hrs , the `` hadron spectrometer '' to the right of the beam , detected @xmath50 elastic scattering and provided continuous high - precision monitoring of beam and target polarizations .",
    "the kinematic settings are listed in table  [ tab : kinematics ] .    electron arm ( quasi - elastic )    . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "numerical values for @xmath4 extracted in this work are given in table  [ tab : gmnresults ] ( in units of the empirical dipole parameterization , @xmath51 ) and shown in figure  [ fig : gmndata ] along with the existing world data set published since 1990 @xcite .",
    "the error bars represent the total uncertainties reported by the respective experiments , including model uncertainties .",
    "the results appear to be largely consistent , with the exception of the early @xmath3h@xmath6 data from bates @xcite and the first @xmath3h@xmath52h@xmath7 ratio measurement from bonn @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy of the data of these two experiments with the rest of the world data has been attributed to incomplete corrections for neutrons that miss the neutron detector @xcite .",
    "the data of the bonn experiment @xcite were re - analyzed subsequently @xcite , resulting in a downward correction of the @xmath4 data .",
    "figure  [ fig : gmndata ] shows the re - analyzed data .",
    "we note the satisfactory agreement between the more recent , high - precision deuterium ratio measurements @xcite and the data from this work .",
    "the agreement is well within the total uncertainties of the experiments , except at @xmath53 and @xmath11  ( gev / c)@xmath3 , where the @xmath9he results are low by about 5% .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : gmndata ] are several theoretical results : a recent dispersion - theoretical fit by hammer and meiner @xcite ( solid curve ) , a chiral soliton model by holzwarth @xcite ( dotted curve ) , a relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory calculation by kubis and meiner @xcite ( long - dashed curve ) , a vector meson dominance ( vmd ) fit by lomon @xcite ( dashed - dotted curve ) , and a recent light - front quark model by de melo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( short - dashed curve ) .",
    "it should be noted that all of these models contain one or more free parameters that have been fitted to existing data .",
    "as can be seen , the dispersion - theoretical fit @xcite and the vmd fit @xcite agree best with the data at @xmath54 ( gev / c)@xmath3 , while the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) results @xcite and the chiral soliton model @xcite match the data better at lower @xmath2 .",
    "the chpt model is expected to be good only up to @xmath55  ( gev / c)@xmath3 , but clearly works very well in its region of validity .",
    "the light - front model of de melo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite arguably shows the best overall agreement .",
    "the models by holzwarth @xcite , lomon @xcite , and de melo _",
    "_  @xcite also describe the proton form factor ratio @xmath56 and other elastic nucleon form factors well in this @xmath2-region .",
    "in conclusion , we have determined the neutron magnetic form factor @xmath4 from quasi - elastic @xmath1 data . at @xmath2 of 0.1 and 0.2 ( gev / c)@xmath3 ,",
    "we used a state - of - the - art faddeev calculation that includes fsi and mec , and pwia at four additional points between @xmath57 and 0.6 ( gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "the results agree within the total uncertainties with those obtained by several recent measurements on deuterium , except at @xmath53 and @xmath11 ( gev / c)@xmath3 where the @xmath9he results are slightly low . a consistent picture of the behavior of @xmath4 in this @xmath2-region is beginning to emerge , although further precision measurements as well as improved model calculations , such as the extension of the faddeev formalism to higher @xmath2 in the case of polarized @xmath58 , remain highly desirable .",
    "in addition , we have measured @xmath0 in the two- and three - body breakup threshold region at @xmath2 of 0.1 and 0.2 ( gev / c)@xmath3 where the sensitivity to fsi and mec effects is particularly high .",
    "the results agree well with the predictions of the faddeev model , especially at @xmath10  ( gev / c)@xmath3 , confirming the validity of the treatment of fsi and mec effects in this formalism .",
    "we thank the hall a technical staff and the jefferson lab accelerator division for their outstanding support during this experiment .",
