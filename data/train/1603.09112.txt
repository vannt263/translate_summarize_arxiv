    "heusler alloys are intermetallic compounds with interesting fundamental properties and possible practical applications .",
    "heusler alloys are typically known to be of two types : full - heusler alloys ( fha ) and half - heusler alloys ( hha ) .",
    "the full - heusler alloys , which are having a formula @xmath4 ( with a stoichiometry 2:1:1 , e.g. ni@xmath3mnga ) , commonly exhibit a @xmath5 structure .",
    "this has four interpenetrating face - centered ( fcc ) sub - lattices , for each of the atoms @xmath6(ni ) , @xmath6(ni ) , @xmath1(mn ) and @xmath2(ga ) .",
    "on the other hand , the half - heusler alloys with a formula @xmath7 ( with a stoichiometry 1:1:1 , e.g. nimnsb ) typically assume a @xmath8 structure where one of the four fcc sub - lattices remains unoccupied . since the discovery of the prototype fha , ni@xmath3mnga@xcite , various studies have been carried out which show that this alloy , having long - range ferromagnetic interaction , possesses various interesting physical properties .",
    "for example , ni@xmath3mnga exhibits magnetic field induced strain ( mfis ) and magnetic shape memory alloy ( msma ) property@xcite , magnetoresistance effect ( mre)@xcite as well as magnetocaloric effect ( mce)@xcite .",
    "the heusler alloys are interesting from both the points of view of possible technological application as well as fundamental science .",
    "hence , these have been enjoying the attention of the researchers - theoreticians and experimentalists alike .",
    "further , the basic drawbacks of the prototype heusler alloy , ni@xmath3mnga , in terms of technological application are its brittleness and the low martensite transition temperature . therefore , following the discovery of and studies on ni@xmath3mnga , various fhas have been synthesized , characterized and studied in the last two decades , as is observed in the literature .",
    "many new fha materials , till date , have been predicted from ab initio calculations as well .",
    "it has been observed that the face - centered - cubic phase is the high - temperature or the so - called austenite phase of these materials .",
    "some of these fhas has been seen to undergo a tetragonal distortion at a lower temperature .",
    "this first - order displacive transition , generally known as martensite transition , where the volumes of the unit cell of both the austenite and martensite phases are close to each other , is typically connected to the sma property exhibited by these alloys . among the fhas , in terms of the electronic structure ,",
    "there are various categories .",
    "while some of these alloys prefer to be metallic , some are found to be semiconducting , and some are having a large spin - polarization at the fermi level.@xcite    if the fhas are magnetic in nature , their properties can change when a magnetic field is applied which can be of interest in terms of potential technological application . hence , specially , magnetic shape memory alloys are gaining increasing interest . therefore",
    ", detailed studies of magnetic configurations , properties and interactions are of particular importance . in literature",
    ", various magnetic ground state configurations are observed in case of full - heusler alloys . while some alloys are even non - magnetic , many of these exhibit a long - range ferromagnetic ordering and are expected to show msma property . in many of these msmas , there is presence of a delocalized - like common d - band formed by the d - electrons of the @xmath6 and @xmath1 atoms , which are both typically first - row transition metal atoms.@xcite additionally , there is also an indirect rkky - type exchange mechanism@xcite , primarily mediated by the electrons of the @xmath2 atoms , which plays an important role in defining the magnetic properties of these materials.@xcite further",
    ", it has also been observed that some of these alloys including mn@xmath3niga even show long - range ferrimagnetism and also anti - ferromagnetism.@xcite    hence , it is clear from the literature , that in terms of different physical , including , structural ( mechanical ) , electronic and magnetic properties , the full - heusler alloys show a rich variety .",
    "further , as has been mentioned above , it has been of particular interest that out of all the full - heusler alloys , only a few undergo the martensite transition .",
    "these alloys are prone to a cubic to tetragonal distortion when temperature is lowered and generally exhibit the technologically important sma property .",
    "these fhas in general are found to be metallic in nature . on the other hand",
    ", it has been observed that there is another group of full - heusler alloys which are half - metallic - like in nature , with a much reduced density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level in case of one of the spin channels .",
    "these materials generally do not show the tendency of undergoing a tetragonal distortion and also showing the sma property .",
    "however , an application in the field of spintronics is a possibility for these materials . from both the points of view of fundamental understanding as well as technological application",
    ", it can be interesting to probe the similarities and differences in magnetic , bulk mechanical , and electronic properties of these two categories of materials .",
    "it will also be interesting to see if there is any fha which has a tendency to undergo a tetragonal transition and at the same time possesses a high spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "keeping this in mind , in the present paper , we probe the magnetic , bulk mechanical , and electronic properties of a series of ni and co - based full heusler alloys using density functional theory ( dft ) based ab initio calculations .",
    "the choice of these two systems ( ni and co - based fhas ) is due to the following facts .",
    "first and foremost , it has been seen that typically , a large amount of work on the fhas are on ni and co - based compounds .",
    "it is also seen in the literature that while most of the ni - based fhas show msma property , many of the co - based fhas exhibit large spin - polarization at the fermi level .",
    "it has also been pointed out in the literature , that while the magnetic interactions are somewhat different in the ni and co - based fhas , the total energy variation for an austenite to martensite phase transition is similar.@xcite hence , a comparative study may be interesting and also important for detailed understanding of the properties of these alloys .",
    "the primary interest is to study the possibility of the tetragonal transition versus a high spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "further , we look for ferromagnetic materials so that realization of msma property is possible . in what follows , first , we give a brief account of the methods we used and then we present the results and discussion . in the end , the results of this work are summarized and conclusions are drawn .",
    "the full - heusler alloys , as for example , ni@xmath3mnga , commonly assume an ordered @xmath4 structure , where typically @xmath6 , @xmath1 are elements with d - electrons and @xmath2 are elements with s , p electrons . in the cubic high - temperature austenite phase , ni@xmath9mnga has a @xmath5 structure that consists of four interpenetrating face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) sub - lattices with origin at fractional positions , ( 0.25,0.25,0.25 ) , ( 0.75,0.75,0.75 ) ( 0.5,0.5,0.5 ) , and ( 0.0,0.0,0.0 ) . in @xmath10 structure of ni@xmath9mnga ,",
    "the ni atoms occupy the first and second sub - lattices . on the contrary , mn and ga",
    "occupy the third and fourth sub - lattices , respectively . in this paper , we have carried out calculations on ni and co - based systems .",
    "so ni and co are taken as @xmath6 atom and @xmath2 = ga as well as sn .",
    "as for the @xmath1 atom , we have taken into consideration and consequently tested the electronic stability of the first five atoms of the first as well as second rows of the transition metal atoms .",
    "therefore , sc , ti , v , cr and mn as well as y , zr , nb , mo and tc are considered as the @xmath1 atom .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constants of all these alloys are obtained by full geometry optimization using vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite which has been used in combination with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) over the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation functional.@xcite gga is used because it accounts for the density gradients , and hence , for most of the heusler alloy systems , it has been found that it yields results which are in better agreement with experimental data compared to the results of lda .",
    "we have used an energy cutoff of 500ev for the planewaves .",
    "the final energies have been calculated with a @xmath11 mesh of 15@xmath1215@xmath1215 for the cubic case and a similar number for the tetragonal case .",
    "the energy and the force tolerance for our calculations were 10 @xmath13ev and 10 mev /  , respectively .",
    "the formation energies ( @xmath14 ) , as calculated@xcite by the equation below , has been critically analysed to establish the electronic stability of the alloys .",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes different types of atoms present in the unit cell of the material system and @xmath17 are the standard state energies of the corresponding atoms @xmath16.@xcite the optimized geometries of the systems studied are compared with the results obtained in the literature , wherever results are available , and these match well with earlier data as discussed in the section on results and discussion .",
    "the response of a material to an applied stress is associated with the elastic constants of the material . both stress ( @xmath18 ) and strain ( @xmath19 ) in a material",
    "have three tensile as well as three shear components .",
    "therefore , the linear elastic constants form a 6@xmath126 symmetric matrix .",
    "we have @xmath20 = @xmath21 @xmath22 for small stresses , @xmath18 , and strains , @xmath19 .",
    "calculations of the mechanical properties of the materials involve the variation of total energy of the system induced by the strain.@xcite elastic constants of all the materials are evaluated from the second derivative of the energy with respect to the strain tensor .",
    "the number of @xmath11-points and the energy cut - off have been increased from the values used in scf calculations till the convergence of the mechanical properties of each individual material has been achieved .",
    "mesh of @xmath11-points has been taken as 15@xmath1215@xmath1215 and energy cut - off of 500 ev as per the convergence requirement .",
    "it is well known that , all - electron calculations are more reliable for the prediction of magnetic properties particularly for the systems containing first row transition elements .",
    "hence , to calculate and understand in detail the magnetic as well as electronic properties , we have carried out relativistic spin - polarized all - electron calculations of all the systems , geometries being optimized by vasp.@xcite these calculations have been performed using full potential linearized augmented planewave ( fplapw ) program@xcite with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional.@xcite for obtaining the electronic properties , the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration has been carried out using the tetrahedron method with blchl corrections.@xcite an energy cut - off for the plane wave expansion of about 17 ry is used ( @xmath23@xmath24 = 9.5 ) .",
    "the cut - off for charge density is @xmath25= 14 . the number of @xmath11 points for the self - consistent field ( scf ) cycles in the reducible ( irreducible ) bz is about 8000 ( 256 ) for the cubic phase and about 8000 ( 635 ) for the tetragonal phase .",
    "the convergence criterion for the total energy @xmath26 is about 0.1 mry per atom .",
    "the charge convergence is set to 0.0001 .    to gain further insight into the magnetic interactions of some of the magnetic materials , we calculate and discuss their heisenberg exchange coupling parameters .",
    "the geometries optimized by vasp have been used for these calculations .",
    "we use the spin - polarized - relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker method ( spr - kkr ) to calculate the heisenberg exchange coupling parameters , j@xmath27 , within a real - space approach , which is proposed by liechtenstein et al@xcite and implemented in the spr - kkr programme package.@xcite the mesh of k points for the scf cycles has been taken as 21@xmath1221@xmath1221 in the bz .",
    "the angular momentum expansion for each atom is taken such that lmax=3 .",
    "in addition , in terms of the heisenberg exchange coupling parameters we derive the curie temperature ( t@xmath28 ) following the literature@xcite .",
    "* lattice parameter and atomic number @xmath29 of @xmath1 atom * - for the cubic phase , the @xmath5 structure has been assumed for all the structures studied here , namely , ni@xmath0 and co@xmath0 ( @xmath1 = sc , ti , v , cr and mn as well as y , zr , nb , mo and tc ; @xmath2 = ga and sn ) .",
    "the geometry has been optimized to obtain the converged lattice parameter .",
    "figure 1 and figure 2 show the variation of this lattice parameter as a function of @xmath29 of @xmath1 elements of @xmath4 alloy ( @xmath6 = ni , co ; @xmath2 = ga , sn ) .",
    "the @xmath1 atoms correspond to the period iv of the periodic table ( first row transition metal atoms ; sc etc ) and the period v ( second row transition metal atoms ; y etc ) .",
    "therefore , in figures 1 and 2 , we have mentioned the period numbers iv and v in the legends . for the ni@xmath0 materials ,",
    "it is observed , as the atomic number of @xmath1 elements increases , with a saturating trend towards higher @xmath29 , lattice parameters of the materials decrease for a fixed row of the periodic table ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this may happen due to the increasing electro - negativity and decreasing atomic radius of atoms across the column .",
    "further , for these materials we observe ( in the left panel of figure 1 ) a sudden increase in the lattice parameter value for @xmath29 of @xmath1 = 24 ( i.e. cr atom ) .",
    "it is to be noted that out of all the materials studied here , a deviation from the ferromagnetic nature is expected for ni@xmath3crsn as well as ni@xmath3crga which was reported earlier.@xcite these two materials have lower energy for a long - range _ intra - sublattice _ anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering compared to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) one .",
    "this difference in the long - range magnetic interaction between the fhas with @xmath1 = cr and the other @xmath1 atoms indicates that the cr - based materials are possibly of a different class compared to the rest of the fhas , considered here",
    ". this may be the reason behind the deviation from the observed trend .",
    "it is to be further noted that for the afm ordering the lattice parameter ( shown by a black square ) is even larger compared to the corresponding fm phase .",
    "however , the long - range magnetic interaction in all the materials with @xmath6 = co is ferromagnetic . for these co - based materials",
    "the lattice parameters show a smooth decrease as we increase the @xmath29 of the @xmath1 atom ( figure 2 ) . as discussed above for ni - based systems , this may , again , be due to the increase of electronegativity and decrease of atomic radius across the column which may have led to the shrinkage of the electron cloud around the @xmath1 atom , and consequently , of the whole unit cell .",
    "it has been observed that there is an increase in the lattice parameter values when we go from period iv to period v , for both ni and co - based materials .",
    "increase of atomic radius is observed across the row , going from period iv to v , and the above - mentioned trend may be because of that .",
    "* formation energy and atomic number @xmath29 of @xmath1 atom * - figure 3 as well as figure 4 suggest that the formation energy is negative for all of the materials with @xmath2 atom = ga , except ni@xmath3tcga which is having marginally positive formation energy .",
    "it is to be noted that co@xmath3tcga has marginally negative formation energy and hence in reality may not be stable electronically .",
    "it is well - known that negative formation energy signifies stability ; more negativity indicates more stability of the material .",
    "a few of the materials , @xmath4 , where @xmath2 = sn , like ni@xmath3mosn , ni@xmath3tcsn , co@xmath3crsn , co@xmath3mosn and co@xmath3tcsn , are having positive formation energy .",
    "these calculated values and the prediction that these particular materials are electronically unstable , matches with the results wherever available in the literature.@xcite the afm phases for ni@xmath3crga and ni@xmath3crsn have very close but slightly smaller @xmath14 compared to the respective fm case .",
    "it is observed from both the figures that , overall , there is a trend of electronic stability decreasing as @xmath29 of @xmath1 atom increases .",
    "however , for @xmath1 = mn , the stability has increased compared to the previous @xmath1 element .",
    "this suggests an interesting preferance for the mn atom in the @xmath1 position for the heusler alloys with @xmath5 structure in both the cases when @xmath6 atom is ni or co. similar is the case with @xmath1 = zr .",
    "it is seen that , for y , i.e. the first atom of the second row of the transition metal atoms ( period v ) at the @xmath1 position , the formation energy is somewhat unfavorable compared to the next case of @xmath1 = zr . the origin of this has been found to be electronic in nature - analysis of the density of states for @xmath1 = zr indicates a lowering of binding energy in this material compared to the @xmath1 = y case .",
    "it is observed that the contribution from the majority spin density of states of the co atom plays an important role . for our further studies ,",
    "we concentrate only on the materials which , from our calculations , are found to be electronically stable .",
    "* electronic stability of the tetragonal phase * - we calculate the difference between the energy of the cubic ( @xmath30 ) and tetragonal ( @xmath31 ) phases of all the electronically stable materials .",
    "figure 5 shows this energy difference , @xmath32 = @xmath31 - @xmath30 ( in units of mev per atom ) , of some typical materials as a function of the ratio of lattice constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 . from our calculations ,",
    "we find that only a few materials , among all the electronically stable and magnetic fhas we study here , exhibits the tetragonal phase as a lower energy state . among all the ni - based alloys",
    ", we find that ni@xmath3moga and ni@xmath3crsn possess a lower energy for the tetragonal phase over the cubic phase similar to ni@xmath3mnga and ni@xmath3crga , both of which have a tetragonal ground state , as has already been shown in the literature . from figure 5",
    ", we also observe that ni@xmath3vga and ni@xmath3vsn have very flat energy curves with no clear minimum in the @xmath32 versus @xmath33/@xmath34 curve .",
    "further , we observe that though in case of ni@xmath3mnsn , there is a cubic ground state , there is also a very subtle signature of a tetragonal phase which is evident from the clear asymmetric nature of the @xmath32 versus @xmath33/@xmath34 curve for this material ( figure 5 ) .",
    "it is observed that ni@xmath3moga exhibits a non - magnetic state as ground state .",
    "further , ni@xmath3crga and ni@xmath3crsn are likely to possess an _ intra - sublattice _ afm phase as a ground state .",
    "it is to be noted that , in this paper , our concentration will be only on the alloys which will have fm phase in its ground state .",
    "so , for ni - based alloys , further on , we will discuss only about ni@xmath3mnga and ni@xmath3mnsn .    out of all the co - based alloys studied here ,",
    "we observe that only two alloys are likely to show energetically lower martensite phase over the cubic austenite phase . out of these two",
    ", while co@xmath3nbsn is known in the literature@xcite , co@xmath3moga is not reported till date . from figure 5",
    ", it is clearly seen that for co@xmath3moga a significant energy difference exists between the cubic and tetragonal phases .",
    "this indicates that a martensite phase transition is possible in this material .",
    "it is expected that the martensite transition temperature for co@xmath3moga will be higher than ni@xmath3mnga since the energy difference @xmath32 between the austenite and martensite phase of the former is evidently much larger than that of the latter .",
    "this expectation is because it is argued in the literature , that , relative values of @xmath32 can be indicative of the relative values of martensite transition temperatures of two alloys.@xcite a cubic ground state is observed for many co - based alloys , including the two well - known co - based half - metallic - like materials co@xmath3mnsn@xcite and co@xmath3mnga@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are three more alloys which show a state of cubic symmetry having a lowest energy while the tetragonal phases of these materials are energetically very close ( within 25 mev ) to the respective austenite phases .",
    "the @xmath32 versus @xmath33/@xmath34 plots of these materials , namely , co@xmath3vga ,",
    "co@xmath3crga and co@xmath3tcga are included in figure 5 which clearly depict this energetic aspect .",

    "for demonstrating the differences , we concentrate on eight typical fm materials and present the detailed results of the same .",
    "three of these fm materials are likely to undergo a tetragonal distortion at low temperature and these materials are ni@xmath3mnga , co@xmath3moga , co@xmath3nbsn .",
    "the other group of alloys consists of materials having a cubic ground state . among these alloys ,",
    "the following compounds have been considered - co@xmath3vga , co@xmath3crga , co@xmath3mnga , co@xmath3mnsn and ni@xmath3mnsn , which are expected to have a cubic symmetry at the lowest temperature .",
    "tables 3 and 4 contain the bulk mechanical properties of these above - mentioned ni and co - based alloys , respectively .",
    "values of few other materials are also listed in tables 3 and 4 , for comparison .",
    "it is observed that the overall agreement with the values from the literature is reasonably good .",
    "there are three independent elastic constants for a cubic structure .",
    "these are c@xmath38 , c@xmath39 and c@xmath40 .",
    "these three elastic constants can be found by calculating energies for three different types of strain on the unit cell of the system under equilibrium . from these three linearly independent energy versus strain data",
    ", we can find out c@xmath38 , c@xmath39 and c@xmath40 .",

    "then strain is applied to the system . under this strained condition",
    ", the energy ( @xmath46 ) is calculated and subsequent to that , the elastic constants are obtained from our calculations as discussed below .",
    "the energies @xmath47 are plotted as a function of applied strain and fitted with a fourth order polynomial .",
    "the second order coefficient of the fit gives the elastic constants .",

    "it is clear from table 3 , that for ni@xmath3mnga , as expected , the tetragonal shear constant is quite close to zero .",
    "for ni@xmath3moga the value of c@xmath52 is found to be negative , which indicates that it has a mechanically unstable cubic austenite phase , which corroborates the result presented in figure 5 .",

    "the experimental @xmath54 value is close to the calculated @xmath55 value while @xmath56 value remains largely underestimated .",

    "the co @xmath63 @xmath67 peak is at just above fermi level ( at about + 0.05 ev ) . under tetragonal distortion",
    "this peak is split into two : one part being above the fermi level and another one being below the fermi level .",
    "this splitting lowers the energy of the system and the tetragonal phase tends to be the ground state structure compared to the cubic structure . in the literature@xcite",
    ", it has been observed that at the fermi energy , the contribution to dos mainly comes from the @xmath63 bands of co and nb .",

    "but under tetragonal distortion , this single peak is split into two and the energy of the tetragonal phase is lower compared to the cubic phase . it has been observed@xcite that the band jahn - teller distortion is the cause of the structural transition .",
    "as seen from figures 12 and 16 , for co@xmath3mnsn , the peak due to co @xmath63 @xmath67 levels is located at a higher energy ( at about + 0.8 ev ) compared to co@xmath3nbsn .",
    "after the application of the tetragonal distortion this single peak is split into two ( figure 16 ) .",

    "also lowering of energy under tetragonal deformation is not possible , which is consistent with the results presented in figure 5 .",
    "finally , we find that in all the materials , as a result of tetragonal distortion , the degeneracy is lifted for the @xmath63 sub - bands in the minority spin channel of @xmath6 atoms , present closest to the fermi level .",
    "subsequently , as a result of this band jahn - teller effect , a redistribution of the density of states of these @xmath63 electrons occurs . in all the materials , which favor a tetragonal deformation ,",
    "a substantial density of states very close to the fermi level has been observed . in other words ,",
    "the band jahn - teller effect is found to be , as expected , quite sensitive to the dos at or close to the @xmath64 in the cubic phase . as a result of the redistribution of the dos , under tetragonal distortion , due to closeness of peak in dos to the @xmath64 ,",
    "the energy gets lowered in these materials .",
    "consequently , the possibility of martensite transition is found to be high .",
    "further , for these materials , a negative or very close to zero value of tetragonal shear constant , c@xmath52 , has also been observed , as is expected from the literature .",
    "for all the other materials , under tetragonal distortion , the splitting of the @xmath63 minority spin levels is observed as well but the peak is away from the @xmath64 resulting in a reduced density of states at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the lowering of free energy is not possible , which renders the tetragonal transition unlikely .",
    "the observation regarding the cubic ground state for these materials is further corroborated by the relatively large and positive values of @xmath68 for all these materials .",
    "it has been of particular interest that out of all the ni and co - based full - heusler alloys studied so far in the literature , only some materials undergo the martensite transition and these generally show the technologically important magnetic shape memory alloy property .",
    "these full heusler alloys in general are found to be metallic in nature . on the other hand",
    ", it has been observed that there is another group of fhas which are half - metallic - like in nature , with a much reduced density of states at the fermi level in case of one of the spin channels and these materials generally do not exhibit msma property .",
    "it has been observed earlier that while most of the ni - based fhas show msma property , many of the co - based fhas exhibit large spin - polarization at the fermi level .",
    "therefore , in this paper , using first - principles calculations based on density functional theory , we study in detail the bulk mechanical , magnetic and electronic properties of a series of ni and co - based full heusler alloys , namely , ni@xmath0 and co@xmath0 ( @xmath1 = sc , ti , v , cr and mn as well as y , zr , nb , mo and tc ; @xmath2 = ga and sn ) . after establishing the electronic stability from the formation energy and subsequent full geometry optimization , we carry out the calculation of different properties to probe and understand , the similarities and differences in the properties of these materials .",
    "we analyze the data in detail to see if among these materials there is any fha which has a tendency to undergo a tetragonal transition and at the same time possesses a high spin polarization at the fermi level .    out of all the electronically stable compounds of the total forty ni and co - based materials ,",

    "the other hand , ni@xmath3mnga and ni@xmath3mnsn as well as all the co - based materials are ferromagnetic in nature .",
    "further , from the heisenberg exchange interaction parameters , it is seen that the materials exhibit similar nature in terms of the relative contributions of the direct and rkky - type nature of the magnetic interactions .",
    "the trend of the calculated values of curie temperature for various materials , obtained from the @xmath69 parameters , matches reasonably well with the literature wherever data are available . from the point of view of bulk mechanical properties , the values of tetragonal shear constant show consistent trend : high positive for materials not prone to tetragonal transition and low or negative for others .",
    "a general trend of nearly - linear inverse relationship between the cauchy pressure and the @xmath54/@xmath1 ratio is predicted for both the ni and co - based materials .",
    "it is observed that the ni - based materials are typically metallic in nature .",
    "however , all the co - based alloys exhibit a significant spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "most of the ni - based materials have a @xmath63 band of the minority spin of the @xmath6 atoms close to and below the @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "the peak position of the same band is above the @xmath64 for the co - based materials .",
    "we observe that , in both the cases of ni and co - based materials , these @xmath63 levels play an important role in deciding the ground state .",
    "further , the replacements of the @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 sites of the @xmath4 materials by different atoms , indicate that in general a rigid band model explains the differences in the electronic structure of both the ni and co - based materials to a large extent .",
    "this model along with the hybridization between atoms , further supports the results of partial and total moments of these systems .",
    "the relation between the closeness of the peak corresponding to the @xmath65 levels of the @xmath63 down spin electrons of the @xmath6 atom to the @xmath64 and the tendency of lowering of energy upon tetragonal distortion is consistent across all the ni and co - based materials .",
    "finally , from our study on the two categories of materials , it is clear that out of all the materials which we study here , only four fhas show a tendency of undergoing martensite transition . out of these four materials , which have a conventional heusler alloy structure and",
    "exhibit a clear possibility of finding a tetragonal phase as their ground state , three of them , namely , ni@xmath3mnga , ni@xmath3moga and co@xmath3nbsn have a metallic nature as is observed in case of majority of the msma material ; on the other hand , from our calculations , co@xmath3moga is expected to emerge as a _ shape memory alloy with high spin polarization at the fermi level_. this interesting finding awaits a suitable experimental validation .",

    "<S> using first - principles calculations based on density functional theory , we have studied the mechanical , electronic , and magnetic properties of heusler alloys , namely , ni@xmath0 and co@xmath0 ( @xmath1 = sc , ti , v , cr and mn as well as y , zr , nb , mo and tc ; @xmath2 = ga and sn ) . on the basis of electronic structure ( density of states ) and mechanical properties </S>",
    "<S> ( tetragonal shear constant ) , as well as magnetic interactions ( heisenberg exchange coupling parameters ) , we probe the properties of these materials in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the formation energy of these alloys in the ( face - centered ) cubic austenite structure to probe the stability of all these materials . from the energetic point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the possibility of the electronically stable alloys having a tetragonal phase lower in energy compared to the respective cubic phase . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of the magnetic alloys is found to have the cubic phase as their ground state . on the other hand , for another class of alloys , </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonal phase has been found to have lower energy compared to the cubic phase . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find that the values of tetragonal shear constant show a consistent trend : a high positive value for materials not prone to tetragonal transition and low or negative for others . in the literature , materials , which have been seen to undergo the martensite transition , </S>",
    "<S> are found to be metallic in nature . </S>",
    "<S> we probe here if there is any heusler alloy which has a tendency to undergo a tetragonal transition and at the same time possesses a high spin polarization at the fermi level . from our study </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that out of the four materials , which exhibit a martensite phase as their ground state , three of these , namely , ni@xmath3mnga , ni@xmath3moga and co@xmath3nbsn have a metallic nature ; on the contrary , co@xmath3moga exhibits a high spin polarization . </S>"
