    "althouth the behaviour of the quasi two - dimensional electron gas ( q2deg ) in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field has been studied extensively , much less attention has been devoted to the situation where the magnetic field is applied parallel to the q2deg . in the former case , interesting phenomena e.g. the shubnikov - de haas effect @xcite and the integer @xcite and the fractional @xcite quantum hall effects have been observed . in the latter case ,",
    "electrons move under the competing influence of the lorenz force and the force due to the quantum well confining potential .    in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field , @xmath3 , single heterojunctions @xcite , single @xcite , double @xcite and triple @xcite square quantum wells , almost square quantum wells @xcite , asymmetric",
    "square quantum wells @xcite , symmetrical wide single quantum wells@xcite and superlattices @xcite have been considered .",
    "the experimental studies include single heterojunctions @xcite , double square quantum wells @xcite , triple square quantum wells @xcite , wide single quantum wells @xcite and superlattices @xcite .",
    "the most important experimental finding @xcite is , according to our opinion , the strong conductance `` oscillations '' due to the variation of the density of states ( dos ) , as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "conductance maxima are identified with depopulations of local energy dispersion minima , while conductance minima are identified with van hove singularities at the chemical potential .",
    "this situation has been encountered in symmetrical square double @xcite and triple @xcite quantum wells and in symmetrical wide single quantum wells @xcite . while in the cases of square double and triple quantum wells a simple tight binding calculation gave the position of the maxima and the minima , a self - consistent calculation was indispensable in the case of symmetrical wide single quantum wells .",
    "theoretical studies of the electronic states are usually restricted to simple analytically solvable potential wells , to tight binding approximation , or to perturbative approximations .",
    "self - consistent studies are up to now a few , regarding single heterojunctions @xcite , thin single quantum wells @xcite and symmetrical wide single quantum wells @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we use self - consistent calculations to study al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as wide double heterojunctions ( i.e. a system of two heterojunctions with relatively large distance between the two interfaces ) subjected to an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "below , we summarize the particular aims of this work .",
    "our first aim is to study the density of states when the q2deg is subjected to an in - plane magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the dos is not a step - like function , as it is with @xmath3=0 .",
    "we show that its form undergoes important changes as @xmath3 is increased , especially in wide double heterojunctions where usually many subbands are present @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent study of the electronic states and specifically of the dos is of great importance for the explanation of the experimental magnetoconductivity in these structures .",
    "however , up to now , there is no systematic study of the dos under these circumstances .",
    "we attempt to give a contribution in this direction .",
    "our second aim is to study a bilayer electron system , different from the commonly used symmetrical double square well .",
    "another potentially bilayer electron system is the symmetrical double heterojunctions , when the well width is increased a lot , due to the transition from a `` perfect '' square quantum well to a system of two separated heterojunctions @xcite . in the former structure",
    "a high barrier separates the two electron layers . in the latter structrure",
    "the barrier is formed from the redistribution of the carriers in the well and it is relatively weak .",
    "moreover , smrcka and jungwirth @xcite have shown , by calculating the energy dispersion curves in a two - subband situation , that symmetrical wide single quantum wells can be potentially bilayer electron systems when the parallel magnetic field is increased . here , we present the depopulations of the higher subbands and the transition from a single layer to a bilayer electron system not only in the `` energy dispersion picture '' , but also in the `` electron concentration picture '' .",
    "thus , we calculate the electron concentration , @xmath4 and the distribution of the electrons in the subbands , @xmath5",
    ". we also give the `` the density of states '' picture , which is important for the interpretation of the transport experiments .",
    "moreover , we show in these three pictures that in the centre of our wide quantum well , as the magnetic field is further increased , the bulk landau levels dominate . finally , we give an example of an asymmetric heterostructure .",
    "the basic theory is presented in section 2 together with some analogies to the classical picture . in section 3",
    "we present the theoretical results for al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as double heterojunctions and we comment on some interesting features observed .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "when a magnetic field , @xmath3 , parallel to the y - axis , is applied to a three dimensional electron gas , the motion in the xz - plane is quantized to landau levels with energy eigenvalues @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a discrete quantum number , @xmath8 is the reduced planck constant and @xmath9 , is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "@xmath10 is the effective mass and q =- e is the electron charge .",
    "if we additionally apply an electric field , @xmath11 , in the z - axis , @xmath12 depend not only on @xmath7 , but also on the wavevector in the x - axis , @xmath13 . specifically , @xmath14 . in this work",
    "we are interested in the configuration with a quantum well in the z - axis ( with or without the electric field in the z - axis ) and the magnetic field in the y - axis . again , as we discuss below , @xmath12 depend on both @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , generally in this case @xmath15 can not be expressed analytically and have to be determined self - consistently . of course , without a magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath16 , where now @xmath7 is the subband index .",
    "in all the situations described above , the energy eigenvalue in the y - axis is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wavevector in the y - axis .",
    "the spin part of the eigenenergy is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the effective land factor and @xmath21 is the bohr magneton .    summarizing , in the present configuration , there is a magnetic field in the y - axis , a quantum well in the z - axis and possibly an electric field in the z - axis ( e.g. an external field due to a gate ) . with our choice of axes ,",
    "the hamiltonian is :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the momentum operator , @xmath24 is the vector potential , @xmath25 is the gaas effective mass , @xmath26 is the electron mass , @xmath27 is the spin and @xmath28 is the parallel magnetic field .",
    "@xmath29    where @xmath30 is the potential energy term due to the conduction band minima discontinuity , @xmath31 is the coulombic potential energy , @xmath32 is the exchange and correlation potential energy @xcite and @xmath33 is the potential energy due to an electric field applied in the z - axis e.g. due to a gate . the magnetic field is applied in the y - axis i.e. @xmath34 . for the vector potential",
    "we choose @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes :    @xmath36    we split the spatial and the spin part .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 . for the spatial part",
    "the envelope function equation writes :    @xmath39\\psi = e_{xyz}\\psi.\\ ] ]    @xmath40=[\\hat p_y,\\hat h]=0 $ ] .",
    "thus , we look for solutions in the form @xmath41 , where s = l@xmath0l@xmath42 is the area of the heterostructure in the xy - plane .",
    "the coordinate y splits from the coordinates x and z. we have @xmath43 , while in the xz plane :    @xmath44\\zeta(z)=0.\\ ] ]    the non - magnetic part of the potential energy is u(z ) , while the magnetic part of the potential energy is @xmath45 .",
    "the center of the magnetic potential energy is the point @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the electron is free in the y - axis , but the magnetic field correlates the motion in the x - axis and the z - axis .",
    "the motion in the xz - plane is characterised by a running wave @xmath47 and the bound state @xmath48 which depends on both i and @xmath13 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are :    @xmath49    where , generally @xmath50 .    the density of states is :    @xmath51    where :    @xmath52    we have used the symbolism @xmath53 .",
    "intergrating over @xmath18 , eq .",
    "8 writes :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the step function .",
    "we must note here that the dos is not a step - like function , as it is with zero magnetic field .",
    "the electron concentration is :    @xmath56    where :    @xmath57    @xmath58 is the fermi - dirac distribution function and @xmath59 is the three - dimensional envelope function .",
    "thus , at finite temperature , @xmath60 :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the chemical potential and k@xmath63 is the boltzmann constant . using eq .",
    "( 12 ) , eq .",
    "( 10 ) becomes :    @xmath64    therefore , the sheet electron concentration , is :    @xmath65    for a hamiltonian like that in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath66 @xcite , which in our case becomes @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "thus , after a little algebra we obtain for the accelaration and the force operators in the x , y and z axes , respectively : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "so , in the y - axis there is no force on the electrons , in the x - axis there is only the lorenz force , while in the z - axis there is apart from the lorenz force , the force due to the quantum well confining potential .    when there is no quantum well ( @xmath76 ) the quantities @xmath77 , which corresponds to the z - coordinate of the center of the classical cyclic orbit , and @xmath78 , which corresponds to the x - coordinate of the center of the classical cyclic orbit , are constants of the motion .",
    "when @xmath76 , the quantity @xmath79 , which corresponds to the square of the radius of the classical cyclic orbit is also a constant of the motion .",
    "thus , when @xmath80 can be ignored , electrons describe the well - known spiral motion .",
    "the algorithm used to solve self - consistently the equations above , is divided in the following steps . ( @xmath81 ' ) we input an initial guess for the non - magnetic potential energy , @xmath82 . ( @xmath83 ' ) we solve the envelope function eq .",
    "( 5 ) for each i and for each @xmath13 to obtain @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "care should be taken in this step , to include all possible i and all possible @xmath13 which contribute to the electron concentration .",
    "thus , we start with many subbands and with a wide range of k@xmath0 .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( 5 ) must be solved _ many _ times .",
    "( @xmath86 ' ) @xmath62 can be calculated from charge neutrality @xcite , using eq .",
    "( @xmath87 ' ) thus , we can calculate , from eq .",
    "( 13 ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 and therefore @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "( @xmath88 ' ) now the charge density is known and it is used to solve the poisson equation numerically @xcite , to obtain @xmath31 . we suppose that @xmath89 , because there is no net charge in the bulk material .",
    "we take into account the different dielectric constants of gaas and al@xmath0ga@xmath1as @xcite .",
    "finally , we choose @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the value of the conduction band minima discontinuity .",
    "@xmath92 , because the envelope functions decay into the al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barriers .",
    "thus , @xmath93 .",
    "all the structures are long enough in the z - axis , so that bulk conditions prevail before the end of the al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barriers . ( @xmath94 ' ) the output non - magnetic potential energy , @xmath95 , can now be calculated from eq . ( 2 ) . ( @xmath96 ' ) if @xmath95 is `` very close '' to @xmath82 , we have finished .",
    "otherwise , we mix @xmath95 and @xmath82 to construct the new @xmath82 and we return to step ( @xmath83 ' ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we notice that since the envelope functions depend on both i and @xmath13 , a quantitative calculation of the conductivity will involve tedious algebra , because the scattering matrix elements will depend on @xmath13 , too .",
    "this complication emerges also in the calculation of the screening .",
    "for this reason , although some attemps have already been made @xcite , a well established transport theory for a q2deg with an in - plane magnetic field has not been developed yet .",
    "we apply our treatment to the case of a symmetrical @xmath87-doped al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as double heterojunction , in the presence of a parallel magnetic field , from 0 t up to 20 t .",
    "we choose a symmetrical structure because in this case we can observe most clearly the variation of the electronic states induced by the magnetic field in the `` energy dispersion picture '' , in the `` electron concentration picture '' and in the `` density of states picture '' .",
    "the structure consists of a 280 undoped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer , a si @xmath87-doped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer ( 0.28 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 ) , an undoped 250 al@xmath97ga@xmath98as spacer , a 600 undoped gaas well , an undoped 250 al@xmath97ga@xmath98as spacer , a si @xmath87-doped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer ( 0.28 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 ) and a 280 undoped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer . all layers are assumed to have a slight unintentional acceptor doping of 5 @xmath99 @xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "we suppose that the sample has been illuminated and therefore all the donors are ionized .",
    "this is done because we want to study the effect of the magnetic field under the condition of constant sheet electron concentration .",
    "although our treatment is applicable to any temperature , we will apply it to @xmath60 = 4.2k .",
    "this is done because the experiments are usually performed at or below @xmath60 = 4.2k .",
    "these material and structural parameters result in a sheet electron concentration , n@xmath104= 0.54 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 .",
    "first we will describe the evolution of the changes induced by the magnetic field to the energy dispersion curves , @xmath105 .",
    "the situation is described in the lower parts of fig .",
    "1 . in this particular structure , for @xmath106 , due to the large well width , the ground state subband and the first and second excited subbands are populated , with sheet electron concentrations @xmath107= 0.238 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath108= 0.233 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath109=0.069",
    "@xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "initially , as the magnetic field is increased , depopulation of the higher subbands is predicted .",
    "the second excited subband is depopulated at @xmath110 5 t and the first excited subband at @xmath110 7 t .",
    "increasing the magnetic field up to 7 t , the shapes of the @xmath105 dispersion curves also change . while the upper subbands remain almost parabolic , the first excited subband , and most obviously the ground state subband undergo important changes , developing gradually local maxima at @xmath111 instead of local minima at @xmath3 = 0 t . as can be seen from the lower parts of fig . 1",
    "this also happens to the other excited subbands for larger values of the magnetic field . for @xmath112 7 t , only the ground state subband is populated . at this point",
    "the @xmath113 dispersion curve is continuously below the chemical potential in the range @xmath114 $ ] m@xmath115 .",
    "this means that the system is still a single layer one .    at higher magnetic fields ,",
    "a transition from a single to a bilayer electron system occurs .",
    "this transition has approximately been achieved at @xmath3 = 12 t as can be seen from the lower part of fig .",
    "1c , but the complete separation of the two layers is achieved at @xmath3 = 20 t ( see fig .",
    "2 where the electron concentrations are presented ) . during this procedure",
    ", the energy separation of the unoccupied states ( those with small @xmath116 ) becomes @xmath117 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the well width is very large and therefore in the central region of the well , as the magnetic confinement overcomes the well confinement , the bulk landau levels dominate .",
    "this has also been predicted for square , analytically solvable , quantum wells when the well width is large enough @xcite .    in the case of a square quantum well",
    ", the behaviour of the @xmath105 curves is determined by the competition of the _ well width _ and the _ magnetic length _",
    ", @xmath118 @xcite . when the well width is smaller than the magnetic length , spatial quantization dominates .",
    "the energy levels can be roughly classified into two types , namely , _ confined _ states and _ extended _ states . in this",
    "_ specific case _ the confined states in the quantum well increase parabolically as a function of @xmath13 @xcite , while the extended states have an oscillating form with an `` average '' separation of @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "however , as the well width or the magnetic field is increased , this behavior changes . finally ,",
    "when the well width is larger than the magnetic length , the electron orbits are governed by the lorentz force and electrons basically describe spiral motion . at this point",
    "the energy dispersion curves are flat with a separation of @xmath117 .    in reference",
    "@xcite , the author , studing thin single quantum wells and taking as the growth axis the z - axis and the magnetic field in the x - axis , bypasses the dependence of the electronic states on the in - plane wavevector in the y - axis ( perpendicular to b ) , using only @xmath119 .",
    "this is done in order to override the large numerical cost of the general case .",
    "it is evident from the lower parts of fig.1 that such an approximation can not be applied in our case because of the strong depedence of the electronic states on this wavevector .",
    "moreover , for high enough values of the magnetic field the states with this wavevector are not occupied .",
    "the `` density of states picture '' is given in the upper parts of fig .",
    "we observe that although for @xmath3 = 1 t ( fig .",
    "1a ) the dos is almost step - like , there is already a peak due to the fact that @xmath120 has already developed a local maximum at @xmath13=0 , instead of the local minimum at @xmath3=0 t .",
    "this corresponds to a van hove singularity , since @xmath121 0 as we approach the critical point from below and @xmath122 0 as we approach the critical point from above .",
    "the dos of the first excited subband is not a `` perfect step '' , because @xmath123 is not exactly parabolic .",
    "the dos for the second and the third excited subbands are `` perfect steps '' because @xmath124 and @xmath125 are parabolic .",
    "we can also see that we have three populated subbands .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "1b we present the dos for @xmath3 = 7 t .",
    "clearly , we can observe the depopulation of the first excited subband .",
    "therefore , at this point , as we increase the magnetic field , the conductivity of the structure increases abruptly , due to the abrupt decrease of the dos at the chemical potential . we also observe that the total dos is not step - like and that the second and the third excited subbands are not exactly parabolic .",
    "moreover , since @xmath120 and @xmath123 have developed local maxima at @xmath13=0 , there are two peaks in the dos , corresponding to the two van hove singularities .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "1c we present the dos for @xmath3 = 12 t .",
    "there is a van hove singularity at the chemical potential , due to the local maximum of @xmath120 at @xmath13=0 .",
    "therefore , at this point , as we increase the magnetic field , the conductivity of the structure decreases abruptly due to the abrupt increase of the dos at the chemical potential .",
    "the total dos indicates that at the center of the well the bulk landau levels start to develop .",
    "all @xmath126 have already developed local maxima at @xmath13=0 and the energy separation of successive subbands for small @xmath116 is close to @xmath117 .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "1d we present the dos for @xmath3 = 20 t .",
    "the form of the total dos stems from the combination of two factors , i.e. as we move in the energy axis to higher energies : ( a ) from the two local minima of @xmath126 up to the local maximum of @xmath126 the bilayer electron system dominates .",
    "( b ) from the local maximum of @xmath126 up to the local minima of @xmath127 the bulk landau levels dominate . in this region",
    "the dos has the form @xmath128 = @xmath129 , which is the dos of a free particle in the y - axis together with an harmonic oscilator in the xz - plane .",
    "the energy separation of successive subbands for small @xmath116 is equal to @xmath117 .",
    "2 presents the variation of the electron concentration , @xmath4 and of the population of the subbands , @xmath5 , as we increase the magnetic field from 0 t to 20 t .",
    "the depopulation of the second excited subband at @xmath110 5 t and of the first excited subband at @xmath110 7 t can also be seen in this `` electron concentration picture '' .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "2 reveals that apart from these depopulations , the form of @xmath4 changes even from 1 t to 7 t , with a little bigger separation of the two parts of @xmath4 .",
    "this separation increases with the increase of the magnetic field . at 12 t",
    "there are still electrons in the middle of the well .",
    "the division into two parts is complete at 20 t .",
    "this means that the `` electron concentration picture '' gives a more precise depiction of the transision to a bilayer system than the `` energy dispersion picture '' .",
    "we finally give an example of an asymmetric heterostructure .",
    "the structure consists of a 700 undoped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer , a 50 si - doped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer ( 2 @xmath99 @xmath130 @xmath103 ) , an undoped 50 al@xmath97ga@xmath98as spacer , a 600 undoped gaas well , an undoped 200 al@xmath97ga@xmath98as spacer , a 50 si - doped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer ( 1 @xmath99 @xmath130 @xmath103 ) and a 600 undoped al@xmath97ga@xmath98as layer .",
    "we suppose , again , that all the layers have a slight unintentional acceptor doping of 4 @xmath99 @xmath102 @xmath103 and that the sample has been illuminated so that all the donors are ionized .",
    "@xmath60 = 4.2k .",
    "these material and structural parameters result in a sheet electron concentration , n@xmath104= 1.491 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 . for @xmath3 = 0 t , there are four populated subbands with sheet electron concentrations @xmath107= 0.742 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath108= 0.406 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath109=0.229 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath131=0.114 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , respectively .    in fig .",

    "we can observe the `` transposition and the anticrossings of the parabolas '' which result in a complicated form for the dos .",
    "we can also see that there are two different van hove singularities which give the peaks in the dos .    generally , both in the symmetrical and in the asymmetrical case",
    ", the van hove singularities are not simply saddle points because the @xmath126 , as we approach the critical points , are not of the form @xmath132 , @xmath1330 .",
    "the exact form of the dispersion curves is obtained from the self - consistent calculation . anyway , as we increase the magnetic field , whenever the chemical potential is identified with a van hove singularity , the conductivity of the structure will decrease abruptly . on the contrary , whenever there is a depopulation of a local energy dispersion minimum , due to the decrease of the dos at the chemical potential , the conductivity will increase abruptly .",
    "similar results are obtained for other values of the well width .",
    "it is the competition between the magnitude of the magnetic field and the spatial quantization - together with the influence of the number of electrons - that determines the overall behaviour of the system .",
    "extensive comparison with experiment will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have calculated self - consistently the energy dispersion curves , the density of states , the electron concentration and the distribution of the electrons in the subbands , for al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas/ al@xmath0ga@xmath1as double heterojunctions subjected to an in - plane magnetic field .    we have systematically studied the important changes in the density of states , induced by the variation of the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "we have pointed out that these changes are of crucial importance for the explanation of the magnetoconductivity experiments .    in the case of symmetric heterostructures , we have demonstrated in the `` energy dispersion picture '' , in the `` electron concentration picture '' and in the `` density of states picture '' the depopulation of the higher subbands , the transition from a single to a bilayer electron system and the domination of the bulk landau levels in the centre the wide quantum well , as the magnetic field is continuously increased .",
    "we have also given an example of an asymmetric heterostructure .",
