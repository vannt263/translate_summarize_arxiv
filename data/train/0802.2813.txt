    "pentacene ( pen ) is a conjugated molecule very well - known in the field of plastic electronics for its use in high - mobility organic thin - films transistors  @xcite .",
    "plastic electronics applications rely on the fact that at low density of charge carriers pentacene films effectively behave as weakly doped semiconductors  @xcite . in this regime , which is studied extensively , the interactions between charge carriers can be neglected .",
    "however , the opposite regime of high carrier density has remained virtually unexplored .",
    "since pentacene froms a molecular solid with narrow bandwidth it can be expected that at high density the simple assumptions of independent electron - band theories break down and the electronic correlations determine the electronic properties of the material  @xcite , as it happens in other molecular systems .",
    "the origin of correlated behavior in these systems is the competition between the energy gained by delocalizing the @xmath0 electrons ( given by the electronic bandwidth ) and the coulomb repulsion between two carriers on the same molecule .",
    "if the repulsion energy is larger than the one gained on delocalization , then the electrons become localized and a mott metal  insulator transition takes place . among the most studied molecular systems in the high carrier density regime are the intercalated c@xmath1 crystals  @xcite and the organic charge transfer salts , where the electronic interactions lead to the appearance of highly correlated magnetic ground states and unconventional superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to investigate pentacene compounds at high carrier density of the order of one carrier per molecule and to show that electron correlation effects are crucial to understand the resulting electronic properties . to this end , we have studied electronic transport through high - quality pentacene thin - films similar to those used for the fabrication of field - effect transistors . in order to reach high densities of charge carriers we intercalate the pentacene films with potassium atoms , to form k@xmath2pen .",
    "several past experimental studies have addressed the possibility to chemically dope pentacene thin films through the inclusion of alkali atoms and iodine .",
    "for all these compounds the structural investigations have shown that large concentrations of atoms ( up to three iodine atoms per pentacene molecule ) can intercalate in between the planes of the pentacene molecular films . similarly to the case of intercalated @xmath3  @xcite , the alkali atoms donate their electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the pentacene molecules , whereas the iodine donate holes to the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) ) , enabling the control of the conductivity of the films .",
    "earlier studies  @xcite indicate that upon iodine or rubidium intercalation the conductivity of pentacene films can become large ( in the order of 100 @xmath4 ) and exhibit a metallic temperature dependence .",
    "the experiments so far , however , have not led to an understanding of the doping dependence of the conductivity ( e.g. how many electrons can be transferred upon intercalation ) or about the microscopic nature of electrical conduction of doped pentacene in the high carrier density regime .",
    "in this paper we present the first experimental investigation of the evolution of the temperature - dependent conductivity of potassium - intercalated pentacene thin films , with increasing their doping concentration .",
    "we find that , upon k intercalation , pen films become metallic in a broad range of doping concentrations , up to k@xmath5pen , after which the conductivity re - enters an insulating state .",
    "our experiments also show that the structural disorder of pen films plays an important role on the transport properties of k@xmath2pen , as films of poor structural quality do not exhibit metallic behavior .",
    "the analysis of our data shows that at high carrier density the conductivity of k@xmath5pen can not be described in terms of independent electrons filling the molecular band originating from the lumo .",
    "rather , our observations are consistent with the formation of a mott insulating state , driven by electron - electron interactions , as we show theoretically by calculating the electronic structure of k@xmath5pen .",
    "our choice of working with pentacene thin - films ( as opposed to single crystals ) is motivated by both the relevance for applications control of doping in organic semiconductors is important for future plastic electronic devices and by the difficulty to grow crystals of alkali - intercalated pentacene , which has so far impeded this sort of investigations .",
    "all technical steps of our experimental investigations including the deposition of pentacene films , potassium intercalation , and temperature - dependent transport measurements have been carried out in ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) ( @xmath6 mbar ) in a fashion that is similar to our previous studies of intercalated phthalocyanine films  @xcite .",
    "the use of uhv prevents the occurrence of degradation of the doped films over a period of days .    as with the phthalocyanines , the pen films ( @xmath7 25 nm thick )",
    "were thermally evaporated from a knudsen cell onto a silicon substrate kept at room temperature . in order to minimize the parallel conduction through the silicon , we use a high resistive silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) wafer as substrate .",
    "the soi wafer consists of 2@xmath8 m silicon top - layer electrically insulated by 1@xmath8m - thick sio@xmath9 layer from the silicon substrate  @xcite .",
    "ti / au electrodes ( 10 nm ti and 50 nm au ) were deposited _",
    "ex situ _ on the soi substrates , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b . after the deposition of the electrodes and prior to loading the substrate into the uhv system ,",
    "a hydrogen - terminated si surface was prepared by dipping the soi surface in a hydrofluoric acid solution and rinsing in de - ionized water .",
    "the use of such a h - terminated silicon surface proved necessary to achieve sufficient quality in film morphology , as we will discuss in the next section in more detail .",
    "special care was taken to chemically purify pentacene prior to the film deposition .",
    "as - purchased pentacene powder was purified by means of physical vapor deposition in a temperature gradient in the presence of a stream of argon gas as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . after this step ,",
    "the pentacene powder was loaded in the knudsen cell in the uhv system and was further purified by heating it at a temperature just below the sublimation temperature for several days .",
    "the film thickness was determined by calibrating the pentacene deposition rate _",
    "ex - situ _ , using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "potassium doping was achieved by exposing the films to a constant flux of k atoms generated by a current - heated getter source .",
    "the source was calibrated and the potassium concentration determined by means of an elemental analysis performed on pen films doped at several doping levels , using _ ex - situ _ rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) . as shown in the top inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the ratio of k atoms to pen molecules , n@xmath10/n@xmath11 , increases linearly with increasing the doping time , as expected .",
    "deviations from linearity approximately 10 - 20% are due to inhomogeneity of the potassium concentration .",
    "the conductance of k@xmath2pen films is measured _ in situ _ in a two terminal measurement configuration with a contact separation of approximately 175 @xmath8 m ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "the dependence of the conductivity on the potassium concentration , hereafter referred to as the `` doping curve '' , is determined for different pen films , as a function of the ratio of k atoms to pen molecules .",
    "the doping curves for different samples are very similar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a . upon doping",
    ", the conductivity initially increases rapidly up to a value of @xmath12 in the same range as the conductivity of metallic k@xmath13c@xmath1  @xcite . upon doping further , the conductivity continues to increase more slowly , reaches a maximum at a concentration of one k per pen and then drops sharply back to the value of the undoped pen film .",
    "all of the more than 40 films that we have investigated exhibit a similar behavior .     and square conductance @xmath14 , of three different k - doped pen films , as function of the ratio n@xmath15/n@xmath11 ; under the curves a pentacene molecule .",

    "schematic view ( b ) of our set up and ( c ) atomic force microscopy image of a high quality undoped pen film showing large crystalline grains . ]",
    "the observed suppression of the conductivity of pentacene films at high doping ( for potassium concentrations higher than 1 k / pen ) allows us to exclude the possibility that the conduction of the intercalated films observed in the experiments is due to an experimental artifact , for instance the formation of a potassium layer on top of the pentacene film .",
    "in fact , at doping higher than 1 k / pen the measured conductance , and its temperature dependence , is essentially identical to what is measured for pristine films .    to understand the nature of conduction of pentacene films at high carrier density we measured the temperature dependence of the conductivity for different values of potassium concentration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tdep]a ) .",
    "pristine pen films have a very low conductivity and the measured conductance of undoped films is dominated by transport through the substrate s 2 @xmath8 m thick si top - layer .",
    "the measured conductivity decreases rapidly with lowering temperature , as expected , confirming that undoped ( @xmath16=0 ) pentacene films are insulating . on the contrary , in the highly conductive state for @xmath16 between 0.1 and 1 the conductance of the films remains high down to the lowest temperature reached in the experiments ( @xmath7 5 k ) , indicating a metallic state .",
    "when the potassium concentration is increased beyond approximately 1 k / pen , the conductivity again decreases rapidly with lowering temperature , indicating a re - entrance into an insulating state .",
    "the metallic and insulating nature of pentacene thin - films at different potassium concentrations is confirmed by measurements of volt - amperometric characteristics ( @xmath17-@xmath18 curves ) at 5 k. for @xmath16 between 0.1 and 1 the films exhibit linear @xmath17-@xmath18 characteristics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep]b , as expected for a metal . in the highly doped regime ( for @xmath19 ) , on the contrary , the insulating state manifests itself in strongly non - linear @xmath17-@xmath18 curves and virtually no current flowing at low bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep]c ) .",
    "therefore , the data clearly show that pentacene films undergo a metal - insulator transition as the density of potassium is increased past one atom per molecule . since in the overdoped regime",
    "the conduction occurs through the si layer of the soi substrate , it is not possible to gain specific information about the properties of the insulating kpen films for instance , to determine the electronic gap from measurements of the activation energy of the conductivity by studying _",
    "dc _ transport on our samples .",
    "-@xmath18 characteristics of k@xmath2pen in the ( b ) conducting and ( c ) highly - doped insulating state . ]",
    "the high structural quality of the films proves to be the essential ingredient necessary to obtain k@xmath2pen films which exhibited metallic conductivity .",
    "we find that the quality of pentacene thin films is highly sensitive to the choice of the substrate material and sufficient quality can be achieved by using a hydrogen - terminated si surface .",
    "to illustrate this important technical point , we show here that the structural quality of films deposited on a sio@xmath9 surface has a very large impact on their electronic transport , with low quality resulting in considerably poorer electrical properties .",
    "[ fig : fig1sm]a shows the doping curve of pen films deposited onto 300 nm sio@xmath9 that was thermally grown on a si substrate . for these films ,",
    "the maximum conductivity that we measured experimentally is several orders of magnitude lower than the conductivity measured for films deposited on a si surface .",
    "in addition , ( on sio@xmath9 ) the conductivity was always observed to decrease rapidly with lowering temperature , i.e. the potassium intercalated films are always insulating ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1sm]b ) . both the magnitude and the temperature dependence of the conductivity that we measured on sio@xmath9 substrates",

    "( c and d ) afm images of pentacene films grown on sio@xmath9 and on h - terminated si .",
    "small and randomly oriented grains with large height fluctuations are observed when the pen films are deposited on sio@xmath9 ( c ) , whereas pen films of similar thickness deposited on si consist of large crystalline grains with a common relative orientation and only relatively small fluctuations in height ( d ) . ]",
    "we attribute the difference in the electrical behavior observed for films deposited on si and sio@xmath9 substrates to the difference in film morphology , which we have analyzed using an atomic force microscope .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2sm ] shows afm images of two pentacene films of similar thickness deposited on the hydrogen terminated si ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2sm]a and b ) and on the sio@xmath9 surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2sm]c and d ) .",
    "it is apparent that very different morphologies are observed for the two substrates .",
    "pen films deposited on si surfaces exhibit large crystalline grains with a common relative orientation and only relatively small fluctuations in height . on sio@xmath9 , on the contrary , the grains are much smaller , randomly oriented and they exhibit much larger height fluctuations .     film grown on si .",

    "( b ) temperature dependence of the resistivity of a @xmath20 film grown on sio@xmath9 showing insulating behavior . ]",
    "this conclusion is consistent with past studies  @xcite showing that the growth and morphology of pentacene films is strongly influenced by the substrate surface .",
    "specifically , for pentacene films grown on sio@xmath9 , a high density of nucleation centers was observed , leading to the growth of small islands and to a high concentration of grain boundaries .",
    "on the hydrogen terminated silicon surface , on the other hand , the much smaller density of nucleation centers results in significantly larger islands and in a reduced density of grain boundaries . note that the critical influence of the film morphology on the electrical characteristics of electron - doped pentacene films is also supported by recent experiments studying the conduction of rubidium - intercalated pentacene films deposited on glass  @xcite . in that work , as - doped films exhibited an insulating temperature dependence of the conductivity .",
    "however , by performing a high - temperature annealing on the doped films , which results in an improved morphological quality , metallic behavior was also observed .",
    "the sensitivity of the morphology of pentacene films to the substrate , together with the resulting effects on the electronic properties , is common to films of many conjugated molecules .",
    "in fact , a similar sensitivity was found in our earlier work on the electronic properties of alkali doped metal - phthalocyanine ( mpc ) films  @xcite .",
    "specifically , for films of cupc , nipc , znpc , fepc , and mnpc , the maximum conductivity which can be achieved upon alkali doping when the films are deposited on sio@xmath9 substrates is several orders of magnitude lower than the conductivity measured for films deposited on a si surface , and has always an insulating temperature dependence .",
    "also for alkali doped c@xmath1 films , it has been observed that the surface termination of the substrate affects the morphology and the electronic transport properties of the films . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2sm]a , the resistivity of k@xmath21c@xmath1 films grown on si shows a low resistivity at low temperature and a transition to a superconducting state . on the contrary , the k@xmath21c@xmath1 films grown on sio@xmath9 have significantly higher resistivity , exhibiting thermally activated transport ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2sm]b ) , without a superconducting transition .",
    "the most striking aspect of our observations , namely a sharp decrease in the conductivity starting at a carrier concentration of one electron per molecule concomitant with the re - entrance into an insulating state , has not been reported in earlier experiments on intercalated pentacene ( in which the density of intercalants could not be determined  @xcite ) , nor in studies of pentacene field - effect transistors with gate electrolytes ( in which a metallic state has not been observed  @xcite ) .",
    "it implies that , contrary to the case of pentacene devices used in plastic electronics , the electronic properties of pentacene films at high carrier density can not be described in terms of non - interacting electrons .",
    "in fact , even though it is known that pentacene molecules can accept only one electron and that doubly negatively charged pentacene ions do not exist  @xcite ( i.e. , in our films charge transfer from the potassium atoms saturates at 1 k / pen ) , a carrier concentration of one electron per molecule corresponds to a half - filled band , and , for non - interacting electrons , should result in a metallic state .",
    "therefore , interactions need to be invoked in order to explain our observations .",
    "an established scenario for the formation of an insulating state at half - filling is the one of a mott insulator emerging from strong electron - electron interactions  @xcite . in a mott insulator",
    "a strong coulomb repulsion prevents two electrons to occupy the same pentacene molecule .",
    "since at half - filling the motion of electrons necessarily requires double occupation of molecular sites , electron transport is suppressed and the system becomes insulating .",
    "this scenario is usually modelled theoretically using a mott - hubbard hamiltonian , which includes a kinetic energy term described within a tight - binding scheme , and an on - site repulsion term .",
    "the mott state occurs when this repulsion ( @xmath22 ) is larger than the bandwidth @xmath23 ( determined by the tight - binding hopping amplitudes @xmath24 ) . in this case",
    "the half - filled band splits into a lower ( completely filled ) and an upper ( completely empty ) hubbard band , separated by a ( mott ) gap of the order of @xmath22 , when the interactions are strong .",
    "it is realistic that this scenario is realized in a molecular solid such as pentacene , in which the bandwidth is expected to be small owing to the absence of covalent bonds between the molecules .    to substantiate the mott - insulator hypothesis",
    "we have analyzed the electronic structure using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to extract the parameters of the mott - hubbard model .",
    "a main difficulty in doing this is that the structural knowledge of the intercalated films is incomplete , as our ultra - high vacuum set - up is not equipped to perform _ in situ _ structural characterization , and _ ex situ _ characterization is impeded by oxidation of potassium when the sample is extracted from the vacuum system where the films are prepared .",
    "therefore , for the dft calculations we take advantage of the existing structural information on intercalated pentacene compounds and we determine the stable crystal structure of k@xmath5pen using a computational relaxation procedure which refines the positions of all the atoms in the unit cell .",
    "it is well known from previous structural studies on pentacene films that the herringbone arrangement of the molecules is preserved when pentacene is intercalated with iodine  @xcite or with different alkali atoms  @xcite , and that intercalation takes place between the pentacene layers .",
    "it is also known that intercalation is accompanied by a considerable expansion of the unit cell @xmath25-axis ( by an amount close to the radii of the intercalated ions ) while the in - plane lattice parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are only minorly affected  @xcite .    a reliable estimate of the length of the expanded @xmath25-axis is given by the sum of the radius of the alkali ion and the pristine @xmath25-axis parameter : the @xmath25-axis lattice constants that are obtained in this way for , e.g. , rbpen and cspen are within 2% of the experimental values . for k@xmath5pen",
    "we construct the lattice parameters starting from two different polymorphs ( one with @xmath28 and the other with @xmath29  ) , using a k@xmath30 ionic radius of 1.33  .",
    "the structures of the two polymorphs are taken from the experimental results of ref .",
    "they differ slightly in the packing of the pentacene molecules , which enables us to study the influence of realistic variations of the packing on the electronic structure .",
    "the actual size of the c - axis in the k@xmath5pen is not critical .",
    "our relaxation and band - structure computations were checked for values up to @xmath31 larger and smaller than the estimated @xmath25-axis parameters .",
    "we found that even such relatively large variations of @xmath25 do not affect our main results ( i.e. , the values of the calculated bandwidth @xmath23 and on site repulsion @xmath22 ) , because the interaction between adjacent pentacene layers is weak .",
    "after constructing the unit cell of potassium - intercalated pentacene , using the information above to fix @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 , we refine the positions of the atoms by a computational relaxation procedure . for all the electronic structure calculations we used the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite with",
    "projector augmented waves ( paw )  @xcite and the pw91 density functional  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent calculations were carried out with an integration of the brillouin using the monckhorst - pack scheme with a 6x6x4 @xmath32-points grid and a smearing parameter of 0.01 ev , and a plane - waves basis set with a cutoff energy of 550 ev . to determine the stable structure of k@xmath5pen all the atoms positions in the unit cell",
    "are relaxed using a conjugate - gradient method . to avoid possible energy barriers we used a number of different initial configurations . in the relaxation procedure first the forces on the k - ions are calculated and then the k positions are relaxed .",
    "we observe that the dopants move into high symmetry positions in the plane between the pentacene layers . in the next step the positions of @xmath33 atoms in the unit cell",
    "are relaxed including the ones of the two pen molecules .",
    "the final stable structure is the same for all different initial configurations .    the optimized structure of k@xmath5pen is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] .",

    "an alternative procedure to take the electronic correlations into account , used in band structure calculations of strongly correlated transition metal oxides , is to incorporate the _ atomic _ hubbard @xmath22 directly in a lda+u scheme . for molecular crystals , however , this approach would require a novel computational scheme that uses a basis set of orthonormal molecular orbitals so that a _ molecular",

    "[ fig : fig4]c .",
    "the gap explains the observed re - entrance to the insulating state .",
    "note that the mott - state scenario also explains why the insulating state is only observed for a potassium concentration of 1.1 - 1.2 atoms per molecule ( and not at exactly one ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "in fact , at exactly one potassium per pentacene molecule , non - uniformity in the _ potassium _ concentration estimated to be approximately 10 - 20% in our films effectively dopes the mott insulator causing the conductivity to remain large .",
    "however , even in the presence of non - uniformity , a potassium concentration slightly larger than 1 k / pen results in a uniform _ electron _ concentration exactly equal to one electron per molecule , since , as we mentioned earlier , only one electron ( and not two ) can be donated to each pentacene molecule  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that imperfections in the material , either due to disorder of the dopants or in the molecular arrangements will lead to the presence of both disorder in the bandwidth and the presence of a disorder potential . in general the physics of disordered mott - hubbard systems",
    "is very rich  @xcite , but it is not a priori clear how relevant disorder will be in the present situation as we find that the mott state in k@xmath5pen is stabilized by a substantial electronic gap .",
    "since the coupling between pentacene molecules in different layers is very small and the electron - electron interaction is sufficiently large , the low - energy effective electronic hamiltonian of the k@xmath2pen reduces to the well - known two - dimensional @xmath59-model  @xcite with @xmath60 .",
    "interestingly , the same @xmath59-model in the same coupling regime describes another important class of materials , namely strongly correlated cuprate superconductors such as la@xmath61sr@xmath2cuo@xmath62 .",
    "an apparent difference between these classes of materials is that it is generally excepted that in doped organics the formation of lattice - polarons plays a very important role .",
    "we conclude that temperature - dependent transport measurements and theoretical calculations consistently indicate that at a doping concentration of one potassium ion per molecule potassium - intercalated pentacene is a strongly correlated mott insulator , whose electronic properties are dominated by electron - electron interactions .",
    "an immediate consequence is the emergence of magnetism .",
    "our calculations show that the magnetic interactions are dominated by a large , positive magnetic exchange @xmath63 290 k between electrons on nearest neighbor molecules in the same pentacene layer .",

    "<S> we investigate electronic transport through pentacene thin - films intercalated with potassium . from temperature - dependent conductivity measurements we find that potassium - intercalated pentacene shows metallic behavior in a broad range of potassium concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the conductivity exhibits a re - entrance into an insulating state when the potassium concentration is increased past one atom per molecule . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze our observations theoretically by means of electronic structure calculations , and we conclude that the phenomenon originates from a mott metal - insulator transition , driven by electron - electron interactions . </S>"
