    "the entanglement entropy of a quantum system has emerged as a useful probe in a number of fields . for example , the condensed matter community have recognized its utility as a diagnostic of phase transitions , especially in contexts where an analogue of a landau ",
    "ginsburg order parameter is either not accessible or available .",
    "the quantum information community employ it as a tool for assessing such things as the computational complexity of a system ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the quantum gravity community have used it to address important issues such as the entropy associated with a region of spacetime such as a black hole , where ( for example ) the important relation between the entropy of an excised region of spacetime ( such as the interior of a black hole ) and the area of the spacetime surrounding it can be motivated in terms of entanglement entropy ( see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite . ) in such studies , it is very important to be able to extract information about how the entanglement entropy scales with the size of a given system , or evolves as a function of time .    given a system , consider a region or subsystem which we can call @xmath1 , with the remaining part of the system denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "a definition of the entanglement entropy of @xmath1 with @xmath2 is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath1 given by tracing over the degrees of freedom of @xmath2 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the density matrix of the system .",
    "when the system is in a pure state , _",
    "@xmath7 , the entanglement entropy is a measure of the entanglement between the degrees of freedom in @xmath1 with those in @xmath2 .",
    "if the system starts in a pure state @xmath8 and the evolution of the system is unitary , then the system at subsequent times is also a pure state @xmath9 , and so the evolution of the entanglement entropy describes the evolution of quantum entanglement in the system .    the evolution of entanglement entropy in a ( 1 + 1)dimensional field theory after a quench was studied in ref .",
    "the system for @xmath10 is in the ground state ( with a mass gap ) , and at @xmath11 , the magnetic field is set to the critical point of the theory . dividing the system into @xmath1 ( a line segment of length @xmath12 ) and @xmath2 ( the rest ) , the analytical results for the system showed that the entanglement entropy grows linearly with time until it saturates at approximately @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite explained this as follows : at @xmath14 , the quench results in excitations that propagate to the left and to the right . since the system before the quench had a mass gap , only excitations produced at around the same local region will be entangled",
    "contributions to the entanglement entropy occur when a left / right mover remains in region @xmath1 whereas the right / left mover is in region @xmath2 .",
    "so since at time @xmath15 , the left ",
    "right pair are separated by a distance @xmath16 , saturation is reached when excitations produced at the center of @xmath1 reach @xmath2 which should be at @xmath17 .",
    "it is of interest to study more such systems and also to go beyond two dimensions .",
    "it is hard to make progress for many interacting field theories of interest , and so a search for powerful techniques from as broad a range of sources seems prudent .",
    "one such source of tools is the ads / cft correspondence@xcite .",
    "a prescription for calculating the entanglement entropy @xcite and its evolution @xcite in the context of ads / cft provides a new way to calculate the entanglement entropy using geometrical techniques that are classical in spirit ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) . in an asymptotically anti  de sitter ( ads ) geometry , consider a slice at constant ads radial coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "recall that this defines the dual field theory ( with one dimension fewer ) as essentially residing on that slice in , in the presence of a uv cutoff set by the position of the slice . sending the slice to the ads boundary at infinity",
    "removes the cutoff ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . on our @xmath19 slice ,",
    "consider a region @xmath1 .",
    "now find the minimal  area surface @xmath20 bounded by the perimeter of @xmath1 and that extends into the bulk of the geometry .",
    "then the entanglement entropy of region @xmath1 with @xmath2 is given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is newton s constant in the dual gravity theory .",
    "this prescription for the entropy coincides nicely with ( 1 + 1)dimensional computations of the entanglement entropy , and has a natural generalization to higher dimensional theories .",
    "note that there is no formal derivation of the prescription .",
    "steps have been made , such as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but they are not complete . however , there is lots of evidence for the proposal .",
    "e.g. , _ refs.@xcite .",
    "a review of several of the issues can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "further progress has been made recently in ref .",
    "although there is no derivation available , in this paper we shall assume that this holographic prescription does give the correct result for the entanglement entropy in higher dimensions .",
    "our results are interpreted in line with this . in particular , we find features that conform to expectations , and in addition we find new phenomena that we regard as predictions for the behavior of the field theory entanglement entropy .",
    "interesting recent papers , ref.@xcite , presented a study of the time evolution of a ( 1 + 1)dimensional system after a thermal quench , by working in the ads@xmath23 geometry dual to it . since , _ via _ the ads / cft correspondence , a thermal state in the field theory is dual to a black hole on the gravity side@xcite",
    ", the authors started with ads@xmath23 , perturbed it with a shell of matter , and then followed the subsequent formation of a black hole that took place , computing the entanglement entropy as a function of time using the above geometric prescription .",
    "they used the exact ads@xmath23 vaidya metric to describe the formation process .",
    "their results confirmed a number of key features seen in the cft computation of ref.@xcite . in particular , the linear rise of the entanglement entropy with time , and the scaling of the saturation time with the size of the system showing that the effective propagation speed of the entanglement was the speed of light .",
    "( among the many interesting features of such computations is the fact that the minimal surfaces involved must probe the region _ behind _ the apparent black hole horizon . )",
    "the goal of the work we report on was primarily two  fold .",
    "first , we wished to examine the question of higher dimensions , and so we used an ads@xmath0 setting , relevant to the study of dual 2 + 1 dimensional field theory .",
    "the question of how the entropy evolves in time and scales with the size of the system can be examined , and the physics of the growth of entanglement due to the propagation of quanta ought to be more interesting since there are more shapes available for region @xmath1 . we examine the physics of the infinite strip and the round disc and indeed see rather interesting physics to compare and contrast , again following an evolution after a thermal quench modeled by a four dimensional vaidya metric for gravitational collapse .",
    "a second issue we wished to address was how to do a different , non  thermal , type of quench in this ads / cft context , and to compare our results for it to the thermal case .",
    "we constructed a non  thermal quench by exciting electromagnetic sectors instead .",
    "there is a natural @xmath24 sector to which the physics couples and so starting with pure ads@xmath0 we study and evolution of a shell ( using a charged generalization of the vaidya metric ) which ultimately forms a zero temperature state at late times : an extremal black hole .",
    "so the quench is non  thermal , and the excitation in our new example is either by an external magnetic field or by a chemical potential for charge density , or an admixture of the two that can be freely dialed up using the four dimensional electric  magnetic duality of the four dimensional gravity system .    in section",
    "2 we give the general framework in which we are working , setting out our notation and the general form of the computation .",
    "we illustrate our methods by working out results for some familiar static geometries , re  deriving old results and adding some new ones ( those for the case of extremal dyonic black holes ) .",
    "section 3 presents our new results for the thermal quench in higher dimensions , where we notice several new features of the physics , including a kink in the time evolution of the entropy as it heads to saturation , for large enough system size .",
    "the case of the disc and the strip are thoroughly examined and contrasted .",
    "section 4 presents the electromagnetic quench , discussing again many new features seen for the case of the disc and the strip .",
    "we conclude in section  5 , and there is a brief appendix about the unitarity of the quench evolutions .",
    "in this section we present the setting for our computations of minimal surfaces in asymptotically ads@xmath0 geometries . we will present some examples of static test geometries in section 2.3 , with some familiar results and some new ones .",
    "this will allow us to set up notation and orient the discussion .",

    "we consider the area of a two  dimensional surface  @xmath20 that extends into the bulk that is joined to the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "we depict this in figure [ fig : setup_shapes](a ) .",
    "we parameterize the surface with coordinates : @xmath38 at @xmath39 , very near the ads boundary , ( @xmath40 is the uv cutoff of the dual field theory ) , the region @xmath1 will be chosen such that : @xmath41 with @xmath42 taken to infinity .",

    "we can write the following conservation equation : @xmath55 by taking the @xmath49derivative of this equation , and substituting for @xmath56 in the two equations of motion , we get a single equation : @xmath57 similarly , if we took the @xmath49derivative of the conservation equation , and substituting for @xmath58 in the two equations of motion , we get a single equation : @xmath59 the `` on  shell '' area is now given simply by : @xmath60      we may now consider the disc .",
    "we consider a disc of radius @xmath12 , and take the two dimensional surface @xmath61 , which we depict in figure [ fig : setup_shapes](b ) , to be parameterized by : @xmath62 by the rotational symmetry of the problem , we can consider an ansatz of the form : @xmath63 this gives for the area : @xmath64 because there is an explicit @xmath65 appearing in the lagrangian , we do not have a conserved quantity associated with the disc as we did for the strip",

    "we present the results for the strip and the disc .",

    "a new feature of this background is that the area integral exhibits a logarithmic divergence as @xmath123 approaches the event horizon .",

    "the contribution to the area of the pieces that fall towards the event horizon is given by : @xmath126 near the event horizon , we can write : @xmath127 and so we have : @xmath128 which contributes a logarithmic divergence to the area .",

    "@xcite to one dimension higher , performing a thermal quench",
    ". we will get several new results , and contrast them with several more new results that we obtain for a new , electromagnetic , holographic quench in a later section .",
    "the idea of the holographic quench studied in refs.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) is that the system is simply ads at early times , and then at some later time it is strongly perturbed by a shell of collapsing null dust , which subsequently forms a schwarzschild black hole at late times , representing a thermal state in the holographically dual theory@xcite .",
    "the point of the exercise is to study the evolution of the entanglement entropy over time after the quench .",
    "generically , it saturates after a characteristic time . in 1 + 1 dimensions the behaviour is rather simple , with a linear rise in the entropy followed by a distinct leveling off to saturation , as observed in a magnetically quenched system in ref.@xcite , and a thermally quenched system using holographic duality to asymptotically ads@xmath23 geometries in refs.@xcite .",
    "the slope of the line reflects the fact that the effects of the quench propagate at the speed of light in the single dimension available .",
    "we shall see more complicated possibilities in higher dimensions and in the next section when we do an electromagnetic ( non  thermal ) quench .    to achieve the quench , we consider : @xmath129 and take the following functional form for @xmath130 : @xmath131 this form for @xmath130 is such that the background is pure ads@xmath0 in the infinite past and an ads@xmath0schwarzschild black hole in the infinite future .",

    "the invariance of the early evolution suggests that regardless of how fast the quench is done , the early evolution is dictated by a time constant that is only dependent on the details of the plasma described by the dual 2 + 1 dimensional field theory .",

    "the system relaxes to its new state more slowly .",
    "exploring the behavior as we change the strip width @xmath100 , we note several things .",
    "first , the early evolution appears to be independent of ( or only weakly dependent on ) @xmath100 .",
    "this can be understood from the geometry of the strip .",
    "as @xmath12 changes , the area at the boundary of @xmath1 does not change , so the initial propagation of excitations from region @xmath1 to region @xmath2 , contributing to the entanglement , is not affected by the strip width .",
    "second , we see the appearance of a new phenomenon , the appearance of a swallow tail",
    ". see figure [ fig : thermal_vary_ell ] .",
    "the swallow tail is a feature of our numerical method for searching for minimal area solutions with a given uv and ir boundary condition at a given time @xmath146 .",
    "the method reveals the presence of multiple ( at times up to three ) solutions to the problem for a given time . by studying figure [ fig :",
    "thermal_zstar ] , we see that the multiplicity corresponds to the presence of solutions that have a @xmath147 below and above the apparent horizon .",
    "the solution is always the one with the lowest area , and therefore the transition leads to a kink in the entropy dependence on time .",
    "figure [ fig : transition_embeddings ] explicitly shows the three embeddings at the transition ; the transition is from an embedding with several sharp features to a smooth one .",
    "this kink in the evolution of the entanglement entropy is a striking new feature in time evolution .",
    "notice that the branch of solutions joined on to at late times are ones for which the turning point of the minimal surfaces , @xmath148 , is well above the final horizon , @xmath149 , giving an @xmath86 which is essentially the saturated late time value .",
    "in other words , the entropy reaches saturation and then abruptly flattens out for large enough strip size @xmath100 . for smaller strip size , the transition is also fast , but not so fast as to have a discontinuity in the derivative . since the rate of approach to saturation is not strongly dependent on the region size @xmath100 , while the saturation value itself depends on @xmath100 , it is reasonable to expect that upon nearing saturation , the evolution turns over and flattens out toward the saturation value . in cases where the saturation value increases fast enough with @xmath100 ( linearly with @xmath100 for the strip )",
    "while the rate of approach remains constant or weakly dependent on @xmath100 , this turnover will be more pronounced for large enough @xmath100 . in these large @xmath150 systems",
    "we are studying , this is , we presume , the role of the kink , which as we have seen appears for large enough @xmath100 . we expect that the sharp transition would be softened by @xmath151 corrections upon leaving the gravity approximation .",
    "our results suggest that the picture proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which arose in the 1 + 1 dimensional case , needs modification here . in their picture , the entropy is discussed in terms of left and right moving pairs in the field theory .",
    "saturation occurs once all pairs have had enough time to have traveled a distance of order the size of the interval . for our higher dimensional geometries",
    "we see saturation before all the analogous pairs are separated enough ( here for the strip , for example , there are directions for which pairs can travel for extremely long times before leaving the strip ) .",
    "this suggests that the entanglement entropy is not built from simple pairwise contributions for the higher dimensional cases under consideration here .",
    "the bulk of the contributions from those longer - traveling quanta must have been already accounted for , and the system nears saturation without them having departed the starting region .",
    ".,width=288 ]    turning to the intermediate time region where the entanglement entropy grows rapidly , we show in figure [ fig : thermal_t_sat_vs_ell ] ) the behavior of the saturation time for various @xmath100 . near @xmath152 ,",
    "the best fit line has slope 0.77 , yet for much larger @xmath100 , the slope is closer to 0.65 ( note that there is some flexibility in this number depending on how one defines the edges of the growth period to extract the saturation time @xmath153 ) .",
    "interestingly , therefore , it seems that the saturation rate for the thermal case grows faster for larger @xmath12 .",
    "this is traceable to the early time behaviour of the curves .",
    "see figure [ fig : thermal_vary_ell ] . for small @xmath100 ( _ _ i.e.__@xmath154 )",
    ", saturation is reached well before we enter the linear phase , so we may expect differences in the saturation time for those cases versus large @xmath100 .    it is important to note that our saturation time is a departure from the result of @xmath115 for the 1 + 1 cft result of ref .",

    "note that here the excitations do not necessarily travel a distance of order @xmath155 during this time .",

    "first , we see that the early evolution strongly depends on @xmath100 .",
    "once again , this can be understood from the geometry of @xmath1 .",
    "the region near the boundary of @xmath1 has a size that grows with @xmath12 and so the early evolution of the entanglement should reflect this dependence on geometry .",
    "another key difference from the strip case is that no matter how large @xmath100 is , we do not see the kink in the transition to saturation . in line with our reasoning from the previous section , the saturation value of the entanglement entropy and the rate of approach to saturation increase in lock with @xmath100 ( unlike for the strip where the rate was independent of @xmath100 ) allowing for a smooth evolution towards saturation .",
    "furthermore , we see that the saturation time grows linearly ( with a slope of unity ) with @xmath100 .",
    "this fits with the fact that the disc s finite extent in all directions means that there is a maximum travel time for any excitations as a result of the quench to leave @xmath1 and contribute to the entanglement entropy .",
    "so in this way we recover that the rate of saturation of the entanglement entropy is the speed of light , as was observed in lower dimensions . in this sense ,",
    "the disc is a more natural generalization of the 1 + 1 dimensional case than the strip .",
    "it is possible to cleanly study an entirely different type of quench in this system .",
    "this non  thermal quench is achieved by turning on electric and magnetic sources of the theory .",
    "we choose the system to be entirely non  thermal by approaching the extremal ( _ i.e. , _ zero temperature ) black hole solution at late times .",
    "the electric components of the background at late times can be read off as non ",
    "zero charge density and chemical potential in the dual 2 + 1 dimensional field theory@xcite , whilst the magnetic components represent a background magnetic field@xcite .",
    "in fact , electric  magnetic duality invariance of our system means that different choices of electric or magnetic sources can be rotated into each other , and we will often think of the system as undergoing a purely magnetic quench for convenience , but admixtures of electric ( chemical potential ) and magnetic ( background field ) quenches are captured by all of our results .",
    "the collapsing charged geometry has a metric similar to the extremal ads@xmath0 metric from the section [ section : dyonic ] , but with the function @xmath157 now taken to be : @xmath158 taking : @xmath159 we use the same quench profile for @xmath130 as that given in equation ( [ eqt : z0 ] ) .",
    "note that here @xmath132 sets the final strength of the magnetic field ( in the duality frame where we choose everything to be magnetic ) .",
    "we proceed in a similar fashion as in the case of the thermal quench .",
    "the area is given by equation  ( [ eqt : quench_area_strip ] ) , and we define the finite entanglement entropy @xmath86 by equation  ( [ eqt : quench_s_strip ] ) .",
    "let us consider first the effect of quench speed , set by @xmath144 .",
    "we present an example in figure [ fig : v0_effect ] . as with the thermal quench",
    ", it seems the general behavior of the entanglement entropy for small enough @xmath100 is qualitatively universal .",
    "when @xmath144 is small enough , it appears that the rise time to linear behavior does not depend on @xmath144 , suggesting that there is an intrinsic time scale for the dual plasma to react to changes in the medium , as in the case of one dimension fewer  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the time scale in the current system appears to be much smaller than that of ref.@xcite . as in the thermal case , for large @xmath144",
    ", the evolution of the entropy appears to follow the evolution of the quench rather closely .",
    "we consider the effect of strip size @xmath100 , presenting some results in figure  [ fig : ell_effect ] .",
    "the early time evolution is independent of @xmath100 just as we saw for the thermal case .",
    "furthermore , for large enough @xmath100 , there is again the appearance of a swallow tail , controlling the rapid flattening out to saturation .",
    "the resulting kink in the entanglement entropy has a similar origin to that discussed in section [ sec : thermal_strip ] , although in this case the situation is more severe since the rate of approach is slowed down by the logarithmic behavior .     and",
    "@xmath160.,width=288 ]    an increase in @xmath100 give an increases in size for the swallow tail , and eventually the transition occurs even before the beginning of the swallow tail region is ever reached .",
    "see an example in figure [ fig : ell=5 ] .",
    "a new important feature is a departure from the linear behavior of the evolution to a logarithmic growth .",
    "this behavior is inherited from the logarithmic behaviour we saw in the static extremal case in section [ section : dyonic ] , which has its origin in the double zero at the horizon . on the dual field theory side , this means significantly new behaviour for the excitations as they propagate after the quench .",
    "presumably , the charged excitations are slowed down by electromagnetic interactions , either from screening in the presence of non  zero charge density or due to propagation in the background magnetic field .     and @xmath161",
    ". the intermediate time behavior of the area is well approximated by @xmath162 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the second embedding to which the system transitions , showing entanglement saturation.,width=288 ]    we can study how the saturation time @xmath163 depends on @xmath100 .",
    "we present these results in figure  [ fig : t_sat_vs_ell ] .",
    "we find that the slope of the line near @xmath152 is approximately 0.77 ( note again that the slope depends slightly on how one decides to calculate @xmath163 because of the roundedness of the solution before it saturates ) , which matches our earlier result for the thermal quench . upon reaching the point where the jump between embeddings starts to occur",
    ", the growth in @xmath164 appears to be well fitted with an exponential from that point onwards ( to be expected from the logarithmic growth of the area with time that we commented on earlier ) .     for @xmath160 .",
    "the slope near @xmath152 is approximately 0.77.,width=288 ]      we proceed in a similar fashion as in the case of the thermal quench .",
    "the area is given by equation  ( [ eqt : area_disc ] ) , and we define the finite entanglement entropy @xmath86 by equation ( [ eqt : tilde_s_quench_disc ] ) .",
    "we present some results in figure [ fig : quench_disk_results ] .",
    "again , the early evolution has strong @xmath100 dependence in a manner attributable to the disc geometry . also present",
    "is the logarithmic evolution , arising from the near horizon region of the geometry .",
    "furthermore , for large enough @xmath100 , there is an appearance of the swallow tail .",
    "recall that this was absent for the thermal quench for the disc . in line with the discussion in section [ sec : thermal_strip ] , its appearance here is due to the slowing ( as opposed to increasing in the thermal case ) rate of approach to saturation with increasing @xmath100 due to the logarithmic behavior .",
    "we have studied two types of quench for the ( 2 + 1)dimensional theory dual to ads@xmath0 , computing the evolution of the entanglement entropy for an infinite strip region and a round disc region .",
    "our quenches were a thermal quench dual to a shell of uncharged matter ( which forms a schwarzschild black hole ) and a non  thermal quench , formed from a shell of charged matter ( which we tuned to form an extremal ( _ i.e. , _ zero temperature ) dyonic black hole .",
    "we observed several interesting phenomena .",
    "the results for the disc , for the thermal quench , provided the most direct analogue of earlier observed results from ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions@xcite : there was linear growth in time of the entanglement entropy on its way to saturation , with a slope consistent with the interpretation that the quanta responsible for entanglement were propagating with the speed of light .",
    "the strip deviated from this in two ways .",
    "the first , that the effective growth rate ( while still linear ) was slower than the disc s was naturally attributable to the semi  infinite geometry of the strip .",
    "the second was more surprising . for large enough strip size there was a kink in the entropy  time curve corresponding to a rapid turnover at saturation .",
    "the source of this on the geometry side is quite natural ( it is due to the availability of multiple branches of candidate minimal surface solutions , forming a swallow tail shape  there is a jump from one branch to another at late enough times ) , but it would be interesting to understand its origins on the field theory side .",
    "the kink suggests a modification of the picture proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereby not just entangled pairs contribute to the entanglement entropy .",
    "( note that it is probable that such a kink gets softened beyond the supergravity approximation . )",
    "the kink is also present for both the disc and the strip for the electromagnetic quench .",
    "one of the features of our novel quench is that the entanglement entropy grows only logarithmically with time , a feature that may be due ( on the field theory side ) to screening effects for the charged quanta .",
    "it is interesting that kinks appear when the effective propagation speed contributing to the entanglement entropy growth is subluminal for both thermal and electromagnetic cases , being absent for the thermal quench disc case .",
    "we do not know if this is a coincidence , but are encouraged to pursue further study of this issue .    in interpreting our results",
    ", we have assumed that the prescription to calculate the entanglement entropy is correct .",
    "new features like the kink have been discussed from this point of view ( see section [ sec : thermal_strip ] ) .",
    "we recognize that , until a better understanding of the prescription is obtained , it is possible that the kink may be interpreted as pathological , indicating a breakdown of the prescription to calculate the entanglement entropy for rapid quenches and large system size .",
    "the logarithmic growth is again something that would be interesting to understand further on the field theory side . on the gravity side it comes from surfaces that probe near the extremal horizon , which has a double zero in the metric function .",
    "a throat opens up at the horizon , producing a smooth geometry that is ads@xmath165 .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that for our electromagnetic quench , the growth of entropy in the intermediate region might be captured by an effective lower dimensional theory captured by ads@xmath166 physics , as has been shown to happen for aspects of the physics of studying fermi surfaces holographically in a related context@xcite .",
    "ta would like to thank stephan haas for sparking our interest in this work and for various useful discussions .",
    "ta and cvj would also like to thank hubert saleur , silvano garnerone , rob myers and mukund rangamani for useful discussions and comments as well as esperanza lopez for clarifications about aspects of ref.@xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the us department of energy .",
    "in order to show that the evolution of the quench and subsequent relaxation process is unitary , we would like to show that throughout the evolution the following condition is satisfied : @xmath167 it is useful to start with some static examples before considering an evolving background .",
    "let us begin with the case of pure ads@xmath0 . to compute @xmath168",
    ", there are two possible surfaces to consider @xcite , which we depict in figure [ fig : b_embeddings ] .",
    "the embedding in figure [ fig : b_embedding1 ] can be shown to be divergent by first considering it to be a sum of two finite intervals and then sending the outer edges of the intervals to infinity .",
    "the embedding in figure [ fig : b_embedding2 ] has a piece that gives @xmath169 and the contribution from the piece at @xmath170 is zero .",
    "therefore , we find that ads@xmath0 corresponds to a pure state .",
    "let us now consider a static schwarzschild black hole . repeating the calculation described above",
    ", we find that the second piece of figure [ fig : b_embedding2 ] must lie not at @xmath170 but at @xmath171 , the horizon .",
    "because of this fact , its contribution gives a non ",
    "zero value ; in fact it gives an entropy of : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the area of the event horizon .",
    "therefore , we find that @xmath174 , and so the system is not in a pure state .",
    "therefore , any static solution with an event horizon corresponds to a mixed state ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "so let us now consider our evolving metric .",
    "if we consider a solution that corresponds to the embedding of figure [ fig : b_embedding2 ] , a solution to the equations of motion for the second disjoint piece is to simply have : @xmath175 we note that for @xmath176 , our metric does not have a singularity at @xmath177 , so there is no danger for the solution to lie there . in particular , this solution is ( in a sense ) simply the solution that we would get for ads@xmath0 and gives zero contribution to the entropy .",
    "the first piece will give us the entropy of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , for the evolving case , we find that we have : @xmath178 note that this only works because we are assuming the second piece remains static in the sense that it remains at @xmath179 whereas the other piece evolves .",
    "therefore , with this in mind , we find that the evolution is unitary .",
