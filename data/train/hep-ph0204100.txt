    "the standard model ( sm ) is the most successful model to explain physics below the weak scale .",
    "the recent results for @xmath0 or @xmath1 by belle @xcite and babar @xcite are converging , and they are consistent with the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism @xcite . also , the precision measurements of the electroweak parameters suggest the light sm higgs boson such as @xmath2gev ( 95%cl ) @xcite .",
    "now we are waiting for signature of physics beyond the sm .",
    "we have the clue for the physics beyond the sm in the neutrino oscillation experiment results .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino result by the superkamiokande experiment is established @xcite .",
    "the combined result of the superkamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite experiments shows a strong evidence for the appearance of @xmath3 or @xmath4 in the solar neutrino . at present , the large - angle msw solution is the most favored , which will be checked by the kamland experiment soon @xcite .",
    "these neutrino oscillation results can be explained by introduction of small neutrino masses .",
    "introduction of small neutrino masses gives us a new scenery for physics beyond the sm . while the promising candidate for origin of the small neutrino masses is the see - saw mechanism @xcite by introduction of the right - handed neutrinos , the atmospheric neutrino result implies that the right - handed neutrino mass should be smaller than @xmath5gev , which is much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "this is a good motivation for introduction of supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "a quadratically - divergent contribution to the higgs boson mass proportional to the right - handed neutrino masses should be canceled even if the correction proportional to the planck mass is vanishing by some mysterious physics .    nowadays ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one the most promising extension of standard model ( sm ) , and many experiments are searching for the possible evidence of the low - energy supersymmetry . in this review",
    "we discuss the possibilities in physics of charged lepton , paying attention to the dipole - moment operators ; @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are for the generation .",
    "these operators are sensitive to physics beyond the sm .",
    "the real diagonal parts of @xmath9 and @xmath10 contributes to the anomalous magnetic moments of charged leptons , @xmath11 .",
    "they are sensitive to structure of the higgs sector , since the operator ( [ dipole ] ) is violating the lepton chiral symmetry and the su(2)@xmath12u(1)@xmath13 symmetry .",
    "in fact , the mssm may predict the larger correction to it than the electroweak correction since the mssm has two doublet higgs bosons .",
    "if non - vanishing @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( @xmath14 ) exits , the charged lepton - flavor violating ( lfv ) processes , such as @xmath15 , are predicted ; @xmath16 .",
    "now we know from the neutrino oscillation results that the lepton - flavor symmetry is not exact in nature , and the problem is how large is the charged lfv .",
    "the small neutrino masses themselves , expected from the neutrino oscillation results , can not give any prediction for the charged lfv processes accessible in near future .",
    "in the mssm , the charged lfv is supplied by the susy breaking masses of sleptons , and the magnitude depends on the origin of the susy breaking and interaction beyond the mssm , such as in see - saw mechanism or the supersymmetric grand unified models ( susy guts ) .",
    "when diagonal parts of @xmath9 and/or @xmath10 have imaginary part , cp is violating and the electric dipole moments ( edm ) are predicted ; @xmath17 .",
    "the edms are also supplied by the susy breaking slepton masses in the mssm .",
    "we organize this review as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the current status of the muon @xmath18 . in section 2",
    "we discuss dependence of the charged lfv processes on the susy breaking models , and show the branching ratios of the charged lfv processes in the supersymmetric see - saw model , using the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "section 3 is for the edms of charged leptons .",
    "section 4 is summary .",
    "the latest result for the anomalous magnetic moment of muon ( bnl98&99+cern77 @xcite ) is @xmath19 , while the sm prediction is @xmath20 the contents of the sm contribution are listed in table  1 .",
    "the deviation of the measurement from the sm prediction is @xmath21 , and it is @xmath22 away . at present",
    "the significance of the deviation is small .",
    "the experimental error is expected to be improved by a factor 2 in bnl00 data , and the ultimate goal may be @xmath23 .",
    ".the sm contribution to the muon @xmath24 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the minimal susy su(5 ) gut , the predicted edms are very small .",
    "the quark and lepton masses are given by the up - type and down - type quark yukawa couplings at the gut scale .",
    "as the result , the edms of electron and muon are proportional to a jarskog invariant , @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 is the ckm matrix at the gut scale .",
    "this situation is similar to the sm .",
    "thus , the edms are suppressed so much .",
    "we know that the minimal susy su(5 ) gut can not explain the quark and lepton masses for the first and second generations , and the extension is needed . also , it does not have the right - handed neutrinos . these extension may change the prediction for the edm drastically @xcite .",
    "let us consider that the susy su(5 ) gut with the right - handed neutrinos . in this case , the edm of electron ( muon ) may be proportional to a jarskog invariant , @xmath27 $ ] . here",
    ", we assume for simplicity that the right - handed neutrino masses are degenerate and @xmath28 is the mns matrix at the gut scale .",
    "the relative phases between @xmath28 and @xmath26 contribute to the edms . in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 ] ) we show the @xmath29 and the edms of electron and muon .",
    "we asuume the maximal cp violating phases .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for the input parameters in this figure .",
    "since the left - handed and right - handed sleptons get the lfv masses as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath29 and the edms have a strong correlation . from this figure",
    "it is found that the prediction may be accessible in the future experiments , and @xmath32 is an important parameter for the electron edm .",
    "and the edms of electron and muon in the susy su(5 ) gut with the right - handed neutrinos . ]    in the supersymmetric see - saw model , if the right - handed neutrino masses are exactly degenerate , the edms of charged leptons are also suppressed , similar to the minimal susy su(5 ) gut .",
    "the non - degeneracy of the right - handed neutrino masses may enhance the edms drastically @xcite , and the muon ( electron ) edm can reach to @xmath33 cm .",
    "other cp violating observable in the lepton sector is the t - odd asymmetry in the polarized muon decay to @xmath34 .",
    "while it comes from interference between the photon - penguin diagram and the @xmath35 penguin and box diagrams , the photon - penguin diagram tends to be dominant in the @xmath36 process and the t - odd asymmetry is suppressed . in the minimal susy",
    "su(5 ) gut and the supersymmetric see - saw model the t - odd asymmetry may reach to 10% if the photon - penguin contribution is suppressed @xcite@xcite .",
    "in this review we discuss physics of the lepton sector from viewpoints of the minimal supersymmetric standard and the extensions .",
    "while the muon @xmath24 is sensitive to the mssm , the understanding of the systematic error in the the sm prediction , especially the light - by - light contribution , is very serious when the experimental error is reduced furthermore .",
    "the charged lfv processes depends on the susy breaking models and the lfv interaction beyond the mssm .",
    "the current neutrino data is encouraging",
    ". the interesting future experiments may give suggestion for the model discrimination .",
    "the edms of charged leptons are sensitive to the extension of the susy guts , and they may be accessible in the future experiments .",
