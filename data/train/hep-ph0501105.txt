    "the light flavor scalar mesons present a remarkable exception for the constituent quark model and the structures of those mesons have not been unambiguously determined yet @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the strong overlaps with each other and the broad widths ( for the @xmath5 , @xmath1 et al , the widths are comparatively narrow ) make their spectra can not be approximated by the breit - wigner formula .",
    "the numerous candidates with the same quantum numbers @xmath6 below @xmath7 can not be accommodated in one @xmath8 nonet , some are supposed to be glueballs , molecules and multiquark states .",
    "the more elusive things are the constituent structures of the mesons @xmath5 and @xmath1 with almost the degenerate masses . in the naive quark model , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; while in the framework of four - quark models , the mesons @xmath5 and @xmath1 could either be compact objects i.e. nucleon - like bound states of quarks with symbolic quark structures @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite , or spatially extended objects i.e. deuteron - like bound states of hadrons , the @xmath5 and @xmath1 mesons are usually taken as @xmath13 molecules @xcite .",
    "the hadronic dressing mechanism takes the point of view that the mesons @xmath5 and @xmath1 have small @xmath8 cores of typical @xmath8 meson size , the strong couplings to the hadronic channels enrich the pure @xmath8 states with other components and spend part ( or most part ) of their lifetime as virtual @xmath14 states @xcite . in the hybrid model ,",
    "those mesons are four - quark states @xmath2 in s - wave near the center , with some constituent @xmath15 in p - wave , but further out they rearrange into @xmath16 states and finally as meson - meson states @xcite .",

    "the lightest state is the non - strange isosinglet ( @xmath34 ) , the heaviest are the degenerate isosinglet and isovectors with hidden @xmath35 pairs while the four strange states lie in between @xcite .    in this article , we take the point of view that the well confirmed @xmath5 and @xmath1 mesons are four - quark states @xmath2 in the ideal mixing limit , and devote to determine the values of their masses @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the framework of the qcd sum rules approach @xcite .",
    "detailed studies about the other scalar four - quark states ( the @xmath38s are not confirmed yet ) and the mixing between the two isoscalars ( the @xmath5 meson and the broad @xmath39 meson ) will be our next work .",

    "in the four - quark models , the structures of the scalar mesons @xmath5 and @xmath1 in the ideal mixing limit can be symbolically taken as @xcite @xmath40 the four - quark configurations of the @xmath6 mesons can give a lot of satisfactory descriptions of the hadron phenomenon , for example , the mass degeneracy of the @xmath5 and @xmath1 mesons , the mass hierarchy pattern of the scalar nonet , the large radiative widths of the @xmath5 and @xmath1 mesons , the @xmath41 to @xmath42 decay .",
