    "development of analytic theory of freak ( or rogue ) waves is one of the most interesting problems of hydrodynamics . in spite of recent progress in this area",
    "@xcite many important questions are not answered yet .",
    "apparently , freak waves are the structures well localized in space , see fig.[sat ] . but",
    "behavior of freak waves in time in co - moving coordinate frames is not still explored . from the experimental viewpoint",
    "this is a hard question .",
    "it can not be answered by a resting observer , for whom the freak wave is just a single event localized in time , see fig.[draupner ] . from the other hand ,",
    "satellites move too fast to record the full `` live story '' of a freak wave .",
    "the standard model for description of freak waves in deep water is nonlinear schrdinger equation ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this equation has a plethora of exact solutions which often are associated with the freak waves on deep water .",
    "some of these solutions are presented in @xcite , more recent developments can be found in articles @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these solutions , however , presume existence of background monochromatic wave ( condensate ) and are connected to the subject of our paper only indirectly . for this reason , we do not pursue a purpose to present here the detailed description of all solitonic solutions on the condensate background , as well as completed and controversial history of their discovery . in this article",
    "we study the solitons on almost zero background .     ]",
    "however , we should mention the remarkable @xmath1 solution found by peregrine @xcite .",
    "this solution in the co - moving coordinate frame is an instanton , describing the single event  appearance and disappearance of the freak waves group .",
    "today we can speak about two alternative versions of the freak wave theory .",
    "the `` instantonic '' version assumes that the freak wave is a single event , localized in time .",
    "the `` solitonic '' version proposes that the freak wave are described by persistent solitons , probably oscillating in time .",
    "so far experimental data are too scarce to make a conclusion in favor of one of these theories .",
    "one should remember that @xmath1 is derived in the assumption that the wave train size , containing the freak waves , is much larger than characteristic wave length .",
    "most of collected experimental data , however , show that in the real ocean this condition is not satisfied ( see fig.[sat ] , [ draupner ] ) and that the @xmath1 is hardly applicable .",
    "a level of nonlinearity of quasi - monochromatic wave group is measured by the characteristic steepness @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the wavenumber and @xmath4 is the amplitude ) .",
    "our numerical experiments @xcite show that @xmath1 is applicable if @xmath5 . according to our calculations ,",
    "@xmath1 is not applicable if @xmath6 .",
    "recent numerical experiments @xcite show that this limit might be extended to @xmath7 .",
    "however , for freak waves in the real sea @xmath8 ( see appendix ii ) . the @xmath1 is absolutely not applicable for description of that steep freak waves .",
    "it is also known from observations @xcite that a typical configuration of a freak wave group consists of three sequent waves  `` three sisters '' .",
    "this group is too short to be described by @xmath1 .",
    "what are the alternatives to @xmath1 model ?",
    "the most consistent approach is the use of the exact euler equations for description of the potential flow of the ideal fluid with free surface .",
    "some advances in this direction are already achieved @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the study of more simple and less accurate models also could be very useful . in this article",
    "we present our result on numerical solution of well - known @xmath0 @xcite equation with the special choice of parameter @xmath9 , making this model well adjusted for description of surface gravity waves .",
    "our results mostly support the `` solitonic '' theory of freak waves .",
    "we started with initial data , corresponding to @xmath1 solitons and discovered formation of persistent quasisolitons existing for more than two thousands of wave periods .",
    "these quasisolitons slowly radiate energy in backward direction .",
    "as was shown recently @xcite in the `` model case '' ( @xmath10 ) , this effect plays the key role in formation of the wave turbulent spectrum , but in our case its influence is negligibly small .    however , we discovered completely new effect .",
    "while quasisolitons of small steepness ( @xmath11 ) behave similar to @xmath1 solitons on zero background , the quasisolitons of higher steepness demonstrate almost periodic oscillations of amplitude and spectral shape , periodically forming power - like tails in spectra .",
    "this effect can be explained by modulational instability inside the quasisoliton .",
    "development of this instability leads to formation of `` weak '' one - dimensional collapses , which deform the spectrum , but absorb negligibly small amount of energy .",
    "thereafter we call oscillating quasisolitons `` quasibreathers '' .",
    "the majda - mclaughlin - tabak ( @xmath0 ) equation ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the complex function and the fractional derivative is defined by @xmath14 has been attracting lately fare attention of nonlinear wave scientists .",
    "the reason is @xmath0 equation incorporates several already known important cases , and also can be used as a `` test - bed '' for verification of the concepts like weak - turbulent waves spectra , localized structures and their co - existence @xcite , @xcite . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 eq .",

    "these approximate moving solutions , radiating energy in the backward direction are called quasisolitons after paper @xcite .",
    "as it was recently shown in @xcite , @xcite , quasisolitons play the central role in wave turbulence in the frame of @xmath0 model if @xmath47 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "it was shown that in this case the backward radiation plays the central role in dynamics of quasisolitons .",
    "but we study only the case @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath20 . in this case , which intentionally models the gravity waves on deep water , the backward radiation is not that strong , due to essential nonlinearity suppression in the area of small wave numbers .",

    ", the surrounding weakly - nonlinear noise could consists not only of radiation at wavenumber @xmath129 , but also of the products of the initial condition decay into quasibreather and other waves . however , the wave action density in this noise is so small with respect to energy density in quasibreather , that this noise certainly can not be interpreted as a kind of `` condensate '' .    to analyze this situation , we performed the following experiment . in the middle of the simulation",
    "the real - space , containing quasibreather and surrounding noise , was `` cleaned - up '' through zeroing the function @xmath130 everywhere except the carrier domain of the quasibreather . as a result ,",

    "this observation lead us to the conjecture that quasisolitons and quasibreathers exist only in quasi - equilibrium with weakly nonlinear wave noise environment .",
    "another important observation , which distinguishes quasibreathers from oscillations of perturbed @xmath1 solitons , is periodical singularity formation at every time quasibreather reaches its maximum .",

    "the similarity of observed quasibreather in terms of water surface elevation with experimental `` three sisters '' wave packet and numerically observed freakon shows that even simplified model of gravity surface waves as @xmath0 catches significant properties of the original exact equations .",
    "on the base of numerical experiments we see that quasisolitons in frame of defocusing @xmath0 model with parameters @xmath67 , @xmath48 and @xmath131 are robust long - living objects , existing for hundreds of leading wave periods .",
    "quasisolitons of large amplitude turn to quasibreathers .",
    "their amplitude and spectral shape oscillate in time .",
    "these oscillations are accompanied by formation of weak collapses which can be compared with `` white capping '' of real ocean waves .",
    "we conclude that the `` solitonic '' scenario of freak waves is based on the equal foot with alternative `` instantonic '' scenario .",
    "we need to perform more numerical experiments in the frame of exact euler equation to establish what scenario is closer to reality .",

    "<S> we report numerical detection of new type of localized structures in the frame of majda - mclaughlin - tabak ( @xmath0 ) model adjusted for description of essentially nonlinear gravity waves on the surface of ideal deep water . these structures  </S>",
    "<S> quasibreathers , or oscillating quasisolitons  can be treated as groups of freak waves closely resembling experimentally observed `` three sisters '' wave packs on the ocean surface . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 model has quasisolitonic solutions . unlike @xmath1 solitons , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 quasisolitons are permanently backward radiating energy , but nevertheless do exist during thousands of carrier wave periods . </S>",
    "<S> quasisolitons of small amplitude are regular and stable , but large - amplitude ones demonstrate oscillations of amplitude and spectral shape . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be explained by periodic formation of weak collapses , carrying out negligibly small amount of energy . </S>",
    "<S> we call oscillating quasisolitons `` quasibreathers '' .    nonlinear schrdinger equation , solitons , freak waves , singularities , breathers </S>"
