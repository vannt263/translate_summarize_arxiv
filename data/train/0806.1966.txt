    "the process of carrier multiplication ( cm ) consists of the generation of more than one electron and hole after absorption of a single photon in a semiconductor , its effectiveness determined by a rich interplay of the interactions between charge carriers , phonons and light.@xcite from a practical perspective , though , its chief potential as an enabler of more efficient solar spectrum harvesting in energy conversion devices has been limited by the very weak cm of bulk materials.@xcite the topic of cm has however reemerged in recent years due to reports of very strong enhancements of the cm process in nanocrystalline semiconductors .    enhanced cm was first reported for pbse and pbs nanocrystals ( ncs ) by schaller et al .",

    "@xcite using the transient absorption ( ta ) technique .",
    "work on this material system has been extended , with one report inferring the creation of up to 7 e - h by a single high energy photon based on pump - probe data , @xcite and a study suggesting that the enhancement occurs not only for ncs in solution but also in close - packed films relevant for potential device applications .",
    "@xcite other material systems have also been explored , with work initially showing evidence for strong cm as well in cdse , @xcite inas , @xcite and si ncs .",
    "@xcite    since then , there have been several reports observing little or no cm . using a transient photoluminescence experiment , we found no evidence for cm in cdse ncs at energies well above previously reported thresholds .",
    "@xcite more recently , pijpers et al .",
    "have reported difficulty in reproducing their observation of cm in inas @xcite , and a new study has reported no observable cm in inas / cdse / znse ( core / shell / shell ) ncs .",
    "@xcite in addition , there remain several unresolved questions pertaining to cm in lead chalcogenide ncs .",
    "for instance , there are significant qualitative and quantitative differences between the schaller et al .",
    "reports@xcite of strong cm following a universal trend with @xmath2 and the ellingson et al .",
    "results@xcite which appear to show a distinct particle size dependence and smaller yields , in some cases by factors of @xmath3-@xmath4 .",
    "second , considerable theoretical debate about cm in ncs remains , mostly due to a lack of information about intraband relaxation processes deep in the exciton and biexciton manifolds .",
    "@xcite recognizing this deficiency , allan and delerue have allowed for a wide range of intraband relaxation rates in their flexible theoretical framework , but still find the largest cm yields reported by schaller et al . difficult to accommodate .",
    "@xcite overall , these outstanding issues suggest the need for continuing the assessment of cm in lead chalcogenide nc samples .    in this work we study carrier multiplication in pbse and pbs nanocrystals using transient photoluminescence ( tpl ) , a technique that more specifically informs on the e - h pair population within ncs than the pump - probe methods commonly employed .",
    "@xcite we first characterize the exciton and multiexciton pl signatures in these materials using low photon - energy excitation .",
    "we find that pbse and pbs ncs , when adequately surface passivated , have flat exciton population dynamics over a 1ns window . at higher excitation power ,",
    "strong features appear with fast @xmath5-@xmath6 decay lifetimes attributed to biexcitons .",
    "after these calibration steps , we measured tpl decays to look for evidence of cm using excitation at @xmath7 , well above previously reported cm energy thresholds for the nc materials in this study .",
    "@xcite although we distinctly observe a signal consistent with cm for all of our pbs and pbse nc samples , the cm yields we estimate , defined as the average number of _ additional _ e - h pairs generated per absorbed photon , by @xmath8 . ]",
    "reach only @xmath9 even when @xmath10 .",
    "these values are significantly lower than those of previous reports.@xcite    in the final section we explore the issue of comparing cm yields between ncs of different sizes and with the bulk .",
    "we show that if nanoscale - specific physics , such as potentially slowed intraband relaxation , are not _ a priori _ assumed , one would expect cm yields to depend only on the incident photon energy , regardless of the particle s size .",
    "this suggests that cm yields be compared on an absolute photon energy basis .",
    "revisiting the literature in this framework shows that the reports on pbs and pbse ncs to date do not uniformly suggest very large enhancements of the underlying cm physics when compared to what has been reported@xcite for bulk pbs .",
    "pbse and pbs ncs were prepared by high temperature pyrolysis of pb and se / s precursors in an oleic acid / octadecene mixture.@xcite the growth solutions were purified by a single precipitation , redispersed in hexane , and transferred to 1 mm path length quartz cuvettes in a nitrogen glovebox .",
    "the resulting samples , with optical densities of @xmath11-@xmath4 at @xmath12 , were sealed and taken out into air for subsequent measurements .",
    "as will be described below , some samples of larger particles ( first absorption feature @xmath13 ) were treated with cd@xmath14 by adding a few drops of cadmium oleate to the hexane nc dispersions at room temperature .",
    "all samples were magnetically stirred during acquisitions , and pl decays under weak @xmath12 excitation were periodically monitored to check for any degradation . a typical sample s absorption spectrum is shown in fig . [ fig_absorption ] .",
    "absorption spectrum of a typical pbse nc sample used in this study .",
    "the nc bandgap @xmath15 is determined as the peak of the first absorption feature . ]",
    "transient photoluminescence decays of the samples were collected using a fluorescence upconversion apparatus based on an amplified ti : sapphire system operating at 250khz .",
    "a portion of the pulse train was passed through a bbo crystal to generate excitation sources at 3.1 ev and 1.55 ev which were separated with two dichroic mirrors and focused on the sample to spot sizes of roughly @xmath16 m and @xmath17 m diameter respectively .",
    "emission was collected in a front - face geometry using off - axis parabolic mirrors and focused onto another bbo crystal . following a variable delay ,",
    "the rest of the @xmath12 pulse train was overlapped with the collected emission and the resulting sum frequency generation was separated spatially and spectrally using interference filters and a monochromator .",
    "the signal was detected with a cooled pmt and amplified using a lock - in amplifier .",
    "for these experiments , the pulse width was maintained relatively long by tweaking the amplifier compressor away from its optimal short - pulse configuration to avoid excess noise from continuum generation in the mixing crystal .",
    "we have nevertheless maintained a time resolution better than @xmath18 ps as measured from the rise time of the tpl signal . because the peaks of the exciton and multiexciton pl were not found appreciably different within our spectral resolution , all decays for a given sample were acquired at a fixed wavelength .",
    "we began by characterizing the pl dynamics of single excitons ( x ) in pbs and pbse ncs using weak @xmath12 excitation .",
    "in general , samples of small and moderate sized ncs had flat pl dynamics over the full temporal range of our instrument ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_xdecay ] ) .",
    "in contrast , as - prepared cdse core particles almost invariably show significant sub - nanosecond dynamics , attributable to trapping by defects .",
    "@xcite the flat decays we observe in these pbse and pbs samples suggest good surface passivation of ncs prepared by these methods,@xcite and are consistent with the very high luminescence quantum yields reported in the literature .",
    "@xcite in addition , we also measured the pl dynamics over a much longer window for one of our pbs samples using an ingaas amplified photodiode and found a nearly single exponential fluorescence decay with a @xmath19 lifetime , consistent with previous studies.@xcite    the pl dynamics of larger as - prepared particles , those with @xmath20 , typically showed multiexponential x decays with large sub - nanosecond components , suggesting poor surface passivation .",
    "moreover , these dynamics steepened irreversibly upon exposure to @xmath7 radiation . in an attempt to remove non - radiative pathways and to stabilize the particles",
    ", we chose to apply a mild cd@xmath14 treatment to the ncs .",
    "addition of cadmium oleate to hexane dispersions of @xmath21 pbs and @xmath22 pbse ncs resulted in nearly flat single - exponential x decays and robustness to prolonged @xmath23 irradiation , while causing no noticeable changes in the absorption spectra and emission wavelength of the samples .",
    "our measurements also suggest that surface treatment of these samples does not have much effect on cm yields .",
    "we studied one sample of fairly large @xmath24 pbse ncs that did not require cd@xmath14 treatment , and found that its estimated cm yields were similar to the other large nc samples that were treated with cd@xmath14 .",
    "we also checked the effect of the cd@xmath14 treatment by applying it to nc samples that already exhibited adequate surface passivation and found no significant change of the biexciton lifetime or estimated cm yield .",
    "we have chosen to carry out further studies only on samples that show flat tpl decays over our experimental timescale , whether as - prepared or cd@xmath14-treated , because the interpretation of subsequent results is considerably simplified .",
    "a multiexponential x decay entails an inhomogeneous distribution of nc surface passivation which can then support a nontrivial distribution of multiexciton lifetimes , @xcite complicating both the isolation of mx features in tpl decays and the quantification of the underlying exciton and multiexciton populations .",
    "the second and more serious problem was that the x decays of samples with poor surface passivation tended to change irreversibly when exposed to @xmath7 for the lengths of time necessary to obtain adequately clean data with our apparatus .",
    "for these reasons we focused only on well - passivated samples .",
    "it is conceivable that cm yields might depend on the details of the nc surface .",
    "if so , the results of this work may be difficult to generalize beyond the constraints of our particular sample preparation and selection methods .",
    "strong excitation pulses can create biexcitons ( bx ) and further multiexcitons in ncs by sequential photon absorption . an excitation power series for our @xmath25 pbse sample",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_800series]a , showing the growth of a large fast feature , which we attribute to the bx , on top of the single x dynamics .",
    "these decays are well described as the sum of a slow x component and a fast bx component , @xmath26 with fixed lifetimes @xmath27 and @xmath28 . under strong excitation ,",
    "additional faster components appear , attributable to emission from higher multiexcitons .- excited decays by a time @xmath29 to minimize unwanted interference from higher mx tpl components in the determinations of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . ]",
    "the rapid @xmath32 decay times are due to an auger - like relaxation mechanism @xcite and the rates we measure are consistent with those measured by pump - probe techniques . and @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 pbse ncs respectively , while beard et al.@xcite have determined @xmath36 for @xmath34 and schaller et al.@xcite report @xmath37 for @xmath38 . ]",
    "our method for estimating cm yields,@xcite described in the next section , relies importantly on an accurate calibration of the link between observed tpl decays and the underlying bx and x populations soon after excitation .",
    "this information can be summarized in the quantity @xmath39 , the ratio of the sizes of the bx and x tpl decay components expected in the hypothetical case that all ncs are initially excited to the bx state , i.e. when the bx is saturated . in fig .",
    "[ fig_800series]b , we fit the observed exponential components , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , to population profiles assuming poissonian photon absorption statistics .",
    "the power series of x and bx features are found consistent with this assumption , and we are able to estimate sample - dependent @xmath39 values in the range of 2.5 - 4 .",
    "this implies that the radiative rate of the biexciton , @xmath40 , is @xmath41 times greater than @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , the numbers are similar to those observed for cdse ncs , where we proposed that the enhanced @xmath40 could be due to spin substructure since the lowest x fine structure state in cdse is known to be dark @xcite but the ground state bx is predicted to be bright .",
    "@xcite however , it has been suggested that no such spin structure is necessary to explain the long x emission lifetimes of lead chalcogenide ncs.@xcite in such a scenario , a simple accounting of all the possible electronic configurations of band - edge x and bx assuming known selection rules and thermal equilibrium gives @xmath43 , which is consistent with our results .",
    "a derivation can be found in the appendix , along with an explanation of the relationship between @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath42 , and a description of our population profile modeling .",
    "we turn now to studying tpl decays under @xmath7 excitation",
    ". photons of this energy are well above the cm thresholds that have been previously reported for pbs and pbse ncs .",
    "@xcite if carrier multiplication occurs in our samples , it would be reflected in the tpl dynamics as a residual bx or higher mx component that persists in the limit of very weak excitation , when at most one photon is absorbed per nc .",
    "[ fig_400vs800]a compares pl dynamics for @xmath34 pbse ncs under @xmath12 and @xmath7 excitation .",
    "as described previously , weak @xmath12 excitation results in flat , single exponential dynamics corresponding to x decay , while at higher power the tpl traces exhibit a fast bx component as well .",
    "in contrast , even at low fluence , excitation at @xmath7 results in decays with a fast component closely following bx dynamics . fig .",
    "[ fig_400vs800]c shows the @xmath44 ratios obtained from a series of measurements with varying @xmath7 excitation fluence .",
    "our extrapolation shows that the bx - like feature persists in the zero power limit ( @xmath45 ) , and we thus attribute it to cm .",
    "the cm yield , @xmath46 , for the sample is then given by : @xcite @xmath47 because our best estimates of @xmath48 are in the range @xmath49 , cm yields are smaller by a factor of @xmath50 than the simple ratio @xmath44 would suggest .",

    "[ fig_400vs800]b and [ fig_400vs800]d display similar data for a sample of larger @xmath35 pbse ncs .",
    "the sample exhibits a bigger fast component in the @xmath45 limit , and therefore a larger cm yield of @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "we have studied a number of pbs and pbse nc samples in this way and find @xmath46 always in the range of @xmath55 even in samples for which @xmath56 . as is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_pbxcmvserel ] , our cm yield estimates are significantly lower than those previously reported by other researchers for their pbs and pbse nc samples .",
    "schaller et al .",
    "report a universal dependence of cm yields on @xmath57 , predicting cm yields of up to @xmath3 additional e - h pairs at @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite ellingson et al .",
    "do not observe such structure in their data , but instead report cm yields that appear to depend on particle size . @xcite the ellingson et al .",
    "data fall bellow the universal curve of schaller at al . by a factor of roughly two , while our own best estimates of the cm yields are an additional factor of 2 - 3 smaller .",
    "it should also be noted that the findings of schaller et al .",
    "predict not only bx formation , but also triexciton ( tx ) yields of 0.5 and 1 for our largest samples when excited at @xmath7 .",
    "however , our data fits very well to only a bx and an x component .",
    "any appreciable tx would have been evidenced in our measured decays since the tx decay dynamics are within our experimental time resolution and the tx emission peak is expected to be close to that of the x and bx because of the approximate 8-fold degeneracy of the lowest lead chalcogenide nc electron and hole states .    since our numerical results are in disagreement with the previous reports based on ta techniques , we consider here possible sources of error in our cm estimates .",
    "in fig . [ fig_pbxcmvserel ] we show estimated @xmath59 confidence intervals for @xmath60 related to noise in the experimental decays .",
    "these uncertainties in @xmath46 are all smaller than @xmath61 and are likely unbiased .",
    "the part of our methodology most susceptible to a systematic error is the saturation ratio of the bx to x tpl components , @xmath39 .",
    "any multiplicative error in this quantity translates directly into a multiplicative error in the cm yield . in our study , we have estimated @xmath39 by fitting the sizes of x and bx decay components under @xmath12 excitation to a population profile and then assuming that this saturation ratio should apply as well to biexcitons created by a cm process . using these @xmath39 values of @xmath62-@xmath63 , we have determined cm yields in the range of @xmath64-@xmath65 . for our results to roughly match the magnitudes of cm reported by ellingson et al .",
    "we would have had to use much smaller values @xmath66 , with an even further reduction to @xmath67 required to achieve agreement with the schaller et al .",
    "however , using such small @xmath68 would be inconsistent with our direct observation of @xmath69 under sufficiently strong excitation conditions",
    ". we are therefore confident in our principal conclusion that the cm yields in the pbse and pbs nc samples we have studied are significantly smaller than those previously reported for the pbx material system .      in this section",
    "we seek to establish a basis for comparison of cm yields between nc samples of different sizes and with the bulk material .",
    "it has been common to compare cm yields at the same scaled energies @xmath2 .",
    "this practice follows precedent from the bulk impact ionization literature and is useful when considering device applications .",
    "however , aside from providing a convenient way to show data from different materials on a single plot , the physical basis for such comparisons is not obvious",
    ". it may not transparently lead to answers of some basic questions , like whether or not nanoscale - specific phenomena have a large effect on cm .",
    "in general , the cm yield for a material system ( for example , cdse or pbs ) is expected to be determined both by particle size and the photon energy , @xmath70 , which can be recast as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the size - dependent bandgap .",
    "much of the existing nc cm literature infers an important role for nanoscale physics from the fact that their estimates of @xmath46 are much larger than reports for @xmath73 when compared at the same relative energy @xmath2 .",

    "explore how @xmath70 behaves if all phenomena exclusive to the nanoscale are neglected . in the bulk limit it is intuitively clear that @xmath70 is independent of @xmath80 .",
    "the competing processes of intraband relaxation and impact ionization have the same rates for crystals of , say , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , resulting in the same cm efficiency . to understand why the impact ionization rate remains constant",
    "one can start from the first - order perturbation theory formulation : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the coulomb interaction and @xmath85 is the density of two electron , two hole states ( corresponding to a bx ) at the energy @xmath86 of the initial one electron , one hole configuration ( which corresponds to x in an nc ) .",
    "a reduction in volume has two effects .",
    "first , the average coulomb coupling is enhanced , with @xmath87 . might appear surprising at first .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this square matrix element is averaged over _ all _ 2e2h configurations of nearby energy . however , for @xmath88 , conservation of momentum and spin must be satisfied and one of either the initial electron or hole must not change state . the proportion of final 2e2h states that violate these conditions and thus have @xmath89 increases with volume , ultimately resulting in a stronger volume scaling of @xmath90 than would be expected from averaging only the non - zero terms .",
    "] however , this is fully balanced by the reduction in average density of states ( dos ) , since @xmath91 .",
    "if no new physics are introduced , this process of shrinking the bulk can be continued into the nanoscale with the important conclusion that for @xmath75 above the @xmath92 energy conserving threshold , @xmath93 .",
    "it must be kept in mind that even though the spacing between energy levels is certainly larger in ncs , the dos averaged over sufficiently wide intervals is the same as in the bulk , with volume scalings @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we should only expect a divergence from @xmath96 if new physics appear in the nanoscale that have a strong influence on the cm process .",
    "this suggests that comparisons between nc and the bulk should be made on an absolute photon energy basis as long as @xmath75 is well above the energy - conserving limit . then the difference @xmath97 would be attributable specifically to nanoscale phenomena .",
    "in contrast , the usual literature comparison at fixed @xmath2 can significantly exaggerate enhancement over the bulk simply because @xmath98 , so that , for instance , even without novel nc physics , pbse and pbs ncs with @xmath99 will appear to show at least a two - fold cm threshold reduction .",
    "it is noted that from a practical perspective , bulk - like cm in ncs does indeed present a real advantage because the extra carriers can be extracted at a higher voltage difference @xmath100 .",
    "also , a @xmath2 basis is useful in comparing a sample s actual cm to the maximum possible imposed by energy conservation .",
    "however , it is not obvious that a comparison of how near two _ different _ samples are to their separate energy - conserving limits can usefully inform on differences in their underlying physics .",
    "for that , we argue that the absolute photon energy basis appears to be more appropriate .    in light of these considerations ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_cmvse]a a summary of literature data on pbs and pbse ncs @xcite replotted on an absolute energy axis along with values of cm yields in bulk pbs films reported by smith and dutton .",
    "@xcite these authors studied the photoconductivity of commercial pbs films and found an increase in photocurrent response at shorter wavelengths which they attributed to a cm process , emerging from a threshold @xmath101 and rising approximately linearly to @xmath102 at @xmath103 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that there are numerous potential sources of error in this bulk cm determination , some of which we detail later , but it is nevertheless interesting to note that the cm yields for ncs reported in the literature appear only modestly enhanced over these bulk values . except in the case of",
    "very large ( small @xmath72 ) ncs following the universal curve of schaller et al . , cm yields are within a factor of @xmath104 of the bulk report , and exhibit a similar cm energy threshold between @xmath3-@xmath105 . figure [ fig_cmvse]b shows our own estimates compared to the nc and bulk literature data at @xmath106 plotted against @xmath100 .",
    "our results are below the bulk cm reported value , those of ellingson et al .",
    "@xcite appear consistent with it , and the schaller et al.@xcite results fall well above for larger ncs .",
    "reaching a robust conclusion at this stage on the relative strengths of cm in bulk and nc forms is difficult because of potential uncertainties in the bulk values reported smith and dutton .",
    "first , the authors did not present a characterization of the commercial pbs films studied , and it is possible that significant oxidation may have taken place since no protective coating was used .",
    "@xcite this is important since exposure to @xmath107 is known to cause significant changes in bulk pbs photoconductivity .",
    "@xcite second , the reported yields are very sensitive to any systematic errors in determining the number of photons absorbed by the film .",
    "the third complication is the possible variation of photoconductive gain with @xmath75 .",
    "for example , at blue wavelengths carriers are generated on average closer to the film surface , where the greatest concentration of trap states are expected to reside .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to say _ a priori _ whether the gain would increase or decrease .",
    "these considerations highlight the need for a careful determination of cm in bulk films of pbs and pbse before a definitive comparison with ncs can be made . with the data at present",
    "it is difficult to conclude that nanoscale phenomena are responsible for strong cm enhancement , as we have discussed in the previous paragraph and in fig .",
    "[ fig_cmvse ] .    given the possibility that cm in ncs might follow largely bulk - like physics , it is interesting to examine what is known about the nc - specific physical mechanisms that could affect the multiplication process .",
    "the most commonly cited rationalizations of cm enhancement in ncs are the possibility of strong coulomb interaction and slow intraband relaxation .",
    "@xcite it could be argued , for example , that coulomb couplings are significantly enhanced in the nanoscale based on the much faster auger relaxation rates of band - edge multiexcitons compared to the bulk .",
    "this enhancement of auger rates at the band edge is thought to be due to a relaxation of momentum conservation requirements brought about by the finite nature and abrupt surface of ncs.@xcite however , because momentum conservation is not a limiting constraint on impact ionization in the bulk at high excess kinetic energies,@xcite and it is not clear that the nanocrystalline form should still exhibit significant enhancement .",
    "calculations by allan and delerue suggest that @xmath108 is if anything smaller in pbse ncs than for the bulk .",
    "@xcite    similarly , there is still no evidence of a phonon bottleneck for intraband relaxation at high electron and hole kinetic energies .",
    "due to practical considerations relating to experimental time resolution , most studies on ncs have focused only on relaxation from some of the lowest excited states to the band edge .",
    "@xcite even then , they find very fast picosecond relaxation times .",
    "moreover , at the high excess kinetic energies required for cm , the x manifold is much denser and it seems less likely that a phonon bottleneck effect could play a very large role .    the remaining potential nanoscale cm enhancement mechanisms have to do with the discrete state structure .",
    "certainly , the discrete nature of states in a nc is critical near the energy conservation threshold , as no cm can occur when @xmath109 even though the bulk 2e-2h dos is finite .",
    "however , if we restrict our attention to @xmath110 well over @xmath92 , as has been the case when large cm yields have been reported , @xcite it is plausible that the bx manifold is sufficiently dense that bulk - like behavior could result .",
    "further , even if there were deviations , we would not expect them to be monotonic in either @xmath100 or @xmath110 .",
    "finally , it is possible that there could be strong coupling between x and bx,@xcite but not enough is known about phase and population relaxation mechanisms of carriers with high kinetic energies to conclude that such effects would be important for cm .    all these arguments above should not be taken as proof or justification that @xmath111 for ncs , but simply to show that such a conclusion would not be inconsistent with what is experimentally known about nc photophysics .",
    "too little is understood about the physics of highly energetic carriers in ncs to make strong _ a priori _ predictions of the role of nanoscale phenomena in cm .",
    "the principal experimental conclusion of this work is that cm yields in our pbse and pbs nc samples estimated by transient photoluminescence are well below the values that have been reported in the literature for pbse and pbs ncs using transient pump - probe techniques.@xcite it should be noted that these previous reports themselves show significant numerical disagreement between each other even though they employ nominally similar methods . in broad terms , the variation between the reports of schaller et al . , ellingson et al . , and our own must ultimately stem from either systematic differences in data acquisition procedures , variation in the way cm is determined from observed decays , or actual sample - to - sample differences of the cm efficiency .",
    "the fact that ellingson et al . and schaller et al .",
    "use nearly equivalent methods for estimating cm but find conflicting results suggests that their samples are inherently different , or that the two groups handled these samples differently during the course of their experiments . in our own work there is a possibility of systematic error related to the calibration method we use , but we have argued above that this alone can not readily account for the contrast with the existing literature .",
    "the answer may yet lie in sample - to - sample cm variation , and if so would suggest that cm in ncs is strongly affected by defects or surface ligand type and coverage .",
    "the second effort of this work has been to establish a basis for comparing cm efficiencies in ncs and the bulk that more clearly isolates the effects of changes in underlying physics . we have argued that an absolute photon energy basis is more appropriate than the usual @xmath2 approach for this purpose , and by comparison to values reported for the bulk , we found that the cm yields reported for ncs do not immediately suggest a very large role for nanoscale - specific phenomena . because these bulk values themselves could be beset by large errors , it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion .",
    "a modern , robust , assessment of cm in bulk pbs and pbse will be necessary for this to be possible .",
    "similarly , understanding the variation in the nc cm literature will require applying multiple experimental methodologies to identical nc samples or , more importantly , the development of new spectroscopic techniques that are more specifically taylored to multiexciton detection than the population - dynamics based measurements in use at this time .",
    "a clear picture of the cm process in the transition from the bulk to the nanoscale will have to wait for experimental efforts on these two fronts .",
    "as has been described in detail in our previous work on cdse ncs,@xcite the exponential components in a tpl decay can be related to the mx and x populations immediately following excitation through the following approximate expressions : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the population of ncs that start with at least an exciton or a biexciton respectively at time 0 .",
    "these populations are given by @xmath115 , where the population of the @xmath116-th multiexciton state , @xmath117 , is determined by poisson statistics , taking into account excitation beam inhomogeneity and position dependent collection efficiency : @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the photon flux and collection efficiency at position @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the absorption cross section .",
    "@xmath123 is the average number of photons absorbed per pulse by an nc located at @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath122 were known , it would be possible to compute the @xmath117 up to a common proportionality constant and obtain , by comparison with experiment , the saturation ratio @xmath39 , the value of @xmath44 when @xmath124 . however , both @xmath119 and especially @xmath120 are difficult to determine accurately in our apparatus .",
    "instead , we exploit the fact that the shape of @xmath125 as a function of excitation power fully determines the shape of @xmath126 . to see this",
    ", we note that during any of our experimental power series @xmath123 only changes in magnitude while retaining its shape .",
    "setting @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a fixed shape and @xmath129 is a constant parameter , one can show that : @xmath130 in the above , @xmath129 can be replaced with any quantity proportional to it , such as average excitation power , so knowledge of the absorption cross section is not required .",
    "therefore , if one finds any @xmath128 and @xmath120 so that the calculated @xmath131 closely fits the shape of the observed @xmath30 excitation series , then the @xmath132 calculated with the same @xmath128 and @xmath120 will be proportional to @xmath31 . the results of this procedure , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_800series]b , demonstrate that the @xmath31 we observe match very well the trend we independently predict from the @xmath30 evolution , further supporting our assignment of this fast component in the tpl to the biexciton .",
    "our estimate of @xmath39 is then obtained as the ratio of the proportionality constants relating @xmath30 to @xmath125 and @xmath31 to @xmath126 .",
    "we find saturation values @xmath39 of 2.5 - 4 using this method .",
    "since @xmath133 , the corresponding values of @xmath134 are in the range 3.5 - 5 .",
    "we present here a calculation of @xmath135 for a simple model of the lead chalcogenide ground state .",
    "the @xmath136 and @xmath137 states in lead chalcogenide are eight - fold degenerate .",
    "there are four equivalent valleys in the band structure and two - fold spin degeneracy .",
    "the possible x electronic configurations can be labeled @xmath138 , and the bx configurations @xmath139 , where @xmath140 . because total momentum and spin must be conserved during an optical interaction , only the recombination of an electron and hole with the same @xmath116 and same spin is allowed . assuming that particle momentum and spin remain good quantum numbers , each electron state is connected by a dipole transition to exactly one of the eight hole states . by symmetry , these transition dipole moments all have the same magnitude @xmath141 .",
    "we can then calculate the radiative square transition dipole of each x and bx microstate . in the case of x , there are 8 configurations of type @xmath142 with @xmath143 , and @xmath144 of type @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "similarly , for the bx , there are @xmath147 configurations like @xmath148 with @xmath149 , @xmath150 configurations of type @xmath151 with @xmath143 , and @xmath152 dark @xmath153-type states . taking the thermal average",
    ", one finds @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and therefore @xmath156 .",
    "this result should remain approximately valid even in the presence of perturbations that mix states with different quantum numbers or couple the electrons and holes , as long as the width of the resulting energy fine structure is sufficiently smaller than the available thermal energy , @xmath157 ."
