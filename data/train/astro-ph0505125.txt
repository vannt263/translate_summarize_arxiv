    "a tentative detection of absorption ( with a fwhm of 100 ) towards 3c48 was reported by pihlstrm ( 2001 ) .",
    "high - resolution vlbi observations show that most of the radio emission is extended ( wilkinson et al .",
    "1991 ; worrall et al .",
    "only 10% of the flux density at 1.53 ghz is in the collimated core - jet structure with only 1% of the flux density being associated with the radio core that is coincident with the optical point source .",
    "thus the tentative detection of 21 cm absorption by pihlstrm ( 2001 ) , if true , has to be towards the extended radio emission .",
    "our deep gmrt observations fail to reveal any detectable 21 cm absorption at the systemic redshift of 3c48 as well as the gas responsible for uv absorption lines ( fig .",
    "[ 21 cm ] ) . at the resolution of the gmrt observations",

    "we obtain the 3@xmath7 upper limit on optical depth to be in the range of 0.001 to 0.003 .",
    "we obtain an upper limit on average n(h  i ) across the radio source using @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the peak optical depth , @xmath10 the line fwhm in , @xmath11 the spin temperature in k. using the measured 3@xmath7 upper limit on @xmath12 ( instead of @xmath9 ) we get n(h  i)@xmath131.8@xmath14@xmath15 for @xmath16 = 0.001 and assuming @xmath11=100 k and @xmath10=100 .",
    "this is consistent with low n(h  i ) measured towards the optical point source .",
    "however , it should be noted that due to the extended nature of the radio source , low - resolution observations will fail to detect the presence of high n(h  i ) gas in front of say knot b ( at about 0.3 kpc from the compact core a : see worrall et al .",
    "2004 ) , near which the jet gets disrupted .",
    "knot b has a 1.53 ghz flux density of 250 mjy that is @xmath17 of the total flux density .",
    "this then implies that log @xmath18(h  i )  ( @xmath15 ) @xmath19 21.30 along our line of sight towards knot b. thus our gmrt observations can not rule out the presence of high column density towards individual knots or compact features .",
    "the uv spectra show clear evidence of blue - shifted gas with = 0.3654 . compared with",
    "= 0.3700 this corresponds to a modest outflow velocity of @xmath0 1000 .",
    "we can further constrain the location of the outflowing material by comparing the absorption features with the emission lines . from fig .",
    "[ emabs ] , we can conclude that the members of the doublet have optical depths consistent with a full coverage of the background source . as , ly@xmath1 and o  vi absorption lines are detected on top of the emission lines ( see fig .",
    "[ covel ] ) complete coverage means that the gas is outside the broad - line region ( blr ) and has a projected size more than that of the blr ( see srianand & shankaranarayanan 2000 ) .",
    "we estimate the radius of blr ( r@xmath20 ) using the empirical relation @xmath21 obtained by corbett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using the reverberation mapping technique .",
    "the quasar rest frame luminosity at 5100   ( i.e. l@xmath22 ) is calculated using the observed flux density of f(8780 )=8.03@xmath2310@xmath24 ergs s@xmath25 @xmath25 @xmath15 , estimated from the stis data set ( 05ab1030 , program i d 8299 ; see table  [ uvtab ] ) and a spectral index of 1.0 . substituting the numerical value of @xmath3l@xmath22 = 3.28@xmath2310@xmath26 ergs s@xmath25 in equation  ( [ rblr ] ) , the radius of blr is estimated to be 0.25 pc . therefore we can conclude that size of the absorbing cloud should be larger than 0.5 pc and at least 0.25 pc away from the central engine .    in the following subsections we discuss the physical properties of the outflowing absorbing gas and explore the possibility that these might be affected by the interaction with the radio jet .",
    "the observed column densities of different species can be used to obtain physical conditions of the absorbing gas . as @xmath27for the outflowing material ,",
    "it is most likely that the ionization state of the gas will be influenced by the radiation field of the quasar .",
    "in addition , jet - cloud interaction can also play an important role in determining the observed kinematics and ionization state of the gas in radio sources .",
    "first we consider the case of the absorbing gas in photoionization equilibrium with the uv radiation from 3c48 .",
    "for this purpose , we run grids of photoionization models using cloudy ( ferland 1996 ; ferland et al .",

    "we present the results of our calculations in fig .",
    "[ modfig ] as a function of the dimensionless quantity , the ionization parameter u , which is defined as @xmath28 is the number of hydrogen ionizing photons per unit time , @xmath29 is the frequency corresponding to the lyman edge and r is the distance from the central source . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ modfig ] we plot different column density ratios as a function of u. the vertical short dashed line in the right hand side of the figure marks the upper limit of u ( i.e. log  u@xmath301.18 ) . here",
    "we use the fact that n(h  i)/n(h ) can not be less than 10@xmath31 .",
    "the constraint on the total hydrogen column density , n(h ) , comes from the chandra observations of worrall et al .",
    "they find no evidence for any intrinsic absorption in excess of 5@xmath14 @xmath15 in the direction of 3c48 .",
    "a conservative lower limit of log  u=@xmath321.82 is obtained from the column density ratios n(n  iv)/n(n  iii ) and n(s  vi)/n(s  iv ) . from fig .",
    "[ modfig ] , it is apparent that the ratio n(c  iv)/n(n  iv ) is independent of u when log  u@xmath331.0 . as the gas is optically thin our choice of n(h  i ) and solar abundance ratios , z@xmath5 will not alter these constraints .",
    "the observed ratio of n(c  iv)/n(n  iv ) is @xmath00.1 dex below the predictions of our model .",
    "this is within the measurement uncertainties of our data .",
    "therefore , within the measurement uncertainties , [ n / c ] is very close to solar values .",
    "this is in contrast with the systematically higher supersolar [ n / c ] ratios observed in most of the qsos , especially the ones at high redshift or having high luminosities ( hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 , 1999 ; petitjean & srianand 1999 ) .",
    "the rapid star - formation models enhancing the nitrogen abundance by the secondary cno nucleosynthesis have been used to explain the [ n / c]@xmath34[n / c]@xmath5 ratios in these high redshift / luminosity systems . using the observed flux density , f(1246.7)=3.13@xmath35 erg s@xmath25 @xmath15 @xmath25 from the iue data , a luminosity distance of 1950.7 mpc and a spectral index of @xmath36=0.5 , we estimate the luminosity , @xmath37l@xmath38 , at 1450    for 3c48 to be 3.5@xmath2310@xmath39  l@xmath5 . from fig .",
    "7 of hamann et al .",

    "[ modfig ] , we plot the predicted values of column densities of various species as a function of u. horizontal lines mark the observed values . clearly , observed column densities of and are lower by @xmath00.5 dex compared to the model predictions within the allowed range of ionization parameter . as the absorbing gas is optically thin , this difference can be accounted for by lowering either the value of n(h  i ) or the metallicity .",
    "the allowed range of n(h  i ) listed in table  [ tcol ] , constrains the metallicity of the absorbing gas to be in range 0.1@xmath4z",
    "/ z@xmath5@xmath41.3 .",
    "the column density of as predicted by the photoionization models is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the column density estimated from the possible detection of this line .",
    "reconciliation of the observed value requires neon abundance enhancement or opstulating regions with different levels of ionisation ( multiply - ionized regions ) .",
    "since the rest of the observed species can be explained by solar abundance ratios it seems unlikely that only ne has an unusual abundance .",
    "thus the possible detection of in the poor signal - to - noise ratio fuse data can be understood by the existence of multiply - ionized regions .",
    "such multiply - ionized regions have been used to explain the observed column densities of highly ionised species ( including ) in j2233@xmath32606 , um675 and 3c288.1 ( petitjean & srianand 1999 ; hamann et al .",
    "1997 ; hamann et al .",
    "thus it is possible that the low - ionization species originate from the high - density ( low - ionization ) phase and high - ionization species originate from the low - density ( high - ionization ) phase of the absorption - line system .",
    "our data does show some evidence that the absorption - line system consists of a number of components .",
    "however , due to low spectral resolution and poor signal - to - noise ratio it is difficult to say if arises from the same component as the other low - ionization species .",
    "the density of the absorbing gas or its distance from the quasar nucleus can , in principle , be constrained using equation  ( [ equ ] ) if either of these two quantities and @xmath40 are known .",
    "we estimate the luminosity at the lyman limit , @xmath41 erg s@xmath25 hz@xmath25 in the quasar rest frame using the observed flux density , f(1246.7)=3.13@xmath35 erg s@xmath25 @xmath15 @xmath25 from the iue data , a luminosity distance of 1950.7 mpc and a spectral index of @xmath36=0.5 .",
    "this translates into q(h@xmath42)=1.3@xmath43 photons s@xmath25 . substituting numerical values in equation  ( [ equ ] )",
    "then gives @xmath44 taking a nominal value of log  u=@xmath321.5 from the photoionization models , nr@xmath45 = 1.2@xmath46 @xmath47 pc@xmath48 , where r@xmath49 is the distance from the central source in parsecs .",
    "however , with the available information , it is not possible to get useful estimates of these parameters . assuming that the absorbing cloud was pushed outwards by the radio jet @xmath5010@xmath6 yr ago ( cf .",
    "section 5.2 ) , it would have travelled @xmath50100 pc with a velocity of @xmath0 1000 km s@xmath25 .",
    "this implies that the number density n@xmath1310@xmath6 @xmath47 .      the complex radio structure of 3c48 has led to suggestions that the jet in 3c48 may be disrupted by strong interaction with the external medium ( e.g. wilkinson et al .",
    "1991 ; feng et al .",
    "this is not surprising as csss tend to be more asymmetric in both the separation ratio ( r@xmath51 ) , defined to be the ratio of the separation from the core / nucleus of the farther component to the nearer one , and the flux density ratio ( r@xmath52 ) , defined to be the ratio of integrated flux densities of the farther to the nearer component , compared with the larger sources , suggesting interaction with an asymmetric distribution of gas in the central regions ( saikia et al .",
    "1995 , 2001 ) .",
    "the component nearer to the nucleus often tends to be the brighter one , which is possibly a signature of the expansion of nearer component through the denser environment leading to higher dissipation of energy .",
    "orientation effects can also lead to substantial enhancements in these observed asymmetry parameters ( cf .",
    "jeyakumar et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) . using the images and core position as given by feng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who have recently reported the detection of a counter - jet in 3c48 , the separation ratio for the prominent northern peak n2 and the counter - jet s is @xmath272.8 .",
    "this could increase to @xmath275 if the region of enhanced intensity in the outer region is taken instead of n2 .",
    "the flux density ratio ( r@xmath52 ) of the northern or approaching components to the southern one , s , lies between @xmath0200 and 400 for observations at different frequencies and with different resolutions ( feng et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the source also appears significantly misaligned , possibly due to collision with clouds of gas and also exhibits jitters in the direction of the ejection axis as seen in the vlba 8-ghz image of worrall et al .",
    "the misalignment angle , defined to be the supplement of the angle formed at the core by n2 and s is about 30@xmath53 . for an inclination angle of 30@xmath3235@xmath53 for the jet , estimated from the relative strength of the core , and an intrinsic misalignment of @xmath010@xmath3215@xmath53 , r@xmath51 is in the range of @xmath03.8 to 5 for a velocity of advancement of @xmath00.5c . the corresponding flux density ratio , r@xmath52=r@xmath54 ( e.g. scheuer & readhead 1979 ; blandford & knigl 1979 ) is in the range of @xmath050@xmath32100 for a spectral index of 0.9 , which is lower than the observed flux density ratio by at least a factor of @xmath03 .",
    "this difference could be attributed to intrinsic asymmetries in the gas distribution ( cf .",
    "mccarthy , van breugel & kapahi 1991 ) . using the formalism of eilek & shore ( 1989 ) and gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1991 )",
    ", we estimate the density ratio on opposite sides to be @xmath07 .",
    "however , these numbers should be treated with caution because of the complex structure of the source and uncertainties in some of the basic parameters such as the velocity of advancement .",
    "the detection of blue - shifted absorption lines caused by clouds of gas in the path of the radio jet would be an indication of jet - cloud interaction .",

    ", they suggest that this gas contains the imprint of interaction with the jet .",
    "the kinematical properties of this blue - shifted emission line gas , which shows clumpy morphology and has an outflow velocity of @xmath0580 , are similar to the one detected in absorption . using the mass estimate of @xmath56m@xmath5 ( fabian et al .",

    "this is similar to the outflowing velocity of @xmath01000 for the blue - shifted material seen in absorption .",
    "although blue - shifted absorption can be caused by other physical processes like radiative acceleration , the kinematical similarities with the emission - line gas and the situation in 3c48 make jet - cloud interaction a likely possibility .",
    "the interaction with the jet can impart momentum to the gas and can also heat as well as ionize it .",

    "considering the similarity of the kinematics of the emitting and absorbing material and the physical situation in 3c48 , it is possible that the outflowing material detected in absorption may have also interacted with the radio jet .",

    "<S> we report the detection of a = 0.3654 associated absorption - line system in the uv spectrum of the css quasar 3c48 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorbing material is blue shifted with respect to the quasar emission - line redshift , = 0.3700 , suggesting an outflow velocity of @xmath01000 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect absorption lines over a range of ionization states from ly@xmath1 , ly@xmath2 , c  iv , n  iv , s  vi to o  vi and possibly o  iv and ne  viii . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematical properties of the absorption - line system are similar to the blue - shifted emission line gas seen in [ oiii ]  @xmath35007 ( chatzichristou , vanderriest & jaffe 1999 ) , which is believed to have interacted with the radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> we study the properties of the absorbing material using cloudy and find that photoionization models with solar abundance ratios ( with overall metallicity in the range 0.1@xmath4z / z@xmath5@xmath41.3 ) are enough to explain the observed column densities of all the species except , detection of which requires confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> since the cooling and recombination time for the gas is @xmath010@xmath6 yr , the consistency with the photoionization models suggests that any possible interaction of absorbing material with the jet must have taken place before @xmath010@xmath6 yr . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance ratio of nitrogen to carbon is close to solar values , unlike in the case of most quasars , especially at high - redshifts , which have super - solar values . </S>",
    "<S> we observed 3c48 with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) to search for redshifted 21 cm absorption . </S>",
    "<S> however , we did not detect any significant feature in our spectra and estimate the 3@xmath7 upper limit to the optical depth to be in the range 0.001 to 0.003 . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the diffuse nature of the radio source , optical depths as high as 0.1 towards individual knots or compact components can not be ruled out .    </S>",
