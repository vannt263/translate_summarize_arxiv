    "continuous time markov processes with discrete variable have been used to model phenomena over a wide range of fields , such as biology , ecology and stoichiometry  @xcite . among them , the system with infinite - state - level represented by a birth - death process have been well studied , however one often encounters the situation where the state - level is finite , such as spike activity of neurons or chemical reaction systems .",
    "recently , a phase - transition like phenomenon caused by the stochastic noise as represented by the autocatalytic reaction system and the foraging behavior of ants has attracting attentions  @xcite , where the qualitative behavior of the system changes drastically as the system size becomes small .",
    "these stochastic processes are described by the master equation , however it is in general difficult to analyze the master equation directly .",
    "therefore , one has to resort to an approximation scheme to analyze the system .    a well - known approximation scheme to the master equation is the fokker - planck approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approximation is able to capture the noise - induced bimodality in the model of foraging behavior of ants  @xcite .",
    "however , the fokker - planck approximation is a continuous approximation to intrinsically discrete variables , and it was pointed out that the method may fail to capture some kind of feature of the stochastic system  @xcite .",
    "another method , which retains discreteness of the system , is to use the creation and annihilation operators for boson , initiated by doi and peliti  @xcite . in this formalism , various statistics can be represented by the boson coherent state path integral , and this formalism gives a framework to apply various methods developed in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , the doi - peliti formalism was applied to a biochemical reaction system and models of spike activity of neurons  @xcite . however , the doi - peliti formalism is originally the method to treat the infinite level systems such as growth of bacteria or variations of animal populations , and it seems to be not appropriate to treat a finite - level system using this formalism .",
    "in fact , thermodynamic limit was taken in the application to the spike activity of neurons , on the assumption that the number of neuron in each population is infinite  @xcite .",
    "such a thermodynamic limit may again lose some features of the stochastic system , and the finite - size effect could not be estimated correctly .",
    "therefore , an approximation scheme which captures the finite - size effect appropriately is desired .",
    "therefore in this paper , we propose a method to treat discrete stochastic processes with finite - state - level .",
    "for this purpose , we use a representation of su(2 ) lie algebra .",
    "we found that by employing an appropriate normalization of state vectors in hilbert space the master equation of the system can be rewritten as a time evolution equation for the state vector corresponding to the probability generating function .",
    "then , the generating function is expressed as a propagator of the spin coherent state .",
    "we derive the spin coherent state path integral representation for the generating function .",
    "a similar formulation was shown previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , however we use a different representation of su(2 ) algebra .",
    "we study the linear susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) epidemic model with arbitrary time - dependent transition probabilities as a simplest application to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method .",
    "we employ two approach , wei - norman theorem and path integral representation , to calculate the generating function .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : algebra ] , we show how the discrete stochastic system with finite - state - level can be re - expressed by using a representation of su(2 ) algebra . in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] , we study the stochastic linear sis epidemic model as a simplest application of our method . sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion .",
    "the system of our interest consists of single population with @xmath0 individuals .",
    "each individual can take two discrete states .",
    "for example , the two states correspond to firing and quiescent states in the model of spike activity of neurons , and susceptible and infected states in epidemic model .",
    "thus , @xmath0 individuals are divided into two classes .",
    "the state of the system at a given time @xmath2 is represented by a discrete variable @xmath3 with @xmath1 state - level , which takes @xmath4 .",
    "time - evolution of the system is assumed to be a continuous time markov process with asynchronous updating , that is , only one individual changes the state during infinitesimal time interval . given a state transition probability from @xmath5 to @xmath6 per unit time @xmath7 ,",
    "the probability with the state @xmath5 at time @xmath2 is described by the following master equation ,",
    "@xmath8 expressing the excitation and de - excitation probabilities for each individual as @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , the master equation is expressed as @xmath11 f(n-1 ) p(n-1,t)-(n - n)f(n ) p(n , t ) \\notag \\\\ & + ( n+1)g(n+1 ) p(n+1,t ) -n g(n ) p(n , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath12 .",
    "it is in general difficult to analyze the master equation directly .",
    "therefore , we first consider to rewrite the master equation to more tractable form .",
    "in fact , by using a representation of su(2 ) algebra , the master equation can be rewritten as a time evolution equation for the state vector .",
    "though su(2 ) algebra is very familiar in the field of quantum mechanics , we once again illustrate the algebra here for the purpose of emphasizing the difference to the previous study  @xcite and quantum mechanical systems .",
    "su(2 ) algebra is defined by the three generators satisfying the following commutation relations , @xmath13 = 2 j_z , \\\\ & [ j_z , j_{\\pm } ] = \\pm j_{\\pm } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are called raising and lowering operators .",
    "next , we introduce the lowest - weight state @xmath16 , which has a normalization @xmath17 and satisfies the action @xmath18 .",

    "then , the action of the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the state @xmath20 is respectively given by @xmath24    here , we define the state vector corresponding to the probability distribution @xmath25 as @xmath26 as we will see , this state is nothing but the probability generating function .",
    "then , using the action of the operators eq .",
    "( [ eq : operation ] ) , we can rewrite the master equation to a time - evolution equation of this state vector @xmath27 : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the identity operator and we have defined the hamiltonian @xmath31 of the time evolution .    the formal solution of the time evolution equation eq . ( [ eq : time evolution ] ) is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the time - ordered product and @xmath34 is a time - evolution operator satisfying the following differential equation @xmath35      in this section , we discuss how various statistics of the probability distribution can be calculated from the state vector @xmath36 . in quantum mechanics , the expectation value of a physical quantity is given by an inner - product of the corresponding operator with respect to the state vector .",
    "on the other hand in stochastic system , the statistics is given by an inner - product of the corresponding operator with respect to the projection vector , as defined in the following .",
    "first , noting the orthonormalization relation @xmath37 , the normalization condition of the probability distribution is calculated by the following inner - product , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the projection vector . then given the state vector @xmath27 , the expectation value of certain function @xmath40 is given by the inner - product of the corresponding operator @xmath41 as @xmath42 for example , the probability generating function @xmath43 , which corresponds to @xmath44 , is calculated as @xmath45 where the operator @xmath46 is defined by the taylor expansion , @xmath47 . in the same way , the moment generating function , which corresponds to @xmath48 ,",
    "is calculated as @xmath49    seeing from a different perspective , the above calculation indicates that the state vector @xmath27 is nothing but the probability generating function .",
    "in fact , if we define the unnormalized spin coherent state as @xmath50 then , the coherent state representation of the state vector @xmath27 is given by @xmath51 this is the definition of the probability generating function .    here , we mention the difference between our su(2 ) method and that in the previous study . in the previous study , a non - hermitian representation of the su(2 )",
    "operators was used to realize the operator action eq .",
    "( [ eq : operation ] )  @xcite , instead of the modification of the state normalization . that is , the lowering operator is not hermite conjugate to the raising operator , @xmath52 .",
    "this non - hermiticity makes a complicated situation that the coherent state @xmath53 is not adjoint to the coherent state @xmath54 . on the other hand in our formalism",
    ", the hermiticity is retained .",
    "therefore , it is anticipated that in our formalism one can readily apply the methods developed in quantum mechanics and calculation would become concise .",
    "this is demonstrated in the following sections .",
    "let us consider the case of the binomial distribution : @xmath55 the binomial distribution is represented by the state vector @xmath56 as @xmath57 where in the last line we have set @xmath58 .",
    "that is , the binomial distribution can be represented by an unnormalized spin coherent state .",

    "in fact , since the specific number state can be represented as @xmath63 , one can express the specific number state as a derivative of the binomial state , @xmath64 therefore , the generating function @xmath65 with the initial state @xmath20 at time @xmath61 can be expressed as @xmath66      since the probability generating function is expressed as a propagator of the spin coherent state , this generating function can be expressed as a path integral form dividing the time - evolution operator ( see appendix [ sec : path integral ] ) @xmath67 \\bigr\\}.\\ ] ] @xmath68 $ ] is the action functional @xmath69 =   j \\ln ( 1+x z(t ) ) + j \\ln ( 1+\\bar{z}(0 ) y ) + \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d } t \\biggl\\ { j \\frac { \\dot{\\bar{z } } z - \\bar{z } \\dot{z } } { 1+\\bar{z } z } + h(\\bar{z } , z ) \\biggr\\},\\ ] ] where the overdot denotes time derivative and the variables @xmath70 and @xmath71 have the following boundary conditions , @xmath72 hamiltonian @xmath73 is given by a matrix element of the operator @xmath31 with respect to the unnormalized spin coherent state @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "specific matrix elements of lower powers of operators are calculated in appendix [ sec : path integral ] .",
    "in this section , we apply our formalism to the simplest stochastic system with finite - state - level .",
    "this is the linear sis epidemic model . in this model",
    ", each individual can take either susceptible state @xmath76 or infected state @xmath77 .",
    "we take the state of the system @xmath3 as the number of infected individuals .",
    "therefore , the number of susceptible individuals is @xmath78 .",
    "transition probabilities of this model is given as follows , @xmath79    that is , each susceptible individual is infected with a probability @xmath80 per unit time , and transitions to the infected state . on the other hand , an individual in the infected state recovers from the infection disease with a probability @xmath81 per unit time , and transitions to the susceptible state .",
    "immunity is not taken into account upon recover from the infection .",
    "thus , recovered individuals return immediately to the susceptible state .",
    "we allow the transition probabilities @xmath80 and @xmath81 to have arbitrary time - dependences for generality .",
    "a natural specific assignment of the recover probability may be to set @xmath82 as time - independent .",
    "the infection probability @xmath80 may have periodicity to reflect the seasonal epidemic . then",
    ", the corresponding master equation is given by @xmath83 it should be noted that this is a linear model , where the allowed infection process is @xmath84 , and the process @xmath85 have not been considered .",
    "thus , our model is different to the usual sis epidemic model  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to the master equation is given as a linear combination of the su(2 ) operators , @xmath86      here , we analyze the linear sis model by an algebraic method .",
    "a similar attempt has been already made in the previous study , however the analysis has been restricted to a specific initial state or a specific transition probability  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we make a complete analysis here .    from the algebraic property of this system , the time - evolution operator @xmath34 can be expressed as a decomposed exponential form ( see appendix [ wei - norman ] )  @xcite : @xmath87 where each function @xmath88 is respectively given by @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93      we first consider the case of the binomial initial state at initial time @xmath59 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 . by using formula of su(2 ) operators ( see appendix [ sec : operator ] ) , the probability generating function @xmath60 at time @xmath61 is calculated as follows , @xmath96   }   e^{(x + g_1 ) j_- } |0 \\rangle \\notag \\\\ = & ( 1+y)^{-n } e^{g_0}e^ { -j g_2 }    \\bigl[1 + ( x+g_1 ) ( y + g_3 ) e^{g_2 } \\bigr]^{n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the third and fourth line we have used the ordering formulae eqs .",

    "thus , when the initial distribution is given by the binomial distribution , probability distribution retains the shape of the binomial distribution , and time - dependence in the transition probabilities only affects its rate parameter to be time - dependent .",
    "this result seems plausible , reflecting the fact that the hamiltonian eq .",
