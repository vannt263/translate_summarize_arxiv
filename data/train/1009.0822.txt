    "for the same reasons , all relations involving @xmath35 are not applicable to ncyg08 - 2 .",
    "buscombe and de vaucouleurs ( 1955 ) suggested that all normal novae have the same absolute magnitude 15 days after maximum light .",

    "therefore , the total gas mass within the ionized shell is    @xmath75    this is very close to the range of ejected mass ( from 2.0 to 1.5 10@xmath76 m@xmath6 ) predicted by various authors ( politano et al . , 1995 ; starrfield et al . , 1998 ; starrfield et al . ,",
    "2008 ) for a wd mass of 1.25 m@xmath6 .",
    "hachisu and kato ( 2009 ) estimated a mass of 1.3 m@xmath6 from fitting their models to the light - curve of ncyg08 - 2 .",
    "this is in agreement with all physical models of nova explosion that predict the a mass of the white dwarf closer to the chandrasekhar limit with decreasing speed classes @xmath26 and @xmath35 ( starrfield , 1989 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the ejected shell is    @xmath77    where the velocity of the ejecta is taken to be @xmath78 which is consistent with an ejection over a short period of time around @xmath79=0 .",
    "the outburst had also to provide the energy to unbound the ejected material from the wd gravitational field .",

    "the abundance derived for iron , which is not produced by the tnr , corresponds to a metallicity for the accreted material of [ fe / h]=@xmath70.25 .",
    "the sub - solar value agrees with expected mean ambient metallicity for the galactic disk ( @xmath70.5@xmath54[fe / h]@xmath54@xmath70.3 , maciel and costa , 2010 ) at the galactocentric distance ( 13 kpc ) of ncyg08 - 2 , and well within the local dispersion around the mean value .",
    "there is a clear over - abundance of neon in the ejecta of ncyg08 - 2 .",
    "this element is not produced during the nuclear runaway , but comes from mixing into the accreted envelope of material from the underlying massive white dwarf .",
    "in massive progenitors of white dwarfs , non - degenerate carbon ignition leads to the formation of a degenerate core mainly made of oxygen and neon .",

    "the observed over - abundance of neon thus confirms the evidences for a massive white dwarf in ncyg08 - 2 as inferred by the he / n classification , the rapid decline and small amount of ejected mass .",

    "the identification and brightness of the progenitor of ncyg08 - 2 has been matter of discussion .",
    "iauc 8934 listed various sources of measurement of the nova astrometric position , which differ by several arcsec , and reported conflicting identification with different usno - b1.0 catalog stars .",

    "the values for star @xmath37 are identical to those found by jurdana - sepic and munari ( 2008 ) .",
    "this indicates that the star they assumed could be the progenitor is indeed the field star @xmath37 in figure  9 .",
    "the true progenitor was too faint to be recorded by the asiago schmidt plates ( limiting @xmath11 magnitude typically between 18.0 and 18.5 ) .",
    "the progenitor is catalogued as usno - b1.0  1223 - 0482965 and it has no 2mass counterpart .",
    "the usno - b1.0 magnitudes appear unreliable for the stars in the immediate vicinity and for the progenitor itself , most probably an effect of the crowding in the field . for ex .",
    ", contrary to evidence from direct inspection of the sdss plates and results of ccd observations , the usno - b1.0 catalogue gives the same @xmath11@xmath816.2 mag for both @xmath91 and @xmath37 stars , instead of respectively @xmath11=16.95 and @xmath11=17.86 .",
    "we have then estimated directly on palomar sdss - ii images the brightness of the nova progenitor and found : @xmath11@xmath818.3 , @xmath12@xmath817.4 , @xmath92@xmath816.9 ( uncertainties @xmath10.2 mag ) .",
    "on afosc images for 31 july 2009 the nova shined at @xmath0=17.44 , @xmath12=17.06 and @xmath13=16.73 , and @xmath0=17.88 , @xmath12=17.49 and @xmath13=17.14 on 21 july 2010 ( uncertainties @xmath10.03 mag ) .",
    "thus , at the time of the photometric and spectroscopic observations on days + 477 and + 831 the nova had returned to a brightness close to that of quiescence . finally , it has to be noted that balman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report that the progenitor was fainter than 18.2 in @xmath12 band in 2007 is equivalent to say that it was fainter than star @xmath93 in figure  10 .",
    "this was not the case at the time of the palomar sdss - ii @xmath12 image in figure  9 .",
    "the spectrum of ncyg08 - 2 on day + 477 , at a time when the nova had already returned close to quiescence brightness , is presented in figure  10 .",
    "it is characterized by a hot continuum and high excitation emission lines , with the intensity of heii 4686   slightly larger than that of h@xmath9 .",
    "two sets of lines are simultaneously present on the day + 477 spectrum : ( 1 ) nebular lines from highly diluted , distant and expanding material , and ( 2 ) permitted lines from resumed accretion .    the first type of lines is exemplified by the saddle - like profiles of [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007   lines .",
    "the insert of figure  10 illustrates the de - convolution of the [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007 blend with two individual saddle - like profiles characterized by a velocity separation of 3050 km / sec of the two peaks .",
    "a similar de - convolution with a similar velocity separation works well for the [ nii ] 6548 , 6584   blend , with in addition a single peaked h@xmath53 component superimposed . at the time of the nebular spectrum for day + 108 in figure  5 , the velocity separation of the two peaks of the saddle - like profile of [ oiii ] lines was 4000 km / sec .",
    "thus , in the intervening year , ( @xmath19 ) the expansion of the ejecta has been either slowed down or ( @xmath20 ) the emission from [ oiii ] , [ nii ] lines at day + 477 came from more internal and therefore slower layers than [ oiii ] , [ neiii ] at day + 108 in figure  7 .",
    "the first possibility requires a large deceleration of the ejecta and is not plausible .",
    "supposing that ( @xmath91 ) this occoured at a uniform rate in the time interval between day + 108 and + 477 , and that ( @xmath37 ) it involved the whole ejected shell , then the energy radiated by the associated shock front would have been @xmath81.7 10@xmath51 erg for a mean luminosity of 5.5 10@xmath94 erg / sec @xmath95 1400 l@xmath6 .",
    "considering that the temperatures associated to shock fronts bring the peak of the emitted energy into the most energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum , ncyg08 - 2 should have been a very bright and a very hard x - ray source during the time interval between day + 108 and + 477 , contrary to evidence from the swift observations by page et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that extend to day + 236 .",
    "the second possibility is instead in line with the fact that the emissivity of lines depend from electron density , which declines as @xmath65 , thus faster in the outer ejecta that expand at higher velocities .",
    "the second type of lines visible on the day + 477 spectrum of figure  10 , which are characterized by a single - peaked and sharp profile , is composed by hydrogen balmer series , hei , heii and niii .",
    "these lines and the hot underlying continuum closely resemble those of cataclysmic variables , close matches being for example the spectra of bo cet ( zwitter and munari , 1995 ) or that of the old novae rr pic ( williams and ferguson , 1983 ) and hr del ( munari et al .",
    "this close similarity with cv spectra supports the idea that accretion had already resumed at day + 477 on ncyg08 - 2 .",
    "the short time scale flickering of x - ray emission detected by page et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in ncyg08 - 2 at advanced evolutionary phase , when the hydrogen burning and super - soft phase was already over , is also supporting the fact that ncyg08 - 2 had resumed accretion at the time of our day + 477 spectroscopic observation .",
