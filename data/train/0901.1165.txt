    "the galactic radio emission is polarized ( @xcite ) , if it is not depolarized , best shown at tens of ghz ( @xcite ) .",

    "the magnetic field of our galaxy is more important in astrophysics and astroparticle physics than the fields in other galaxies .",
    "magnetic fields are certainly one of key ingredients of the interstellar medium .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields contribute to the hydrostatic balance and stability of the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) , and even disk dynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic fields in molecular clouds , which are closely related to the galactic fields ( @xcite ) , play an important role in the star formation process ( see a review by @xcite ) .",
    "more important is that the magnetic fields of our galaxy are the main agent for transport of charged cosmic - rays ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is impossible to understand the origin and propagation of cosmic rays without adequate knowledge of galactic magnetic fields . the galactic radio emission and its polarization , which result from the galactic magnetic fields , is found to heavily ( up to 95% in polarization ) `` pollute '' the measurements of the cosmological microwave background ( cmb , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "galactic magnetic fields have suddenly become very important in the cmb studies of cosmology !    to understand magnetic fields , we have first to measure them and learn their properties .",
    "the galactic scale is in the middle between the stellar scale and the cosmological scale .",
    "it is on this scale that the magnetic fields can be well _ measured _ at present , at least from our galaxy .",
    "observations of galactic - scale magnetic fields provide the most important hints for and constraints on the origin and maintenance of the magnetic fields of galactic objects and the fields in the universe . in the following",
    ", i will review the observed magnetic structures in the galactic disk , the galactic center and the galactic halo .",
    "magnetic fields pervade the diffuse interstellar medium , molecular clouds , and very dense cloud cores or hii regions . when interstellar gas contracts to form a cloud or a cloud core the field is enhanced .",
    "therefore , the observed field strength in clouds increases with gas density ( @xcite ) . here , i review the observational results of large - scale magnetic fields in the galactic disk which are related to the diffuse medium and spiral structure and have a scale greater than 1  kpc",
    ". magnetic fields on smaller scales will be mentioned only if they are related to the large - scale fields .",
    "there are five observational tracers of the galactic magnetic fields : polarization of starlight , polarized thermal dust emission from clouds , zeeman splitting of lines , diffuse synchrotron radio emission , and faraday rotation of polarized sources .",
    "* polarization of starlight *    starlight becomes polarized when it passes through the interstellar medium and is absorbed or scattered by interstellar dust grains preferentially aligned by magnetic fields .",
    "the observed polarization is the integrated effect of scattering between the star and the sun , and the `` polarization vectors '' show the averaged field orientation ( weighted by the unknown local dust content ) .",
    "starlight polarization data have been obtained for about 10,000 stars , mostly within 2 or 3  kpc of the sun ( see @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of these data show that the local field is parallel to the galactic plane and follows the local spiral arms ( @xcite ) .",
    "starlight polarization data are difficult to use for detection of galactic magnetic fields in a much larger region than 2 or 3 kpc .",
    "however , recent developments in instruments help to get a lot of new starlight polarization data for revealing magnetic fields in given objects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "* polarized thermal dust emission from clouds *    in recent years , with development of instruments and backend technology ( e.g. @xcite ) , observations of polarized thermal dust emission at mm , sub - mm and infrared bands have been used to detect the transverse orientation of magnetic fields in molecular clouds ( see review by @xcite ) on scales from 1 pc to tens of pc . the observed",
    "magnetic fields always have an hourglass shape , which indicates that the fields were enhanced when the clouds were formed by compressing the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "recently , li et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that magnetic fields in molecular clouds seem to be preferentially parallel to the galactic plane , indicating that the magnetic fields in the clouds preserve the fields frozen into the diffuse medium .    *",
    "zeeman splitting of lines *    zeeman splitting of spectral lines can measure _ in situ _ field strength of the line - of - sight component in molecular clouds or maser spots with a scale size @xmath1 au . to date , zeeman splitting of emission or absorption lines has been detected from about 20 clouds ( see a list in @xcite ) and in oh masers associated with 140 hii or star - formation regions using single dishes ( e.g. @xcite ) or interferometers ( e.g. @xcite ) . from collected zeeman splitting data of oh masers of hii regions and oh or hi absorption or emission lines of molecular clouds themselves , han & zhang ( 2007 ) found large - scale reversals in the sign of the line - of - sight component of the median field , indicating field reversals in a pattern similar to reversals revealed from pulsar rm data ( see below ) . evidently , magnetic fields on such a small scale are related to the large - scale galactic magnetic fields to a very surprising extent ( @xcite ) .",
    "interstellar magnetic fields are apparently preserved as fossil fields through the cloud formation and star formation process , and even in stars ( see g. wade s talk in this volume ) . how can such coherent magnetic field directions be preserved from the low density medium ( @xmath2 ) to higher density clouds ( @xmath3 ) , even to the highest density in maser regions ( @xmath4 ) , with compression of 3 or even 10 orders of magnitude ?",
    "it is a puzzle .",
    "the turbulent and violent processes in molecular clouds apparently can not significantly alter the mean magnetic field .    * diffuse synchrotron radio emission *    the total and polarized intensities of synchrotron emission are usually used to estimate the total and _ ordered _ field strength . for nearby galaxies ,",
    "the strength of the _ regular _ large - scale field is probably much overestimated from the polarization percentage , because the so - called _ ordered _ fields consist of the regular large - scale fields and anisotropic random fields ( @xcite ) which both produce polarized emission .",
    "we can not have a face - on view of the global magnetic field structure in our galaxy through polarized synchrotron emission , as is possible for nearby spiral galaxies ( see r. beck s talk in this volume ) .",
    "polarization surveys of the galactic plane have been comprehensively reviewed by reich ( 2007 ) .",
    "the observed polarized emission from the galactic plane is the sum of all contributions with different polarization properties ( i.e. polarization angles and polarization percentages ) coming from various regions at different distances along a line of sight .",
    "emission from more distant regions suffers from more faraday effect produced by the foreground interstellar medium .",
    "polarized emissions from different regions should `` depolarize '' each other when they are summed , which is more obvious at lower frequencies .",
    "observations at higher frequencies ( e.g. at 6  cm by @xcite ) show polarized structures at larger distances because depolarization is less severe .",
    "the polarized structures are closely related to the magnetic field structure where the emission is generated .",
    "some large - angular - scale polarized features are seen emerging from the galactic disk , for example , the north polar spur ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "* faraday rotation of pulsars and radio sources *    faraday rotation of linearly polarized radiation from pulsars and extragalactic radio sources ( egrs ) is the most powerful probe of the diffuse magnetic field in the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic fields in a large part of the galactic disk have been revealed by rm data of pulsars , which gives a measure of the line - of - sight component of the field .",
    "egrs have the advantage of large numbers but pulsars have the advantage of being spread through the galaxy at approximately known distances , allowing direct three - dimensional mapping of the magnetic fields . for a pulsar at distance @xmath5 ( in pc ) , the rm ( in radians  m@xmath6 ) is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron density in @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the vector magnetic field in @xmath0 g and @xmath11 is an elemental vector along the line of sight toward us ( positive rms correspond to fields directed toward us ) in pc . with the pulsar dispersion measure , @xmath12",
    "we obtain a direct estimate of the field strength weighted by the local free electron density @xmath13 where rm and dm are in their usual units of rad m@xmath6 and @xmath9 pc and @xmath14 is in @xmath0 g .",
    "previous analyses of pulsar rm data have often used the model - fitting method ( @xcite ) , i.e. , to model magnetic field structures in all of the paths from the pulsars to us ( observer ) and fit them , together with the electron density model , to the observed rm data . _ significant improvement _",
    "can be obtained when both rm and dm data are available for many pulsars in a given region with similar lines of sight .",
    "measuring the gradient of rm with distance or dm is the most powerful method of determining both the direction and magnitude of the large - scale field local to that particular region of the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "field strengths in the region can be _ directly derived _ from the slope of trends in plots of rm versus dm . based on eq .",
    "( [ eq - b ] ) , we get    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the mean line - of - sight field component in @xmath0 g for the region between distances @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "field structure : *    so far , rms of 1021 pulsars have been observed ( @xcite ) , if new rms of 477 pulsars by han , van straten , manchester & demorest ( 2009 , in preparation ) are included ( see fig .",
    "[ rm_psr_egr ] ) .",
    "this enables us to investigate the structure of the galactic magnetic field over a larger region than that previously possible .",
    "we have detected counterclockwise magnetic fields in the innermost arm , the norma arm ( @xcite ) .",
    "a more complete analysis for the fields of our galaxy ( @xcite and han et al . 2009 , in preparation ) from both rms of pulsars and egrs gives a picture for the coherent large - scale fields aligned with the spiral - arm structure , as shown in fig.1 : magnetic fields in all inner spiral arms are counterclockwise when viewed from the north galactic pole .",
    "on the other hand , at least in the local region and in the inner galaxy in the fourth quadrant , there is good evidence that the fields in interarm regions are similarly coherent , but reversed to be clockwise .",
    "there are at least four or five reversals in the fourth quadrant , probably occurring near the boundary of the spiral arms . in the galactic central region interior to the norma arm , new rm data of pulsars indicate that the fields are clockwise , reversed again from the counterclockwise field in the norma arm . in the first galactic quadrant , because the separations between spiral arms are so small , the rm data are dominated by counterclockwise fields in the arm regions though some ( not many ) negative pulsar rms indicate clockwise fields in the interarm regions .",
    "the magnetic field in the perseus arm can not be determined well .",
    "the averaged rm of egrs in a given sky region reflect the common foreground galactic rm contribution , which is the integration of @xmath21 from the sun to the outskirts of the galactic disk .",
    "comparison of the mean of rms of background egrs with rms of foreground pulsars can reveal the magnetic fields behind the pulsars ( see fig .",
    "[ rm_psr_egr ] ) .",

    "the fluctuations in the rm distribution of extragalactic radio sources ( @xcite ) with galactic longitude , especially these of the fourth galactic quadrant , are consistent with magnetic field directions derived from pulsar data ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "fitting various models to the new rm dataset shows different results ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most important is to have a model consistent with the detected field reversals .",
    "looking at table 2 of men et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , one can see that any single - mode model is not enough to fit rm data though the bisymmetrical spiral model with field reversals is the best and gives the smallest @xmath22 .",
    "field strength : *    with much more pulsar rm data , for the first time , han et al .",
    "( 2006 ) were able to _ measure _ the regular azimuthal field strength of near the tangential regions in the 1st and 4th galactic quadrants , and then plot the dependence of regular field strength as a function of galactocentric radius ( fig .  [ br ] ) .",
    "although the `` uncertainties '' , which in fact reflect the random fields , are large , the tendency is clear that fields get stronger at smaller galactocentric radius and weaker in interarm regions . to parameterize the radial variation , an exponential function was chosen to give the smallest @xmath22 value and to avoid a singularity at @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) and unphysical values at large r ( for the linear gradient ) .",

    "magnetic fields on such small scales should follow the same power - law , since magnetic fields are frozen into the ionized interstellar medium .",
    "minter & spangler ( 1996 ) found that structure functions of rotation measure and emission measure were consistent with a 3d - turbulence kolmogorov spectrum of magnetic fields up to 4  pc , but with a 2d turbulence between 4  pc and 80 pc .",

    "the poloidal fields are possibly limited to a smaller central region .",
    "the newly discovered `` double helix '' nebula ( @xcite ) , with an estimated field strength of order 100  @xmath0 g , reinforces the presence of strong poloidal magnetic fields in tube format merging from the rotating circumnuclear gas disk near the galactic center .",
    "polarized thermal dust emission has been detected in the molecular cloud zone at sub - mm wavelength ( see fig .",
    "[ gc ] , @xcite ) , which is probably related to the toroidal fields parallel to the galactic plane and complements the poloidal fields shown by the vertical filaments .",

    "evidence for spiral arms is so strong , therefore it is a correct idea to incorporate the spiral structure into any electron density model .",
    "now , the spiral arms in the fourth galactic quadrant have been better determined , while in the first quadrant , it is much less clear . also , the electron density within a few kpc from the galactic center is not clear at all . the electron density model and hence the pulsar distances therefore have a large uncertainty in these regions .",
