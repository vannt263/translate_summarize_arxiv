    "the spin ices  @xcite , such as ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite , dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite and ho@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite are frustrated ising magnets .",
    "the rare earth atoms are located on a pyrochlore lattice , a face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice with tetrahedral basis , creating a network of corner - linked tetrahedra ( see fig .  [ q0tet ] ) . in these systems",
    "the crystal field creates a very strong anisotropy estimated at @xmath6 k  @xcite which constrains the spins to the local trigonal axes ( members of the @xmath7 direction set ) .",
    "the spins are therefore ising - like but non - collinear : they point either into or out of the elementary tetrahedra of the pyrochlore structure  @xcite .",
    "the dominant interaction is the dipolar interaction which favors a local arrangement of spins on a tetrahedron in which two spins point in and two spins point out  @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the bernal - fowler `` ice rule '' for proton location in ice and means that the spin ice has the same configurational entropy as ice  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy is so strong that the fully saturated ferromagnetic state can be reached only in principal , using magnetic fields well outside the range of conventional measurements  @xcite .",
    "most of the interesting physics happens in much lower fields , where the zeeman energy , which competes with relatively weak exchange and dipolar interactions , is dominated by the @xmath7 anisotropy .",
    "for instance , in polycrystalline dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , about half of the zero - point entropy missing in zero field , @xmath8 , is recovered already in a field of 0.5 t  @xcite .    in general the spin ices have strongly anisotropic bulk properties  @xcite .",
    "this is unusual for cubic systems but can be understood as another manifestation of the strongly anisotropic nature of the individual rare earth moments .",
    "the application of magnetic fields at low temperature can be used to systematically investigate the removal of the degeneracy of the spin ice state . as a result of the anisotropy",
    ", different degeneracy removal schemes are expected depending on the direction in which the field is applied  @xcite .",
    "several scenarios have been investigated by experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite methods but there have so far been only a few neutron scattering investigations  @xcite .    the basic behavior of the system can be understood in terms of the near neighbor spin ice model , which considers near neighbor ferromagnetic coupling between the spins  @xcite .",
    "application of the field along the @xmath2 $ ] direction is expected to completely remove the degeneracy that exists in zero field  @xcite .",
    "all the spins on a tetrahedron have the same relation to the applied field , making an angle of 54@xmath9  to it ( see fig .",
    "[ q0tet ] ) .",
    "fields up to 2 t along @xmath2 $ ] are insufficient to overcome the anisotropy and fully align the spins .",
    "however , the field does stabilize a ground state in which the same member of the set of six `` two - spins - in - two - spins - out '' local groundstates is selected on every tetrahedron .",
    "experimentally  @xcite this is manifested , at 1.6 k , by a simple magnetization curve and a saturation magnetization of @xmath10 atom@xmath11 .",
    "the saturation magnetization is reduced from @xmath12 atom@xmath11 , as expected for the non - collinear structure .",
    "the near neighbor spin ice model predicts a particularly interesting phase transition when the field is applied along @xmath2 $ ]  @xcite . in zero field",
    "the model system shows no ordering transition and the heat capacity consists of a single schottky anomaly due to isolated spin flips . in small fields",
    "a very sharp peak occurs below the schottky anomaly , indicative of a first order phase transition .",
    "the field - temperature phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ lgcpfig ] , has a line of symmetry - sustaining first order phase transitions , terminated by a critical end point .",
    "this is analogous to the density variation seen in a pressure - temperature phase diagram of a liquid - gas system .",
    "the `` liquid '' and `` gas''phases of the magnetic system are distinguished thermodynamically by their degree of magnetization , that plays a role analogous to the fluid density .",
    "a triple point occurs at @xmath13 .",
    "one aim of the work described in this paper is to search for the critical point in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this is described in section  [ ho001ressec ] .    when the field is applied along @xmath3",
    "$ ] two spins per tetrahedron have a component in the field direction , while two are precisely perpendicular to the field ( see fig . [ q0tet ] ) .",
    "of the two which have a component along the field , one is pinned pointing `` in '' and one pointing `` out '' of the tetrahedron .",
    "the perpendicular spins are not pinned by the field . however , in the applied field , the ground state of the tetrahedron can still be described by the `` ice rule '' .",
    "therefore the unpinned spins also form an in / out pair ( see fig .",
    "[ q0tet ] )  @xcite .",
    "the two groups form in - out spin chains , running either parallel or perpendicular to the field .",
    "each chain has a magnetic moment in the sense of the chain , but in the near neighbor model there is no coupling between the perpendicular chains .",

    "it was shown that the application of the field along @xmath14 $ ] restores order , with two coexisting magnetic structures , denoted @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig .  [ q0tet ] ) .",
    "the structures are named because @xmath15 gives rise only to magnetic bragg scattering at zone centers , or @xmath15 positions , whereas @xmath16 gives rise to bragg scattering at both the zone centers and the @xmath17 points on the zone boundaries ( see fig .",

    "it was found that the @xmath15 structure was formed at 0.3 k when a field was applied and the @xmath16 structure appeared as a high temperature ( @xmath20 k ) modification .",
    "the ho@xmath21 moment is severely reduced in the @xmath19 phase  @xcite .",
    "one of the results of the current work is to show that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 structures are in fact associated with different sets of spins : the @xmath4 and @xmath5 chains respectively and that the formation of @xmath16 correlations is controlled by the very slow dynamics in the @xmath22 k regime ( see sections  [ dy110ressec ] and  [ ho110ressec ] ) .",
    "in addition to making the first determination of the residual entropy in a spin ice  @xcite , ramirez and co - workers measured the heat capacity of a dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 powder in fields up to 6 t. three small , sharp , field independent peaks were observed in finite fields .",
    "these peaks at @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 k were attributed to the ordering of spins not pinned by the field .",
    "more recently , single crystal samples of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 have been studied by bulk methods in fields applied along @xmath26 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results of ref .   suggest the formation of the @xmath5 chains , but do not infer any correlation between the chains .",
    "it was concluded that the @xmath5 chains behave as one dimensional ising ferromagnets .",
    "most recently , simulations of the dipolar spin ice model ( that goes beyond the near neighbor model by considering further range dipolar couplings ) have predicted that in strong fields there are two transitions  @xcite . at high temperature",
    "the field induces order in the @xmath4 chains and at a lower temperature the @xmath5 chains undergo a phase transition into the @xmath19 phase .",
    "dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 has been studied less by neutron scattering due to the significant absorption problem .",
    "however , it has been shown that at high temperatures ( @xmath27 k ) dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is paramagnetic with fluctuations dominated by single ion effects  @xcite .",
    "a preliminary report of some of the results detailed below has also been made  @xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the spin ice materials ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 only differ in detail ; a comparison of the two should identify generic behavior and reveal the importance of minor terms in the spin hamiltonian . in this work ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "have been studied by single crystal neutron scattering with an external magnetic field applied along the @xmath2 $ ] or @xmath3 $ ] axis .",
    "these measurements are the first detailed microscopic investigation of the field dependent properties of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 at low temperature , and an extension of the investigation already performed on ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . following an experimental section ( [ expsec ] ) ,",
    "results are given for application of the field along @xmath2 $ ] in section  [ ressec001 ] and discussed in section  [ dissec001 ] .",
    "then the results for the @xmath3 $ ] orientation are given and discussed in sections  [ ressec110 ] and  [ dissec110 ] .",
    "as yet there is no detailed theory with which to analyze these results , so we restrict ourselves to largely qualitative discussion and conclusions ( section  [ consec ] ) .",
    "the experiments on ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 were conducted on different instruments at two neutron sources : ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 on d10 at the ill reactor source , and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 on prisma at the isis spallation source .",
    "all the measurements reported in this article used a single crystal aligned with either the @xmath2 $ ] or @xmath3 $ ] axis parallel to the applied field ( vertical )",
    ". this allowed us to access the scattering plane with wavevectors of the type @xmath28 or @xmath29 respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ zonesdetectors ] for an illustration of these planes ) .",
    "two experiments were carried out on the prisma spectrometer at isis under the same conditions . to minimize neutron absorption , the isotopically enriched single crystal of @xmath30dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , described in detail in ref .  , was used .",
    "the crystal was varnished into a large copper support to ensure good thermal contact and mounted on a dilution refrigerator insert in a 7 t cryomagnet .",
    "the 16 detectors of prisma make radial trajectories across the scattering plane  @xcite . in order to map the scattering plane ,",
    "the crystal is rotated about the vertical axis and scattering from adjacent sectors of the scattering plane is collected in successive settings . to cover a small area of the scattering plane",
    "two different types of scan can be used .",
    "either a single setting of the crystal providing relatively coarse coverage of reciprocal space , or for better resolution a rocking scan . in this case the 16 detector trajectories of successive points in the rocking scan are interleaved , considerably improving the definition of features in reciprocal space .",
    "the scattering planes and detector trajectories used in this study are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ zonesdetectors ] .    where non - resolution limited features were observed they were used to extract correlation lengths .",
    "the resolution function as a function of time of flight ( parallel to the detector trajectory ) is a bilateral exponential function describing the pulse shape from the moderator  @xcite .",
    "perpendicular to the detector trajectory the resolution function is gaussian .",
    "the resolution functions were parameterized and interpolated by fitting to bragg peaks in the high field data and convolved with a lorentizian to fit the experimental data .",
    "ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 was measured on the single crystal diffractometer d10 at the ill .",
    "two single crystals grown from a flux of lead fluoride were used  @xcite , one for each field direction . for the @xmath2 $ ] orientation",
    "the crystal was @xmath31 mm and for the @xmath3 $ ] orientation the crystal was @xmath32 mm .",
    "they were of identical quality if the widths of bragg peaks were compared . to simplify corrections for effects such as demagnetization and extinction , the crystals were sphericalized  @xcite .",
    "appropriately aligned crystals were fixed to oxygen free copper pins using stycast resin and attached to a dilution refrigerator insert in a 2.5 t vertical field cryomagnet , mounted on d10 using a tilt stage .",
    "d10 was configured with a graphite monochromator and a small area detector .",
    "the wavelength was @xmath33    and a pyrolitic graphite filter in the incident beam was used to suppress any @xmath34 contamination .",
    "@xmath35-scans ( in which the crystal is rotated about the vertical axis ) were measured at all positions .",
    "the integrated intensities of nuclear and magnetic bragg peaks were extracted in the usual manner  @xcite . however , the diffuse scattering was often too broad for the @xmath35-scan performed .",
    "this resulted in the appearance of a flat intensity profile , albeit elevated from the expected background , whose intensity and width were subsequently strongly field or temperature dependent .",
    "it was therefore attributed to a magnetic scattering feature broader than the width of the scan .",
    "it proved impractical to extract widths from these features so the peak intensity was obtained to give a measure of @xmath36 , the wavevector dependent susceptibility , throughout the experiment .",
    "the amplitude was extracted by fitting to a functional form appropriate to the peak shape : straight lines , single gaussians , or triangular functions .",
    "the bragg scattering data was treated by refining model magnetic structures using the ccsl  @xcite program maglsq . during the data analysis it became apparent that there was a significant extinction problem . in a subsequent experiment",
    "the larger crystal was measured at room temperature using four circle geometry and two wavelengths ( @xmath37 and @xmath38  , copper and graphite monochromators respectively ) .",
    "this data was used for the refinement of extinction parameters using the becker and coppens model as implemented in the ccsl program sflsq  @xcite .",
    "thermal parameters derived from a rietveld refinement against powder diffraction data were used to avoid correlation between the extinction and thermal parameters  @xcite .",
    "the powder data was recorded at 1.8 k on the polaris medium resolution diffractometer at isis .",
    "the difference in temperature of the single crystal and powder data sets was assumed to be absorbed by the extinction parameters as the final fit was good ( @xmath39  @xcite ) .",
    "the extinction parameters allow the reproduction of nuclear intensities so that the magnetic structure can be fitted by adjusting only the size of the magnetic moment .",
    "the quality of the fit of the magnetic structures decreases as the field increases ( in fig .",
    "[ d10hk0loops ] it can be seen that as the field increases , the uncertainty of the fitted moment becomes much greater ) .",
    "this is attributed to a field dependent extinction effect .",
    "it is possible for nuclear and magnetic scattering to be affected differently by extinction  @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic structures in this work are field dependent , it is likely that the extinction is also field dependent . as the field and magnetic intensity increases , the extinction correction becomes less and less applicable .",
    "it proved impossible to overcome the problem with the available data .",
    "the sample was cooled to 0.05 k and the @xmath28 scattering plane was mapped .",
    "then the first quadrant of a hysteresis loop was measured ( up to 2 t ) , during which the scattering plane was mapped at 1 and 2 t. at intermediate fields , a single setting was measured giving access to a small area of reciprocal space surrounding the @xmath40 axis out to the @xmath41 reflection . after returning to zero field the crystal was rotated to access the @xmath42 peak and its field dependence was measured .",
    "[ twomaps ] compares the scattering in 0 and 1 t from the @xmath28 plane .",
    "the diffuse scattering entirely disappears and is replaced by magnetic bragg scattering at @xmath15 positions consistent with the formation of the expected canted ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this is direct confirmation of the complete removal of degeneracy and field induced ordering .",
    "the formation of the ordered phase is also notable .",
    "[ twoloops ] shows the integrated intensity of two purely magnetic bragg peaks .",
    "this magnetic intensity grows in a series of steps .",
    "successive measurements produce similar , but not identical , order parameter curves indicating a strong history dependence .      in an attempt to find the anticipated liquid - gas critical point  @xcite a detailed survey of @xmath43-space",
    "was performed .",
    "field cycles up to 2.5 t were performed at 0.05 , 0.15 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 1.2 k. each was separated by warming to 1.2 k and cooling in zero field . for this study four",
    "reciprocal lattice positions were measured , two @xmath15 positions ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) and two @xmath16 positions ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .    while cycling the field , magnetic scattering was found to develop only on the @xmath15 bragg positions .",
    "the loops at all temperatures are consistent with the development and saturation of the @xmath15 structure ( fig .  [ d10hk0loops ] ) . in all cases @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the value of the ordered moment obtained ( @xmath49 atom@xmath11 ) agrees well with that expected for ho@xmath21 ( @xmath12 atom@xmath11 ) .",
    "again it is clear that the degeneracy is completely removed by the application of the field in this direction .",
    "increasing hysteresis and persistence of metastable states was observed as the temperature was decreased below 0.5 k. at 0.05 k a remnant magnetization is frozen into the sample on return to zero field .",
    "although no bragg scattering was observed at the @xmath16 positions , strong diffuse scattering associated with the spin ice state  @xcite was observed in zero field .",
    "the intensity of this scattering during the field cycle at 0.05 k is compared to that of the @xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ hk0bgs ] .",
    "the diffuse scattering persists in finite field and shows a step - like decrease commensurate with the step - like increase in the @xmath44 scattering .",
    "this indicates that disordered regions persist in the sample in finite field .",
    "the diffuse scattering disappears as the bragg scattering saturates in the fully ordered state .",
    "this relationship between @xmath15 bragg and @xmath16 diffuse scattering is true at all temperatures measured , but at elevated temperatures ( @xmath50 k ) there is no hysteresis .    after the hysteresis loop at 0.05",
    "k was completed , the temperature was raised in zero field . as discussed above and shown in fig .",
    "[ d10hk0loops ] , there is a remnant magnetization at the point where the hysteresis loop returns to zero field . by comparing the bragg and diffuse scattering intensities during the temperature rise",
    ", it can be seen that the frozen long range order created by applying high fields at low temperatures decays and the short range ordered spin ice state is re - established as the system is warmed up ( see fig .",
    "[ hk0bgs ] ) .",
    "this occurs at @xmath51 k.",
    "both materials show similar behavior : they are driven into the @xmath15 structure by the application of the field and are strongly hysteretic / history dependent at very low temperature .    when measuring ho@xmath0gasbo@xmath1 , blte _ et al .",
    "_ noted that below @xmath52 k it appeared that the spin system was apparently no longer in good thermal contact with the thermometer  @xcite .",
    "similar effects were observed by orendac in more recent heat capacity measurements on ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , below a temperature of @xmath53 k the heat capacity became time dependent  @xcite .",
    "the neutron scattering data is comparable with this as the hysteresis develops in field scans at @xmath54 k and below ( see fig .  [ d10hk0loops ] ) .",
    "the spin dynamics of ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 are slow in this temperature range : no dynamics have been detected by inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite and matsuhira _ et al . _ found that the susceptibility of ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 was virtually zero below @xmath54 k  @xcite .",
    "however , neutron spin echo  @xcite and muon spin relaxation  @xcite measurements have observed some residual spin dynamics at these low temperatures .",
    "the same is also true of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite . below @xmath55 k",
    "there must be a cross over from a regime in which the spin interactions maintain the system in a spin ice state but there are sufficient dynamics to allow relaxation , to one which is completely frozen .",
    "this was clearly demonstrated in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 by the decay of the remnant magnetization into the disordered spin ice state as the sample was heated above @xmath54 k ( see fig .  [ hk0bgs ] ) .",
    "the presence of magnetization plateaux in the hysteresis loops at 0.05 k is particularly interesting .",
    "the temperature ( in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ) and history ( in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ) dependence of the hysteresis suggests that these are due to very slow dynamics .",
    "the system is almost completely frozen and must be driven into the ordered state by the field .",
    "an alternative way of looking at this is to ask why a plateau occurs at a particular value of the magnetization ?",
    "for example in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 it is at @xmath56  @xmath57 atom@xmath11 .",
    "we propose that because the dynamics are so slow and the thermal fluctuations so weak , that the system is barely able to relax .",
    "therefore , the plateau does not represent a partially ordered structure with a magnetization of @xmath58 , or fluctuating moments contributing an average of @xmath58 of the saturated magnetization .",
    "instead , it represents a partially ordered spin ice , in which @xmath58 of the moments have been driven into their ordered orientation by the field and pinned .",
    "the remaining @xmath59 require higher fields to reorient them .    to extend this conjecture",
    "we suggest that there must be loops , chains and clusters of spins that can be oriented relatively easily",
    ". meanwhile some spins are left on branches , or in regions not reached by a percolating cluster . in the absence of thermal fluctuations these spins become trapped as defects in the @xmath15 state and only high fields can remove them .",
    "this is similar to work hardening in alloys .",
    "when alloys are first worked , defects can move to release the stress . as the working continues , remaining defects become entangled or locked together .",
    "eventually the material no longer responds to the stress and it fails .",
    "the neutron scattering results from ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 support this hypothesis .",
    "the system begins in a disordered spin ice state , with diffuse scattering and no bragg peaks . applying an external field results in magnetic bragg scattering from an ordered structure .",
    "simultaneously the diffuse scattering from short range correlations decreases .",
    "however , in the intermediate plateau region both bragg and diffuse scattering are present , indicating that the system has regions of both long and short range order .",
    "the postulated liquid - gas critical point was not irrefutably absent .",
    "the prediction of harris _ et al .",
    "_ can be cast as a first order phase transition in finite field  @xcite . in both materials",
    "this is observed at 0.05 k , but it is absent above @xmath60 k in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the critical point must lie in this temperature range , if it does exist .",
    "using the effective nearest neighbor coupling strength ( @xmath61 k  @xcite ) and expected rare earth moment sizes ( @xmath62 @xmath63 atom@xmath11 ) the critical point is expected at @xmath64 k and @xmath65 t for ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the development of the hysteresis in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 occurs in the right temperature and field regime but does not agree in detail with these predictions .",
    "the liquid - gas critical point is a property of a thoroughly equilibrated simulated system : it may very well be obscured in the real materials by the lack of dynamics in the temperature range of interest .",
    "also , the behavior of the dipolar spin ice model in applied field is largely unknown , it is possible that the critical point may appear elsewhere in @xmath66 space for this model .",
    "because two experiments were performed and the path through @xmath66 space became quite complex , we discuss the experiments in terms of similar field / temperature sections . for data points between the large @xmath29 maps ,",
    "rocking curves were measured about the @xmath67 axis out to ( 0,0,10 ) .      during",
    "the two experiments two hysteresis loops were measured at both 0.05 ( one in each experiment ) and 0.3 k ( both in the second experiment ) , and one at 1.9 k ( second experiment ) .",
    "information about the development of spin correlations can be extracted from the behavior of both bragg and diffuse scattering . in zero field at @xmath68 and @xmath69 k",
    "there is diffuse magnetic scattering typical of the spin ice ground state  @xcite .",
    "on applying a magnetic field this diffuse scattering disappears and is replaced by diffuse scattering of a new form centered around antiferromagnetic @xmath19 positions such as @xmath70 .",
    "concomitantly , magnetic bragg scattering appears at @xmath71 positions like @xmath72 ( see fig .",

    "will forthwith be referred to as a @xmath16 _ feature_. the @xmath16 features are relatively narrow parallel to the @xmath73 direction , but remain quite wide along @xmath67 . the distinctive distribution of scattering in the @xmath16 features is clearly seen in the mapping of the scattering plane in 1.5 t during the first hysteresis loop at 0.05 k ( see fig .  [ tigermaps ] ) . even in a field of 1.5 t",
    "the @xmath16 features are not resolution limited .    at 0.3",
    "k the disappearance of the spin ice diffuse scattering and development of the @xmath16 features is similar to that described for 0.05 k. the form of the hysteresis loops differ in detail , but both bragg scattering and @xmath16 features were observed . at 1.9 k only bragg scattering was observed , the @xmath16 features did not appear .",
    "structure factor calculations show that the @xmath15 bragg scattering is due to the @xmath4 chains and the @xmath16 features are due to the @xmath5 chains ( see section  i for definition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 chains ) .",
    "the shape of the @xmath16 features gives considerable information about the spin correlations induced in the @xmath5 chains by the application of the field .",
    "the position of the features ( i.e. at @xmath19 ) and the fact that they are discrete in reciprocal space shows that there must be antiferromagnetic correlations between @xmath5 chains .",
    "the anisotropic shape of the features shows that the order is longer ranged parallel to @xmath73 ( intrachain correlation length ) than parallel to @xmath67 ( interchain correlation length ) .",
    "a single correlated region is therefore a collection of a few chains ( with an interchain correlation length @xmath74    this is 1.13 unit cells ( in the @xmath75 direction ) and so 4 - 5 chains ) , each extending @xmath76    ( intrachain correlation length ) and ordered antiparallel .",
    "the actual correlation lengths measured depend on the history of the sample ( these were obtained at 0.05 k and 1.5 t ) , but in the most correlated states observed they are always of this order .",
    "we do not know what happens out of the scattering plane : the @xmath16 features could be rods or ellipsoidal features intersecting the scattering plane .",
    "rods would indicate a two - dimensional ordering of @xmath5 chains in planes parallel to the scattering plane .",
    "three dimensional ellipsoids would indicate three dimensional domains . on the balance of evidence it seems likely that the interchain correlations are three dimensional as opposed to two dimensional .",
    "comparison of the development of the bragg scattering during hysteresis loops measured at the same temperature reveals that the form of the curve depends on the field increments , or ramp rate , used to measure the loop . at both @xmath68 and @xmath69  k",

    "subsequent investigations , using finer field increments generally reduced the number of steps in the loop but those that remained were more clearly resolved . also , with fine field increments , there is a clear difference between 0.05 and 0.3 k. with fine field increments at 0.3 k the steps disappeared and a very smooth increase in intensity was observed . at 1.9 k",
    "no hysteresis was observed .",
    "again it appears that there is a change in dynamical regime at low temperature as shown by the presence / absence of steps at 0.05/0.3 k. the temperature of the change is lower in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 than ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a similar effect was observed at 0.5 k in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and discussed in sections  [ ho001ressec ] and  [ dissec001 ] ) because the coupling strengths are somewhat lower in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "as with the field applied along @xmath2 $ ] the very slow dynamics of spin ice materials in this low temperature regime are manifested in these observations .",
    "the identical saturation intensity of the @xmath15 bragg peaks shows that the same long range ordered state in the @xmath4 chains was realized in the hysteresis loops at 0.05 , 0.3 and 1.9 k. unlike the bragg peaks , the maximum intensity observed in the @xmath16 features was temperature dependent . comparing hysteresis loops within the second experiment shows that the @xmath19 features become more intense at 0.3 k than at 0.05 k ( see fig .  [ dyamps ] ) . at 1.9",
    "k the @xmath16 features do not form .",
    "this shows that for @xmath77 ( 1.1 k for dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ) the formation of the @xmath4 chains does not require the formation of the @xmath5 chains .",
    "however , for @xmath78 the @xmath5 chains form and the degree of correlation between them depends on the dynamics .      at 1.5  t , after the first field cycle , the temperature was raised to @xmath79 1  k. in this temperature range , the @xmath15 bragg peaks were found to be temperature independent .",
    "however the intensity of the @xmath16 features passes through a maximum at 0.7 k. another temperature scan was performed after the second hysteresis loop at 0.05 k. this was done in 0.4 t , to begin in the partially ordered plateau phase .",
    "a more pronounced maximum in the intensity of the @xmath16 features was observed at 0.6 k , above which both @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering decreased .    in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 1.5",
    "t is sufficient to maintain the @xmath4 chains in a fully polarized state , with no thermal randomization .",
    "the correlations in the @xmath5 chains increase , but begin to decrease above a temperature of @xmath80 k. the maximum temperature was not sufficiently high to leave the spin ice regime of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and see complete collapse of these features .",
    "the second temperature scan in 0.4 t began in one of the magnetization step phases . here",
    "we see that the rising temperature activated the development of further correlations in the @xmath5 chains , before thermal disorder began to reduce the correlations of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 chains .",
    "the sample was cooled to @xmath68 k in zero field and a full , 5 quadrant , hysteresis loop was measured ( up to 2.5 , down to -2.5 , then back up to 2.5 t ) .",
    "the temperature was then raised to @xmath81 k and then cooled to 0.05 k whilst maintaining a field of 2.5 t. at each field / temperature point at least five reflections were measured using @xmath35-scans , these being @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath72 . in order to determine magnetic structures , at certain field - temperature points an expanded collection of peaks",
    "was measured .",
    "where magnetic structures were refined , crystal structure and extinction parameters were assumed to be the same as those determined for the other crystal used with the field applied along @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this assumption resulted in a relatively poor refinement of magnetic structure in this experiment .",
    "we will therefore discuss most of the results in this section in terms of integrated intensities rather than sublattice magnetization .",
    "the entire hysteresis loop is shown for the @xmath72 peak in fig .",
    "[ bgloops ] . the scattering at the @xmath16 positions @xmath82 and @xmath83 is diffuse .",
    "during the hysteresis loop these features never evolved into a peak - shape within the bounds of the @xmath35-scan .",
    "the intensity at the @xmath83 position is also shown in fig .  [ bgloops ] .",
    "the @xmath72 bragg intensity saturates identically on both sides of the loop .",
    "this implies that the same long range ordered state is reached in high field , regardless of history and coexisting short range correlations . after ramping the field and driving the @xmath4 spins out of the disordered spin ice state for the first time ( pristine curve ) subsequent field sweeps are essentially all the same .",
    "the pristine curve lies outside the subsequent field cycles , indicating that the spin ice state is harder to magnetize than the subsequent state composed of @xmath4 chains .    when the @xmath15 bragg peaks appear , so do the @xmath16 features .",
    "although the detailed shape of the peak is not accessible in a single @xmath35-scan , some further details about their form were established .",
    "it is possible that the features could be part of extended sheets of scattering . with",
    "the field applied along @xmath86 $ ] the @xmath5 chains are formed along @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "a sheet of scattering might be expected to extend along @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath35-scans at an @xmath87 position should scan across this sheet .",
    "our collection of peaks allows us to check this possibility .",
    "firstly , the fact that the @xmath83 feature is flat , or outside the width of the @xmath35-scan , means that any such sheet is also rather broad perpendicular to @xmath67 .",
    "it would be expected as a flat background contribution at @xmath72 as well .",
    "the form factor of ho@xmath21 will reduce the intensity , but both positions are quite close to the maximum in the form factor , so the intensity maximum for @xmath83 in the hysteresis loop ( 600 counts ) should also be clearly visible at @xmath72 . likewise",
    "the presence of @xmath82 as a flat feature would imply another sheet extending along @xmath88 which would be visible in the background of @xmath84 .",
    "however , the backgrounds of both bragg peaks are field - independent .",
    "this rules out the possibility of extended sheets of scattering parallel to either @xmath67 or @xmath73 and suggests that the @xmath16 features are localized , as in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath16 features throughout the hysteresis loop is very interesting ( see fig .",
    "[ bgloops ] ) . in general",
    "the intensity increases from the beginning to the end of the field cycling ( the full 5 quadrants ) .",
    "however , it does so in a discontinuous , ratchet - like manner . when the intensity of the @xmath15 peaks is saturated , there is no change of intensity at the @xmath16 positions .",
    "only when the hysteresis loop passes through a region where there are field induced changes in the @xmath15 intensity do changes occur in the @xmath16 features .    despite the @xmath5 chains being decoupled from the field ,",
    "it is clear that at this temperature the field regulates the dynamics of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 chains . as discussed in section  [ dissec001 ] , it seems certain that a spin ice is frozen as regards spin flips in zero field : any significant spin flip dynamics must therefore be produced by the action of the field . during the hysteresis loop",
    "it can be seen that not only does the field reorient the @xmath4 chains , but in doing so propagates dynamics into the @xmath5 chains . during these parts of the hysteresis loop",
    "the degree of correlation increases in the @xmath5 chains . when the @xmath15 structure does not change , neither does the @xmath16 .",
    "two possible magnetic structures , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 were discussed in the earlier work of harris _ et al . _",
    "these structures were assumed to involve all four spins of the tetrahedral basis , which in light of these new results , is clearly not appropriate .",
    "we therefore used a magnetic structure with zero moments on the @xmath5 chains and ferromagnetic @xmath4 chains to fit the magnetic bragg peaks ( ignoring the diffuse scattering ) .",
    "the fitted moment ( @xmath89 atom@xmath11 ) was less than the expected 10.0 @xmath63 atom@xmath11 for ho@xmath21 , consistent with the findings of harris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who refined the moment on all four spins , assuming a fully ordered spin system .",
    "we believe the observed reduced moment is an artifact of a poor correction for extinction .",
    "after the hysteresis cycle returned to 2.5 t the system was warmed to 1.2  k and then cooled back to 0.05 k in a field of 2.5 t. an enormous gain in intensity is seen at the @xmath16 positions , in particular @xmath83 , above 0.3  k. the broad feature outside the width of the @xmath35-scan at low temperature , develops into a quite sharp peak .",
    "the correlations between the @xmath5 chains are definitely three dimensional at this stage",
    ". however , these features are not resolution limited and do not have the form of a bragg peak in the detector volume .",
    "the temperature dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ bgtscan ] .",
    "there is a tiny increase in the @xmath15 bragg peak intensity during the temperature cycle .",
    "clearly the rising temperature activates the dynamics of the @xmath5 chains and because @xmath90 the restoration of dynamics increases correlations rather than destroying them . during the temperature rise @xmath91 begins to fall again above @xmath92 k. this is roughly consistent with the peak in the susceptibility seen at around 1 k  @xcite .",
    "lowering the temperature again then freezes these correlations .",
    "activating the dynamics of the @xmath5 chains also allows a further annealing of the @xmath4 chains causing the slight increase in bragg intensity .",
    "the field - dependent properties of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 with field applied along @xmath3 $ ] show many generic features . in this section",
    "we discuss these and the conclusions which can generally be drawn for spin ice materials with a field along @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "the spin system is separated into two sub - systems , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 chains .",
    "this is inferred from the coexistence of long and short range order , the field induced short range order , and the contrasting temperature behavior of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering . when the field pins the @xmath4 spins into a long range ordered structure , the manifold of degenerate states is restricted considerably and so this also causes the @xmath5 spins to become more correlated .",
    "the correlations in the @xmath5 chains cause the scattering at the @xmath19 positions .",
    "although the evolution of the ordered @xmath15 phase is not identical in all hysteresis loops the @xmath4 chains always reach the same fully polarized state , independent of the state of the @xmath5 chains .    in both dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and",
    "ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 the scattering at the @xmath16 positions appears immediately , on application of a field , as a localized feature which then sharpens .",
    "this means that the interchain correlations begin to form as soon as the chains appear .",
    "this observation may be compared to those of hiroi _ et al . _ who made a calorimetric study of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 in a field applied along @xmath26 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of these results they argued that the @xmath5 chains behaved effectively as an assembly of one dimensional ferromagnetic ising chains embedded in a three dimensional crystal .",
    "we have directly measured the intrachain correlation length : at 1.5 t and 0.05 k it is of order @xmath93     for dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the very long but finite intrachain correlation length is indeed a characteristic property of the one dimensional ising ferromagnet . our results clearly show that there are also correlations between the chains . at 1.5 t and 0.05 k",
    "the interchain correlation length is of order @xmath94    for dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the actual value of the correlation length depends on the history of the sample .",
    "the quoted values were at 0.05 k , longer correlation lengths are observed in the hysteresis loops at 0.3 k.    hiroi _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that these chains are arranged in a triangular array , which frustrates the coupling between them , preventing the development of true long range order .",
    "the triangular arrangement is not perfectly equilateral , so that in theory a transition to @xmath16 order is observed in the @xmath5 chains .",
    "our results also show clearly that the spin system does not achieve the long range order predicted at this point in @xmath66 space  @xcite .",
    "indirectly these experiments have probed the dynamical processes operating in the spin ice materials in this very low temperature regime .",
    "the unusual situation of having the @xmath5 chains perpendicular to the field and yet coupled to it by their interaction with the @xmath4 chains gives particular insight into the dynamical regimes .",
    "these measurements show that there are dynamical processes in these materials at this extremely low temperature which have not yet been explained or detected in microscopic detail .",
    "the dynamics are extremely slow as these experiments operate at the longest timescales and yet equilibrium is not maintained . because we are below @xmath95 the density of single spin flips must be exponentially small so they must be correlated dynamical processes .    at 0.05",
    "k both materials appear to be frozen : the correlations in the @xmath5 chains only evolve when dynamics are restored by the field , via the @xmath4 chains . as the temperature",
    "is raised dynamics are increased .",
    "the boundary of the fully frozen regime was not clearly established . in all the experiments the histories followed placed the magnet in a strong field at very low temperature , with relatively disordered @xmath5 chains ( i.e. there was considerable potential for further order to develop in the @xmath5 chains , as occurred subsequently ) . in both materials",
    "this lead to the observation that the @xmath5 chains can be freed from the @xmath4 chains and exhibit their own independent behavior .",
    "this was most clearly shown in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 where the rising temperature lead to a startling increase in sharpness and intensity of the @xmath16 features .",
    "similar observations were made in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 where the degree of correlation achieved in the @xmath5 chains was greater in a hysteresis loop at 0.3 k than at 0.05 k. as far as they are known , the measured dynamics of spin ices are consistent with this  @xcite .",
    "dynamical processes appear to persist to lower temperatures in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 which is consistent with susceptibility measurements .    during all the experiments the spin ices appear to seek a long range ordered groundstate , but",
    "never realize one .",
    "this is shown by the ever increasing degree of correlation in the @xmath5 chains when dynamics are restored and the @xmath4 chains are controlled by the field .",
    "the increasing correlations are characteristic of the formation of the @xmath16 structure .",
    "the transverse ordering must be controlled by long range interactions , as the chains are not coupled by nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "it remains unclear whether the equilibrium state is the fully ordered @xmath16 structure predicted by yoshida  @xcite rather than the extended - range correlated state actually observed .",
    "the work of harris _ et al .",
    "_ also should be examined  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the @xmath16 structure was a high temperature modification of the @xmath15 structure .",
    "here it is shown that because of the non - equilibrium nature of the low temperature regime , the magnetic structure observed is very much controlled by the dynamics and history of the system .",
    "the question of the existence and spontaneous selection of a groundstate in spin ice remains open .",
    "it is surprising that after these extensive travels in @xmath66 space , the materials seem to be arrested on the brink of order .",
    "even at @xmath92 k where the susceptibility is large and there are considerable dynamics available in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 it is unable to locate an ordered groundstate",
    ". it would be interesting to establish how the material becomes jammed in this state and why the dynamics are unable to extend the correlations to long range order .    at low temperatures ( @xmath22 k )",
    "the magnetization of the @xmath4 chains depends on the rate of sweeping the field . in all hysteresis loops observed in this regime ( except one with a slow field sweep rate in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ) the @xmath4 chain magnetization develops discontinuously through a series of jumps . in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , where repeated cycles were made",
    ", the pristine order parameter curve lies outside of the main hysteresis loop which shows that the zero field cooled spin ice state is harder to magnetize than the field - cycled state .",
    "neutron scattering can not identify if the order parameter jumps involve symmetry sustaining first order phase transitions of the type discussed in ref .  , or they are a purely kinetic effect , involving the abrupt growth of macroscopic domains . if the latter , the behavior of spin ice in this regard is reminiscent of random anisotropy ising magnets such as amorphous dy@xmath96cu@xmath97  @xcite where similar magnetization jumps ( like a giant barkhausen noise ) are observed .",
    "field - induced magnetization steps with sweep rate dependence have also been observed in the systems gd@xmath98ge@xmath99 and la@xmath100ca@xmath101mn@xmath102ga@xmath103o@xmath104  @xcite .",
    "both those systems have a field induced crossover from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic groundstate , accompanied by a structural transition .",
    "the steps were attributed to the burst - like growth of ferromagnetic regions in an antiferromagnetic matrix .",
    "the sweep rate dependence is believed to be due to the difficulty of accommodating the structural intergrowths at faster field sweep rates .",
    "such behavior can also be attributed to the existence of two competing groundstates  @xcite . here",
    "we have no structural phase transition but there are two distinctive states at either end of the field sweep , the entropically favored spin ice state in zero field and the energetically favored @xmath16 state in high field .",
    "the situation with the field applied along @xmath2 $ ] is analogous but with a different field induced groundstate .",
    "we suggest that these transitions might be viewed in the same way .",
    "long range order grows in bursts out of the disordered spin system . in the martensitic transitions the bursts are due to the fact that system is well below the energy scale of the electrostatic interactions which maintain the structure and",
    "so the dynamics of the structural rearrangement are extremely slow . here",
    "the system is well below the energy scale of spin - spin interactions and the establishment of the ice rules regime severely restricts dynamics by preventing simple spin flips .",
    "consequently all the transitions are being controlled by the balance of spin - spin interactions and magnetic field , with the small effective temperature promoting metastability .",
    "we have investigated the field - induced order in the spin ices ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the degeneracy removal scheme depends upon the direction along which the field is applied .",
    "as expected , the application of a field along [ 001 ] leads to the selection of a long range ordered state of the @xmath15 type .",
    "application of the field along @xmath3 $ ] leads to the separation of the system into @xmath4 and @xmath5 chains .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath5 chains have a long but finite intrachain correlation length and only a very short interchain correlation length , and that the degree of correlation is history - dependent .",
    "a pathway to spontaneous selection of a long range ordered groundstate was not found , despite partial constraint of the system by the field .",
    "a prevalent feature of the experiments was the strong history dependence , usually manifested as hysteresis on cycling the field .",
    "it is concluded that as the experiments operate on such a long timescale , the dynamics of a spin ice are extremely slow in this temperature range .",
    "these slow dynamics mean that metastable states and coexisting long and short range order could be observed in both orientations .",
    "it was also shown that there is a change of dynamical regime from one in which the spin ice correlations are established but dynamical processes operate , to one in which the spin ice is much more strongly frozen . for measurements such as these",
    "this occurs at @xmath105 k for ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and @xmath52 k for dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
