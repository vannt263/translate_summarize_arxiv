    "quantum periodic finite - gap systems find many interesting applications in physics @xcite@xcite .",
    "they can be related via the algebro - geometric approach with the integrable korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) and modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equations @xcite .",
    "the potentials of finite - gap schrdinger systems correspond to the ` snapshots ' of the evolving in time generalisations of cnoidal waves solutions to the kdv equation @xcite . in a similar way , via the miura transformation , the scalar dirac finite - gap potentials can be associated with solutions to the mkdv equation . the infinite - period limit of such potentials corresponds to reflectionless systems @xcite and the solitary waves solutions to the kdv and mkdv equations .",
    "reflectionless second and first order quantum systems can be constructed via the darboux - crum transformations @xcite from the quantum free particle schrdinger and dirac systems .",
    "the same transformations provide an effective dressing method for construction of lax - novikov integrals for these systems .",
    "the condition of conservation of them generates the higher order nonlinear stationary equations for the kdv and mkdv hierarchies @xcite .",
    "this picture also applies for a more general case of zakharov - shabat  ablowitz - kaup - newell - segur hierarchy @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently in @xcite that the darboux - crum transformations yield a possibility to relate reflectionless systems with different number of bound states in their spectra via a soliton scattering picture .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the pairs of reflectionless schrdinger systems are described not by the ordinary linear or nonlinear @xmath1 supersymmetry , as this happens in the case of ordinary , non - transparent quantum systems related by a darboux - crum transformation .",
    "instead , they are characterised by exotic nonlinear @xmath0 supersymmetric structure .",
    "it is generated by two pairs of the supercharges , which are the @xmath2 matrix differential operators of the odd and even orders .",
    "in addition , the exotic supersymmetric structure includes two bosonic generators composed from the lax - novikov integrals of subsystems , which are differential operators of higher odd - order @xcite .    among all such paired reflectionless schrdinger systems ,",
    "there is a special class , in which two lower - order supercharges have the differential order one . in this case ,",
    "one of the two bosonic integrals transmutes into the central charge of the exotic nonlinear @xmath0 superalgebra , while the second bosonic integral generates rotations between the first - order and even - order supercharges .",
    "one of the first - order supercharges can be reinterpreted as the dirac hamiltonian , which is characterised by its own exotic supersymmetry associated with the central charge of the initial extended schrdinger system .",
    "it is , in fact , the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian , whose potential , being superpotential of the initial extended schrdinger system , provides us with self - consistent condensates . the latter supply us , particularly , with kink and kink - antikink type solutions for the gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "a similar picture related to the exotic supersymmetry was also revealed in the pairs of mutually displaced one - gap lam systems @xcite .",
    "a natural question that appears here is whether the darboux - crum transformations can be employed to unify the reflectionless and finite - gap properties in the same quantum system .",
    "such a quantum system could be associated with the kdv and mkdv equations , and its potential would correspond to solitary wave solutions propagating in a background of finite - gap , cnoidal wave type solutions .",
    "the related question then is what happens with the exotic nonlinear supersymmetric structure in such quantum systems .    in this article",
    "we answer the posed questions . to this aim",
    "we apply the darboux - crum transformations to the quantum one - gap periodic lam system to introduce into its spectrum an arbitrary countable number of bound states in its two , the lowest and the intermediate , forbidden bands .",
    "this procedure will provide us the reflectionless non - periodic one - gap potentials , which will contain two essentially different types of soliton defects in the periodic background in dependence on in which of the two forbidden bands they support the bound states . coherently with this , as it will be shown , the corresponding two types of the bound states possess essentially different properties .",
    "we also investigate the exotic nonlinear supersymmetric structure associated with such quantum systems .",
    "some general mathematical aspects of the theory of the class of the systems we investigate here were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the simplest particular examples were considered in @xcite . for the discussion of the problem of defects in a more general context of integrable classical and quantum field theoretical systems ,",
    "0.1 cm    the article is organised as follows . in next section",
    ", generic properties of the quantum one - gap periodic lam system are summarised , and its infinite period limit corresponding to the simplest reflectionless pschl - teller model with one bound state is discussed in the light of darboux - crum transformations . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider darboux translations for lam system .",
    "we apply darboux - crum transformations in section 4 to introduce soliton defects into the one - gap lam system .",
    "the procedure is developed first to generate arbitrary number of periodicity defects supporting bound states in the lower forbidden band .",
    "then we do the same for the gap separating the allowed valence and conduction bands .",
    "as we shall see , the cases of the even and odd numbers of the bound states in the intermediate forbidden band are characterised by different darboux - crum schemes .",
    "finally , we show how to generalise the construction to introduce the bound states in both forbidden bands .",
    "we discuss also the application of darboux - crum dressing procedure for the construction of the irreducible lax - novikov integrals .",
    "section 5 is devoted to investigation of the exotic nonlinear @xmath0 supersymmetric structure which appears in the extended shrdinger systems composed from two arbitrary one - gap systems with periodicity defects .",
    "special attention is given there for the most interesting from the viewpoint of physical applications case , in which two of the four supercharges are given by the matrix differential operators of the first order .",
    "we consider the cases of the unbroken and spontaneously broken exotic supersymmetries , and indicate the relation of the obtained systems with the kdv and mkdv equations .",
    "the results are summarised in section 6 .",
    "we point out there further possible research directions for the development of the obtained results and some interesting applications .",
    "appendix is devoted to a more technical demonstration of a non - singular nature of the constructed one - gap potentials of a generic form with arbitrary number of the periodicity defects .",
    "in this section we summarise generic properties of the quantum one - gap periodic lam system , and discuss its infinite period limit corresponding to the reflectionless pschl - teller model .",
    "the darboux transformations associate the latter system with a free particle and allow us , particularly , to identify its nontrivial lax - novikov integral via the dressing procedure .",

    "0.05 cm    we showed how by applying the darboux - crum transformations to the quantum one - gap lam system , an arbitrary countable number of bound states can be introduced into the forbidden bands of its spectrum .",
    "these states are trapped by localised perturbations of the periodic potential background of the initial system .",
    "the nature of the perturbations depends on whether they support discrete energy levels in the lower forbidden band , or in the finite gap separating the allowed valence and conduction bands . in the first case",
    "the perturbations have a nature of the smooth soliton potential _ wells _ superimposed on the background of the lam system , while the discrete energy levels in the gap are supported by compression _ modulations _ of the periodic background .",
    "though both types of perturbations have a soliton nature , to distinguish , we identify them here as the @xmath399-type and @xmath712-type defects , respectively .",
    "the nature of the bound states is essentially different in these two cases .",
    "the @xmath713 bound states trapped by the @xmath399-type defects are described by modulated by the background wave functions with finite number @xmath714 of nodes on the real line .",
    "in contrast , the bound states supported by the @xmath712-type defects have infinite number of nodes , and represent oscillating trapped pulses .",
    "the obtained non - periodic systems are reflectionless : their physical states inside the valence and conduction bands are described by the darboux - crum transformed bloch - states of the lam system , just like the scattering states of quantum systems with multi - soliton potentials are given by a darboux - crum transformation of free particle plane waves . similarly to the multi - soliton reflectionless potentials , which exponentially tend to a constant value corresponding to the free particle case , here the asymptotics of the perturbed potentials corresponds to the periodic one - gap lam potential .",
    "we showed that the net phase displacement ( defect ) between @xmath543 and @xmath544 periodic asymptotics of the potential are given by a simple sum of the same parameters which determine , via the elliptic @xmath715 -parametrisation , the discrete energy levels .",
    "the procedure for introducing the @xmath399- and the @xmath712-type periodicity defects has some important differences . in the first case",
    "the order @xmath123 of the darboux - crum transformation corresponds exactly to the number of the introduced bound states . in the second case",
    "the same is true when the number of discrete energy values is even .",
    "the odd number of the discrete energy levels in the gap is obtained by sending one of the already introduced @xmath438 @xmath712-type defects to infinity .",
    "the resulting potential with @xmath447 @xmath712-defects is related to the initial lam system by @xmath438-th order darboux - crum transformation . at the same time",
    ", it can be related by the darboux - crum transformation of order @xmath447 with a singular one - gap treibich - verdier system obtained by a displacement of the regular lam system for one of its two complex half - periods .",
    "the indicated complex displacement can itself be generated by the first - order darboux transformation .",
    "this explains the existence of two alternative darboux - crum transformations whose orders differ by one .",
    "the procedure described in this article allows us to construct the irreducible lax - novikov integrals of motion for the perturbed systems @xmath716 via the darboux - crum dressing of the lax - novikov integral of the initial periodic lam system @xmath11 .",
    "this is similar , again , to the situation with the transparent quantum systems described by multi - soliton potentials , for which the lax - novikov integrals are the darboux - crum dressed form of the momentum operator of the free particle .",
    "the lax - novikov integrals here are differential operators of order @xmath717 for the system with @xmath538 @xmath399-type and @xmath547 , @xmath540 , @xmath712-type defects .",
    "the condition of conservation of these integrals generates a nonlinear differential equation of order @xmath717 for the potential @xmath545 .",
    "this ordinary nonlinear differential equation of odd order in the highest derivative belongs to the stationary kdv hierarchy .    for an extended system composed from an arbitrary pair of the hamiltonians @xmath549 and @xmath550 , which possess @xmath718 , @xmath719 , discrete energy levels in the lower forbidden band and @xmath720 , @xmath721 , bound states in the gap , the presence of the lax - novikov integrals has an essential consequence .",
    "the whole system is now described not just by an @xmath1 linear or nonlinear supersymmetry as would be expected in the case of a darboux - crum related pair of ordinary , non - transparent , or not periodic finite - gap , quantum hamiltonians . instead",
    ", such a system is characterised by an exotic nonlinear @xmath0 supersymmetry that , besides two pairs of the fermion supercharges of odd and even differential orders , involves two bosonic generators composed from the lax - novikov integrals of the subsystems .",
    "we investigated in more detail the most interesting , from the point of view of physical applications , case , when two of the four fermionic supercharges are matrix differential operators of order one .",
    "in this case , one of the matrix lax - novikov bosonic integrals plays a role of central charge of a nonlinear superalgebra , and its commutativity with first order supercharges generates a higher order differential equation for the superpotential which belongs to the stationary mkdv hierarchy .",
    "the second bosonic integral generates rotations between the pair of first order supercharges and the pair of higher order supercharges .",
    "when the spectra of schrdinger superpartners are different only in the lowest discrete energy level present in one of the two subsystems , that corresponds to the almost isospectral case , the superpotential has a topologically nontrivial modulated crystalline kink - type nature .",
    "this case is described by an unbroken exotic nonlinear @xmath722 supersymmetry , in which the ground state is annihilated by all four supercharges and two bosonic integrals . on the other hand , in the completely isospectral case",
    ", the pair of schrdinger hamiltonians is characterised by a superpotential of a topologically trivial , modulated kink - antikink type nature .",
    "such pairs can be obtained from the pairs of almost isospectral case just by sending the @xmath399-type defect associated with the lowest energy discrete value to infinity .",
    "the completely isospectral pairs are described by a spontaneously broken exotic nonlinear @xmath0 supersymmetry . unlike the unbroken supersymmetry case , in such systems",
    "the two states corresponding to the lowest doubly degenerate energy value are annihilated ( in a generic case ) only by the bosonic lax - novikov integrals .",
    "when one of the two first - order supercharges is reinterpreted as the matrix hamiltonian operator , we arrive at the bogoliubov - de gennes system , in which the superpotential will play the role of a scalar dirac potential . the results presented here allow us then , particularly , to obtain new types of self - consistent condensates and associate with them new solutions for the gross - neveu model , which correspond to the kink and kink - antikink type configurations in the crystalline background .",
    "we are going to consider this problem elsewhere .",
    "it is worth noticing that dirac hamiltonians with scalar potential appear , in different physical context , in description of the low - energy charge carriers in graphene and related carbon nanostructures .",
    "this fact opens potential applications of the results in physics of condensed matter systems , following the ideas of @xcite .",
    "the discussed constructions can be generalised to the case of the pt - symmetric one - gap potentials . to achieve this , it is sufficient to apply the complex shift considered in section [ darbtrans ] to the described hermitian systems with periodicity defects .",
    "such systems have an immediate application in the context of the pt - symmetric quantum mechanics and optics .",
    "an interesting development of the presented results is to ` reconstruct ' the time dependence for defects in a periodic background of the one - gap lam system in correspondence with dynamics illustrated , as an example , by figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this would provide us a new class of solutions for the kdv and mkdv equations . at the same time",
    ", it is natural to consider the generalisation of the construction to the case of quantum @xmath123-gap systems with @xmath723 .",
    "one can also wonder if , somehow , both @xmath399-type and @xmath712-type defects are the result of  shrinking \" bands from a more generic finite - gap hamiltonian , under some special limit",
    ".    finally , it would also be very interesting to look for the @xmath724d field theories , in which nontrivial solutions are controlled by stability operator of the schrdinger type @xcite with the potentials of the nature considered here .",
