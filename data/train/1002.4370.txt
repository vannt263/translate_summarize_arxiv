    "the position of s0 galaxies between ellipticals and spirals in galaxy classification schemes @xcite has made them of particular interest in any scenario of galaxy formation and evolution . yet the debate on their origin is open . in the current paradigm ,",
    "the hierarchical lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath17cdm ) cosmology @xcite , the disks are formed first by cooling of gas inside rotating dark matter halos , whereas both the elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies are suggested to have formed in major or minor mergers , respectively @xcite . the bulges formed in this manner are dynamically hot and their basic properties were established already in the merger process @xcite , not affected by the subsequently growing disks . within @xmath17cdm , s0s are formed in galaxy mergers in a similar manner as the elliptical galaxies , or they are transformed from spirals which have lost their disk gas by some stripping mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to study whether the s0 galaxies are more tightly related to ellipticals or to spirals .",
    "however , even if the bulges in s0s were found to be similar to those in spirals , this does not yet answer the question of what the formative processes of bulges in s0s are .",
    "it has been suggested that two types of bulges appear : 1 ) classical merger - built bulges , and 2 ) disk - like bulges formed by star formation in the disk ( kormendy 1982 ; see also review by kormendy @xmath18 kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "boxy / peanut bulges are often listed as a separate class , but as they are assumed to be part of a bar ( athanassoula , lambert @xmath18 dehnen 2005 ) , they are basically disk - related structures .",
    "bulges in late - type spirals are typically photometrically disk - like ( andredakis @xmath18 sanders 1994 ; carollo et al . , 1997 , 1998 ) rotationally supported structures ( cappellari et al . 2007 ) , whereas for the bulges of early - type spirals contradictory results have been obtained . in particular , the fairly large masses of the bulges in the early - type galaxies are difficult to explain by secular evolution alone , related to bar - induced gas infall and subsequent star formation in the central regions of the galaxies ( see kormendy @xmath18 kennicutt 2004 ) , at least if no external intergalactic material is added to the bulge . it needs to be re - investigated what is the nature of bulges of s0s in the nearby universe , e.g. are they disk - like or more likely have properties of merger built structures .",
    "answering this question would set important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "scaling relations have been used for theoretical modeling of elliptical galaxies ( see de zeeuw @xmath18 franx 1991 ) , and for evaluating the formation of galactic disks in spiral galaxies @xcite . therefore , the scaling relations can be used as a tool to study the origin of s0s , which morphologically appear between the two main types of galaxies .",
    "one such scaling relation was introduced by @xcite , who showed , using r@xmath19 models , that the effective radius ( @xmath6 ) is connected to the central surface brightness ( @xmath7 ) , both for elliptical galaxies and for bulges of early - type disk galaxies .",
    "the dispersion in this so - called kormendy relation is reduced by adding a third parameter , a srsic index @xmath8 , leading to the photometric plane ( e.g. khosroshahi , wadadekar @xmath18 kembhavi 2000 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the central velocity dispersion is used , the fundamental plane is obtained ( e.g. djorgovski @xmath18 davis 1987 ; dressler et al . 1987 ) .",
    "other important scaling relations appear between the brightnesses and the scale parameters of the bulge and the disk @xcite , and between the brightness of the bulge with the total galaxy brightness @xcite .",
    "the scaling relations studied for the s0 galaxies so far are open to different interpretations : while the fundamental plane and the kormendy relation have associated their bulges with the elliptical galaxies @xcite , the scale parameters of the bulge and the disk hint to a spiral origin @xcite . in a broader context , scaling relations for spiral galaxy samples have been extensively studied revealing several fundamental relations ( see ravikumar et al .",
    "2006 ; graham @xmath18 worley 2008 as some of the latest works ) .",
    "however , the spiral samples contain just a small number of s0s , which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about s0 properties .",
    "in addition , except for the first attempts by aguerri et al .",
    "( 2005a ) and laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the scaling relations for the disk galaxies have not yet been studied using a 2d multi - component approach , which is important in accounting for structure , particularly in barred disk galaxies ( peng 2002 ; laurikainen et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; gadotti 2008 ) .",
    "in this study the photometric scaling relations are studied for a sample of 175 early - type disk galaxies , mainly s0s in nirs0s .",
    "this is the largest sample of s0s studied in detail up to now .",
    "we use deep @xmath0-band images for decomposing the two - dimensional surface brightness image to structure components , including bars , ovals and lenses .",
    "we present new decompositions for 122 galaxies , and use our previously published decompositions for the rest of the nirs0s sample . as a comparison sample",
    "we use the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey ( osubsgs ; eskridge et al .",
    "2002 ) of nearly 200 spirals , for which similar multi - component decompositions have been previously made by us ( laurikainen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "our main emphasis is to compare whether the photometric properties of bulges in s0s are more similar to those of elliptical galaxies or bulges in spirals .",
    "also , implications of these scaling relations for the formative processes of bulges in s0s are discussed .",
    "our uniform decomposition approach , applied for a statistically significant sample of galaxies , using deep @xmath0-band images , allows us to re - evaluate the properties of bulges and disks in s0s , and to make an unbiased comparison with spirals .",
    "our primary sample consists of 175 early - type disk galaxies , mainly s0s ( 117 s0s , 22 s0/a - sa , 36 sa galaxies ) .",
    "it is part of the near - ir s0 galaxy survey ( nirs0s ) of 184 galaxies , with the following selection criteria from the third reference catalog of bright spiral galaxies ( de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 ; hereafter rc3 ) : @xmath20 @xmath21 12.5 mag , inclination @xmath21 65@xmath22 , and hubble type @xmath33 @xmath21 @xmath23 @xmath211 . or the photographic value @xmath24 , or the average of these two when both are available .",
    "this was done to eliminate contamination of the original sample by total @xmath25 magnitudes in rc3 , which occupy the same column as @xmath26 in that catalog . ]",
    "some of the observed galaxies lie outside the original sample limits for various reasons , usually due to specific weather conditions , e.g. high wind speed , that prevented us from accessing the original sample galaxies . in such circumstances",
    "we often observed a somewhat fainter galaxy ( @xmath26 @xmath11 12.8 ) than in our original sample . in order not to miss the s0s that might be erroneously classified as e galaxies in the rc3 , our sample includes also e galaxies classified as s0s in the revised shapley ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage @xmath18 tammann 1981 , hereafter rsa ) .",
    "we emphasize that in the current study it is not in our interest to re - classify galaxies in the near - ir , instead optical classifications are used .",
    "the observations and the data reductions are described by salo et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ; hereafter slbk ) .",
    "the non - rebinned 2d images typically reach the surface brightness level of 21 - 22 mag arcsec@xmath27 in the @xmath0-band .",
    "the flux calibrations use multiaperture flux measurements in the @xmath16-band , obtained from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) ( skrutskie et al .",
    "the orientation parameters are from slbk , where deep @xmath25-band images were used when available , otherwise @xmath0-band images were used .    as a comparison sample we use the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy sample ( osubsgs ; eskridge et al .",
    "2002 ) , which consists of nearly 200 spiral galaxies , covering the hubble types s0/a - sm .",
    "the selection criteria in osubsgs are similar as in nirs0s except that the apparent magnitude limit is @xmath26=12.0 mag . for 180 of these galaxies",
    "we have previously made multi - component decompositions in the @xmath28-band using the same method as applied in this study for nirs0s galaxies ( see laurikainen et al . 2004 ) . in order to convert the parameters of the bulge and the disk of these decompositions to magnitude units , the images were flux - calibrated using the total @xmath16-band magnitudes given in 2mass .",
    "we thus implicitly assume that the @xmath29 color is constant throughout the galaxy .",
    "as a consistency check we compared and found a good agreement of the photometric parameters for those sa spirals which are common in the nirs0s and osubsgs samples .",
    "it is worth noticing that nirs0s covers the sa type bin better than osubsgs which is why in this study osubsgs is used for the sab - sm galaxies only .",
    "we use a 2d multi - component code , bdbar @xcite , for decomposing the 2d light distribution of galaxies into bulges , disks , bars , ovals and lenses .",
    "this approach has turned out to be important , not only for barred galaxies @xcite , but also for galaxies with ovals and lenses ( prieto et al .",
    "2001 ; laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2009 ) , since these components can have a significant contribution to the total light .",
    "bars in the decompositions have been modeled also by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quantitatively the effect of bars on the fitted model was studied by @xcite , who compared 2d bulge / disk decompositions with bulge / disk / bar decompositions for a sample of 15 s0-s0/a galaxies .",
    "they showed that the mean bulge - to - total ( @xmath12 ) flux - ratio changed from 0.55 to 0.30 and the mean srsic index @xmath8 from 2.6 to 2.1 when bars were taken into account .",
    "including also nuclear bars reduced the mean @xmath12 flux ratio even further to 0.25 .",
    "obviously , bulge / disk decomposition and multi - component approaches represent different views of the concept of the bulge : in simple bulge - disk decompositions for strongly barred and lens - dominated galaxies the @xmath12 flux ratio is more like a concentration parameter than a measure of the relative amount of light in the spheroidal component . in the multi - component approach ,",
    "@xmath12 allows us to measure the relative amount of light of the bulge in a more reliable manner .",
    "this is expected to have implications for the parameters of the bulge and disk , which has to be taken into account when comparing our results with those obtained previously in the literature .",
    "as many s0 galaxies have weak outer disks , it is sometimes useful to apply the 1d decomposition approach @xcite first , which , due to the azimuthal averaging , gives the scale length of the disk in a more robust manner .    in our 2d decomposition code",
    "all components use generalized elliptical isophotes , the isophotal radius being described as : 0.25 cm @xmath30 .",
    "0.25 cm the isophote is boxy when the shape parameter @xmath31 0 , disky when @xmath32 0 , and purely elliptical when @xmath33 = 0 .",
    "circular isophotes correspond to @xmath33 = 0 and minor - to - major axial ratio @xmath34 = 1 . here",
    "the x - axis is along the apparent major axis of the component , having a position angle @xmath35 at the sky .",
    "the origin is at the galaxy center , taken to be the same for all components .",
    "the disk is described by an exponential function : 0.25 cm @xmath36 $ ] , 0.25 cm where @xmath37 is the central surface density , and @xmath38 is the scale length of the disk .",
    "the radius @xmath39 is calculated along the disk plane defined by the assumed position angle @xmath40 and axial ratio @xmath41 of the disk .",
    "@xmath37 is in flux units , and when converted to magnitudes it is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the bulge is described by a srsic s function ( srsic 1963 , 1968 ) : 0.25 cm @xmath42 $ ] , 0.25 cm    where @xmath43 is the central surface density , @xmath44 is the scale parameter of the bulge , and @xmath45 = @xmath46 determines the slope of the projected surface brightness distribution of the bulge ( @xmath8 = 1 for an exponential , and @xmath8 = 4 for the @xmath47-law ) .",
    "@xmath43 expressed in magnitudes is denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is the isophotal radius defined via the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where the subscript stands for bulge .",
    "the effective radius of the bulge , @xmath6 , is the half light radius of the bulge ( the radius of the isophote that encompasses half of the total bulge light ) , obtained by numerically integrating over the profile . according to @xcite for @xmath53 a good approximation",
    "is provided by : 0.25 cm @xmath6 = ( 2/@xmath45 - 0.33)@xmath54 @xmath44 .",
    "0.25 cm    the srsic function can be applied for any non - axisymmetric component , or alternatively the ferrers function can be used ( section 3.2 specifies when these functions are used ) , described as : 0.25 cm @xmath55 , @xmath56 0.20 cm    @xmath57 ,    0.25 cm where @xmath58 is the central surface brightness of the bar component , @xmath59 is the component major axis length , and @xmath60 is the exponent of the model defining the shape of the radial profile . the isophotal radius , @xmath61 , is defined via the parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in the equation the designations are for a bar , but they can refer to any non - axisymmetric component .",
    "0.25 cm      0.25 cm    the decompositions will be used for two purposes : ( 1 ) for morphological analysis , and ( 2 ) for adjusting the images to face - on orientation . for the morphological analysis we use the full advantages of the algorithm , whereas for adjusting the images we need to assume that the bulges are spherical",
    "this is because it is not possible to convert a non - circular 2d brightness distribution into 3d space density in a unique manner .",
    "the inclination - corrected images will be used in a forthcoming paper while analyzing the properties of bars .",
    "0.25 cm    fitting is done in flux units using a weighting function where the pixel weights are inversely proportional to poisson noise .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite the weighting function is not critical for the obtained model . in order to account for the effects of seeing ,",
    "the fitted model is convolved with a gaussian psf , based on the stellar fwhm measured for each image . to obtain reasonable solutions the main structural components need to be identified first .",
    "the identifications were made based on isophotal analysis ( see slbk ) , and on inspection of the original images : the distinction between bars and ovals is based on the ellipticity of the structure ( ovals have lower ellipticities ) , whereas the division between ovals and lenses is not always clear ( see section 5.2 for a definition of bars , ovals and lenses ) .",
    "bars are generally fitted by a ferrers function using @xmath60 = 2 , whereas for ovals and lenses @xmath60 = 1 or 0 are used , giving flatter light distributions and sharper outer edges .",
    "the small @xmath60-values for the lenses are justified because the lenses presumably have a small vertical thickness and the flux drops fairly quickly at the outer edge .",
    "ovals are assumed to have a larger vertical thickness , but the division between ovals and lenses is not always clear .",
    "the srsic function generally worked well for the inner disks , but in a few cases it has also been used for a bar .",
    "0.25 cm    the fitting strategy is the same as used by laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "preliminary solutions were obtained using the images re - binned by a factor of 4 , but the final solutions were found using the full image resolution . in simple cases where the galaxies have only a bulge , an exponential disk and a bar , the solutions were generally found automatically . however , in more complicated cases ( a large majority of the galaxies ) an iterative approach was used .",
    "the scale length of the disk , @xmath38 , was found first ; if the disk was faint the 1d code was used to find @xmath38 .",
    "the other components were found one by one , fixing some of the parameters and leaving the critical parameters free for fitting .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 in the ferrers function was not left free for fitting , otherwise the models for bars , ovals and flattened bulges become easily degenerate .",
    "galaxies that have a secondary bar typically also have a bright oval surrounding it .",
    "as the oval can be as bright as the bar , in some cases both components were fitted by a single ferrers function .",
    "once a satisfactory solution was found , based on inspection of the model image and the fit to the surface brightness profile , all parameters were left free for fitting . however , this last step was not always possible . finally , we checked whether the whole surface brightness profile can be fitted by a single srsic function : this was done to guarantee that we are not erroneously classifying an elliptical galaxy as an s0 .",
    "the seeing fwhm gives a theoretical lower limit for the smallest components in the model .",
    "however , the central components fitted in this study are nuclear bars or disks which clearly exceed this size limit .",
    "the outer disk is fitted to a maximum radial distance where the galaxy is still visible , limited by the standard deviation of the sky background .    0.25 cm      0.25 cm    the decompositions are shown in figure 1 .",
    "for each galaxy the right panel shows the decomposition , whereas in the two left panels the original image ( upper panel ) and the model image ( lower panel ) are shown .",
    "the profiles are shown both in linear and in logarithmic radial scales .",
    "the y - axis in the right panel is the surface brightness given in mag arcsec@xmath27 and the x - axis is the radius along the sky plane given in arcseconds , and plotted are the pixel values .",
    "in such a presentation a spherically symmetric component appears as a curve , while non - axisymmetric components fill an area confined by their major and minor axis exponential profiles .",
    "exponential disk component fills a wedge - shaped region when a linear radial scale is used .",
    "a few representative examples are shown in the paper version , whereas the decompositions for the rest of the galaxies are available in electronic form .",
    "eso 208-g21 is an example of a sample galaxy which turned out to be an elliptical galaxy , in agreement with its classification in the rc3 , while eso 137-g10 is well represented by a simple bulge / disk decomposition . for eso 208-g21",
    "the surface brightness profile declines smoothly , whereas eso 137-g10 has a transition zone between the bulge and the disk .",
    "eso 208-g21 also has a small inner disk .",
    "ic 5328 and ngc 524 are two examples of non - barred galaxies with prominent lenses : ic 5328 has one prominent lens , whereas ngc 524 has at least two lenses , both identified as exponential sub - sections in the surface brightness profile , indicating that multi - component decomposition is preferred . in both cases the lenses are significant enough to affect the parameters of the bulge .",
    "examples of barred galaxies are ngc 6782 and ngc 2950 : for ngc 6782 two ferrers functions are used , one for the nuclear bar and the lens surrounding it , and another for the primary bar and a lens , ending at an inner ring ( b+l ) .",
    "ngc 2950 has two bars and a lens extending outside the primary bar ( b , b , l ) .",
    "some of the s0s and s0/a galaxies in our sample have bulges that are exceptionally small for their hubble type ( ngc 6654 and ngc 4696 ) : such small bulges can appear both in barred ( ngc 6654 ) and in non - barred ( ngc 4696 ) galaxies .",
    "ngc 4696 is classified as an elliptical galaxy in the rc3 , but the galaxy clearly has an exponential disk and a prominent lens . in ngc 6654",
    "the secondary bar is important for making a good fit to the intermediate zone between the bulge and the primary bar .",
    "the main parameters of the bulge and the disk , as well as the inclination used , are collected in table 1 .",

    "however , as we are working in the infrared , the effects of dust are not expected to be severe",
    ". also , we do nt apply any cosmological dimming correction because the galaxies studied are fairly nearby systems .",
    "the magnitude of the bulge is based on the flux of the bulge model , whereas the magnitude of the disk uses the flux obtained by subtracting the bulge flux from the total model ( e.g. , it includes possible bar / oval / lens components ) .",

    "simulations @xcite also show that bulges can form by minor mergers , which are much more frequent in the observed universe . in these simulations ,",
    "minor mergers can heat the original disk and trigger a central starburst , which consumes most of the gas in the galaxy , leaving a featureless gas - poor remnant with an outer disk .",
    "the bulges formed by minor mergers can be dynamically cooler ( younger et al . 2007 ; eliche - moral et al . 2006 ) , but both in major and minor mergers the formation of bulges and disks is expected to be decoupled .",
    "cosmological simulations with merger histories ( e.g. , donghia et al .",
    "2006 ) have , however , faced serious problems which are not yet fully resolved .",
    "for example , they have been unable to unambiguously produce galaxies without classical bulges , or galaxies without any bulges at all .",
    "this contradicts the observation that up to 30@xmath13 of the total stellar mass in nearby disk galaxies might reside in bulge - less galaxies ( kautsch et al .",
    "2006 ; cameron et al .",
    "also , the merger remnants produced in the cosmological simulations are too metal rich , by a factor of 4 - 8 , compared to any observed spheroidals , ellipticals or bulges @xcite .",
    "this is the case at least if the mergers appeared at z @xmath89 0.3 .    as an alternative it is possible that the disks were formed first , and",
    "the bulges were made of the disk material , followed by subsequent star formation ( see kormendy @xmath18 kennicutt 2004 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "the discovery ( illingworth 1981 ) that bulges can rotate and are most likely rotation - flattened oblate spheroids , fits to this picture .",
    "this is suggested to be the case for the bulges in low mass spirals ( see macarthur et al .",
    "2008 ) , but might also be an explanation for the bulges of massive disk galaxies , including s0s .",
    "two examples of such low mass bulges in s0s were discussed by erwin et al .",

    "0.25 cm      0.25 cm    if the photometric properties of bulges in s0s are similar to those of elliptical galaxies , we may assume that also their formative processes are similar , most probably related to galaxy mergers . on the other hand , if the bulges in s0s resemble more the bulges of spiral galaxies , it is possible that they were formed by secular evolution .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that the formation of bulges in all kinds of disk galaxies is under debate , and therefore a possible connection to spirals does not immediately tell what are the physical mechanisms of bulge formation in s0s .    in this study",
    "we have discussed many relations between the photometric parameters of the bulge and the disk in s0 galaxies , which link their bulges more tightly to bulges of spirals than to the elliptical galaxies .",
    "in fact , bulges of s0s are fundamentally different from the elliptical galaxies , which is manifested in the photometric plane ( @xmath6 , @xmath48 and @xmath8 ; fig .",
    "3 ) , in the @xmath2 vs @xmath6 diagram ( fig .",
    "8a ) , and to some extent also in the kormendy relation ( @xmath6 and @xmath9 ; fig .",
    "2 ) . for s0s ,",
    "the luminosities of the bulge and the disk correlate with the total absolute galaxy magnitude , and both also correlate with the @xmath12 flux ratio , in a similar manner as found previously for spirals ( see trujillo et al .",
    "2002 ; balcells et al . 2003 ; carollo et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "there is also a group of s0s with @xmath6 = 0.05 - 0.2 kpc , similar to the values obtained for dwarf elliptical galaxies ( de ) , but having surface brightnesses several magnitudes higher .",
    "simulations suggest that dwarf galaxies can form from bright galaxies which lose their disks in dense galaxy clusters .",
    "however , dwarf galaxies show a large diversity of structures ( lisker et al .",
    "2006 ) , and not all of them are expected to form by galaxy harassment .",
    "it is particularly for the disk - like dwarfs ( ds0s ) that harassment might be at work ( mastropietro et al .",
    "the possibility of several mechanisms being responsible is supported by comparing the photometric properties of des and ds0s with the bulges of bright galaxies in clusters ( aguerri et al .",
    "2005b ) , and also , by comparing the ages and masses of star clusters around pseudobulges in late - type spirals with those obtained in dwarf galaxies ( di nino et al .",
    "however , the simulations by @xcite do not support the view in which also galaxies with initially large bulge - to - disk ratios ( presumably early - type disk galaxies ) could evolve into early - type dwarfs by galaxy harassment . this simulation result is consistent with our result .",
    "bulges of s0s have also characteristics that slightly deviate from those obtained for spirals",
    ". the faint bulges are slightly more compact than the bulges of spirals of a similar bulge luminosity ( fig .",
    "also , contrary to spirals , s0s show no correlation between @xmath2 and the srsic index @xmath8 .",
    "these characteristics could manifest environmental effects : the s0s might have had a more prolonged interaction with the intergalactic matter , or with small companions , both of which may have slightly modified their parameters @xcite .    we may conclude that the bulges of s0s are photometrically fairly similar to the bulges of spirals , but different from the elliptical galaxies .",
    "0.25 cm      0.25 cm    the different formation scenarios of bulges predict different scaling relations for the photometric parameters of the bulge and the disk .",
    "the masses and the scale parameters are expected to correlate if the disks were formed first and the bulges emerged from the disk material by secular evolution . on the other hand , in hierarchical clustering the properties of bulges",
    "were established already during the merger event @xcite , and presumably they changed very little after that .",
    "the disks continue to grow only slightly in mass and size , due to internal dynamical effects , and due to gas falling into the disk .    in this study ,",
    "scaling relations are discussed , suggesting that the formative processes of bulges and disks in s0 galaxies are coupled .",
    "most importantly , the absolute brightnesses of the bulge ( @xmath2 ) and the disk ( @xmath1 ) , indicative of their relative masses , are correlated for s0s ( a correlation @xmath110 ) vs @xmath6 follows from this ) .",
    "for s0s in nirs0s , a correlation exists also between the scale parameters of the bulge ( @xmath6 ) and the disk ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "evidently , there must be some regulation process leading to the above correlations .",
    "the scaling relations we obtain for the spiral galaxies in the osubsgs sample are similar to those found previously for spirals in many similar studies .",
    "an exception is the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath111 ( fig .",
    "10 ) for which @xcite did not find any correlation .",
    "this lack of correlation , together with the lack of correlation between the other parameters of the bulge and the disk ( @xmath112 vs @xmath12 , or @xmath112 vs @xmath113 ) in their study was considered as a challenge for the secular origin of bulges in spiral galaxies : `` bulges do not know how massive their disks are '' .",
    "however , the sample by balcells , graham @xmath18 peletier ( 2007 ) consisted only of 19 spirals , which might explain the lack of correlation .",
    "with our sample of 175 spirals such a correlation is evident , and we conclude that the formation processes of bulges and disks also in spirals galaxies are indeed coupled .",
    "0.25 cm      0.25 cm    the scaling relations discussed above fit a scenario where the disks in a large majority of s0s were formed first , and the bulges emerged from the disk material . in this picture ,",
    "mass transfer towards the central regions of the galaxies is expected @xcite , leading to central star formation , thus adding to the mass of the bulge over a timescale of 1 - 2 gyrs ( athanassoula lambert @xmath18 dehnen 2005 ; bournaud , combes @xmath18 semelin 2005 ; debattista et al .",
    "2006 ; sarzi et al . 2007 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "correlations between the masses and the scale parameters of the bulge and the disk appear .",
    "however , these scaling relations can not be unambiguously used to distinguish between various formation processes of bulges . a correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath6",
    "is expected also if s0s were formed by galaxy mergers : a small companion swallowed by the main galaxy increases the bulge mass , and at the same time the stars in the disk are spread to a larger radius . for spirals",
    "we find median @xmath6/@xmath14 @xmath5 0.10 , and for s0 galaxies @xmath6/@xmath14 @xmath5 0.20 .",
    "compared to the model prediction of @xmath6/@xmath14 = 0.28@xmath30.33 by naab @xmath18 trujillo ( 2006 ) , both values are not well compatible with the merger scenario .",
    "naab @xmath18 trujillo constructed simulation models for galaxy mergers using a large range of mass ratios between the main galaxy and the companion .",
    "the transport of baryonic matter to the central regions of galaxies by minor mergers increases also the srsic index and the mass of the bulge , leading to a correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath8 @xcite . since",
    "secular evolution also produces such a correlation , it does not yield any unique interpretation for the origin of bulges .    in principle",
    ", bulges in late - type spirals can be interpreted as disk - like pseudobulges formed by star formation in the disk . along the same lines , it has been argued that early - type disk galaxies , due to their larger bulge masses , do not have enough gas to produce their bulges in a similar manner .",
    "it has been estimated that secular evolution can produce pseudobulges with masses that contain 10@xmath13 of the total stellar mass in galaxies ( kormendy @xmath18 kennicutt 2004 ) . according to kormendy @xmath18 kennicutt",
    "this is comparable to @xmath12 @xmath5 0.16 .",
    "this is still smaller than the new estimates of @xmath12 = 0.25 - 30 for s0s ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2007 ; balcells , graham @xmath18 peletier 2007 ; gadotti 2008 ; gw2008 ; weinzirl et al .",
    "the estimate by kormendy @xmath18 kennicutt includes only star formation in circum - nuclear rings , so that the @xmath12-value would be somewhat larger if accretion of external gas ( bournaud @xmath18 combes 2002 ) , converted to bulge mass , was also taken into account .",
    "another way of evaluating the formation processes of bulges is to look at their colors .",
    "bulges formed in a hierarchical clustering scenario are expected to be red , whereas bulges formed recently by disk star formation are naturally blue . however , for example accretion of external gas or small blue companions ( aguerri , balcells @xmath18 peletier 2001 ) can rejuvenate the bulges .",
    "the close relationship between the colours of bulges and disks in spiral galaxies ( peletier @xmath18 balcells 1996 ; macarthur et al . 2004 ; cameron et al .",
    "2009 ) is consistent with the idea that bulges in spirals were formed by secular evolution .",
    "but it has also been suggested by driver et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that the global properties of bulge - disk systems might result from the mixing of a red bulge stellar population with a blue disk population , in varying degrees .",
    "therefore , based on colors it is not yet completely clear whether the bulges in spiral galaxies are intrinsically older , rejuvenated by recent star formation , or if they really are young bulges , produced by secular processes .",
    "0.25 cm      0.25 cm    the problem related to the fairly large bulge masses in s0s would vanish if we assume that their bulges were formed by galaxy mergers in the distant past .",
    "however , in that case the obtained scaling relations for s0s , indicating that the bulges of s0s are not like the elliptical galaxies , or that the formative processes of bulges and disks in these galaxies most probably are coupled , would not have any unambiguous explanation . on the other hand , there are many factors that affect the masses of bulges : a ) minor mergers can add mass to an existing bulge , b ) dust can obscure massive bulges , particularly in late - type spirals , and c ) the most massive bulges in s0s might have been formed at higher redshifts in an environment which is different from that observed in the nearby universe .",
    "also , not all bulges in s0s are massive : even 13@xmath13 of them have @xmath12 ratios as small as typically seen in late - type spirals .",
    "0.25 cm    in order to evaluate whether the s0s are stripped spirals , the following picture can be outlined : 0.25 cm    \\(a ) the parameters of the bulges and disks for the s0s in the nirs0s sample are correlated , in a similar manner as for the spirals in the osubsgs sample , supporting the view that the _ formation processes of bulges and disks in these galaxies are coupled_. this is expected if the disks were formed first and the bulges emerged from the disks by secular evolution .",
    "\\(b ) _ the properties of bulges in s0s are fundamentally different from the elliptical galaxies_. this is the case not only for the bright s0s , but also for the faintest bulges , comparable in size with the dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , which implies that the s0s are not likely to be the progenitors of des . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ bulges and disks of s0s are similar to those in s0/a@xmath3scd spirals having bulges brighter than @xmath5 @xmath320 mag in @xmath0-band _ , which is compatible with the idea that s0s are stripped spirals .",
    "\\(c ) _ the bulges of a large majority of disk galaxies were formed by star formation in the disk_. this view is consistent with the above two points , and is supported by the obtained ratio @xmath6/@xmath14 for s0s and spirals : the obtained small values are not easily compatible with the predictions of simulations in which bulges were formed by galaxy mergers .",
    "\\(d ) _ spiral galaxies with bulges brighter than @xmath10 @xmath5 @xmath320 mag , can be transformed into s0s by stripping the disk gas , followed by truncated star formation_. if star formation of the disk in spiral galaxies were truncated 1 - 6 gyrs ago ( see begregal , aragn - salamanca @xmath18 merrifield 2006 ) , it could explain the observed magnitude difference of @xmath5 1 mag in the disk luminosity between s0s and spirals ( see our fig .",
    "spiral galaxies which can evolve into s0s depends largely on the galaxy luminosity , and therefore also on the luminosity of the bulge , and not on the spiral hubble type .",
    "this scenario , where even late - type spirals could be progenitors of s0s , reminds of the early ideas by van den bergh ( 1976 , 1998 ; see also sandage 2005 ) , who suggested that spirals and s0s are spread throughout the hubble classification scheme in parallel tuning forks ( s0@xmath114 , s0@xmath115 and s0@xmath116 ) .",
    "the s0 galaxies studied by van den bergh were fainter than the sa spirals .",
    "therefore he suggested that those s0s with small @xmath12 flux ratios are `` anemic '' sb and sc galaxies , stripped of gas , which leaves only a bulge and a featureless disk .",
    "however , at that time no such galaxies were found .",
    "the s0 galaxies we study are not `` anemic '' , they are not fainter than the early - type spirals . for a representative sample of disk galaxies",
    "the @xmath16-band luminosities of s0s and spirals was studied recently by burstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , showing that s0s and spirals have similar total luminosities . taking into account that fading of star formation should lower the luminosity of s0s , this was considered as a problem for the stripping scenario .",
    "but , on the other hand , increase in the bulge luminosity due to internal dynamical effects might partly compensate the loss of the disk luminosity in s0s .",
    "also , as shown in figure 11 , bright spirals might more easily transform into s0s .",
    "moreover the disks in most s0 galaxies are not featureless : bars are known to be prominent in s0s , nuclear bars are frequent ( erwin @xmath18 sparke 2002 ; laine et al .",
    "2002 ; laurikainen et al . 2009 ) , and even a large majority of non - barred s0s have ovals or lenses ( laurikainen et al .",
    "the large number of bars , rings and lenses in the early - type galaxies is again consistent with the idea that s0s were stripped spirals .",
    "otherwise it would be difficult to understand why these galaxies , deficient of gas , which should make the disk stable , have formed such frequently observed , prominent sub - structures in their disks .    0.25 cm the original idea of s0s as stripped spirals where star formation has ceased comes from the observation by dressler ( 1980 ) , who showed that s0s are common in nearby clusters , whereas spirals are more common in distant clusters .",
    "this has been recently re - investigated for the cluster cl0024 + 16 at redshift @xmath117=0.39 by moran et al .",
    "they found a large abundance of passive spirals ( with only a small amount of hi gas and a low level of star formation ) , which were interpreted as galaxies in a transition state from spirals to s0s .",
    "the number of these galaxies was estimated to be large enough to explain the fraction of s0s in the nearby clusters .",
    "it was suggested by moran et al . ( 2007 ) that the processes to form `` passive '' spirals in a low density interstellar medium could be ram pressure stripping , and in a more dense environment , galaxy interactions , starvation , and gentle stripping of the disks .",
    "however , it has been questioned whether typical spiral galaxy luminosities are sufficient to build up the brightest s0s in local clusters ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ; gerken et al .",
    "a natural solution for this problem comes from the recent study of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) by geach et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who used 24 @xmath118 band spitzer observations .",
    "they showed that the lirgs at z@xmath50.5 can account for the star formation needed to explain the bright end of the s0 luminosity function .",
    "these galaxies have morphological types of sab , indicating that the bulges in the most massive s0s might form already at a fairly early stage of galaxy evolution .",
    "based on an analysis of colors , domnguez - palmero @xmath18 balcells ( 2009 ) obtained a similar conclusion .",
    "there is also other evidence supporting the view that s0s are stripped spirals .",
    "if interactions of galaxies with the intra - cluster medium , e.g. , gas stripping , are responsible for the transformation of spirals into s0s , the number of globular clusters in these galaxies will not be affected . indeed , this is what was found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "results for the tully - fisher ( luminosity vs maximum rotation velocity ) relation hint in the same direction : bedregal , aragn - salamanca @xmath18 merrifield ( 2006 ) explained the location of the s0 galaxies below the spirals ( lower l for a given @xmath119 ) arising from the luminosity evolution of spiral galaxies , in which star formation is ceased . the transformation was assumed to occur over a range of timescales , with the galaxies passively fading in the latest stage of the evolution .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained in this study .",
    "0.35 cm    new 2d multi - component decompositions are presented for 122 early - type disk galaxies , as part of the near - ir survey s0 galaxy survey ( nirs0s ) , using deep @xmath0-band images .",

    "of these galaxies , reliable decompositions could be made for 160 galaxies . as a comparison sample",
    "we use the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy sample ( osubsgs ) of spirals , for which similar multi - component decompositions have previously been made by us .",
