    "following the seminal work  @xcite about electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb ) many models have been proposed in the last years , that intend to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) by sphaleron processes that couple to an axial quark current during a first order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) .",
    "the main reason that this topic attracted such an attention is , that the related elementary particle physics is accessible to experiments these days .",
    "however all models depend on extensions of the standard model ( sm ) since the sm fails on the following grounds :    * lack of cp violation + since the only source of cp violation in the standard model is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix ( apart from the neutrino mass matrix , which provides an even tinier source of cp violation ) one has to face that it is too weak to account for the observed magnitude of bau .",
    "* first order phase transition + sakharov  @xcite pointed out that baryogenesis necessarily requires non - equilibrium physics .",
    "the expansion of the universe is too slow at the electroweak scale and one needs bubble nucleation during a first order ewpt .",
    "the phase diagram of the standard model is studied in detail  @xcite , and it is well known that there is no first order phase transition in the standard model for the experimentally allowed higgs mass .",
    "* sphaleron bound + to avoid washout after the phase transition , the _ vev _ of the broken higgs field has to meet the criterion @xmath0 , i.e. a strong first order phase transition .",
    "this results in the shaposhnikov bound on the higgs mass  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will address the first point - the lack of sufficient cp violation .",
    "the strong first order phase transition is assumed to occur at about @xmath1 gev and is parametrised by the velocity of the phase boundary ( wall velocity ) @xmath2 and its thickness @xmath3 .",
    "it may be induced by adding massive scalars and gauge fields to the sm .",
    "a first attempt to account for the bau within the sm was given by farrar and shaposhnikov  @xcite .",
    "their method was based on reflection coefficients in the thin wall regime and the need of different diagonalization matrices in the broken and the unbroken phases .",
    "however , it has been argued , that the fermion damping by gluons annihilates the coherent modes too fast to account for an axial quark current in the wall  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand one important effect has been neglected by the assumption that the wall is infinitely thin .",
    "the use of a continuous wall profile in the wkb approach  @xcite leads to a dependence of the dispersion relation on the cp - violating phase of complex mass terms .",
    "this effect is in strong contrast to the coherent generation of axial fermion currents as discussed in  @xcite , since in the former case the wall produces a cp sensitive mass of the fermions and the damping is _ required _ to convert this slight mass change into a displacement in the fermionic distribution functions .",
    "a first principle derivation of this dispersion relation and the associated transport equation in the schwinger - keldysh formalism was given in  @xcite .",
    "this formalism is shortly reviewed in the next two sections .",
    "content of the present publication is to generalise this method to several flavors and to the standard model type case , in which the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix is the source of cp violation . a similar mechanism ,",
    "coherent baryogenesis , where mixing of fermionic flavours was used to generate baryon asymmetry , has been recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "we start our analysis with the exact schwinger - dyson equation for two point functions in the closed time path ( ctp ) formalism . after a transformation into the wigner - space they read ( our notation is the usual one  @xcite ; flavor and spinor indices",
    "are suppressed ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inverse free propagator , and we have used the definitions and relations @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the four propagators of the keldysh @xmath8 matrices and all functions depend on the momentum @xmath9 and the average coordinate @xmath10 .    up to this point",
    "these equations are formally exact and hard to solve .",
    "they simplify when expanded in gradients .",
    "the terms on the left hand side will be expanded up to first order , whereas the collisional sources on the right hand side vanish in equilibrium and are just taken up to zeroth order .",
    "the expansion parameter is formally @xmath11 , which close to equilibrium and for typical thermal excitations reduces to @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the temperature and @xmath3 is the phase boundary thickness of the bubbles of the first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "we will perform the calculation in the quasiparticle limit . in practice",
    "this means , that we neglect the last terms on the left hand side , which contain @xmath14 and give rise to a breit - wigner type spectral function  @xcite .",
    "the equations up to first order in gradients are therefore : @xmath15 as additional simplification , one can treat all appearing self - energies as being in equilibrium  which is more crude than a strict linear response approximation , valid close to thermal equilibrium and whose implementation would imply additional integral terms  such that by using the kubo - martin - schwinger condition and the thermal fermionic distribution function @xmath16^{-1 } $ ] ( @xmath17 denotes the plasma vector in the wall frame ) the collision terms in the first equation can be transformed into    @xmath18    we will not solve the full transport equations , but only look for the appearing cp - violating source terms .",
    "the explicit form of the collision term will not be discussed and is generally denoted by @xmath19 , even though it can contain cp - violating contributions  @xcite .",
    "we expect to obtain the usual classical transport equation to order @xmath20 and cp - violating effects to order @xmath21 , which appear at the first order in gradients .",
    "to start with  @xcite we add a pseudoscalar imaginary mass term to the normal dirac operator .",
    "the inverse propagator in a convenient coordinate system , in the wall frame in which a particle moves perpendicular to the wall @xmath22 and in the case of a stationary wall , reads @xmath23 where @xmath24({k^0}^2 - { \\vec k_\\|}^2)^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the wall velocity will enter in the boundary conditions of @xmath25 .",
    "although @xmath26 and @xmath27 are lorentz scalars , they can appear in our solutions only in certain combinations . since a chiral transformation will change the complex mass by a constant phase , but should not have any physical relavance , only the following terms are possible up to second order in gradients ( prime means differentiation with respect to @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) & ( m^2)^ , ^m^2 , ( m^2)^ , ^ m^2 , ( m^2)^ ^m^2 .",
    "& the first cp - violating effect will therefore be at least of first order in gradients .    since the inverse propagator commutes with the spin projector @xmath30 ,",
    "spin is conserved and the spin diagonal entries can be written in the block - diagonal form in spin , & s^<s , s = p_s s^ < p_s = p_s ( s^s_0 _ 0 + s^s_1 1 + s^s_2 i_5 + s^s_3 _ 3 ) , & + & a^<s , s = p_s a p_s = p_s ( a^s_0 _ 0 + a^s_1 1 + a^s_2 i_5 + a^s_3 _ 3 ) . &",
    "a consistent iterative solution of equations ( [ sd1 ] ) and ( [ sd2 ] ) yields the following equations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( for details see  @xcite ) & c s_0^s = 0 , c a_0^s = 0 , & + & k s_0^s = coll . , k a_0^s = 0 , & with the constraint and kinetic operators & c = k_0 ^ 2 - k^2 - m^2 - s , & [ con ] + & k = \\ { c , . } = 2 k_3 _ x_3 - ( m^2)^_k_3 -s _ k_3 . & [ kin ]    analyzing the behaviour of these operators under cp conjugation , we can identify the cp - even ( index @xmath33 ) and cp - odd ( index @xmath34 ) parts as follows , & c^e = k_0 ^ 2 - k^2 - m^2 , c^o = - s , & + & k^e = 2 k_3 _ x_3 - ( m^2)^_k_3 , k^o = -s _ k_3 . & the correctly normalized solutions for the spectral functions @xmath32 are a_0^s & = & i sign(k_0 ) ( _ k_0c ) ( c ) . in this form",
    "we can immediately see , that the axial current will not contain any cp violation if the wall velocity vanishes , since this would permit the solution s_0^s & = & f_f(k u = k_0 ) a_0^s and the collision terms would vanish",
    ". this solution does not contain any cp violation : @xmath35 is the zero component of the vector current and odd under cp , while @xmath36 is the three component of the axial current and even under cp .",
    "the semi - classical picture of this process is clear .",
    "the wall profile gives a spin dependent and cp - violating dispersion relation to the fermions .",
    "but this effect can not lead to an axial current as long as the boundary conditions are invariant under a sign change of @xmath37 .",
    "if the wall is moving , this symmetry is broken and this leads to an axial current .",
    "a good measure for the cp violation in the system in this context is the relative shift of the poles of the dispersion relation ( [ con ] ) = s .",
    "in the standard model the jarlskog determinant  @xcite is believed to be an upper bound on cp violating effects .",
    "the basis for this relation is the following reasoning : suppose the sm lagrangian contains two nonhermitian mass matrices for the quarks ( due to the coupling to the higgs field , denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) while the coupling of the lefthanded quarks to the w bosons is still proportional to unity in flavour space .    using four unitary flavour matrices for the",
    "left / right handed up / down quarks ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) the lagrangian can be written in terms of the mass eigenstates ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "the unitary matrices for the right handed quarks have no physical significance , while the product of the left handed up / down matrices lead to the ckm matrix in the coupling term between left handed quarks and w bosons ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "these lagrangians are not in one - to - one correspondence : if we started with mass matrices , that needed the same left handed but different right handed transformation matrices , we would end up with the same ckm matrix , and the same diagonal mass matrices .",
    "if we express now our measurable quantities by the primary nondiagonal mass matrices , only combinations are allowed that do not include the right handed transformation matrices after diagonalisation .    in the sm the combinations of lowest dimension , that fulfill these requirements are the matrices",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 , and it turns out that the first cp sensitive contribution is the jarlskog determinant & & -0.3 in ( det[m_u m_u^ , m_d m_d^ ] ) + & = & tr(c m_u^4 c^m_d^4 c m_u^2 c^m_d^2 ) + & & -2j m_t^4 m_b^4 m_c^2 m_s^2 , [ jarlsdet ] has dimension 12 , and is suppressed by the 12th power of the w boson mass , or in a thermal system at least by the 12th power of the temperature . on these grounds the first physical effect would be of order  @xcite & ( ) ^7 j m_t^6 m_b^4 m_c^2 m_s^2 ~10 ^ -22 , & [ shapbound ] where @xmath49 denotes a specific combination of the angles of the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the kobayashi - maskawa parametrization  @xcite @xmath50 it is given by j & = & s_1 ^ 2s_2s_3c_1c_2c_3 ( ) = ( 3.00.3)10 ^ -5 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .    the calculation of the last section can as well be performed with several flavours .",
    "a numerical solution of the system shows , that the constraint equation ( [ con ] ) contains a term & ( tr[m_u m_u^ ] ) & [ gen8 ] as a generalization of ( [ delpol ] ) .",
    "this term is only of dimension 3 and provides the possibility to circumvent the upper bound ( [ shapbound ] ) if one includes contributions that can produce these terms , e.g. corrections due to the thermal self - energies .",
    "this inclusion is needed since the derivatives of the mass matrices are proportional to the mass matrices themselves .",
    "therefore the generalization ( [ gen8 ] ) can have no contribution on tree level .",
    "even more stringent is the prejudice  ) , but rather an effective action which includes one loop self energy corrections .",
    "a reflection calculation off a thin ( step ) wall performed in the mass eigenbasis then results in cp violating quantities , which can be much larger than the jarlskog invariant , but which are in general not rephasing invariant .",
    "an important difference between the two treatments is that we have obtained our result by working in the flavour eigenbasis ; rotating the kadanoff - baym equations  ( [ sd2 ] ) into the mass eigenbasis would namely lead to nontrivial derivative corrections  @xcite which are not present in the effective action approach . ]",
    "that , in an expansion of the self - energy in masses , the most important contribution will be of the form ( [ jarlsdet ] ) such that the bound ( [ shapbound ] ) still seems to hold . however , this argument is based on the assumption , that the convergence of an expansion in the mass parameters is fast , and this turns out not to be the case .",
    "the hermitian part of the thermal self - energy of the quarks in the standard model reads  @xcite @xmath54 with @xmath55 hermitian @xmath56 matrices , @xmath57 an arbitrary @xmath56 matrix , all depending on @xmath28 , the external energy @xmath58 , and the external momentum @xmath59 in the restframe of the plasma , @xmath60 the left / right - handedness projection operators and @xmath61 again the plasma vector .",
    "in general all these coefficients can contain cp - violating contributions , but we will focus on the mass term , since it leads to the generalisation of terms of the form ( [ delpol ] ) .",
    "the mass part of the thermal self - energy of the down quarks in the mass eigenbasis has the form m_d & = & h_1 m_d + _ w c h_2 c^m_d + & & + _ w^2 c h_3 c^ h_4 c h_3 c^m_d + & & + o(_w^3 ) , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend only on @xmath64 , while @xmath65 and @xmath66 depend on @xmath67 . the integral",

    "-0.25 in [ fig4 ]    note that the first derivative of @xmath65 is in a broad range of parameter space @xmath88 of order _ unity _ or even larger .",
    "furthermore in the limit of vanishing external mass the sign of @xmath87 changes in the range , where the internal quark mass agrees with the mass of the charged higgs boson @xmath89 .",
    "the self - energy behaves non - perturbative in the sense that , when expanded in the mass of the internal quark , the main contributions come from higher powers of @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) the derivative @xmath87 is plotted versus the mass of the up quark in the loop .",
    "here it is obvious that the effect is based on a resonance in the loop and can not be increased arbitrarily by increasing the mass of the quark in the loop .",
    "-0.25 in [ fig6 ]    it is reasonable to expect the functions @xmath66 and @xmath63 to be after integration effectively of order one as well and not proportional to unity in flavour space .",
    "this allows an estimate of the cp - violating pole dependence of the down quarks @xmath91 ( we have used the standard model value @xmath92 and that most of the particles carry a momentum of the order of the temperature ) which is seven orders of magnitude larger than the constraint  ( [ shapbound ] ) , but still much too small to account for the bau .",
    "we have seen , that in spite of the enhancement of the axial current , the cp - violating source due to the ckm matrix is too weak to account for the bau .",
    "thus we will discuss in this section further possibilities to generate terms of the form  ( [ delpol ] ) in extensions of the sm .",
    "one attractive alternative is the extension to supersymmetric models .",
    "analytical  @xcite and lattice  @xcite studies show that the additional scalars in the theory of mssm may lead to a ( two stage , see however @xcite ) first order phase transition in a part of the parameter space fulfilling the sphaleron bound .",
    "however the occuring cp violation in the chargino and neutralino sector has to be maximal and the higgs mass at the borderline to be seen experimentally to explain the observed bau  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the current accuracy in the measurements of electric dipole moments  @xcite only leaves a small window in parameter space of the mssm and could rule out this model soon as a source of baryogenesis . an nmssm type model  @xcite leaves more freedom at the expense of further parameters .    besides supersymmetric models ,",
    "more general two higgs doublet models are most appealing in extending the sm to explain the bau _ via _ electroweak baryogenesis . in a certain region of parameter space according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the phase transition is of first order and the sphaleron bound is fulfilled .",
    "this derivation assumed the two higgs _",
    "vev_s to be proportional to each other thus simplifying the calculation while the general case so far has not been completely studied .",
    "baryogenesis is not compatible with this assumption , since if the quotient of the two higgs _",
    "vev_s is constant , it is not possible to generate an axial fermion current _ via _ ref .",
    "( [ delpol ] ) .",
    "therefore the character of the phase transition has to be examined in every specific model",
    "seperately .",
    "since these models are not subject to the stringent restrictions of supersymmetry , there are several possibilities to introduce new sources of cp violation .",
    "one feasible approach is to avoid flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) by construction , what leads to the so called type i and type ii models ( for a comprehensive discussion see ref .",
    "an additional source of cp violation in this context is the complex phase between the two higgs fields  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the supersymmetric case this model can , with a reasonable choice of parameters , just marginally explain the generated bau to be consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "another possibility , even if less attractive because of minor predictivity , is to admit fcncs at the tree level , called two higgs doublet models type iii . due to the large parameter space",
    "these models still resist to be ruled out by experiments ( for some implications on experimantal bounds see @xcite ) even with quite natural choices for the new parameters and impressive experimental lower bounds on fcnc processes .",
    "the rich phenomenology can even account for deviations from the sm as for example the difference between the measurement of the @xmath93 muon factor and it s sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "the main difference to models without fcnc and particularly the sm is , that during the electroweak phase transition the derivatives of the mass matrices are not necessarily proportional to the mass matrices themselves .",
    "this gives the possibility to construct cp odd rephasing invariants of the form ( [ gen8 ] ) on the tree level and even with just two flavours .",

    "the effect can be for example quite large in a two - stage phase transition , as it was seen in ref .",

    ".    the resulting pole shift will be of order & & || , and for the top quark this is approximately & ~ & , with @xmath13 the temperature and @xmath3 the wall thickness .",
    "the high degree of arbitrariness in these models opens this way a large window for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "we have shown that , due to a resonance in the quark self - energies , the cp - violating pole shift induced by the ckm matrix at high temperatures can be by about seven orders of magnitude larger than the cp - violating shift navely expected from the jarlskog invariant .",
    "however , the effect is still too small to account for the bau _ via _ baryogenesis from the standard model cp violation at the electroweak phase transition .",
    "finally we point out that smallness of the cp violation in the standard model can be resolved within a certain class of two higgs doublet models .",
