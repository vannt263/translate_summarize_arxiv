    "recently , much effort has been directed toward realizing single - mode optical waveguides where the guided photons can be tightly confined in the transverse directions to an area @xmath0 near or below the diffraction limit .",
    "such confinement is desirable in part because it allows for a large interaction strength between single photons and nearby coupled atoms .",
    "specific systems that have recently been explored in this context include tapered optical fibers  @xcite , hollow - core photonic crystal fibers  @xcite , and surface plasmons on conducting nanowires  @xcite .",
    "the propagation and interaction of photons in such a medium can be controlled by interfacing them with atoms using quantum optical techniques such as electromagnetically induced transparency  ( eit )  @xcite . in particular , our scheme relies on resonantly enhanced optical nonlinearities with low losses  @xcite using eit and the creation and trapping of stationary pulses of light in the medium using spatially modulated control fields  @xcite  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fourlevels]a ) . as will be shown , the dynamical evolution of the photonic system is governed by an equation that has the form of the nonlinear schrdinger equation  ( nlse ) , where the signs and strengths of the effective mass and interaction can be controlled using external fields . under conditions where the nonlinear interaction is large and effectively _ repulsive _ , the tg regime of photons can be achieved .",
    "specifically , we consider the propagation of counter - propagating quantum fields , characterized by operators @xmath1 , inside a single - transverse mode optical waveguide and interacting with cold atoms in the four - level configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourlevels]b .",
    "the fields @xmath2 couple the ground state @xmath3  ( in which the system is initialized ) to excited state @xmath4 with a strength given by @xmath5 , while metastable state @xmath6 and @xmath4 are coupled by classical , counter - propagating control fields @xmath7  ( we assume these fields are also guided ) . here , the lambda configuration consisting of states @xmath8 comprise the typical eit setup . in particular",
    ", in the case where the quantum and classical fields propagate only in one direction , the quantum field can be dynamically and reversibly mapped into a stationary spin - wave excitation by turning the control field @xmath9 to zero adiabatically . on the other hand , as shown in  @xcite , by creating a standing wave formation with the control fields  ( @xmath10 ) , the quantum fields can be effectively stopped while simultaneously maintaining a non - zero photonic component of the excitation  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fourlevels]a ) . intuitively , the standing wave pattern forms a set of reflection gratings that trap the photonic excitations through multiple scattering .",
    "the nonlinear response is introduced via an additional state @xmath11 that is coupled to @xmath6 by the quantum fields  ( for simplicity we assume that this coupling strength is also given by @xmath5 ) .",
    "when these fields are far off resonance , this coupling results in an ac stark shift of state @xmath6 whose magnitude is proportional to the intensity of the quantum field  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to an intensity - dependent refractive index , or nonlinear susceptibility , that in turn influences the evolution of the quantum fields .",
    "while similar schemes for realizing nonlinear optics in atomic media have been previously explored  @xcite , their implementation in waveguides with tight confinement is unique because they can constitute a true one - dimensional system , and because the strong transverse localization enables large nonlinear interactions .",
    "considerable theoretical literature exists discussing the connection between maxwell s equations for a nonlinear medium in one dimension and the lieb - liniger model ( llm ) describing interacting massive particles  @xcite .",
    "however , most of this work has focused on the regime of attractive interactions .",
    "interest in this regime stems from the observation that interaction with basic two - level atomic systems leads to photon bunching , since it is easier for many photons to pass through an atom without being absorbed  @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the attractive regime is the formation of solitons  @xcite .",
    "this regime of the llm has few quantum mechanical features and can be described by classical equations of motion .",
    "indeed , typical optical solitons contain on the order of a million photons , and therefore a quasi - classical description is very appropriate  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ repulsive _ case is intrinsically  quantum mechanical \" , as one needs to keep track of correlations at the level of individual particles .",
    "solutions based on perturbation theory or classical equations of motion break down and one needs to use non - perturbative approaches such as the bethe ansatz solution  @xcite or the luttinger liquid formalism  @xcite .",
    "thus , formation of a tg gas of photons is fundamentally a collective _ many - body _ effect .",
    "we now derive an evolution equation for the fields of the system illustrated in figure  [ fig : fourlevels ] . following the methods of  @xcite , we define dark - state polariton operators @xmath12 describing the coupled photonic and spin - wave excitations , which in the slow - light limit are given approximately by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density of atoms coupled to the waveguide  ( the density is assumed to be uniform ) .",
    "we specialize to the case when @xmath15 .",
    "we further assume that the quantum and control fields vary slowly in time , such that the fast - varying atomic operators can be adiabatically eliminated , while the remaining slowly - varying operators are solved in the adiabatic limit . subsequently inserting these solutions into the maxwell - bloch equations describing evolution of the quantum fields",

    "when @xmath26 , the interaction with the atoms induces an effective attraction between photons . as discussed above , this is responsible , _",
    "e.g. _ , for the formation of bound states  ( solitons ) when a large number of photons are present . on the other hand , for @xmath27",
    "the regime of effective _ repulsion _ between photons is realized .",

    "( [ llconstants ] ) , one finds that the regime of repulsion can be achieved if exactly _ one _ of the detuning parameters @xmath19 or @xmath29 is negative .",
    "it is also clear that only the attractive regime can be reached using a two - level system , since @xmath30 in this situation .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath31 , which underscores the importance of tight mode confinement in reaching the strongly interacting regime .",
    "one useful feature of this realization of the nlse is that the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath32 can be dynamically tuned by varying different parameters of the system .",
    "specifically , both are functions of detuning , and thus @xmath33 can be altered by changing either the control field frequencies or by externally manipulating the energies of the atomic levels . as described below",
    ", this tunability facilitates the creation of novel photonic states .",
    "the process by which novel photonic states can be prepared and detected consists of three basic steps  loading of the pulse , controlled evolution under the nlse , and readout of the final photonic state ",
    "each of which we now describe . during the initial loading process , a resonant optical pulse , given by , _",
    "e.g. _ , a coherent state , is incident from one direction .",
    "it is injected into the waveguide at the same time that the co - propagating control field  ( say @xmath34 ) is turned on . during the loading procedure the counter - propagating control field @xmath35 is off .",
    "this describes the usual situation in eit , where the input field becomes spatially compressed upon entering the medium and propagates with a variable group velocity @xmath36 .",
    "once the pulse completely enters the medium , @xmath34 is adiabatically turned to zero , reversibly converting the photonic excitation into a pure spin - wave excitation in the atomic medium  @xcite . under certain conditions",
    "this input pulse can be stored with minimal distortion relative to the initial field  @xcite , such that all relevant properties  ( _ e.g. _ , field correlations ) remain constant during the loading . following the initial storage ,",
    "both control fields are then adiabatically switched on , with @xmath37 , during which the pulse becomes trapped and evolves under eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlse ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath32 can be changed in time during the evolution to reach the final state of interest .",
    "once this state has been achieved , the pulse is released by turning one of the control fields  ( say @xmath38 ) off , thereby allowing the pulse to propagate undistorted until it exits the waveguide  @xcite . during this readout of the pulse , any spatial correlations that formed while evolving under the nlse",
    "are directly mapped into temporal correlations  ( at a common point in space ) in the outgoing field , which can be measured using standard quantum optical techniques .",
    "a characteristic signature of a strongly interacting gas is the appearance of friedel oscillations  @xcite in the normalized second - order correlation function , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the stationary pulse intensity prior to release .",
    "in particular , if the photonic state is close to the ground state of the llm , @xmath41 contains an oscillating part that behaves as @xmath42  ( see methods ) , where @xmath43 is the fermi momentum in the tg limit . in the tg limit",
    ", the ground - state correlation function takes on a simple form given by lenard s formula  @xcite , g^(2)_tg(z , z)=1-()^2 .",
    "the @xmath44-oscillations are a direct manifestation of `` fermionization '' of bosons .",
    "we note that friedel oscillations are more than simple anti - bunching in that they indicate real crystal correlations .",
    "in particular , one can not predict the position of an individual photon , but knowing the position of one photon , other photons are likely to follow at well - defined distances determined by the average photon density .",
    "these correlations are predicted to decay relatively slowly in space .",
    "the usual definition of the tg regime of the ll model is given with respect to the equilibrium state .",
    "however , in our system the evolution of the initial coherent state under the nlse inherently involves non - equilibrium quantum dynamics , and hence one must specify the conditions under which one can obtain a strongly interacting state of photons that is close to the ground state of the llm and exhibits its characteristic features , such as friedel oscillations . specifically , we consider the evolution of a pulse under eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlse ] ) , where the atomic parameters are varied such that the effective mass @xmath23 is constant in time , while the interaction strength @xmath45 increases exponentially . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , the resulting time - dependent interaction parameter can be written in the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the rate of increase , and @xmath48 corresponds to the `` fermi energy '' at the center of the pulse before expansion .",
    "we assume that @xmath49 , so that the system initially consists of non - interacting photons , and interactions are gradually switched on to reach the regime with @xmath50 . here",
    "we will not discuss the effect of a time - dependent mass , although it can be included using a similar analysis .",
    "we also note that the related problem involving the sudden switching of the interaction strength from zero to a large value has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of the llm model has previously been studied in the context of ultracold atoms and has focused either on changing the interaction strength in a system with uniform , constant density  @xcite , or on the expansion of particles in a system with constant interaction  @xcite . in our system",
    "both processes take place , but in the experimentally relevant regime of a large photon number there is a separation of time scales that simplifies the analysis .",
    "we consider an initial pulse containing @xmath51 photons with spatial extent @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "our discussion applies for a general pulse shape and thus we need not specify it .",
    "there are three distinct regimes in the time evolution of the pulse : i ) interactions are weak and the photons expand freely due to dispersion ; ii ) interactions begin to dominate over the kinetic energy .",
    "however , the system is still in the weakly interacting regime with @xmath54 , in which case the expansion is hydrodynamic  @xcite ; iii ) the system reaches the strongly interacting regime with @xmath55 , and the expansion resembles that of fermionized bosons  @xcite .",
    "a simple analysis  ( see methods ) shows that by the time the system reaches regime iii ) , the relative change in the photon density at the center of the pulse is only of the order of @xmath56 .",
    "hence for @xmath57 one can assume that the turning on of interactions takes place at a constant density and any subsequent expansion takes place in the tg regime .",
    "we now consider the effect of non - adiabaticity on correlation functions such as @xmath41 . by analogy with ultracold atoms ,",
    "we introduce a chemical potential , which in regimes i ) and ii ) is given by @xmath58 .",
    "we can approximately separate the turning on of interactions into two stages , which both take place during the regimes i ) or ii ) . in the first stage ,",
    "@xmath59 and the evolution is diabatic . in the second stage ,",
    "@xmath60 and the evolution is essentially adiabatic . at the time @xmath61 separating the two regimes ,",
    "the interaction parameter is given by @xmath62 .",
    "the first stage can be thought of as an instantaneous projection of the wavefunction , which gives rise to a finite density of excitations characterized by an effective healing length @xmath63 at time @xmath61 . during the second stage ,",
    "the number of excitations does not change .",
    "hence , we find that the finite rate of change in the interaction strength leads to a finite correlation length in our system , @xmath64 . for length scales shorter than @xmath65 ,",
    "all correlation functions are essentially the same as in the ground state , whereas for length scales longer than @xmath65 , correlation functions rapidly decay . to observe friedel oscillations over length scales on the order of the inter - photon distance , for example , requires that @xmath66 . the argument presented above",
    "can be turned into a quantitative calculation for the correlation functions following the time dependent change in the interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses bosonization to treat the llm and the conclusions agree with the qualitative picture presented here .    at the end of regime",
    "ii ) we have a system of `` fermionized '' hard core photons that should exhibit friedel oscillations . in regime iii ) , the pulse of `` hard - core photons '' expands , but such spreading does not lead to the suppression of the friedel oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the problem of expansion of hard - core photons starting from a general pulse shape has to be analyzed numerically .",
    "however , an explicit analytic solution is available for the case of a parabolic pulse shape . under realistic conditions",
    "this solution , which is discussed in detail in the methods section , yields the correlation function shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : tg ] .    in principle , during the evolution one must also consider the effects of photon losses , which set a maximum evolution time @xmath67 and interaction parameter @xmath68 that can be achieved before a substantial fraction of the initial pulse is dissipated . as derived in the supplementary information  ( si ) ,",

    "while photon losses limit the maximum evolution time , somewhat surprisingly , the nonlinear losses may also help in bringing the system closer to the ground state of the llm model .",

    "deep in the tg regime we can estimate the time it takes for the system to lose the high energy states , @xmath80 . on the other hand , the photon loss rate is @xmath81 .",
    "thus @xmath82 and for large @xmath33 there is a sufficient time window for the high - energy states to decay before too many photons are lost .",
    "the above analysis indicates that strongly correlated states of photons can be controllably prepared and observed in one - dimensional waveguides .",
    "these techniques are made possible through strong coupling between the photons and nearby atoms and the use of quantum optical techniques such as eit , which allow the system to be widely tunable .",
    "such photonic states should find numerous applications in various areas of physics .",
    "crystal correlations that arise in the fermionized state make it a promising candidate for applications in metrology and quantum information .",

    "<S> one famous example is the tonks - girardeau  ( tg ) regime of interacting bosons in one dimension , in which strong interactions between particles lead to an effective  fermionization \" of bosons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this unusual regime has been explored in several condensed matter systems and in recent experiments with ultracold atoms in one dimensional traps  @xcite . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the feasibility of creating and detecting a tg gas of photons . </S>",
    "<S> this system would correspond to nonlinear quantum optics in its extreme , in which individual photons behave as impenetrable particles . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , an optical pulse separates into non - overlapping wavepackets of individual photons , and a  crystal of photons \" can be created .    </S>",
    "<S> several papers have recently considered the possibility of phase transitions involving photons , focusing on large systems of coupled optical cavities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present study extends this important work along two principal directions . </S>",
    "<S> first , while dramatic progress has been achieved in controlling individual atoms and photons in single cavities  @xcite , the complex architecture of coupled cavities proposed in  @xcite represents a considerable experimental challenge . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , </S>",
    "<S> the approach described here to realize a tg gas of photons involves currently available experimental techniques . </S>",
    "<S> second , we show how signatures of a strongly interacting photon gas can be detected using standard quantum optical measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this potentially enables many new applications and allows one to study even more exotic phenomena involving interacting particles using readily controlled photons with tunable interactions . </S>"
