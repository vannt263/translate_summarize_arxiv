    "this link.@xcite    what makes the spin - triplet proximity effect in a half metal particularly interesting from a theoretical point of view , is that there is a symmetry argument that strongly limits the effectiveness of a spin - active interface as a source of spin - triplet superconducting correlations.@xcite this symmetry argument applies to the case of a half metal , but not to a standard ferromagnet ( with incomplete spin polarization ) .",
    "it essentially forbids andreev reflection of majority electrons into majority holes or vice versa if five key conditions are met:@xcite particle - hole symmetry , translation symmetry along the superconductor interface , @xmath1-rotation symmetry around an axis normal to the superconductor interface , quasiparticle conservation , and the absence of minority carriers .",

    "impurity - assisted andreev reflection not only gives rise to a finite zero - bias conductance , but also to a strong enhancement of the josephson current at low temperatures .",

    "comparing the josephson current for a clean interface and the impurity - assisted contribution , we find that the impurity - assisted contribution dominates if @xmath211 where we again took the current in the clean case in the limit of a low transparency of the hs interface .",
    "again , this condition is independent of @xmath139 and @xmath212 , because the dependence of the josephson current on these parameters is the same ( proportional to @xmath213 ) for clean and dirty interfaces .",
    "we have verified through explicit calculation that impurities in the vicinity of a half - metal  superconductor ( hs ) junction with a magnetization gradient perpendicular to the interface ( spin - active interface ) qualitatively change the dependence of the andreev reflection amplitude @xmath102 on the quasiparticle energy @xmath2 and , hence , the bias dependence of the interface conductance @xmath9 and the temperature dependence of the josephson current @xmath214 of a superconductor  half - metal  superconductor ( shs ) junction . without impurities , one has @xmath215 at low energy.@xcite in contrast , impurities give rise to a nonzero value of @xmath102 for @xmath129 .",
    "interestingly , the zero - bias conductance of a hs junction and the low - temperature josephson current of an shs junction increase upon increasing the impurity concentration at the interface .",
    "although it was to be expected , based on general symmetry considerations , that impurity scattering leads to a nonzero andreev reflection _ probability _",
    "@xmath216 , we found the remarkable result that a nonzero amplitude @xmath217 remains after taking an average over impurity locations and potentials .",
    "it is this coherent impurity - assisted andreev reflection that is responsible for the increase in the low - temperature josephson current and the superconducting correlations at low frequency that we predict .",
    "the nonzero average persists if an average over the fermi surface is performed .",
    "there is an important difference between the impurities in the immediate vicinity of the interface we considered here , and impurities at a larger distance into the half metal .",
    "only impurities in the half metal that are within a minority - electron wavefunction decay length from the interface may enhance andreev reflection . within a quasiclassical approach ,",
    "such impurities are considered as part of the interface , and they are an integral part of the boundary conditions that have to be applied at the half - metal  superconductor interface .",
    "impurities that are located farther into the half metal lead to scattering of quasiparticles before and after andreev reflection , but such impurities are not involved in the andreev reflection process itself .",
    "their effect can be treated with standard methods from quasiclassics or the scattering matrix approach , which combine normal - state propagation inside the half metal with the andreev - reflection boundary conditions at the half - metal ",
    "superconductor interface.@xcite in any case , since the induced superconducting order is of @xmath28-wave type for both clean and disordered spin - active interfaces , impurities away from the interface will only have a minor effect on the superconducting order induced in the half metal .",
