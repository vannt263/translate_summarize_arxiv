    "star formation begins with the creation of dense molecular cores , and understanding how cores grow and evolve is essential to identifying the origin of stellar properties @xcite . through the 1990s ,",

    "current observations , however , indicate that magnetic field strengths are insufficient to provide the dominant support of molecular cores @xcite .",
    "in addition , over the past decade , a conception of star formation has emerged in which supersonic turbulence drives structure and evolution within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) on a wide range of scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . because supersonic turbulence can compress gas to densities",

    "following @xcite but generalizing to three dimensions , we consider core building and evolution in the turbulence - dominated , unmagnetized limit .",
    "observations of dense cores in gmcs have provided detailed information on individual core properties as well as statistics of core populations ( see e.g. , the reviews of * ? ? ?",

    "the center - to - edge density contrast is frequently larger than the maximum possible for a stable be sphere , however , and the inferred temperatures based on static be fits are also often larger than observed temperatures .",

    "this conclusion is also supported by magnetic field zeeman observations @xcite , indicating that cores have mean mass - to - magnetic - flux ratios twice the critical value .",
    "thus , magnetic field effects appear to be sub - dominant in terms of supporting cores against collapse , and ambipolar diffusion does not appear to control the dynamics of core formation and evolution . as magnetic fields are non - negligible , however , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) stresses may still affect gmc and core dynamics .",

    "dense cores form inside a spherical shock that propagates outward within the converging flow . over time",

    "eventually , the core collapses to create a protostar following the same `` outside - in '' pattern as in models initiated from static conditions .",
    "subsequently , the dense envelope falls into the center via an inside - out rarefaction wave @xcite ; this is followed by a stage of late accretion if the converging flow on large scales continues to be maintained .",

    "each simulation models a localized region of a turbulent cloud in which there is an overall convergence in the velocity field . under the assumption that there is a dominant convergence direction locally ,",
    "we choose inflow along a single axis , so that convergence is planar . with the more realistic geometry afforded by the current simulations ,",
    "we are able to check the results obtained by @xcite for core building and collapse in supersonic flows . we are also able to explore how the characteristic core mass is related to the velocity of the converging flows . since the speed of converging flow is assumed to reflect the amplitude of the largest - scale ( dominant ) motions in a gmc , this relates the characteristic core mass to the turbulent mach number in its parent gmc .",
    "although a number of previous studies of core formation have been conducted , the present investigation is distinguished by our systematic study of mach number dependence , together with our focus on internal structure and kinematics of the cores that form .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we provide a physical discussion of self - gravitating core formation in the post - shock dense layers , identifying the mass , size , and time scales expected to be important . in section 3 ,",

    "we demonstrate that this method can be used for both three dimensional and two dimensional data with similar results , and can thus be applied to find cores in observed clouds .",
    "section 6 describes the relations between core properties ( core mass , core radius and core collapse time ) and the large - scale mach number of the converging flow , relating to the expectations from gravitational instability discussed in section 2 . in section 6",

    "section 7 summarizes our new results and discusses our findings in the context of previous theories and observations .",
    "prior to describing our numerical model prescription and results , it is useful to summarize the scales that are likely to be relevant for formation of self - gravitating cores in gmcs .",
    "we shall assume approximately isothermal conditions , consistent with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the isothermal sound speed at a temperature @xmath9 is @xmath50 if the density within clouds were uniform , the spatial scale relevant for gravitational instability would be the jeans length @xmath51 evaluated at the mean density @xmath2 .",

    "of course , gmcs are highly inhomogeneous , with core formation taking place in the overdense regions that have the shortest gravitational times .",
    "if the overdense regions within gmcs are produced by shocks in the turbulent , supersonic flow , their density , and therefore the mass scale and length scale for growth of self - gravitating structures , will be related to the shock strength .",
    "strongly magnetized shocks have less compression than weakly magnetized shocks ( while both will be present in a turbulent flow ) , so we concentrate on the latter case .    if gravitationally unstable cores develop only in gas that has been strongly compressed by shocks , the actual bounding pressure will be much larger than @xmath61 . in particular , an isothermal shock with mach number",
    "@xmath35 will produce a post - shock region with pressure @xmath62 .",
    "thus , if cores preferentially form in stagnation regions between shocks of mach number @xmath35 , then one can define an effective bonnor - ebert mass for these core - forming regions within the turbulent flow by setting @xmath63 in equation ( [ m_be ] ) : @xmath64 the above simple argument suggests @xmath65 for the minimum mass of a star that forms via collapse of a core in a turbulent cloud with velocity dispersion @xmath11 , mean density @xmath2 , and temperature @xmath9 .    equation ( [ m_be_ps ] ) provides a mass scale for fragmentation within post - shock regions , but in fact instabilities take some time to develop .",

    "the domain in the @xmath162 direction is smaller than in the @xmath181 and @xmath182 directions since the reversed shock generated by the inflow only propagates a relatively short distance and the post - shock dense layer is thin , i.e. , the basic geometry remains planar .",
    "the domain in the @xmath162 direction is large enough so that the post - shock layer does not evolve to reach the @xmath162 boundaries .",
    "we note that our assumption of perturbed velocities but uniform densities in the inflowing gas is not fully realistic , since the flow entering a strong shock within a gmc will in general have internal density structure .",
    "in fact , the velocity perturbations we introduce do lead to moderate ( order - unity ) density fluctuations , as we have found by conducting comparison simulations with self - gravity turned off .",
    "these density fluctations are what seed the growth of self - gravitating structures .",
    "the main emphasis of the current work is to investigate how the development of self - gravitating structures depends on the inflow mach number , which sets the mean density ( and hence the gravitational timescale ) in the post - shock layer ; previous studies have not tested the mach number dependence of gravitational fragmentation . by varying the velocity perturbation amplitudes of the inflow , we have begun to explore the effect of pre - existing density structure on self - gravitating core development in shocked regions .",
    "this exploration can be extended and made more realistic ( in terms of upstream structure ) by investigating internal evolution of shocked layers within larger fully - turbulent clouds having a range of mean mach number ; we are currently pursuing a numerical study along these lines .",
    "the models presented here may be thought of as investigating self - gravitating structure growth within the first strong shocks to develop inside a cloud .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , @xcite proposed a unified model for core formation and evolution in supersonic turbulent environments .",
    "based on spherical - symmetry numerical simulations , four stages were identified : core building , core collapse , envelope infall and late accretion .",
    "the duration of each stage , and the structure and kinematics of cores at varying stages were also analyzed .",
    "while the comparison of those results to observations is very encouraging , the assumption of spherical symmetry is clearly unrealistic .",
    "one of the key goals of this work is to check if core building and collapse still develop in a similar manner when the spherical - symmetry assumption is relaxed . because the time step becomes very short in late stages , we halt the simulations ;",
    "thus the current models do not address envelope infall and late accretion stages .",

    "the top panel of each column shows the surface density very early on ; the patterns are identical but the amplitudes are different .",
    "the bottom panel shows the surface density when the most evolved core collapses for each case .",
    "hereafter we shall use @xmath218 to denote the total time to reach collapse of the most evolved core , in terms of the code unit @xmath219 ( eq . [ tj_def ] ) .",

    "these three simulations have low initial perturbation amplitude ( cf .",
    ". [ pert_ampl_f ] ) .    from figure",
    "[ fig : comp_mach ] , two features are immediately apparent .",
    "first , the input perturbation field patterns determine the later structural evolution and there is a `` family resemblance '' for the models at different mach number .",
    "this is because the post - shock dense layer retains a memory of the perturbation velocity fields in the direction parallel to the plane of the layer since @xmath227 and @xmath228 are unchanged across the shock interface . comparing the first plot to the last plot of each column , cores form in regions where the density perturbation amplitudes are initially higher than the surroundings as a result of convergence in the @xmath229 plane .",
    "these overdense regions develop into long , thin filaments , within which cores grow and then collapse .",
    "second , the specific properties of cores , such as the total number and individual volumes ( as well as their masses ) , are determined by @xmath35 .",
    "the dense cores for @xmath215 are smoother than the cores for @xmath217 , and they cover larger areas . during the middle and late stages of evolution , more small scale filamentary structures",
    "are evident in the higher mach number cases . at a given scale ,",
    "the input @xmath227 and @xmath228 perturbations are higher for larger @xmath35 , with the resulting compressions making more prominent `` burrs '' around cores .",
    "the `` burrs '' are also less smoothed for the high mach number cases , because the shorter free - fall time at the higher post - shock density means that the core collapses sooner .",
    "thus , as the velocity of the converging flow and additional perturbations increases , the result is smaller , denser , more irregular , and more `` hairy '' cores .",
    "figure [ fig : vx_vy_proj ] shows evolution of surface density and the mean in - plane velocities @xmath230 and @xmath231 for the @xmath232 model shown in figure [ fig : comp_mach ] .",
    "the mean velocities are calculated by @xmath233 with @xmath234 or @xmath228 .",

    "the large - scale spatial correlation of these overdense regions is evident , however , even at early times .",
    "the mean velocities also have small amplitudes at early stages .",
    "the large - scale converging ( in - plane ) velocity regions that eventually lead to the most prominent filaments are already evident from the first frames , however . at late stages , the overdense regions start to collect into filaments .",
    "the converging ( in - plane ) velocities grow due to self - gravity of the forming filaments ; in addition , purely hydrodynamic instabilities ( such as the nonlinear thin - shell instability , e.g. @xcite ) in the shock - bounded layer may enhance early growth of perturbations .",
    "when converging in - plane flows become supersonic , discontinuities in the density and velocity develop .",
    "these sharp fronts , as well as the collapsing motions centered on the most evolved cores , are evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : vx_vy_proj ] at @xmath235 .",
    "thus , we see that turbulent motions even at sub - pc scales seed the growth of structures , and self - gravity reinforces and amplifies these motions .",
    "the growth of dense cores and larger scale filaments is simultaneous , both a consequence of turbulence and self - gravity .",
    "similar to our results in @xcite for spherical symmetry , we find that core building lasts most of the time up to @xmath218 , while the core collapse itself is rapid for the most evolved cores .",

    "the first instant for both cases is subcritical ( i.e. @xmath268 ) and the second instant is close to @xmath269 .",
    "the dramatic increase of the central density during collapse is clearly evident for both cases , and the collapse develops in an `` outside - in '' manner with the maximum in @xmath11 moving inward in time .",

    "we have conducted , the peak of the velocity profile becomes supersonic only at the very end of the collapse stage , similar to the results shown here .",

    "the core building stage lasts over @xmath246 of the time to collapse , and cores become more stratified over time .",
    "the onset of the collapse is in an `` outside - in '' manner , and leads to a dramatic increase in the central density . as a central singularity",
    "is approached , the density and velocity profiles approach the `` larson - penston '' asymptotic solution . these cores form and collapse within larger - scale filaments that also grow in contrast over time .",
    "the algorithm adopted for core - finding can either subtly or more seriously affect the core properties that result ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most commonly - used methods in observational work are based on contouring column density or emission intensity ( e.g. the popular _ clumpfind _ method of * ? ? ?",
    ". for theoretical work , density - contouring methods , sometimes incorporating further tests to determine if a structure is gravitationally bound , have frequently been used ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . here",
    "we shall instead use the gravitational potential isosurfaces to identify cores .",
    "in very recent work , @xcite took a similar approach , noting that one advantage of the gravitational potential is that it yields smoother core boundaries than the density .",
    "another advantage is that the gravitational potential connects more directly to the fundamental physics that determines core evolution . during formation stages ,",
    "self - gravity gathers material to build up cores , and later it drives the collapse of supercritical cores .    to identify cores via the gravitational potential , we first find and mark all the local minima of the gravitational potential ; second , we find the largest closed potential contour ( or isosurface ) surrounding each individual minimum . in the second step ,",
    "we increase the contour level from the bottom of a given potential well step by step until it violates another minimum s marked territory .",
    "we define the region enclosed by the largest closed contour as a core .",
    "the contour interval @xmath272 has negligible effect on the results as long as it is small enough ( typically @xmath273 ) .",
    "if the distance between two minima is smaller than 10 pixels ( corresponding to a physical distance @xmath274 for @xmath275 ) , the regions associated with these two minima are merged and treated as a single core .",
    "since we do not continue the simulation after the most evolved core collapses , we apply the algorithm to the last output from each simulation .",
    "since gas with sufficient thermal and kinetic energy need not be permanently ( or even temporarily ) bound to a given core , the gravitational potential is not the final word .",
    "the lower density outer parts of a core are the most subject to loss .",
    "we can test this effect on core identification by adding thermal energy to the gravitational energy , and only assigning a given fluid element to a core if @xmath276 . for any fluid element ,",
    "the specific thermal energy is taken to be @xmath277 , and the specific gravitational potential energy is taken to be @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the potential of the largest closed contour that defines the core . for a core embedded within a dense filament ( or sheet ) may be much lower than @xmath280 for the same core in isolation . in assessing whether a core is bound , it is crucial to take tidal gravity effects into account .",
    "if these tidal effects are neglected , @xmath280 will be overestimated by a factor @xmath281 , which is quite large if the contrast between a core and its surroundings is modest . ] including a thermal energy condition in core definition decreases the volume ( or area in 2d ) of the cores .",
    "of course , the thermal energy can in fact be radiated away , so that gas that is initially near the largest closed contour may become more strongly bound after the interior of a core collapses . in this case",
    ", the potential alone could determine the final core mass .",
    "short of following cores through the final stages of star formation , we consider it useful to compare cores with and without a thermal - gravitational energy criterion .",
