    "since johnson & hogg ( 1965 ) reported the first three ring nebulae around wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , nebulae of various shapes , sizes , and ionization conditions have been observed around massive stars of different spectral types , such as luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , blue supergiants ( bsgs ) , and red supergiants ( rsgs ) . as these various spectral types in the upper part of the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram are strung together by the evolutionary tracks of massive stars ,",
    "their surrounding nebulae must be evolutionarily related .",
    "this relationship was illustrated clearly by garca - segura , langer , & mac low ( 1996 ) and garca - segura , mac low , & langer ( 1996 ) in their hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of wr ring nebulae taking into account the evolution and mass loss history of the central stars .    in this review",
    ", i will cover three topics .",
    "first , i will present a gallery of ring nebulae around massive stars throughout the hr diagram and compare them to garca - segura et al.s framework of hydrodynamic evolution of circumstellar gas around massive stars .",
    "second , i will report an x - ray view of the hot gas in the interiors of bubbles blown by massive stars , using rosat , asca , chandra , and xmm - newton observations .",
    "finally , i will compare the circumstellar nebulae observed around young supernovae ( sne ) to those around massive stars and use the nebular properties to diagnose the spectral types of sn progenitors .",
    "the hydrodynamic models of ring nebulae around massive stars by garca - segura et al .  considered two possible stellar evolution tracks from the main sequence ( ms ) to the wr phase : ms o @xmath0 lbv @xmath0 wr , for a 60 m@xmath1 star ; ms  o @xmath0 rsg @xmath0 wr , for a 35 m@xmath1 star .",
    "stars at these different evolutionary stages expel stellar material in the following ways : ms o stars possess tenuous , fast winds with terminal velocities of 1,0002,000 km  s@xmath2 ; rsgs have copious , slow winds with wind velocities typically a few 10 s km  s@xmath2 ; lbvs have outbursts or winds at modest velocities that depend on the stellar luminosities ; wr stars have the most powerful stellar winds with both large mass loss rates , @xmath3 m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 , and high wind velocity , up to 3,000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these stellar winds interact with the ambient medium and form ring nebulae with distinct characteristics for each type of central stars .      the fast stellar wind of a ms o star sweeps up the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) to form an _",
    "interstellar bubble _ ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ) , which consists of a dense shell of interstellar material .",
    "intuitively , we would expect around most o stars an interstellar bubble similar to the bubble nebula ( ngc 7635 ) to be visible ; however , hardly any o stars in hii regions have ring nebulae , suggesting that these interstellar bubbles are rare .",
    "this puzzle is recently solved by observations of the young hii region n11b in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "while no ring nebulae can be identified morphologically , long - slit high - dispersion spectra have revealed expanding shells around single or groups of o stars ( see fig .",
    "1a , b ; naz et al .",
    "their expansion velocities , typically 1015 km  s@xmath2 , are not much higher than the isothermal sound velocity of the 10@xmath4 k ionized gas in the hii region , and consequently can not produce strong shock compression . lacking large density enhancements , these slowly expanding interstellar bubbles do not have visible ring nebulae .",
    "interstellar bubbles blown by ms o stars may become morphologically identifiable at later evolutionary stages when the central stars can no longer ionize the bubble shells and the surrounding ism .",
    "a 10 km  s@xmath2 expanding shell in a 100  k neutral hi medium ( isothermal sound velocity @xmath5 1 km  s@xmath2 ) is highly supersonic , thus can generate strong compression and produce an identifiable shell morphology .",
    "such recombined interstellar bubbles have been observed as hi shells around wr stars ( cappa 2002 , and references therein ) . a beautiful hi shell around wr 134 in our galaxy reported by gervais & st - louis ( 1999 )",
    "is reproduced in fig .",
    ".      evolved massive stars at the rsg phase lose mass via slow winds and form circumstellar nebulae .",
    "because of the high dust content , these circumstellar nebulae are best observed through the optical continuum scattered by dust or the thermal ir continuum emitted by dust .",
    "this is illustrated by vy cma ( m5e  ia ) in fig .",
    "the optical reflection nebula of vy cma , visible to a radius of 9000 au ( for a distance of 1.5 kpc ) , is asymmetric about the central star .",
    "the presence of bright arcs indicates that localized ejection of stellar material may have occurred on the stellar surface ( smith et al .",
    "more details on mass loss and circumstellar nebulae of rsgs are reviewed by humphreys ( 2002 ) .",
    "the name lbv has been used for both the extreme case of @xmath6 car and the less luminous s doradus variables .",
    "the ofpe / wn9 stars have also been loosely called lbvs .",
    "the circumstellar nebulae of lbvs have been reviewed by nota et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . using the heavy element abundances of lbv nebulae , smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that lbvs have gone through a brief rsg phase , while lamers et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrate that the nebulae are ejected during the blue supergiant ( bsg ) phase and that the lbvs have never gone through a rsg phase .",
    "most circumstellar nebulae around lbvs are small , @xmath72 pc in diameter , expanding shells with v@xmath8 of few 10 s km  s@xmath2 ( nota et al .",
    "1995 ; weis 2002 ) .",
    "many lbv nebulae in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds have been studied recently by , e.g. , nota et al .",

    "( 1997 , 1999 ) , and weis ( 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "a large compilation of images of lbv nebulae were presented in the poster by weis in this meeting .",
    "3 shows the intriguing runaway lbv s119 and its nebula in the lmc ; the interstellar absorption lines in the fuse spectrum of s119 have established unambiguously that it is in the lmc ( danforth & chu 2001 ) .      in the last decade",
    ", sensitive surveys of wr ring nebulae have been made using ccd cameras with interference filters for the galaxy ( miller & chu 1993 ; marston et al .",
    "1994a , b ; marston 1997 ) and the magellanic clouds ( dopita et al .",
    "the identification criteria in these surveys are similar to those used in the 70 s and 80 s . based on nebular dynamics , chu ( 1981 ) find three types of wr ring nebulae : r - type nebulae are not dynamically shaped by the wr stars , w - type nebulae are bubbles blown by the wr stars , and e - type nebulae are ejecta nebulae .",
    "garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) show that a wr star is surrounded by an inner circumstellar bubble and an outer interstellar bubble .",
    "the interstellar bubble was blown by the progenitor of the wr star at the ms phase , while the circumstellar bubble is blown by the wr star in the circumstellar nebula ejected by the progenitor of the wr star at the rsg or lbv phase .",
    "both the e - type and w - type wr ring nebulae refer to the circumstellar bubbles .",
    "if the circumstellar bubble is too tenuous to be detected , then the outer interstellar bubble may be ionized and become a r - type wr ring nebula .",
    "it is thus clear that the three types of wr ring nebulae defined by chu ( 1981 ) are not mutually exclusive . in particular",
    ", there is no physical distinction between w - type and e - type nebulae .",
    "bearing in mind that the optically identified ring nebulae around wr stars may refer to either the circumstellar bubbles or the interstellar bubbles , it is thus meaningless to make statistical statements about  the percentage of wr stars in visible ring nebulae , \" unless distinction is made between the circumstellar and interstellar cases .",
    "wr ring nebulae have been studied in multiple wavelengths . using the differences in h@xmath9 and [ oiii ] images , gruendl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) presented a morphological diagnostic for dynamical evolution of wr bubbles .",
    "the most dramatic contrast between h@xmath9 and [ oiii ] morphology is illustrated in the hst wfpc2 images of ngc6888 in fig .",
    "4 ( moore , hester , & scowen 2000 ) .",
    "hi 21-cm line observations have revealed neutral gas shells of diameters a few 10 s pc around wr stars ; the properties of these shells are consistent with those expected in the interstellar bubbles blown by the ms progenitors ( see review by coppa 2002 ) .",
    "observations of molecular gas associated with wr ring nebulae have yielded many intriguing results : ( 1 ) circumstellar co associated with wr16 ( marston et al .  1999 ) and possibly ngc6888 ( rizzo et al .",
    "2002 ) ; ( 2 ) complex molecules and shock - excited interstellar h@xmath10 and nh@xmath11 in ngc2359 ( st - louis et al .  1998",
    "; rizzo , martn - pintado , & henkel 2001 ) ; ( 3 ) interstellar molecular gas around ngc3199 ( marston 2001 , 2002 ) .      the bsg phase has no unique meaning . any massive star that is blue and luminous",
    "is called a bsg .",
    "if it varies , then it is called a lbv . the existence of a close binary companion can make the nature of a bsg even more mysterious .",
    "a small number of circumstellar nebulae around bsgs have been identified .",
    "ironically , almost all of them have something peculiar about either the spectral properties of the stars or the physical structure of the nebulae .",
    "below are a few examples .",
    "ngc6164 - 5 around hd148937 consists of a small ( 2.6 @xmath12 1.9 pc ) s - shaped circumstellar nebula and a filamentary interstellar ring nebula ( @xmath5 10 pc in diameter ) inside a large dusty cavity structure ( leitherer & chavarra - k .",
    "1987 ) . clearly , hd148937 is an evolved star , but its spectral type , o6.5f?p , is peculiar and it shows well - marked emission in ciii and niii lines that are not seen in normal of stars ( walborn 1972 ) .",
    "what is the evolutionary status of hd148937 ?",
    "sk@xmath1369  202 ( b3i ) , the progenitor of sn1987a , and sher  25 ( b1.5i ) are both bsgs and have circumstellar ring nebulae of similar size and morphology ( brandner et al .",
    "1997a , b ) . the hourglass morphology of these two rings are uncommon among known ring nebulae around massive stars ; in fact , no other ring nebulae have such a morphology .",
    "do these ring nebulae provide circumstellar or circumstantial evidence for a similar evolutionary status between these two bsgs ?",
    "podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu ( 1992 ) have proposed that sk@xmath1369  202 is a product of a massive interacting binary ; their model explains the bsg spectral type of the star and the formation of the equatorial ring in the circumstellar nebula .",
    "interestingly , a compact circumstellar nebula has been observed around the massive eclipsing binary ry scuti ( smith et al .",
    "1999 ) ; another circumstellar nebula has been detected around the b[e ] supergiant r4 and is suggested to be ejected during a binary merger process ( pasquali et al .",
    "these circumstellar nebulae clearly have different formation mechanisms from those around single massive stars .",
    "the circumstellar nebula of sher  25 , resembling that around sk@xmath1369  202 , most likely has a similar formation mechanism , which then requires sher  25 to involve a massive interacting binary . unless observations of sher  25 can exclude this possibility , the ring nebula of sher  25 provides circumstellar evidence that it is similar to sk@xmath1369  202 .",
    "observations of ring nebulae around single massive stars with known evolutionary status generally agree with expectations : + ( 1 ) ms o stars blow interstellar bubbles of sizes @xmath5 a few @xmath1210 pc , + ( 2 ) rsgs are surrounded by circumstellar nebulae of sizes a few @xmath1210@xmath14 au , + ( 3 ) lbvs have small circumstellar bubbles with radius @xmath151 pc , + ( 4 ) wr stars have larger circumstellar bubbles , a few pc in size , surrounded by +   interstellar bubbles blown by their progenitors at ms stage .",
    "+ the circumstellar nebulae , consisting of material ejected by the stars , are n - enriched and can be diagnosed by a high [ n  ii]/h@xmath9 ratio .",
    "lbvs may evolve into wr stars , and the sizes of their circumstellar bubbles ( chu , weis , & garnett 1999 ) support this evolutionary sequence .",
    "on the other hand , ring nebulae around massive stars with uncertain evolutionary status , such as bsgs , show complex structures that are not completely understood . this is an area that needs a lot of future work .",
    "ring nebulae around close massive binaries also need to be studied .",
    "bubbles blown by massive stars ought to be filled by shocked fast stellar wind at x - ray - emitting temperatures ( weaver et al.1977 ) . the first detection of diffuse x - ray emission from the hot gas in a bubble interior was made by einstein ipc observations of ngc6888 ( bochkarev 1988 ) .",
    "rosat pspc observations of several wr ring nebulae detected only ngc6888 and s308 ( chu 1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from ngc6888 is brighter toward the dense shell rim , and the x - ray spectrum indicates a plasma temperature of 1.6@xmath1210@xmath16 k ( wrigge , wendker , & wisotzki 1994 ) .",
    "rosat pspc observations of s308 is severely affected by the occultation ring , making the extraction of x - ray spectrum difficult and unreliable ( wrigge 1999 ) .",
    "asca observations of ngc6888 show an additional faint component at 8@xmath1210@xmath16 k ( wrigge et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the advent of chandra and xmm - newton finally makes it possible to study the distribution and physical conditions of the hot gas in bubble interiors . to date",
    ", ngc6888 has been awarded a 100 ks chandra acis - s observation in cycle 4 , and s308 has recently been observed with xmm ( chu et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the x - ray image of the northwest quadrant of s308 .",
    "for the first time , the relative locations of the interior hot gas and the cool shell are resolved ! a gap of 0.5 pc between the boundary of hot gas and the leading edge of the cool , dense bubble shell is observed ; this gap would correspond to the interface region where heat conduction takes place .",
    "it is interesting to compare the hot interior of s308 to those of planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "the progenitors of pne have initial masses up to @xmath510 m@xmath1 , which corresponds to mid - b type stars , which are qualified as  massive stars . \"",
    "pne are believed to be formed by the current fast stellar winds interacting with the former slow winds at the agb phase ( kwok 1983 ) , a mechanism almost identical to that for the formation of a wr bubble with a rsg progenitor ( garca - segura et al .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission has been detected in four pne ( chu , guerrero , & gruendl 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "figure 7 shows that the hot gas in pn interiors has temperatures of 23@xmath1210@xmath16 k , while s308 has the coolest interior , only @xmath51@xmath1210@xmath16 k. these temperatures are much lower than the post - shock temperature for a 10003000 km  s@xmath2 fast wind . clearly , mixing with the cool nebular material has taken place ( e.g. , pittard et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "more x - ray observations of ring nebulae around massive stars are needed to constrain bubble models .",
    "one of the most intriguing questions about massive stellar evolution is  at what locations in the hr diagram do massive stars explode as sne ? \"",
    "only two sne s progenitors have adequate data to estimate their spectral type : b3i for sn1987a ( walborn et al.1989 ) and k0i for sn1993j ( aldering , humphreys , & richmond 1994 ) .",
    "mass limits of sn progenitors have been estimated from photometric measurements using pre - explosion images ( smartt et al . 2001 , 2002 ; smartt 2002 ) .    an alternative way to estimate a sn progenitor s spectral type is through the physical properties of the circumstellar nebulae , which can be identified by narrow emission lines in high - dispersion spectra of sne .",
    "the expansion of the nebula can be derived from the widths of line profiles , and the nebular density and temperature can be derived from the [ oiii ] and [ nii ] lines . a variety of circumstellar nebulae have been observed .",
    "sn1997ab and sn1997eg both showed a narrow p cygni h@xmath9 line , implying the existence of circumstellar nebulae with densities @xmath1710@xmath18 @xmath19 and expansion velocities 100150 km  s@xmath2 ( salamanca et al .",

    "these narrow p cygni lines disappeared in observations made in march 1999 , indicating that they are small ( gruendl et al .",

    "the progenitor of sn1978k might have exploded at the lbv phase .",
    "sn1998s showed rapid variation in the narrow nebular line profiles during the first month after the sn explosion , indicating that the sn ejecta was plowed through a circumstellar nebula with a range of densities ( fassia et al .",

    "<S> observations of ring nebulae around massive stars not only are fascinating , but also are useful in providing templates to diagnose the progenitors of supernovae from their circumstellar nebulae . in this review , i will summarize the characteristics of ring nebulae around massive stars throughout the hr diagram , show recent advances in x - ray observations of bubble interiors , and compare supernovae s circumstellar nebulae with known types of ring nebulae around massive stars .    # 1_#1 _ # 1_#1 _ =    # 1 1.25 in .125 in .25 in    # 1=.6 # 1=.75 # 1#2=.35 = .35 # </S>",
