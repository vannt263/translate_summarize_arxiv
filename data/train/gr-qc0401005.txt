    "recently wang , zheng , yao , and langley@xcite ( wzyl ) have verified by experiment an effect , which is indeed the sagnac effect seen by a uniformly moving observer .",
    "wzyl s experiment actually shows that what matters is that light moves along a closed circuit and that the observer is in motion with respect to the circuit .",
    "the observer needs not rotate for the effect to appear .",
    "the sagnac effect has been the object of innumerable papers@xcite@xcite and has stimulated an almost one century long debate on its meaning and interpretation .",
    "most of this debate is rather surprising since the effect is perfectly well described and understood in the framework of special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "a simple way to describe and derive the effect in sr consists in a purely geometrical approach",
    ".    in the traditional configuration one has to do with a uniformly rotating observer ( angular velocity @xmath0 ) and two light rays obliged to stay on a circle ( radius @xmath1 ) by an optical fiber or a cylindrical mirror .",
    "drawing a space - time diagram of the situation , one has world - lines drawn on a cylinder@xcite , like in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the graph is even clearer when one considers that the cylinder is a flat surface , i.e. a minkowski two - dimensional space .",
    "we are then allowed to cut the cylinder along a generatrix , and to open it on a plane leading to fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] .",
    "2 actually displays the same situation as fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the cyclical periodicity implies that @xmath2 and @xmath3 coincide with @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is proportional to the sagnac delay .",
    "a simple calculation@xcite gives the result@xmath6 in the first order approximation this is traditionally written as@xmath7and one says that the proper time difference is proportional to the area @xmath8 encircled by the beam .",
    "actually , considering geometry and the fact that lengths are involved , it would be more appropriate to write ( [ sagnac2 ] ) in the form ( first order)@xmath9where @xmath10 is the length of the path as seen by an inertial observer at rest with respect to the axis of the system , and @xmath11 is the velocity of the observer in the initial direction of both the co - moving and counter - moving rays .",
    "( [ sagnac3 ] ) is the one written by wzyl .",
    "formula ( [ sagnac2 ] ) has been considered as universal , however it is the product of a fortuitous coincidence when light and observer are both rotating along the same circumference .",
    "let us now consider the more general situation depicted in fig .",
    "3 .    now there is an observer coinciding with the source / receiver of light and steadily moving along the straight line between @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "the line joining @xmath12 and @xmath1 may be thought of as an optical fiber or a mixed path including mirrors and fibers , guiding light beams in both directions ( from @xmath13 to @xmath1 and viceversa ) .",
    "light emitted by @xmath4 forwardly enters the guide in @xmath12 and exits in @xmath1 , aiming at @xmath4 .",
    "light sent backwardly does the reverse .",
    "a simple , almost trivial , argument shows that light emitted in both directions in a single burst is received back at two different instants .",
    "the proper time difference measured by @xmath4 will be:@xmath14    again the formula coincides with the one written by wzyl . now it is evident that no connection exists with rotations and with the area enclosed in the path of light . what matters are the length of the contour and the speed of the observer , which in this case is an inertial one .",
    "of course @xmath15 is parallel to the light rays in @xmath16 .",
    "using the geometrical approach the result is rather obvious . in space - time",
    "the world lines are drawn again on a cylinder .",
    "the only difference is that on fig .",
    "1 the cylinder had a circular cross section , now the cross section is rather irregular . in any case",
    "the cylinder is a flat bidimensional minkowski surface and , when opening in a plane , the graph is exactly like in fig .",
    "the accidental introduction of the area @xmath8 in ( [ sagnac2 ] ) suggested to some people@xcite an interpretation of the sagnac effect ( at least for matter waves ) as a sort of aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "this is definitely not the case .",
    "a relevant part of the discussion of the sagnac effect concerned the problem of the one- or two - ways velocity of light@xcite . using a closed circuit is in some sense a way to measure a `` one - way '' velocity of light and no doubt that naively dividing the length of the path by the time of flight measured by the observer two different results are obtained .",
    "this is however no problem :    \\a ) everything is perfectly consistent with sr and all the basic assumptions in it ( including the constancy of the speed of light for all inertial observers ) ;    \\b ) the observer knows that the difference in times is due to the relative motion with respect to the physical trail of light .",
    "some years ago selleri(see for instance@xcite ) , considering the problem of the speed of light on a rotating disk remarked that letting the radius of the disk go to infinity and the angular velocity to zero in such a way to leave the peripheral speed constant , one would smoothly pass from rotational to uniform translational motion .",
    "yet there would be a discontinuity in the speed of light forward and backward .",
    "here we have seen that the uniform motion of the observer together with a closed path for light rays does indeed produce different times of flight for light with no need for rotations and infinitely sized disks .",
    "selleri s gedanken experiment is in fact impossible , because the times of flight whose difference should remain constant , would become infinite , then unmeasurable .",
    "looking to fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] it is clear that it is indeed easy to measure ( and this is what wzyl have done ) a discontinuity in the times of flight backward and forward , without so challenging in any way the sr .",
    "of course if one measures a two - ways time of flight , i.e. light going back and forth along the same path , no discontinuity is found .",
    "we have shown that the result obtained by wzyl is indeed general and sheds a new light on the interpretation of the sagnac effect .",
    "actually this effect is due to the closeness of the path followed by light and to the relative motion of the observer with respect to the physical system obliging the beam to bend and come back to the observer .",
    "if this is correct the sagnac effect has nothing to do with rotations and accelerated motion , rather it is a peculiarity of relative motion relevant to the old debate about the one- or two - ways measurement of the speed of light ."
