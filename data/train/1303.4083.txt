    "a black hole can be characterized by its mass m , charge q and angular momentum j. a rotating charged black hole is represented by kerr - newman metric while uncharged one can be represented as kerr black hole . again , if a non - rotating black hole has charged then it is called reissner - nordstrm black hole . for uncharged case , the black hole which has only mass dependency",
    "is called schwarzschild black hole .",
    "+ recently , e. ay@xmath0n - beato and a. garcia @xcite ( abg ) gave a solution of the einstein field equations with nonlinear electrodynamics , known as abg black hole .",
    "the static spherical symmetric space - time is described by the metric @xmath1 where @xmath2 + with m and q corresponding to mass , electro - magnetic charge of the black hole respectively .",
    "+ this solution corresponds to a regular black hole with mass m and electro - magnetic charge q and avoids thus the singularity problem .",
    "also , the metric behaves asymptotically as the reissner - nordstrm ( rn)black hole solution .",
    "it is clear that the singularity of the rn solution , at r = 0 , has been omitted and now it simply becomes the origin of the spherical coordinates.several @xcite authors studied different types of black holes ( like charged brane - world black holes , dyadosphere of a charged black hole etc . ) .",
    "i. radinschi @xcite calculate the energy distribution of a charged abg black hole by using the energy - momentum complexes of einstein and mller .",
    "+ in this paper , we will analyze the behaviour of the timelike and null geodesics of charged e.ay@xmath0n-beato and a. garcia ( abg ) black hole . for circular and radial geodesics",

    "we also check the phenomenon of superradiance for an incident massless scalar field for such a black hole .",

    "+     for   @xmath38(taking e=1,j=10,q = m=1 ) ]    we can easily say that the behavior of these geodesics is independent on the mass and charge of the black hole .",
    "now , for circular geodesics , @xmath39 . the effective potential can be written as , @xmath40    if @xmath41 , the effective potential , @xmath42 is large enough and approaches to @xmath43 when @xmath44 . at the horizon , the effective potential , @xmath45 + we assume , the effective potential for @xmath46 [ in eqn.(17 )",
    ", put @xmath46 ] .",
    "the roots of the potential is nothing but the horizons for this case .",
    "it is nice to see the effective potential,@xmath48 is negative between the horizons .",
    "hence , the particle would be bounded within the horizons . again",
    ", a stable circular orbit will definitely exist between the horizons as @xmath34 has a minima there(fig.5 ) . +     ( for radial geodesic ) for massive particle(taking q = m=1 ) . ]",
    "the effective potential is given by @xmath49 where @xmath2 .",
    "+ the roots of @xmath50 are the horizons . for radial geodesic(j=0 ) , @xmath34 will vanish for some finite value of r in the region @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , it is not possible for timelike geodesic to reach the singularity .",
    "the massive particle will emerge in other region avoiding the singularity and the spacetime is geodesically complete .",
    "we can studied the motion for both @xmath37 and @xmath53 . in first case , if we take @xmath37 then @xmath34 becomes @xmath54 the roots of @xmath34 coincides with the horizons ( fig .",
    "6 ) the shape of the potential indicates that the particle can move only inside the black hole . if we investigate the behaviour of @xmath34 for @xmath55 , then when @xmath56 the effective potential becomes @xmath57 now , for large r,@xmath58 .",
    "for a two horizons black hole , with in the two ranges @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the function @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , in these two region , it is possible for @xmath34 to have roots .",
    "+ now consider for non - zero angular momentum(@xmath62 ) particle .",
    "roots of @xmath34 coincides with the two horizons and the shape of @xmath34 is shown in fig.6 .",
    "therefore , we can say that the massive particle with zero energy never escape from black hole and would be in a bound orbit .",
    "as the potential has a minima , the particle may have circular stable orbit . + again , for large r,@xmath58 when @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath56 then the effective potential becomes @xmath63 the same conclusion can be taken for this case also that @xmath34 have finite roots in between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "both the cases the massive particle would be in a bounded orbit .",
    "in this section we shall analyze the scalar wave equation for charged e. ay@xmath0n - beato and garcia black hole geometry following brill et al @xcite . the wave equation for a massless particle",
    "is given by @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is known from equation(1 ) . putting all the values one can obtain the following equation as @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "now , by using the separation of variable this equatin can be solved as @xmath68 substuting this we get @xmath69    now , the radial equation reduces to @xmath70    and the angular part reduces to @xmath71 now , if we substitute @xmath72 , the equation becomes @xmath73 if we now write @xmath74 where @xmath75 is an integer , then the equation @xmath76    is the familiar associated legendre equation and the solution is given by the associated legendre polynomial @xmath77 and is expressed as @xmath78      kerr - newman black hole allows energy extraction whereas schwarzschild black hole prohibits . by an explicit process , this can be achieved ( penrose process ) .",
    "superradiance is nothing but the wave analogy of the penrose process on black hole.when a bosonic or fermionic wave is incident on a black hole , naturally the reflected wave carries less energy than the incident one .",
    "but under specific condition , the transmitted wave , absorbed by the black hole carries negative energy into the black hole which makes the reflection coefficient greater than unity .",
    "this phenomena is called superradiance@xcite.according to this process the energy can be extracted from the black hole at the cost of lossing its angular momentum.the requirred condition is + @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the angular velocity of the horizon @xcite .",
    "basak et al discussed this phenomenon for the acoustic analogue of the kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "shiraishi @xcite and ali @xcite argued that superradiance phenomenon is possible if the black hole is rotating or charged.now , we check whether the superradiance phenomenon really happens for e. ay@xmath0n - beato and garcia(abg ) black hole .",
    "+ the radial equation can be written as @xmath81    now , we introduce the familiar tortoise coordinate,@xmath82 defined as @xmath83 that implies @xmath84    it is to be mentioned here that the variable @xmath82 is constructed in the same way as in schwarzschild or in kerr metric .",
    "therefore , in this case the variable is non - integrable .",
    "though the basic purpose is still satisfied , the coordinate spans over the real line and pushes the horizon to -@xmath85 .",
    "+ again , we introduce another function @xmath86 which reduces the radial equation in a more familiar form @xmath87 u = 0 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therfore , a potential barrier remains where    @xmath88\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at horizon ( @xmath89 ) , the radial equation comes out to be @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "now , asymptotically , @xmath92 , imlies that @xmath93 .",
    "the equation has the same form as in the previous case @xmath94    thus @xmath95 , where @xmath96 represents the radial solution at horizon and @xmath97 is the solution at @xmath85 .",
    "this equality shows that for a e. ay@xmath0n - beato and garcia ( abg ) black hole there is _ no phenomenon of superradiance for an incident massless scalar field_.",
    "in this investigation , we have analyzed the behavior of the timelike and null geodesics of charged e. ay@xmath0n - beato and garcia(abg ) black hole . here , we shown the behaviour of time - distance and proper time - distance graph.in case of radial geodesic , the effective potential is independent of the charge and mass of the black hole , for photonlike particle . however , from the shape of the potential , it is clear that the timelike particle can move only inside the black hole . on the other hand , for circular geodesics ,",
    "the roots of the effective potential coincide with the horizon . also , from fig . 5",
    ", we can say that as the potential has a minima between the horizons , the photonlike as well as timelike particles would be bounded in a stable circular orbit .",
    "+ though it is familiar that the superradiance phenomenon could be seen in charged or rotating black holes@xcite , we have found that it is absent in the charged e. ay@xmath0n - beato and garcia ( abg ) black hole .",
