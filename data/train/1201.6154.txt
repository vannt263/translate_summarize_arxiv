    "babio@xmath0 is a parent compound for high-@xmath7 superconductors ba@xmath8k@xmath9bio@xmath0 and ba@xmath8pb@xmath9bio@xmath0",
    ". properties of these compounds are the most intriguing when chemical composition is near transition to sc state",
    ". it would be promising to describe softening of phonon modes with doping as a result of _ ab initio _ calculation in order to support phonon mechanism for superconductivity in these materials .",
    "the proper description of electronic and crystal structure of pure babio@xmath0 has serious difficulties within density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to take into account strong electronic correlations that are important in high-@xmath7 cuprates and oxipnictides .",
    "however , the most straightforward way to include correlation effects : the lda+u method fails in attempts to improve results of the dft calculation for babio@xmath0 . in the present work it is shown that the reason for this failure is a high oxidation state of the compound .",
    "a conventional basis set used in the lda+u method is pure atomic orbitals , that is usually a good approximation for @xmath6-bands wannier functions in transition metal compounds ( with important exception of high oxidation state materials ) . for babio@xmath0 one should use genuine wannier functions as a basis set for the lda+u correction potential , because they differ a lot from pure atomic bi @xmath2-orbitals .",
    "below it is demonstrated that the lda+u correction in wannier function basis results in a strong improvement of the calculated parameters for crystal structure and spectral properties for babio@xmath0 .",
    "the lda+u  @xcite and lda+dmft  @xcite methods for the electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated systems are designed as a combination of dft and model hamiltonian approach ( such as hubbard or anderson models ) .",
    "a dft potential is defined by electronic density only and hence is invariant under unitary transformation of auxiliary kohn - sham orbitals ( dft knows nothing about basis functions of a particular method ; dft knows only kohn - sham orbitals and total charge density ) .",
    "however , in model hamiltonians coulomb interaction between electrons is explicitly defined for localized states having symmetry of atomic orbitals .",
    "a specific form of these orbitals remains to be determined in a calculation scheme developed for lda+u method realization .",
    "for the lmto  @xcite method , the basis set ( muffin - tin orbitals ) is explicitly constructed in the form of atomic - like orbitals and so in this case the choice of orbitals for coulomb interaction term is obvious .",
    "for the lapw@xcite method , there are atomic symmetry wave functions inside muffin - tin spheres and there are pseudoatomic orbitals even for pseudopotential methods . these orbitals are usually used to define the coulomb interaction term in a lda+u calculation scheme based on corresponding methods .    the most general and `` rigorous '' way to define atomic - like orbitals in solid is to build wannier functions .",
    "that is done via fourier transformation from delocalized bloch functions @xmath10 in reciprocal space of wave vectors @xmath11 to functions @xmath12 in direct space lattice sites vectors @xmath13 .",
    "both sets , the bloch functions @xmath10 and wannier functions @xmath12 , generate the same wave functions hilbert space and can be considered as different basis sets for this space .",
    "correlation effects are usually strong enough to be taken into account for transition metal compounds , where @xmath6- or @xmath14-states produce narrow energy bands .",
    "fourier transformation for corresponding bloch functions results in wannier functions , which are well localized inside an atomic sphere and hence using atomic @xmath6- or @xmath14-orbitals instead of them is a good approximation .",
    "correlated states differ substantially from pure atomic @xmath6-orbitals in compounds with elements in high oxidation state , for example , cafeo@xmath0 , aute@xmath15 , and babio@xmath0 .",
    "narrow energy bands near the fermi level have a serious admixture of @xmath16-states in such compounds , which could be even larger in value than @xmath6-states contribution .",
    "moreover , an energy gap could be formed predominantly by @xmath16-states with a slight admixture of @xmath6-states ( as it happens in aute@xmath15 )  @xcite .",
    "the mixed nature of correlated electronic states does not allow to use traditional implementations of the lda+u method with pure atomic orbitals as a basis set for coulomb interaction term .",
    "explicit wannier functions basis set for correlated states should be chosen to perform electronic structure calculations for these materials .",
    "many researchers used wannier function basis for strongly correlated materials calculations in recent years , for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we investigate babio@xmath0 where wannier functions basis in contrast to atomic orbitals is crucial for proper crystal structure description . in the case of babio@xmath0",
    "partially filled band , which is a source of correlation effects , is formed by bi @xmath2-states and oxygen @xmath17-states .",
    "the energy of original bi @xmath2-level is below oxygen band but strong hybridization between them results in the splitting of the partially filled band upward from the @xmath17-states manifold .",
    "the contribution of oxygen states to this band is stronger then contents of bi @xmath2-states but corresponding wave function still has @xmath18-symmetry in respect to bi site .",
    "wannier function constructed from this band has the same symmetry but it is spatially distributed more on oxygen sites than on bi ion .",
    "accounting for the coulomb interaction on such a wannier functions basis leads to the results very different from the lda+u calculations using pure bi @xmath2-orbitals .",
    "wannier functions ( wfs ) @xmath19 are defined as fourier transforms of the bloch functions @xmath20 : @xmath21 is the lattice translation vector , @xmath22 is the band number , and @xmath23 is the wave vector .",
    "wfs seem to be an optimal choice to describe correlated states because these functions are localized , site - centered and represent a complete basis set for the bloch functions hilbert space . in the present paper wfs were generated as projections of bloch sums of the atomic orbitals @xmath24 onto a subspace of the bloch functions ( the detailed description of wfs construction procedure within pseudopotential method is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath25 @xmath26 and describe electronic states that form energy bands numbered from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . to describe coulomb repulsion between occupied and empty states one needs to compute occupation numbers of wfs .",
    "the wannier functions occupancy matrix @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the step function , @xmath32 is the one - electron energy for the state @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the fermi energy .",
    "one of the most general and accurate approaches to describe the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems is the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite .",
    "the method combining _ ab initio _",
    "dft approach and model dmft calculations  lda+dmft was applied recently to the quantitative description of both electronic and crystal structure of several compounds with strong electronic correlations  @xcite .",
    "the lda+dmft method is successful and promising but it demands a lot of computational resources . in the present paper the static limit of dynamical mean - field theory ",
    "the lda+u method is used .",
    "there is an additional term in hamiltonian operator to take into account coulomb correlations .",
    "if one considers on - site interaction only and takes into account the diagonal form of the occupation matrix @xmath29 , the additional term is written in wfs basis as @xmath35 where @xmath36  the occupation number for _ m_-th wf . in the case of",
    "babio@xmath0 the non - diagonal terms of @xmath29 are equal to zero by construction ( we have strictly orthogonal wfs of bi - s - orbital symmetry ) . for more complex basis sets",
    "it could be necessary to use rotationally invariant potential correction and take into account non - diagonal terms .",
    "the full hamiltonian operator is written as @xmath37 where @xmath38  the hamiltonian operator within lda ( or gga ) approximation .",
    "the form of the correction potential ( [ wannieru ] ) results in a negative addition to potential @xmath39 for occupied states @xmath40 and in a positive value @xmath41 for empty states @xmath42 .",
    "hence the lda+u correction to dft will increase energy separation between bands below and above the fermi level increasing energy gap values and enhancing total energy gain of the distortion that causes the gap appearance .",
    "the value of coulomb interaction parameter @xmath43 is computed via constrained lda calculation as described in  @xcite .",
    "the total energy is computed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total energy from a standard dft calculation ( lda or gga could be used , we preferred gga ) , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the double counting correction , and @xmath48 is the total occupancy of wfs .",
    "undoped babio@xmath0 has a monoclinic crystal structure ( symmetry group is c2/m ) .",
