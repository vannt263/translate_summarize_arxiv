    "determination of the equation of state of neutron stars has been an important goal of nuclear physics for more than two decades .",
    "progress toward this goal can be made by establishing astrophysical constraints as well as by improving our understanding of nuclear forces .",
    "the discovery using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ of highly coherent kilohertz qpos in the persistent emission of some sixteen neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( see [ 1 ] ) is likely to provide important new constraints . in both the sonic - point",
    "[ 2 ] and magnetospheric [ 3 ] beat - frequency interpretations , the highest frequencies observed are the orbital frequency at the inner edge of the keplerian disk flow ( see [ 4 ] ) .",
    "such high orbital frequencies yield interesting bounds on the masses and radii of these neutron stars and interesting constraints on the equation of state of neutron star matter . here",
    "we describe how bounds on masses and radii can be derived from the properties of the kilohertz qpos and how these bounds are affected by stellar rotation .",
    "we also discuss detection of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is the highest keplerian frequency observed from a given neutron star and that the star is not rotating ( we use a superscript zero to indicate relations that are valid only for a nonrotating star ) .",
    "the radius of the star must be smaller than the radius @xmath1 of the gas with orbital frequency @xmath0 , so the representative point of the star in the @xmath2,@xmath3 plane must lie to the left of the curve @xmath4 that relates @xmath1 , @xmath5 , and the mass of the star .",
    "in addition , in order to produce a wave train with tens of oscillations , the gas producing the qpo must be outside the radius @xmath6 of the marginally stable orbit ( isco ) , so the representative point must also lie below the intersection of @xmath7 with the curve @xmath8 that relates @xmath6 and the mass of the star .",

    "the spin of the star affects both the structure of the star and the spacetime , altering the stellar mass - radius relation , the frequency of an orbit of given radius , and the value of @xmath11 for a given stellar mass .",
    "the parameter that characterizes the importance of these effects is the dimensionless quantity , where @xmath12 and @xmath3 are the angular momentum and gravitational mass of the star . for the spin frequencies @xmath13\\c\\else\\if'\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\else\\if\\empty\\c\\else\\if\\space\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\fi}}}$ ] inferred in the kilohertz qpo sources , @xmath14 .",

    "our calculations [ 2 ] show that _ the mass of the neutron star in must be less than @xmath19 and its radius must be less than @xmath20  km_. as just explained , the precise upper bounds depend on the equation of state assumed .",
    "for further details , see [ 2 ] .",
    "if the stellar spin frequency is @xmath21\\c\\else\\if'\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\else\\if\\empty\\c\\else\\if\\space\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\fi}}}$ ] or higher , spin affects the structure of the star as well as the exterior spacetime , which then differs substantially from the kerr spacetime and must be computed numerically for each assumed equation of state .",
    "we have carried out such computations and find [ 6 ] that if the neutron star is spinning rapidly , the constraints on the equation of state are dramatically tightened .",
    "establishing that an observed qpo frequency is the frequency of the isco would be an important step forward in our understanding of strong - field gravity and the properties of dense matter , because it would confirm one of the key predictions of general relativity in the strong - field regime and fix the mass of the neutron star in that source , for each assumed equation of state . given the fundamental significance of the isco , it is very important to establish what would constitute strong , rather than merely suggestive , evidence that an isco has been detected ( for a detailed discussion of various signatures , see [ 2 ] ) .",
    "probably the most convincing signature would be a fairly coherent , kilohertz qpo with a frequency that reproducibly increases steeply with increasing accretion rate but then becomes constant and remains nearly constant as the accretion rate increases further ( see fig .",
    ". the constant frequency should always be the same in a given source .",
    "it has been suggested that the similarity of the highest qpo frequencies seen so far indicates that iscos are being detected [ 7 ] and that the roughly constant frequencies of the 800900  hz qpos seen in [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] during the first observations of these sources with the _ rossi explorer _ were generated by the beat of the spin frequency against the frequency of iscos in these sources [ 10 ] .",
    "this would imply that the neutron stars in all the kilohertz qpo sources have masses close to @xmath22 .",
    "however , _ no strong signatures of the innermost stable circular orbit have so far been seen in any of these sources_. indeed , more recent observations of both [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] are inconsistent with the suggestion that the qpo frequencies seen initially are related to the frequencies of iscos in these sources .",
    "nevertheless , the prospects appear excellent for discovering clear evidence of an isco in one or more of the kilohertz qpo sources in the future ."
