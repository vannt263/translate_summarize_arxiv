    "multiresolution analysis of deterministic signals by the use of wavelets has been extensively studied in recent years . however , in the context of stochastic processes , general wavelet approximations has not yet been fully investigated . in the majority of cases developed deterministic methods and used error measures and metrics may not be appropriate to investigate wavelet representations of stochastic processes .",
