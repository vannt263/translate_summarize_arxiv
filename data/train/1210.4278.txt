    "surface growth phenomena have attracted much attention in both science and technology , which involve fundamental understanding of the roughness of the surface and applications to the design of new materials .",
    "being typical nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena , they have been one of the main topics in nonequilibrium statistical physics . in 1986 ,",
    "kardar , parisi and zhang proposed a prototypical equation which describes surface growth with local interaction  @xcite .",
    "its one - dimensional version reads @xmath0 here @xmath1 represents the height of the surface at position @xmath2 and time @xmath3 .",
    "the first term represents the effect of nonlinearity and the second one describes the smoothing effect of the surface .",
    "@xmath4 represents randomness described by the gaussian white noise with covariance , @xmath5 the parameters @xmath6 determine their strengths .",
    "an important feature of the kpz equation is that it can describe self - affine properties of the height fluctuation . in one - dimensional case",
    ", it has been shown by the renormalization techniques that the height fluctuation grows like @xmath7 as @xmath8 goes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "this _ growth exponent _ @xmath9 appear also in many models of surface growth and characterizes the kpz universality class  @xcite .    our understanding of the kpz universality class has progressed by finding mathematical connection between the probability distribution of the height and the random matrix theory .",
    "the first breakthrough was brought not in the kpz equation but in solvable discrete models belonging to the kpz universality class such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) and the polynuclear growth ( png ) model . in  @xcite",
    ", the author obtained the exact solution of the current distribution for the tasep with the step initial configuration , which corresponds to the height distribution for the curved growth in the language of growth process .",
    "it turned out that it converges in the long time limit to the largest eigenvalue distribution of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) in the random matrix theory .",
    "this distribution is called the gue tracy - widom distribution  @xcite . the result in  @xcite has been generalized to the case of the other initial configurations  @xcite and it has been found that the current distributions depend on the initial conditions even if they have the common scaling exponents @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in the case of the alternating initial condition for tasep , which corresponds to the flat initial configuration in a growth process , the limiting current distribution converges to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) tracy - widom distribution , which is the largest eigenvalue distribution of the other random matrix ensemble called the goe  @xcite .",
    "since then , the studies on the height distributions have been the subject of active investigation  @xcite .    during the last few years",
    ", the studies on the kpz equation and kpz universality have entered a new stage  @xcite .",
    "first , an experiment using the liquid crystal turbulence were performed in  @xcite .",
    "the authors succeeded in obtaining not only the exponent @xmath9 but also the gue / goe tracy - widom distributions as well as their finite - time corrections .",
    "second , there has been much progress on the theoretical study : an exact height distribution for the kpz equation has been found in @xcite .",
    "this first exact solution was obtained for the narrow wedge initial condition , from which the surface grows in parabolic shape .",
    "the analysis was based on the result of the current distribution of the asep in  @xcite and the fact that the kpz equation is obtained as a weakly asymmetric limit of the asep  @xcite .",
    "afterwards the same technique was applied to the case of the half brownian motion initial condition  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this solution is that this distribution describes the universal crossover between the edwards - wilkinson  @xcite and the kpz universality classes .",
    "as @xmath10 , the growth exponent becomes @xmath11 and the distribution converges to the gaussian , which implies that the nonlinearity in the kpz equation does not become effective and thus the system belongs to the edwards - wilkinson universality class . as @xmath12 , on the other hand , the exponent becomes @xmath9 and the distribution converges to the gue tracy - widom distribution .",
    "furthermore it turned out that this crossover is universal for weakly driven growth  @xcite .",
    "as explained above , these achievements in the kpz equation provide us not only exact information but also the important physical findings .",
    "thus it is of great importance to develop the exact approach in such a way that it can be applied to other interesting situations .",
    "in particular , a most challenging problem would be an application of the exact solution to the analysis on the space - time correlation in the case of the stationary situation , which is the main subject of this paper . for this purpose",
    ", the replica method is suitable .",
    "the replica method has been established as a powerful tool for disordered systems in statistical mechanics .",
    "the application to the kpz equation was first proposed in  @xcite and refined in  @xcite .",
    "it utilizes a connection between the @xmath13th moment of the exponential height ( @xmath13 replica partition function ) and the dynamics of one - dimensional @xmath13 particle bose gas system with attractive interaction which can be solved by the bethe ansatz  @xcite . using the exact knowledge to the @xmath13 replica partition function obtained by the bethe ansatz technique , we analyze the generating function of the @xmath13 replica partition function .",
    "although it is in fact a divergent sum , a resummation technique developed in  @xcite allows us to find fredholm determinant representation of the generating function from which the exact height distribution is readily obtained .",
    "the method is so powerful that not merely the same expression was rederived for the narrow wedge initial condition  @xcite , but one can generalize it to the case of other initial conditions , such as the flat  @xcite and half - brownian motion  @xcite initial condition .",
    "the multi - point distributions have also been studied  @xcite though it includes a decoupling assumption .",
    "furthermore the idea of finding the fredholm determinant structure of moment generating function has become the basis of the study on the macdonald process  @xcite , which is a larger class of integrable stochastic process including the kpz equation , a directed polymer model  @xcite , etc .",
    "and deals with the rigorous version of the replica analysis . for more recent developments , see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the stationary situation of the kpz equation by the replica method .",
    "it is known that the stationary state is given by the brownian motion ( bm )  @xcite with respect to the position ( @xmath14 ) axis i.e. , the stationary state is realized when we prepare the initial height difference @xmath15 as the two - sided brownian motion .",
    "since the system is translational invariant , one can set without loss of generality the initial height a the origin to be zero , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "then the initial condition considered in this paper is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two independent standard bms with expectation @xmath20=0 $ ] and covariance @xmath21 = \\text{min}\\{x , y\\}$ ] .",
    "for this initial condition we consider the height distribution function @xmath22 and obtain its explicit expression in terms of the fredholm determinant . from this expression",
    ", we also obtain the stationary two point correlation function , @xmath23 which is one of the most fundamental quantities which detects the space - time correlation in statistical mechanical systems .",
    "note that   describes the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath24 although @xmath24 does not appear in this expression since we set @xmath16 as explained above .",
    "we also show that in the long - time limit , scaled forms of these functions   and   converge to the ones obtained in  @xcite and  @xcite respectively .",
    "a part of these result in this paper was already reported in  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide complete descriptions of our results including their derivations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mmr ] , we will give precise definitions of the quantities discussed in this paper and our results . in sec .",
    "[ ra ] , the details of the replica analysis will be explained . in sec .",
    "[ gfhd ] , we will obtain the exact solution for the generating function of the replica partition function and the height distribution function for the two - sided brownian motion initial condition with drifts . by taking the zero drift limit , our final goal ,",
    "the height distribution for the stationary state , is accomplished , which will be explained in sec .",
    "the long - time limit will be taken in sec .",
    "the last section will be devoted to the conclusion .",
    "one of the goals in this paper is to obtain an exact expression for the distribution of the height   with the two - sided brownian motion initial condition  . for this purpose , it is convenient as a first step to consider a slightly more generalized initial condition where we add the drift terms to  , @xmath25 where @xmath26 indicate the strengths of the drifts .",
    "[ twosidedbm ] depicts this generalized initial condition  . at first we set the drifts to be positive so that one can take an average over the brownian motion initial condition ( see   below ) .",
    "afterwards , the condition for the drifts will be relaxed gradually as our analysis goes on ( see   and  ) . in sec .",
    "[ sl ] , we finally take the limit @xmath27 which corresponds to the stationary situation .",
    "two - sided brownian motion initial condition with drifts @xmath26 ]    the macroscopic shape of the height @xmath1 for large @xmath8 is obtained by solving   where only the nonlinear term is taken into account and other terms ( the diffusion and noise terms ) are ignored . for the initial condition  , it becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 is given below .",
    "we are interested in the fluctuation property near the origin @xmath30 around this macroscopic profile . from the kpz scaling",
    ", one expects that the fluctuation of the height scales like @xmath31 and nontrivial correlations are seen in the @xmath14 direction with scale @xmath32 when @xmath8 is large .",
    "let us define a parameter @xmath33 which scales as @xmath31 and a rescaled space coordinate @xmath34 by @xmath35 we can introduce the scaled height @xmath36 by @xmath37 here the term @xmath38 in rhs comes from the parabolic profile ( the middle equation ) in  .",
    "let us define the probability distribution of @xmath36 , @xmath39 in order to get an exact expression for this quantity , we now introduce the generalized height @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 where the initial height of the overall surface @xmath42 is set to be a random variable such that @xmath43 obeys the inverse gamma distribution with parameter @xmath44 , i.e. the probability density function of @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 although this definition   may look artificial , we will find that it has more tractable mathematical structure compared with @xmath1 itself ( see proposition 1 below and sec .  [ shifting ] ) .",
    "we also define the probability distribution @xmath47 in a similar way to   @xmath48    our result for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are summarized as follows .",

    "_    we obtained this result by the replica method .",
    "the details of this approach and the derivation of proposition 1 will be explained in secs .",
    "[ ra ] and  [ gfhd ] . in",
    ", the factor @xmath63 comes from the laplace transform of the pdf of @xmath43 and is defined by the taylor expansion .",
    "this equation represents the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which will be discussed particularly in sec .",
    "[ shifting ] .",
    "note that the distribution function   is expressed as the convolution of the gumbel distribution and the fredholm determinants .",
    "such a mathematical structure is common to the cases of the narrow wedge initial condition i.e. @xmath64  @xcite and the half brownian motion initial condition , i.e. @xmath65 is bm for @xmath66 while the narrow wedge for @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "( this is the reason why we introduce the generalized height  . ) moreover , can be regarded as a generalization of the probability distributions for the narrow wedge and half - bm initial conditions : noticing the relations @xmath68 where @xmath69 we easily find the function   becomes that for the narrow wedge case as both @xmath70 and @xmath71 go to infinity and that for the half brownian motion case as @xmath71 ( @xmath70 ) goes to infinity ( 0 ) .      here",
    "we consider the stationary limit where both drifts @xmath26 in   go to 0 .",
    "when we take this limit for the expression  , we notice that the gamma function factor @xmath72 in   becomes divergent while the factor @xmath73 vanishes since the term @xmath42 in   diverges .",
    "thus we have to analyze carefully the limiting behavior of each factor , which will be discussed in sec .  [ sl ] .",
    "we obtain the following result : let us introduce the scaled drifts @xmath74 and consider the quantity @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 note that the situation @xmath77 corresponds to the case of flat macroscopic profile ( see fig .",
    "[ twosidedbm ] and  ) and the parameter @xmath78 determines the slope of the surface .",

    "the expression in theorem 2 is suitable for numerical evaluations of the distribution function .",
    "by contrast proposition 1 is not because we need precise estimations for both the divergence of the gamma function factor and the convergence of the factor @xmath47 to zero in the stationary limit .",
    "[ density123 ] shows the pictures of the probability density function for @xmath98 .",
    "these are obtained by discretizing simply the fredholm determinants in   and  , which is sufficient for our purpose of getting those pictures .",
    "a more elaborate approximation technique for a fredholm determinant has been developed recently in  @xcite .",
    "for accurate estimations of statistical quantities of our height distributions , this technique would be useful .",
    "the distribution function obtained in this paper appears not merely in the kpz equation but also in some time regime in various stochastic models  @xcite .",
    "one typical example is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "the asep is a stochastic many - particle system where each particle hops to the right ( left ) neighboring site with rate @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) but it can not hop to the occupied sites , which leads to the exclusion effect .",

    "this relation indicates that the height of the kpz equation well approximates the current in the asep with the asymmetry @xmath111 being small , which is called the weakly asep ( wasep ) .",

    "3 .   in  lhs of",
    ", the new gamma function factor appears in addition to the factor @xmath497 , which is the origin of the divergence of the generating function in the case of narrow wedge initial data .",
    "however from the asymptotic property of the gamma function , we easily find the gamma function factor does not cause a singular behavior especially for large @xmath250 .",
    "thus the divergence of the generating function comes only from the factor @xmath497 , which is the same situation as the narrow wedge initial data .",
    "moreover as explained in  , lemma 6(a ) , which plays a crucial role in the replica analysis , is a natural extension of the cases for the narrow wedge and half bm initial data .    to understand the regularization procedure in the replica analysis",
