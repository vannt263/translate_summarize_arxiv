    "numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on lattice at finite temperature and density predict that at high temperature and/or energy density hadrons melt down to a new state of matter , called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) which might have existed after a few microseconds of the big bang .",
    "lattice qcd based calculations @xcite indicate that the phase transition from a hadronic state to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons occurs beyond a critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) and a critical baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the order of the qcd phase transition and the properties of the qgp state have been a matter of intense debate , lately . according to the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations ,",
    "the order of the phase transition depends on the quark masses and more importantly , on the baryochemical potential ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these calculations suggest that the qcd phase diagram has a point in temperature - baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) plane where the first order phase transition ends .",
    "the exact location of this point in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath5 is not known yet , but the lqcd calculations suggest that it might be within the reach of heavy - ion experiments . since the magnitude of the baryochemical potential at the central rapidity region depends on the collision energy ( it reduces with the increase in beam energy ) , by scanning over a broad energy range , it would be possible to study the change in the nature of qcd phase transition along the phase boundary and probe the critical point .",
    "a combination of several observables is required in order to study the quark - hadron phase boundary and to locate the qcd critical point . in this article",
    ", we point out that @xmath0 meson may be used as a sensitive probe for studying the phase boundary .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is the lightest bound state of hidden strangeness ( @xmath8 ) , and is produced early in the reaction .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is least suffered by hadronic re - scattering",
    ". relatively long lifetime ( @xmath9 fm / c ) of @xmath0 mesons may ensure that the decay products are least affected by re - scattering with other hadrons as the decay occurs outside the fireball  @xcite . on one hand , the theoretical calculations  @xcite show different amount of modification of the @xmath0 meson properties in the medium due to its interaction with other mesons in the thermal bath . on the other hand ,",
    "the results extracted from the analysis of the experimental data on the ratio of various hadronic species  @xcite indicate that the ( inelastic ) interactions of @xmath0 with other hadrons is not significant for temperatures below @xmath3 . in view of the other systematic effects entering to the measurements of the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath0 ,",
    "the change in the properties of @xmath0 in the hadronic phase  @xcite may not be significant enough to alter the results of the present analysis .",
    "the kinematic observables and flow phenomena of the @xmath0 mesons are particularly interesting for asserting the equation of state and the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the initial energy density plays a very crucial role in the evolution of the fireball which is estimated as follows .",
    "the volume of a cylinder of radius @xmath10 and length @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , is the proper time and @xmath14 , is the space - time rapidity .",
    "identifying @xmath15 with the kinematic rapidity , @xmath16 and considering the volume element of width @xmath17 in rapidity space around mid - rapidity ( @xmath18 ) at the initial time , @xmath19 one gets the value of the initial volume as @xmath20 .",
    "if the total initial energy within the rapidity window @xmath17 is @xmath21 then the initial energy density @xmath22 , as was first discussed in a seminal paper by bjorken @xcite is given by , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of hadrons per unit rapidity and @xmath25 is the mean transverse mass . in the absence of detailed hydrodynamic calculations ,",
    "this expression has been widely used by various experiments @xcite to estimate the initial energy density . however , the bjorken energy density given by eqn .",
    "1 could be much smaller than the actual initial energy density produced in nuclear collisions .",
    "the estimated energy density in the framework of bjorken model may be taken as a lower bound @xcite due to strong reduction , when compared with the initially produced energy density from longitudinal hydrodynamic work during the expansion .    in a first order phase transition scenario ,",
    "the pressure increases with temperature until the transition temperature @xmath3 is reached , then it remains constant during the mixed phase , and continues to increase after the end of the mixed phase . in a similar fashion",
    ", the deconfinement transition can be studied by observing the variation of average transverse momentum ( @xmath26 ) of hadrons as a function of the hadron multiplicity at mid - rapidity ( @xmath24 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 is expected to reflect the average temperature @xmath27 and a flow component which can be related to the initial pressure .",
    "similarly the hadronic multiplicity reflects the entropy density of the system .",
    "while the purely thermal component of @xmath26 can not be related to the initial temperature which remains immeasurable directly above @xmath3 , however the flow component in the inverse slope can reflect the plateau of the pressure during mixed phase .",
    "it has been observed that in central heavy ion collisions , the @xmath28 of pions , kaons and protons as a function of @xmath29 shows a step - like behavior as predicted in  @xcite for a wide range of collision energies @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations assuming a first order transition could reproduce these data @xcite . here , we have made an attempt to make the study for @xmath0-mesons which could provide a better understanding of the qcd phase boundary , because of the nature of the interaction of @xmath0 with hadronic matter .    the transverse momentum ( @xmath30 spectra of @xmath0-mesons measured for ags @xcite , sps @xcite and rhic @xcite energies have been analyzed in order to obtain the inverse slope parameter , @xmath31 .",
    "this effective temperature has contributions from both the ( random ) thermal and the collective motions in the transverse direction .",
    "it is well known that the inverse slope ( @xmath31 ) of the transverse momentum spectra of a hadron of mass @xmath32 can be related to the ` true ' freeze - out temperature ( @xmath33 ) and average radial flow velocity ( @xmath34 ) at the decoupling surface as : @xmath35 the transverse flow extracted from the @xmath36 spectra of @xmath0 meson is particularly useful because of its small re - scattering cross - section with hadrons , the @xmath0 meson is expected to obtain most of its collective flow from the partonic phase which is produced in the early stages of heavy - ion collisions .    because of long lifetime of @xmath0-meson it can probe the reaction time scales in a definite fashion .",
    "the @xmath36 spectra of @xmath0-mesons may reveal quite a few information about the evolution of the system .",
    "these can be obtained by making a blast wave ( bw ) model description  @xcite of the experimental spectra .",
    "for this purpose , we have chosen data corresponding to only central collisions of or at different energies .",
    "although the bw parametrization of the @xmath37 spectra could give a set of values for @xmath38 and @xmath34 , we have taken the best possible values ( with reduced @xmath39 ) for our present studies .",
    "the results of the bw fit have been shown in fig .",
    "[ blastwave ] and the extracted values of @xmath34 and @xmath40 are listed in table  i. the table also enlists @xmath38 and other basic parameters of different colliding systems at different collision energies .",
    "the similarity of the extracted @xmath33 to the critical temperature @xmath41 predicted by lattice calculations  @xcite imply that the @xmath0 meson freezes out near the phase boundary and could be used to extract the properties of qcd matter near the transition point .",
    "moreover the large values of @xmath42 at rhic energies indicate that qgp has undergone substantial radial flow .",

    "so it is imperative to study the variation of temperature with energy density or center of mass energy for a fixed collision centrality .",

    "figure [ withedensity ] shows @xmath47 ( top ) and @xmath48 ( bottom ) of @xmath0-mesons as functions of @xmath49 . in both the figures ( [ withcom ] and [ withedensity ] ) , the inverse slope parameter of the @xmath52-spectra , @xmath47 , shows an increase with collision energy / energy density till lower sps energy is reached .",
    "a further increase in collision energy leads to an increase of early temperature and pressure of the system . as a consequence the transverse momenta of the produced hadrons and",
    "hence the inverse slope parameters increase with collision energy .",
    "this is followed by the region of constant temperature which corresponds to higher sps energies , where it is expected that the system undergoes a deconfinement transition with the creation of a co - existing phase of partons and hadrons , which is signaled by a plateau - like structure in the above spectrum .",
    "the resulting modification of equation of state ( eos ) suppresses the transverse expansion .",
    "this observation of a plateau - like structure is equivalent to a liquid - gas phase transition with involvement of latent heat of the system , characteristic of a first order phase transition .",
    "thus the experimental data indicate a first order phase transition , with a mixed phase stretching energy density between @xmath53 and @xmath54gev/@xmath55 . at higher energies ( corresponding to rhic energies ) ,",
    "@xmath47 further increases with collision energy .",
    "the eos at the early stage becomes stiff again leading to increase in early pressure and temperature .",
    "the thermal component , @xmath48 , also shows a plateau like behavior in going toward the rhic energies .",
    "the extraction of @xmath48 involves the flow component , @xmath42 , which has an added significance . as a function of collision energy",
    ", @xmath42 shows similar behavior as @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "a similar pattern is suggested for the elliptic flow as a function of collision energy  @xcite .",
    "the observation of a mixed phase goes in line with the fact that excitation function of various observables show anomalous behavior or saturation effects starting at lower sps energies @xcite .",
    "this could be related to the onset of deconfinement corresponding to sps energy regime .",
    "in addition , the fact that microscopic transport models , based on hadronic degrees of freedom failed to reproduce the observed behavior of kaon inverse slope @xcite , also indicated the creation of a deconfinement transition corresponding to this energy regime .",
    "it has also been observed that the inverse slope parameter in @xmath56 interactions increases smoothly with collision energy with the absence of any plateau - like structure which signify a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "an interesting review on onset of deconfinement in nucleus - nucleus collisions has recently been done by gazdzicki _",
    "in summary , we observe the anomalous energy ( density ) dependence of transverse mass spectra of @xmath0-mesons produced in central heavy ion collisions .",
    "the inverse slope of the @xmath37 spectrum shows an increase in ags and rhic energy regime , whereas it is almost constant in the intermediate sps energies .",
    "this observation goes in line with the previous observations for lighter mesons .",
    "this anomaly could be caused by the modification of the equation of state in the transition region of the qcd deconfinement transition .",
    "the present analysis also indicates a first order phase transition stretching over an energy density of @xmath57 gev/@xmath55 , which agrees with the lqcd prediction for the critical energy density ( @xmath58 gev/@xmath55 ) for deconfinement .",
    "this observation is very exciting in view of the observed anomalies in the excitation functions of other observables , namely strangeness production , in view of the onset of deconfinement in the sps energy domain .",
    "it would have been equally interesting to make a similar study on the spectra of @xmath59 hyperons , as it is sensitive to the matter equation of state at the early stages of collisions . however , at present , enough data are not available for the @xmath59 hyperons to make a similar study . the ongoing rhic beam energy scan and the same at sps will certainly help in getting a clear picture to this problem , with the advent of new data sets in the intermediate energy regime . + * acknowledgments :* we thank drs .",
