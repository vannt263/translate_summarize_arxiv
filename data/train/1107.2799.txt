    "it is well known that some liquids ( for example , water , silica , silicon , carbon , phosphorus , and some biological systems ) show an anomalous behavior in the vicinity of their freezing lines @xcite .",
    "the water phase diagrams have regions where a thermal expansion coefficient is negative ( density anomaly ) , self - diffusivity increases upon compression ( diffusion anomaly ) , and the structural order of the system decreases with increasing pressure ( structural anomaly ) @xcite .",
    "the first anomaly mentioned above is density anomaly .",
    "it means that density increases upon heating or that the thermal expansion coefficient becomes negative . using the thermodynamic relation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a thermal expansion coefficient and @xmath3 is the isothermal compressibility and taking into account that @xmath3 is always positive and finite for systems in equilibrium not at a critical point",
    ", we conclude that density anomaly corresponds to minimum of the pressure dependence on temperature along an isochor .",
    "this is the most convenient indicator of density anomaly in computer simulation .",
    "if we consider a simple liquid ( for , example , lennard - jones liquid ) , and trace the diffusion along an isotherm we find that the diffusion decreases under densification .",
    "this observation is intuitively clear - if density increases the free volume decreases and the particles have less freedom to move .",
    "however , some substances have a region in density - temperature plane where diffusion grows under densification .",
    "this is called anomalous diffusion region which reflects the contradiction of this behavior with the free volume picture described above .",
    "this means that diffusion anomaly involves more complex mechanisms which will be discussed below .",
    "the last anomaly we discuss here is structural anomaly .",
    "initially this anomaly was introduced via order parameters characterizing the local order in liquid .",
    "however , later on the local order was also related to excess entropy of the liquid which is defined as the difference between the entropy and the ideal gas entropy at the same @xmath4 point : @xmath5 .",
    "in normal liquid excess entropy is monotonically decaying function of density along an isotherm while in anomalous liquids it demonstrates increasing in some region .",
    "this allows to define the boundaries of structural anomaly at given temperature as minimum and maximum of excess entropy .",
    "the regions where these anomalies take place form nested domains in the density - temperature @xcite ( or pressure - temperature @xcite ) planes : the density anomaly region is inside the diffusion anomaly domain , and both of these anomalous regions are inside a broader structurally anomalous region .",
    "it is reasonable to relate this kind of behavior to the orientational anisotropy of the potentials , however , a number of studies demonstrate water - like anomalies in fluids that interact through spherically symmetric potentials @xcite .    as it was discussed in many works ( see , for example , the reviews @xcite and @xcite ) the presence of two length scales in the core - softening potential may be the origin of water - like anomalies : a larger one , associated with the external finite repulsion ( effective at lower pressures and temperatures ) , and a smaller one , related to the particle hard core ( dominant at higher pressures and temperatures ) . in those thermodynamic regimes where the two length scales are both partially effective and thus are competing with each other , a system of particles interacting through such potentials behaves , in many respects , as a mixture of two species of different sizes .",
    "this leads to the existence of two competing local structures : an expanded structure characterized by large open spaces between particles , and a collapsed structure in which particles are spaced more closely .",
    "the evolution of these structures under changing the thermodynamic conditions can result in the anomalous behavior .",
    "for example , as it was shown in many works ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the low temperature thermodynamic anomalies of liquid water arises from the intermittent fluctuation between its high density and low density forms , consisting largely of 5-coordinated and 4-coordinated water molecules , respectively .",
    "however , it should be noted that in general the existence of two length scales is not enough to mark the occurrence of the anomalies .",
    "for example , for the models studied in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the existence of two distinct repulsive length scales is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of anomalous phase behavior .",
    "the problem of anomalous behavior of core - softened fluids was widely discussed in literature ( see , for example , the recent review @xcite ) . it was shown that for some systems the anomalies take place while for others do not @xcite . in this respect",
    "the question of criteria of anomalous behavior appearance remains the central one .",
    "however , another important point is still lacking in the literature - the behavior of anomalies along different thermodynamic trajectories . here",
    "we call as `` trajectory '' a set of points belonging to some path in @xmath6 space . for example , the set of points belonging to the same isotherm we call as `` isothermal trajectory '' or shortly isotherm .    in our previous work we showed @xcite",
    "that anomalies can exist along some trajectories while along others the liquid behaves as a simple one .",
    "taking into account this result , it is interesting to study the behavior of the quantities demonstrating anomalies along the different physically significant trajectories ( isotherms , isochors , isobars and adiabats ) . this investigation will allow to get deeper understanding of the relations between anomalous behavior and thermodynamic parameters of the system which spread light on the connection between thermodynamic , structural and dynamic properties of liquids .",
    "the simplest form of core - softened potential is the so called repulsive step potential which is defined as following : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the diameter of the hard core , @xmath9 is the width of the repulsive step , and @xmath10 is its height . in the low - temperature limit @xmath11 the system reduces to a hard - sphere system with hard - sphere diameter @xmath9 , whilst in the limit @xmath12 the system reduces to a hard - sphere model with a hard - sphere diameter @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , melting at high and low temperatures follows simply from the hard - sphere melting curve @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the relevant hard - sphere diameter ( @xmath9 and @xmath8 , respectively ) .",
    "a changeover from the low-@xmath16 to high-@xmath16 melting behavior should occur for @xmath17 .",
    "the precise form of the phase diagram depends on the ratio @xmath18 . for large enough values of @xmath19",
    "one should expect to observe in the resulting melting curve a maximum that should disappear as @xmath20 .",
    "the phase behavior in the crossover region may be very complex , as shown in  @xcite .    in the present simulations",
    "we have used a smoothed version of the repulsive step potential ( eq .  ( [ 1 ] ) ) , which has the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "we have considered @xmath23 . here and below we refer to this potential as to smooth repulsive shoulder system ( srss ) .    in the remainder of this paper we use the dimensionless quantities : @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 .",

    "one could argue that , in the glassy region , the present system behaves like a `` quasi - binary '' mixture of spheres with diameters @xmath8 and @xmath33 and that the freezing - point depression is analogous to that expected in a binary system with an eutectic point : there are some values of the diameter ratio such that crystalline structures are strongly unfavorable and the glass phase could then be stable even at very low temperatures .",

    "it was shown that for the more steeper soft - core the regions of the density and diffusion anomalies become more narrow , while the region of the structural anomaly is only weekly affected , and the disappearance of the density and diffusion anomalies for the steeper potentials is due to a more structured short - range order .",

    "however , if a single curve does not demonstrate the anomalous behavior , having a set of the curves , one can see the presence of anomalies via the curves crossing .",
    "we also analyze the applicability of the rosenfeld entropy scaling relations to this system in the regions with the water - like anomalies .",
    "it is shown that the validity of the rosenfeld scaling relation for the diffusion coefficient also depends on the trajectory in the @xmath0 space along which the kinetic coefficients and the excess entropy are calculated .",
    "in particular , it is valid along isochors and isobars , but it breaks down along isotherms .",
    "the breakdown of the rosenfeld relation along isotherms is related to the fact that the boundaries of different anomalies do not coincide with each other .",
    "the influence of attraction on the diffusion anomaly is discussed .",
    "it is shown that the attraction makes the anomalies much more clear and may be found even in the cases when the anomalies are hardly seen for the purely repulsive potential due to simulation limitations .",
    "the question is whether this type of behavior is universal for all types of systems demonstrating the anomalous behavior .",
    "it is now widely believed that the water anomalies are related with the hypothesized liquid - liquid critical point , the terminal point of a line of first - order liquid - liquid phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the anomalies arise from crossing the widom line emanating from the hypothesized liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that the dynamical crossover from arrhenius to non - arrhenius behavior ( strong - fragile transition ) takes place both for water and jagla @xcite model . the jagla model with attraction displays ( without the need to supercool ) a liquid - liquid coexistence line that , unlike water , has a positive slope @xcite .",
    "we believe that our model should show the similar phase behavior as the jagla one , however , with the llcp in the deeply supercooled region @xcite .",
    "for example , in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig20 ] ( ( a ) - ( c ) ) we show the behavior of the isothermal compressibility @xmath3 , the isobaric heat capacity @xmath99 , and the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath2 for the system 1 in table 1 .",

    "[ fig : fig21 ] one can see the dynamical crossover from arrhenius to non - arrhenius behavior .",
