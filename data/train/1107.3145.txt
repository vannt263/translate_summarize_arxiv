    "etals are ubiquitous throughout galaxies .",
    "they are synthesised in stars and liberated into the interstellar medium ( ism ) when stars shed their outer gaseous envelopes towards the end of their lives , and in some cases also into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) when the highest mass stars explode as supernovae .",
    "the amount of metals in the diffuse gas around galaxies also determines the rate at which it is able to cool and form stars .",
    "metallicity is , therefore , one of the key physical properties of galaxies , and understanding the processes that regulate the exchange of metals between stars , cold interstellar gas , and diffuse surrounding gas can help us understand the physical processes that govern galaxy evolution in general .",
    "the metallicity of stars and gas in galaxies is known to correlate strongly with their luminosities , circular velocities and stellar masses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the physical processes that drive these correlations are not yet fully understood .",
    "@xcite and @xcite first suggested that interstellar gas can be driven out of galaxies by supernova explosions as _",
    "galactic outflows_. they predicted that galaxies of smaller mass have lower metal abundances because their lower escape velocities allow freshly enriched gas to be more efficiently removed .",
    "the input of energy from supernova explosions is now routinely incorporated into hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation , either in the form of thermal heating or ` kinetic feedback ' , whereby radial momentum kicks are imparted to particles surrounding sites of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "although these simulations are now able to demonstrate that galactic outflows can yield a good match to the observed mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. @xcite ) , this does not mean that outflows are the only process at work in regulating the metallicities of real galaxies .",
    "@xcite argue that a _ mass - dependent star formation efficiency _ ( sfe ) is required to explain observations , in addition to supernova feedback . in this scenario , less massive galaxies",
    "convert their gas reservoirs into stars over longer timescales than more massive galaxies .",
    "therefore , less massive galaxies have higher gas - to - stellar mass ratios and are consequently less metal - rich .",
    "motivated by their work on momentum - driven winds in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations , @xcite have also suggested that both metal - rich outflows at all masses and a variable star formation efficiency must play roles in explaining the observed mass - metallicity relation for nearby galaxies .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that _ metal - poor infall _ can regulate metallicity in disc galaxies .",
    "given that lower mass galaxies tend to have lower star formation rates ( due to the fact that their cold gas densities are lower ) , a net dilution takes place when the time - scale for star formation falls below the time - scale for accretion of metal - poor gas .",
    "this would drive down the low mass end of the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "finally , _ variations in the initial mass function _ ( imf ) have also been cited as another factor that might influence the mass - metallicity relation . @xcite",
    "propose that a sfr - dependent ( and therefore stellar mass - dependent ) imf causes different galaxies to produce different effective oxygen yields .",
    "this hypothesis is based on the premise that most stars form in stellar clusters and that smaller , less actively star - forming galaxies are dominated by clusters with lower masses , containing a smaller fraction of massive , oxygen - producing stars .",
    "we note , however , that there is little observational evidence for systematic imf variations between stellar clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the interpretation of the mass - metallicity relation is subject to considerable ambiguity has prompted a number of authors to consider alternative ways of quantifying metallicity in galaxies .",
    "for example , higher dimensional relations that include additional physical properties could provide better constraints on the processes that regulate metallicity .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed such an extension to the mass - metallicity relation , called the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) . in that work",
    ", it was shown that the gas - phase metallicities ( @xmath1 ) of both local and high - redshift galaxies were dependent on both stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the fmr provides a prediction of the metallicity of local galaxies with a 1@xmath3 scatter of only @xmath4 dex .",
    "this is a substantial improvement on the mean scatter of @xmath5 dex reported by @xcite for the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation .",
    "metallicity was also found to be strongly dependent on sfr at low stellar masses , but only very weakly dependent on sfr at high stellar masses .",
    "@xcite further showed that the fmr describes galaxies out to @xmath6 .",
    "the observed evolution of the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation was therefore attributed to migration of galaxies along the fmr plane to higher masses and lower star formation rates over time .    prompted by these findings , in this work we study higher dimensional relations between metallicity and a variety of physical galactic properties .",
    "we examine whether the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation exhibits additional dependences on sfr , specific sfr ( ssfr ) and @xmath7 .",
    "comparisons are made between the results from observational data and the predictions from semi - analytic models of galaxy formation implemented within a high resolution simulation of the evolution of dark matter in a ` concordance ' @xmath8cdm cosmology .    in section [ sec : the samples ] we present our observational sample , extracted from the latest sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopic data . in section [ sec : pdms ] , we explain how we obtain estimates of sfr and @xmath1 for our sample . in section [ sec : the fmr in observations ] we study the dependence of the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation on sfr , and the dependence of the sfr-@xmath1 and ssfr-@xmath1 relations on @xmath9 . in section [ sec : the fmr in l - galaxies ] we discuss the latest version of the semi - analytic galaxy formation code l - galaxies @xcite , implemented on the millennium - ii dark matter n - body simulation @xcite , and describe how we select samples of simulated galaxies for comparison with the observational data . in section [ model results ] we present these comparisons and show how trends in the relations between stellar mass , star formation rate and metallicity can be understood in terms of the prescriptions for gas accretion , star formation , supernova and agn feedback that are implemented in the model . in section",

    "this cut eliminates galaxies with metallicity measurements that are heavily biased towards the inner regions .",
    "we have checked that increasing the minimum fibre covering fraction to 0.35 ( following recommendations by @xcite ) , or raising the minimum redshift , does not affect any of the main results presented in this paper .",

    "drastic fluctuations in @xmath70 may occur when outflows become extreme enough to drive most of the gas out of the galaxy .",

    "we can see from the grey points in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - gals_indgalsevo ] that the scatter in the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation at @xmath0 increases towards lower masses as a consequence of this stochastic mode of evolution .",
    "we note that it is unclear whether this feature is seen observationally . @xcite",
    "have used a sample of 27 nearby dwarf galaxies to argue that the scatter in the observed local @xmath2-@xmath1 relation remains roughly constant down to stellar masses of @xmath84 . if confirmed with larger samples",
    ", this might suggest that , unlike metals , cold gas is not driven very effectively out of low mass galaxies by supernovae @xcite .    the main point to take away from fig .",
    "[ fig : l - gals_indgalsevo ] is that galaxies evolve along the present - day @xmath2-@xmath1 relation in the model , rather than from much lower metallicities , as suggested by observations .",
    "this suggests that it is indeed an overly rapid enrichment of the cold gas phase of galaxies before redshift three that is causing the lack of evolution thereafter in the model .",
    "one possible solution to the problem is that accreted gas is ` hung - up ' in the atomic phase of the ism for some time , before it is able to reach high enough densities to form the molecular clouds in which stars are formed @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite implemented simplified prescriptions for the formation of molecular gas in galaxies in the l - galaxies code , to study scaling relations between gas and stars in local galaxies .",
    "the recipes have , however , not yet been fully applied to models running on the higher resolution millennium - ii simulation , or to the more recent @xcite version of l - galaxies , which contains stronger and more mass sensitive feedback .",
    "this will be the focus of future work .",
    "in section [ sec : the fmr in observations ] , we have shown that our preferred observational sample , sample t2 , exhibits a reversal in the dependence of metallicity on star formation rate from low to high stellar mass . at low masses , low - sfr galaxies have higher metallicities compared to more star forming galaxies . at high masses , they have lower metallicities .",
    "this observation alone could be explained by considering mass - dependent , metal - rich outflows . at lower masses ( @xmath85 ) ,",
    "where outflows are more effective , low - sfr galaxies produce relatively fewer sne , disrupting the ism less and blowing away metals less efficiently ( e.g. @xcite ) . at higher masses ( @xmath86 ) , where outflows become increasingly weak , low - sfr galaxies simply produce less metals and so under - enrich the ism relative to more actively star forming galaxies .",
    "however , our model also shows a decrease in metallicity with stellar mass at fixed - sfr above @xmath87 . such a feature _",
    "can not _ be explained by mass - dependent outflows alone .",
    "if the turnover in the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation is indeed real , then additional physical mechanisms must be at play .",
    "our model points to metal - poor galactic infall at high - mass as an explanation .",
    "those high-@xmath2 galaxies with low gas - phase metallicities are known to have undergone gradual dilution of their gas phases after a merger event which shut - down further star formation .",
    "the restriction in the amount of infall by agn feedback allowed these galaxies to _ slowly _ dilute their ism , without accreting enough gas for star formation to resume .",
    "correlations between these galaxies and the high-@xmath2 , low-@xmath1 galaxies in our observational sample ( namely , their large black hole masses ) imply that such a dilution process could also be involved in shaping the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation in the real universe ( see also appendix b ) .",
    "there are , however , two factors hampering this interpretation .",
    "first , the dependence of @xmath1 on sfr is itself strongly dependent on how these properties are measured ( see section [ sec : the fmr in observations ] ) .",
    "although a high - mass dependence is undeniable in our sample t2 , it is not present in sample t1 , at least not within the range of masses studied .",
    "second , the recipes used to model physical processes in l - galaxies , although up - to - date with current theory , are still rather crude , and this could be affecting the galaxy evolution seen in our model galaxies . for example , metals are assumed to fully mix with the ism _ before _",
    "galactic outflows are allowed to drive gas out of the galaxy .",
    "this means that it is the subsequent cessation of star formation in low - mass galaxies that is causing the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 in the model , rather than explicitly metal - rich outflows .",
    "additionally , and perhaps relatedly , there is a lack of evolution in the model @xmath2-@xmath1 relation , contrary to observations .    despite these two caveats ,",
    "we believe our interpretation to be viable . on the observational side ,",
    "the use of many emission line fluxes and sed fitting ( as is done for many trusted stellar mass estimations ) is likely to be a more robust way of estimating metallicities than using individual emission line ratios ( see appendix a ) . on the modelling side ,",
    "the problems outlined above are currently common to models in general .",
    "for example , the sph simulation described by @xcite , which exhibits the same evolution of galaxies along the present - day @xmath2-@xmath1 relation , also has difficulties reproducing the observed metallicity evolution .",
    "their favoured _",
    "vzw _ model ( which invokes momentum - driven winds and metal - rich outflows at all masses ) shows an increase in @xmath1 of @xmath88 dex from @xmath82 to 0 for galaxies of stellar mass @xmath89 . their fixed , low wind velocity _",
    "model shows an evolution of @xmath5 dex ( an amount similar to that seen in l - galaxies ) . in comparison , observations suggest an evolution of @xmath90 dex at the same mass from @xmath91 to 0.07 @xcite",
    ". further improvements to the observational determination of gas - phase metallicities , and the ongoing improvements in accurate modelling of galactic evolution , are necessary before significant progress can be made in this area .",
    "we have shown that the gas - phase metallicities of galaxies are dependent on their star formation rate .",
    "this is also true at high masses , where highly star forming galaxies are seen to have higher metallicities  the opposite trend to that seen at low masses . however , despite this dependence , a projection onto the @xmath2-sfr-@xmath1 space that combines @xmath2 and sfr does little to reduce the scatter in @xmath1 compared to the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation .",
    "we also demonstrate the significance of metallicity derivation methods when assessing the relation between @xmath2 , sfr and @xmath1 .",
    "strong line ratio diagnostics , such as r@xmath55 , provide significantly different metallicity estimates to bayesian techniques which utilise emission line fluxes .",
    "these differences are greater for low star forming galaxies .",
    "although we believe that the bayesian technique used for our sample t2 provides a more robust measurement of the global gas - phase metallicity in local , high - metallicity , star forming galaxies , it remains unclear to what extent this is so .    in section [ model results",
    "] , we show that a high - mass sfr - dependence is also present in our model sample .",
    "this is due to a turnover in the mass - metallicity relation , caused by a gradual dilution of the gas phase in some galaxies , triggered by a gas - rich merger which shuts down subsequent star formation without impeding further cooling .",
    "we have proposed that similarities between these low - ssfr model galaxies and those observed at @xmath0 , such as their larger - than - average black hole masses , leave open the possibility that such a process is also driving the sfr - dependence seen at high masses in real galaxies . if this is the case , then physical processes other than mass - dependent outflows must also be playing a part in regulating metallicity .",

    "as mentioned in section [ sec : the m - z relation , as a function of sfr ] , obtaining accurate estimates of the gas - phase metallicity is not an easy process , as different diagnostics can provide very different results .",
    "however , it should be emphasised that the difference seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1t2_abundance_diff ] is not simply due to the inherent discrepancies between @xmath47 , empirical and theoretical metallicity derivation methods . for the range of metallicities covered by our samples ,",
    "both take their metallicities via theoretical methods .",
    "the difference is instead likely due to the use of either emission line ratios or emission line fluxes ( with a bayesian approach ) in the analysis .    on this point",
    ", it should be noted that theoretically derived strong line ratios are known to suffer from a number of problems , including degeneracies @xcite , sensitivity to the ionisation parameter @xcite , saturation at high metallicities @xcite and inconsistency with @xmath47 derived metallicities @xcite .",
    "it is not clear to what extent the technique used for sample t2 suffers from these effects .",
    "there have been some concerns over the treatment of secondary nitrogen in the population synthesis models used to produce the sample t2 metallicity estimates @xcite .",
    "early indications show that accounting for this by excluding the [ nii ] ( and [ sii ] ) lines from the bayesian analysis does not change the high - mass sfr - dependence seen . removing these lines only seems to have a significant effect at low - masses , strengthening the dependence of z on sfr seen there .",
    "there are , however , two particular issues affecting the strong line ratio calibrations used for sample t1 at high metallicity .",
    "first , there is the binning of data by @xcite when calibrating the diagnostics used for our sample t1 .",
    "a fit to unbinned data would have heavily biased their diagnostics against the lower metallicities crucial for high redshift studies such as theirs , due to the paucity of low-@xmath1 galaxies available in their present - day calibration sample . however",
    ", this does mean that their fits are less precise at high metallicities , which is important for their application to local samples such as ours .",
    "their r@xmath55 diagnostic over - predicts the average metallicity slightly compared to the average values obtained from the @xcite model for @xmath92 ( see fig . 5 in the @xcite paper ) .",
    "this raises the metallicity estimated in this regime somewhat , despite the use of the @xmath93/\\textnormal{h}\\alpha$ ] diagnostic to bring down the final value .",
    "second , @xcite have already pointed out that their metallicity derivation method  which uses the same calibration sample as @xcite  may over estimate the gas metallicity at @xmath94 by a factor of @xmath5 dex compared to the @xcite method .",
    "this is partly due to the bias towards selecting strongly @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] emitting galaxies in the sample causing the fit to be steeper at high metallicities . when considering the r@xmath55 diagnostic",
    ", the fact that h@xmath14 emission is also weaker in low star formation environments could explain why the discrepancy we see is more significant at low - sfr .",
    "taking this into account , it is perhaps prudent to suggest that such ratios are not ideal for estimating metallicities for high-@xmath1 , local samples , where the availability of good spectroscopic data , including all optical emission lines , allows alternative techniques to be utilised .",
    "the adaptation made to sample t2 in section [ sec : black hole masses ] is to include an additional set of 9,275 high - mass ( @xmath97 ) galaxies to the sample .",
    "these are the galaxies removed from the default sample t2 due to having 1@xmath3 uncertainties in their stellar mass estimates greater than 0.2 dex .",
    "the reason for this larger error seems to be due to large errors in the u - band magnitude measured , which is included in the estimation of stellar mass .",
    "this error has therefore likely propagated through to the confidence in the best fitting model during sed fitting , causing these galaxies to have a larger uncertainty in their @xmath2 estimate .",
    "[ fig : t2_mz_errors ] shows that , for masses greater than @xmath98 , these additional galaxies have only slightly greater 1@xmath3 errors on their mass estimates than the default sample t2 galaxies , and that their metallicity estimates are actually more than good enough for them to remain in the sample .",
    "we therefore choose to included these high - mass galaxies for our analysis of black hole mass .",
    "their addition is not a necessary condition , but does provide more low - ssfr galaxies and makes the dichotomy seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr - z_bh ] clearer .",
    "it is interesting to note that when plotting the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation for sample t2 including these additional galaxies , a range of sfr - dependent turnovers can be clearly seen at high mass .",

    "errors on the values of @xmath2 ( solid lines ) and @xmath1 ( dashed lines ) provided by the best fitting models for the default sample t2 ( thick lines ) , and for the additional galaxies described in appendix b ( thin lines ) . at high masses , the error in @xmath2 for the additional galaxies is only slightly greater than for the sample t2 galaxies .",

    "<S> high - mass galaxies , on the other hand , have lower gas - phase metallicities if their star formation rates are small . remarkably , the same trends are found for our sample of model galaxies . by examining the evolution of the stellar component , gas and metals as a function of time in these galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , we gain some insight into the physical processes that may be responsible for these trends . we find that massive galaxies with low gas - phase metallicities have undergone a gas - rich merger in the past , inducing a starburst which exhausted their cold gas reservoirs and shut down star formation . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter , these galaxies were able to accrete metal - poor gas , but this gas remained at too low a density to form stars efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> this led to a gradual dilution in the gas - phase metallicities of these systems over time . </S>",
    "<S> these model galaxies are predicted to have lower - than - average gas - to - stellar mass ratios and higher - than - average central black hole masses . </S>",
    "<S> we use our observational sample to confirm that real massive galaxies with low gas - phase metallicities also have very massive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that accretion may therefore play a significant role in regulating the gas - phase metallicities of present - day massive galaxies .    </S>",
