    "this family is surely a spmeexi although the authors did not consider a stochastic process view in the kernels @xmath39 .",
    "the main interest of _ spmeexi _ s is first to have in hands an infinite class of estimators and especially , as shown in segers ( segers ) , to have the possibility to build discrete and continuous combinations of the margins as new and powerful estimators .",
    "number of the estimators of the extreme value index are either functions of consecutive log - spacings @xmath40 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , or are functions of log - spacings from a threshold @xmath43 : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath42 . in the last case ,",
    "the threshold is usually taken as @xmath46 .",
    "this simple remark teases the idea that taking functions of the log - spacings in place of the simple ones may lead to more general estimators .",
    "@xcite successfully experimented to the so - called moment estimator by using the power functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 some available spmeex s are functions of these log - spacings as we will see soon . here , in this paper , we aim at presenting a more general functional form in the following @xmath50indexed by some classes @xmath4 of functions @xmath51 , and by @xmath52 .",

    "@xcite  deduced the following estimator of the extreme value index    @xmath63    our objective is to show that these two stochastic processes ( [ tf01 ] ) and ( [ tf02 ] ) are spmeexi s . in this paper , we focus on the stochastic process @xmath64 which uses sums of independant random variables . as to @xmath65 to the contrary",
    ", it uses sums of dependent random variables .",
    "its study will be done in coming up papers .",
    "as announced , we focus on the stochastic process ( [ tf01 ] ) here .",
    "we have been able to establish its finite - dimension asymptotic distribution . as already noticed in earlier works in lo _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) , the limiting law may be gaussian or non - gaussian . in both cases ,",
    "statistical tests may be implemented . in case of non - gaussian",
    "asymptotic limits , the limiting distribution is represented through an infinite series of standard exponential random variables .",
    "its law may be approximated through monte - carlo methods , as showed in fall _ et al .",
    ".    then we prove that it is a spmeexi in the sense of convergence in probability .",
    "both for asymptotic distribution and convergence in probability , the used conditions are expressed with respect to an infinite series of standard exopnential randoms variables and through the auxiliary functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the representations of @xmath68 s in the extreme domain of attraction that will be recalled in the just next subsection .",
    "the conditions are next notably simplified by supposing that the _ df _ @xmath69 is differentiable in the neighborhood of its upper endpoint .    to show how work the results for specific classes of functions @xmath57 , we adapt them for @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "it is interesting to see that although we have the existence of the asymptotic laws for any @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we do nt have an estimation of @xmath21 in the region @xmath73 , when @xmath74 .",
    "one advantage of using spmeexi s is that we may consider the best estimators , in some sense to be precised , among all margins .",
    "we show in theorem [ theo3 ] that @xmath75 is asymptotically gaussian for @xmath76 . when we restrict ourselves in that domain , we are able to establish that the minimum asymptotic variance is reached for @xmath77",
    ". then we construc the best estimator @xmath78 , that is for @xmath77 .",
    "this is very important since the hill estimator is @xmath79 itself and , as a consequence , the hill estimator is an element of a set of best estimators indexed by @xmath80 . in fact , it is the best of all , that is @xmath79 has less asymptotic variance than @xmath81 .",
    "+ it will be interesting to found out whether this minimim variance can be improved for other functional classes . + even when we have a minimum asymptotic variance estimator , it is not sure that the performance is better for finite samples .",
    "this is why simulation studies mean reveal a best combination between bias and asymptotic variance . at finite sample size",
    ", the performance of an estimator is measured both by the bias and the variance and we do nt know how the random value of the estimator is far from the exact value .",
    "we will see in the simulation section [ sec4 ] that the boundary case @xmath82 gives performances similar to the optimal case .",
    "+ before we present the theoritical results and their consequences , we feel obliged to present a brief reminder of basic univariate extreme value theory and some related notation on which the statements of the results will rely on .",
    "let us make this reminder by continuing the lines of ( [ dl05 ] ) above .",

    "@xmath95 on @xmath2 defined as follows : @xmath96@xmath97one easily checks that if @xmath98 then @xmath99 whenever @xmath100    theses facts allow to parameterize the class of extremal distribution functions .",
    "for this purpose , suppose that ( [ dl05 ] ) holds for the three _ df _ s given in ( [ dl05a ] ) , ( [ dl05b ] ) and ( dl05c ) .",
    "we may take sequences @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that the limits in ( [ dl05f ] ) are @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( in the case of frchet extremal domain ) , and @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( in the case of weibull extremal domain ) .",
