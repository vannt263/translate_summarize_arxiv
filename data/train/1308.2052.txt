    "scalar @xmath2 photon @xmath0 interaction through dimension five operators originates in many theories beyond standard model of particle physics , usually in the unified theories of electromagnetism and gravity @xcite .",
    "the scalars involved can be moduli fields of string theory , kk particles from extra dimension , scalar component of the gravitational multiplet in extended supergravity models etc . to name a few [ @xcite-@xcite].though the main emphasis of such models",
    "had been unification of forces , however the same idea has also been used to solve the dark matter and dark energy [ @xcite@xcite ] problems of the universe , as in the chameleon models for dark matter[@xcite@xcite ] .",
    "+ physics of compactification  of extradimensions  introduces various kinds of model dependent interactions .",
    "for instance in the original kaluza- klein ( kk ) model @xcite , compactification of the extra fifth dimension was constructed to unify gravity with electromagnetism , that introduced dim-5 @xmath3 interaction . in string theories  constructed in ten or twenty six dimensions ",
    "the extra - dimensions are compactified and models have been made to find out various observable consequences of the same .",
    "one such model , invoked to explain the weakness of gravity relative to other forces , was developed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite . in this model , (",
    "also known as `` large extra dimension '' model ) , the standard model particles are confined to a four dimensional membrane , and gravity propagates in the other spatial dimensions , those are large compared to plank scale .",
    "however there also exist models ( with one or more extra spatial - dimensions ) , where all fields propagate universally @xcite .",
    "collider signatures of higher dimensions has been studied in @xcite .",
    "other than the collider signatures mentioned above , effort has also been made in @xcite , to relate the effect of extra dimension with four dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "+ interestingly enough , the dimension-5 photon scalar interaction term generated in the lagrangian @xcite by compactification of the extradimension , would eventually bear optical signatures of the same .",
    "the purpose of this note is to study such effects coming from dim-5 scalar photon interaction in some detail and shed some new light on their astrophysical consequences .",
    "+ usually dim-5 interactions ( be it scalar photon or pseudoscalar ( axion ) photon interactions ) , induce optical activity .",
    "the scalar or pseudoscalar photon interaction turns vacuum into a birefringent and dichoric one @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the plane of polarization of a plane polarized beam of light keeps on rotating as it passes through vacuum .",
    "this particular aspect of the theory has been exploited extensively in the literature in a different physical context ( with pseudoscalar photon coupling ) [ @xcite-@xcite ] .",
    "+ keeping this in view , in this note , initially , we have studied the optical signatures of dim-5 , @xmath4 interaction in an ambient magnetic field of strength @xmath5 gauss . following this ,",
    "we have considered a toy model for the steller enviornment of a strongly magnetized , rotating , ultra cold , compact astrophysical objects like white dwarf ( wd ) and neutron star ( ns)to understand some issues related to  emission energy and altitude @xcite , that is believed to affect the produced spectra of electromagnetic radiations ( em ) , originating there . as a next logical step ,",
    "we have made an effort to explore the potential of the later , in modifying the usual spectral signatures of the tree - level dim-5 , @xmath6 coupling  from such astrophysical situations .",
    "we would like to mention here , that , this model of ours is a toy model .",
    "the purpose of this construction is , to motivate further investigations of the possible modifications to the emission spectra , from actual wd or ns environment , when @xmath6 interaction has been taken into account . +",
    "while investigating the effects of @xmath4 interaction , in this note we have been able to achieve three objectives : ( i ) verifying the earlier results @xcite through an independent approach , ( ii ) showing the possibility of generation of circular and elliptic polarization from a plane polarized light beam  as the same passes through the steller environment.(iii ) pointing out the possibility of some extra modifications to the usual polarimetric signatures of @xmath4 coupling , due to emission altitude vs energy relation , that has been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "+ it became very obvious for the first time in @xcite that , existence of superluminal propagation modes for low frequency photons are possible , in a model with dimension-5 @xmath4 interaction term present in the lagrangian .",
    "the analysis there , was performed in terms of the gauge potentials , using lorentz gauge , leaving a scope of _ gauge ambiguities _ as a source of the problem . in order to rule out any role of the same , for the afore mentioned problem",
    ", we have taken a different approach , using the field strength tensors and bianchi identity for deriving the same .",
    "our new approach establishes the results obtained earlier .",
    "+ to shed light on the second issue , we have assumed the radiation , produced at the production point , to be plane polarized electromagnetic wave ( with orthogonal planes of polarization , as is the case for synchro - curvature radiation ) .",
    "what we find is : _ the same generates a significant amount of scalar component through @xmath4 interaction , well before it is out of the stellar atmosphere _ ; this is some thing , that needs to be considered when one is looking for signatures of dim-5 mixing operators from astrophysical polarimetric data .",
    "also , though the initial beam of radiation is plane polarized , however during its passage it picks up significant amount of elliptic / circular polarization through mixing .",
    "the amount of elliptic / circular polarization generated through mixing is energy @xmath7 dependent with a complex dependence on @xmath7 along with the strength of the magnetic field @xmath8 , coupling constant @xmath9 as well as the distance @xmath10 traveled in the stellar atmosphere . during our analysis ,",
    "we have also looked into the pattern of polarization angle @xmath11 and ellipticity angle @xmath12 that the beam of radiation generates at different wavelengths , after propagation through the same distance .",
    "what is very interesting is the existence of identical polarization angle ( @xmath11 ) at and ellipticity angle @xmath12 for multiple values of energies(@xmath7 ) when the traversing path is same .",
    "the details of the same are discussed later .",
    "+ the organization of the document is as follows , in section - ii , we have derived the equations of motions .",
    "section three is dedicated to the determination of the dispersion relations and the solutions of the equations of motions . in section four",
    "we discuss about the possible observables and applications , including a brief introduction to stokes parameters .",
    "introduction to the physics of magnetized astrophysical compact objects ( toy model ) and ideas behind energy vs emission altitude mapping [ @xcite-@xcite ] is presented in section five .",
    "results are presented in section vi .",

    "component of the mean field is nonzero and rest are zero .",
    "therefore @xmath20 ] the equations of motions for the scalar and the electromagnetic fields turn out to be , + @xmath21 the two equations [ [ emeq1 ] ] and [ [ emeq2 ] ] are the two equations of motion governing the dynamics of the system in an external magnetic field described by the tensor @xmath22 .",
    "here we consider @xmath22 to be a very slowly varying function of coordinates , so that the same can be considered to be effectively constant .",
    "we note here that these two equations carry the information about the three degrees of freedom of the system , two for the two polarization states of the photon and the third one for the scalar degree of freedom .",
    "in this section we would get the dispersion relation for the scalar photon coupled system of equations . equation [ [ emeq1 ] ] in general would provide three equations , corresponding to two transverse and one longitudinal states of polarization for the photon .",
    "however in vacuum photons has only two transverse degrees of freedom , so one of the three would be redundant .",
    "the last equation i.e.,[[emeq2 ] ] would provide the dynamics of scalar degree of freedom , thus making the total number of degrees of freedom for the coupled system to be three .",
    "+ we can get to the dynamics of the three degrees of freedom for the scalar photon system by two methods , by ( a ) using the gauge potentials and choosing a particular gauge , or by ( b ) making use of the bianchi identity . in this work",
    "we would chose the second method .",
    "that is using the bianchi identity : + @xmath23 if we now multiply the bianchi identity by @xmath24 and operate with @xmath25 , we arrive at the identity , @xmath26    one can now take equation , eqn.([emeq1 ] ) and multiply it by @xmath27 and operate with @xmath28 subsequently use eqn .",

    "[ [ kpetc ] ] , we have assumed that , to order @xmath14 , @xmath46 . + being armed with these ( i.e. findings of eqn . [ [ kpetc ] ] ) , the equations of motions for the combined photon and scalar system can be written in matrix form : + @xmath47 the matrix equation [ [ m1 ] ] does not look symmetric because the dimension of @xmath1 and the dimensions of @xmath48 or @xmath33 are different . to bring the same in symmetric form , we multiply the @xmath1 equation in eqn.[[eomphi ] ] by @xmath49 , and redefine @xmath1 by @xmath50 , when @xmath51 to arrive at , @xmath52 \\left [ \\begin{matrix } { \\tilde{\\psi } } \\cr \\psi \\cr    \\phi \\end{matrix } \\right]= 0 \\label{m2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] +      it can be seen form eqn.[[m2 ] ] , that because of the presence of off diagonal elements , two dynamical degrees of freedom out of the three , ( @xmath53 and @xmath50 ) during their propagation mix with each other . the matrix in eqn.[[m2 ] ]",

    "one can verify that the dispersion relations obtained from [ [ m2 ] ] or [ [ diagbasis1 ] ] are identical to those in @xcite , provided appropriate limits are taken .",
    "+ its worth noting that eqn .",
    "[ [ m2 ] ] or [ [ diagbasis1 ] ] actually shows that in the case of scalar photon interaction , photons with polarization state perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath8 remains unaffected and propagates with speed of light and the same with polarization state parallel to the magnetic field couples to the scalar and undergoes modulation .",
    "as we will see later that there exists a critical energy ( @xmath62 ) below of which the perpendicular modes have imaginary @xmath7 , hence they would be non - propagating .",
    "however the perpendicular mode does nt suffer from this pathological problem , hence ( for energy below @xmath62 ) they would propagate freely .",
    "therefore light coming from distant sources with @xmath63 would appear to be linearly polarized provided this type of interaction does exist in nature .",
    "+ we emphasize here , that , much of our analysis performed in this paper would have remained the same even if we had dim-5 interaction , thus making it difficult to identify the type of interaction responsible for polarimetric observation that is being invoked in this note .",
    "+ however , the way out is to note that the parallel and perpendicularly polarized components of the photon in these two different kind of interactions ( _ scalar or pseudoscalar _ ) interchange their role in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "hence the polarization state of the linearly polarized light for scalar photon interaction would be orthogonal to the same with axion photon system .",
    "therefore in principle one can look for this signature in polarimetric observations to point out the kind of interaction responsible for the type of signal .",

    "it should be noted however , that , the same with nonzero scalar mass and/or other interactions present in the lagrangian , may lead to a more complex situation and an exact analytical result may not be possible .",
    "we wo nt be elaborating on this issue any further ( here ) , it would be dealt with in a separate publication .",
    "the predictions for the class of theories under consideration here , can be tested through optics based experiments set up for laboratory or astrophysical environments .",
    "for instance through the observations of the index of the power ( of the ) spectrum , checking the differential dispersion measure or through the measurements of polarization angle , ellipticity at different wavelengths .",
    "the analysis in this paper , are seemingly more suitable for dispersive and/or polarimetric measurements for verifying the predictions of these theories .",
    "more over , since we are more interested to find out the astrophysical implications of the theory being studied and optics based experiments are more suitable for the same , therefore , we will concentrate on dispersive or polarimetric analysis here .",
    "+      in this section we would apply our results for astrophysical situations .",
    "they are of interest because the ambient magnetic field available there , are many orders of magnitude more , than the same available in laboratory conditions ; also the length of the path the light beam traverses is enormous . keeping this in view",
    "we would opt for astrophysical considerations . in astrophysical situations most of the interesting emission mechanisms are of no - thermal nature . as the charged particles in these situations accelerate in the ambient electromagnetic field , they radiate electro magnetic ( em ) radiations .      in this section",
    "we provide the expression for the mutually orthogonal amplitudes of the polarized radiations coming from synchrotron or curvature radiations following [ @xcite- @xcite ] .",
    "the amplitudes of the electromagnetic radiation parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath79 @xmath80 plane  from the synchrotron or curvature radiation are given by , @xmath81 in eqn.([power1 ] ) , @xmath82 is the peak energy for radiation spectrum with , @xmath83 , the lorentz boost factor for the emitting particles and @xmath84 the radius of curvature of the particle trajectory .",
    "the differential intensity spectrum , given by , @xmath85 grows as @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and falls off exponentially for @xmath88 .",
    "it is evident from eqn.([power1 ] ) that , the em spectrum from synchrotron or curvature radiation are emitted in two orthogonally polarized states .",
    "+      in astrophysical situations , dispersive and polarimetric measures are very effective to extract information about a system .",
    "for an object at a distance d we can measure the time taken by the signal to reach us by measuring @xmath89 .",
    "that is , by measuring @xmath90 @xcite .    in cosmological situations",
    "red shift z can be , converted to proper distance using ( for @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 the hubble constant being related to to h , by @xmath94 and @xmath95 obtained from the wmap data @xcite . since we are using natural units , we can take @xmath96 .",
    "this in principle can be performed for gamma - ray bursters or pulsar observations . in this energy band",
    "the dispersion measure of ( time ) should come out to be the proper provided restricts oneself to high energy band , to avoid the medium induced dispersion effects that s dominant in the low energy domain .",
    "+ in the previous sections we already have mentioned that , for the kind of interaction under consideration in this work , the vacuum turns out to be birefringent and dichoric for the photons .",
    "so the two polarized modes of photon , propagate with different speed .",
    "so , in principle , the orthogonally polarized signals from an astrophysical object , that originating from the source at the same space time point , would reach the observer at two different epochs . a similar argument taking into account the effect of stellar magnetized plasma was initially put forward in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , this argument has been discussed unfavorably in @xcite , and probably needs more refinement e.g. , taking into account the kind of effect being discussed here and magnetized intergalactic domains , etc .",
    "detailed analysis of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper and would be done elsewhere using the techniques of@xcite .",
    "most of the astrophysical objects are associated with magnetic field , with strengths varying from @xmath97 to @xmath98 gauss .",
    "since synchrotron or curvature radiation are some of the most efficient non - thermal radiative mechanisms , the astrophysical objects mostly radiate non - thermally via this processes . a characteristic signature of the radiation coming through this process is , the radiation is polarized along and perpendicular to the @xmath79 , @xmath99 plane ; where @xmath79 is the direction vector from the source to the observer and @xmath100 is the ambient magnetic field direction .",
    "the amplitude and the spectrum of the radiation are well known and are discussed later in this paper .",
    "the intrinsically polarized nature of the produced radiations turns out to be useful to perform polarimetric analysis of the observed data from astrophysical sources .",
    "the observables for polarimetric analysis are degrees of polarization , linear ( @xmath101)or circular ( @xmath102 ) and total polarization ( @xmath103 ) @xcite . in view of this",
    "we would take a digression to the essentials of stokes parameters before estimating the polarimetric observables .      in order to evaluate the polarimetric variables ( stokes parameters )",
    ", one can construct the coherency matrix by taking different correlations of the vector potentials or the fields @xcite .",
    "various optical parameters of interest like polarization , ellipticity and degree of polarization of a given light beam , can be found from the components of the coherency matrix constructed from the correlation functions stated above @xcite . + for a little digression , the coherency matrix , for a system with two degree of freedom is defined as an ensemble average ( where the averaging is done over many energy bands ) of direct product of two vectors : @xmath104 one important thing to note here , is , under any anticlock - wise rotation by an angle @xmath105 about an axis i.e. , perpendicular to the vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the coherency matrix would transform as : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the rotation matrix .",
    "now from the relations between the components of the coherency matrix and the stokes parameters : @xmath110 + it is easy to establish that , @xmath111 therefore , under an anticlock wise rotation by an angle @xmath105 , about an axis perpendicular to the plane containing @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the density matrix transforms as : @xmath114 ; hence the coherency matrix in the rotated frame would be given by , @xmath115 since for a rotation by an angle @xmath105in the anticlock wise direction ( about the axis that is perpendicular to the plane having @xmath116 and @xmath117 on it ) the rotation matrix @xmath118 is given by , @xmath119 as a consequence the two stokes parameters @xmath120(z ) and @xmath121 ( z ) , in the rotated frame of reference , would get related to the same in the unrotated frame , by the relation",
    ". @xmath122 the other two parameters , i.e. , i and v remain unaltered .",
    "it is for this reason that some times i and v are termed invariants under rotation .",
    "+ we would like to point out here that , in any frame , the stokes parameters are expressed in terms of two angular variables @xmath12 and @xmath11 usually called the ellipticity parameter and polarization angle , defined as , @xmath123 the ellipticity angle , @xmath12 , following [ [ stokes2 ] ] , can be shown to be equal to , @xmath124 and the polarization angle can be shown to be equal to .",

    "( blue line ) and ellipticity @xmath12 ( orange line ) , for coupling constant @xmath166 and @xmath167 gauss  vs @xmath7 . ]    the physics of the optical activity , in this scenario , is the following , as the produced electromagnetic beam propagates in the magnetized stellar environment , the photons with polarization orthogonal to the magnetic field , keep mixing with the scalars resulting in a change of phase for the same ; and the photons with polarization along the magnetic field propagates freely .",
    "the superposition of the two decides the net polarization of the system . since the change of phase is dependent on ( a ) the path traversed by the radiation beam , ( b ) the strength of the ambient magnetic field and ( c ) the frequency of the photons the final magnitude of the net polarization of the radiation beam depends on all the three .",
    "since we are interested in the wave propagation in an ambient ( magnetic ) field of strength @xmath168 gauss , believed to exist close to surface of the star , we need know the critical synchro - curvature energy @xmath156 , of the emitted photons there in .",
    "+ the same has been obtained , as already mentioned , using the relations of section iv .",
    "the critical energy of the emitted photons , as a function of altitude from a ultra cold , ( wd or ns ) pulsar ( with period p=0.5 sec . ) was evaluated and plotted in fig .",
    "[ [ figure3 ] ] .",
    "the numerical data showed that , at altitudes very close to the surface of the star ( @xmath169 km ) , the critical energy , turns out to be of the order of @xmath170 gev , and it reaches the value of @xmath171 gev , at an altitude of @xmath172 km or so . + therefore assuming the initial amplitudes for both the polarized modes to be the same , we have estimated the stokes parameters numerically for a frequency range of @xmath173 gev to @xmath174 gev , for @xmath175 ( from pvlas data @xcite ) and magnetic field strength @xmath176 gauss .",
    "the propagation length is taken to be about @xmath177 cm ( about @xmath178 , when @xmath179 cm , is the stellar radius which is close to that of the astrophysical compact objects ) .",
    "the result is plotted in the fig .",
    "[ [ figure11 ] ] . +",
    "as can be verified from the initial conditions that , at @xmath180 the stokes parameter u is nonzero but q and v are both zero ( i.e we have linearly polarized light ) .",
    "however the variations of the same , after propagation through , a distance @xmath178 , as a function of energy @xmath7 can be seen from figure [ figure11 ] . as is clear from the plots , that at low energy , elliptic polarization , defined by stokes parameter v , though is small in magnitude but the same undergoes modulation with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "similar behavior is also observed to be taking place with u. however , the stokes parameter q does nt undergo similar modulation in magnitude at high energies .",
    "+ it can be checked from the plots that there are situations when both q and v are simultaneously zero except u , signaling linear polarization and vice - verse . as the frequency changes , the degree of linear polarization decreases and that of circular polarization increases .",
    "this is due to @xmath0 , @xmath1 mixing effect .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that , degree of linear and circular polarization due to @xmath4 coupling need not be of very close order at all energies .",
    "+ the other important observation that we had mentioned already is , that the ellipticity @xmath12 and polarization angles @xmath11 are generally multi - valued functions of the energy @xmath7 .",
    "there can be various values of energies @xmath7 at which the @xmath11 and @xmath12 could turn out to be the same , but mostly they are not , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figure22 ] .",
    "+ it should however be noted that , the effects we have discussed so far are purely due to mixing , where the polarized multi wavelength beams are supposed to have travelled the same distance .",
    "this may be achievable in laboratory conditions , however , the same may not hold for all class of astrophysical objects and all kinds of emissions mechanisms .",
    "+ compact astrophysical objects ( stars ) usually radiates through synchro - curvature radiation , in many energy bands .",
    "energy of an emitted photon depends on the emission altitude  measured from the surface of the star . for compact stars , this relationship ,",
    "is referred at times as altitude energy mapping .",
    "the nature of this mapping depends on the details of the model of the compact object . in our illustrative model",
    "the low energy photons originate close to and higher energy photons originate far away from the surface of the compact star",
    ". therefore the low energy modes would pass through larger distance in the magnetized media than the high energy ones .",
    "+ so the kind of polarizations two light beams ( say at two different energies @xmath181 and @xmath182 , with @xmath183 ) , are going to acquire would be different once they are out of the stellar environment .",
    "this is because the two different path lengths traveled by the the two beams in the magnetized stellar media , due to emission geometry . since for the kind of physical picture for we have in mind ( wd , ns or quasars ) , a radiation beam , due to altitude energy effect ( following dipole emission models ) , would be having multiple energies where each of these individual components would be traveling different path - lengths in the magnetized stellar atmosphere , once out of the stellar environment .",
    "therefore , in addition to the @xmath184 mixing induced polarization effects  an additional path dependent effect would also show up at various energy bands of the synchro - curvature radiations coming from wd or ns because emission - altitude energy relations , that these radiations follow .",
    "hence , for a consistent interpretation of the observations , the same needs to be accounted for . +      another important point that we would like to point out here , is , although the number of scalar particles produced in the synchro - curvature emission model of wd or ns are usually zero ( from kinematical or other considerations ) , however , by the time the emitted radiation is out of the stellar environment a significant amount of scalars may be generated because of the mixing effect .",
    "+ therefore , while analyzing synchro - curvature spectra of radiations from far away wd or ns , one would need to take this in to consideration for the fixing boundary conditions , along with the effect of multiple magnetized intergalactic domains ( similar model was considered in @xcite , however the radiation sources considered there were different ) .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the findings of this work .",
    "we have tried to point out , in this work , the important polarimetric signatures in the synchro- curvature radiation spectra of cosmologically far away compact objects ( wd or ns ) because of scalar photon mixing .",
    "+ our findings are the following : the mixing effect itself is capable of producing ( a ) elliptic or circular polarization from initially plane polarized beams , ( b ) the amount of or plane , circular or elliptic polarization generated at different energies need not be of same magnitude at all energy bands , for the beams traveling through the same distance and same fields strength ( magnetic field strength @xmath8 ) , ( c ) polarization and ellipticity angles are multivalued functions of energy .",
    "there may be several energy bands where the angles repeat themselves , ( d ) significant amount of scalars may be produced in the beams once they are out of the stellar environment , ( e ) the physics of emission of synchro - curvature radiation for these sources , makes the monochromatic beams at different energy bands , travel different path lengths in the stellar environment . hence a phase difference , coming from the difference of path travelled by the beams of light at different @xmath7 ,",
    "will contribute to their polarimetric signatures .",
    "therefore , even with running the risk of repetition , we would like to emphasize , that , degree of linear and circular polarization need not be close to each other , with dim-5 photon scalar coupling .",
    "+ once the electromagnetic signal is out of the stellar environment , it would propagate through the ambient magnetized intersteller , galactic and inter - galactic space before reaching the observer .",
    "signals from far away objects may also travel through multiple magnetized domains in the inter - galactic space .",
    "since em waves undeergo faraday rotation @xcite in magnetized enviornment , therefore to find out the contribution of scalar photon mixing operator to polarimetric data , one needs to estimate further , the faraday rotation induced contribution to the same , following the procedure discussed in @xcite . however , this analysis is out of scope of current study and the same will be undertaken else where .",
