    "recently , our views of world have been changed by promoting nonlinear physics .",
    "the investigation of nonlinear systems with noise terms opens the way for a real breakthrough in many scientific and technical fields .",
    "for instance noise plays an important role in noise - induced phase transitions , stochastic resonance ( sr ) , reversal current , etc .",
    "usually , in nonlinear systems the noise affects the dynamics through system variable .",
    "the noise could be both multiplicative and additive @xcite .",
    "a white correlation between a multiplicative white noise and an additive white noise was presented first by fulinski and telejka@xcite .",
    "after that , the liouville equation , van kampen theorem , and novikov theorem were applied to describe the stochastic dynamics of nonlinear system @xcite . from 1995 , in order to study a non - markovian bi - stable system , colored noise approximation has been employed @xcite .",
    "next , approximate fokkerplanck equation of system driven by multiplicative and additive colored noises with colored cross - correlation , was study by liang et al @xcite .",
    "since many years , finding the tumor growth law , with the aim of cure and control its growth , has been main problem for scientists .",
    "they employed physical , mathematical , biological and chemical methods to obtain a solution for this purpose . both simulation and experiments of the immune responses of mice",
    "show environmental pressures including hast tissue pressure , immune response and so on , can change the tumor growth .",
    "moreover , some factors , such as drugs effects , fluctuation of temperature , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , etc . , can have significant effects on the growth of the tumors .    in recent years",
    ", nonlinear stochastic systems with noise terms has been employed to describe the biologist system . in order to explain the growth of the tumor cells , ai et al .",
    "@xcite first applied logistic growth model induced by correlated noises .",
    "their research shows that strong fluctuation of the growth rate could exterminate tumor cells .",
    "afterward , zhong et al . investigated the multiplicative and additive gaussian white noises in tumor growth model @xcite .    in this paper , the model of tumor growth with the correlated additive and multiplicative noises",
    "is discussed .",
    "we will show how noise correlation dynamically leads to tumor extinction .",
    "the highlight points in this report are : choosing of colored noises , multiplicative noise effects on carrying capacity of environment and correlation between two noises . due to these considerations",
    ", the different behavior of the tumor in different condition will be presented .",
    "we will illustrate the tumor responses respect to the treatment in the specific condition .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , a model of tumor growth with the correlated additive and multiplicative noises",
    "is present . in section 3",
    ", we deal to fokkerplank equation and stationary probability distribution . in section 4 , by presenting the curves of probability distribution and mean number of tumor cells , the effects of the noise parameters on tumor growth model is discussed . finally , concluding remarks are made in in section 5 .",
    "let us take the logistic model found by verhulst @xcite :    @xmath0    where x denotes the cell population , r is the linear per capita birth rate and k is the carrying capacity of the environment .",
    "equation [ eq : verhulst ] denotes an ideal equation without fluctuation .",
    "we consider effects due to same external factors such as temperature , drags , radiotherapy , etc .",
    "these factors are able to influence directly the tumor cell number as well as alter the tumor growth rate . as the other articles , we show these effects by multiplicative and additive noise , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . as a result , the langevin differential equation with two multiplicative noise @xmath1 and additive noise @xmath2 becomes :    @xmath3    we consider the multiplicative noise effects on carrying capacity of environment .",
    "the noises are colored noises with the following properties :    @xmath4    where q and d are the strengths of the two noises and @xmath5 illustrates the degree of correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath6 ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the self - correlation times of multiplication and additive noises ; and @xmath9 is the cross - correlation time between the noises . if @xmath10 , the form of the noises and its correlation will change from exponential to gaussian .",
    "according equation ( 2 ) , the equivalent fokker plank equation can be derived as :    @xmath11    where p(x , t ) is the probability distribution function . according to the method , presented in reference @xcite , a(x ) and b(x ) are    @xmath12+\\frac{\\lambda\\sqrt{dq}}{1+r\\tau_{3}}(1-\\frac{2x}{k}),\\end{array}\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath13^{2}+\\frac{2\\lambda\\sqrt{dq}}{1+r\\tau_{3}}\\left[x(1-\\frac{x}{k})\\right]+\\frac{q}{1+r\\tau_{2}}.\\ ] ] as a result the stationary probability distribution of equation is obtained as :    @xmath14    where n is normalization constant .",
    "meanwhile the mean of cell number reads    @xmath15    , @xmath16 , @xmath17,@xmath18 ; with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while @xmath21 and @xmath22,width=302 ]",
    "in model , fallowing reference @xcite , the effect of the treatment on tumor is shown as the intensity of multiplicative noise ; the capability of expansionary transfer of the tumors is refereed by the strength of additive noise , as well as , the adaptability of the tumors to the treatments is represented by the correlation between additive and multiplicative noise .",
    "in fact , the noises are the tumor response to external effects .",
    "figure 1 shows probability distribution of the number of tumor cells for different noise correlation , @xmath5 . obviously , when @xmath24 , the distribution of probability peaks only in the large x ; in this case , the tumor grows steadily and fast .",
    "if @xmath25 , distribution of probability has two peaks , one peak emerges near @xmath26 , presenting the probability of the tumor extermination , and another peak is near @xmath27 , denoting the adaption of some tumor cells to the treatments .",
    "this case illustrates that the tumor growth is unsteadily and the tumor is stimulated by treatment . when @xmath28 , the stationary probability distribution switches from bi - peak to uni - peak state .",
    "the uni - peak appears at small x , it shows that the tumor exterminates itself steadily .",
    ", @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( a)@xmath18 , ( b ) @xmath17 , ( c ) @xmath29 [ fig : spd - q / d],height=151 ]    the probability distribution of the tumor cell number depends to the rate of additive to multiplicative noise intensity , @xmath30 .",
    "it is plotted in figures 2 for different values of @xmath31 .",
    "as one can see , the probability distribution changes from uni - peak to bi - peak stats as the @xmath30 decreases .",
    "the bi - peak states show the unsteadily growth and existence of a phase transition in the growth law , driven by noise .",
    "the probability distribution curve for @xmath20 when @xmath18 in fig.2 ( a ) , has a maximum at x=5 ; if @xmath25 in fig.2 ( b ) , the curve has two maximums at the x=1 and x = k , presenting tumor is slightly stimulated ; and for @xmath16 in fig.2 ( c ) has one maximum at the x = k , which shows the good adaption of the tumor to the treatment .",
    "factually , figures 2 show the response of the tumor to the different intensity of treatment in different condition .",
    "we focus to the steady state of the probability distribution ( uni - peak ) and study mean number of tumor cell .",
    "it is found that the steady probability distribution could be obtained for @xmath32 .",
    "dependence of the mean number and variance of the tumor cells in steady condition are illustrated in fig.[fig : main - variance ] for different values @xmath31 .",
    ", width=302,height=151 ]    fig.[fig : spd - t ] shows the evolution of probability distribution of tumor cell number under different values of self - correlation time .",
    "as the self - correlation time decreases the probability distribution becomes wider ; it means the variance of the tumor cell number increases .",
    "the small self - correlation times show the white noise effect on model .",
    "the insets of figures [ fig : spd - t ] show the dependence of the mean number of the tumor cell to self - correlation time .",
    "it confirms that by increasing self - correlation time , the mean number of tumor cell decreases .    ,",
    "k=10 , r=0.6 and @xmath18 , inset : the evaluation of mean number < x > respect to the self - correlation time ( a ) @xmath33 , ( b ) @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : spd - t],title=\"fig:\",height=151 ] , k=10 , r=0.6 and @xmath18 , inset : the evaluation of mean number < x > respect to the self - correlation time ( a ) @xmath33 , ( b ) @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : spd - t],title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    as a result control of the tumor growth is possible by finding high value of @xmath30 and self - correlation time with the negative correlation between two noises , @xmath28 .",
    "in other word , the tumor cell number can be controlled by choosing proper noise parameters .",
    "the positive or negative effect of the treatment on the tumor environment can have significant influence on growth and extension of the tumor @xcite .",
    "scientists believe that therapies , such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy , are like two - edged sword . sometimes therapy causes the normal cells to become abnormal or cancerous .",
    "as we showed , tumors show different behavior in different condition . in some cases ,",
    "the tumors help to their treatment and exterminate themselves .",
    "tumor behaviors depend on the correlation of the tumor properties , its environment and treatment .",
    "we should employ high precision in choosing strength of the treatment ( i.e. the intensity of the ray in radiotherapy and the dosage of the medicine in chemotherapy ) respect to the tumor environment and its properties .",
    "also , it is better that the variation of tumor mass be recorded during treatment to find the negative cross - correlation and matched the appropriate strength of the treatment to the tumor behavior .",
    "in conclusion , the probability distribution and the mean of the tumor cell number could be influenced by the noises .",
    "the sorts of the noises are environment , treatments and other properties of tumor .",
    "the configuration of the probability distribution curve can be transformed from the single maximum to the double maximum by changing the noise parameters . by choosing the proper noise parameters",
    ", we can control the mean of tumor cell number to be smaller .",
    "we have shown that the correlation between two noises can choose the behavior of the tumor respect to treatment .",
    "it is important for us that tumors exterminate themselves .",
    "it is possible by finding high rate of additive to multiplicative noise intensity , and self - correlation time with the negative cross - correlation between two noises .",
    "it means that by finding appropriate intensity respect to the tumor environment and its properties , tumors would help to their treatment ."
