    "if experiments at future accelerators , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the international linear collider ( ilc ) , discover susy they will also have to determine precisely the underlying susy - breaking scenario .",

    "lhc analysis : _ in most cases the masses of the susy particles can only be studied by analysing complicated decay chains , like @xmath0 which might be difficult to resolve .",
    "the precise reconstruction of the states in the decay chains requires in particular the knowledge of the mass of the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , which is often assumed to be stable . in sps1a",

    "the heavier gauginos / higgsinos is extremely challenging due to mass degeneration .    _",
    "ilc analysis : _ precise simulations for the mass measurements of the sleptons and the light charginos and neutralinos show that an accuracy of much less than 1  gev can be achieved at the ilc with @xmath2  gev .",
    "particularly interesting is the high accuracy in the determination of @xmath3 with @xmath4  gev from @xmath5 decays , but also the accuracy @xmath6  gev and @xmath7  gev are important .    it has been assumed that the cross sections for @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been precisely measured at different energies @xmath10 , @xmath11  gev and for different beam polarizations @xmath12",

    "the masses of the heavy neutralinos and charginos can now be predicted .",
    "concerning again studies at the lhc such mass predictions from the ilc analysis lead to an increase of statistical sensitivity , which could be crucial for the search for statistically marginal signals : together with a precise knowledge on the mass of the lightest stable particle @xmath17 and the light slepton masses measured at the ilc , the mass predictions lead to a clear identification of the dilepton edge from the @xmath18 decay chain , followed by precise mass measurements of these heavy particles , cf .",
    "[ fig - mchi04 ] .",
    "measuring the heavy particles right at the predicted masses provides an important check of the underlying susy model .",
    "such an important model check has been studied in detail in  @xcite , where two basic supersymmetric models , the mssm and the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) have been analyzed .",
    "the nmssm @xcite is the simplest extension of the mssm by an additional higgs singlet field .",
    "the corresponding additional fifth neutralino may significantly change the phenomenology of the neutralino sector due to the suppressed coupling to ordinary gauge bosons of the singlino admixture  @xcite .    in this case",
    "study a scenario has been presented where all kinematically accessible neutralinos and charginos have similar masses and almost identical cross sections , within experimental errors , in mssm and nmssm .",
    "although the second lightest neutralino in the nmssm has a significant singlino component , the models can not be distinguished by the experimental results at the lhc or at the ilc@xmath19 with @xmath2 gev alone if only measurements of masses , cross sections and gaugino branching ratios are considered .",
    "also the higgs sector does not allow the identification of the nmssm .",
    "precision measurements of the neutralino branching ratio into the lightest higgs particle and of the mass difference between the lightest and next - to - lightest susy particle may give first evidence for the susy model but are difficult to realize in our case .",
    "therefore the identification of the underlying model requires precision measurements of the heavier neutralinos by combined analyses of lhc and ilc .",
    "although the neutralinos @xmath20 have significant singlet components of about @xmath21 in the nmssm , the masses of the accessible light neutralinos and charginos , as well as the production cross sections , lead to identical values in the two models within experimental errors .",
    "_ lhc / ilc analysis : _ as described in the previous section , the interplay analysis at both colliders allows to determine the fundamental parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 with high precision .",
    "the parameters lead within the assumed experimental uncertainty to predictions for the heavy neutralinos and their mixing character : the mssm predicts an almost pure higgsino - like state for @xmath22 and a mixed gaugino - higgsino - like @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ fig - nmssm ] .",
    "however , such a prediction of the mixing character contradicts the outcome of the lhc , where only neutralinos with a sufficiently high gaugino admixture can be resolved : @xmath23  gev .",
    "such a contradiction leads obviously to the correct identification of the supersymmetric model .",
    "scenarios where the squark and slepton masses are very heavy ( multi - tev range ) are particularly challenging . in most studies to determine the fundamental susy parameters , it has been assumed that the masses of the virtual scalar particles are already known . in the case of heavy scalars such assumptions , however , can not be applied .",
