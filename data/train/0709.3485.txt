    "our knowledge of the high frequency radio - source population is poor .",
    "important advances were made recently by the 15ghz surveys with the ryle telescope ( taylor et al .",
    "2001 ; waldram et al .",
    "2003 ) covering @xmath8 to a flux density limit of 25mjy and going down to 10mjy in small areas .",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite has surveyed the whole sky at 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 and 94  ghz to completeness limits of @xmath9jy ( bennett et al .  2006 ; hinshaw et al .  2007 ;",
    "lpez - caniego et al .",
    "2007 ) , but there is little information in the flux densities range between 200  mjy and 1  jy .",
    "high frequency surveys are very time - consuming . for telescopes with diffraction limited fields of view the number of pointings necessary to cover a given area scales as @xmath10 . for a given receiver noise ,",
    "the time per pointing to reach the flux density level @xmath11 scales as @xmath12 so that , for a typical optically thin synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath13 ) , the survey time scales as @xmath14 : a 20  ghz survey takes more than 110 times longer than a 5  ghz survey with the same aperture covering the same area of sky to the same flux density level",
    ".    however , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) studies , boosted by the on - going nasa wmap mission and by the forthcoming esa planck mission , require an accurate characterization of the high frequency properties of foreground radio - sources both in total intensity and in polarisation .",
    "radio sources are the dominant contaminant of small - scale cmb anisotropies at mm wavelengths : their poisson contribution to temperature fluctuations is inversely proportional to the angular scale , i.e. linearly proportional to the multipole number @xmath15 , while the power spectra of the cmb and of galactic emissions decline at large  @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "poisson fluctuations dominate for @xmath16 .",
    "a high frequency catalogue complete down to hundreds of mjy levels ( the rms in wmap maps is @xmath17  mjy at all frequencies ) over a large area , complemented with a good characterization of source properties , can be used to correct the contaminating effect .",
    "it may be necessary for the high frequency surveys to go even fainter than the rms in the cmb observations .",
    "this is because fluctuations in numbers of weak sources ( particularly if there is clustering ) could affect power spectrum estimation : it depends on the source counts at weak flux density levels and the contribution to the angular power spectrum from sources at different flux density intervals .",
    "furthermore , forthcoming telescopes in the southern hemisphere , like the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , that will operate at frequencies above 90ghz , require suitable calibrators which can be readily selected using large area high frequency surveys ( sadler et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "optical surveys for transients , which would be severely contaminated by galactic novae , could use high frequency radio surveys as templates to identify potential transients associated with agns ( rau et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "a pilot survey ( ricci et al .  2004 ;",
    "sadler et al .  2006 ) at 18.5  ghz was carried out in 2002 and 2003 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "it detected 173 objects in the declination range @xmath18 to @xmath19 down to 100  mjy .",
    "the pilot project characterised the high - frequency radio source population and allowed us to optimise the observational techniques for the full australia telescope 20  ghz ( at20 g ) survey .",
    "the full survey will cover the whole southern sky to a flux density limit of @xmath20  mjy .",
    "it began in 2004 and will be completed in 2007 .",
    "to date we have completed the survey from the south pole to declination @xmath21 .",
    "more than 4400 sources were detected , down to a flux density of 50  mjy .",
    "we expect another 1500 sources in the declination range @xmath22 for which the analysis is still on - going .",
    "this paper presents the analysis of the brightest ( @xmath23  jy ) extragalactic ( @xmath0 ) sources in the at20 g survey based on the observations in the declination range @xmath24 surveyed between 2004 and 2007 .    in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] we describe the observing techniques . in ",
    "[ sec : pipeline ] we describe the data reduction methods that have been applied to the whole survey and the selection criteria for the bright source sample .",
    "after presenting the sample in   [ sec : sample ] , in ",
    "[ sec : properties ] we illustrate its main properties in terms of source populations , spectral behaviour in total intensity and polarised emission .",
    "we also compare our results with those of analyses of samples at lower or similar frequencies and discuss the possible impact on cmb studies . in   [ sec : conclusions ] we summarise our conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ sec : indsrc ] we list some notes on individual sources of interest .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     all the follow - up measurements include polarisation .",
    "once the low quality data have been removed from the sample , we take , as ` detections ' , measurements of integrated polarised flux at least 3 times higher than their errors ( see   [ sec : polarisation ] ) .",
    "we had a polarisation detection at 20  ghz for 213 sources ( 34 cases are non detections , the others have low quality data in polarisation and the data have not been considered ) .",
    "the median fractional polarisation is 2.5 per cent , calculated considering also upper limits with a survival analysis procedure .",
    "the median polarisation degree is found to be somewhat lower at lower frequencies : it is 2.0 per cent at 8  ghz and 1.7 per cent at 5  ghz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] ) .",
    "a similar trend was found by burke et al .",
    "( in prep . ) for the sub - sample observed in october 2006 during the observation run dedicated to high sensitivity polarisation observations . a detailed analysis of polarisation data will be presented in that paper .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] the spectra for polarised flux density are very diverse and show little correlation with total flux density .",
    "this makes it even more difficult to predict high frequency polarisation properties from low frequencies observations than it is to predict @xmath25 .",
    "there is no clear relation between the spectral properties of the sources and their polarised flux , nor is there any unique trend in the spectral behaviour of the total intensity and the polarised emission .",
    "the spectral shape in the polarisation is often quite different from the spectral shape in the total intensity .",
    "the matrices of spectra in tables  [ tab : matrix ] and  [ tab : matrix_m ] are complex but not random .",
    "the diagonal cells dominate indicating that nearly 50 per cent of the sources have polarised spectra similar to those in @xmath25 .",
    "however the flat and peaked spectrum sources stand out with an excess of rising polarisation spectra .    for sources with peaked spectra",
    "the polarised fraction generally decreases below the turnover frequency ; an example of this behaviour in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ( third panel , bottom row ) .",
    "this is not surprising as a polarisation mode which has a high emission coefficient should also have a high absorption coefficient , so in moving from optically thin ( high frequencies ) to optically thick ( low frequencies ) conditions we expect that the ratio of the intensities in the two modes will decrease .",
    "there are , however , other reasons why the polarised fraction might decrease at lower frequencies , including :    * depolarisation due to faraday rotation intrinsic to the sources ; * superposition of multiple components with different polarised spectra ; * depolarisation due to spatial variations in faraday rotation across the source ; * bandwidth depolarisation due to very high levels of faraday rotation .    figures  [ fig : ps ] and [ fig : ms20 ] plot the polarised flux and fractional polarization as a function of flux density .",
    "the data from our pilot observations ( sadler et al 2006 ) suggested a marginal trend for weaker sources to have higher fractional polarization .",
    "although this seems to be present in figure  [ fig : ms20 ] the median fractional polarization as a function of flux density has no trend and indicates that the apparent effect is due to the increased density of points at lower flux levels .",
    "the sources with a peak in the spectrum above 5  ghz have lower fractional polarization at 20  ghz but this effect is not very pronounced .",
    "[ fig : ms ] shows the distribution of fractional polarisation at 5 , 8 and 20  ghz .",
    "jy is pictor  a.,width=226 ]     and @xmath26.,width=226 ]            due to the lack of deep large area surveys at frequencies above 15ghz the comparison of our results has to be done with low frequency catalogues . because of variability between catalogue epochs a direct comparison can only provide hints on the spectral behaviour as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the results of the cross - correlation with nvss at 1.4  ghz and sumss at 0.843  ghz have been listed in table 2 .",
    "all 172 bss sources in the sky region overlapping with the nvss survey have at least one counterpart in nvss ( within less than 1.2  arcmin from the position of the bss source ) .",
    "a total of 149 bss sources have a counterpart in sumss .    at 2.7  ghz",
    "we have cross - matched the bss with the parkes quarter jy sample ( jackson et al .",
    "2002 ) . of the 314 bss sources in the overlapping declination range ,",
    "163 have a counterpart . at 4.85",
    "ghz the cross - correlation with the pmn catalogue shows that 316 bss sources have a counterpart in pmn .",
    "the four bss sources without a pmn counterpart lie in the small regions of sky where the pmn survey was incomplete ( see , e.g. , figure  2 of wright et al.1996 ) .",
    "the 4.8  ghz flux densities from our observations have been used for comparison with these two catalogues ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pks ] and [ fig : pmn ] ) .",
    "the closeness in frequency reduces the spectral effects and the scatter mainly results from variability .",
    "the few sources that fall below @xmath27  mjy have the most inverted spectra since our sample is flux limited at 20  ghz .",
    "there are 88 bss sources in the 185 sources monitored with the atca at 1.4 , 2.5 , 4.8 and 8.4  ghz at up to 16 epochs by tingay et al .",
    "in addition to fractional polarisations at each frequency , and a measure of source extendedness , the multi - epoch monitoring enabled a variability index to be assigned for each frequency .",
    "the monitoring was done to support the vsop survey program , and 87 bss sources are included in the 5  ghz survey of bright compact agn ( hirabayashi et al .",
    "results from the these space vlbi observations are presented by scott et al.(2004 ) and dodson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and will be discussed in more detail in a later paper describing the vlbi properties of the bss .",
    "the contamination due to point sources is a crucial limitation to the cmb power spectrum determination on the smaller angular scales ( less than @xmath28  arcmin ) .    the best frequency region to study the cmb is around 70  ghz , where the effects of foregrounds emissions is at a minimum , but in any case it is necessary to enlarge the frequency range as much as possible to try to single out all the foreground components and improve the component separation techniques .",
    "however , the efficiency of these methods relies on a good knowledge of the source populations to improve the capabilities of blind detection methods for ` point ' sources ( lpez - caniego et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the variety of source spectral behaviours implies that , as mentioned , it is extremely difficult to make reliable flux density extrapolations from low to high frequency .",
    "variability and confusion effects complicate the situation even more .",
    "also , the forthcoming planck mission will be strongly confusion limited . according to lpez - caniego et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the @xmath29 detection limits range from @xmath30mjy at 30  ghz to @xmath31mjy at 100  ghz , while the rms noise levels are far lower ( from @xmath32mjy at 30  ghz , valenziano et al.2007 , to @xmath33mjy at 100  ghz ; lamarre et al .",
    "2003 ) : this means that there is a lot of astrophysical information in planck maps below the confusion limit , that can be to some extent extracted , e.g. using stacking techniques , thanks to the at20 g survey and follow - up observations at higher frequencies .    as a test of high frequency predictions from low frequency samples we selected a sample from the pmn catalogue with declination below @xmath34 and @xmath35 and cross",
    "- matched it with sumss to obtain the low frequency spectral behaviour .",
    "then we divided it into sub - samples according to different limits in flux density at 5 and 1ghz and/or according to different spectral indices at those frequencies .",
    "finally , for each sub - sample we considered how many pmn sources are in the sample and how many of them have a counterpart in the bss .",
    "in fact , the efficiency of the detection depends on the ratio between what is present at the selection frequency and what is effectively found at the detection frequency ( _ detection rate _ ) , and on the completeness of the sample obtained at the detection frequency .",
    "there are 154 bss sources with declination below @xmath34 and @xmath35 and 152 have a pmn counterpart",
    ". however , 35 pmn counterparts have flux density at 5ghz below 0.50jy , so that a low frequency selection threshold at 500mjy would have lost them . selecting only inverted sources ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) results in a low detection rate ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 per cent respectively ) and a low completeness of the sample at high frequency ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 per cent respectively ) .",
    "a flux density selection at 5ghz implies a decreasing completeness with increasing 5ghz flux density threshold ( from 90.2 to 71.9 per cent changing from 250 to 500  mjy ) with low , but increasing detection rate ( from 11.3 to 27.5 per cent in the same flux density range ) : 289 pmn sources with a counterpart in sumss with declination below @xmath4530@xmath46 and @xmath35 have flux density above 500mjy and no counterpart in the bss .",
    "combining spectral and flux density limits or adding further selection criteria at 1ghz improves the detection rate but at the cost of a very low completeness of the high frequency sample .",
    "thus , it is clear that low frequency catalogues could provide positions for constrained search techniques ( cf .",
    "lpez - caniego et al.2007 ) , but are inadequate to forecast the high frequency population .",
    "the comparison of flux densities with wmap map - based catalogues shows a good agreement in general ( we used the newps catalogue as in gonzlez - nuevo et al .",
    "2007 in fig .",
    "[ fig : newps ] ) .",
    "the epochs of observations partially overlap , but since the wmap maps have been averaged over three years , transient phenomena have been smoothed out .",
    "furthermore , both space- and ground - based missions require a set of carefully selected sources to work as calibrators for pointing , total intensity flux densities and polarisation angle .",
    "the bright source sample we have discussed is well - suited for cmb studies in the next years .",
    "it collects a sample of the brightest sources in the southern sky , that , thanks to the low variability observed , will be observable or detectable by any detection method .",
    "the observational frequency is , so far , the closest to the region of the spectrum of interest for cmb studies .",
    "the bright source sample provides a direct test of source detection algorithms , quantifying the completeness , the fraction of spurious detections , the effective beam size ( and therefore the flux calibration ) and the possible presence of biases in flux density estimates .",
    "it also provides a rich list of candidate flux density and pointing calibrators over a large fraction ( 37 per cent ) of the sky .",
    "finding suitable polarisation calibrators for cmb experiments is much more complicate .",
    "for example , the large low frequency beams of the planck satellite ( 33 arcmin beam at 30ghz ) dilute the polarised signals by summing over differently oriented polarisation vectors . thus",
    ", finding sources with large enough polarised flux density within such beams is very hard ( figs .  [ fig : ps ] and [ fig : ms20 ] ) .",
    "a more extensive discussion about such calibration will appear in burke et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .        to make optical identifications for objects in the bright source sample , we searched the supercosmos catalogue ( hambly et al.2001 ) near the positions of all sources .",
    "objects within 10@xmath46 of the galactic plane ( flagged with a ` g ' in table  2 ) were excluded from the analysis because the presence of foreground stars and galactic dust extinction makes optical identifications incomplete in this region .",
    "this cutoff in galactic latitude excluded 69 of the 320 bss sources .",
    "two other sources were also excluded from the optical analysis : sources number 57 and 160 ( according to the sequential numeration in table  2 ) lie so close to bright foreground stars that no optical identification is possible from the dss images .",
    "source number 73 lies within the boundaries of the large magellanic cloud and its identification is uncertain .    an optical object was accepted as the correct i d if it was brighter than b@xmath47=22mag and lay within 2.5arcsec of the radio position .",
    "monte carlo tests imply that at least 97 per cent of such objects are likely to be genuine associations ( sadler et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we found a dss identification for 238 of 249 sources , with 235 of the optical ids having @xmath48mag . on the basis of the supercosmos classification of each object as stellar or extended , there are 188 qsos ( 77 per cent of the sample ) , 47 galaxies ( 19 per cent ) and the remaining are blank fields .",
    "the median @xmath49 magnitude is 18.6 for qsos and 17.7 for galaxies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bsrccnt4 ] ) .    we have also checked in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) for optical identifications in order to distinguish between galactic and extragalactic objects : none of the sources in the bss which have a clear identification are galactic objects ( i.e. hii regions , planetary nebulae or snrs ) .      after completing the optical identifications , we checked ( ned ) to search for published redshifts .",
    "a listed redshift was accepted only if it could be traced back to its original source and appeared to be reliable .",
    "177 of the 249 bss objects ( 71 per cent ) had a reliable published redshift , including three of the sources which are blank fields on the dss ( these objects were identified in deeper optical images by other authors ) .",
    "the 72 objects without a published redshift include seven objects ( sources number 10 , 19 , 30 , 42 , 85 , 221 and 278 as listed in table  2 ) which have a redshift listed in ned . in these cases , we were either unable to trace back to its original source , or considered to be unreliable for other reasons ( pks  0332@xmath45403 , source 42 in table  2 , was previously discussed in this regard by shen et al.1998 ) .",
    "redshifts for two bss objects ( sources number 33 , a qso at @xmath500.466 qso , and 313 , a qso at @xmath500.626 based on a single broad emission line identified as mgii ) were obtained from a pre - release version of the final redshift catalogue from the 6df galaxy survey ( jones et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 in preparation ) .",
    "the redshift for source 138 has been measured with the eso 3.6 m telescope by pge and his collaborators ( edwards et al . in preparation ) .",
    "optical spectra of nine other bss sources were obtained at the anu 2.3 m telescope in april and june 2007 by r.w .",
    "hunstead and two of the authors ( ph and em ) .",
    "redshifts were measured for seven of these objects ( sources number 77 , 98 , 140 , 162 , 166 , 208 and 246 ) .",
    "the spectra of two other objects ( number 68 and 78 ) showed a featureless optical continuum from which no redshift could be measured .",
    "among the 186 objects with redshifts , 144 are qsos and 36 are galaxies .",
    "the median redshift is 1.20 for the qsos and 0.13 for the galaxies(fig .",
    "[ fig : zsrccnt ] ) .",
    "no correlation is observed between redshift and total 20  ghz flux density or polarised flux . as noted by sadler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) there is a correlation between redshift and optical magnitude for galaxies in the at20 g sample , but this does not apply to the at20 g quasars ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bz ] ) .      six bss objects with good  quality optical spectra ( either from the published literature or from unpublished 6df/2.3  m data ) ,",
    "have no measured redshift because the spectra are featureless .",
    "such objects generally fall into the bl lac class , though it is possible that some of them fall in the ` redshift desert ' at @xmath51 where qsos show no strong lines in the optical .",
    "the correlation between the difference of the spectral indices at high and low frequencies ( @xmath52 ) with redshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig : steepening_z ] ) shows a clear curvature in the spectra .",
    "note that the 20ghz flux densities from the higher redshift objects correspond to flux densities from the higher frequencies in the rest frame ( scaling as @xmath53 ) .",
    "since the median redshift of the qso in the sample is 1.20 , the steepening is occurring at frequency @xmath54ghz in the rest frame , and grows steeper to above @xmath55ghz in the rest frame for the objects at @xmath56 .",
    "although this correlation with redshift is most simply explained as the combination of increased spectral curvature with frequency and the changes in the rest frame frequency it should be noted that the bss sample does not cover a large enough flux range to break the degeneracy between distance and power so it could also be a correlation with power",
    ". further investigation of this correlation clearly needs the deeper sample , and would also benefit from more complete redshift information , since there may be selection effects in the sub - samples with existing redshift information .                 and @xmath57 with redshift.,width=226 ]",
    "we have presented a complete sample of 320 sources selected within the at20 g survey catalogue as those having flux density @xmath58jy , @xmath0 .",
    "almost simultaneous 5 and 8ghz observations have been used for spectral behaviour analysis .",
    "information on polarisation are available at all the frequencies .",
    "we found that the median fractional polarisation is increasing with frequency .",
    "neither the high frequency total intensity nor the polarisation behaviour can be estimated from low frequency information .",
    "we examined a set of issues that support this statement :    * the colour - colour plots show a broad range of spectral shape : most sources spectra are not power - law so do not allow easily extrapolation from one frequency to the other ; * the comparison with low frequency selected samples showed that by increasing the constraints on the low frequency sample the number of low frequency objects recovered also at high frequency increased , but that the completeness of the predicted high frequency sample gets poorer .",
    "it is necessary to fine tune the conditions on the low frequency sample to obtain a good trade - off between completeness and identification rate , but there is no way to select a low frequency sample that guarantees that all the sources will constitute a complete high frequency sample ; * the polarisation spectral shape does not agree in all the cases with the total intensity : the lack of knowledge on polarisation properties , together with unpredictable polarisation spectral behaviour make any forecast extremely difficult .",
    "it is clear that actual high frequency samples are better than trying to predict them from lower frequencies .",
    "so , the bright source sample constitutes an unprecedented collection of information at 20  ghz , that will turn to be of importance by itself and for any future observations at high radio frequencies .",
    "the whole at20 g survey , in fact , will improve the radiosource population knowledge to much lower flux densities .",
    "this amount of information will be of crucial interest for the next generation telescope , to provide good sample of calibrators , and for the cmb targeted missions , as a test for point source detection techniques , as a help in point - source removal in any component separation exercise and as a list of candidate pointing , flux and possibly polarisation calibrators .",
    "even with the relatively superficial analysis presented here , we find interesting new physical effects from this sample :    * spectral steepening is common in this class of object ; * the spectral steepening correlates with redshift , possibly due to changing rest frame frequency ; * sources with spectral peaks in the ghz range are common in this sample and have high depolarisation on the low frequency side of the peak .",
