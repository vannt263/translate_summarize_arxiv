    "assuming the validity of the cosmological principle , i.e. , that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous , we can apply the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric to the field equations of general relativity to derive a relation of cosmological distance measures to redshift for various cosmological parameter values .",
    "however , we know that our universe is very far from homogeneous on scales smaller than galaxy clusters . it is generally assumed that this does not affect the large scale expansion rate of the universe .",
    "still , inhomogeneities will affect measured distances through the effect of gravitational lensing .",
    "there will be different amounts of matter along different lines - of - sight , causing different amounts of focusing of the light - rays .",
    "it is not possible to obtain exact solutions of the field equations for general inhomogeneous models , thus one is referred to numerical simulations to compute gravitational lensing effects on distance measurements .",
    "sometimes , we would like to be able to use simpler methods to compute at least approximate distances .",
    "the dyer - roeder ( dr ) distance - redshift relation @xcite assumes that the expansion rate of the universe is governed by the total matter density whereas the focusing of light is only affected by a fraction @xmath0 of the total matter density .",
    "the dr distance thus contains an additional parameter , namely the homogeneity - parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "the approximation should be fair if a fraction @xmath4 of the matter density is in very compact objects and the light - ray travels far from all matter accumulations , i.e. , if one can neglect the effect of gravitational lensing .    in this paper",
    "we investigate properties of the dr distance - redshift relation by comparing with numerical simulations of the distance - redshift relation in inhomogeneous universes , including the effect from gravitational lensing .",
    "more specifically , we compute the best fit value of the homegeneity - parameter @xmath0 for different cosmologies and inhomogeneity models",
    ". these values can be used , e.g. , with some of the publicly available routines for computing cosmological distances @xcite .    in an earlier study",
    ", tomita @xcite has found the best - fit value of @xmath0 to be one in most cases , with a dispersion in @xmath0 dependent on the cosmological model , the redshift and separation of light - rays .",
    "in fig.[fig : dr ] , we have plotted the dr angular - diameter distance in units of the hubble - length for different values of the homogeneity - parameter @xmath0 . the larger the value of @xmath0 , the larger the amount of focusing of the light - rays .",
    "thus , the angular - diameter distance decreases monotonically with @xmath0 , i.e. , it increases with the `` inhomogeneity - parameter '' , @xmath4 .",
    "note also that there is a simple relation between the luminosity distance , @xmath5 , and the angular - diameter distance @xmath6 , @xmath7    using the simulation package snoc @xcite , we have used light - ray tracing to obtain angular - diameter distances with different inhomogeneity models and different values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "gravitational lensing effects are calculated by integrating the geodesic deviation equation through a number of consecutive cells between the observer and the source .",
    "in each cell , we can specify the matter distribution governing the deviation . for more details of the method , originally proposed by holz and wald , see @xcite . in inhomogeneous models , there will not be a one - to - one correlation between the redshift and the distance since gravitational lensing will cause a dispersion in the hubble diagram .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma ] shows one simulated data set of angular - diameter distances together with the dr angular - diameter distance for three different values of @xmath0 . using @xmath8-tests , we determine the best - fit @xmath0-value for each of our simulated data sets .",
    "the case closest to the premises of the derivation of the dr distance - redshift relation is the case with one component of the matter density homogeneously distributed and another in very compact objects , e.g. , point - masses .",
    "a perhaps more realistic model of our universe has one part of the total matter density in compact objects and another part in some realistic galaxy dark matter halo model , e.g. , the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile @xcite",
    ". note that the exact parametrization of the galaxy density profile does not significantly affect the results , see @xcite .",
    "we have used three different sets of cosmological parameter values ; one open with @xmath9 and two flat models with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : z1 ] to [ fig : zint ] we present results for @xmath10 with one homogeneous component and one component in point - masses .",
    "distances are calculated for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a distribution of redshifts , @xmath14 .",
    "for all models and redshifts , there is a linear relation between the fraction of the total matter density in point - masses , @xmath1 , and the inhomogeneity - parameter , @xmath4 . in the simulations using",
    "homogeneously distributed matter , we have added the condition that @xmath15 for @xmath16 when fitting the linear function .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : real ] to [ fig : eds ] , results for the more realistic case with one part of the total matter density in point - masses and another in dark matter halos parametrized by the nfw density profile are presented .",
    "distances are calculated in a broad redshift interval @xmath14 .",
    "for light - rays passing far from all point - masses , we expect the best fit value of @xmath0 to be given by @xmath17 where @xmath1 is the fraction of the total matter density in point - masses .",
    "due to the magnification from lensing we expect that on average , @xmath18 . it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : z1]-[fig : zint ] that the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is independent of redshift .",
    "however , from fig .  [",
    "fig : real]-[fig : eds ] , we can see that there is a weak cosmology dependence .",
    "we can understand this effect from the fact that lensing effects should , for a given redshift , be roughly proportional to the distance travelled by the light - ray as well as the mass of the lenses . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zvscell ] , the number of cells traversed in the ray - tracing simulations are presented as a function of redshift for the three different cosmologies used in this paper . since the number of cells is proportional to the distance travelled , we see that the @xmath10 cosmology yields the farthest distance , followed by the @xmath9 and the @xmath11 case .",
    "however , since the mass in lenses is proportional to @xmath19 , we expect that we will have the largest lensing effects for @xmath11 followed by @xmath10 and @xmath9 , as is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : real]-[fig : eds ] .    we can estimate the dispersion in @xmath0 from fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] to be @xmath20 .",
    "however , since we are measuring distances , the dispersion in distance at a given redshift is perhaps of greater interest . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] , the dispersion in @xmath6 for @xmath21 and @xmath10 for @xmath22 , @xmath12 and @xmath23 is shown .",
    "the zero - value corresponds to the value one would obtain in a homogeneous universe , the so called robertson - walker angular - diameter distance , @xmath24 .",
    "the dispersion in angular - diameter distance ( rms ) corresponds to @xmath25 mpc for @xmath22 , @xmath26 mpc for @xmath12 and @xmath27 mpc for @xmath23 .",
    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] that the rw value is within the rms - dispersion in all three cases .",
    "however , since the mean value is displaced from zero , the use of the rw - distance will cause systematic errors of the order @xmath28 mpc for @xmath22 , @xmath29 mpc for @xmath12 and @xmath30 mpc for @xmath23 .",
    "we have investigated the best - fit values of the homogeneity - parameter @xmath0 in the dyer - roeder distance - redshift relation . for a variety of inhomogeneity models , redshifts and cosmological parameter values ,",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and the fraction of compact objects , @xmath1 , is approximately linear and we can parametrize the relation by @xmath31 where @xmath3 .",
    "we expect the dispersion in the angular - diameter distance to be @xmath25 mpc for @xmath22 , @xmath26 mpc for @xmath12 and @xmath27 mpc for @xmath23 in doing this approximation .",
