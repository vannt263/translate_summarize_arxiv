    "the description of the matter content of the cosmos with a single scalar field is appropriate during important epochs of the history of the universe @xcite . in this article , a dynamical system approach to a self - consistent nonsingular cosmological history",
    "is presented in the framework of the classical einstein equations with a nonminimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the complete structure of the phase portrait and of the dynamical behavior is presented for the case of a scalar field conformally coupled to the spacetime curvature and with a quartic self - interaction potential .",
    "this exhaustive analysis is made possible thanks to a reduction of the dynamics to a two - dimensional manifold embedded in the original three - dimensional phase space , a general property show earlier by some of the authors @xcite for a classical scalar field in a spatially flat universe with arbitrary self - interaction potentials and arbitrary coupling to the curvature .",
    "solutions with special dynamical interest are identified , namely heteroclinic and homoclinic solutions in the reduced two - dimensional phase - space , and their relevance to a possible classical birth of the universe from empty space is discussed .",
    "we recall that heteroclinic trajectories in a phase space correspond to bounded solutions connecting two different fixed points . typically , they play the role of separatrices , determining regions of the phase space with qualitative distinct dynamical behaviors .",
    "homoclinic trajectories , on the other hand , correspond to solutions starting and ending at the same fixed point .",
    "their relevance to chaotic motions has been intensively discussed in the literature@xcite . despite the fact that the model presented here has no chaotic behavior , its homoclinic solutions will probably mark candidate regions of the phase space for chaotic motions if a small perturbation to the equations is introduced .",
    "our model consists in a universe filled with a self interacting non - minimally coupled scalar field",
    ". a crucial ingredient of the physics of scalar fields in curved spaces is their nonminimal coupling to the scalar curvature @xmath1 of spacetime , which is required by first loop corrections @xcite , by specific particle theories @xcite , and by scale - invariance arguments at the classical level @xcite .",
    "it is well known that nonminimal coupling dictates the success or failure of inflationary models @xcite ; more generally , it turns out to strongly affect the cosmic dynamics , which is qualitatively richer than in the minimally coupled case .",
    "we show , indeed , that nonminimal coupling leads to new dynamical behaviors , such as a regime that we propose to call _ superinflation _ ( @xmath0 ) , which can not be achieved with minimal coupling @xcite , and spontaneous entry into and exit from inflation , with or without a cosmological constant .",
    "spontaneous superinflation provides a classical alternative to semiclassical birth of the universe from empty minkowski space @xcite , which is impossible with minimal coupling .    in the next section ,",
    "we review our model , recently proposed in @xcite , and give some definitions .",
    "the aspect of the phase portraits are presented in section [ phase ] .",
    "section [ asympt ] is devoted to the asymptotic analyses of some especial solutions .",
    "the last section contains the concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the nonminimally coupled theory described by the action @xmath2 where @xmath1 denotes the scalar curvature , @xmath3 is the scalar field , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being newton s constant ) , and @xmath6 is the nonminimal coupling constant . a cosmological constant @xmath7 , if present , is incorporated in the scalar field potential @xmath8 .",
    "we use the full conserved scalar field stress - energy tensor @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the einstein tensor ) , thereby avoiding the widespread effective coupling @xmath11 in the einstein equations @xmath12 .",
    "we consider here the dynamics of a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe with line element @xmath13 .",
    "this yields the trace equation @xmath14 , the energy constraint @xmath15 ( which guarantees that the energy density @xmath16 ) , and the klein - gordon equation .",

    "the ( time - dependent ) equation of state of the @xmath3 field , rather than being imposed _ a priori _ , follows self - consistently from the dynamics . in the trace equation ( [ trace ] ) , the second derivative @xmath19 that appears in the pressure has been replaced by its expression given by the klein - gordon equation .",
    "clearly , in the set of equations ( [ trace])-([kleingordon ] ) , the sub - system ( [ trace])-([hamiltonianconstraint ] ) is a closed implicit two - dimensional system for @xmath3 and @xmath20 ( note that this dimensional reduction is not possible for spatially curved universes @xcite ) . after solving these implicit equations for @xmath21 and @xmath22",

    "( [ psidot ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath25 is composed of two sheets corresponding to the positive or negative sign in eq .",
    "( [ psidot ] ) .",
    "the two sheets smoothly join on the boundary @xmath28 of the dynamically forbidden region . in the present work , we restrict to the potential [ potential ] v ( ) = ^2 - ^4 - , consisting of a mass term , a quartic self - coupling and , possibly , a cosmological constant term . for consistency with previous works",

    "( [ hamiltonianconstraint ] ) , if @xmath43 and @xmath21 vanish , @xmath42 goes to @xmath44 ) .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by exhaustive numerical simulations@xcite and reported in the following .",
    "we first exclude a cosmological constant by setting @xmath36 .",
    "the phase portrait qualitatively differs according to the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "the minkowski space @xmath47 is a fixed point , attractive for @xmath40 and repulsive for @xmath48 ; the projections of the de sitter spaces @xmath49 are saddle points , i.e. they possess attractive and repulsive eigendirections in the phase space ( fig .",
    "they are of two kinds : expanding ( @xmath50 ) or contracting ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the following solutions , present only in this particular case , [ heteroclinic ] h ( ) = ( ) , = _ 0 ( where @xmath52 is constant ) , correspond to heteroclinic straight lines connecting de sitter fixed points , starting along the repulsive eigendirection of one of them and ending along the attractive eigendirection of the other ( fig .",
    "they are tangent to the boundary of the forbidden regions at @xmath53 . for @xmath54",
    ", another straight line solution is obtained from the general form [ exact ] h ( ) = , = _ 0 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are integration constants .",
    "the nonsingular solutions ( [ heteroclinic ] ) connect a contracting ( @xmath57 ) de sitter regime to a minimum nonvanishing value of the scale factor ( @xmath58 ) , and then to an expanding de sitter regime ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "in addition to these straight lines , we found numerically other heteroclinic solutions : one starting at @xmath60 and ending at @xmath61 , and another one from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "a third solution starts at the expanding de sitter point and goes to infinity , while another one comes from infinity and arrives to the contracting de sitter point .",
    "the phase portrait is symmetric about the origin .    near the fixed point @xmath64",
    ", numerical analysis confirms the peculiar behavior suggested by the lyapunov function : orbits approaching this point with positive @xmath42 are attracted to it , bouncing back and forth infinitely many times off the @xmath28 boundary in the @xmath65 projection ( fig .",
    "3a ) . in the space @xmath66",
    "these orbits are seen to spiral down on a cone towards its apex at the origin .",
    "the cone results from the union of the two sheets in the vicinity of the origin , as it is shown in figure 3 . along the spiral ,",
    "the orbit passes almost periodically from one sheet to the other with period @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is obtained from the asymptotic analysis of the next section . typically , after a few bounces , the period coincides with @xmath69 with good accuracy ) .",
    "a similar behavior for @xmath70 was reported in the earlier numerical analysis of @xcite , but using the effective coupling @xmath71 and the variables @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "= 12.0 cm    in the @xmath48 half - plane , the situation is reversed : orbits starting with @xmath48 are repelled by the origin and depart from it bouncing off the @xmath28 boundary .",
    "the situation ( fig .",
    "3b ) is analogous to the previous one , but now the straight heteroclinic solutions are missing , and are replaced by the solution starting at the contracting de sitter fixed point and escaping to infinity , and by the solution coming from infinity and arriving to the expanding de sitter point .",
    "the two - sheeted structure of @xmath25 implies that no actual intersections occur between different orbits in fig .",
    "3b , which live in different sheets but are projected on the same plane .      as shown in fig .",
    "3c , there are no straight heteroclinic lines but new interesting features emerge",
    ". a new heteroclinic solution appears starting from the origin and ending in the expanding de sitter fixed point . as in the previous case ,",
    "the quadrant @xmath74 , @xmath48 is obtained from the @xmath74 , @xmath40 one by reflection about the @xmath3-axis and time - reversal in fig .",
    "the crucial feature of this case is the appearance of a dense set of homoclinic solutions ( fig .",
    "3d ) departing from the origin with negative @xmath42 and returning to it with positive @xmath42 , going around the forbidden region .",
    "superinflation plays a central role along these orbits ; only a regime with @xmath0 permits the smooth transition from an initial contracting ( @xmath48 ) phase to an expanding one ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this transition occurs at the nonvanishing minimum of the scale factor .",
    "the behavior of this family of homoclinics , as well as of the other solutions , is universal : they rapidly converge in the spiraling region near the origin , irrespective of initial conditions .",
    "since all these homoclinics originate from a neighborhood of the minkowski fixed point due to its own instability with respect to perturbations with @xmath48 , and come back to that point , due to the stability for perturbations with @xmath40 , this behavior constitute a classical alternative to the previously proposed semiclassical birth of the universe from empty space @xcite .      the fixed points ( [ fixedpoints ] ) disappear and the only bounded solutions are the homoclinics associated with the origin ( see fig .",
    "this situation is therefore the most favorable for the classical spontaneous exit from empty minkowski space .",
    "analogous results hold if a small cosmological constant is present ( see figs .",
    "3f ) , with the phase portrait being classified according to @xmath77 , but the fixed point @xmath78 of the @xmath36 case splits into two de sitter fixed points with memory of the previous stability properties .",
    "now , the approximate period between two consecutive bounces is _ bounce= .",
    "for the conformally coupled case , the trace and the klein gordon equations ( [ trace ] ) and ( [ kleingordon ] ) , after a rescaling and the explicit substitution of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamiltonianconstraint ] ) , read @xmath79 we have special interest in the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of ( [ eee ] ) in the vicinity of the attractive fixed points .",
    "let us start with the case @xmath36 . in this case , our region of interest is the neighborhood with @xmath40 of the origin .",
    "we search for asymptotic solutions of the form @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 bounded for large @xmath83 . inserting ( [ asy ] ) in the equations ( [ eee ] ) one has @xmath84 by demanding the exactness of ( [ asy2 ] ) up to @xmath85 order , one gets immediately that @xmath86 is a constant and @xmath87 , leading to @xmath88 which has the general solution f_2 = b(t + ) - ( ( t + ) t - ( t ) ) . in order to guarantee the boundedness of @xmath89 , it is necessary to have @xmath90 . from the equation corresponding to the @xmath91 term in the trace equation",
    ", we have @xmath92 which is solved by g_2 = ( ( t + ) ( t + ) + ) + ( - ) t. again , by requiring the boundedness of @xmath93 for large @xmath83 , we get the condition @xmath94 .",
    "we have , finally , the following asymptotic solution for the @xmath36 case @xmath95 from ( [ asy5 ] ) we can obtain the characteristic period @xmath96 .",
    "also , the asymptotic solution ( [ asy5 ] ) implies that all solutions ending in the origin will behave as matter dominated universes for large @xmath83 , corresponding to @xmath97 .    the case with a small cosmological constant",
    "can be treated analogously , taking into account that now the relevant fixed point is @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the search for asymptotic solutions of the form @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath82 bounded for large @xmath83 , as before , give rise to the equations @xmath102 our asymptotic equations now are considerably more complicated , but , nevertheless , we can obtain an unambiguous period @xmath68 . from ( [ asy22 ] )",
    ", one has that @xmath103 decreases exponentially to the value @xmath104 for large @xmath83 , implying that @xmath105 converge to the form @xmath106 , from which one can obtain @xmath107 .",
    "the scale factor , in this case , obeys @xmath108 for large @xmath83 , as in the de sitter universe .",
    "the @xmath109 plane is divided into sectors by the straight lines @xmath110 , @xmath111 @xmath112 corresponding , respectively , to @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and pressure @xmath115 ( the @xmath42-axis corresponds to @xmath116 ) . the lines @xmath110 mark the transition between inflationary ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) and superinflationary ( @xmath0 ) regimes .",
    "the lines @xmath111 divide regions corresponding to inflation and to decelerated expansion , while @xmath112 divide regions of positive and negative pressures ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the crucial condition for superinflation to occur is that the line @xmath113 ( or parts of it ) should belong to the dynamically accessible region @xmath119 of the @xmath120 plane .",
    "this implies that , for an arbitrary potential @xmath121 , superinflation corresponds to @xmath122 ( this result will be discussed in detail elsewhere ) . for our particular potential ( [ potential ] )",
    ", this requires @xmath123 .",
    "the superinflationary behavior occurs only once along each homoclinic and brings the solution from the primordial minkowski neighborhood to the succession of eras corresponding to different equations of state ( during each bounce ) , towards infinite dilution and equation of state @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , asymptotic analysis for @xmath59 and for any value of @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( with @xmath36 ) shows that the scale factor @xmath126 exhibits oscillations of concavity corresponding to accelerated and decelerated epochs .",
    "these oscillations are damped as @xmath127 ; in this regime , @xmath128 and the universe becomes matter dominated .",
    "while it is not claimed here that the evolution of our universe is modeled by an entire orbit of the system ( [ trace])-([kleingordon ] ) on the accessible manifold @xmath25 , the application to specific eras of the cosmological history is intriguing . indeed , in the bounces reported above ( during which @xmath129 ) , one encounters , respectively , radiation domination crossing the @xmath42-axis , matter domination ( @xmath115 ) , acceleration ( a possible quintessence model ? ) until the next bounce in the @xmath130 projection , where this sequence is reversed .",
    "if we identify one period as our cosmological history , then the reported accelerated expansion of the universe today @xcite suggests to locate our epoch in the sector between the line @xmath131 and the @xmath28 boundary .",
    "the identification of the age of the universe ( @xmath132  s ) with @xmath68 would then yield the scalar field mass @xmath133  ev , which is suggestive of an axion @xcite or of an ultralight pseudo - goldstone boson ( that the quintessence field should be very light was already suggested @xcite ) .    as a step towards a realistic model",
    ", one can include a second scalar field coupled to @xmath3 , which has the meaning of a fundamental field ( as is done , e.g. , in hybrid inflation ) , or mimics a baryonic or other fluid . in spite of the higher dimensionality of the phase space , many of the features exposed here for a single scalar field survive @xcite .",
    "although very simple , we think our classical model opens interesting avenues to the understanding of quintessence in terms of a non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "finally , one should keep in mind that our detailed semi - analytical analyses are possible thanks to the reduction of the original three - dimensional system to a two - dimensional one on a smooth manifold @xmath25 , which , in turn , strongly indicates the absence of chaos ( confirmed by an exhaustive numerical analysis ) .",
    "generically , such a reduction is not possible for the case of a spatially curved spacetime and/or several matter fields non - minimally coupled to the curvature , despite of many similar results .",
