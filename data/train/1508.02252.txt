    "quantum teleportation is a protocol to transfer an unknown qubit from one place to another via an entangled quantum channel @xcite .",
    "it is at the heart of various applications in quantum communication and computation . in particular",
    ", it plays a crucial role in implementing all - optical quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a typical qubit for optical quantum teleportation utilizes the horizontal and vertical polarization states of a single photon , \\{@xmath0 , @xmath1 } @xcite , or alternatively the vacuum and single - photon states , \\{@xmath2 , @xmath3 } @xcite .",
    "however , in this type of approaches based on a single - photon qubit , the success probability of a bell - state measurement , which is an essential element in realizing the quantum teleportation protocol , can not exceed 1/2 using linear optics and photon detection @xcite .",
    "efforts are being made to overcome this limitation using auxiliary states , additional operations or multipartite encoding @xcite while each of them has its own price to pay .",
    "an alternative approach employs coherent states as the qubit basis , \\{@xmath4 , @xmath5 } @xcite , where @xmath6 are amplitudes of the coherent states .",
    "it enables one to implement a nearly deterministic bell - state measurement @xcite .",
    "however , due to the non - orthogonality of two coherent states , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , a necessary operation to finish the teleportation process such as the pauli - z operation can not be performed in a deterministic way and produces additional errors @xcite .",
    "recently , a hybrid approach to optical quantum information processing was proposed by combining advantages of the two aforementioned approaches @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the logical qubit is constructed using entanglement between the polarization states of a single photon and coherent states that leads to nearly deterministic quantum controls @xcite .",
    "it enables one to perform a near - deterministic quantum teleportation as well as near - deterministic universal gate operations in a more efficient manner compared to previous approaches @xcite .",
    "the required resource is hybrid states in the form of @xmath9 @xcite . within this context",
    ", it was shown that such a hybrid entanglement is useful for teleportation between a polarized single - photon qubit and a coherent state qubit @xcite and for a loophole free bell inequality test @xcite . however , it is known that the generation of entanglement between a polarized single photon and coherent states such as @xmath10 is highly demanding @xcite .",
    "there exists a recent theoretical proposal that enables one to efficiently generate the state @xmath10 based on parametric downconversion , linear optics elements , and photodetectors @xcite while it requires preparation of a coherent - state superposition @xcite as a resource . on the other hand ,",
    "the hybrid entanglement of the vacuum and single photon ( instead of single - photon polarization ) with coherent states , such as @xmath11 , was successfully demonstrated in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , a previous study showed that the qubits utilizing the vacuum and single - photon states are more robust against losses compared to the polarized single - photon qubits @xcite .",
    "we therefore need to investigate whether the approach based on the hybrid state in the form of @xmath12 is equivalently useful , or even more useful , compared to the one using state @xmath10 for quantum information processing .    in this paper , in order to compare these two different types of hybrid qubits , we consider implementations of quantum teleportation in a lossy environment .",
    "we analyze the environmental effects caused by photon losses on the entangled channel distributed between two separated parties .",
    "our analysis shows that the quantum teleportation with the hybrid of vacuum and single photon with coherent state is more robust to photon losses than the hybrid of photon polarization with coherent states .",
    "since there are a number of studies on quantum information processing using various kinds of optical hybrid systems @xcite , we first need to clarify the types of optical hybrid qubits that we consider in this paper .",
    "the first one is the hybrid of photon polarization with coherent states , which was originally used to propose the hybrid scheme of optical quantum information processing recently @xcite .",
    "the other is the hybrid of vacuum and single photon with coherent states , which was recently generated by experiments @xcite .",
    "we consider optical hybrid qubits constructed in the logical basis , @xmath13 and the two different types of hybrid qubits are then defined as    * the hybrid of the single - photon polarization with coherent states where @xmath14 , * the hybrid of the vacuum and single photon with coherent states where @xmath15 .",
    "we will refer to the former as _ type - i _ hybrid qubit which is the same form used in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the latter will be referred to as _ type - ii _ hybrid qubit hereafter .",
    "it was shown that using type - i hybrid qubits , quantum teleportation and a universal set of quantum computation can be implemented in a nearly deterministic way using passive linear optics elements and photodetectors @xcite .",
    "this scheme was shown to outperform previous all - optical schemes @xcite when considering together the resource requirements and the fault tolerance limits with photon losses . in principle , the same structure of quantum teleportation and computation schemes can be constructed using type - ii qubits . in the type - ii qubit based approach for quantum teleportation",
    ", however , there are a couple of points to note . in order to complete the quantum teleportation process , the pauli x and pauli z",
    "operations are required . the pauli x operation for a type - ii hybrid qubit in the logical basis ( [ eq : qbasis ] )",
    "can be implemented deterministically by acting the @xmath16-phase shift on each of the two modes . on the other hand ,",
    "a flip between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) is required to perform the pauli - z operation ; this can not be performed deterministically using linear optics elements .",
    "one simple working solution , for the moment , is to `` logically relabel '' the vacuum and the single photon , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , whenever it is necessary . in other words , we know that @xmath2 and @xmath3 remain unaltered , whenever they should be altered , so that it can be logically corrected at the final measurement stage . beside this point , fortunately , if we take the logical qubit basis as the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qbasis ] ) , it is possible to perform the hybrid qubit teleportation with the same success probability with the type - i hybrid qubit @xcite , when there is no loss , and with better success probabilities when photon losses occur . in the following sections",
    ", we will analyze the teleportation protocols and effects of lossy environments for two different types of hybrid qubits in further detail .",
    "in the standard quantum teleportation procedure @xcite , alice is supposed to teleport an arbitrary unknown state @xmath18 to bob via a maximally entangled quantum channel @xmath19 .",
    "alice performs a bell - state measurement on the unknown qubit and her part of the entangled channel , and sends the measurement outcome to bob .",
    "bob applies an appropriate unitary transform on his state depending on alice s measurement outcome in order to reconstruct the original qubit . in an ideal situation ,",
    "quantum teleportation can be carried out with the unit success probability and the teleported state should be exactly the same to the input state . however ,",
    "in realistic implementations , there are factors that reduce the success probability and the teleportation fidelity . here",
    ", we consider two major such factors .",
    "one is inefficiency of the bell - state measurement and the other is photon losses in the quantum channel . in the following subsections , we will calculate and compare the fidelities between the input and the output states and the success probabilities of teleportation for two different types of hybrid qubits .      before considering photon loss effects for teleportation with type - i qubits ,",

    "<S> we investigate the performance of quantum teleportation under a lossy environment using two different types of optical hybrid qubits . </S>",
    "<S> one is the hybrid of the vacuum and single - photon states with coherent states and the other is the hybrid of polarized single - photon states with coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the hybrid qubit using vacuum and single - photon states is generally more robust to photon loss effects compared to the one using the photon polarization with respect to fidelities and success probabilities of quantum teleportation . </S>"
