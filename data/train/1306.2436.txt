    "a topological superconductor has topologically protected gapless edge states , some of which can host majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of edge states in the topological superconductor .",
    "one is a dirac cone , the other is a flat band , namely , dispersionless zero - energy state @xcite",
    ". the dirac cone can be found in the fully gapped topological superconductors when the chern number of the occupied bands is nonzero . however , the flat band can appear in the fully gapped topological superconductors as well as the gapless topological superconductors which , apart from the particle - hole symmetry , have some extra symmetries in the hamiltonian .",
    "such flat bands are known to occur at the zigzag and bearded edge in graphene @xcite , in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor @xcite and in other systems with topologically stable dirac points @xcite .",
    "the flat dispersion implies a peak in the density of states which has a visible experimental signature in the tunneling conductance measurements @xcite .",
    "the zero - bias conductance peak has been observed in recent experiments on the insb nanowire @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite and might be due to the flat bands .    in this paper , we shall investigate the spin - singlet superconductor with the rashba and dresselhaus ( 110 ) spin - orbit couplings .",
    "especially , we focus on the hamiltonian with spin - orbit coupling of dresselhaus ( 110 ) type which is a gapless topological system containing two kinds of edge states mentioned above .",
    "we also apply a magnetic field to the superconductor and consider the zeeman effect .",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian of the superconductor is generically particle - hole symmetric so that we can associate a pfaffian invariant @xmath0 with it as a topological invariant of the system .",
    "the pfaffian invariant @xmath0 can be used in distinguishing the topologically nontrivial phase from the trivial one .",
    "the nontrivial topological phase in this bdg hamiltonian is a majorana type which can be exploited for implementing fault - tolerant topological quantum computing schemes that are inherently decoherence - free @xcite .",
    "all the possible phase diagrams in the bdg hamiltonian are demonstrated in our study .",
    "furthermore , we find that the bdg hamiltonian can have partial particle - hole symmetry and chiral symmetry which can be used to define the one dimensional pfaffian invariant @xmath1 and the winding number @xmath2",
    ". the pfaffian invariant @xmath1 and the winding number @xmath2 can be used in determining the location of the zero - energy majorana flat band .",
    "we show that only when the system has these extra symmetries , the majorana flat band will emerge so that a zero - bias conductance peak in the tunneling conductance measurements can be observed @xcite .",

    ". the spin - orbit couplings can arise from structure inversion asymmetry of a confinement potential ( e.g. , external electric field ) or bulk inversion asymmetry of the underlying crystal ( e.g. , the zinc blende structure ) @xcite .",
