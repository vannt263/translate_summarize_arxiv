    "density functional theory ( dft ) is the most efficient and powerful tool for determining the electronic structure of solids .",
    "while originally developed for continuum electron systems with coulomb interaction,@xcite dft has also been applied to lattice models , such as the hubbard model.@xcite one goal of these studies was to develop new approaches to correlated electron systems : lattice models often allow for exact solutions  either analytically or based on numerics  which hence can serve as benchmarks for assessing the quality of approximations that usually have to be made when using dft . very popular in solid state applications is the local density approximation ( lda ) where the exchange - correlation energy of the inhomogeneous system under consideration is constructed via a local approximation from the homogeneous electron system . amongst others",
    ", lda has been applied to study ultracold fermions in one - dimensional optical lattices,@xcite friedel oscillations in one - dimensional metals,@xcite the mott gap in the hubbard model,@xcite and quantum spin chains.@xcite    for small systems and not too strong interactions , lda in most cases produces reasonable results  which can be obtained with much less numerical effort than needed when using more accurate methods like exact diagonalization or the density matrix renormalization group .",
    "this led to the hope that the lda may serve as a useful tool for large systems , where the numerical effort for the more accurate methods is too expensive .    after recalling in the next section ( sect .",
    "ii ) the theoretical background for the bethe ansatz lda , we will study in detail the lda solution of spinless fermions in one dimension . in sect .",
    "iii we determine the charge susceptibility and discuss , in particular , questions of stability as well as the static and the dynamic response .",
    "then ( sect .",
    "iv ) we study the drude weight ( which can be related to the conductivity ) in the presence of a single impurity , and present our conclusions in the final sect .",
    "v. from the size - dependence of our results , we find that for large systems , lda predictions are qualitatively incorrect even for weak interaction .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional model of spinless fermions described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 creates ( annihilates ) a fermion at site @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the hopping parameter , @xmath4 the nearest - neighbor interaction , and @xmath5 an arbitrary local potential .",
    "the lattice consists of @xmath6 sites ( the lattice constant @xmath7 is set to one ) , and periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the lattice version@xcite of dft relies on the fact that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the potentials @xmath8 and the groundstate expectation values of the site occupations @xmath9 .",
    "therefore it is  in principle  possible to express all quantities that can be obtained from the groundstate wave function as a function ( or functional in the continuous case ) of the densities .",
    "the site occupations as a function of the potentials can , of course , be found from derivatives of the groundstate energy with respect to the local potential , @xmath10 on the other hand , in order to determine the potentials from the densities it is convenient to define the function @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates that the minimization is constrained to such wave functions @xmath13 that yield the given site occupation , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the kinetic and interaction part of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the groundstate energy is obtained by minimizing the function @xmath17 with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "this yields the condition @xmath19 which , of course , is purely formal unless @xmath20 or at least a reasonable approximation for it is available .",
    "a major step towards the practical implementation of dft was the idea of kohn and sham@xcite to employ a non - interacting auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath21 in order to calculate the groundstate density profile . in the present case @xmath22 where the potentials @xmath23 have to be chosen such that in the groundstate of @xmath21 the site occupations @xmath18 are the same as in the interacting model . performing the same steps as before , one obtains the conditions @xmath24 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) yields @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hartree potential , and @xmath27 is the so - called exchange - correlation potential . the minimization problem of dft is thus mapped onto the diagonalization of the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath21 supplemented with the self - consistency condition ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "however , there remains the problem of finding a practical approximation for the exchange - correlation potential @xmath27 .",
    "most dft studies of lattice models have so far relied on the lda where the groundstate energy density @xmath28 of the inhomogeneous system is approximated by the energy density of a homogeneous system at the same density . in the present case",
    "this quantity can be calculated from the bethe ansatz equations;@xcite hence @xmath29_{\\rm lda } =   \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial n_i}\\left(\\epsilon^{\\rm ba}(n_i)-\\epsilon^{\\rm h}(n_i)\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the bethe ansatz energy per site of a homogeneous system with particle density @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the corresponding energy density in hartree approximation .",
    "in order to assess the results based on lda and to discuss their validity , it is appropriate to recall first the phase diagram of the model under consideration . in the homogeneous case and away from half filling one finds for all values of the interaction parameter @xmath33 a luttinger liquid phase , i.e. , there is no long range charge order and the low energy excitations are gapless collective charge excitations . at half filling and for @xmath34",

    "the stability boundary of the homogeneous density profile is determined by the condition that the static susceptibility becomes infinite and changes sign ; this happens whenever the denominator in ( [ eq8 ] ) vanishes , i.e. , for @xmath53 . due to the logarithmic divergence of @xmath49 for @xmath54",
    "this is equivalent to the condition that @xmath55 changes sign .",

    "we investigate the weak interaction case in more detail .",
    "we find @xmath61 so that in first order in the interaction no conclusion about the stability can be drawn : the second order correction to the groundstate energy , @xmath62 , is needed .",
    "numerically we find that its second derivative with respect to the density , @xmath63 , changes sign at @xmath41 , thus limiting the range of stability to @xmath64 at weak coupling .",
    "this result should be contrasted with the hartree approximation ( @xmath65 ) where the homogeneous system is stable only for @xmath66 , i.e. , below quarter and above three quarter filling , and with the exact groundstate where a charge instability of the homogeneous system occurs only at half filling for @xmath67 .",

    "since @xmath68 diverges only logarithmically with system size @xmath6 , the critical interaction strength approaches zero very slowly , @xmath69 . as a consequence , for finite systems and from weak to intermediate interaction strength",
