    "in the course of their study of horn type inequalities for eigenvalues and singular values of complex matrices , fomin , fulton , li , and poon @xcite come up with a very interesting conjecture concerning the schur - positivity of special differences of products of schur functions .",
    "more precisely , they consider differences of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are partitions constructed from an ordered pair of partitions @xmath3 and @xmath4 through a seemingly strange procedure at first glance . in our presentation ,",
    "their transformation @xmath5 on ordered pairs of partitions , will rather be denoted @xmath6 and will be called the @xmath7-operation . as we shall see , this change of notation is essential in order to simplify the presentation of the many nice combinatorial properties of this operation . on the other hand",
    ", it underlines that both entries , @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the image @xmath10 of @xmath11 , actually depend on both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    with this slight change of notation ,",

    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 two partitions with the same number of parts , allowing zero parts . from these",
    ", two new partitions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constructed as follows @xmath16    although this definition does not make it immediately clear , both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are truly partitions , and they are such that @xmath19 where as usual @xmath20 denotes the sum of the parts of @xmath3 .",
    "recall that the product of two schur functions can always be expanded as a linear combination @xmath21 of schur functions indexed by partitions @xmath22 of the integer @xmath23 , since these schur functions constitute a linear basis of the homogeneous symmetric functions of degree @xmath24 .",
    "it is a particularly nice feature of this expansion that the coefficients @xmath25 are always non - negative integers .",
    "they are called the _ littlewood - richardson coefficients_. more generally , we say that a symmetric function is _ schur positive _ whenever the coefficients in its expansion , in the schur function basis , are all non - negative integers . for more details on symmetric function theory see macdonald s classical book @xcite , whose notations we will mostly follow . we can then state the following :    [ fflp ] for any pair of partitions @xmath11 , if @xmath26 then the symmetric function @xmath27 is schur - positive .",
    "in other words , this says that @xmath28 , for all @xmath22 such that @xmath29 appears in the expansion of @xmath30 .    for an example of one of the simplest case of the @xmath7-operation , let @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , be two one - part partitions . in this case",
    ", we get @xmath34 so that conjecture [ fflp ] corresponds exactly to an instance of the classical jacobi - trudi identity : @xmath35 in this paper we give a new recursive combinatorial description of the @xmath7-operation .",

    "in this section we show that the bounded height case of conjecture [ fflp ] can be reduced to checking that it holds for a finite number of pairs , for any given height . in order to do this , and to state our result , we need some definitions .",

    "the last verification that we need to do is that ( [ stabilite ] ) holds .",
    "now , it is clear that the first @xmath40 lines of @xmath455 are all too large for the first part of ( [ gauche ] ) to apply .",
    "in fact , considering the way @xmath40 has been chosen , we see that for @xmath472 @xmath476 this makes it obvious that ( [ stabilite ] ) holds , thus finishing our proof .",
    "we believe that to get a better understanding of the @xmath7-operation , a refined study of its effect on tableaux and semistandard tableaux will be crucial . for instance this should lead to a proof of `` monomial '' versions of conjectures [ fflp ] and [ bergeron ] . more precisely , recall that the expansion of any schur function in the basis of monomial symmetric functions involves only positive integers .",
    "it would thus follow from the conjectures that the expansion of the difference of products considered have positive integer coefficients when expanded in term of monomial symmetric function . in particular",
