    "the unambiguous geometric description of gravitational radiation in curved spacetimes traces back to the work of bondi  @xcite et al , sachs  @xcite and penrose  @xcite . by formulating asymptotic flatness in terms of characteristic hypersurfaces extending to infinity",
    ", they were able to reconstruct , in a nonlinear geometric setting , the basic properties of gravitational waves which had been developed in linearized theory on a minkowski background .",
    "the major new nonlinear features were the bondi mass and news function , and the mass loss formula relating them .",
    "this approach has been implemented as a characteristic evolution code  @xcite which computes the radiation field at infinity by using a penrose compactification of the space - time .",
    "the code computes the gravitational radiation reaching infinity in terms of boundary data supplied on an inner worldtube .",
    "this has timely application to the important astrophysical problem of the inspiral and merger of a binary black hole .",
    "several cauchy codes , using an artificial outer boundary condition , are now able to simulate this binary problem . by using the data on a worldtube carved out of these binary black hole spacetimes obtained by cauchy evolution , the characteristic code can supply the resulting waveform at infinity . in this work ,",
    "we develop and test new methods designed to enhance the accuracy of this approach to computing gravitational waveforms , which has been called _ cauchy - characteristic extraction _",
    "( cce )  @xcite .",
    "the cauchy codes presently being applied to the binary black hole problem introduce an artificial outer boundary , where some boundary condition must be employed .",
    "the choice of the proper boundary condition for an isolated radiating system is a global problem , which can only be treated exactly by an extension of the solution to infinity , e.g. by conformal compactification .",
    "the most elegant such approach is the extension of the cauchy problem to future null infinity @xmath2 by means of a hyperboloidal time foliation  @xcite ( see  @xcite for reviews of progress in this direction ) .",
    "another approach is to extend the solution to @xmath3 by matching the interior cauchy evolution to an exterior characteristic evolution , i.e. cauchy - characteristic matching ( ccm )  @xcite .",
    "( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "ccm has been applied successfully to gravitational wave computations in the linear regime  @xcite but has not yet been extended to the nonlinear binary black hole problem .",
    "when an artificial finite outer boundary is introduced there are two broad sources of error :    * the outer boundary condition * waveform extraction at an inner worldtube .",
    "the first source of error stems from the outer boundary condition , which must lead to a well - posed constraint - preserving initial - boundary value problem .",
    "this has not yet been fully established for any of the present black hole codes .",
    "but , even were such boundary conditions implemented , the correct boundary data must be prescribed .",
    "however , this boundary data can only be exactly determined , in general , by extending the solution to infinity  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the best that can be done is to impose a boundary condition for which _ homogeneous _ boundary data , i.e. zero boundary values , is a good approximation .",
    "one proposal of this type  @xcite is a boundary condition that requires the newman - penrose  @xcite weyl tensor component @xmath4 to vanish . in the limit that the outer boundary goes to infinity",
    "this outer boundary condition becomes exact . in the present state of the art of black hole simulations",
    ", this approach comes closest to a satisfactory treatment of the outer boundary  @xcite .",
    "the second source of error arises from waveform extraction at an inner worldtube , which must be well inside the outer boundary in order to isolate it from errors introduced by the boundary condition .",
    "there the waveform is typically extracted by a perturbative scheme based upon the introduction of a background schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this has been carried out using the regge - wheeler - zerilli  @xcite treatment of the perturbed metric , as reviewed in  @xcite , and also by calculating the newman - penrose weyl component @xmath0 , as first done for the binary black hole problem in  @xcite . in this approach , errors arise from the finite size of the extraction worldtube , from nonlinearities and from gauge ambiguities involved in the arbitrary introduction of a background metric .",
    "the gauge ambiguities might seem less severe in the case of @xmath0 ( vs metric ) extraction , but there are still delicate problems associated with the choices of a preferred null tetrad and preferred worldlines along which to measure the waveform ( see  @xcite for an analysis ) .",
    "cauchy - characteristic extraction , which is one of the pieces of the ccm strategy , offers a means to avoid this error introduced by extraction at a finite worldtube . in cce ,",
    "the inner worldtube data supplied by the cauchy evolution is used as boundary data for a characteristic evolution to future null infinity , where the waveform can be unambiguously computed by geometric methods . by itself",
    ", cce does not use the characteristic evolution to inject outer boundary data for the cauchy evolution , which can be a source of instability in full ccm .",
    "highly nonlinear tests in black hole spacetimes  @xcite have shown that characteristic evolution is a stable procedure which provides the geometry in the neighborhood of null infinity up to numerical error ; and tests in the perturbative regime  @xcite show that cce compares favorably with zerilli extraction and has advantages at small extraction radii .",
    "however , in astrophysically realistic cases which require high resolution , such as the inspiral of matter into a black hole  @xcite , this error has been a troublesome factor in the postprocessing of the numerical solution which is necessary to compute the asymptotic quantities determining the bondi news function .",
    "there are two distinct ways , geometric and numerical , that the accuracy of this calculation of the gravitational waveform might be improved . in the geometrical category ,",
    "one option is to compute @xmath0 instead of the news function as the primary description of the waveform .",
    "we discuss this in sec .",
    "[ sec : waveforms ] , where we develop the extensive formulae necessary to compute the asymptotic @xmath1 part of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath5 , which governs the radiation .    in the numerical category ,",
    "some standard methods for improving accuracy , such as higher order finite difference approximations , would be easy to implement whereas others , such as adaptive mesh refinement , have only been tackled for 1d characteristic codes  @xcite .",
    "but beyond these methods , a major source of error in characteristic evolution arises from the intergrid interpolations arising from the multiple patches necessary to coordinatize smoothly the spherical cross - sections of the outgoing null hypersurfaces .",
    "the development of grids smoothly covering the sphere has had a long history in computational meteorology that has led to two distinct approaches : ( i ) the stereographic approach in which the sphere is covered by two overlapping patches obtained by stereographic projection about the north and south poles  @xcite ; and ( ii ) the cubed - sphere approach in which the sphere is covered by the 6 patches obtained by a projection of the faces of a circumscribed cube  @xcite .",
    "recently , the cubed - sphere approach has received much attention because the simple structure of its shared boundaries allows a highly scalable algorithm for parallel architectures .",
    "a discussion of the advantages of each of these methods and a comparison of their performance in a standard fluid testbed are given in  @xcite .",
    "in numerical relativity , the stereographic method has been reinvented in the context of the characteristic evolution problem  @xcite ; and the cubed - sphere method reinvented in the context of building an apparent horizon finder  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic evolution code was first developed using two square stereographic patches , each overlapping the equator .",
    "we consider here a modification , based upon the approach advocated in  @xcite , which retains the original stereographic patch structure but shrinks the overlap region by masking a circular boundary near the equator .",
    "recently , the cubed - sphere method has also been developed for application to characteristic evolution  @xcite .",
    "these geometric and numerical considerations lead to four options for improving cce :    * computation of the news function using circular stereographic patches * computation of the weyl tensor using circular stereographic patches * computation of the news function using the cubed - sphere patching * computation of the weyl tensor using cubed - sphere patching    we compare these options here in the context of model problems designed to test their application to cce . because the cubed - sphere approach requires further code development to be applied to cce , in sec .",
    "[ sec : stests ] we present a test based upon the propagation of a wave on the sphere to provide a preliminary comparison with the stereographic approach .",
    "the test compares their accuracy in calculating the angular derivatives required in the news and weyl tensor extraction algorithms . in sec .",
    "[ sec : extraction ] , we next present tests of cce which compare the news and weyl tensor approaches in a linearized gravitational wave test problem .    the development of finite - difference evolution algorithms , which was largely motivated by application to computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) .",
    "it has utilized the method of lines , where a 3-dimensional spatial domain is discretized to yield a set of coupled ordinary differential equations in time for the grid values , which are then integrated , e.g. by a runge - kutta procedure .",
    "this @xmath6 approach is not applicable to the @xmath7 format of characteristic evolution considered here , in which the discretization of a 2-dimensional spherical set of characteristics leads to coupled 2-dimensional partial differential equations in the plane spanned by the outgoing and ingoing characteristics .",
    "this @xmath7 approach is natural to general relativity since the characteristics ( light rays ) are fundamental to describing the dynamical geometry of space - time",
    ". it would be impractical in cfd in which the characteristics have a complicated dynamic relation ( determined by equations of state ) to the fixed euclidean geometry . as a result",
    ", characteristic evolution algorithms were developed only recently in the context of general relativity and there has been relatively little analysis of their computational properties .",
    "in particular , for cfd or any symmetric hyperbolic system , numerical dissipation can be added in the standard kreiss - oliger form  @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is to show how analogous dissipation can be successfully applied in a @xmath7 format . in the original version of the pitt code , which used square stereographic patches with boundaries aligned with the grid ,",
    "numerical dissipation was only introduced in the radial direction  @xcite .",
    "this was sufficient to establish numerical stability . in the new version of the code with circular",
    "stereographic patches , whose boundaries do not fit regularly on the stereographic grid , numerical dissipation is necessary to control the high frequency error introduced by the intergrid interpolations , as previously noted in the treatment of a fluid problem using circular stereographic patches  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the formalism underlying the characteristic evolution code in sec .",
    "[ sec : chform ] and show how the essential new feature of angular dissipation can be incorporated .",
    "the two spherical grid methods , stereographic and cubed sphere , are briefly described in sec .",

    "[ sec : stests ] and [ sec : extraction ] and we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the characteristic formalism is based upon a family of outgoing null hypersurfaces , emanating from some inner worldtube , which extend to infinity where they foliate @xmath3 into spherical slices .",
    "we let @xmath8 label these hypersurfaces , @xmath9 @xmath10 be angular coordinates which label the null rays and @xmath11 be a surface area coordinate . in the resulting @xmath12 coordinates ,",
    "the metric takes the bondi - sachs form  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a unit sphere metric . in analyzing the einstein equations",
    ", we also use the intermediate variable @xmath17    the code introduces an auxiliary unit sphere metric @xmath16 , with associated complex dyad @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 . for a general bondi - sachs metric , @xmath20 can then be represented by its dyad component @xmath21 , with the spherically symmetric case characterized by @xmath22 .",
    "the full nonlinear @xmath20 is uniquely determined by @xmath23 , since the determinant condition implies that the remaining dyad component @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "we also introduce spin - weighted fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as well as the ( complex differential ) operators @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "refer to  @xcite for further details .    in this formalism",
    ", the einstein equations @xmath30 decompose into hypersurface equations , evolution equations and conservation conditions on the inner worldtube . as described in more detail in  @xcite ,",
    "the hypersurface equations take the form @xmath31 where  @xcite @xmath32 is the curvature scalar of the 2-metric @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution equation takes the form @xmath33 where , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are nonlinear terms which vanish for spherical symmetry .",
    "expressions for these terms as complex spin - weighted fields and a discussion of the conservation conditions are given in  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic evolution code implements this formalism as an explicit finite difference scheme . in this paper",
    "we use second order accurate finite differences and we reduce all angular derivatives to first order by the introduction of auxiliary variables , as described in  @xcite      it is a feature of the composite mesh technique that numerical dissipation is necessary to stabilize the error introduced by intergrid interpolations . in the case of a square stereographic patch , whose boundary aligns with the grid lines , the dissipation built into the characteristic radial integration scheme is sufficient for this purpose  @xcite . however , because a circular boundary fits into a stereographic grid in an irregular way , angular dissipation is also necessary in order to suppress the resulting high frequency error introduced by the interpolations between stereographic patches .    we accomplish this by modifying the evolution equation ( [ eq : wev ] ) as follows . in the code ,",
    "( [ eq : wev ] ) is expressed in terms of a compactified radial coordinate @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an adjustable scale parameter and @xmath3 has finite coordinate value @xmath41 .",
    "the evolution in retarded time @xmath8 is carried out in terms of the variable @xmath42 , which is regular at @xmath3 .",

    "this leads to @xmath51 integration over the unit sphere with solid angle element @xmath52 then gives @xmath53 thus the @xmath54-term has the effect of damping high frequency noise as measured by the @xmath55 norm of @xmath56 over the sphere .",
    "similarly , dissipation is introduced in the radial integration of ( [ eq : phiev ] ) through the substitution @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "angular dissipation is also introduced in the hypersurface equations through the substitutions @xmath59",
    "for an analytic treatment of the penrose compactification of an asymptotically flat space - time , it is simplest to introduce an inverse radial coordinate @xmath60 , so that future null infinity @xmath3 is given by @xmath61  @xcite . in the resulting @xmath62",
