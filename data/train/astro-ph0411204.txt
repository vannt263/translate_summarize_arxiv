    "the counting of galaxies as a function of apparent magnitude is one of the most powerful tools in observational cosmology . not only can this simple statistic form strong constraints on the level of evolution at the faint end , but also on the large - scale structure and the scales to which the cosmological principle can be said to hold from bright magnitude counts .    the apm galaxy survey @xcite produced number counts which are unexpectedly low for the solid angle surveyed ( @xmath14000 deg@xmath2 ) .",
    "the question then arises : to what extent are these steep counts due to real clustering in the galaxy distribution , and do errors in the photomotery or strong evolution at low redshifts contribute significantly to the observed deficiency ? if the counts were exclusively due to an under - density in the southern galactic cap ( sgc ) , it would be unexpectedly large and deep for our present understanding of large - scale structure",

    "the observed deficiency is calculated with respect to the @xcite model , the best fit and 1@xmath4 lower limit best fit normalisations of this model described in section 3.1 , and the mean 2mass @xmath65 number density ( @xmath68 ) . in the first three cases",
    ", the observed counts represent an extremely rare fluctuation from that expected by @xmath3cdm .",
    "if the @xcite model is effectively lowered by 2.5@xmath4 with respect to the faint @xmath5-band data to the mean 2mass number density , then the observed counts begin to become more consistent with a @xmath3cdm form of the correlation function . therefore , unless the faint @xmath5-band data are systematically too high or the galaxy distribution in the sgc is an extremely rare fluctuation in the galaxy density , then the @xmath0-band counts over the apm survey area appear to imply an excess of power at large scales over the @xmath3cdm prediction .",
    "our second technique is therefore to examine the large - scale power in the 2mass catalogue through a determination of the galaxy angular power spectrum .",
    "we compare this to a @xmath3cdm prediction determined from the hubble volume simulations .",
    "the two are in reasonable agreement although there is some discrepancy in the slopes ; taking a @xmath0-band bias of @xmath76=1.1 @xcite results in a @xmath85 excess over the mean @xmath3cdm angular power spectrum at large scales ( @xmath7730 ) . in order to determine the effect of this apparent excess on the significance",
    "estimates used previously , we transform the angular power spectrum to the angular correlation function via a bessel function transform .",
    "the corresponding best fit to the 2mass angular correlation function at large scales ( @xmath81 ) decreases the significance estimates by 0.5@xmath4 compared to the @xmath3cdm angular correlation function used previously .",
    "therefore while there appears to be an excess of power at large scales in the 2mass catalogue over the @xmath3cdm hubble volume simulation , it is not enough to account for the observed deficiency in the apm survey area .",
    "one caveat to this is that the mock 2mass catalogues are constructed such that the mean galaxy density agrees with that of the @xmath65 2mass sample .",
    "if , as might be inferred from the low cap counts in fig .  [ fig : apm ] , the local galaxy distribution was globally under - dense with respect to the faint @xmath5-band counts , then the corresponding significance estimates would change due to the fact that the 2mass correlation function is not drawn from a fair sample of the universe .",
    "our third technique is to use a 2-dimensional counts in cells analysis on the 2mass catalogue and also the unbiased and biased mock 2mass catalogues constructed from the @xmath3cdm hubble volume simulation ( again normalised to the mean 2mass galaxy density ) .",
    "this enables us to verify the significance estimates used previously , and also that the form of real features in the galaxy distribution are reproduced by the @xmath3cdm hubble volume simulation at large scales .",
    "the biased mock catalogues reproduce the observed galaxy distribution to very large scales ( 30@xmath7 ) .",
    "this supports the significance calculation determined previously ( with respect to the mean 2mass number density ) which indicates that the local hole is not a challenge to @xmath3cdm if the @xmath75 2mass catalogue is a fair sample of the universe .    in conclusion ,",
    "the issue of the large local hole in the local galaxy distribution has yet to be resolved .",
    "the 2mass @xmath0-band number counts extracted for the @xmath14000 deg@xmath2 apm survey area indicate a clear deficiency in the local galaxy distribution consistent with the form of the @xmath13 in the much smaller 2dfgrs southern strip .",
    "however , to determine the level of the deficiency in the galaxy distribution requires an accurate normalisation of the @xmath5-band number count model . using the @xcite model , which provides an excellent fit to faint @xmath5-band data compiled from the literature in the range 14@xmath5018 , implies a deficiency over the apm survey area which is at odds with @xmath3cdm and a local galaxy distribution which is globally under - dense .",
    "only if the model is lowered by 3.8@xmath4 below the faint @xmath5-band data can the normalisation account for the low counts over the apm survey area .",
    "the large increase in faint @xmath5-band data from the uk infra - red deep sky survey should help to resolve this issue .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the 2 micron all - sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis centre / california institute of technology , funded by the aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "we thank adrian jenkins and carlton baugh for their assistance with the hubble volume mock catalogues and useful discussion .",
    "we also thank tom jarrett for his help with the 2mass magnitudes .",

    "<S> we investigate the large - scale structure of the local galaxy distribution using the recently completed 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) via three techniques . </S>",
    "<S> first , we determine the @xmath0-band number counts over the @xmath14000  deg@xmath2 apm survey area where evidence for a large - scale ` local hole ' has previously been detected and compare them to a homogeneous prediction . considering a @xmath3cdm form for the 2-point angular correlation function , </S>",
    "<S> the observed deficiency represents a 5@xmath4 fluctuation in the galaxy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we check the model normalisation using faint @xmath5-band data compiled from the literature ; the normalisation used in this paper is in excellent agreement , and the observed counts over the apm survey area would require the model to be lowered by 3.8@xmath4 . however , the issue is complicated by the @xmath620@xmath7 and @xmath8 - 20@xmath7 2mass counts which lie below the best - fit model normalisation . </S>",
    "<S> second , since the @xmath0-band counts over the apm survey area continue to suggest the possible presence of excess clustering over the @xmath3cdm prediction , we next probe the power at large scales by comparing the 2mass and @xmath3cdm mock galaxy angular power spectra . we find a @xmath9 excess in the 2mass catalogue over the @xmath3cdm prediction at large scales ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this excess is not enough to account for the low counts over the apm survey area . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in order to probe more directly whether the @xmath3cdm mocks can reproduce observed features in the galaxy distribution at large scales , we apply a counts in cells analysis to the 2mass data and mock catalogues ; on the assumption that the 2mass catalogue at @xmath11 is representative , we find excellent agreement between the biased @xmath3cdm mocks and the 2mass catalogue to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of the interpretation of these results appears to be whether the 2mass volume is yet big enough to constitute a fair sample of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the number count models based on fainter counts suggest that it may not be , although normalisation uncertainties remain . </S>",
    "<S> it is also the case that the 2mass depth remains comparable to the possible size of large - scale inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> analyses which assume the 2mass average density is a fair sample , such as counts in cells and to a lesser extent , power spectral analysis , may return results which see less contradiction with @xmath3cdm than the number count analysis in the apm survey area . further progress on assessing the significance of the local hole and thus the consistency of the local galaxy distribution with @xmath3cdm will require deeper all - sky number counts and redshift surveys in both the optical and the infrared .
