    "initially , the tristan project was aimed at finding the  top \" quark @xcite .",
    "although only a three - km circumstance was available , we achieved a maximum beam energy of 33 gev .",
    "unfortunately , the top mass was far beyond this energy @xcite .",
    "we , thus , converted our target to a high - luminosity operation of this collider .",
    "figure [ luminosity ] shows the relationship between the beam energies and luminosities for various accelerators .    -1 cm -1 cm    assuming that cleo and lep are standard , we can see why tristan is a high - luminosity machine .",
    "we hope that the same thing occurs in the near - future b - factory @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", we ( topaz , venus , and amy ) obtained @xmath2 of 300pb@xmath3 per each experiment at @xmath4=58 gev .    if there is a process having a cross section that is an increasing function of @xmath4 , that may be a big target until the b - factory starts .",
    "@xmath0 physics is one of them .",
    "the luminosity function ( @xmath5 ) is roughly proportional to log(@xmath6 ) . as a result",
    ", tristan becomes the highest luminosity @xmath0-factory , except for the low @xmath7 region , where cesr still gives the highest @xmath0 yield .",
    "therefore , cesr has been fitted for resonance physics , and tristan is for parton physics . for a higher @xmath7 region ( @xmath8 gev ) , we have obtained the largest statistics ; this situation will remain forever .",
    "tristan can play an important role in particle physics , especially regarding strong interactions .",
    "here , we briefly mention the @xmath0 processes . figure [ feynman ] shows four typical diagrams which contribute to these .",
    "\\(a ) is called a  direct process \" , where photons interact with quarks via point - like interactions @xcite .",
    "the vector - meson dominance process ( vdm ) is shown in ( b ) @xcite .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are called the  resolved - photon process \" , where partons inside photons interact point - like @xcite . ( a ) contributes to high-@xmath9 production of quarks , ( b ) to a low @xmath9 , and ( c ) , ( d ) to a medium @xmath9 . considering our sensitivity over the @xmath7 range , in addition to our trigger system ability @xcite , we can study ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) at most accurate levels .",
    "to conclude , we are sensitive for @xmath1-structure studies , especially concerning the partonic structure of the photon , in addition to higher order of qcd ( or strong interaction ) .",
    "the most important topic is to determine the gluonic densities inside photons .",
    "this is the cleanest way to determine the @xmath1-structure in contrast with ep collisions at hera experiments .",
    "three groups ( topaz , venus , and amy ) were operating at tristan . among them",
    ", we pay special attention to the topaz experiments , because of having low - angle calorimeters .",
    "the apparatus of the topaz detector is shown in figure [ topaz ] @xcite .",
    "-1 cm    the central tracker is a tpc , which enables us to study heavy flavor productions .",
    "topaz is the only detector having low - angle calorimeters ( fcl)@xcite . this covers a polar angle region from 3.2 to 12 degrees with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the mean beam energy(@xmath10 ) of tristan was 29 gev . when we select events with an energy deposit of 0.4@xmath10 ( beam - electron tag ) , the @xmath11 for the photon is greater than 1.05 gev@xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the beam - electron tag , we have introduced a  remnant - jet - tag \" . as shown in figures [ feynman ] ( c ) and ( d ) , hadron jets which are resolved form photons flow into beam directions .",
    "typically , hadrons from these jets have @xmath9 s of about 0.4 gev .",
    "assuming that these hadrons have energies of several gev , they hit the fcl fiducial region .",
    "the energy flow in typical @xmath13 events are shown in figure [ remjet ] .",
    "it has enhancements at low - angle regions which can not be explained by the processes shown in figures [ feynman ] ( a ) nor ( b ) .",
    "the energy deposits in the fcl are also shown in figure [ fclhad ] .",
    "-1 cm -1 cm    the soft component corresponds to these resolved - photon events .",
    "we can , therefore , tag the resolved - photon process by selecting a soft energy deposit in the fcl .",
    "the efficiency of this tagging was estimated to be @xmath1480% with a background of 10% , mostly due to the beam background .",
    "we call this  remnant - jet - tag \" , or  rem - tag \" in short .",
    "as has been described , various processes contribute to @xmath0 collisions ; the analysis ways are not unique . according to a historical method ,",
    "hadron system at the cms frame were divided into two hemispheres ( definition of jets ) .",
    "this method has an advantage for analyzing events in all @xmath9 regions .",
    "amy showed evidence for a resolved - photon process by this method @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out by topaz , and the @xmath15 distribution is shown in figure [ evshape ] ( a ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath15=2.5 gev , the data excess is by a factor of 2.5 compared with the incoherent sum of direct and vdm processes .",
    "this excess has been explained by the resolved - photon process .",
    "next , the thrust distribution of high @xmath15 ( @xmath162.5 gev ) events are plotted in figure [ evshape ] ( b ) .",
    "the events are spherical , consistent with the prediction by the resolved - photon processes .",
    "similar results have been obtained by the lep experiments @xcite .",
    "the processes shown in figures [ feynman ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) include hard scattering of partons which are observed as jets ( figure [ jet ] ) .",
    "these jets are reconstructed in @xmath17 and @xmath18 plane .",
    "the particles within the circle @xmath19 are used .",
    "figure [ jetcross ] is the cross section of jet production versus @xmath15 .",
    "the cross section is consistent with the incoherent sum of the direct and resolved - photon processes at the @xmath202gev region ( the same result as the previous one ) .",
    "the theoretical models , called lac1 , lac3 , and dg , shown in the figure have significant differences in the gluon distribution inside the photon @xcite the hard - gluon model ( lac3 ) is clearly rejected .",
    "lac1 and dg show difference at low - x gluonic - density , and it is difficult to distinguish them by this experimental method @xcite .",
    "a similar result was obtained by amy @xcite .",
    "the photon structure function ( @xmath21 ) was measured by the topaz collaboration @xcite .",
    "we obtained a high value compared with the theoretical values at x@xmath140.04 at @xmath22 gev@xmath12 .",
    "these regions are important for determining the qcd - based models . although the experimental ambiguities in determining x value from the mass of the measured hadronic system were found to be large , and there will be a systematic shift .",
    "we are , therefore , going to reanalyse the data using a new algorithm to determine x while assuming missing - energy flow directions ( i.e. , beam - pipe direction ) .",
    "according to a qcd calculation of parton - parton scattering , the cut - off parameter ( @xmath23 ) was introduced for light - quark scattering .",
    "this parameter must be determined experimentally ; the optimum value was obtained to be around 1.7@xmath142 gev .",
    "fortunately , for the charm - quark case , this parameter is not necessary , and we can experimentally select charm - pair events with high purity .",
    "in addition , the vdm effects are considered to be small for charmed - particle production . in the resolved - photon processes we only have to consider gluon - gluon scattering ; therefore , this is sensitive to the gluonic density in which a large model dependence exists .",
    "the nlo calculations are available at the parton level @xcite .",
    "initial charm quark fragment to @xmath25 mesons .",
    "@xmath26 is the most probable state .",
    "this fragmentation function is experimentally well known .",
    "we can , therefore , estimate the initial charm quarks @xmath9s .",
    "we first tried to reconstruct @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 @xmath26s were reconstructed with a good s / n ratio .",
    "the obtained cross section is plotted in figure [ dstarcrs ] by open circles .",
    "-1 cm -1 cm    although this cross section is higher than the sum of the direct and resolved- photon predictions , the statistics are low .",
    "the nlo effect was taken into account in the prediction .",
    "we used lac1 for the gluonic density in photons .    in order to improve the experimental accuracy",
    ", we carried out a  softpion analysis \" in reconstructing the @xmath26s .",
    "the results are also shown in figure [ dstarcrs ] by the open circles .",
    "they are consistent with that of the full reconstruction .",
    "the high @xmath9 anomaly still existed , and the hypothetical @xmath29 pair assumption was tested by looking at the event shapes @xcite .",
    "these shapes differ from @xmath29-pair prediction and rather resemble the typical @xmath0 events .",
    "the similar high @xmath9 anomaly was also reported by the amy collaboration @xcite .",
    "the maximum integrated luminosity of the tristan experiment is 300pb@xmath3 and now most of them were analyzed .",
    "we must , therefore , seek other ways of analysis than waiting for an increase in data .",
    "an inclusive analysis of the strange particle is one of them .",
    "the @xmath9 spectrum of these reflect that of charm quarks . also , strange - quark pair production is strongly suppressed in @xmath0 collisions .    in the @xmath30",
    "inclusive analysis , we introduced  remnant - jet - tag \" @xcite .",
    "the details were described in the previous section .",
    "we can , therefore , derive the cross sections process by process .",
    "these are shown in figures [ kscrs ] ( a ) and ( b ) .    here , we could not separate the vdm and the resolved - photon events , because of the low-@xmath9 particle production by the vdm .    by this study , the existing theory plus the lac1 parametrization with the nlo correction",
    "well describe the experimental data .",
    "we further tested the parametrization difference in the gluon density by using the whit parameterization @xcite .",
    "this gave six systematic parametrizations .",
    "some combinations of these with various @xmath23 cut - offs , fitted the experimental data perfectly .",
    "the electron inclusive method is a cleaner one than the inclusive @xmath31 .",
    "here , we do not have to consider the vdm .",
    "the topaz detector can identify very low @xmath9 electrons , such as 0.4 gev @xcite .",
    "we can , therefore , measure the gluon density at very low - x ( @xmath140.02 ) , where the model differences appears . figure",
    "[ elect ] ( a ) is the differential cross section versus the electron @xmath9s .",
    "the experimental data clearly favor the lac1 parametrization , also suggesting the necessity of the nlo correction and a low charm - quark mass of @xmath14 1.3 gev @xcite . although venus produced a similar result , the statistics were about half that of ours @xcite .",
    "we carried out  remnant - jet - tag \" , and obtained purely  resolved - photon \" cross section ( figure [ elect ] ( b ) ) .",
    "again , it confirmed our parametrization of the theory .",
    "we also observed a large difference between the dg and lac1 .",
    "this is because this method is sensitive to very low - x regions where the jet analysis could not resolve .",
    "note that this method is more powerful than the single tag experiment ( @xmath21 ) in determining the gluon density inside photons .    in figure",
    "[ elect ] ( a ) at highest @xmath9 region , there are some excesses compared with the existing theory .",
    "a similar high @xmath9 excess was observed by amy @xcite .",
    "so far what we have learned is that there are some high @xmath9 excess in charm production , and that the experimental results at low @xmath9 agree with the existing theory with the nlo correction and high gluonic density at low x. we investigated the @xmath32-inclusive cross section in order to qualitatively study the nlo effects .",
    "@xmath32s can also tag charm - pair events the same as in the @xmath31 case .",
    "in addition , there is an experimental fact that a gluon - jet produces more @xmath32s than does a quark jet @xcite .",
    "our experimental results are shown in table [ lamratio ] @xcite .    .",
    "total cross section ( pb ) of @xmath33 in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 gev range .",
    "the notation ( -vdm ) means vdm subtraction using theory .",
    "here , we use the lo theories in order to show the discrepancy with the experimental data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are process - independent excesses compared with the prediction of the lo theories .",
    "the values are a factor of two .",
    "we can , therefore , conclude that there exists significant gluon jet production in @xmath0 collisions , i.e. , the nlo effect .",
    "we carried out a double - tag analysis , and obtained the total hadronic cross sections @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 ranges for @xmath36 was 2@xmath1425 gev@xmath12 and the @xmath37 range was 2@xmath1425 gev .",
    "figure [ dtratio ] is the ratio of the cross sections ( @xmath38 ) between the experiment and the lo @xmath39 theory .",
    "the experimental value agrees with the lo prediction in the high-@xmath11 region .",
    "there are enhancements of @xmath1430% in the low-@xmath11 region , suggesting nlo effects .",
    "our experimental data strongly favor a large gluon density at low x , as has been suggested by lac1 .",
    "however , the hera experiment ( ep collision ) showed a lower gluon density than that which lac1 predicted @xcite .",
    "also , the lep experiment is inconsistent with lac1 at low x @xcite .",
    "the problem is whether we can explain all of the experimental data by simply changing the parton density functions .",
    "in addition , the high @xmath9 excess in charm production can not be solved by any existing theories .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath0 collision increases with energy in a future @xmath40 linear collider experiment .",
    "it would be a large background , and may be related to such physics as @xmath41 searches . in order to reliably estimate the background , our measurement greatly helps .",
    "systematic measurements , such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are necessary .",
    "at the tristan @xmath40 collider , a systematic study of hadronic @xmath0 collisions was carried out .",
    "tristan is a high - luminosity @xmath0 factory , and our data of these processes have the largest statistics . for parton production",
    "our data greatly contributed to our experimental and theoretical understanding of photon structures .",
    "further systematic measurements on various processes are awaited .",
