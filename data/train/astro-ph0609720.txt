    "the detection and analysis of large samples of cool white dwarfs over the past decade has led to a significant improvement in our knowledge of the chemical composition and evolution of their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the difficulties in interpreting the spectra of some very cool white dwarfs thought to posses helium - rich atmospheres with small amounts of h @xcite are most probably related to the extreme physical conditions found in their atmospheres @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical conditions in hydrogen - rich atmospheres are much less extreme and the current models should be much more reliable . nonetheless , models systematically overestimate the flux for @xmath2  of hydrogen - rich white dwarfs of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon could be the pseudo - continuum bound - free opacity from hydrogen atoms perturbed by collisions in a relatively dense medium .",
    "however , a realistic calculation of this opacity source shows that it is too weak to correct the observed blue flux excess in the models @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the possibility that the missing opacity is the red wing of the pressure broadened hydrogen lyman@xmath4 line .",
    "this absorption mechanism results from the perturbations of hydrogen atoms by their interaction with other particles , primarily @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "such perturbations result in the lowering of the @xmath1 transition energy and the possibility of a bound - bound transition for photon energies that are smaller than that of an isolated hydrogen atom ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we present a new , semi - classical calculation of this process based on accurate quantum mechanical calculations and a model that has no free parameters .",
    "the inclusion of broadening by collisions with @xmath6 is the key element of this calculation .",
    "the resulting pure hydrogen models successfully reproduce the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) and colors of very cool da and dc white dwarfs .",
    "we are interested in the @xmath1 opacity far from the line center , at wavelengths @xmath8 .",
    "a lowering of the @xmath1 transition energy by more than @xmath9 is required for a bound - bound absorption from the ground state of hydrogen atom at these wavelengths .",
    "this can occur in rare , close - range collisions that strongly perturb the bound states of the atom . because the ground state interactions are strongly repulsive at short range , the probability of such close - range collisions is much smaller than unity .",
    "multi - particle collisions that result in a similar decrease in the @xmath1 transition energy are therefore insignificant @xcite and we consider the interaction between a @xmath5 atom and its closest neighbor only . this approach was used to successfully explain the complex shape of the lyman @xmath10 line wings detected in the spectra of white dwarfs with @xmath11 @xcite , the uv flux deficiency observed in the white dwarf star @xmath12 @xcite , and to model resonance broadening of the @xmath1 line in the solar spectrum @xcite .    for a given colliding",
    "pair , the change in the @xmath1 transition energy results from the formation of a temporary dimer , whose first transition energy @xmath13 differs from that of an isolated hydrogen atom , @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath13 is given by the differences in the energies of the ground state and first excited rydberg state of a @xmath5-perturber dimer calculated at a fixed inter - particle separation @xmath15 : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency of the absorbed photon .",
    "this picture is in the spirit of the franck - condon principle , which states that the nuclei remain in fixed positions during a radiative transition @xcite .",
    "the differential probability of finding such a dimer with an inter - particle separation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a number density of perturbers , @xmath22 is the interaction energy between a hydrogen atom and the perturber localized at the position @xmath23 in relation to the hydrogen atom .",
    "the potential for the interaction of a hydrogen atom with h ( @xmath24 dimer ) is from @xcite and that for perturbations by h@xmath25 ( @xmath26 dimer ) is from @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for the @xmath27 dimer ,",
    "the allowed bound - bound transition from the ground state with the smallest transition energy ( i.e. greatest broadening ) at all values of @xmath18 is from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "satellite features @xcite do not appear for this transition because the difference between the two energy curves has no extrema ( fig .",
    "contributions from transitions to other excited levels of the @xmath27 dimer ( such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) are negligible in the far red wing ( @xmath32 ) because they always lie above the @xmath33 state by at least 2.5@xmath34ev in the relevant range of @xmath18 and hence only provide absorption for photons with higher energies than the @xmath33 state . for the same reason , transitions from the binding @xmath27 ground state ( @xmath35 ) are also negligible in the far red wing .",
    "we use the @xmath36 energy curve from @xcite . for the energy of the first excited rydberg state of the @xmath26 system",
    ", we used the h@xmath37 calculations of @xcite . to obtain the h ",
    "h@xmath25 potential from the h@xmath37 potential surface , we assumed a fixed internuclear separation for @xmath6 of @xmath38 this approach is justified by the fact that the atoms in @xmath6 vibrating in the ground state spend most of the time at the equilibrium internuclear separation . at the temperatures of interest ( @xmath39k ) ,",
    "the vibrational excitation is small , and so is the amplitude of vibration ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we have verified that such a small change in the intermolecular separation does not affect our results significantly .",
    "the line profile is calculated in the quasi - static approximation , which is suitable for a calculation of the far line wings perturbed by classical particles @xcite .",
    "the profile of the line @xmath41 is given by ( @xcite , eqs .",
    "13 & 61 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath18-dependent transition dipole moment between the ground state and the first excited rydberg state of the colliding pair , and @xmath44 is the frequency .",
    "the dipole transition moments , which vary with separation @xmath18 , are from @xcite for @xmath27 and @xcite for @xmath26 . for a given @xmath1 transition energy ,",
    "the @xmath26 ground state interaction is much less repulsive than the @xmath27 ground state interaction ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and the probability of a close @xmath26 interaction is much larger than that of a close @xmath27 interaction ( @xmath45 ) . hence ,",
    "the @xmath26 collisions are the dominant contributors to the @xmath1 line red wing opacity in the atmospheres of cool h - rich white dwarfs with a significant abundance of @xmath6 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "bpm 4729 ( wd 0752@xmath47676 ) is the only cool da white dwarf observed in the near uv @xcite . when complemented with the bvrijhk photometry of @xcite and the u magnitude @xcite the complete spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this cool white dwarf",
    "is obtained .",
    "the uv spectrum extends well into the wing of the @xmath1 line and thus provides an excellent measure of the strength and profile of the line .",
    "our fit of a pure h model ( @xmath48k , @xmath49 ) to the entire sed of bpm 4729 is excellent ( fig .",
    "these values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 agree with the values of @xcite at the @xmath52 level .",
    "the high quality of the fit of the uv spectrum demonstrates the validity of our model for the far red wing of the @xmath1 line under the conditions encountered in bpm 4729 . at the photosphere ,",
    "the composition is @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number density in @xmath56 . despite the lower abundance of @xmath6",
    ", it is an important contributor to the @xmath1 line opacity in the far red wing ( fig .",
    "2 ) . @xcite obtained a good fit of the uv and blue spectrum with a he - rich model with @xmath57 .",
    "they point out that such a low h abundance fails to reproduce the balmer lines of bpm 4729 , however .",
    "@xcite required a large amount of @xmath58 to match the uv spectrum because the broadening of ly @xmath59 by collisions with he is weaker than with h or h@xmath25 .",
    "they also considered a pure hydrogen model but its ly @xmath59 line extends only up to @xmath60 . in view of the difference between the potential curves for the @xmath61 to @xmath62 states of the @xmath27 dimer ( fig .",
    "1 ) this indicates that this particular transition was not included in the model of @xcite .",
    "the main reason for our success with a pure h model is our inclusion of the broadening of @xmath1 line by collisions of hydrogen atoms with @xmath6 and using the b @xmath63 a transition for the h@xmath47h dimer .",
    "we have also fitted bvrijhk photometry of most of the coolest da / dc white dwarfs in the @xcite sample .",
    "two typical fits are shown in fig .",
    "our models have no difficulty in reproducing the observed b flux and excellent fits are obtained for most stars with either pure h or pure he .",
    "the importance of the @xmath1 line opacity in the models is revealed by comparing with fits of models that exclude this opacity source .",
    "the improvement in fitting the b flux with our ly@xmath0 opacity model is clearly visible .",
    "the star wd @xmath64 ( vb 11 , lower panel of fig .",
    "3 ) was assigned a pure helium composition by @xcite .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section .",
    "the success of the pure h models indicates that the @xmath1 red wing opacity is the missing blue opacity source in models of cool h - rich white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "color - color diagrams allow a broader comparison with data .",
    "figure 4 shows two large samples of cool wds , that of @xcite , and a combination of two samples culled from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric composition of the stars in the first sample , as determined by @xcite , is indicated in the left panel of fig .",
    "colors computed from our pure h model sequence , both with and without the @xmath1 opacity , are shown .",
    "our sequence of new pure hydrogen atmospheres follows the observed sequence of stars very well in these two color - color diagrams .",
    "equally good agreement is found in all other color - color diagrams involving bvrijhk and _ ugriz _ colors ( not shown here ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the sequence of pure helium models of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) used in the analysis of @xcite and @xcite also reproduces the observed sequence in the bvi color - color diagram .",
    "this potential ambiguity in the atmospheric composition of cool dc stars is resolved with a new sequence of pure he models .",
    "we have computed pure he models based on much improved constitutive physics for dense helium , including a better calculation of the ionization equilibrium and of the he@xmath65 ff and rayleigh scattering absorptions @xcite",
    ". a detailed description of these models will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "qualitatively , the correlations in dense fluid he reduces the contribution of raleigh scattering by a factor of @xmath66 @xcite and the strong interactions in the fluid increase the ionization fraction ( and hence , the he@xmath65 ff opacity ) by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude @xcite . the combination of these effects make he@xmath65 ff the only important source of opacity in these models . on the other hand , because of a lower ionization fraction and the higher rayleigh scattering opacity in a dilute gas , the pure he model spectra of @xcite are affected by both opacities ( see their fig .",
    "since he@xmath65 ff is a nearly gray opacity , our pure he atmosphere models are essentially gray and the emergent flux is close to that of a black body . the colors of this pure he sequence are shown in fig . 4 along with those of black bodies . compared to the @xcite pure he sequence , to our pure h sequence , and to the observed sequence of very cool wds , this new pure he sequence is much redder for @xmath67k . as the ionization fraction is sufficiently large for the he@xmath65 ff opacity to dominate , the colors of our new he sequence are insensitive to modest pollution by metals since increasing the fraction of free electrons will only increase the he@xmath65 ff opacity without any effect on the emergent spectrum . on the basis of the location of the pure h and pure he model sequences in the color - color diagrams ( fig .",
    "4 ) and the excellent fit we obtain for wd2054@xmath47050 with a pure hydrogen model , it appears that the atmospheric composition of the coolest dc stars needs to be revisited .",
    "the existence of an unidentified absorption mechanism in cool hydrogen white dwarfs atmospheres was reported a decade ago @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this missing opacity as the pseudo - continuum absorption from hydrogen atoms has been recently shown to be incorrect @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the red wing of the @xmath1 line opacity from hydrogen could provide the required absorption @xcite .",
    "we present a new calculation of the extreme pressure - broadening of the @xmath68 line by both @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "when included in our new pure hydrogen atmosphere models , we obtained an excellent agreement with the uv / optical / near - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the cool da white dwarf bpm 4729 and we successfully fitted the b through k spectral energy distributions of stars with hydrogen - rich atmospheres , as determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of broadening by collisions with h@xmath25 is essential to reproduce the sed of very cool hydrogen white dwarfs .    in color - color diagrams ,",
    "the new pure hydrogen models follow the observed sequences of cool white dwarfs very well , while an improved physical description of dense helium moves the cool end of the helium sequence to the red , near the locus of black body colors .",
    "this suggest that detailed fitting of the sed of the coolest dc white dwarfs will result in a number of them , and perhaps most , having hydrogen - rich composition rather than helium - rich .",
    "an example is provided by our fit to wd@xmath64 .",
    "this has direct implications for the spectral evolution of very cool white dwarfs and for the physical mechanisms responsible for their atmospheric composition .",
