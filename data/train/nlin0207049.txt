    "up to now we have only a limited understanding of the reasons for this universality , and quantum graph models provide a valuable opportunity for mathematically rigorous investigations of the phenomenon .",
    "in particular , for quantum graphs an exact trace formula exists @xcite which is based on the periodic orbits of a mixing classical dynamical system .",
    "moreover , it is possible to express two - point spectral correlation functions in terms of purely combinatorial problems @xcite .    by attaching infinite leads at the vertices , we get non - compact graphs , for which a scattering theory can be constructed @xcite .",
    "they display many of the feature that characterize scattering systems with an underlying chaotic classical dynamics @xcite , and they are the subject of the present paper .",
    "the _ quantum _ scattering matrix for such problems can be written explicitly , together with a trace formula for the density of its resonances .",
    "these expressions are the analogues of the corresponding semiclassical approximations available in the theory of chaotic scattering @xcite , albeit here they are exact . with these tools",
    "we analyze the distribution of resonances , partial delay times , and the statistics of the fluctuating scattering amplitudes and cross sections .",
    "moreover , we address issues like the statistical properties of the ensemble of the scattering matrices , and conductance distribution . finally we analyze the effect of non - uniform connectivity on the statistical properties of the scattering matrix .",
    "a main part of our analysis will be focused on the comparison of the statistical properties of the above quantities with the random matrix theory ( rmt ) predictions @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in section ( [ sec : definitions ] ) , the mathematical model is introduced and the main definitions are given .",

    "one of the basic concepts in the quantum theory of scattering are the resonances .",

    "to lowest order , @xmath120 , the resonances coincide with the spectrum of the compact graph .",

    "the system- specific properties of some graphs , will be pointed out .",
    "the study of these deviations is especially convenient for graphs because of the transparent and simple scattering theory developed in terms of scattering trajectories .",
    "an important parameter which is associated with the statistical properties of the @xmath0-matrix is the ericson parameter defined through the scaled mean resonance width as : @xmath187 where @xmath188 denotes spectral averaging and @xmath189 is the mean spacing between resonances .",
