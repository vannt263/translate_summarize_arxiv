    "low  energy cosmic rays ( crs ) are coupled to a number of important astrophysical processes .",
    "most of the integrated interstellar cr number density , energy density , pressure and ionization rate are contributed by the low  energy part of the spectrum because of its steepness ( see compilation in antoni et al .",
    "110 gev crs control the ionization fraction in the earth s lower atmosphere , and so cloud formation and lightning production ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "energy crs may regulate disk turbulence and affect planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the scale of the interstellar medium ,",
    "energy crs of @xmath2100 mev ( webber 1998 ) dominate the ionization fraction and heating of cool neutral gas , especially dark uv  shielded molecular regions @xcite . on larger scales ,",
    "cr `` pressure '' , most of which is contributed by low ",
    "energy crs , may help confine the galactic disk and drive the parker instability ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may itself contribute to the formation of large condensations that form stars , and even drive a galactic dynamo @xcite ; the cr pressure may also affect the hot coronal ism @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , any strong spatial variations of the cr number density could lead to important thermal , chemical , and dynamical effects .    in almost all previous work",
    "it is assumed that the cr density and spectrum do not vary significantly in space for length scales smaller than the scale of variation in space density of cr sources or ionization and spallation losses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the primary rationale is that a superposition of crs propagating diffusively to a point in the galaxy from many stochastic sources ( e.g. supernova remnants ) gives an rms variation in cr density of order 1% for typical values of parameters ( lee 1979 ; see berezinskii et al .",
    "1990 , sec .",
    "a more detailed calculation including the spatial distribution and discreteness of sources gives variations that are typically less than 1020% ( busching et al .",
    "this argument is not valid for low energy crs because it neglects the possibility that self  confinement of crs ( see below ) or ionization losses greatly reduce their propagation distance from the sources .",
    "the evidence for cr homogeneity inferred from egret @xmath3ray data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) applies only to a spatial resolution of approximately 5 degrees and to cr energies larger than of interest here .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath3ray emissivity is derived from an integral over long lines of sight , to which individual clouds or cores may be small contributions , especially at low galactic latitudes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show that large spatial variations of the cr number density should indeed exist in the ism , based on the standard cr transport equation (   2 ) , if low ",
    "energy crs are confined along flux tubes by scattering from self  generated alfvn waves (   3 ) .",
    "@xcite examined a model to exclude crs from molecular clouds based on screening the crs by ionization losses enhanced by cr self ",
    "confinement , but their model assumes that cr self  confinement sets in suddenly at the edges of molecular clouds because of an extremely large assumed cloud column density .",
    "the process examined here is completely independent of that model .",
    "multiple magnetic mirrors could also lead to cr variations of a factor of a few , depending on adopted parameters @xcite , a process that could be more important in the presence of tangled fields . in reality several effects may contribute to variations on roughly the same scale , but the effect found here has not been previously recognized , and is capable of giving cr variations up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "we show that , in a steady state , the cr density should locally scale with the square root of the ion density , up to densities above which damping of the waves allows the crs to stream freely (   3 ) , giving a sharp decline at densities around @xmath4  @xmath5 ( for 100  mev protons ) , typical of the transition from diffuse gas to dark molecular clouds .",
    "these variations may explain the apparent discrepancy between the large ionization rate derived by @xcite for the diffuse region along the line of sight to @xmath6 persei and the ionization rate estimated in dark molecular clouds (   4 ) .",
    "they should also result in large variations in cr pressure and heating rate in the ism and elsewhere .",
    "it is well  known that crs streaming along field lines at a speed larger than the alfvn speed generate mhd waves @xcite .",
    "the crs in turn interact with these self  generated waves through resonant pitch ",
    "angle scattering with waves whose wavenumbers are multiples of the particle gyroradius for a particle of a given energy ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite and others , the waves keep the crs confined to stream at a speed only slightly larger than the alfvn speed , if the waves are not efficiently damped .",
    "models of galactic cr propagation that rely on this effect in order to increase the escape time of crs from the galaxy are called self  confinement models , and are reviewed in @xcite and @xcite . self  confinement is generally believed to be efficient for crs of energies less than about 100  gev in mostly neutral interstellar material @xcite .    to demonstrate how self  confinement can lead to large cr density variations , we begin with the cr transport equation .",
    "the usual kinetic equation for the phase space distribution , @xmath7 , of crs interacting with a background plasma or self  generated mhd wave field can be derived from the vlasov equation , coupled with the cr particle equation of motion and maxwell s equations .",
    "a number of reasonable assumptions allows transformation of this equation into an equation for the distribution function of guiding centers , assuming the cr anisotropy is small .",
    "this equation was derived and discussed in various forms by @xcite , and many others . @xcite and",

    "when this background motion is due to mhd waves , the appropriate velocity depends on the distribution of the directions of wave propagation relative to the streaming of the crs .",
    "if the waves are self  generated , as we assume here , the directions of the waves and crs are the same , and @xmath11 can be replaced by the alfvn speed , @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the sources ( e.g. supernova remnants ) can be assumed far from the relatively small ( @xmath20.01 to 10  pc ) volume under consideration .",
    "similarly , we assume the mean magnetic field varies only over scales much larger than the scattering mean free path , so that we neglect mirroring and drifts due to mean field variations ( weak focusing limit ) .",

    "corresponding variations are expected also for the cr pressure , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 for relativistic crs , and @xmath67 for non  relativistic crs ) and for the cr ionization rate @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the cross section for the ionization of a hydrogen atom by a cr particle of momentum @xmath20 , and the factor @xmath70 accounts for heavy cr particles and for secondary electrons ( eg * ? ? ?",

    "for example , we expect a large dispersion in the relation between magnetic field strength and gas density and the cr flux normalization may vary with position relative to nearby cr sources .",

    "however , cr electrons , like cr protons , are confined to magnetic waves and should therefore follow the cr protons @xcite , and have the same density variations , although the critical densities for free  streaming may be different .",
    "this work points out the possibility of significant spatial variations in the cr pressure , ionization and heating rates .",
