    "the identity of dark matter ( dm ) , thought to make up approximately 25 percent of the energy - matter content of the universe  @xcite , has remained elusive since it was first suggested over 80 years ago .",
    "although there are an abundance of proposed particle physics models which can potentially account for dark matter , the most well studied class of model is that involving a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "wimps are appealing dark matter candidates because they can naturally account for the dark matter relic abundance via the `` wimp miracle '' @xcite , while also offering realistic prospects for detection in a variety of direct detection , collider , and indirect detection experiments .    however , the non - observation of wimps thus far has begun to place meaningful constraints on the wimp parameter space .",
    "experiments at the lhc , which is a proton - proton collider , have not identified a dm signal . direct detection ( dd )",
    "experiments , which require nucleon - dm interactions , similarly do not report a dm signal and are placing tough limits on dm - nucleon cross - sections @xcite , approaching the neutrino wall . however , the exclusions from these experiments are based on dm - hadron interactions , perhaps hinting that either the dm does not interact in such a way , or such interactions are suppressed . to relax constraints on the dm parameter space , we shall consider an alternate framework where direct dm - hadron interactions do not occur , and instead the dm couples exclusively to sm leptons at tree level .",
    "this is referred to as leptophilic dark matter ( ldm ) @xcite .",
    "a leptophilic dm model may be tested via the three usual dm searches : direct detection , indirect detection and collider searches . however , the phenomenology of leptophilic dm is quite different to that of a generic wimp .",
    "although leptophilic dm does not couple to quarks at tree - level , such couplings will inevitably exist at higher order .",
    "dm detection processes involving quarks will thus still yield limits , though they will be relaxed by the presence of loop factors and/or additional coupling constants , thereby increasing the allowed parameter space .",
    "for example , there exists a loop - suppressed direct detection process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop2 ] @xcite .",
    "we shall see that despite the suppressed nature of this process , direct detection still places meaningful constraints on leptophilic dark matter .",
    "loop2    ( 150,55 )    indirect detection experiments are a scan of the astrophysical sky , searching for unexplained fluxes which may be a produced as a result of dm annihilation or decay . for low dm masses , interesting indirect detection bounds have been placed using fermi observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite . at higher dm masses , significant interest in leptophilic",
    "dm was sparked by an excess in the cosmic ray positron fraction measured by the pamela @xcite , fermi @xcite and ams  @xcite experiments .",
    "given that no corresponding antiproton excess was seen , this suggested models in which dm annihilates , with a large cross section , to leptonic final states .",
    "however , these signals are subject to significant astrophysical uncertainties , and may in fact be produced by nearby pulsars @xcite . moreover ,",
    "as noted above , a model can only be `` leptophilic '' at lowest order with higher order process inevitably producing hadrons with non - negligible fluxes @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall not attempt to explain the positron results , but instead focus on lhc and direct detection bounds on leptophilic dark matter .",
    "collider searches at the lhc and lep @xcite have placed interesting limits on standard wimps .",
    "the most generic , model independent limits are those obtained from the mono - x searches @xcite ( mono - jet , mono - photon or mono - w / z ) .",
    "these signals are obtained when a single sm particle recoils against missing momentum , attributed to dark matter particles which escape undetected .",
    "however , the mono - x searches at the lhc require that dark matter to couples to quarks , and are thus not applicable for a leptophilic scenario",
    ". there exist mono - photon limits from lep @xcite , however these are only relevant for dm coupling to electrons ( rather than muons or taus ) and only extend to low dm masses .",
    "the lhc collider signals for leptophilic dm are very different from the mono - x signals and will be discussed in section [ sec : lhc ] below in the context of our example model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we introduce a simple leptophilic model in section  [ sec : model ] , consider relic density requirements in section  [ sec : relic ] , and discuss direct detection and other constraints in section  [ sec : direct ] and [ sec : constraints ] respectively .",

    "to fully investigate a ldm scenario , we shall adopt a particular simple model .",
    "we introduce a new spin-1 vector boson , @xmath0 , which mediates interactions between sm leptons and the dm .",
    "such a setup can be described via the lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the kinetic mixing parameter of @xmath0 and sm hypercharge gauge boson , @xmath3 are the sm leptons , @xmath4 are the @xmath0 coupling strengths to each sm lepton flavor , and @xmath5 is the coupling strength of the @xmath0 to dm .",
    "we allow both vector ( v ) and axial - vector ( a ) couplings of the @xmath0 .",

    "we take a different approach in the present work and consider a leptophilic @xmath0 which couples to a single lepton flavor , taking each flavour in turn .",
    "phenomenologically , this is a natural choice because the experimental constraints depend on which lepton flavor is being considered . with this approach",
    ", new dark sector particles must be chosen with the correct quantum numbers to cancel anomalies .",
    "however , any hidden sector particles other than the dm candidate can be taken to be heavy enough to be decoupled from our lagrangian , while light enough to still contribute to anomaly cancellation .",

    "it turns out this electron scattering is not very energetic , so that it can not usually be seen at dd experiments . in the rare case",
    "the electron has a high enough initial momentum to produce a sufficiently energetic dd signal , the cross section suffers from large wavefunction suppression . because of this , loop suppressed scattering with quarks will typically dominate dd for leptophilic dm @xcite provided the diagrams do not vanish . the dominant loop level process for direct detection in our @xmath0 model is shown in fig .",

    "however , a signal in this range would require a @xmath0 greater than 200 gev , for which the production cross section is extremely small . nonetheless , despite being unable to detect the dm production process",
    ", the presence of the @xmath0 coupling to dm still affects the collider phenomenology through the @xmath0 width and branching fractions , as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall22 ] and [ fig : mueall2 ] .",
    "finally , we note that this dilepton plus missing @xmath93 signal could be a relevant discovery channel in a future lepton collider such as the ilc , where the @xmath37+jets background is not present .",
    "our main results are summarized in fig .  [ fig : vv ] for @xmath52 and fig .  [",
    "fig : mueall22 ] , [ fig : mueall2 ] , [ fig : mueall ] for @xmath56 .",
    "note that because @xmath55 is highly constrained by the direct detection results , we have explored the @xmath11 case in much greater detail .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall22 ] , we summarise the results for a @xmath0 that couples to the muon flavour . we see that there is significant overlap of the excluded regions from @xmath149 and direct detection results , which each place non - trivial constraints on the model . in particular , for values of @xmath150 gev",
    ", they rule out those parameters for which the relic density can be explained , unless the masses fall in the vicinity of a resonance at @xmath151 .",
    "the lhc results place complementary constraints . for a low mass @xmath0 ( those with @xmath152 )",
    ", the collider limits rule out smaller values of the coupling @xmath153 than can be probed by dd or @xmath154 . the projected limits ( or discovery sensitivity ) for the 14 tev lhc at 3000  @xmath104 significantly covers the low @xmath26 parameter space , even for parameters for which the dm relic density is controlled by resonant annihilation . for a higher mass @xmath0 ( @xmath91 )",
    "the production cross section at the lhc is suppressed , and hence only the 3000  @xmath104 results are shown in the figure .",
    "it is clear that , for sufficiently large @xmath155 or @xmath26 , it will be possible to find parameters which satisfy the relic density requirement and escape all constraints .",
    "the constraints on a @xmath0 which couples to the @xmath64 flavour are shown in lh panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mueall ] .",
    "the dd constraints are similar for all flavours , as they depend only logarithmically on the lepton masses . for electrons ,",
    "the @xmath154 constraint is too weak to be shown on the plot .",
    "however , the @xmath64-flavour is subject to lep - ii @xmath0 constraints , which are very strong and eliminate much parameter space that is open for the @xmath45-flavour . as a result , the relic density constraints can not be met unless one lives very close to a resonance .    finally , we consider the @xmath69 flavour in the rh panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall ] . here",
    "the @xmath154 constraints are again too weak to be shown on the plot . as we mentioned above , there are no current collider analyses for this case , due to the difficulties associated with tau reconstruction . instead , we indicate in fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall ] the @xmath0 production cross section , as a crude indication of the sensitivity that could be obtained were a dedicated analysis for the 4-@xmath69 final state to be performed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall22 ] and [ fig : mueall ] , we assumed the @xmath0 couples with equal strength to the dm and leptons , i.e. @xmath156 . if instead we take @xmath157 , the constraints are relaxed and thus the allowed region of parameter space enlarged .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall2 ] , in which we take @xmath158 ( left panel ) and @xmath159 ( right panel ) .",
    "we see that increased @xmath5 lowers the relic density curves .",
    "the lhc curves are independent of the choice of @xmath5 when @xmath160 ; for @xmath161 the constraints on @xmath153 become weaker as we enlarge @xmath5 , due to the increased branching ratio of the @xmath0 to invisible final states . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mueall22 ] and [ fig : mueall2 ] , this occurs for @xmath162 gev , and we note an upturn in the lhc curves at that point .",
    "the lhc results for high @xmath0 masses @xmath163 have not been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall2 ] , as they are weaker than the dd results .    the lhc curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mueall22 ] , [ fig : mueall2 ] and [ fig : mueall ] assume @xmath164 gev . for other dm masses , the exclusion curves are approximately the same , except for a change to the point where @xmath165 , beyond which the @xmath0 is heavy enough for the dark branching ratio to be non - zero.(dm ) is non - zero , if @xmath166 the cross section and thus the exclusion curves change only by a modest factor . ]",
    "we have considered a leptophilic wimp scenario in which dm does not couple to sm quarks at tree - level , and instead couples only to sm leptons . in this scenario ,",
    "the dm has wimp - scale interaction with leptons , accounting for the relic density , but suppressed signals in direct detection experiments and hadron colliders , consistent with the null results from these searches to date .",
    "we explored such a leptophilic dm in the context of a simple @xmath0 model , in which dm - lepton interactions are mediated by the exchange of a new vector boson which couples to one of the sm leptons flavours , @xmath167 , @xmath45 , or @xmath69 , with lorentz structure @xmath52 or @xmath11 .",
    "dm - quark interactions are induced at loop level through kinetic mixing of the @xmath0 and sm hypercharge , providing nuclear recoil signals in direct detection experiments . despite the loop - suppressed nature of this process ,",
    "the resulting bounds are strong . for @xmath52",
    "the dd bounds eliminate all parameter space for which the correct relic density can be obtained , except if the dm annihilation cross section has a strong resonant enhancement . for @xmath56",
    "the direct detection cross section is velocity suppressed , resulting in weaker constraints , but even so the dd bounds eliminate significant parameter space . for dm coupling to muons , these bounds are comparable to those from @xmath149 .",
    "production of leptophilic @xmath0 at the lhc occurs via the radiation of a @xmath0 from drell - yan leptons .",
    "we determined exclusion limits for the @xmath0 mass and coupling strength , using results from a recent atlas analysis of @xmath168 or @xmath113 , at @xmath103 tev and @xmath169 @xmath104 .",
    "we also projected the future exclusion / discovery reach for @xmath63 tev and higher luminosities , for both low and high mass @xmath0 bosons .",
    "for @xmath170 , the combination of the lhc , direct detection , and relic density constraints excludes most parameter space , except that for which the dm annihilation at freezeout is resonantly enhanced . for @xmath171 , some non - resonant parameter space remains open for @xmath172 gev , while for @xmath167 this is eliminated by lep - ii bounds .",
    "for @xmath173 , however , no lhc bounds exist , and much more parameter space is open .    in conclusion , despite the absence of tree - level interactions with quarks , this leptophilic dark matter model is strongly constrained by results from nuclear recoil and hadron collider experiments .    _ note added : _ a recent paper has calculated limits on a @xmath0 boson which couples to muon lepton number , based on neutrino trident production  @xcite . these limits are a factor of @xmath174 stronger than those from @xmath149 .",
