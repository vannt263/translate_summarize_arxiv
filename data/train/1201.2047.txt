    "* victor : * i suppose this is an interesting setting to be doing this , as one story would suggest you originally come not from very far from here@xmath0    * david : * indeed ! now i do nt know the specifics , but there were brillingers in basel at the end of 1400s . once we were in zurich , at peter buhlmann s invitation , and we saw a statue that was close : b - u - l - l - i - n - g - e - r .",
    "now , the brillingers in basel became protestant at the time of martin luther .",
    "the next time i find them is in the 1700s when brillingers went to pennsylvania as mennonites .",
    "they finally got up to canada after the american revolution .",
    "they were the original draft dodgers .",
    "you see then , in america , men had to be in the militia , but the  brillingers were pacifists .",
    "so they went to ontario where they could practice their religion as they wished .",
    "so i d like to think that there is some swiss background and presumably it would have been through some great  great uncle who was `` rektor '' of the university of basel .",
    "* victor : * i see , i  see , so it would then be brillinger ( german pronunciation ) rather than brillinger(french pronunciation ) ?",
    "* david * : that s right .",
    "and you victor told me that you ve seen a truck on the swiss highway with brillinger on it . also alessandro ( villa ) told me he saw a  mailbox with brillinger on it , or something like  that .",
    "* victor : * jumping much further into the future : you grew up in canada .",
    "* david : * yes !    * victor : * could you tell us a bit about your family ?",
    "* david : * my father died  let s just work it out ",
    "when i was 7 months old , so this was very harsh on my mother .",
    "she woke up in the middle of the night and he seemed to be in some trouble , but then she fell back asleep and i think she felt guilty about that ever after .",
    "i  doubt there was anything that could have been done back then because he died of a cerebral hemorrhage .",
    "i  wish i could have gotten to know them together better .",
    "you know , they had their house , a cottage , a dog and so on .",
    "they had a harley motorcycle and went off on that on their honeymoon , they had a sailing canoe@xmath0 lakes and canadian things were very much part of their lives .",
    "my mother was actually a very beautiful woman , when you see the pictures , with smiles ( figure  [ brill_young ] ) .",
    "but the smiles mostly disappeared after my father s death .",
    "then , it was world war ii times and most of the men were gone .",
    "it s hard for me to imagine she would nt have remarried .",
    "but it just never happened .",
    "she really cared a great deal about my education and structured things so that i got a fine education . at the start",
    ", there was a bit of money  because my father was going to be an actuary , so she had some insurance money .",
    "i  went to a private boys school in toronto until the money ran out .",
    "then , there was this school for bright kids in toronto , the university of toronto schools ( uts ) .",
    "i  took the exam and got into it .",
    "uts was very important for me .",
    "i  should mention that my maternal grandmother was also very important , and perhaps she raised me .",
    "she had had her husband die in the great flu epidemic and found herself with five children to raise .",
    "so i had , i  think , a beginning that made me appreciate being alive and not really expecting too much to come from it .",
    "i  really have been pretty content and nonaggressive about things in my life and feel very lucky .",
    "you know , all four of my uncles  and i ve decided they were my role models  were taxi cab drivers at some point in their lives . the way they could just talk to anybody and the way they engaged people to some extent formulated the way i have become .",
    "i  had a lot of paying jobs as i was growing up , including caddying , delivering prescriptions , salesperson in a small shop .",
    "i had a lot of cousins that were important to me because i did nt have siblings .",
    "and there were a  lot of wonderful mother s side family gatherings .",
    "so , i  do nt think i really thought about not having a  father when young , but i do wish i could have asked my father certain questions since we did not have much contact with the brillinger side of the family .",
    "that was a shame .",
    "* victor : * did you have any influential teachers at school ?",
    "* david : * oh , yes !",
    "there is one very influential teacher who taught me when i was at upper canada college  that was the private boy s school .",
    "i  had not started the year there and when i transferred , he found out that i was not very good at fractions .",
    "so , he spent some time tutoring me .",
    "now he was also an important person in ontario hockey . and after tutoring me he came in the class one day and said he had 5 hockey rulebooks and he was going to give one of them to whoever answered a mathematical problem first .",
    "so first question , my hand went up , one rulebook ; second question , second rulebook ; third question , third rulebook !",
    "so he said , `` david that s it , you ca nt get anymore of those ! ''",
    "i really learned i was good at sports . or no , actually , i  was nt good at sports , i  was good at math , but i was very motivated when it came to sports ( laughs ) !",
    "the teacher s name was h. earl elliott .",
    "* victor : * and those were the same rulebook ?        * david : * ( laughs ) oh yes !",
    "i do nt know what i was going to do with all of them !",
    "he had not specified any rules , so i had three and gave my cousins two !",
    "i had realized i was good at math , and i loved working on math problems .",
    "a lot of books had problems without the solutions in the back .",
    "i  had a lot of fun doing them .",
    "perhaps i had more time to do that because the weather was bad in the winter and i did not have siblings .",
    "afterward , i  went to uts .",
    "i  said that was for bright kids , but part of the definition of `` bright kids '' then was being male ( both laugh)@xmath0 luckily things changed , although uts no longer wins the toronto high school hockey championship like it used to !",
    "i had a very influential mathematics teacher there , bruce mclean ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "he was also the hockey coach and is still alive .",
    "he would just let me work at the back of the room on my own .",
    "everybody else was up toward the front , but he would just leave me alone at this table and bring these books full of problems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "statistics was one of the topics .",
    "and there were these british problems that you ve probably seen in the tripos , victor , things like that .",
    "i  do nt know about what level i  would have been at had i been in england , because students there started working with these concepts very early on .",
    "i  read a book where i think dyson said he had solved all the problems in piaggio s differential equation book ( piaggio , @xcite ) , but when he was at public school  i did that when i got to university , so i guess i was lagging behind .",
    "but i think i was very independently driven to work on these things .",
    "i  thought i solved them , but , you know , i  did nt quite know ; but anyway , i  solved them to my satisfaction .",
    "then , ontario used to have some pretty tough high school exams , for the last year ",
    "grade 13and four of them were on algebra , geometry , trigonometry and problems respectively .",
    "i  got 100 , 99 and 100 on the first three and 96 on the last .",
    "i  still think about that 96 .",
    "you see you were to do 10 problems , but there were 12 .",
    "so i `` solved ''",
    "later `` mr . ''",
    "mclean told me that the person who was grading kept getting a total of 116 on my exam , and he could not figure out what was going on for a  while . eventually , he realized that i had attempted all 12 .",
    "my error was that one of them was finding the maximum or minimum of something , so to show off i used calculus , but i forgot about checking the second derivative ! i ve never forgotten that since ( both laugh ) !",
    "but anyway , that brought me a scholarship that helped me make my way at university .",
    "back then , prizes were important because there were nt many bursaries .",
    "now , in america , they ve switched to means tests .",
    "but i won a lot of prizes as an undergraduate which kept my mother and me with food and so on .",
    "* victor : * evidently , mathematics was one thing you enjoyed , but what about sports ?",
    "* david : * i love sports , i  always have and i have always been a toronto maple leafs fan .",
    "i  do nt know if i still have it , but there was a wonderful picture of me about 3 years old with hockey stick in hand and skates on feet .",
    "i  was often the last guy to make the team or the first guy not to make the team  but i was always there !",
    "when i was growing up , they would flood the whole neighborhood park so there would be 5 or more hockey games going on .",
    "you did nt need all this fancy equipment .",
    "i  guess i could make the formal teams until i was 13 or so , but then that stopped .",
    "it returned for a while when i went to princeton as a graduate student .",
    "there i got to be like an intramural star , because i could raise the puck , knew the rules and played left - handed .",
    "now , i  mentioned my high school teacher , bruce mclean .",
    "there s a story i love concerning him : there was my 50th high school reunion a couple of years back and i was in edmonton the week before the reunion and was going to need to be in toronto the week after , so it was just too much time to be away from berkeley .",
    "one of my dear friends from high school and university , john gardner ( now chair of the board of directors of the fields mathematical institute ) , asked if i d like him to arrange a lunch with `` nails '' mclean  his nickname for uts students was `` nails . ''",
    "i said of course !",
    "so , when i went to toronto the week after , we had lunch .",
    "mclean was 96 , and had driven in through all the traffic to central toronto for the lunch .",
    "we had a wonderful time .",
    "it turned out he had also been in the navy , so we discussed that .",
    "but at the end of the meal he got this incredibly serious look on his face .",
    "so i m thinking , `` what s this all about ? ''",
    "and he says `` david , when you were at school , there was something i really worried about , i  worried about it for a long time . ''",
    "so i m sitting there with my eyes rolled back and wondering .",
    "he continued , `` i really wanted you on the hockey team , but there were a lot of good players that year ! ''",
    "( both laugh ) .",
    "i  just grin when i remember that .",
    "and indeed the team was good .",
    "they won the toronto championship .",
    "i  just wanted to get the sweater , go to practice , and , if we re winning 72 , get to skate around a bit .",
    "but i had to wait until princeton to do that .",
    "* victor : * you mentioned before that you were in the navy , can you tell us a bit more about that ?",
    "* david : * that was at university .",
    "i  knew that by joining the navy i was going to get to go outside of toronto and perhaps canada for a bit ; because toronto was really a bit boring back then .",
    "canada did not have a draft  still doesnt  so the way the government thought they could get officers for the regular military was by having army , navy and air force programs at the universities .",
    "that was a bit like boy scouts , and i d been a cub ( figure  [ brill_young ] ) and a boy scout . for me , it was obvious to join the navy because i loved to canoe and sail , and you got to go to europe and mexico . whereas if you were in the army , you got to march around in the dust of ontario ; and if you were in the air force , you were in saskatchewan , which is flat , and with not so much to do then .",
    "so , i  was on my way to seeing the world and at the same time got paid very well ; the food and the clothing were obviously provided .",
    "plus , it was a lot of fun , i  just loved it .",
    "i  mean guns were only 5% or less of the life .",
    "so it was a no - brainer to be in the navy .",
    "second year i was based on the west coast ( figure  [ brill_navy ] ) . in the program",
    "there was a prize for the person who was best in navigation and i think i won probably easily , as i had taken an astronomy course and had learned all this spherical trigonometry previously .",
    "the way things worked , i  ended up being a communications officer learning about radio and coding .",
    "this was great since i had been learning physics as well as mathematics .",
    "you know , in my career i ve gotten to study mostly the things i was good at and enjoyed .",
    "i  was principally good at math , and it was obvious what my career was to be .    * victor : * you once told me a story about doing some very applied statistics in the navy .",
    "* david : * that was my first independent statistical research activity , i  would say !",
    "so let s think .",
    "my fourth summer , i  had already gone through a lot of basic training , becoming a communications specialist and a sub lieutenant .",
    "i  was going to be in the aircraft carrier , the bonnaventure , and we were supposed to sail into the middle of the atlantic because the queen was going to fly over there on her way to visit canada .",
    "and so we were to be stationed out there .",
    "i  do nt know why , maybe in case she leapt out with a parachute or something like that !",
    "i mean it was awfully ill - defined ( both laugh ) !    * victor : * @xmath1after all it is the _ royal _ canadian navy !    *",
    "david : * exactly !",
    "so we had to toast to the queen  at banquets and such and such .",
    "anyway , they had to find something for me to do during the open period before the mission .",
    "so , they decided that , since i  was studying statistics , they would like to know how  many messages were sent out by the fleet weekly for  several years .",
    "they took me to this room , and here  were these huge stacks of signals by week .",
    "i  would still be counting them if i had done it directly !",
    "but instead i thought why do nt i just get 100 and weigh them and estimate a weight per signal .",
    "and then  i  asked for a scale , which they found .",
    "and i just measured how heavy the piles were , and so i gave them  nice graphs .",
    "when the fleet was at sea , there were  a  lot more signals , and things like that .",
    "i  guess it sounds nutty to be saying the following , i  mean i m totally a pacifist and i think i ve been that all my life ",
    "but i did enjoy the navy !",
    "i suppose back then canada was doing peace keeping . like brazil s these days , that was the canadian role then .",
    "our prime minister lester pearson won the nobel peace prize for the idea of creating a un peace force .",
    "my thought was that the world needs policemen , and since canada  was not in an aggressive posture at that point , i  signed up . by the way , in the remaining time before the  cruise , i  did a lot of dinghy sailing in halifax harbor .",
    "* victor : * shall we talk a bit about the university of toronto ( u of t ) ?",
    "you did your bachelors honours in pure mathematics .",
    "i  recall you telling me in berkeley that you were already reading bourbaki as a first year undergraduate  in french .",
    "* david : * yes , that s true !",
    "i was lucky because canada was trying to be bilingual to support its francophones and i studied french for seven years .",
    "so there was a professor at u of t , john coleman  who is still alive , aged a hundred or so i think ; these canadian mathematicians live a long time .",
    "he found out i could learn and read in french .",
    "i  think he identified me especially because i had won this prize for algebra / geometry / trigonometry and problems .",
    "he found what i looked like by watching where my homework handed back ended up in the classroom .",
    "he invited me for a coffee or whatever .",
    "actually , he was remembering when i talked to him a couple of years ago that we had butter tarts and tea when we met .",
    "he got me reading bourbaki .",
    "and then he said why do nt you do some of these problems ?",
    "so we met then each week : i  could nt do the problems , and perhaps he had trouble too .",
    "i  do nt know if i could do them now , it would be fun to try .",
    "the first book was on algebra and i believe that coleman bought it for me .",
    "i  still have it ( bourbaki , @xcite ) . the later ones on analysis have probably been the most important to me .",
    "coleman got me reading bourbaki and i remain very appreciative . going through them really stood me in good stead when i got to princeton .",
    "i  found myself a couple of years ahead of the american students .",
    "you see i d gotten to do mainly maths and physics at toronto , and i also had this secret weapon : french !",
    "i mean the french probabilists were then doing all this wonderful stuff , e.  borel , p.  lvy and m. frchet , for example .",
    "and most of their things were not being translated . nowadays",
    "the french mathematicians write in english most of the time so that s not an issue .",
    "that was first year .",
    "that year i also had a course from ralph wormleighton , he had been at princeton ",
    "there was a real toronto  princeton railroad including don fraser , art dempster , ralph wormleighton ; and when i applied to grad school i only applied to princeton .",
    "it never occurred to me to apply anywhere else .",
    "i  do nt think that was a statement of confidence , but i did nt have anyone who had been at university at home , so i just was not getting that kind of advice .",
    "the second year was dempster .",
    "dempster has often taken the geometric approach .",
    "when i took a course from coxeter , i  later saw where that approach was coming from .",
    "and then in the third year was don fraser  he was certainly using a lot of algebra .",
    "the fourth year was dan delury .",
    "he was this skeptical older guy .",
    "he d been out doing biometrical studies .",
    "his attitude was that one might have thought that they had designed an experiment well , but there were many ways that an experiment might have gone wrong .",
    "his course was very maturing for me .",
    "it s important to have some training in criticism when you re an applied statistician .",
    "* victor : *",
    "so , that means that you would have had quite a rigorous maths background but also would have been exposed to quite a bit of statistics , which is rather atypical for that time period .    *",
    "david : * although i was in pure mathematics  that s  what my degree was in ",
    "i went to all the statistics courses .",
    "as a matter of fact , i  probably went to _ all _ the courses , including the actuarial ones .",
    "back then , i  could just sit there and absorb things .",
    "it s not as though i m boasting ; i used to feel embarrassed about saying things like that , but i think i was just lucky : it was not really anything i did , it s just the way it was .",
    "i  wish i could have played hockey better , but i did nt get that skill nor the ability to run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds .",
    "i  guess i m saying there may be a gene that i was lucky enough to get .",
    "* victor : * do you recall any lectures that you particularly enjoyed ?",
    "coxeter had a fine reputation as a lecturer i suppose .",
    "* david : * oh yes , coxeter was wonderful .",
    "he had left england after world war ii .",
    "also tutte , who is another geometer , was great .",
    "in fact , tutte had broken one of the important nazi codes in world war  ii  and none of us knew that .",
    "but some people in the class were mean to him because he was a  little shy , and they teased him .",
    "i m sure if they had known about his breaking the code , they would have been more like `` wow '' instead .",
    "regarding coxeter , i  remember one funny story , where he was talking about a particular geometry for many classes .",
    "his course became his book ( coxeter , @xcite ) or the book was part of his course .",
    "so , there was this particular finite geometry he was talking about a lot , with very bare assumptions and he was talking about it during a number of classes .",
    "so , finally , i  asked,``why are you spending so much time on this , is it _ that _ important ? '' and he said something like : `` well you seemed so interested , mr .",
    "brillinger ! ''",
    "i mean , i  was just asking questions to keep up with where he was going !",
    "i was intending to become an actuary for many years , in part because my father worked for imperial life .",
    "and they were very good to my mother and me .",
    "i  had realized that if you are poor but good at mathematics , then an actuarial career was a route to the middle class .",
    "i m not sure i was after being middle class , but i needed to help my mother , so i was going to be an actuary . but don fraser , who had great influence on me ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) , said something like : `` well , david , sure that s nice , that you re going to be an actuary , but why do nt you go to princeton first ? ''",
    "so , i  did !",
    "i went to princeton , the plan being to become an actuary after i was done with all this childish fun , namely , mathematics.=1        * victor : * apparently it was _ too _ much fun@xmath1 !",
    "* david : * i guess that s right .",
    "and i realized at some point that anything i could do as an actuary , i  could probably do as a statistician  with the added benefit that i would get to travel and be an academic .",
    "i  did take enough of the exams to become an associate of the society of actuaries .    * victor : * just before going off to princeton , you were among the winning five of the putnam competition of spring58 .",
    "* david : * it was again coleman who got me involved .",
    "* victor : * and i recognized a couple of other famous names on the same honours list , richard dudley and larry shepp .",
    "* david : * yes , i  got to know them both .",
    "you see , both of them went to princeton for graduate studies .",
    "i  really had no idea of what was involved .",
    "i  just went and took the exam !",
    "i remember that erds visited toronto for a month and he gave a course .",
    "one of the problems he taught us was on the putnam exam !",
    "( laughs ) some number theory thing ( continues laughing)@xmath0 so on the exam day that one was out of the way pretty quickly !",
    "he was just a real gem , a real role model .",
    "i  mean he had these simple direct ways to approach problems , and would advocate that you should take a breath before you start writing down a lot of equations and things like that .",
    "u of t was absolutely super .",
    "i  got a super education in mathematics there and at high school .",
    "i  mean some people might think of canada as being a backwater , or as having been one , but there were some very fine researchers and teachers . you know ,",
    "coleman had also gone to princeton just before the war started .",
    "i  was lucky .",
    "i ca nt resist adding that , while i was at u of t , i  was actually at victoria university .",
    "there , i  earned a letter for playing on the soccer and squash teams , each for four years .",
    "i  can show the letter to you !",
    "i would also like to add that art dempster and don fraser have long been role models for their ex - students . in research",
    "they each have taken roads less travelled in their work .",
    "* victor : * when did you move to new jersey ?",
    "* david : * in the summer of 59 .",
    "that was my last summer in the navy , and i had become a lieutenant .",
    "i  turned up there in the beginning of august having left the bonnaventure .",
    "i  had asked if there was some work for me , and it turned out that sam wilks had just finished writing his book mathematical statistics ( wilks , @xcite ) .",
    "my job was to work on the problems .",
    "i  remember i just lay out under the trees at graduate school working on them , right by the golf course  which i  would golf on most days , illegally .",
    "i  remember going over to wilks office just before term started .",
    "one of my canadian friends , irwin guttman , was there .",
    "i  said , `` well here are the solutions , but i could nt get one of them . '' and wilks went `` what ? ? ? '' in the end he took that problem out of the book .",
    "it was about proving that the median and the mean were jointly asymptotically normal .",
    "it took me a while to figure out a neat way to do that .",
    "* victor : * you got right into mathematical statistics upon arriving at princeton .",
    "* david : * oh yes .",
    "already at toronto , i  could see that statistics , perhaps as an actuary , was for me , because you interact with people a lot .",
    "math was a  lot of fun too , but you interact with a much narrower group of people .",
    "delury had impressed me , because he was really working at the frontier of the applications of statistics .",
    "i  have found myself realizing that statisticians are the keepers of the scientific method . when a scientist comes up with something",
    ", what can they reasonably conclude ?",
    "that appealed to me , to be able to get involved in many fields .",
    "* victor : * and when did you meet tukey ?    * david : * ( laughs ) aaaaah , john tukey@xmath0 i watched him like a hawk ! because he was so interesting generally and so much fun to watch .",
    "i  had been told about tukey by coleman .",
    "coleman had been a graduate student when tukey was at princeton .",
    "and coleman told me that i was going to meet someone who , at beer parties , was always drinking milk , he just had a big glass of milk .",
    "so i knew before meeting him that tukey was different . because at a beer party in canada you drink beer , that s part of your manhood , or something like that .",
    "princeton ; at princeton you did nt have to take any courses .",
    "you could sign up for one and would get an a , even if you never turned up .",
    "you had to write a thesis and pass an oral exam , so that was pretty good !",
    "so let s see ; tukey gave a time series course . and here was this person , unlike any other person i had ever met .",
    "he was from new england , very canadian in a lot of ways .",
    "he had pride in his background .",
    "he was careful with money , and he had apple pie for breakfast .",
    "so i  went to his time series course and this involved a lot of fourier analysis ",
    "and i had a strong background in trigonometry and that made the course attractive .",
    "* victor : * did you attend any of these courses along with david freedman ?    * david : * oh yes ! david f. was a year ahead of me , and he was influential on me ( pauses and reflects for a moment ) .",
    "i  guess , oh my , most of these people are dead now , goodness .",
    "ok , whatever .",
    "i  have these two stories about david , one involving frank anscombe and the other john tukey .",
    "now , david was a year ahead of me at princeton .",
    "he was from montreal , i  was from toronto so we were natural `` rivals , '' right from the beginning ! that s just the way it was .",
    "of course i do nt mean that in a bad way .",
    "anyway , frank had asked david f. to be his teaching assistant in a course . and",
    "david said , `` but i am on a scholarship , i  do nt have to do that ! '' `` ok , fine , '' said frank , and then frank asked me ( laughs ) .",
    "and i knew what david had said , and got to give the same answer !",
    "david analyzed a lot of situations very clearly , and i observed david as i do a lot of people .",
    "david f. never changed in terms of his intellectual calibre and wit , and the character of his questions .",
    "david was also in tukey s time series course .",
    "early in the term tukey used the word spectrum several times . and",
    "david after , i  do nt know , 20 minutes or some such , asked what the definition of a spectrum was .",
    "so , tukey said something like : `` well , suppose you ve got a radar transmitting signals up and it bounces off an airplane and a signal returns @xmath1 so you see @xmath1 well that s a spectrum . ''",
    "so , david s manner was `` well , ok . ''",
    "then the next class the same thing happened .",
    "tukey mentioned the spectrum , david wanted a definition , and tukey said , `` well , suppose you have a sonar system and it bounces a signal off a submarine , or some such''@xmath1 david never came back ( both laugh ) !    that was really pure david f. , wanting clear explicit definitions .",
    "tukey and david were the opposites of each other .",
    "you see , tukey believed in vague concepts .",
    "he believed that if you tried to define something too precisely , then you would have lost important aspects going along with it .",
    "but david did nt think that you could talk about things properly unless you were completely clear .",
    "of course , tukey s and david s great confrontation was over census adjustment .",
    "i  picture that david took a strict interpretation over what was required , while jwt was after an effective estimate of the counts .",
    "it is no surprise that david was debating champion at mcgill .",
    "he surely could have been a fine lawyer , and then a judge , and then@xmath0        * victor : * he did get involved with statistics and the law .    * david : * yes , he was involved in statistics and economics , too .",
    "he worked at the bank of canada for a  while .",
    "i  think he might have expected that he would be going down that road .",
    "he probably thought that being  a statistician you can do anything you want to  that was my own reason for choosing statistics .",
    "david was a very sweet person .",
    "i  am thinking just now of his taking lorie and me out to dinner in a  nice princeton restaurant after we got back from our honeymoon .",
    "* victor : * going back to tukey , what did you learn from him as a researcher , what was his style ?",
    "* david : * i learned that there are novel ways to solve most problems .",
    "i  think jwt could add two four - digit numbers in ten different ways that no one else in human history would ever have thought of !",
    "i mean he was like richard feynman .",
    "he was of the same ilk .",
    "there are people , and there are lots of historical examples , who just think differently than almost everyone else .",
    "also what i have learned from tukey is that there is a physical interpretation of so many of these concepts when you look at the history of mathematics . that s what i tried to bring up in my talk this morning about how some of these things came out of kepler and lagrange and so on",
    "( david was lecturing on sde modeling of random trajectories using potential functions ) . that you can understand a lot of this contemporary work if you think about how it had been generated in the first place .",
    "i  think tukey often found himself explaining things to people who did nt know much mathematics .",
    "i  paid attention to how he did that .",
    "i  would like to think that i m not bad at doing that too . in a  sense",
    ", you probably lie a bit , i  mean you probably use an analogy or a metaphor at some point , which is not quite right , but people get the idea .",
    "* victor : * that s the advantage of vagueness .",
    "* david : * yes , indeed ! tukey s",
    "vagueness meant , for example , that we could start out with standard errors and later find ourselves talking about the interquartile range , just letting the idea of `` spread '' be vague .",
    "* victor : * what was your relationship like when he became your advisor ?",
    "* david : * there were lots of good problems around fine hall and the labs that i worked on .",
    "eventually , jwt suggested a particular one .",
    "the deal seemed to be that if i started to have trouble , i  should go see him .",
    "maybe his not being around town often was part of the breaks in our meetings .",
    "when i would meet him , if i seemed a bit too cocky , he would knock me down ; and if i looked discouraged , he would build me up .",
    "my thesis concerned formalizing gauss s delta method by working with truncated random variables asymptotically .",
    "another thing was that during the school year i  had the day - a - week job at bell labs , so often i drove back and forth to bell labs with him , sometimes in his convertible . during those drives",
    ", we talked about a lot of things .",
    "sometimes , there were other passengers too .",
    "i  learned while working with him that , when he used some new word , i  should nt worry about it .",
    "i  should just let him talk a while and then try to figure out what it was all about .",
    "i  think a lot of people had a hard time understanding what he was trying to get at .",
    "i  would eventually come up with something ; now if it s really what he meant , i  do nt know .",
    "i d say i had a wonderful relationship with him ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "i  would kid him ",
    "i  mean i did nt know you should nt tease professors until much later ! because i was working class canadian and had my uncles as role models . that s how they d approach people",
    ". not mean teasing , just seeking a smile .",
    "i  have also teased david cox .",
    "david was patient with me .",
    "* there was good chemistry between you , then . because , you know , he was relatively conservative and you ve been pretty progressive and open about it all along .    * david : * there was , yes sure .",
    "we could talk about things just like that .",
    "no tension .",
    "he was on the conservative side , true .",
    "but it was more about different cultures .",
    "he was american and i am canadian .",
    "canadians are progressively conservative . in those days , there was a conservative spirit in canadians when it comes to the way one dresses or the way you talk to other people .",
    "so , there was conservatism in me , but it was social conservatism , not political conservatism .    *",
    "victor : * well , it would appear that tukey had a  very high opinion of you . it has been rumored that he used a `` milli - brillingers '' scale to measure people up ?    * david : * ( laughs ) yes , i  have heard that from several people , including mike godfrey and bill williams , but what does one say ?",
    "bill told me that once tukey asked about a prospective student , `` how many milli- brillingers ? ''",
    "bill s reply was `` four or five hundred mb s . ''",
    "john responded with something like , `` well that s very good . ''",

    "* david : * sam was wonderful too .",

    "it s a shame that he died way too soon .",
    "one story is that he was taking shingles medicine and drank some alcohol that night and there was a bad synergy .",
    "another is that there was an unpleasant meeting over the admission of a student to the program .",
    "sam was conservative politically , but that was never an issue .",
    "he had me work on these problems in the draft of his book as i mentioned .",
    "i  also sat in on the course that was based on the book he was writing .",
    "he was a social animal .",
    "i  can tell you one story .",
    "the tukeys ",
    "god knows for what reason  had decided to have a come - as - your - spouse party .",
    "so lorie was supposed to dress like me and i like lorie , and so on and so forth , mrs .",
    "tukey like john tukey , and john tukey like mrs .",
    "tukey . that happened , but gena and sam wilks came along as themselves ! near the end of my studying , i  went off for an interview at the university of michigan , before i  knew whether i would receive a postdoc .",
    "jimmy savage was there then .",
    "i  told him about the party .",
    "and i think he went like this ( david holding his chin down ) and said , `` i know too much freud to ever do something like that ! ''",
    "i did nt know a lot about freud and i still do nt know what savage meant , but he did know a  great deal about a great deal of things .",
    "* victor : * so how did you meet lorie ?",
    "* david : * blind date ! and we re both proud of that ! one has to take risks sometimes .",

    "she was studying sociology and had taken a statistics course using mood and graybill  not an easy book .",
    "she was in princeton in the `` work '' component at the commercial side of the gallup poll .",

    "carl was in mathematics , eventually becoming a professor at mcmaster university , and elaine was also working at gallup .",
    "i  think her and lorie s desks were next to each other .",

    "i went back to toronto a lot  no course responsibilities , remember ?",
    "lorie was attractive and we found lots of things to talk about .",
    "anyway , it was a blind date . and , i  do nt know , we just hit it off quickly !",
    "one thing that i loved about lorie was that she was very political ",
    "my politics were nt well formed at all yet  and she was also very analytical .",
    "her parents even more so !",
    "later , we realized that we each had a parent who had been born in china , the child of methodist missionaries .",
    "* victor : * what a coincidence !",
    "* david : * oh yes ! they were , in fact , in the same part of china : sichuan province . and",
    "now with the web , you can find surprising things .",
    "so , i  entered my brillinger grandfather s name and her yard grandfather s name , into google , and then found them in the same book ( bondfield , @xcite ) !",
    "lorie s grandfather was in an american missionary and my grandfather was a canadian medical missionary .",
    "her parents were very political and they had a huge wealth of political literature . probably like the literature you , victor , grew up with .",
    "i  was a bit shy with them , and since they had all these magazines and books on the coffee table , i  could always check something out while i was listening .",
    "so , there was a very political side to it all , too .",
    "anyway , we fell in love and it s been good .",
    "almost 50 years now !",
    "people often say about us that we do nt need to talk , that we just simply communicate .",
    "lorie changed her career goals quite drastically after meeting me .",
    "if she had returned to antioch college , then i would have gone to yellow springs with her , probably to teach statistics .",
    "but in the meantime , i  completed my ph.d . and",
    "had applied for a post - doctoral fellowship at london , which i was awarded .",
    "lorie decided she preferred to go to london .",
    "she was actually studying british trade unions at oxford when i asked her to marry me , so she got back to england quite quickly .",
    "* victor : * indeed , you really dashed through your ph.d . in less than two years",
    "! how did that work ?",
    "did the lack of coursework requirements have anything to do with that ?",
    "* david : * i do nt think so .",
    "* victor : * i guess that your `` milli - brillingers '' had !    * david : * ( laughs ) aaaah , i  do nt know , i  guess tukey gave me a problem , and said , `` see what you can do with it . ''",
    "so , i  graduated that following may ( see figure  [ brill_phd ] )",
    ". why did nt he give me something like fermat s last theorem , i  do nt know !",
    "but i actually had a try at proving that in high school .",
    "i  read a lot of the history of mathematics .",
    "* victor : * i suppose nowadays in berkeley , as well as many other us universities , there is quite a bit of structure with a lot of coursework and exams .",
    "how do you compare those two different systems ?",
    "* david : * well freedman and i talked about that once .",
    "and we agreed that we would not have gone to berkeley , which is pathetic . but that s the system . plus , princeton was very selective when i went there , i  think",
    ", two statisticians admitted each year .",
    "* victor : * david cox once told me that the less structured approach is appropriate for the very brightest of students .",
    "* david : * yes , i  think so , but i certainly do nt claim to be a member of that group .    *",
    "victor : * what do you think happened with the princeton group ?",
    "* david : * from hearsay , i  think i can make a reasoned guess .",
    "tukey was a dominating figure .",
    "i  know he had tremendous respect for sam wilks , but i m not sure about some of the other people there . also , he had the mathematicians to contend with .",
    "yet , he needed people .",
    "he asked don fraser various times to go to princeton , he asked art dempster various times , he asked me several times .",
    "clearly , i  can only speak for myself .",
    "i  just wanted to do some things that were mine .",
    "it sounds selfish , but tukey was so dominant and so quick .",
    "i  do nt think that he thought any less of me because i refused .",
    "a lot of people were afraid of him .",
    "for example , if they had a cockeyed idea , he did nt mince words .",
    "he told me once that he thought the best way to get a scientific discussion going on something was to start an argument . now that s just the reverse of my personality .",
    "i  did see him do a lot of that .",
    "it was possible he wanted to get beyond the early pleasantries that go on .",
    "he did run over quite a number of people .",
    "he liked to argue and expected to win .",
    "i  think that he wanted to win because he had a goal and wanted to get there quickly .",
    "i  did love interacting with him during my thesis research .",
    "i  found i could communicate very easily with him . but",
    "still , i  felt a need to do my own thing .",
    "princeton did get a viable group at one point , and it became a department .",
    "the members included geoff watson , peter bloomfield and don mcneil .",
    "they each had a definite presence in the statistics world .",
    "however , i  think that peter bloomfield just got fed up with being department chair .",
    "so he went off to a large department at north carolina state .",
    "and mcneil went back to australia .",
    "also , i  gather that watson was treated quite terribly by the mathematics department .",
    "i  was very sad when geoff died for he had spoken truth many times .",
    "eventually , tukey was the only senior person left and when he retired the department went away .",
    "so , it is a sad story , but part of princeton s strength in statistics was that the people it was producing for many years came through mathematics , so there was no messing with them in terms of mathematical stuff , but yet these people wanted to apply mathematics as opposed to doing research in some mathematical specialty . to deviate from the present topic slightly ,",
    "i  have long found classical applied mathematics a bit boring and old - fashioned , but i do know that fisher wrote that , `` statistics is essentially a branch of applied mathematics '' ( fisher , @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays , one might say that statistics is a combination of applied mathematics and applied computing , the two driving the field .",
    "a princeton review committee was set up , and recommended against continuing the statistics department , and that was that .",
    "but i did have a lot of fun at princeton .",
    "* victor : * could you please tell us a bit about your summers at bell labs ?",
    "* david : * the first summer in grad school , there was a group of us from princeton that had summer jobs at bell labs .",
    "i  would drive up there with my friend carl riehm , an engineer and a logician .",
    "i  do nt know if the labs had this program to find future employees or if it was just a good deed for science .",
    "i  had learned some computing at toronto on their ibm 650 .",
    "toronto had these computing services very early on , for example , they had a feranti from the mid 50s .",
    "so , i  had started out learning computing in a course in the physics department .",
    "this was before fortran existed , so we were using machine language .",
    "princeton had a 650 also , which i did nt really use that much ",
    "i guess i was a lot more interested in group theory then .",
    "but when i went to my summer job at bell labs , they had an ibm 701 .",
    "fortran got created and so they had me programming various things for tukey . that was pretty much the story during my first summer ; it was nice to make the money .",
    "then , the second summer@xmath0 let s think@xmath0 i  guess the second summer lorie had appeared on the scene !",
    "so , we had a lot of fun .",
    "i  think that s when tukey had me writing some programs involved in discriminating earthquakes from underground explosions .",
    "he was then involved in the geneva negotiations for a nuclear test ban treaty with the russians .",
    "tukey had one of those out of the box ideas , the cepstrum .",
    "he thought this might also work for pitch detection .",
    "that s what i was doing .",
    "specifically , taking speech signal , digitizing it , doing things to it on the computer , then reconstituting it and listening to it . really , the spectrum and a lot of these time series things had a real meaning for me at that point .",
    "i  also golfed a lot .",
    "the labs had a short 3 hole course .",
    "* victor : * you got experience with getting your hands dirty with data .",
    "* david : * oh yes , right away .",
    "i  really loved that .",
    "but , more importantly , i  got exposed to a whole cast of characters creating exploratory data analysis !",
    "john tukey was the leader , obviously .",
    "but there were others right up there with him , martin wilk , in particular  he wrote some important papers with john .",
    "there were also roger pinkam , bill williams my buddy , dick hamming , ram gnanadesikan , colin mallows who had a strong influence on me .",
    "i  was in an office with colin so that was enjoyable and educational .",
    "and lunch was where i became a statistician , really .",
    "the whole group of us would go down to the cafeteria and sit around a big circular table .",
    "so , lunch was about this communal group trying to help each other with their scientific and statistical problems .",
    "then , people would go back to their offices and do their own things .",
    "i  mean the old bell labs worked wonderfully and it s just pathetic that it went away . there was an open door policy and everybody shared the problem they were working on .",
    "we had a lot of fun playing pranks up there , too .",
    "you know , it was all a gentler world back then in the early 60s .",
    "it had an incredible influence on my becoming a statistician because really they were creating a lot of applied statistics .",
    "i  was very lucky .",
    "i  mean i got onto a pretty good escalator going up .",
    "you do nt realize at that time how special it all is scientifically and socially .",
    "when i ve talked to some of the other bell labs people , we ve all said , `` those were magic years , '' and that we were so lucky to be right in the middle of them .",
    "bell labs was clearly years ahead of people in digital signal processing .",
    "tukey coming up with the fast fourier transform was just part of it .",
    "he was working on eda methods too@xmath1 .",
    "* victor : * did you `` witness '' the fft being developed ?",
    "* david : * tukey s form , yes . in his time series course , john had some way of doing it by complex demodulation .",
    "filtering this and filtering that and then putting things together .",
    "but one day in 63 , he turned up at a class with an iterative algebraic approach to computing the discrete fourier transform for the case when one could factor the number of observations into a product of two integers ( tukey , @xcite ) .",
    "it turned out that f.  yates and i.  j. good had a  related way for getting the effects in factorial experiments .",
    "the fft idea switched a lot of bell labs effort from analogue to digital signal processing .",
    "it was wonderful to be there .",
    "it gave me things to do in statistics .",
    "the people involved got to be five years , maybe even more , ahead of the rest of the world .",
    "* victor : * how did england come about ?",
    "* david : * well , part of the canadian educational perspective  and maybe you felt this too even though you are from greece  was that your education was nt complete until you spent some time in england .",
    "it was that simple .",
    "so , i  finished my doctorate , applied for a post - doc and got one ! and",
    "then lorie and i were off to england and to the london school of economics . actually , come to think of it , i ve applied for only one job in my life that i was nt offered .",
    "see i ve been in the navy , and then lorie and i met up .",
    "she had strong political beliefs and i had strong social ones . both of us were concerned with doing things about poverty and helping the developing world .",
    "so , i  applied for a job at the united nations ",
    "they were advertising for a statistician .",
    "did nt even get interviewed ! did nt get it !",
    "sometimes i think of how different our lives would have been .",
    "it is impossible to know , but things have certainly worked out .",

    "* victor : * but you ve been involved in the international statistical institute , which has this attitude of solidarity too .    * david : * oh , yes , definitely ! that s been traditional and i m glad i ve had the chance to get involved in that .",
    "anyway , england was about completing my education and i guess something led me to the london school of economics .",
    "i  am not sure just what it was , but that was wonderful . because kendall had just retired but was still around , jim durbin had just become a professor , alan stuart was about to become one too , maurice quenouille was a reader , claus moser was a professor , as was r. g. d. allen .",
    "i  was surrounded by these senior people who were right in the middle of analyzing fundamental economic and political structures .",

    "* victor : * was there any difficulty in adjusting to the british view on statistics , having been raised to the american attitude ?    * david : * no , not really .",
    "i  mean in toronto then there was a very british background culture there .",

    "i  think i was different from the other british statisticians at the time , however , as i knew a fair amount of mathematics .",
    "nowadays there are a lot of british statisticians who know a lot of mathematics .",

    "i  was honored to be asked to speak at his 65th birthday .",
    "i  paid a lot of attention to what david cox , maurice bartlett and george barnard had to say , in particular .",
    "the way the meetings worked back then was that people could get the galleys of a meeting s paper before it was presented .",
    "so , you could compete with all these famous guys .",
    "you could read the papers and see if you had something to add to the discussion .",
    "that was a lot of fun .",
    "i m not sure whether they do that now .",
    "i  mean there certainly are discussions that go on .",
    "back then , it seemed mostly in a spirit of friendliness , but now there seems to be real antagonism in the discussions as well as in referees reports .",

    "so , a lot of my life has been working on something and then suddenly thinking , `` oh , yes , i ve seen something like that before@xmath0 '' that s a problem with changing universities : because in the princeton library , i  might have picked up some journal , but then having moved on to , say , lse , i  had to search seriously .",
    "anyway , i  would pick up some journal , and read a paper that i sought in it , then , just as i was taught to read the dictionary , i d look at the paper just before and the paper just after .",
    "that way you build up your knowledge . also , when i  have a journal issue in my hand , i  do nt think i read it to study it ; rather , i  read it to enjoy it .",

    "we were of about the same age , having kids at the same time , watching the same tv programs .",
    "when monty python came along , we would all be talking about it the following monday morning .",
    "they were teaching me about football / soccer and were learning about hockey and frisbee from alastair scott and me .",

    "fred smith became the president of the royal statistical society , alastair scott went back to new zealand and was elected to the royal society of new zealand , graham karlton moved to the survey research center at the university of michigan and became prominent in the us survey community , wynn lewis died young , ken wallace , the econometrician among us , was elected a fellow of the british academy ( most of the lse statistics group in fall 1969 are pictured and listed in figure  [ lse ] ) .",

    ", it was doing factor analysis with time series , getting latent values of spectral density matrices .",
    "i  had in mind the problems tukey had had me thinking about , concerning a signal from an earthquake or an explosion coming across an array of sensors . in an appendix , there was a derivation of approximate distributions of spectral estimates using prolate spheroidal functions , which pollack and slepian had come up with ( slepian and pollack , @xcite ) .",

    "i mean back then i did nt know about protesting an editor s or referee s decision .",
    "i  probably should have rewritten it and sent it back to jrssb , but what does it matter ?",
    "i did give a talk at an rss meeting .",
    "eventually , i  put it on my website , and it s still there now .",
    "i  developed the dimension reduction aspect further and have a  paper on that in one of the multivariate analysis symposia and a chapter in my book .",

    "* david : * @xmath1there s another thing that s wrong with bureaucracy ! ( both laugh ) but anyway ,",
    "i  mean i was into all this nonlinear stuff .",
    "tukey , in an early memorandum , had done something on the bispectrum .",
    "so that motivated me to do some research .",
    "you know , when you have a math background you seek to generalize things , to abstract them .",
    "it turned out i was unknowingly at first competing with the russians  like sinai and kolmogorov ",
    "when i was doing that work .",
    "i  heard that kolmogorov had said some nice things about my work from igor zurbenko .",
    "that was really nice .",
    "later on , the russians translated my book into russian .",
    "i  learned to read russian mathematics in a fashion , in particular , the works of leonov and shiryaev .",
    "that s what got me into the ergodicity results . for example , what i talked about today was the chandler wobble .",
    "arato , kolmogorov and sinai had a paper using stochastic differential equations to explain that motion ( arato , kolmogorov and sinai , @xcite ) .",
    "i  was strongly influenced by french mathematics and a lot by russian probability .",
    "i  read the journals of both regularly .",
    "the work on cumulant functions and polyspectra let me get away from the restrictive assumption of gaussianity in much of my later research .",
    "* victor : * then , into the picture must have come murray rosenblatt , judging from your three joint papers on higher order spectra ( brillinger and rosenblatt , @xcite ) .",
    "i  suppose he was in touch with the russian school .",
    "* david : * oh yes , for sure .",
    "i  had met murray in new jersey when he consulted at bell labs in 1963 .",
    "i  remember they had him working on the cepstrum , which is the inverse fourier transform of the log of the spectrum . that work was part of estimating how deep earthquakes and explosions were , and so on .",
    "then , murray came to london . and",
    "again , i  did nt know i should nt do something like this , being a young jerk , but i just went up to murray and said something like , `` how about we write a paper and do some work together ? '' and he said , `` fine . '' murray has been my statistical role model , in many senses .",
    "tukey was a creative role model .",
    "but at one point he said , `` well , david , now that you are finishing , what do you think you want to do ? ''",
    "he might have thought that i still wanted to become an actuary .",
    "what just came out of my mouth was , `` i  really do nt want a life like what you have and i am concerned about whether i want to be an academic . ''",
    "and then tukey put his hands on his chin as he would often do and said , `` what about willy feller ?",
    "he has a pretty good life . ''",
    "so , he found a role model more to my liking .",
    "but then , i  found murray rosenblatt .",
    "he just seemed to love his wife and his kids and had a lot going on in his life outside academia as well as a fine academic career .",
    "so he was a good role model .",
    "i  do nt think i really managed to express that to him until richard davis and i interviewed him for that article in _ statistical science _",
    "( brillinger and davis , @xcite ; see figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "he was a lot more of a mathematician than me , but in terms of his life , and interacting with people , i  respected him .    *",
    "victor : * am i right that you also met emanuel parzen in england ?",
    "* david : * oh yes , and we ve been continually in touch since ( see figure  [ fig9 ] ) !",
    "we also met the chernoffs then .",
    "this year , 2010 , manny and carol are moving back to palo alto to a retirement home .",
    "so we expect to see a lot of them even though palo alto and stanford have gotten steadily farther apart during our berkeley years , in part because of the growth in traffic .",
    "but , with the parzens moving there , i  expect palo alto to come much closer . manny and carol are role models for us in different ways .",
    "one is being a loving couple that were equal , with each member of the couple helping the other . and",
    "the other is manny certainly helped me a lot by getting invitations to conferences , and by describing research that someone else was doing , so i was being kept up .",
    "and i think also by describing my research to other people .",
    "he was really the troubadour who was carrying the information of what was going on in other places around .",
    "* victor : * while maintaining a very strong concentration on cumulants and polymeasures , you also did some things on economics on the side .",
    "* david : * bell labs had a lot of signal processing , so i  was going into spectral analysis in detail .",
    "i  think kolmogorov and sinai defined cumulant spectra in some sense , or cumulant functions .",
    "these functions turned out to provide a natural way to describe ergodicity and asymptotic independence .",
    "that s what i grabbed on to . that was the 65 paper .",
    "i  think i might have been the first one to show that spectral estimates were asymptotically gaussian without assuming that the time series itself was gaussian .",
    "the economic work started in princeton .",
    "clive granger ",
    "the nobel prize winner  was at princeton before i went to london .",
    "he and michio hatanaka were working on a book on spectrum analysis of economic series with john tukey providing advice .",

    "hatanaka and i began working together and wrote a paper ( brillinger and hatanaka , @xcite ) .",
    "i  presented the work as an invited talk at the first world econometric meeting in rome in 1965 .",
    "milton friedman made the invitation .",
    "the work was concerned with the permanent income hypothesis and we had developed a time series spectral analysis formulation .",
    "after the talk , friedman came up and said something like : `` i did nt understand any of that",
    "but i am sure it was good ! '' ( laughing ) there is another paper with michio ( brillinger and hatanaka , @xcite ) .",
    "data analyses were involved .",
    "my period at the lse was by far the most theoretical in my career .",
    "i  think because the time series data just were nt there .",
    "i  was working as a consultant with the seismology group at blackness .",
    "it was an offshoot of the aldermaston atomic weapons research establishment outside that base .",
    "at one point , i  provided an effective scheme for them to use with array data , but i guess that i was nt able to explain it well enough . that s often been the story of my ideas .",
    "i  do nt know , manny parzen once quoted someone as saying , `` first you have an idea and then you go out and sell it . ''",
    "but that was never me .",
    "i  do try to ask myself , `` why am i writing this paper ? '' in the end , i  think that i am writing for john tukey .",

    "* victor : * chomsky ?",
    "* david : * yes , chomsky !",
    "i took chomsky out for coffee once .",
    "it turned out that he and tukey had organized a seminar on linguistics at the institute for advanced study .",
    "this was when i was doing all these memorial articles about tukey ( brillinger , @xcite ) .",
    "i  had noticed that chomsky came to berkeley regularly .",
    "so , i  called a mutual friend and asked if they could arrange for a meeting next time chomsky was in berkeley .",
    "they did . eventually , i  met chomsky at the linguistics department and took him over to this coffee place run by palestinians .",
    "victor , you have been there . while we were there , all these people were looking at chomsky .",
    "one woman could nt resist expressing her admiration for his work .",
    "he was such a humble , sweet person .",
    "i  asked him whether tukey had any impact on the seminar .",
    "chomsky said he sat there and grinned .",
    "i  guess one takes that for what it is !",
    "so , being a tukey student has given me entre to countless situations .",
    "i ll tell you a story concerning that : just as i was finishing my studies at princeton , i  was invited to speak at the university of michigan ",
    "i am sure due to tukey interacting with jimmy savage .",
    "jimmy savage did a bit of political analysis of lorie and me , and decided that our politics were on the left .",
    "he quickly organized for us to meet with leslie kish , sociologist in the survey research center . that s when our close friendship started",
    ".    * victor : * leslie kish had fought as a volunteer in the spanish civil war .    * david : * that s right , and he was a leader of the campaign for a sane nuclear policy .",
    "so , leslie had come to london and was giving a talk somewhere there .",
    "he later told me that he saw that i was in the last row doing something else .",
    "he said he got annoyed , but then immediately thought , `` oh no , he is a tukey student , so that s all right ! '' ( laughs ) now actually i was listening !",
    "tukey could do three things at a time , i  could maybe do two , sometimes .",
    "* victor : * another name you often mentioned is david cox .    *",
    "david : * oh , yes , he is another hero of mine .",
    "he too visited bell labs when i was working there .",
    "he was not a professor yet .",
    "he clearly had special things to say .",
    "others might have done some of the things he did in a more mathematical way and subsequently gotten their names attached to them .",
    "i  do nt think he had a problem with that .",
    "i  am thinking of things like getting approximate distributions of maximum likelihood estimators when the model is incorrect .",
    "he did that early on in a berkeley symposium paper ( cox , @xcite ) .",
    "then , in another berkeley symposium , huber came along and did it in a more formal way .",
    "cox s paper has a wonderful statement , `` discussion of regularity conditions will not be attempted . ''",
    "there were very few , if any , of david s talks or papers that did nt have something clever in them .",
    "it s as if when he did something , if there was nt anything clever in it ( david thrusts his hand as if throwing away a piece of paper ) , then , no ! out of the window .",
    "he does it all in a very humble way .",
    "i  have been on several committees with him and he would say few things for a while , but he would accumulate information and then he would come up with a proposition : `` well you could say @xmath1 maybe we could do@xmath0 '' and everybody would agree . he could merge a lot of different opinions and information .",
    "he is one of my statistical heroes .",
    "he did reject a couple of papers that i  submitted to _",
    "biometrika_. i  took that as saying , you can do better .",
    "* victor : * i understand that you would have been  very happy to stay in london , but then things changed .    * david : * yes , well my mother retired .",
    "she had had a  hard life .",
    "she was a very bright woman , but because my maternal grandfather died in the great flu epidemic leaving my grandmother with five children , my mother had to go to typing school to help the family survive .",
    "many years later , she went to adult school and got to be a country schoolteacher .",
    "we were sending her some money , but when she retired her pension was tiny .",
    "even though i had become a reader at lse , there was just no way i made enough to make up what she needed .",
    "we had jef and matthew at that point , we were living quite happily , had a nice house a block away from wimbledon common .",
    "we were going to the theatre and concerts regularly .",
    "but there just was no way to be able to also support my mother .",
    "so i had to look for a higher income .",
    "berkeley had already invited me several times .",
    "actually , david blackwell had called me just before i finished at princeton ( see also figure  [ fig10 ] ) . now in the late sixties berkeley was the place to be , with the free speech movement , rock concerts , experimentation in the arts and all that .",
    "we had learned that when we were there on sabbatical in 6768 . there were a growing number of protests against the vietnam war , and lorie was quite involved .",
    "so we knew berkeley , and they knew me . and when henry scheff asked me about moving there , we agreed .",
    "a person high in the academic totem pole told me once that a senior department member had said that i was the most influential appointment in the  70s .",
    "there were lots of mathematical things going on and i enjoyed that , but i was strongly interested in applications of mathematics .",
    "i  immediately fell into place with lucien le cam and jerzy neyman and all their visitors  they had a lot of important ones .",
    "so , we left london because we needed a higher income , but we landed in a very special place .",
    "our older son , jef , loved england .",
    "he was very sad about the move and that made lorie and me sad .",
    "i  think we expected that eventually he would move there .",
    "* victor : * so tell us a bit about your early berkeley years .    * david : * the earliest years were 6768 when i was a visitor on leave from lse and we have already talked about them .",
    "we moved to berkeley permanently , arriving by ship , in january 1970 to be met by erich lehmann on one of the piers . at that time",
    ", there were a number of individuals who were then assistant professors but who did not get promoted to tenure , that is , had to pack their bags and leave town .",
    "they were able academics so their nonretention was quite a shock for me .",
    "actually , it seemed inhumane .",
    "some of these people had children already at school .",
    "i  was used to the english system where , if you were a lecturer , and you had passed across the bar after three years , then you had tenure .",
    "you would hit the top salary of the lecturer scale but you might stay in your department the rest of your career  you had tenure .",
    "some people did take advantage of that .",
    "we lost berkeley friends that we had made and that was a great shock .",
    "apart from that , we were really enjoying the department , berkeley and the bay area .",
    "the department seminars and the quality of the discussions in the lunch room were top notch . in these early years",
    "kjell doksum and his family became close friends .",
    "* victor : * did you thus quickly forget about london ?",
    "* david : * no , not really .",
    "in fact , when in 1971 david cox wrote that a professorial chair was available at imperial college , and asked if i was interested , i  was very interested ! but going through the sums , with alan stuart s help , we just could not afford to return .",
    "our old house was now worth more than twice as much as we had sold it for , within that short period .",
    "we could nt afford to buy a comparable house .",
    "i have sometimes wondered how things would have worked out with jef s brain tumor had we returned .",
    "cormack had just developed the first ct scanner at atkinson morley hospital just down the hill from our wimbledon house . that technology was nt yet available in the us , and",
    "might have helped .",
    "* victor : * but you found data at berkeley .",
    "* david : * yes , i  found data and fine applied scientists to work with at berkeley . on reflection",
    ", i  had reached the career that tukey and bell labs had been training me for . soon after arrival",
    ", i  just wandered over to the seismographic station where i met this australian fellow , bruce bolt .",
    "he and his family became dear friends .",
    "he was a sailor also , so we spent time on the bay in his boat .",
    "our families mingled .",
    "bruce was religious , and i was no longer .",
    "however , we did nt seem to have the slightest difficulty talking about religion and other serious topics .",
    "he got me working on time series and other problems in seismology .",
    "we wrote several joint papers , but affected each other s research quite generally .",
    "* victor : * was that around the time you wrote your invited paper on point process identification ( brillinger , @xcite ) ?    * david : * there is a history to my work on point processes both in london and berkeley .",
    "david vere - jones , another dear friend , another influence , presented an invited paper at a meeting of the royal statistical society ( vere - jones , @xcite ) .",
    "i  was asked to second the vote of thanks . when you are the seconder you are supposed to criticize the paper s content .",
    "victor , you ve probably been to these things .",
    "so i read david s very seriously .",
    "i  do nt think i had much in the way of criticizing , but it got me very interested in temporal point processes .    at berkeley , neyman and scott",
    "had done path breaking work on spatial point processes , particularly in astronomy .",
    "six months after my arrival in berkeley in january , the sixth berkeley symposium took place .",

    "i also had a student , tore schweder , who was looking into that point process material when modeling whale tracks .",
    "to continue the story , while betty scott was still department chair she asked me if there was anyone it would be good to invite to berkeley for a term .",

    "and he had all these wonderful data on nerve cells firing .",
    "and i just said , well this model that i have been fitting for earthquakes might be good .",
    "so then he sent me these massive piles of boxes of computer cards !",
    "they took up perhaps 10% of my office for many years !",
    "the thing that was interesting was that second - order spectral analysis seemed to be quite effective .",
    "so , i  was working on point process data from seismology and point process data from neurophysiology at the same time .",
    "my students rice and akisik worked on these models / data also .",
    "the advantage of the neurophysiology case was that it was a designed experiment situation and , thus , you could repeat the experiment .",
    "so , that collaboration resulted because i was working on point processes from seismology . to my mind , one of the major successes was that the concept of partial coherency analysis could be extended quite directly to the point process case ( brillinger , @xcite ) , and it let one infer the causal structure of networks of neurons ( brillinger , bryant and segundo , @xcite ) .",

    "david : * as far as i was concerned , being around him was a treat .",
    "one of neyman s goals was `` to find a model describing the data . '' in contrast , tukey s goal was to `` discover surprises in the data . ''",
    "neyman was more for formalization , whereas tukey was more for intuition .",
    "surely , both are needed .",
    "i  saw the two masters of these things at work ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "i  attended the neyman seminar regularly and went for drinks afterward .",
    "neyman had a host of really wonderful visitors coming to berkeley .",
    "i  had total respect for that man .",
    "* victor : * and neyman was one of the people you had gotten closer with , along with le cam and scott ?    * david : * yes . for one thing , they were always in the coffee room at lunch time , often with famous visitors eating neyman s hard boiled eggs .",

    "the three schools are all right .",
    "we need each .",
    "i  think it is important for people to travel and experience all three .",

    "one meets these people and compares their discussions of the same paper .",
    "a lot of things exist in the scientific air , but are not written down , particularly heuristics . and",
    "it s very important to have heuristics along the way to nailing a  problem down",
    ". often , when you go to another center and are in a discussion , they quickly draw a little diagram and then you have picked that representation up .",
    "the thing is that you could go a whole career and never know that something could be simplified that much .",
    "as the years have passed , the british statistics school has become a lot more american .",
    "for example , consider measure theory and theorems .",
    "there have always been a lot of wonderful probabilists in england , but they did not appear to have much influence on the statisticians until recently .",
    "one thing that i particularly respect about the english system , including people who are nt famous , is how well they can ask questions .",
    "there would be someone at a seminar , and then there would often be someone with a british accent who would put their finger on a crucial point that s going on in the science .",
    "not so much the mathematics , but the science of the situation .",
    "i  have a lot of respect for that .",
    "what was the encounter like ?",

    "there were some surprising benefits , like not having to do much preparation for lectures for many years .",
    "the thing that i enjoyed the very most was making up the problems at the ends of the chapters .",
    "because i d be thinking , `` maybe there is a problem sort of like this , '' or `` maybe reasonable assumptions are something like these , '' and last `` maybe a solution could go as follows . ''",

    "perhaps trajectories , perhaps point processes , perhaps spatial - temporal data and so on .",
    "i  think if you are not excited about something , or if it is something you have done a long time ago , it s boring .",

    "it was nt that we did nt want to or could nt , we just seemed to get talking about other things .",

    "i  can provide a lot of evidence about that and i think it is what places the berkeley students in a good position when they finish . because other places will create students who are really up to date the moment they finish , but not ready for new things that come along .",
    "it s harder for them to keep on top of things",
    ". they may well feel intimidated and struggling to keep up .",
    "i  think the students coming to berkeley get a lot of gifts from the people here .",
    "one can mention le  cam with his abstract approach to things and depth of thought .",
    "i  had great respect for him for a lot of reasons .",
    "one of them is he could sit in his office and he could dream of these incredible mathematical problems , and dream up solutions . whereas my thing to do is to find a parallel scientific situation where that problem exists .",
    "this can give important clues about how to approach the problem .",
    "lucien always seemed able to generalize these things in such a way that he would encompass so many things .",
    "i  would take some of his work and particularize it to a specific situation .",
    "* victor : * is that your research strategy ?",
    "how do you attack problems ? how do you find or choose them ?",
    "* david : * i find them by people interacting with me , or by my asking them .",
    "as i mentioned earlier , when i  arrived in berkeley , i  went over to the seismographic station .",
    "they did nt come to me .",
    "i  think that with a consulting service you do nt really get the special people coming .",
    "you have to go over to them , to the scientists .",
    "you have to present yourself to them .",
    "terry speed and i agreed on this once .",
    "terry was chasing across campus some time after he arrived , interacting with people , particularly in biology .",
    "when i think about my recent work : risk analysis was motivated by interactions with bruce bolt of the seismographic stations , the trajectory modeling was based on data collected by brent stewart of hubbs sea world , while both topics involved alan ager and haiganoush preisler of the us forest service .",
    "the work on sports statistics is based on data that i collected on my own . at a certain point you ve got all the problems you can handle .",
    "it seems in any case that if you want to work with good people , then you have to go after them .",
    "so i ve just come to know a lot of people .",
    "various of my papers may be found in ( guttorp , @xcite ) .",
    "now , i  am a member of the scientific of advisory panel this new center of excellence for evolutionary biology at the university of oslo , and there is a flood of new problems coming into my head from that .",
    "it is just wonderful .",
    "but i was wondering : why me on this panel ?",
    "and then i thought , `` oh , evolution , that is time - series , is nt it ? ''",
    "it is just a totally different group of scientists from any i have been involved with before .",
    "now i own a great thick book on evolutionary biology .",
    "* victor : * in a recent article ( dyson , @xcite ) , freeman dyson classifies mathematicians as frogs and birds ; or as erich lehmann put it ( lehman , @xcite ) : problem solvers and system builders . where do you stand ?",
    "* david : * i like to be a bit of both .",
    "i  like solving problems , but yet from my math background i like to abstract things .",
    "i  like to transfer information between fields .",
    "so , i  have worked at the same time with a seismologist , bruce bolt , and with a neuroscientist , walter freeman .",
    "walter works with eeg ( electroencephalogram ) analysis .",
    "i  would be telling walter some of the clever things the seismologists were doing and i would be telling bruce some of the clever things that the neuroscientists were doing .",
    "they each could then be thinking of applying these things to their own data .",
    "abstraction was the route between the two fields .",
    "transfer of knowledge is a  topical goal and the politicians like it a  lot .",
    "it probably makes sense because you can `` start sooner '' in a different field .",
    "dyson by the way is another hero .",
    "i  think i read various of his books and papers .",
    "i  used to look a lot at the physics literature .",
    "* victor : * do you have a favorite paper ?    *",
    "david : * i believe that my favorite papers are the ones that i had to work the hardest to get the result .",
    "i  believe i told you i had solved all the problems , except one , in sam wilks book .",
    "the one which was about getting an asymptotic joint distribution of the median and the mean .",
    "i  did not know how to get that and when i told sam i do nt think he knew how either .",
    "he said he had found the result in a paper by some hungarians .",
    "i  never found that paper either .",
    "eventually , i  ran into the notions of strong approximations , later called coupling , and read a report by ron pyke  another role model of mine  and one of his students , on getting a strong approximation for the empirical cdf using tied down brownian motion .",
    "but for the problem i was concerned with , i  needed an error term .",
    "i  think i was the first to set down that approximation with an error term .",
    "the hungarians then referred to my work and generalized it to get a lot of wonderful results .",
    "* victor : * you re referring to your early _ bulletin of the ams _ paper on the representation of an empirical distribution function ( brillinger , @xcite ) ?    * david : * that s right .",
    "that s one of my favorites .",
    "it just opened up a whole host of things .",
    "then , of course , when you get such a result you can improve it a great deal .",
    "but this strong approximation just lets you write down results using standard calculus .",
    "that was an important one to me .",
    "* victor : * and what about a `` favorite rejected paper , '' or , to put it differently , is there an instance when you might have felt angry at a referee ?    *",
    "david : * no , never anger at an academic referee , sometimes anger at a soccer referee ( victor laughs ) .",
    "i  had a paper once , that i thought was quite interesting , on a representation for polymeasures .",
    "so polymeasures do relate to polyspectra , but really it was more useful for nonlinear operators .",
    "i  mean there s this huge world of linear operators , but polymeasures provide you with representations for an important class of polynomial operators . and",
    "then , since i was just about to move to england , i  thought it would make sense to send it to the _ journal of the london mathematical society_. to this day , i  think that if i had actually been at lse and sent it from there , they would have accepted it .",
    "but i  just got a  referee s report back saying that they were just not interested in that type of paper .",
    "i  was young , i  was learning .",
    "i  still had the attitude that i d rather be playing hockey than doing this stuff , and that stood me a good stead .",
    "really , that s not made up .",
    "plus , i  had tukey telling me that he had many papers rejected .",
    "i  think i read somewhere that rob tibshirani said that his first ten papers were rejected .",
    "tukey s thing was resubmit somewhere else .",
    "i  sent it to the _ proceedings of the american mathematical society _ and they accepted it directly ( brillinger , @xcite ) .",
    "tukey and i had a paper rejected by two journals ( brillinger and tukey , @xcite ) .",
    "he told me not to worry , it could appear in his _ collected works _ , and it did .",
    "* victor : * going in the other direction , was there a  paper that you found had much more impact than what you would have expected ?",
    "* david : * i just love to do math problems .",
    "all through high school and university , there were problems from the _ american mathematical monthly _ that i would try to solve .",
    "so , i  was doing it for my amusement . you know",
    ", you could send a solution and sometimes they would publish it .",
    "so , i  think in many cases that s why i  was doing things : there was a  problem , and i was there .",
    "so , the polyspectra paper ( brillinger , @xcite ) just started out from having fun .",
    "i  found that cumulants were a way to go .",
    "they had this property that , if there was a multivariate variable , and if some set of its variables was independent of the rest , then the joint cumulant was zero .",
    "this takes one directly to a definition of mixing for general stationary processes .",
    "perhaps the russians knew that result , but anyway .",
    "but i was working on this for fun . at one point",
    ", tukey mentioned the word , polyspectra , and i made the connection  and wrote that paper .",
    "that paper might have helped me get some invitations to speak and job offers and promotions .",
    "it surely led to my collaborating with murray rosenblatt .",
    "* victor : * well , it s been cited over 200 times , i  think !    * david : * i remember i gave a talk on that research at cambridge .",
    "david kendall , whose work you know well , had invited me .",
    "when i was done with the talk , i  think he was as baffled as most other people were by what i was up to .",
    "maybe i was just not good at explaining it .",
    "hopefully , i  eventually learned how to do so .",
    "anyway , kendall said something like , `` now let s go have some poly - tea in our poly - cups . ''",
    "so that broke the ice ( laughs ) .",
    "most of these great people have a sense of humor .",
    "they can seem pretty serious because one has to think hard to do the research .",
    "but you realize that basically they re people who have families , and have fun with their children at the playground .",
    "there is a human side to all of them .",
    "so , in the beginning , very few people would refer to that paper at all .",
    "i  think kolmogorov knew about it , and i had a bit of an interaction with zurbenko about it .",
    "but that was pretty much it .",
    "but then , in the early 80s all of a sudden i get this flood of reprint requests ! this was when people still used reprints , they did nt have things on the web . and",
    "so , all of a sudden i m being invited to these conferences , some of them in exotic places , on `` higher order spectra''that s what they called it .",
    "my preference is cumulant spectra .",
    "i  remember saying things at some of these conferences , like , `` nothing matters unless you show it used on a real data set . ''",
    "and i remember seeing some of the engineers looking at each other .",
    "because in so many cases they would tend to use proof by simulation .",
    "that gave them the feeling they had done their duty in terms of a proof .",
    "i  do nt put them down , i  have a huge amount of respect for engineers .",
    "my favorite committees are engineering committees because they have something better to do than being on the committees ! and they have this attitude , that allin cornell , an earthquake engineer expressed to me once , the attitude that every engineering problem has a solution . and",
    "i  think tukey was showing me that many times over in the form that every statistics problem has a solution . and that it s the statistician s responsibility to find it .",
    "you ca nt just abandon a scientist and their data .",
    "* victor : * on your office door in evans hall there is a sticker : @xmath4 .",
    "would you care to elaborate on this for the uninitiated ?",
    "* david : * oh well , yes , that s my logo !",
    "i usually like to make people figure it out .",
    "it goes back a long way . here",
    "s one story : this student , raffa ( irizarry ) whom i  have mentioned already , was just a joy .",
    "i  would hear loud footsteps of someone running down the corridor toward my office .",
    "and then raffa would appear , slide me off my chair , and open a window on my computer saying , `` you have got to see this ! ''",
    "one day he ran into my office saying , `` i found it !",
    "@xmath5 is not 1 ! ''",
    "he had discovered what was going wrong in his computations by simulating the basic procedure countless times for a known case .",
    "his answer was out by a multiple of @xmath5 .",
    "raffa was already a  modern statistician using mathematica and simulation to deal with analytic problems . by the way",
    ", he just received copss young statisticians award .",
    "that made me very proud .",
    "peter guttorp just got an honorary degree from his home university of lund .",
    "the grad students have been my great joy at berkeley .",
    "ross ihaka received the pickering medal in new zealand for his work in developing the statistical package ` r ` .",
    "others too .",
    "i  mean my students make me proud for their research and professional contributions .",
    "john rice has excelled in those two areas and just completed a second successful term as our department chair .",
    "they are grandchildren of tukey s , and a lot of what they are getting from me is what i learned from tukey .",
    "for example , you ve seen me filing papers with these plastic ziplock bags ?",
    "well this is a tukey idea from many years ago !",
    "victor , does stephan ( morgenthaler ) ever do that ?",
    "* victor : * i do nt recall , i ll make sure to check !",
    "* david : * well , you can tease him about it . if he says no , tell him that brillinger says he would have a better career using these bags !",
    "he will have an answer to that , i m sure ( both laugh ) !",
    "* victor : * churchill ( churchill , @xcite , p. 17 ) wrote something like , `` all students should learn english , and then the clever ones should take latin as an honour and greek as a treat . ''",
    "translated into mathematical or statistical topics , what would be your pick ?",
    "* david : * you could probably ask me that five times and get five totally different answers ! because right now i  think it s puzzles . as a youngster , i  was always doing problems in the newspaper , you know `` three men are in a room and they ca nt see what s on their own head@xmath1 '' and things like that .",
    "i  had a lot of fun in doing that and a lot of good intellectual exercise .",
    "perhaps the exercises in my book was the part i enjoyed most .",
    "it was the hardest part too .",
    "the things i had to work hardest on are the ones i respect the most .",
    "i  developed an estimation method and a paper once , on my bike ride home .",
    "i  had the idea , went to the typewriter upstairs , sat down , and typed it up .",
    "i  sent it to _ biological cybernetics _ directly ( brillinger , @xcite ) .",
    "all done in a couple of hours !",
    "that did nt impress me . then , there are some other things like how to handle the `` integrate and fire '' model in neuroscience ( brillinger and segundo , @xcite ) , which took quite a while to come along .",
    "* victor : * as we already mentioned , you will have supervised 40 ph.d .",
    "dissertations by next january . what would be your advice to the next generation ?",
    "* david : * it seems to me that learning mathematics is nowadays being replaced by learning computer science .",
    "i  think it would be good for students to learn near equal amounts of each of these .",
    "computer science lets one check out proposed methods , learn about data structures ",
    "after all the data are typically in a computer  and get approximate answers .",
    "but i am not sure it really takes you to the essence of a lot of situations .",
    "think of the neural net models .",
    "they can be justified by the science , as in the threshold case mentioned above .",
    "however , i  am uneasy about throwing everything in there and getting an answer without a scientific interpretation .",
    "i  would rather use something that has scientifically interpretable parameters .",
    "let me add , though , that i am certainly not averse to using some tool to see what it can do for me .",
    "i  would like to see students come back to studying more serious mathematics .",
    "i m astonished that some students in the computer science community do nt know elementary trigonometric identities . for them ,",
    "the fourier transform is just the fft : you put this in and you get this out .",
    "people learn a lot by just doing something and seeing what you get .",
    "that s a system identification approach where one inputs a signal and sees what comes out .",
    "i  think it is a lot more rewarding to really get some understanding of _ why _ it is happening .",
    "although in science it does nt always work that way .",
    "i  remember fred mosteller saying many years ago that nobody knew then why aspirin worked , but that of course we are going to use it because it appeared to work .",
    "but still i  think learning what the thing was doing is fundamental , because then you can improve on it .",
    "my bottom line is : have fun ! that sounds trite but i m serious .",
    "if you are worried about something , consider what you can do about it .",
    "if there is something , do it .",
    "if not , what s the point of worrying ? when you have a child die after a very long battle with cancer , as lorie and i did , you simplify a lot of things .",
    "you take things to their essence .",
    "do nt be afraid to cry .",
    "it is another thing you learn going through a tragedy .",
    "many say crying is hard sometimes . for me , it just happens .",
    "* victor : * david , thank you very much for sharing these memories of your remarkable life and career .",

    "* david : * oh yes ! ! ! ( laughs out loud )",
    "there is noooooo doubt in that !",
