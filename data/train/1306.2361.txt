    "the problems of transmit diversity selection ( tds ) and rs are formulated as joint discrete optimization problems , where rs refines the set from which tds is made ; leading to improved convergence , performance and complexity .",

    "the direct path is non - negligible and has an expected gain of a fraction of that of the indirect paths ; reflecting the increased distance and shadowing involved .",

    "further improvements can be achieved by a process we term rs . by removing one or more relays from consideration based on their mse performance ,",
    "the cardinality and quality @xmath48 is improved restricting the phase channels available to the tds process .",

    "we propose a complexity dsa which jointly optimizes rs and tds in accordance with ( [ eq : mmse_opt_function ] ) and ( [ eq : discrete_opt_rs ] ) , and converges to the optimal exhaustive solution .",
    "1    .proposed discrete stochastic algorithm [ cols= \" < \" , ]     [ tab : rs_algorithm ]    the rs portion of the dsa is given by the algorithm of table [ tab : rs_algorithm ] . at each iteration the mse of a randomly chosen candidate relay ( @xmath63 ) ( step 2 ) and that of the worst performing relay currently known ( @xmath64 ) are calculated ( step 3 ) . via a comparison ,",
    "the higher mse relay is designated @xmath64 for the next iteration ( step 3 ) . the current solution and the relay chosen for removal ( @xmath65 )",
    "is denoted as the current optimum and is the relay which has occupied @xmath66 most frequently over the course of the packet up to the @xmath67 time instant ; effectively an average of the occupiers of @xmath66 .",
    "this averaging / selection process is performed by allocating each member of @xmath56 a @xmath68 unit vector , @xmath69 , which has a one in its corresponding position in @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath70 $ ] is the label of the worst performing relay at the @xmath67 iteration . the current optimum is then chosen and tracked by means of a @xmath71 state occupation probability ( sop ) vector , @xmath72 .",
    "this vector is updated at each iteration by adding @xmath73 $ ] and subtracting the previous value of @xmath72 ( step 4 ) .",
    "the current optimum is then determined by selecting the largest element in @xmath72 and its corresponding entry in @xmath56 ( step 5 ) . through this process ,",
    "the current optimum converges towards and tracks the exhaustive solution @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the proposed algorithm is to view the transitions , @xmath74\\rightarrow r^{\\mathrm{w}}[i+1]$ ] , as a markov chain and the members of @xmath56 as the possible transition states .",
    "the current optimum can then be defined as the most visited state .",
    "once rs is complete at each time instant , set reduction ( @xmath75 , step 6 ) and tds can take place .",
    "to perform tds , modified versions of steps 1 - 5 are used .",
    "the considered set is replaced , @xmath76 ; the structure of interest is replaced , @xmath77 ; the best performing matrix is sought @xmath78 ; the sop vector is replaced @xmath79 and @xmath80 from ( [ eq : mmse_opt_function ] ) .",
    "finally , the inequality of step 3 is reversed to enable convergence to the lowest mse tds matrix which is the feedback to the relays .",
    "convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal exhaustive solution is dependent on the independence of the cost function observations and the satisfaction of @xmath81\\big]>\\mathcal{f}\\big[r[i]\\big]\\big\\ } > \\mathrm{pr}\\big\\{\\mathcal{f}\\big[r[i]\\big]>\\mathcal{f}\\big[r^{\\mathrm{opt}}[i]\\big]\\big\\ } $ ] and @xmath82\\big]>\\mathcal{f}\\big[r^{\\mathrm{c}}[i]\\big]\\big\\ } > \\mathrm{pr}\\big\\{\\mathcal{f}\\big[r[i]\\big]>\\mathcal{f}\\big[r^{\\mathrm{c}}[i]\\big]\\big\\ } $ ] for rs and tds ( with the afore mentioned modifications ) . in this work , to minimize complexity , independent observations are not used , therefore the proof of convergence is intractable . however",
    ", excellent convergence has been observed under these conditions in @xcite and throughout the simulations conducted for this work .",
    "significant complexity savings result from the proposed algorithm ; savings which increase with @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath59 . when @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath59 and @xmath85 , the number of complex multiplications for mmse reception and exhaustive tds , exhaustive tds with rs , iterative tds and iterative tds with rs are @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , for each time instant .",
    "in this section , simulations of the proposed algorithms ( iterative tds with rs ) are presented and comparisons drawn against the optimal exhaustive solutions ( exhaustive tds with rs ) , the unmodified system ( no tds ) , and the direct transmission ( non - cooperative ) . plots of the schemes with tds only ( exhaustive tds , iterative tds ) are also included to illustrate the performance improvement obtained by rs .",
    "equal power allocation is maintained in each phase , where @xmath90 when tds is employed and @xmath91 for the unmodified system .",
    "for the rls ce , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are initialized as identity matrices and the exponential forgetting factor is 0.9 .",
    "the initial values of @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are zeros matrices .",
    "each simulation is averaged over 1000 packets ( @xmath98 ) ; each made up @xmath0 of pilot symbols .",

    "[ fig : ber_ce ] gives the ber convergence performance of the proposed algorithms .",
    "the iterative tds with rs algorithm converges to the optimal ber as does tds with rs and ce , albeit in a delayed fashion due to the ce .",
    "the tds with rs scheme exhibits quicker convergence and lower steady state ber .",
    "these results and the interdependence between elements of the algorithm confirm that both the rs and tds portions of the algorithm converge to their exhaustive solutions but also the satisfaction of the probability conditions of section [ sec : proposed_algorithms ] .    # 1#21    fig . [ fig : snr ] shows the ber versus snr performance of the proposed and conventional algorithms .",
    "increased diversity has been achieved whilst maintaining @xmath99 , illustrating that although the maximum available diversity advantage decreases with rs with tds to @xmath100 , the actual diversity achieved has increased .",
    "these diversity effects can be attributed to the removal of poor paths which bring little benefit in terms of diversity , but also the increase in transmit power over the remaining paths .",
    "the largest gains in diversity are present in region and begin to diminish above this region because relay decoding becomes increasingly reliable and lower power paths become more viable for transmission .",
    "this work presented a joint dsa which combines tds and rs along with continuous ce for multi - relay cooperative mimo systems.the scheme exceeds the performance of systems which lack tds and matches that of the optimal exhaustive solution whilst saving considerable computational expense , making it ideal for realtime mobile use .",
