    "a central issue for the control and manipulation of electronic spin degrees of freedom in the field of molecular nanomagnetism@xcite and related areas is the understanding and characterization of the various microscopic mechanisms of relaxation and decoherence which stem from the interactions with the underlying degrees of freedom of the host lattice .",
    "it is by now well established that in the large majority of magnetic clusters , the relaxation of the magnetization shows a dramatic slowing down which sets in already at relatively high temperatures @xmath2 and is characterized by a single electronic frequency cutoff @xmath0@xcite .",
    "while the majority of freezing mechanisms reported in the literature [ e.g. , onsite anisotropy in single molecule magnets@xcite , anisotropy and critical fluctuations in single chain magnets@xcite , phonon trapping in ni@xmath3@xcite ] , have been understood to a large extent on the basis of the nature of the lowest excitations , the case of antiferromagnetic rings ( afmr s ) has been exceptional and very intriguing . indeed , as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments by baek _ _ et al.__@xcite , in the regime where the dramatic slowing down effect takes place , @xmath0 follows a near - universal power - law @xmath2 dependence with an exponent close to 4 , a behavior clearly inconsistent with a relaxation scenario based on the lowest excitation lines .",
    "it is also striking that the experimental curves of @xmath0 from various magnetic rings with different sizes and spins @xmath4 nearly coincide when @xmath2 is rescaled by the lowest spin gap @xmath1 .    on the theoretical side , the first microscopic calculation of @xmath0 in afmr",
    "s has been given by santini _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite who conclude on this problem that the relevant @xmath2 regime is too narrow to substantiate any power - law scaling and that instead @xmath0 is approximately exponential in @xmath5 .",
    "here we present a new microscopic theory which supports the scaling hypothesis of baek _",
    "et al._@xcite and resolves its physical origin in a clear and transparent way .",
    "our central key finding is that , in the severe slowing down @xmath2 regime , the relaxation is not governed by the lowest excitation lines of the quadrupolar spectral density but by a forest of quasi - continuum excitations at higher energies ( cf .",
    "[ overlap.fig ] ) .",
    "this is at the heart of the power - law temperature dependence of @xmath0 with an exponent which is close to 4 ( cf .",
    "( [ wc4.eq ] ) ) .",
    "the onset of this behavior is defined by an energy scale which is fixed by the lowest spin gap @xmath1 , and this explains why curves from different rings fall almost on top of each other when @xmath2 is rescaled by @xmath1 .",
    "the present theory is corroborated by a model calculation of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath6 which includes one - phonon , two - phonon as well as raman processes and shows excellent agreement with experimental data for the cr@xmath7 , fe@xmath8li and fe@xmath8na clusters .",
    "our theory is based on the formalism developed in ref .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is based on an analytical formula which gives @xmath0 in terms of a frequency overlap between an electronic and a phononic spectral density function [ cf .",
    "( [ wc1.eq ] ) or ( [ wc2.eq ] ) below ] .",
    "thus by monitoring the variation of these spectra with @xmath2 and @xmath9 one is able to identify the dominant relaxation channels in each @xmath2 regime of interest .",
    "the central approximation for the derivation of this analytical formula of @xmath0 is that the spin hamiltonian @xmath10 commutes with the total magnetization @xmath11 of the cluster . for the majority of magnetic clusters reported in the literature",
    "this approximation is an excellent one for the study of relaxation phenomena at not too low t ( @xmath12 k ) .",
    "indeed , the dominant energy scale in the problem is set by the isotropic heisenberg exchange and very often by a uniaxial onsite anisotropy . there",
    "exist several types of anisotropic interactions which do not conserve @xmath11 , but these are typically very small ( @xmath13 k ) and thus play a significant role only at very low t. thus , although the present work is devoted to the slowing down mechanism in afmr s the method presented here can be applied to the majority of magnetic clusters reported in the literature . in particular",
    ", we will argue that the slowing down mechanism in afmr s must be common in the general class of antiferromagnetic nanomagnets ( which includes e.g. , grids and other clusters ) due to their very similar spectral structure ( cf .",
    "we consider a magnetic ring with an even number @xmath14 of spins @xmath4@xcite described by the hamiltonian _ 0= j_i _ i _",
    "i+1 + g _ b b s_z  , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the first term describes the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath15 ) exchange between nearest - neighbor spins , the second is the zeeman energy in a field @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the total spin , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the bohr magneton .",
    "it is known@xcite that the energy spectrum of @xmath10 is bounded from below by an excitation band @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "[ ] for the validity range of this scaling ) is the lowest singlet - triplet gap . at higher energies there",
    "appear a forest of quasi - continuum excitations which set in progressively above the lowest band .",
    "this dense spectral structure above a certain energy scale is very common in finite unfrustrated antiferromagnets@xcite and , as we show below , affects the relaxational behavior in a very characteristic way .",
    "we are interested in the damping of the equilibrium fluctuations of the total magnetization @xmath11 at not too low @xmath2 and for @xmath22 .",
    "this damping is triggered by the ( phonon - driven ) fluctuating portion of various anisotropies .",
    "here we consider the quadrupolar spin - phonon channel@xcite which we write in the general form [ vsph.eq ] _ = _",
    "i=1^n ( _ i ) ( _ i ) _ i=1^n _ m=-2 ^ 2 q_i m^  _ i m  , where @xmath23 are functions of the local strains or rotation fields , and @xmath24 are the quadrupolar operators @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27",
    ".    it has been found , both experimentally@xcite and numerically@xcite , that the damping of @xmath11 is mono - exponential ( or markovian ) in a large number of nanomagnets .",
    "the physical origin of this central feature has been shown@xcite to arise from a dynamical decoupling of @xmath11 from the remaining slow degrees of freedom which , in turn , follows from the discreteness of the energy spectrum and the conservation law @xmath28=0 $ ] . according to the general expression ( 27 ) of ref .",

    "i m( )  , where @xmath29=m q_{i m}$]@xcite , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the isothermal susceptibility .",
    "thus @xmath0 is proportional to the frequency overlap between the absorption ( -@xmath32 ) coefficient @xmath33 and the emission coefficient @xmath34 of the host lattice@xcite .",
    "as we show below , this formulation is very fruitful since it allows to identify the frequency regime ( or the excitations ) which gives the dominant contribution to @xmath0 in the severe slowing down @xmath2 regime .     for any given absorption frequency @xmath9 of the nanomagnet .",

    ", we find a number of general features which originate in the overall spectral structure of afmr s described above .",
    "we first emphasize the increasingly gapped structure at low @xmath9 and @xmath2 , and the fact that @xmath68 has essentially no weight below the line l@xmath73 .",

    "however , as soon as the one - phonon spectral peak reaches the quasi - continuum regime ( above the line l@xmath73 ) a significant number of spin - phonon resonant channels are quickly thermally activated .",
    "in fact , fig .  [ overlap.fig](b ) shows that @xmath81 samples almost the entire electronic spectral weight up to @xmath88 already at @xmath89 .",
