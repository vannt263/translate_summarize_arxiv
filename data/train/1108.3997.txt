    "the experimental technique of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) has long established itself as a versatile tool for microscopic investigations of matter .",
    "one major source of microscopic information in nmr is the spin - spin relaxation . in solids ,",
    "the description of nmr spin - spin relaxation requires averaging the full hamiltonian of nuclear spin - spin interaction over the fast spin rotations induced by strong external magnetic fields .",
    "the present paper predicts theoretically a set of resonant conditions for solid - state nmr experiments leading to an unconventional form of the averaged interaction hamiltonians .",
    "we consider nuclear spin - spin interactions in the presence of a static magnetic field and a continuously applied _ rotating _",
    "radio - frequency ( rf ) field in the regime , when the two fields have comparable values , while both of them are still much larger than the local fields with which nuclear spins affect each other .",
    "such a setting is realizable experimentally .",
    "however , it implies the use of smaller - than - typical static fields and , therefore , a certain sacrifice in terms of the signal intensity . in a typical nmr experiment",
    ", the rf - field may be large in comparison with the local fields , but it is still much smaller than the static field .",
    "this `` typical '' setting for strong continuously applied rf fields was originally considered by redfield@xcite and subsequently discussed in nmr textbooks@xcite . in such a case , the averaged interaction hamiltonian is obtained from the full hamiltonian with the help of a two - step truncation procedure@xcite .",
    "the first step is to eliminate all interaction terms that do not commute with the zeeman hamiltonian for the static magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the second step is to make the transformation into the rotating reference frame where the rf field appears static , and then further truncate the interaction hamiltonian by eliminating all the terms that do not commute with the zeeman hamiltonian for the effective magnetic field in the rotating frame .",
    "when the static and the rf fields are comparable to each other , the validity of the above two - step truncation becomes questionable , because the spin motions caused by both fields fall on the same timescale .",
    "the full interaction hamiltonian then needs to be averaged over the above two motions simultaneously rather than in two independent steps . in this paper , we show that , in the case of a purely rotating rf field ( as opposed to the case of a linearly - polarized rf field ) , such a single step averaging can be done rigorously without requiring the rf field to be smaller than the static field .",
    "we find that such a single - step procedure generically reproduces the results of redfield s two - step truncation , but the reason for this agreement lies not in the perturbation theory but in the ergodic character of the single - spin dynamics driven by the static and the rf fields .",
    "we also find that in certain special cases , which we call `` recoupling resonances '' , the averaged spin - spin interaction hamiltonian includes other terms in addition to the outcome of redfield s truncation procedure . in the case of single spin species ,",
    "the recoupling resonances appear when the rf field frequency is matched with certain multiples or simple fractions of the larmor frequency corresponding to the effective magnetic field in the rotating reference frame . in the case of two different spin species , the sums and the differences of the two effective larmor frequencies",
    "also appear in some of the recoupling resonance conditions .",
    "the time - averaged interaction hamiltonians associated with the above recoupling resonances are non - secular , in the sense that they do not conserve the total zeeman energy associated with the external fields in either the laboratory or the rotating reference frame .",
    "these hamiltonians may have a range of applications , such as , e.g. , nuclear cross - polarization , or molecular structure determination .",
    "it is worth noting that the term `` recoupling '' is extensively used@xcite in the context of the magic angle spinning ( mas ) technique of nmr , where it implies the recovery of a part of the standard truncated hamiltonian , after that hamiltonian was suppressed by the spinning of the sample .",
    "the mas recoupling schemes match the frequency of the spin nutation@xcite or the frequency of the rf pulses@xcite with the multiples of the sample spinning frequency . in the present paper ,",
    "the term `` recoupling '' is used at a more basic level : it implies the recovery of a part of the _ full _ spin - spin interaction hamiltonian lost in the standard truncation procedure .",
    "the recoupling resonances described below have nothing to do with sample spinning .",
    "however , they are best observable and , probably , most useful in combination with mas .    in a broader context , our results could have been obtained in the framework of the averaged hamiltonian theory@xcite , but to the best of our knowledge it has never been attempted , perhaps because of the non - perturbative character of the problem .",
    "the role of the non - secular terms was , however , discussed in the context of the phenomenon of nuclear spin superradiance@xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give the general formulation of the problem in section  [ general ] , introduce our single - step truncation procedure in section  [ truncation ] , present the results of this truncation with the identification of the recoupling resonances in section  [ results ] , and then discuss a possible experimental test and possible applications of the recoupling resonances in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider a lattice of nuclear spins in a static magnetic field pointing along the @xmath0-axis , @xmath1 , irradiated by a rf field rotating in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane with frequency @xmath4 , .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of the magnetic dipole spin - spin interaction , which is , typically , dominant in solids .",
    "the full hamiltonian @xcite is @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8.\\label{eq : hdip}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 are the coupling constants , @xmath10 are the operators of the nuclear spin of the @xmath11th lattice site , @xmath12 is the gyromagnetic ratio of that spin , @xmath13 are the displacement vectors between two lattice sites @xmath11 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the number of spins .",
    "the characteristic time of a single spin motion induced by the hamiltonian @xmath16 can be estimated as @xmath17 .",
    "the variable @xmath18 is also to be referred to as the transverse relaxation time .",
    "the timescale of nuclear spin relaxation due to the coupling to electrons or phonons is to be denoted as @xmath19 ( longitudinal relaxation time ) .",
    "we further introduce the larmor frequencies @xmath20 and the nutation frequencies @xmath21 . in the following , we drop lattice index @xmath11 in the gyromagnetic ratio and use the notations @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , etc .",
    ", when not dealing with the interactions of non - equivalent ( unlike ) spins explicitly .",
    "this paper is limited to the regime @xmath25 .",
    "the first of these inequalities implies the separation of the timescales between the fast motion due to the external fields and the slow motion due to the spin - spin interaction .",
    "the second inequality allows us to consider the nuclear spins as isolated from the environment .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the theoretical analysis in the literature@xcite was limited so far by the additional inequality @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath27 ) .",
    "our main focus is on the regime @xmath28 .",
    "however , also , for a range of situations satisfying the inequality @xmath26 , the recoupling resonances obtained below will imply important observable effects .",
    "we calculate the effective spin - spin interaction hamiltonian by averaging the full interaction hamiltonian @xmath16 over the fast spin motion induced by the terms @xmath29 . in the heisenberg representation , this fast motion is described by the following equation for each of the spins  : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the above equation is linear in terms of spin operators @xmath32 , and , therefore , its predictions are essentially the same as those for the classical spins , in which case @xmath32 would be simply three numbers . despite the linearity of eq.([eq : spin - eom ] ) , it is not solvable analytically either classically or quantum mechanically for an arbitrary time - dependent @xmath33 .",
    "however , for the specific time dependence considered in this work , the solution is facilitated by the transformation from the laboratory reference frame into the reference frame rotating around the @xmath0-axis with frequency @xmath34 .",
    "the equations of motion in the rotating frame have the same form as eq.([eq : spin - eom ] ) , but with time - independent effective magnetic field @xmath35 .",
    "( the @xmath2-axis in the rotating frame coincides with the direction of the rf field . )",
    "the corresponding larmor frequency is @xmath36 thus , the motion of a spin in the laboratory frame can be characterized as the larmor precession with frequency @xmath37 around the direction of @xmath38 , which itself rotates with frequency @xmath34 around the @xmath0-axis .",
    "our formal procedure for averaging @xmath16 consists of the transformation into the reference frame that follows the fast spin rotation induced by eq.([eq : spin - eom ] ) . in that reference frame",
    ", each spin would be motionless , if the full hamiltonian included only @xmath29 .",
    "such a transformation is time - dependent . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath16 expressed in the new spin coordinates acquires some quickly oscillating interaction coefficients , which we then average out .",
    "the above procedure may , at first sight , appear equivalent to the one introduced by redfield@xcite .",
    "the difference , however , is that redfield did not define the entire transformation and then average the resulting hamiltonian over time but rather used the zeeman - energy - conservation criterion of van vleck@xcite to average separately the hamiltonians obtained at the intermediate steps of this transformation .",
    "such an independent averaging of the intermediate hamiltonians is justifiable by the perturbation theory arguments  @xcite only when @xmath39 .",
    "it is shown below , that in the case of @xmath40 , the spin motions associated with the intermediate transformation steps may be correlated , and thus the averaging over them can not be done independently .",
    "the overall transformation into the reference frame that follows the motion induced by eq.([eq : spin - eom ] ) can be decomposed into three simple transformations visualized in fig.[fig : frames ] .",
    "the first transformation is from the laboratory frame to the reference frame rotating with the rf field : @xmath41 the second transformation is from the rotating to the `` tilted - rotating '' reference frame , where the @xmath0-axis coincides with the direction of @xmath38 : @xmath42 with @xmath43 , \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] admitting values in the range @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "finally , the third transformation is into the `` double - rotating '' reference frame precessing around @xmath45 with frequency @xmath46 : @xmath47 the effective magnetic field in this reference frame is equal to zero . the explicit implementation of transformation ( [ tr2dr ] ) before performing the time - averaging of @xmath16 formally discriminates our treatment from that of redfield@xcite .",

    "the spin coordinates in the laboratory reference frame can now be expressed as @xmath50 the substitution of eq.([eq : iip ] ) into eq .",
    "allows us to reexpress the interaction hamiltonian @xmath16 in terms of @xmath51 and then average the interaction coefficients in the resulting expression .",
    "the full time - dependent form of @xmath16 in the double - rotated reference frame is rather long .",
    "it can be found in ref.@xcite together with the implementation of the time - averaging procedure .",
    "below we exemplify this procedure by one typical term and then , in the next section , present only the resulting time - averaged expressions for @xmath16 .",

    "the question then arises , what happens , if , in an experiment , the actual values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath34 are such that one of the recoupling resonance conditions is satisfied approximately but not exactly . in such a case , the hamiltonian - averaging procedure needs to be modified .",
    "below , we illustrate this modification for the resonant condition @xmath61 but the expression for the resulting correction to the averaged hamiltonian is applicable to all other recoupling resonances .    in the chosen example",
    ", the mismatch of the resonant condition can be parameterized with the help of variable @xmath62 defined by equation @xmath63 .",
    "now we modify the last step of the transformation to the double - rotated reference frame [ eq.([tr2dr ] ) ] by changing the value of the rotation frequency from @xmath37 given by eq.([eq : ome ] ) to @xmath64 . in the modified double - rotated reference frame , the averaged interaction hamiltonian obtained in section  [ like ] for",

    "this is , of course , expected for a significant departure from the recoupling resonance conditions .",
    "when @xmath67 , the above term still suppresses the effect of the non - secular terms but only partially , and this partial suppression is of the same order of magnitude as the suppression caused by the secular interaction terms ( to be explained in section  [ like ] ) . in such a case",
    ", the term ( [ deltah ] ) should simply be included in the averaged hamiltonian together with the secular terms and the resonant non - secular terms .",
    "the above considerations imply , that , in a generic case , when the strength of the secular terms can be estimated as @xmath68 , the recoupling resonance conditions can not be resolved experimentally with accuracy much better than @xmath69 . however , if the secular terms are suppressed by other means , then the experimental resolution will be limited by the strength of the recoupled terms themselves .",
    "thus , if the strength of the recoupled terms is much smaller than @xmath68 , then the recoupling resonances can be resolvable with proportionally better accuracy .",

    "finally , we mention that , as in the case of like spins , the suppression of the secular interaction terms between unlike spins by matching the magic angle condition or by the mas technique is an additional resource for observing the recoupling resonances .",

    "it may , in addition , lead to an anomalous cross - polarization effect .    to be specific , a possible way to observe the anomalous longitudinal relaxation can consist of the following steps : ( i )",
    "polarizing the system in the static magnetic field ; ( ii ) turning on the rf field ( preferably , adiabatically ) to match one of the recoupling resonance conditions ; ( iii ) waiting enough time for the additional interaction terms to relax @xmath91 ( the waiting time should still be much shorter than @xmath19 ) ; and , finally , ( iv ) suddenly turning off the rf field .",
    "no free induction decay signal should be observable in this case .",
    "in contrast , away from the recoupling resonances , a free induction decay signal of finite intensity should always be observable for waiting times of the order of @xmath19 .",

    "( 2 ) as discussed in the context of eq.([deltah ] ) , the recoupling resonances should be matched to an accuracy of roughly @xmath171 .",
    "( 3 ) the static and the rf magnetic fields should be relatively homogeneous ; otherwise the recoupling conditions can not be satisfied over the entire sample .",
    "( 4 ) the strength of the recoupled terms must be such that the timescale associated with the anomalous relaxation of the longitudinal magnetization is faster than @xmath19 ( see the end of section  [ like ] ) .",
    "( 5 ) finally , in the case of @xmath28 , a real circularly polarized rf field should be used , as done , e.g. , in ref.@xcite .",
    "now we discuss the observability of the recoupling resonances in the nmr setting that uses a linearly polarized rf field in the regime of @xmath26 .",
    "the latter condition extends to the experiments in larger static fields , which means stronger nmr signals .",
    "the hamiltonian averaging procedure used in this paper can not be straightforwardly extended to linearly polarized rf fields , because a closed analytical solution for the spin motion is not available in such a case .",
    "in particular , the usual assumption that one can neglect one of the two counter - rotating components contributing to the linearly polarized rf field is not justified when @xmath28 . however , when @xmath26 , the case of linearly polarized rf field should be treatable by combining our truncation procedure with the perturbation expansion@xcite . in this limit",
    ", the presence of two rotating components may lead to additional recoupling resonances , but the resonances obtained in the present paper for a single rotating component of the same frequency should also be present .",
    "we further expect that the same recoupling resonance in the rotating and the linearly polarized settings is generically characterized by the same recoupled hamiltonian , when the leading order of the expansion of this hamiltonian in terms of @xmath96 is linear .    at small values of @xmath96 ,",
    "the recoupling resonances satisfying the above linearity requirement are also the strongest and thus the most promising in terms of experimental observation .",
    "as discussed in section  [ like ] for the case of like spins , the linearity with respect to small @xmath96 is exhibited by some but not all recoupled hamiltonians .",
    "we also note in this context , that an experiment with small linearly polarized fields should avoid the interplay with the secondary single - spin resonances described by winter@xcite . )    in addition to the possibility of using stronger static fields and linearly polarized rf fields , the regime of @xmath26 has two other advantages .",
    "first , the rf field homogeneity requirement is less stringent , when @xmath26 , because what matters is the homogeneity of the effective frequencies @xmath116 , to which the leading rf field contribution is only of the order of @xmath172 .",
    "second , in the case , when the secular part of the interaction is externally suppressed , the smallness of @xmath96 implies that the recoupling resonances can be resolved with higher accuracy ( see the discussion in section  [ truncation ] ) .      _ fundamental studies of spin - spin relaxation : _ perhaps , the most direct use of the tunable hamiltonians ( [ eq : hdip(om = ome)]-[eq : hdip(om=1/2ome ) ] , [ eq : hdu1]-[eq : h2dip(om=1/2(ome1+ome2 ) ) ] ) is to conduct fundamental experimental studies of nuclear spin - spin relaxation in solids , which is still not completely understood , in a much broader range of parameters than those accessible with the standard truncated hamiltonians .    _",
    "cross - polarization : _ in the case of unlike spins , the recoupled hamiltonians ( [ eq : h2dip(om=(ome1+ome2))]-[eq : h2dip(om=1/2(ome1+ome2 ) ) ] ) for the resonances @xmath173 and @xmath174 can be used to cross - polarize different spin species . as mentioned in section  [ unlike ] , these hamiltonians contain `` flip - flop '' terms @xmath175 and @xmath176 , which can transfer polarization from one spin species to the other .",
    "such a transfer would require an rf field rotating with a single frequency , as opposed to the standard hartmann - hahn cross polarization routine @xcite , which involves two rf - field frequencies .",
    "the two spin species can also be cross - polarized , albeit less efficiently , using the transient effect of the `` double - flip '' terms @xmath177 and @xmath178 for resonances @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the suppression of the secular terms by either the magic angle condition or the mas technique , as discussed in section  [ unlike ] , can enhance the efficiency of both the flip - flop - based and the double - flip - based cross - polarization processes . in the latter case",
    "this enhancement should be particularly significant .",
    "_ structure determination : _ the use of solid - state nmr for determining the structures of complex molecules involves mas decoupling between nuclear spins followed by selective recoupling@xcite .",
    "the recoupling resonances obtained in this paper can , possibly , be used at the latter stage . as discussed in section  [ experiment ] , the regime @xmath26 may provide both the sufficient intensity and the sufficient frequency resolution for such experiments . if successful , such a method will not require the recoupling sequence to be adjusted to the sample spinning frequency .",
    "it will also have an added benefit of the non - trivial spatial dependence in the recoupled hamiltonians as compared to the usual secular interactions .",
    "this dependence can be converted into additional structure information for oriented samples .    in summary ,",
    "the recoupling resonances for like and unlike spins amount to a new resource for manipulating nuclear spins , and , therefore , are likely to be useful for various nmr applications .",
    "however , the condition of applying a high amplitude rf field for a rather long time may be challenging to realize in practice .",
    "in this paper , we described theoretically the properties of recoupling resonances associated with the appearance of non - secular terms in the time - averaged hamiltonians of nuclear spins - spin interaction in solids in the presence of strong rotating rf fields .",
    "our analysis indicates that , under certain conditions , the effect of the recoupled non - secular interaction terms should be particularly well observable .",
