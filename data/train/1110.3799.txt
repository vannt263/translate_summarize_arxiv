    "all of the previously known dusty white dwarfs show metal - absorption features in their optical spectra ( daz or dbz spectral type ) , and they were specifically targeted ( except g29 - 38 ) for infrared searches because they are metal - rich .",
    "the best way to identify new dusty white dwarfs would be to observe more daz / dbz white dwarfs in the infrared .",
    "however , the classification of a da as a metal - rich star requires the detection of weak metal lines with equivalent widths of @xmath5 50 ma . this can only be achieved with high resolution spectroscopy at 10 m class telescopes @xcite . a cheaper way to find",
    "more dusty white dwarfs is to perform a near - infrared search around a large sample of white dwarfs without prior knowledge of metal absorption features in the targeted stars . with high - quality optical and near - infrared photometry",
    ", a warm debris disk signature can be recognized in the @xmath0-band @xcite .",
    "for example , a @xmath0-band only search would detect the disks around 70% of the known dusty white dwarfs .    to identify new dusty white dwarfs and to constrain the frequency of dusty white dwarfs among the da population ,",

    "@xcite performed a detailed model atmosphere analysis of the da white dwarfs in the pg survey using optical spectroscopy and provide temperature , surface gravity , mass , and age estimates .",
    "their spectroscopy does not have enough resolution to detect the metal - rich dazs .",
    "we select @xmath7100 apparently single white dwarfs with @xmath8 9000 - 22,000 k , where we are most efficient in finding the disks using near - infrared data .    here",

    "pg1541 is a 510 myr old zz ceti variable white dwarf with @xmath9 k , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 pc @xcite . it was originally an a type star with an initial mass of 3 @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "we obtained simultaneous @xmath20 imaging of pg1541 using the pairitel on ut 2010 february 15 .",
    "pairitel is the old 2mass telescope and it uses the same camera and the filter set as 2mass .",

    "the dotted line shows the telluric spectrum obtained from the reference a0v star observations . the telluric correction for pg1541 is not perfect in the regions around 1.4 and 1.9 @xmath24 m .",
    "the irtf spectrum matches the observed photometry in the 0.7 - 2.5@xmath24 m region relatively well and it confirms the slight @xmath18-band excess and more significant @xmath19-band excess in the pairitel photometry .",
    "the shape of the infrared excess is similar to the excess seen in the other dusty white dwarfs ; there are no obvious emission or absorption features , and it is rising toward longer wavelengths .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectral energy distribution of pg1541 in the 0.1 - 5@xmath24 m range , including the galex , sdss , pairitel , and _",
    "pg1541 is relatively nearby and the line of sight reddening is only @xmath29 @xcite ; its spectral energy distribution does not show any evidence of reddening .",
    "pg1541 is brighter at 4.5@xmath24 m than it is at 2@xmath24 m .",
    "since the stellar contribution falls like a power law in this wavelength range , the contribution from the cool component is still rising at 5@xmath24 m .",
    "this contribution is almost identical to the excess flux seen around g29 - 38 in the same wavelength region ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "a brown dwarf companion can not explain the observed photometry in the 2 - 5 @xmath24 m range @xcite .",
    "in addition , spectral features from such a companion would be visible in our irtf spectrum .",
    "hence , the infrared excess around pg1541 can only be explained by a circumstellar disk .",
    "we fit the infrared excess around pg1514 using the optically thick flat - disk models of @xcite . using the effective temperature , radius , and distance estimates for the white dwarf",
    ", we created a grid of disk models with inner temperatures 1000 - 1800 k , outer temperatures 300 - 1300 k ( in steps of 100 k and with the condition that @xmath30 ) and inclination angles @xmath31 ( in steps of 10@xmath32 ) .",
    "the model that best fits the infrared photometry has @xmath33 = 1300 k , @xmath34 = 600 k , and an inclination angle of @xmath35 . to estimate the uncertainties for these parameters , we perfom a monte carlo analysis where we replace the observed photometry @xmath36 with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the error in flux and @xmath39 is a gaussian deviate with zero mean and unit variance . for each of the 10,000 sets of modified photometry",
    ", we repeat our analysis and derive new best - fit parameters for the disk . we adopt the interquartile range as the uncertainty .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath40 k , @xmath41 k , and @xmath42 degrees .",
    "the disk is within 0.13 - 0.36  of the white dwarf ; this is within the roche radius for tidal disruption of an asteroid @xcite .",
    "these parameters are similar to the parameters for the other dusty white dwarfs studied with the same flat - disk model , including g29 - 38 @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the disk can not be constrained for an opaque ring . based on the choice of optically thin or thick models",
    ", the disk around g29 - 38 holds @xmath43 g of material @xcite .",
    "a similar amount of material may exist in the disk around pg1541 .",
    "along with gd 133 , wd 1150@xmath44153 , and g29 - 38 , pg1541 is the fourth dav known to host a circumstellar debris disk .",
    "every da is expected to go through the zz ceti instability strip during its evolution ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we expect that some of the dazs with disks will also be davs ; there is nothing special about finding 4 dusty dav white dwarfs",
    ". however , optical and infrared observations of the pulsations in the first known dusty white dwarf , g29 - 38 , were important for identifying the source of the infrared excess as a debris disk rather than a brown dwarf companion @xcite .    the main pulsation mode in pg1541 has an amplitude of 4.5% in the optical with a period of 689 s @xcite .",
    "@xcite detect 4% fluctuations in g29 - 38 at 3.6@xmath24 m , whereas the main pulsation mode in the optical has an amplitude larger than 20% @xcite .",
    "the infrared variations are likely due to the dust grains going through temperature fluctuations with the stellar pulsations . assuming that the disk around pg1541 is similar to g29 - 38 s disk",
    ", we do not expect to see any significant ( @xmath41% ) variations in our irac data for pg1541 .",
    "hence our disk model is not likely to be effected by stellar variability .",
    "previous _ spitzer _ surveys find a frequency of 1 - 3% for dusty white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "out of the 348 das analyzed by @xcite , there are now six pg white dwarfs known to host debris disks : pg 0843 + 517 , 1015 + 161 , 1116 + 026 , 1457@xmath44086 , 1541 + 651 , and 2326 + 049 ( g29 - 38 ) .",
    "therefore , the frequency of debris disks in the pg sample is at least 1.7% .",
    "however , not all of the da white dwarfs in the pg survey have been observed in the infrared , and a more accurate analysis will have to wait until our entire sample is presented in an upcoming publication .    the ongoing wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mission should greatly increase the sample of known dusty white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the wise infrared excesses around degenerates ( wired ) survey has already identified a new dusty white dwarf at 55 pc , galex1931 @xcite , and it is predicted to detect disks around g29 - 38-like objects within @xmath5100 pc of the sun @xcite . however , due to its relatively large beam size ( @xmath45 ) , background contamination may be a problem for wise observations of targets in crowded fields @xcite .",
    "pg1541 is bright enough to be detected in the wise 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath24 m bands , and possibly in longer wavelength data if it displays a silicate emission feature .",
    "we have detected an infrared excess at 2 - 5 @xmath24 m around the 510 myr old ( cooling age ) pulsating white dwarf pg 1541 + 651 and determined it to be a narrow dust ring within the tidal disruption radius of the white dwarf .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopic data show a significant contribution from a featureless spectrum rising to the red , confirming our dust disk interpretation .",
    "pg1541 is most likely a daz , however high - resolution optical spectroscopy is required to identify weak metal absorption features .",
    "we detected the disk around pg1541 in our survey of @xmath7100 da white dwarfs from the pg survey .",
    "our remaining targets will be presented in a future publication , which will also address the frequency of disks in the pg survey .",
