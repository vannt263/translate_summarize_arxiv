    "topology is a ubiquitous concept in physics , ranging from electrons in solid state  @xcite , quantum degenerate gases  @xcite , and sound  @xcite .",
    "a key manifestation of topological physics is the presence of edge modes which are robust to local disorder .",
    "the prospect of using topological photonic materials for such robust propagation of light has attracted a great deal of interest  @xcite .",
    "topologically - protected edge states have been experimentally demonstrated in systems at microwave freqencies  @xcite and optical frequencies , specifically in ring resonators  @xcite , and in coupled waveguides  @xcite .",
    "subsequent work measured the invariants characterizing the topology of two - dimensional photonic systems  @xcite .",
    "embedding quantum emitters into these optical frequency devices could generate strong optical non - linearities that exhibit new physical behavior .",
    "theoretical work has shown that the interplay between emitters and chiral states results in intriguing phenomena such as many - body position - independent scattering  @xcite , dimerization of driven emitters  @xcite and fractional quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "strong light - matter interactions with optical emitters usually require the concentration of light to small mode - volume nanophotonic devices  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional photonic crystals are one of the most promising nanophotonic platforms for this application because they confine light to less than an optical wavelength  @xcite .",
    "recently , several works have proposed photonic crystal structures where deformations open a gap in the dirac cone dispersion to achieve non - trivial topological bands  @xcite . however , these proposals either make use of dielectric cylinders , which make it difficult to experimentally achieve out - of - plane confinement in planar all - dielectric nanophotonic systems , or make use of metallic mirrors to achieve out - of - plane confinement , which is undesirable for devices operating at optical frequencies where loss in metals is significant .",
    "thus , it would be highly desirable to create an all - dielectric topological photonic crystal which is confined in the out - of - plane direction without the use of metal .",

    "we first analyze the band structure of this photonic crystal in the two - hole unit cell picture using three - dimensional numerical finite - difference time - domain calculations ( lumerical fdtd solutions ) .",
    "we perform simulations using gaas as the dielectric substrate , with index of refraction taken from ref .",

    "the field is confined within the dielectric slab due to total internal reflection at the air - dielectric boundary .",
    "this proves that one can realize topological edge states in three dimensions within dielectric materials at optical frequencies without significant out - of - plane loss .",
    "one of the most distinguishing features of topological edge states is their robustness against perturbations .",
    "to test this robustness , we introduced four @xmath26 bends to the structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d](e ) .",
    "excitation of the edge mode in this configuration shows that there is very little backscattering along the entire path .",
    "thus our edge states exhibit topological protection against certain disorder and defects , in contrast to chiral , but topologically - trivial , waveguide modes  @xcite .",
    "we note that the topological protection we obtain in the presence of time - reversal symmetry differs in an important respect from that of electronic quantum spin hall systems .",
    "the general classification of topological insulators reveals that the @xmath27 topological invariant describing the latter requires that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the time - reversal symmetry operator .",
    "the minus sign is a particular feature of fermionic systems .",
    "in contrast , maxwell s equations ( and other bosonic systems ) obey @xmath30 .",
    "this symmetry taken alone does not afford any topological protection in two dimensions .",
    "however , we can construct a ` pseudo ' time - reversal symmetry operator based on the ( @xmath31 ) crystal symmetry of the lattice which obeys @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "while this assures that the bulk may be classified according to a @xmath27 topological invariant , gapless edge modes are not guaranteed since this symmetry is broken at the boundaries .",
    "this symmetry breaking can mix the counter - propagating edge states and open a mini - gap in the edge mode  @xcite ; in a quantum spin hall system , this would be akin to a magnetic impurity at the edge of the system . apparently , in our realization this symmetry breaking is weak since we do not observe a gap in the edge states [ fig  [ fig : edge](b ) ] .",
    "we can decouple the pseudo - spin degrees of freedom up to linear order in @xmath32 near the @xmath3 point . by considering these degrees of freedom as being completely decoupled",
    ", we can characterize the topology of the system by a stronger @xmath33 spin chern number given by the difference of the chern numbers for each pseudo - spin  @xcite .    to conclude",
    ", we have proposed a new all - dielectric photonic crystal design and presented simulation results showing that three - dimensionally guided topological edge states at optical frequencies can be realized .",
    "our design parameters are amenable to implementation with well - established nanofabrication techniques .",
    "our simulations focus on gaas as the dielectric substrate but the photonic crystal design principles that give rise to topological edge states are applicable to many other dielectric materials such as indium phosphide , silicon , and diamond . with the future prospect of integration with various quantum emitters ranging from quantum dots  @xcite , defects in two - dimensional materials  @xcite and diamond  @xcite",
