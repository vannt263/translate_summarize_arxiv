    "neutrino - nucleus reactions play essential roles in many astrophysical applications . these include core - collapse supernovae @xcite , explosive @xcite and r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite , and observation of solar and supernova neutrinos by terrestrial detectors @xcite .    stars with masses @xmath0 end their lives as core - collapse supernovae . in the final stages of their evolution these stars produce an inner core consisting of electrons and ` iron nuclei ' ( nuclei with mass numbers @xmath1 ) . as these nuclei have the highest binding energy per nucleon , additional fusion reactions cost , rather than generate , energy .",
    "the stellar core has lost its energy source , and once the core mass has grown larger than the chandrasekhar mass limit the star starts to collapse under its own gravity .",
    "the simulation of the final evolution and collapse of such massive stars is one of the outstanding current challenges in astrophysics , combining state - of - the - art microphysics input ( nuclear and neutrino physics ) with sophisticated treatments of hydrodynamics and radiation transport . despite significant progress in both of these aspects",
    ", current core - collapse supernova simulations often fail to yield explosions @xcite .",
    "since most of the explosion energy is carried by neutrinos , an essential part of these simulations is a detailed treatment of neutrino transport including the various interactions of neutrinos with the supernova environment .",
    "one of these interaction processes is inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering , which is currently ignored in supernova simulations .",
    "recent work indicates that this might be unjustified .",
    "it has been shown that finite temperature effects increase the low - energy neutrino - nucleus cross sections significantly @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent improvements in calculating electron capture on heavy nuclei during the collapse phase implies that these captures dominate the capture on free protons @xcite , in contrast to previous beliefs @xcite .",
    "captures on nuclei produce neutrinos with smaller energies , making temperature effects more important , and the inclusion of inelastic neutrino - nucleus reactions in supernova simulations more relevant .",
    "a call for reliable neutrino - nucleus cross sections has also been made in the context of explosive nucleosynthesis , occurring when the shock wave passes through the exploding star which leads to fast nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "the pioneering study of neutrino - nucleus reactions during core collapse has been performed by bruenn and haxton @xcite .",
    "these authors calculated inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering rates ( neutral current ) and neutrino - nucleus absorption rates ( charged current ) approximating the nuclear composition present in the stellar core by a single nucleus , @xmath2fe .",
    "the calculated rates were based on a nuclear model appropriate for temperatures @xmath3 , combining a truncated nuclear shell model evaluation of the allowed contributions to the cross sections with estimates for forbidden components within the framework of the goldhaber - teller model @xcite . in detailed supernova simulations bruenn and haxton studied 3 phases of the collapse and explosion in which neutrino - nucleus reaction could be potentially important : the matter infall , the prompt shock propagation phase , and the delayed - shock phase .",
    "first , they found that inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering plays the ` same extremely important role of equilibrating @xmath4 s to matter during infall as neutrino - electron scattering ' @xcite .",
    "second , they did not confirm an earlier suggestion by haxton @xcite who pointed to the possibility that neutrino - nucleus reactions can preheat the matter ahead of the shock during the early phase of the explosion .",
    "third , their simulation indicated no significant contribution of neutrino - nucleus reactions to the revival of the stalled shock , compared to neutrino absorption on free nucleons .",
    "sampaio _ et al _ have argued that the finite temperature environment of a supernova alters inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering cross sections noticeably @xcite .",
    "using a shell - model treatment of the dominant gamow - teller ( gt ) component they showed that finite - temperature effects increase the cross sections for inelastic neutrino scattering on even - even nuclei , like @xmath2fe , at low energies ( @xmath5 mev ) significantly . on the other hand , their study of @xmath6co and 59fe suggested that the effect is less pronounced for odd-@xmath7 and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "this variation in the importance indicates that inelastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections for application in supernova simulations should be derived i ) at finite temperatures and ii ) for an appropriate matter composition .",
    "the aim of the present work is to prepare data on an ensemble of nuclei relevant for supernova simulations .",
    "calculations have been performed for 40 isotopes of mn , fe , co , and ni , covering in each isotope chain the range from @xmath8 to very neutron - rich nuclei . to estimate the possible effect of inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering within a supernova , we use the calculated cross sections to speculate about the matter heating rate in the post - bounce supernova .    in a supernova",
    ", inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering occurs at rather modest neutrino energies , @xmath9 mev .",
    "this makes the cross sections sensitive to nuclear structure effects , particularly for neutrinos with energies lower than 20 mev",
    ". therefore nuclear models must be employed , which can describe the many - body correlations in the nucleus accurately .",
    "the model of choice is the shell model , which now allows for virtually converged calculations of the gamow - teller response for nuclei in the iron mass range @xcite , with a quite satisfactory reproduction of the available experimental gamow - teller data @xcite .",
    "while the gt component determines the neutrino - nucleus cross section at low neutrino energies , higher multipole contributions become increasingly important at higher neutrino energies .",
    "we have calculated these contributions within the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect - models ]",
    "we briefly describe the formalism used to evaluate inelastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections at finite temperature .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sect - results ] . for each nucleus , the cross sections are shown for several representative supernova temperatures . since the important quantity for supernova simulations is the energy transfer from neutrinos to the core matter , we present cross sections as a function of initial and final neutrino energies for representative nuclei .",
    "we finish the paper with a summary and conclusions in section [ sect - summary ] .",
    "there we also make some remarks on the impact of our results on the matter heating rate in supernova simulations .",
    "in neutrino - induced reactions the nucleus is excited by multipole operators @xmath10 which scale like @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the nuclear radius ( @xmath13 fm ) . as the momentum transfer @xmath14 is of the order of the neutrino energy @xmath15 , neutrino - nucleus reactions involve multipole operators with successively higher rank @xmath16 as the neutrino energy increases @xcite .",
    "inelastic scattering of low - energy neutrinos off nuclei is dominated by allowed ( @xmath17 ) gamow - teller transitions .",
    "the gt response is in turn sensitive to nuclear structure effects and hence its contribution to the cross section has to be derived from a model which is capable to describe both the relevant nuclear structure and the correlation effects .",
    "this model is the diagonalization shell model @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature in a supernova environment implies that the scattering occurs on a thermal nuclear ensemble rather than the ground state .",
    "however , the relevant supernova temperatures ( @xmath18 mev ) ensure that mainly states at modest nuclear excitation energies , which are also reasonably well described within large - scale shell model approaches , are present in the thermal ensemble . as we will show below",
    ", finite - temperature effects are only relevant for low neutrino energies @xmath19 mev ) .",
    "thus we expect that gt transitions will also dominate the neutrino scattering cross section on the thermally excited nuclear states at these neutrino energies .",
    "higher multipoles contribute to the cross section for larger neutrino energies .",
    "for each of these multipoles the response of the operator will be fragmented over many nuclear states .",
    "however , most of the strength resides in a collective excitation , the giant resonance , whose centroid energy grows with increasing rank @xmath16 roughly like @xmath20 mev .",
    "as the phase space prefers larger final neutrino energies , the average nuclear excitation energy grows noticeably slower than the initial neutrino energy . as a consequence , initial neutrino energies are noticeably larger than the energy of a giant resonance , when the latter will contribute to the neutrino - nucleus cross section .",
    "fortunately , the neutrino - nucleus cross section depends then mainly on the total strength of the multipole excitation and its centroid energy , and not on the detailed energy distribution of the strength ( as it is for the gamow - teller response at low neutrino energies ) .",
    "we will derive the higher multipole contributions to the neutrino - nucleus cross section within the rpa , making use of the fact that the rpa describes the energy centroid and the total strength of multipoles other than the gamow - teller quite well .",
    "kolbe _ et al _ @xcite proposed this hybrid model , in which contributions of the allowed transitions @xmath21 ) to the neutrino - nucleus cross section are derived within the shell model , and the other multipole responses ( @xmath22 ) are calculated within the rpa .",
    "it has been shown that the model reproduces the experimental @xmath23 cross section on @xmath2fe , induced by neutrinos with a michel energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "et al _ applied this model to various neutrino - induced reactions on iron isotopes at the temperature @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering data for nuclei exists , except for the transition from the ground state to the isospin @xmath24 state at @xmath25 mev in @xmath26c @xcite .",
    "however , it was recently shown that high - precision data on the magnetic dipole strength distribution , obtained from inelastic electron scattering on spherical nuclei , like 50ti , 52cr and 54fe , give the required information about the gamow - teller strength distribution for these nuclei and thus strongly constrain inelastic low - energy neutrino - nucleus cross sections @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization shell model reproduces the electron scattering data very well , validating this model for calculation of low - energy inelastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections .",
    "alternatively , the relevant @xmath27 strength could be obtained through a complete isospin decomposition of the @xmath28 strength measured in @xmath29-type reactions , see  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless a direct measurement of neutrino - nucleus cross sections for selected nuclei relevant for supernova simulations is desirable .",
    "such measurements could be performed with a dedicated detector at a neutron spallation source @xcite .    in the hybrid model ,",
    "the total reaction cross section consists then of two parts @xmath30 where the shell model part , @xmath31 , describes the gamow - teller contributions to the cross section , while the contributions from all other multipoles are comprised in the rpa part , @xmath32 .",
    "the total cross section ( denoted as ` cross section ' in the following ) is a function of the initial neutrino energy .",
    "we also calculate cross sections as a function of initial and final neutrino energies ( called ` differential cross sections ' below ) , obtained by gating @xmath33 on a range of outgoing neutrino energies @xmath34 for a given energy of the incoming neutrino , @xmath15 . in principle",
    ", supernova simulations require the inelastic neutrino cross sections also as a function of angle of the final neutrino .",
    "the hybrid model allows the calculation of such differential cross sections .",
    "however , we have omitted this degree of freedom here , since supernova simulations can already judge the importance of inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering on the basis of the differential cross sections and assuming an isotropic angular distribution .    as discussed above",
    ", finite - temperature effects will modify the gamow - teller contribution to the cross section .",
    "however , an explicit calculation of the cross section by shell model diagonalization at finite temperature ( @xmath35 mev ) includes too many states to derive the @xmath36 strength distribution for each individual state and is hence unfeasible .",
    "we , therefore , use the same strategy as in @xcite .",
    "we split the shell model cross section into parts describing i ) neutrino down - scattering ( @xmath37 ) and ii ) up - scattering ( @xmath38 ) ; here @xmath39 @xmath15 are neutrino energies in the final and initial states , respectively . for the down - scattering part",
    "we apply brink s hypothesis which states that for a given excited nuclear level @xmath40 the @xmath36 distribution built on this state , @xmath41 , is the same as for the ground state , @xmath42 , but shifted by the excitation energy @xmath43 : @xmath44 .",
    "brink s hypothesis was proved valid if many states contribute to the thermal nuclear ensemble @xcite . upon applying brink s hypothesis ,",
    "the down - scattering part becomes independent of temperature and can be solely derived from the ground state @xmath36 distribution . with this approximation , the gamow - teller ( shell model )",
    "contribution to the cross section becomes : @xmath45 , \\label{eq - sm - cross - section}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the fermi constant , and @xmath47 is the energy of the scattered neutrino , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 @xmath50 denoting the initial and final nuclear energies .",
    "the @xmath36 reduced transition probability between the initial and final nuclear states are given by @xmath51 where the matrix element is reduced with respect to the spin operator @xmath52 only and the sum runs over all nucleons ; @xmath53 is the zero - component of the isospin operator in a spherical representation .",
    "as required in @xmath54 shell model calculations , the @xmath36 matrix elements have to be scaled by a constant quenching factor .",
    "we use @xcite @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xcite .    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - sm - cross - section ] ) arises from brink s hypothesis . by construction",
    ", this term does not allow neutrino up - scattering .",
    "these contributions to the cross section are comprised in the second term , where the sum runs over both initial ( @xmath40 ) and final states ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the former have a thermal weight of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the angular momentum , @xmath43 is the energy of the initial state , and @xmath60 is the temperature in mev ; @xmath61 is the nuclear partition function .",
    "the up - scattering contributions are the more important i ) the lower the nuclear excitation energy ( the boltzmann weight in the thermal ensemble regulates the population of the states ) , ii ) the larger the @xmath36 transition strength @xmath62 , and iii ) the larger the final neutrino energy , @xmath63 . guided by these general considerations we approximate the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - sm - cross - section ] ) by explicitly considering gt transitions between nuclear states with @xmath64 , where the sum over the final nuclear states is restricted to the lowest ( four to nine ) nuclear levels .",
    "the respective @xmath36 matrix elements are determined by an inversion of the shell model @xmath36 distributions of these low - lying states , employing a lanczos diagonalization technique with 35 - 60 iterations per final angular momentum and isospin .",
    "although the lanczos states at moderate energies @xmath65 mev represent the energy distribution of the strength , rather than converged nuclear states , the chosen ensemble of final nuclear states appears sufficient to approximate the nuclear partition function at the temperatures studied here .",
    "the lowest shell model energies were replaced by experimental data @xcite , whenever available .",
    "the contributions of higher multipoles with rank @xmath22 to the cross section , @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - sigma - tot ] ) , were calculated using a generalized version of the rpa , which allows for partial occupancies of the single - particle orbits in the parent ground state .",
    "we have taken the proton and neutron occupation numbers from the independent particle model , which has been shown to yield quite similar cross sections for multipoles with @xmath22 as an approach where the shell model occupation numbers were used @xcite .",
    "the rpa energies were derived from an appropriate woods - saxon potential , adjusted to reproduce the experimental values of the proton and neutron separation energies . as the residual interaction in the rpa calculation we adopted a zero - range migdal force . the rpa formalism and its application to neutrino - nucleus reactions",

    "a previous study of neutral current neutrino - nucleus reaction cross - sections @xcite suggested that finite - temperature effects are only relevant at low neutrino energies , @xmath5 mev .",

    "the nuclei 53mn ( see fig .  [ fig - mn - xsect ] ) and 55co ( fig.[fig - co - xsect ] ) are good examples of odd - even nuclei , where thermal effects are as important as in the even - even nucleus 56fe ( fig .",

    "thermal effects are more important and , obviously , they are more likely to up - scatter low - energy neutrinos than those where the threshold is virtually absent .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio ] , and we also demonstrate this behavior for the nuclei @xmath130fe and @xmath131co in figs.[fig - fe52-enuenu ] and [ fig - co59-enuenu ] . for each nucleus",
    "we present the normalized - to - unity neutrino spectra at three different temperatures ( @xmath95 , 1.29 , and 1.72 mev ) and , for each temperature , for three different initial neutrino energies are shown : @xmath132 , 10 , and 15 mev .    as the spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig - fe52-enuenu ] and [ fig - co59-enuenu ] are normalized , the increase in absolute magnitude with temperature is not reflected , but can be read off figs.[fig - mn - xsect]-[fig - ni - xsect ] .",
    "we remind here that in our formulation of the total cross section , only the up - scattering processes ( @xmath133 ) are temperature - dependent .",
    "the absolute value of the neutrino up - scattering cross section increases with temperature since a larger fraction of nuclear excited states with increasing phase space can be populated . consequently , the relative contribution of up - scattered neutrinos in the spectra increases with temperature and , for a given @xmath15 , the spectra of up - scattered neutrinos are getting wider as temperature increases .",
    "the missing low - energy strength in the ground state @xmath27 distributions for the even - even isotopes @xmath134fe ( fig .  [ fig - fe - gt0 ] ) implies that these nuclei have only a very few states which can be excited by a @xmath132 mev neutrino .",
    "therefore the neutrino distributions for these nuclei ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fe52-enuenu ] ) are dominated by up - scattered neutrinos even for temperatures as low as @xmath95 mev .",
    "the up - scattering process dominates also in 56fe at @xmath102 and 1.72 mev , but it is about equally significant as down - scattering at @xmath95 mev . as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio ] , a fraction of the @xmath135 mev neutrinos is up - scattered by even - even iron isotopes . for @xmath129 mev neutrinos ,",
    "temperature effects are unimportant and nearly all neutrinos are down - scattered . as temperature effects are in general less important for odd-@xmath7 nuclei , inelastic neutrino scattering on the odd isotopes @xmath136fe up - scatter a much smaller fraction of neutrinos , even at @xmath132 mev , than scattering on even iron isotopes .",
    "similarly , up - scattering is also relatively unimportant for odd - odd nuclei .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.[fig - co59-enuenu ] , where we show the normalized neutrino spectra for the odd-@xmath137 isotopes @xmath131co .",
    "although present for @xmath132 mev neutrinos , neutrino up - scattering is significantly less pronounced than for the even - even iron isotopes .",
    "when comparing the current neutrino spectrum for 59co with fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can observe that there is no big @xmath138 contribution , which is related to the omission of the elastic contribution to the cross section here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - fe56-partxsect ] we show the ( unnormalized ) partial cross sections for inelastic neutrino scattering off @xmath2fe , choosing @xmath139 mev as a representative supernova temperature .",
    "the partial cross sections cover the range of initial neutrino energies between @xmath140 mev and 38 mev in 4 mev steps .",
    "note that for a clearer presentation , some of the cross sections are scaled ( i.e.  the actual values are obtained by multiplying the shown cross sections by the indicated factors , which , for example , is @xmath141 for @xmath140 mev ) . at all shown initial neutrino energies the cross sections are dominated by the @xmath27 contributions . as a consequence",
    ", the largest partial cross sections are found for @xmath142 for @xmath143 mev , corresponding to the centroid of the @xmath27 distribution . for higher neutrino energies we observe the appearance of structures in the partial cross sections at final neutrino energies smaller than corresponding to the @xmath27 centroid .",
    "these peaks are related to excitations of the giant resonances in forbidden multipole transitions , which , as expected , become more prominent with increasing initial neutrino energies . to make this relation more visible",
    ", the figure shows the individual contributions of the allowed and forbidden multipole transitions to the partial cross sections .",
    "we performed studies of neutral - current neutrino - nucleus reactions for four isotope chains : mn , fe , co , and ni .",
    "these studies are relevant for supernova simulations and hence have to take the finite temperature of the supernova environment into account . in our approach , we determine the allowed contributions to the cross sections from large - scale diagonalization shell model evaluations of the gamow - teller @xmath27 response .",
    "contributions to the cross sections , arising from other multipoles , were calculated within the random - phase approximation . we have calculated the @xmath27 distributions for many nuclei for the first time .",
    "our results indicate a systematic trend in these distributions as they are usually dominated by a collective excitation whose centroid is located at excitation energies around 10 mev in the nuclei studied here .",
    "finite temperature effects on the cross sections are only relevant at rather small neutrino energies and were approximated in our approach by considering @xmath27 transitions from thermally populated states to the ground state and excited states at low nuclear excitation energies .",
    "we confirm the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite that finite temperature effects enhances the inelastic scattering cross - sections for low energy neutrinos .",
    "we also find that temperature effects become negligible once the energy of the initial neutrino is large enough to allow for transitions to the centroid of the @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , due to nuclear structure effects the temperature dependence is in general largest for even - even nuclei , and among the nuclei studied here , also for the two odd-@xmath7 nuclei with closed @xmath110 neutron shells ( @xmath111mn and @xmath112co ) .",
    "one goal of our study was to produce inelastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections suitable for use in supernova simulations .",
    "however , in the unshocked regions of supernova where this process is relevant , many nuclei are present in the matter composition with sizable abundance .",
    "supernova simulations which contain detailed neutrino transport , however , represent this matter composition by protons , neutrons , @xmath144 particles and ` average nuclei ' which simulate all heavier nuclei , see e.g.  @xcite . for use in supernova simulations ,",
    "the neutrino cross sections for the individual nuclei have to be averaged over the supernova matter composition , as it is , for example , done for stellar electron capture @xcite . to simplify this procedure",
    "it has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the neutrino - nucleus cross sections from an ` average nucleus ' which is chosen to approximate the matter composition .",
    "such a prescription is justified by our calculations for larger neutrino energies , say at @xmath145 mev , where the cross sections for the various nuclei are rather similar .",
    "however , the prescription appears to be less justified at low neutrino energies where the cross sections for different nuclei show strong variations . for these neutrino energies it is preferable to calculate the total neutrino - nucleus cross section as a compositionally weighted average over the individual cross sections .",
    "this procedure is facilitated as the supernova matter composition is given by nuclear statistical equilibrium under most conditions where the cross sections are needed .",
    "inclusion of these rates in a supernova simulation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , to get an idea of the importance of this process we estimated the heating rate in the post - bounce region using results from a previous simulation @xcite . following bruenn and haxton @xcite ,",
    "we approximated the reaction cross sections on all nuclei in the iron - shell by one nucleus . to check the variations in the produced rates we took four different cases : 55co , 56co , 55fe , and 56fe .",
    "the obtained heating rates were different by 40 - 50% , supporting the idea that the neutrino - nucleus heating rate in supernova is moderately sensitive to the detailed composition of the region .",
    "the astrophysical implications of these improved neutral - current neutrino - nucleus reaction rates are currently under investigation .",
    "prior investigations by bruenn and haxton @xcite found that the energy transfer due to neutrino - nucleus scattering was comparable to ( but smaller than ) that from neutrino - electron scattering during the infall phase . at later times in the simulation , bruenn and haxton found that while neutrino - nucleus scattering dominated in the cooler iron - rich regions , @xmath146 capture on protons and neutrino scattering on @xmath147he were more important closer to the shock . given the similarity of our cross sections to those used by bruenn and haxton for the neutrino energy range of relevance for post - shock heating ( @xmath122 mev ) , we expect their conclusions to stand .",
    "however , in addition to the microscopic rates for the interactions themselves , these conclusions also depend strongly on the composition which depends on the hydrodynamic state and neutronization , since the matter in question is in nuclear statistical equilibrium . therefore these conclusions must be revisited in light of recent improvements in supernova models .",
    "of particular interest in this regard is the impact of revisions in the treatment of nuclear electron capture @xcite which have recently been shown to alter the thermodynamics and neutronization throughout the collapsing stellar core @xcite .",
    "improved cross - sections for @xmath148he ( see , however , @xcite ) , as well as intermediate mass nuclei , would be desirable , since these nuclei experience the intense neutrino flux in the supernova as well .",
