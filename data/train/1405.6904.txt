    "each noncrossing arc diagram determines some combinatorial data , namely which pairs of points are joined by an arc and which points are left and right of each arc .",

    "there is one noncrossing arc diagram ( with no arcs ) , and for @xmath7 there are two noncrossing arc diagrams ( with one arc or no arcs ) . figures  [ diagrams3 ] and  [ diagrams4 ] show the @xmath8 noncrossing arc diagrams on @xmath9 points and the @xmath10 noncrossing arc diagrams on @xmath11 points .",
    "say two arcs are * _ compatible _ * if there exists a noncrossing arc diagram containing those two arcs .",
    "compatibility is a combinatorial condition , depending only on the endpoints of the two curves and on which points are left and right of each curve : given arcs @xmath12 and @xmath13 , suppose there is a point @xmath4 that is left of ( or an endpoint of ) @xmath12 and is right of ( or an endpoint of ) @xmath13 , with @xmath4 not an endpoint of both arcs .",
