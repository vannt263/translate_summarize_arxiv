    "it has been recognised for a long time that , just as the confining string - like interquark potential provides a good basis for understanding valence quark dynamics , so the breaking of the string provides a natural way of understanding the influence of sea quarks on decay processes @xcite .",
    "lattice measurements of the confining qcd potential , in quenched and unquenched calculations , are well understood @xcite .",
    "moreover the simplest type of quark model using this potential gives a reasonable account of the observed heavy meson spectrum .",
    "recently there has been progress in the attempt to observe string breaking effects directly on the lattice @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how sufficiently accurate lattice measurements of the interquark potential and string breaking effects might be combined to implement a programme of computation of decay rates for heavy quark systems .",
    "the analysis depends on a two - channel mixing picture of the string breaking process suggested by a crude model proposed previously @xcite .",
    "the basis of the mechanism is the fact that the light quark - anti - quark pair is produced ( or absorbed ) in a triplet spin state .",
    "although our picture of string breaking is different in detail from that of isgur and paton @xcite the results are still consistent with the phenomenological @xmath6-model  .",
    "the crude model described previously @xcite , was designed to provide a simple two - channel mixing model of string breaking .",
    "it suggests that when the string breaks each light quark and anti - quark materialises in the neighbourhood of the appropriate static anti - quark or quark . in this respect",
    "it differs from the string breaking model of isgur and paton @xcite who viewed the materialisation of the light quark - anti - quark pair as a local event on the string . as a justification of our picture we point out that to a first approximation the local gauge field energy density does not change as the static quarks are separated .",
    "there is no real mechanism therefore for the local production of the light pair .",
    "the breaking event is only possible when the total energy distributed along the string is sufficient to support light pair creation .",
    "our model then suggests that this creation occurs essentially instantaneously in such a way that the gauge field distribution supported by the static quarks is cancelled by the opposing gauge field structure of the light quarks .",
    "it is this idea of instantaneous transition that we exploit below in our development of the model .",
    "however the outcome of the these considerations is not in contradiction with the @xmath6 model that is supported by the analysis of isgur and paton , at least for the decay processes to which we apply our ideas .",
    "as was pointed out in the original description of the crude model @xcite , the dynamical quark - anti - quark pair are produced in a correlated spin state .",
    "here we examine this mechanism a little more closely . in the model the strong coupling graph that corresponds to the production of the pair is shown in fig 1  .",
    "the quark or anti - quark binds in an @xmath7-wave with the appropriate static anti - quark or quark .",
    "choosing 0 as the ( imaginary ) time direction and 1 as the direction of spatial separation of the static quarks , we see that the rules for quark propagation @xcite yield an amplitude with spin structure of the form = ( 0&_1 + 0&0 )  . this can be interpreted as meaning that the light quark - anti - quark pair are produced with a spin wave function _",
    "=(_i_i)_  , [ lqwf1 ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spin labels for the quark and anti - quark respectively and @xmath10 is the unit vector pointing along the line of separation of the the static quarks .",
    "this shows that the light quark - anti - quark pair are produced in a triplet state with zero spin component along the line of separation of the static quarks .",
    "in order to explain the basic idea we first consider a model in which the particles of the theory have no spin but do experience confinement .",
    "the non - abelian higgs models are of this type @xcite .",
    "moreover they exhibit string breaking on the lattice of a type consistent with a two - channel mixing scenario @xcite .",
    "the channels involved are    a static quark - anti - quark @xmath11 system with a separation @xmath12 and with a connecting flux string    a heavy - light meson - meson system @xmath13  . for the moment",
    ", we ignore the spins of the quarks and treat them as scalar particles .    on the lattice it is possible to measure the string - string correlator @xmath14 as the @xmath15 wilson loop .",
    "it has the form _",
    "ss(t)~e^-v_q|q(r)t  , where @xmath16 can be interpreted as the interquark potential experienced by the static quarks .",
    "lattice measurents are consistent with the cornell potential @xcite v_q|q(r)=c-+r  , [ cornell ] where @xmath17 is the string tension .",
    "the correlator for two - meson states over the time interval @xmath18 can be obtained from measurements of observables appropriate to the two - meson state .",
    "its behaviour is of the form _",
    "mm(t)~e^-e_mm(r)t  , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the energy of a single static meson and @xmath21 is the potential interaction between the two static mesons .",
    "this potential energy has not been measured in qcd but does show up in the higgs model calculations .",
    "we might expect it to have a form like @xcite v_mm(r)=w_me^-mr  , [ transv ] where @xmath22 is the mass of a light meson that can be exchanged between the heavy mesons and @xmath23 is an energy determining the overall strength of the interaction .",
    "this description is of course an oversimplification in the presence of dynamical matter fields .",
    "this is clear from the higgs model calculations @xcite and in qcd from the thermal polyakov loop calculations @xcite .",
    "the reason is that string breaking can occur as a process that leads to a mixing of the string and two - meson states .",
    "consistently with these static model calculations we may represent the mixing process by a transition potential @xmath24  . on the basis of the crude model we might expect it to have the form @xcite",
    "v_i(r)=we^-m_qr  , [ transpot ] where @xmath25 is the mass of the dynamical matter field and @xmath26 is the energy parameter determining the strength of the transition potential .",
    "it follows that we are dealing with a two - channel interaction matrix of the form v(r)=(v_q|q(r)&v_i(r ) + v_i(r)&e_mm(r ) )  .",
    "the energies measured directly on the lattice are the eigenvalues of @xmath27  .",
    "they are v_(r)=\\{v_q|q(r)+e_mm(r ) }  .",
    "[ eigv ] we keep the convention used previously that @xmath28 is the lower of the two eigenenergies . if @xmath24 is sufficiently small then the eigenenergies are dominated by the diagonal elements of @xmath27  . we can define a critical value of @xmath29 for which these diagonal values are equal v_q|q(r_c)=e_mm(r_c )  .",
    "when @xmath30 the the split in the eigenenergies is proportional to @xmath31 , we have v_(r_c)=v_q|q(r_c)v_i(r_c )  .",
    "for @xmath32 we expect @xmath33 with the result @xmath34 and @xmath35  . for @xmath36",
    "we expect @xmath37 with the result @xmath38 and @xmath39  .",
    "the interchange that occurs near @xmath30 is the mixing phenomenon . just as in refs @xcite we can compute a mixing angle @xmath40 given by =  .",
    "we have v(r)=o(v_+(r)&0 + 0&v_-(r))o^-1  , where o=(&- + & ) [ ortho ] as @xmath12 passes from below to above @xmath29 , the mixing angle increases from 0 to @xmath41 hitting @xmath42 when @xmath30  .",
    "the goal then is to use lattice measurements to determine the eigenenergies and the @xmath12-dependence of the mixing angle . by those means we can determine the full two - channel interaction matrix , @xmath27  .",
    "we discuss this in more detail below .",
    "once we know the elements of @xmath27 we can make the two - channel equivalent of the born - oppenheimer approximation and replace the static quarks by heavy non - relativistic quarks and mesons .",
    "the effective schrdinger equation is i()=(-2&0 + 0&-2)()+v(r ) ( )  , [ se ] where ( ) = ( _ q ( ) + _ m ( ) )  , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the reduced masses for the heavy quarks and heavy mesons in their respective channels .",
    "these also can be obtained from appropriate lattice measurements of heavy single meson states .",
    "we can exploit eq([se ] ) by first ignoring the off - diagonal elements of @xmath27  .",
    "we then calculate the heavy @xmath45 bound states with energies @xmath46  .",
    "if this energy lies above the two - meson channel threshold then we can compute the decay rate as = 2(k)|t(k)|^2  , [ gr1 ] where @xmath46 is the energy of the bound state @xmath45 system in the potential @xmath16  , @xmath47 is the relative momentum of the final state mesons , @xmath48 is the density of states factor .",
    "the energy of the two - meson state is @xmath49 which satisfies e(k)=k^2 + 2e_m = e_q|q  .",
    "the transition amplitude is t(k)=|v_i|_q  , @xmath50 being the wavefunction , with incoming scattered wave , for the two meson system in the presence of the potential @xmath21  . as a first approximation we could neglect the the final state interactions represented by the scattered part of the the wave function and replace @xmath50 with the plane wave @xmath51  .",
    "we have then t(k)=d^3e^-i.v_i(r)_q(r ) = 4_0^drr^2()v_i(r)_q(r )  . [ gr2 ] in the above it",

    "on the lattice we can measure @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "if we are confident of our parametrizations of the elements of @xmath27 , then it is likely that we can determine them by performing a fit to the eigenenergies provided they are known sufficiently accurately and on a sufficiently fine spatial lattice .    in principle , the the eigenenergies are not sufficient to fix the elements of @xmath27  . a superior approach , therefore , would be to measure also the mixing angle @xmath40  .",
    "the results obtained in the @xmath55-higgs models for the @xmath12-dependence of the ground state overlap of the lower eigenmode suggest that this may well be possible @xcite  .",
    "the two - channel model suggests that the contribution of the lower energy eigenmode to the wilson loop is _",

    "if the left sides of these equations do show a lack of dependence on @xmath12 then we would have a good test of the the above coupling hypothesis .",
    "it is not obvious that all sets of operators have this property but it may be possible to construct a sufficient set",
    ". however we might reasonably expect in general that the @xmath12-dependence of these quantities is relatively weak compared to that induced by the rapid variation of the mixing angle through the mixing region .    on the assumption that an acceptable set of operators can be found ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath12 can be elucidated by examining the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is any appropriate @xmath60-vector .",

    "clearly the point @xmath69 lies on a circle and @xmath40 is the angle , referred to an appropriate origin , that fixes the position of the point on the circle .",
    "static quark calculations are particularly relevant to the spectator quark approximation in which , except for determining multiplicities , the heavy quark spins play essentially no rle .",
    "of course in the physical case of bottomonium , the small mass differences associated with the hyper - fine structure of the @xmath1-mesons are crucial in determining allowed decays .",
    "these effects are however essentially kinematic and will be taken into account at the appropriate point . in examining the basic phenomenon of string breaking",
    "we will temporarily omit these spins from consideration .",

    "our crude model provides a generalization of the scalar case to that of light quarks with spin .",
    "it remains a two - channel mixing problem because the light quark - anti - quark pair emerges in a triplet spin state with definite orientation .",
    "we can achieve this result by introducing a transition potential of the form v()=(v_q|q(r)&v_ms ( ) + v^_ms()&e_mm(r ) )  , [ pot ] where now the spin label structure of the transition element is given by v_ms()=v_i(r)(_i_i)_  .",

    "the transition rate is then = 2_i(k)|t_i()|^2  , [ decayrate ] where t_i()=  i|v_ms()|_q  , and @xmath74 is the polarization state of the triplet spin wavefunction . in principle",
    "the state @xmath75 should be a solution of the the scattering problem with the potential @xmath21 .",
    "if we make the approximation of neglecting final state interactions we can set |  i = _ie^i .  .",
    "we have then t_i()=d^3e^-i.\\{_iv_ms()}_q(r )  .",

    "[ gr3 ] note that @xmath76 for small @xmath77  .",
    "this is the angular momentum barrier associated with the @xmath78-wave final state .",
    "currently there is no detailed information on string breaking in qcd at zero temperature although there is a strong indication of the mixing effect at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the latest measurement of the @xmath79 potential with dynamical quarks does not show an unequivocal mixing effect directly @xcite .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the mixing scenario if the mixing range in @xmath12 and the split in eigenenergies at maximal mixing is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to reverse the above argument and use the information on the decay of the @xmath80 to @xmath81 to estimate the energy split at maximum mixing that we should expect to see on the lattice .",
    "the theory also enables us to make predictions for other bottomonium decays .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the heavy - heavy and heavy - light quark systems has a strong effect on the relative positions of masses and thresholds and hence on decay rates . in order to make use of experimental results therefore , it is necessary to reinstate the spins of the heavy quarks . to compute the decay rates of real processes , we must take into account the spin structure of the open final state channels in order to assign the correct momenta to them .",

    "we have examined the relevance of string breaking to the decay of heavy quark systems .",
    "the anaysis shows how string breaking on the lattice can be related to the decay rates for such processes as @xmath95  .",
    "the central idea is that the string breaking can be viewed as a two channel process .",
    "this is controlled by a @xmath96 potential matrix of which the diagonal elements represent the interquark potential and the energy and interaction potential of two static mesons .",
    "the off - diagonal elements correspond to a transition potential between the two channels .",
    "just as the interquark potential can be used in a dynamical calculation of heavy quark states so the transition potential can be used to compute the transition rate from the bound quark system to two freely moving heavy mesons .",
    "this is a standard relatively non - controversial quantum mechanics calculation .",
    "the main assumption behind it is that the born - oppenheimer approximation that underpins the heavy quark calculation holds good when the transition matrix elements are included .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that there is no strong retardation effect in the transmission of the dynamical quark .",
    "if this quark mass is sufficiently low this assumption is not unreasonable .    at the moment",
    "there are no measurements in qcd that permit an accurate realization of the scheme . however , with some simplifying assumptions on the form of the elements of the potential matrix , it is possible to make a preliminary calculation of the decay rate of the @xmath80 in terms of the energy parameter @xmath26 , yielding a value @xmath97 mev .",
    "this gives rise to an eigenenergy split of @xmath98 mev .",
    "although this suggests that the split may be hard to detect on the lattice the study of mixing remains an important goal because of its physical significance .",
    "our analysis also strongly supports the desirability of measuring an appropriate suite of operators for the purpose of measuring the movement of the mixing angle @xcite .",
    "in fact , as indicated in @xcite , it would be very useful in estimating @xmath99 to measure the transition amplitude for string to two mesons in the quenched appoximation @xcite .    taking the above value of @xmath26 as a guide",
    "we are able to use the formalism to compute the partial widths for @xmath5-decay .",
    "we find that the dominant decay is through the @xmath100 channel .",
    "our computed total width is roughly half the measured width .",
    "we feel that this result is not unreasonable given the preliminary character of the calculation and the limited information available from experiment on decay channels .",
