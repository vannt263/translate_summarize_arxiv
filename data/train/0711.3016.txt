    "this shows the role of the topology of the underlying graph on critical behaviour .",
    "moreover , networks constitute a path toward a more `` realistic '' system of mean - field models , the main cause being the introduction of ( finite ) connectivity as a parameter@xcite .",

    "the `` functionality '' of the network will be the ferromagnetic order of the model , and by `` resilience '' it means how strong is the spontaneous magnetization against random introduction of antiferromagnetic interaction that contributes to the disorder .",

    "the spontaneous magnetization is broken for sufficiently large values of @xmath83 in an abrupt way in the annealed case .",
    "on the other hand , the critical temperature for the quenched case decays slowly , and reaches @xmath88 for @xmath89 only ( see ( [ tq ] ) ) .",
    "one should remember , initially , that each vertex links to another @xmath90 with ferromagnetic interaction @xmath91 and an antiferromagnetic interaction ( which is much stronger in the sense that @xmath92 ) with probability @xmath93 .",
    "in the quenched case , where the configuration @xmath7 remains frozen during an observational time , only an infinitesimal fraction ( of @xmath94 ) of the links have antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "suppose that the edge @xmath95 ( shared between the vertices @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) is one of them ; this edge has a ferromagnetic component of intensity @xmath96 and an opposite effect of @xmath85 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "although the antiferromagnetic part exceeds the ferromagnetic one , the solely effect is make just the spins @xmath98 and @xmath99 having opposite signs .",
    "therefore , despite the fact that all the antiferromagnetic interactions dominates over the ferromagnetic interactions in the links where @xmath10 , the total number of such edges is much smaller than the total number of edges of the network ( the thermodynamic limit is taken for a fixed value of @xmath83 ) , which then becomes predominantely ferromagnetic .",
    "this is the cause of persistence of spontaneous magnetization for any finite @xmath83 , as shown in fig 2 ( left ) .    on the other hand , in the annealing approximation , where the antiferromagnetic links fluctuate during the observation time",
    ", one sees an `` averaged '' antiferromagnetic interaction between spins ( vertices ) .",
    "this means that , although the mean connectivity @xmath83 is fixed , the effective number of edges with an antiferromagnetic interaction is much larger ( and the effective intensity is also smaller than @xmath85 ) .",
    "heuristically speaking , the intensity @xmath85 is better distributed over the edges ( differently from the quenched case ) , and the antiferromagnetic effect is better exploited in the annealed case , which makes the magnetization vanishes even for finite values of @xmath83 .",
    "throughout this work , the static properties of a diluted antiferromagnet on a ferromagnetic background was examined , with particular emphasis on the breakdown of the spontaneous magnetization of the system .",
    "the phase diagram displayed a nonzero magnetization at low temperature regime for any finite mean connectivity @xmath83 of antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the disordered phase is constituted by a paramagnetic and a spin - glass phase .",
    "the critical temperature of the order - disorder transition , which indicates the breakdown of the magnetic order of the model , was determined from both the quenched and annealed approaches .",
    "the main difference , noticed from fig 2 , relies on the fact that the spontaneous magnetization vanishes for finite values of @xmath83 in the annealed approximation .",
    "this phenomena is observed due to the rapid fluctuation of the random variables @xmath7 , which distributes more efficiently the antiferromagnetic interactions over the whole graph .",
    "this means that in the present work , networks are resilient to non - fluctuating random `` attacks '' ( even strong ones ) , while they are weaker to `` annealing attacks '' , which turns the antiferromagnetic interaction more accessible to the edges , although weakening its mean strength .",
