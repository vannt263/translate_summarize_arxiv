    "the stars are forming in situ , it seems unlikely that the filamentary gas is simultaneously condensing ( into stars ) and evaporating ( causing coronal emission )  the simplest explanation is that the hot intracluster gas is cooling through the ovi transition and into molecular gas , before ultimately forming stars .",

    "if we assume that the ovi@xmath71038 emission is due to cooling intracluster gas , we can estimate the cooling rate following @xcite and @xcite .",

    "based on very deep x - ray data of the cooling filament ( ehlert et  al .",

    "thus , it is unclear exactly how the cooling will proceed .",
    "based on the measured ovi@xmath71038 flux , and following @xcite , we estimate a cooling rate of 0.85 @xmath9 0.15 ( stat ) @xmath9 0.20 ( sys ) m@xmath6 yr@xmath12 , where the systematic uncertainty includes expectation for isobaric ( 1.0 @xmath9 0.2 m@xmath6 yr@xmath12 ) and isochoric ( 0.7 @xmath9 0.2 m@xmath6 yr@xmath12 ) cooling .",
    "this cooling rate , which probes @xmath310@xmath2k gas , can be compared to both the x - ray cooling rate and the star formation rate , which probe the hot ( @xmath310@xmath19k ) and cold ( @xmath310k ) extremes , respectively .",
    "we estimate the classical cooling rate ( m@xmath62 = @xmath63 ) within the cos aperture to be @xmath31 m@xmath6 yr@xmath12 , assuming that , on small ( @xmath0kpc ) scales , the cooling icm is similar in morphology ( clumpiness ) to the uv continuum . based on our stellar population modeling (  3.2 )",
    ", we estimate an extinction - corrected star formation rate ( assuming continuous star formation ) within the cos aperture of 0.11 @xmath9 0.02 m@xmath6 yr@xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath16% of the gas cooling through 10@xmath2k is converted to stars .",
    "alternatively , some fraction of the ovi emission could come from a mixing layer , where hot electrons from the icm penetrate the cold filaments , following @xcite  correcting for this would raise the inferred star formation efficiency .",
    "however , we do not find an excess of optical line emission above the expectation given the uv continuum level , as is observed in ngc  1275 , suggesting that these effects are small in the filaments of abell  1795 .    for comparison ,",
    "@xcite find a total ovi - derived cooling rate of 42 @xmath9 9 m@xmath6 yr@xmath12 over the full core of a1795 , while the extinction - corrected star formation rate ( assuming @xmath64 = 0.1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) over the same area is only 5.2 m@xmath6 yr@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an efficiency of forming stars out of the 10@xmath2k gas of 12@xmath65% .",
    "this is also comparable to the star formation efficiency found by @xcite of 14@xmath66% based on x - ray spectroscopy and uv photometry .",
    "given that cooling flows are found to be @xmath31% efficient at converting the cooling icm into stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is important to understand at what temperatures the bulk of the gas is held up .",
    "assuming that the imf does indeed follow @xcite , we find , for the filaments in abell  1795 ( where the effects of agn feedback should be minimized ) , that the cooling efficiency at high temperatures is of order 100% ( @xmath67  @xmath68  m@xmath69/m@xmath70 @xmath3 0.71.0 ) , while the star formation efficiency is low ( @xmath71  @xmath68  sfr / m@xmath69  @xmath3  0.110.16 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found , using ovi observations from fuse , that @xmath67 was of order 10%  _ over the full cluster core _ for abell  1795 , abell  2597 , and perseus .",
    "this suggests that the cooling flow problem may be divided into two separate inefficiencies :    * @xmath72 : globally inefficient cooling at high temperatures ( 10@xmath19k @xmath73 10@xmath74k ) , due to some large - scale feedback source ( e.g. , agn ) ; * @xmath75 : locally inefficient cooling at low temperatures ( 10@xmath74k @xmath73 stars ) , manifesting as inefficient star formation .",
    "the latter , which we quantify here and in @xcite , may be low due to conduction suppressing cooling at low temperatures . for comparison ,",
    "star clusters in our galaxy have typical star formation efficiencies of @xmath3830% @xcite  in principle , star formation embedded in a hot plasma should proceed less efficiently .",
    "we present deep far - uv spectroscopy of a cooling filament in abell  1795 , obtained using the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ on hst .",
    "these data allow us to simultaneously probe the young stellar populations and the intermediate temperature ( 10@xmath2k ) gas .",
    "we find evidence for ongoing , in situ star formation , which suggests that the cool gas in these filaments was _ not _ stripped from an infalling galaxy .",
    "the detection of ovi  emission suggests that this star formation is being fueled by condensing intracluster gas , and that the cooling is proceeding efficiently at high temperatures , contrary to what is observed on large scales in cluster cores .",
    "we propose a scenario where the two orders of magnitude disagreement between luminosity - based x - ray cooling rates and star formation in cluster cores is due to a combination of globally - inefficient cooling at high temperatures ( @xmath72 ; e.g. , agn feedback ) and locally - inefficient star formation at low temperatures ( @xmath75 ) .",
