    "friction phenomena take place across a broad range of time and length scales , from microscopic atomistic processes , as in the gliding motion of a nanocluster or a nanomotor @xcite , up to extremely macroscopic instances , as in fault dynamics and earthquake events @xcite . due to the ubiquitous nature of mechanical dissipative processes and the enormous practical relevance ,",
    "friction has been investigated over the centuries . while the empirical laws of macroscopic friction are well known @xcite , the fundamental understanding of the tribological phenomena at the microscopic scales is still lacking from many points of view .",
    "the basic difficulty of friction is intrinsic , involving the dissipative dynamics of large systems , often across ill - characterized interfaces , and generally violent and nonlinear .",
    "the severity of the task is also related to the experimental difficulty to probe systems with many degrees of freedom under a forced spatial confinement , that leaves very limited access to probing the buried sliding interface . thanks to remarkable developments in nanotechnology , new inroads are being pursued and new discoveries are being made . at the nanometer scale ,",
    "state - of - the - art ultra - high - vacuum systems and local probe studies show a dynamical behavior which is often significantly different , not just quantitatively but even qualitatively , from the ones observed in macroscopic tribology . bridging",
    "the gap among the different length scales in tribological systems still remains an open challenge .",
    "the phenomenological descriptions that apply to macroscopic friction can not yet be derived from the fundamental atomic principles and the interplay of processes occurring at the molecular level .",
    "nanofriction is in somewhat better shape .",
    "together with the current experimental possibility to perform well - defined measurements on well - characterized materials at the fundamental microscopic level of investigation of the sliding contacts , advances in the computer modeling of interatomic interactions in materials science and complex systems encompass molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations of medium to large scale for the exploration of the tribo - dynamics with atomic resolution @xcite . despite the benefits brought about by numerical simulations of realistic 3d sliding systems ,",
    "the resulting proliferation of detailed complex data , and the requirement of always - growing computational efforts have stimulated , in parallel , the concurrent search for simpler modeling schemes , such as , e.g. , generalized prandtl - tomlinson ( pt ) , frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) , for nanofriction , and of burridge - knopoff and earthquake - like models , for mesoscale and macroscale friction , suitable to describe the essence of the physics involved in highly nonlinear and non - equilibrium tribological phenomena in a more immediate fashion .",
    "here we discuss current progress and open problems in the simulation and modeling of tribology at the microscopic scale , and its connection to the macroscale .",
    "neither the pt model , described in detail in several surveys @xcite with several applications to concrete tip - based physical systems , nor the phenomenological approach based on the rate - and - state models @xcite will be considered here . with a view to emphasize the role of nonlinearity the present topical review will restrict to the following theoretical approaches to sliding friction .",

    "statistical mechanics accounts for the intimate mechanism of friction : a system at equilibrium has its kinetic energy uniformly distributed among all its degrees of freedom .",
    "a sliding macroscopic object clearly is not at equilibrium : one of its degrees of freedom ( the center - of - mass motion ) has far more kinetic energy than any other .",
    "the tendency of the system toward equilibrium will lead to the transfer of energy from that degree of freedom to all other ones : as a result the macroscopic object will slow down and its energy will be transferred to the disordered motion of the other degrees of freedom , resulting in warming up .",
    "this is all sliding friction really is : the tendency of systems toward equilibrium energy equipartitioning among many interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , in the course of friction under an applied external force , energy is reversed into the system in the form of frictional heat .",
    "the frictional heat is generally dissipated by some form of heat bath , such as that provided by a thermostat at temperature @xmath0 . in a frictional steady state , caused for example by submitting a slider to an external force @xmath1 , the slider dissipates energy to the bath , and therefore does not accelerate indefinitely  it reaches instead a steady state characterized by an average drift velocity @xmath2 . when both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are infinitesimal , the relationship between the two quantities is linear , @xmath3 in this so - called `` viscous friction '' the proportionality constant @xmath4 is the linear friction coefficient .",
    "it is known from classical statistical mechanics , for example of brownian motion as described by the langevin equation , that for linear friction systems which obey eq .",
    "( [ erio-1 ] ) , the einstein relationship @xmath5 is generally valid , connecting the friction coefficient @xmath4 , which measures dissipation , to the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 , which measures fluctuations .",
    "this expresses the fluctuation - dissipation theorem of linear , viscous friction .      to simulate the classical motion of a macroscopic object moving in contact with an equilibrium bath such as the molecules of a gas or a liquid , or the phonons of a solid",
    ", the standard implementation @xcite requires adapting newton s equations of motion with the addition of a damping force @xmath7 plus a random force @xmath8 .",
    "the damping force represents the transfer of energy from the macroscopic object of mass @xmath9 to the heat bath , i.e.  dissipation : @xmath10 this formula , equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ erio-1 ] ) , assumes that the deviation from equilibrium is small , so that _ linear response _ holds : the restoring stokes force is linear in the perturbing velocity , and acts opposite to it to restore the @xmath11 equilibrium regime .",
    "this linear dependence is purely the lowest order term in a taylor expansion : there is no reason to expect the linear relation ( [ eq_langevin ] ) to extend to large velocity , and indeed e.g.  the drag friction of speeding objects in gases is well known to follow rayleigh s quadratic dependence on speed @xmath12 .",
    "the random - force term represents statistically the `` kicks '' that the objects experiences due to its interaction with the thermal bath . in the frame of reference of the thermal bath @xmath13 of course .",
    "the random term is the result of many very frequent collisions events , resulting in random forces uncorrelated with themselves except over very short time spans .",
    "more precisely , we assume there is some maximum time @xmath14 beyond which any correlation vanish : @xmath15 in addition , the assumption of thermal equilibrium ensures us that the bath is in a steady state , so that @xmath16 is independent of @xmath17 , and depends on @xmath18 only : the statistical properties of the random force are constant in time . in most practical situations",
    ", one can safely ignore the dynamics over a time scale of the order of @xmath14 or shorter .",
    "we are interested instead in the integral effect of @xmath19 over some time period @xmath17 that is long compared to @xmath14 .",
    "we can break up that integral into many pieces , each covering a duration @xmath14 : @xmath20 this integral is then a sum of many independent random terms , each drawn from the same distribution whose only relevant property is that it has zero mean value . as a result of the central - limit theorem",
    ", the total integral obeys a gaussian distribution with null mean , and whose standard deviation scales with the number of terms in the sum , i.e.  @xmath21 .    by taking the equation of motion in the absence of any external driving , @xmath22 and integrating it in time",
    "we obtain @xmath23 the first term at the right - hand side of eq .",

    "relation @xmath36 this expression draws an explicit link between the autocorrelation amplitude of the fluctuations and the product of the dissipation coefficient and thermostat temperature . note that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ fluctdiss ] ) depends on both the amplitude of fluctuations @xmath37 and the time over which they remain self - correlated .",
    "the effect on the mesoscale object increases if the random force is larger and/or if the time interval over which @xmath37 pushes in the same direction before changing is longer .",
    "the relation ( [ fluctdiss ] ) can be equally well satisfied by weaker random forces acting for longer correlation times or stronger forces with shorter @xmath14 , which thus lead to the same statistical effects . as @xmath14 is the shortest time scale around , for all practical purpose",
    "one can satisfy eq .",
    "( [ fluctdiss ] ) assuming a sort of @xmath38 limit : @xmath39 providing a simple recipe for computer simulations . for simulations of models such as the pt or fk ones , the phenomenological degrees of freedom",
    "are often coupled to a langevin thermostat of this kind , implying that each degree of freedom is actually coupled to a vast number of other bath degrees of freedom . even in md simulations of atomic - scale friction ,",
    "langevin thermostats are applied to all or a part of the atoms involved @xcite .",
    "of course , this approach is not rigorous , since the relevant particles colliding with each given simulated atom are already all included in the conservative and deterministic forces explicitly accounted for by the `` force field '' .",
    "the langevin approach is quite accurate to describe small perturbations away from equilibrium , but it may fail quite badly in the strongly out - of - equilibrium nonlinear phenomena which are the target of the present paper .      in the rest of this review we will deal with nonlinear frictional phenomena , which deviate violently from linearity and near - equilibrium , and where therefore eqs .",
    "( [ erio-1 ] ) and  ( [ erio-2 ] ) do not generally apply .",
    "as it has , surprisingly , only been realized in the last few decades , even arbitrarily violently non - equilibrium and nonlinear driven phenomena adhere to an extension of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "that is the jarzynski ( or jarzynski  crooks ) relation @xcite , whose simplest form can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "suppose starting from a system in state a at temperature @xmath0 , and apply an external force of arbitrary form and strength causing it to evolve , for example to slide , to another state b ; assume for simplicity b to be also a state of equilibrium .",
    "call @xmath40 the work done by the external force , and call @xmath41 the difference of equilibrium free energy between the states b and a. clearly , @xmath42 must be valid , because some work will be wasted in going from a to b , unless that was done infinitely slowly ( adiabatically ) .",
    "suppose now repeating the forced motion a@xmath43b many times .",
    "each time , @xmath40 will be different .",
    "the jarzynski equality states that @xmath44 it can be shown that in near - equilibrium conditions , eq .",
    "( [ erio-4 ] ) is completely equivalent to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the beauty of it is however that eq .",
    "( [ erio-4 ] ) is totally general .",
    "one particular case is useful in order to underline its far - reaching power .",
    "suppose to take b = a , that is a final state identical to the starting one .",
    "in that case @xmath45 this equation appears at first sight impossible to satisfy , because surely all @xmath46 : all forced motion must cost work .",
    "the answer is that the probability @xmath47 is indeed a distribution centered around a positive @xmath48 , but with a nonzero tail extending to @xmath49 .",
    "this tail represents rare events where work is gained rather than spent  we can think of them as a sort of `` free lunches '' .",
    "jarzynski s theorem requires that `` free lunches '' must occur precisely in such a measure to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ erio-5 ] ) .",
    "however it is easy to convince ourselves that they will be frequent only in microscopic systems , where @xmath47 is broad . the larger the system involved , the narrower @xmath47 will be , the rarer and rarer the occurrence of `` free lunches '' . in a macroscopic friction experiment , the occurrence of a `` free lunch",

    "in nanoscale tribology , extensive attention has focused on the time - honored pt model , which describes a point - like tip sliding over a space - periodic crystalline surface in a minimal fashion .",
    "we shall omit this model from the present review , since it is covered in great detail elsewhere @xcite .",

    "@xcite and later introduced independently to address the dynamics of dislocations in crystals @xcite , subsequently this model became the paradigm describing the structure and dynamics of adsorbed monolayers in the context of surface physics .",
    "the standard fk model consists of a 1d chain of @xmath50 classical particles ( `` atoms '' ) , interacting via harmonic forces and moving in a sinusoidal potential , as sketched in fig .  [",

    "the final cosine term describes the `` substrate corrugation '' , i.e.  the periodic potential of amplitude @xmath55 and period @xmath56 , as experienced by all particles alike . to probe static friction ,",
    "all atoms are driven by an external force @xmath1 , which is increased adiabatically until sliding starts .",
    "the continuum limit of the fk model , appropriate for large @xmath53 , is the exactly integrable sine - gordon ( sg ) equation , and this mapping contributed to the great success of the fk model .",
    "the solutions of the sg model include nonlinear topological solitons ( known as `` kinks '' and `` antikinks '' ) , plus dynamical solitons ( `` breathers '' ) , beside linear vibration waves ( phonons ) . in the fk model , the sliding processes are entirely governed by its topological excitations , the kinks .",
    "let us consider the simplest `` commensurate '' case , where before sliding the chain is in a trivial ground state ( gs ) , when @xmath50 atoms fit one in each of the @xmath57 minima of the substrate potential , so that the coverage ( i.e.  the relative atomic concentration ) @xmath58 equals @xmath59 . in this case ,",
    "the addition ( or subtraction ) of a single atom results in configurations of the chain characterized by one kink ( or antikink ) excitation . still at zero applied force , in order to reach a local minimum of the total potential energy in eq .",
    "( [ fkhamil ] ) , the kink expands in space over a finite length , so that the resulting relaxed chain configuration consists in a local compression ( or expansion , for an antikink ) . upon application of a force ,",
    "it is far easier to move along the chain for kinks than for atoms , since the activation energy @xmath60 for a kink displacement [ known as the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) barrier ] is systematically smaller , and often much smaller @xcite , than the amplitude @xmath55 of the energy barrier that single atoms experience in the substrate corrugation .    the motion of kinks ( antikinks ) , i.e.  the displacement of the extra atoms ( vacancies ) represents the mechanism for mass transport along the chain .",
    "these displacements are responsible for the mobility , diffusivity , and conductivity within this model .",
    "generally therefore a larger concentration of kinks is associated to a larger the overall mobility @xcite . for the simple commensurate gs ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) , which contains neither kinks nor antikinks , the onset of sliding motion under a driving force occurs via the creation of a kink - antikink pair , e.g.  induced by a thermal fluctuation ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ kinks ] .",
    "if the fk chain is of finite length , kinks / antikinks are usually created at one chain free end , then they advance along the chain , eventually disappearing at the opposite end @xcite .",
    "every kink running from one end of the chain to the other produces the advancement of the entire chain by one lattice spacing @xmath56 . for a finite film confined between two surfaces , or for an island deposited on a surface",
    ", the general expectation is that sliding initiates likewise with the formation and entrance of a kink , or antikink at the boundary @xcite . in this two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , and more generally in @xmath6-dimensional systems , the zero - dimensional kinks of the fk model are replaced by @xmath62 dimensional misfit dislocations or domain walls , whose qualitative physics and role is essentially the same .",
    "incommensurability between the periods @xmath56 and @xmath54 plays an important role in the fk model .",
    "assume , in the limit of an infinite chain length , the ratio @xmath63 of the substrate period @xmath56 to the average spacing @xmath54 of the chain to be irrational .",
    "the gs of the resulting incommensurate fk model is characterized by a sort of `` staircase '' deformation , with a regular sequence of regions where the chain is compressed ( or expanded ) to match the periodic potential , separated by kinks ( or antikinks ) , where , at regular intervals , the misfit stress is released through a localized expansion ( compression ) .",
    "the incommensurate fk model exhibits , under fairly general conditions on @xmath64 @xcite , a critical elastic constant @xmath65 , such that if @xmath66 the chain can slide freely on the substrate at no energy cost , i.e.  the static friction @xmath67 drops to zero ( and the low - velocity kinetic friction becomes extremely small ) , while , remarkably , this is no longer true when @xmath68 . in the early 1980s a rigorous mathematical theory of this phenomenon called `` the transition by breaking of analyticity '' , now widely known as the _ aubry transition _",
    "@xcite , was developed .",
    "a simple explanation of free sliding in the unpinned @xmath69 state is the following .",
    "for every atom climbing up toward a corrugation potential maximum , there always is another atom moving down , with an exact energy balance of these processes . quite generally , incommensurability guarantees that the total energy ( we are at @xmath70 ) is independent of the relative position of the chain and the periodic lattice .",
    "however , in order for the chain to slide with continuity between two consecutive positions , it is necessary that particles should be able to occupy a maximum of the potential , the worst possible position . at the aubry transition , however , realized by a relative increase of the periodic potential magnitude , or equivalently by a softening of the chain stiffness , the probability for a particle to occupy that position drops from a finite value to exactly zero .",
    "the nature of this transition , which is structural but without any other static order parameter ( besides energy , of course ) , is dynamical , similar in that to a glass transition : simply , a part of phase space becomes unavailable , in this case by sliding .",
    "the chain is unpinned and mobile as long as , in its gs , atoms may occupy with a finite probability all positions , including those arbitrarily close to the maxima of the substrate potential , but is immobilized when that possibility ceases .",
    "the critical chain stiffness @xmath65 marks the crossing of the aubry transition , where the chain turns from the free sliding state to the locked ( `` pinned '' ) state with a nonzero static friction @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath71 is in turn a discontinuous function on the length ratio @xmath64 characterizing the model .",
    "the minimum value @xmath72 [ in units of @xmath73 is achieved for the golden - mean ratio @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the stiff - spring chain with @xmath75 can explore adiabatically the full infinite and continuous set of gss configurations by means of displacements at no energy cost .",
    "this zero - frequency freely - sliding mode is the goldstone mode consistent with an emerging continuous translational invariance of the model , connecting continuously with an acoustical phase mode ( phason ) at finite wavelength .",
    "by contrast , in the pinned soft - chain region @xmath76 , all particles remain trapped close to the substrate - potential minima , a configuration which exhibits a finite energy barrier against motion over the corrugation .",
    "the locking is provided here , despite translational invariance , by the inaccessibility of forbidden configurations , which act as dynamical constraints . above @xmath71",
    "the incommensurate - chain sliding can therefore be initiated by an arbitrarily small driving force , whereas for @xmath68 the chain and the corrugation lock together through the pinning of the kinks or superkinks separating locally lattice - matched regions .",
    "note that the locking of the free ends in a finite - size fk chain necessarily leads to pinning , even when @xmath64 is irrational and regardless of how large @xmath53 is . even for a finite chain ,",
    "it is nevertheless still possible to define and detect a symmetry - breaking aubry - like transition @xcite .",
    "for the characterization of the aubry transition , a `` disorder '' parameter @xmath77 was conveniently defined @xcite as the smallest distance of atoms from the nearest maximum of the corrugation potential .",
    "this quantity vanishes in the freely - sliding state , and is nonzero in the pinned state . at the critical pinned - to - sliding point ,",
    "the disorder parameter exhibits a power - law behavior @xmath78 here the values of the critical exponents are functions of the irrational length ratio @xmath64 .",

    "the resulting features include mainly new types of dynamical solitons ( supersonic waves ) , a modification of the kink - kink interaction , the breaking of the kink - antikink symmetry , and even the possibility of a chain rupture associated to the excessive stretching of an antikink @xcite . the large kink - antikink asymmetry consistent with friction experiments in layers of repulsive colloids @xcite was attributed to the strong anharmonicity in the colloid - colloid interaction @xcite .",

    "the pinned phases retain local stability for a range of parameters that extends beyond the transition point , a point where the total energy has a crossing singularity instead of a smooth stiffness dependence as in 1d .",
    "it is likely , although not proven to our knowledge , that the 2d fk should possess a first - order aubry transition too .    among generalized 2d fk models we recall the two coupled fk chains @xcite , the `` balls and springs '' layer of particles linked in 2d by harmonic springs and moving in a 2d periodic corrugation potential , the scalar anisotropic 2d fk model consisting of a coupled array of 1d fk chains , the 2d vector anisotropic model ( namely the zigzag fk model where",

    "an explicit demonstration of this mechanism was carried out by the study of a mismatched fk chain , whose dynamics was forced and simultaneously probed by an oscillating localized model tip @xcite .",
    "this approach illustrates the ability of the fk model to capture the local modifications of the dissipation properties .",
    "in contrast , if retardation effects related to the finite speed of sound across a material need to be taken into account , more sophisticated models are called for .",
    "the investigation of systems _ confined _ between two shearing sliders , such as single particles @xcite or harmonic chains @xcite embedded between competing periodic potentials , have led to the discovery of several nonlinear tribological phenomena involving either stick - slip dynamics or the formation of peculiar `` synchronized '' sliding regimes @xcite .",
    "the fk model can be generalized with the addition of a second , different sinusoidal corrugation potential , as sketched in fig .",

    "specifically , the ratio of the lubricant speed to that of the slider @xmath123 remains locked to specific `` plateau '' values across broad ranges of most model parameters , including the potential magnitude of the two sliders , the chain stiffness ( see fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig]a ) , the dissipation rate @xmath4 , and even the external velocity @xmath124 itself .",

    "the plateau mechanism is the fact that the kinks formed by the mismatch of the chain with one slider ( the slider whose spatial periodicity is closest to that of the chain ) , are rigidly dragged at velocity @xmath124 by the other slider .",
    "the kink density being geometrically determined and lower than the chain density implies that the overall velocity ratio shares exactly the same properties .",
    "the exactness of the velocity plateaus implies a sort of `` dynamical incompressibility '' , identically zero compliance to perturbations trying to modify @xmath129 from its quantized - plateau value .",
    "this robustness of the plateaus can be demonstrated e.g.  by adding a constant force @xmath130 , pushing all particles in the chain : as long as @xmath130 is small enough , it does perturb the dynamics of the velocity - plateau attractor , but not the value of @xmath129 . eventually , above a critical force @xmath131 , the driven model abandons the plateau dynamics .",
    "this transition , explored by increasing the external driving force @xmath132 , exhibits a broad hysteresis , and shares many features of the _ static_-friction depinning transition , except that here it takes place `` on the fly '' @xcite . disregarding details , this transition is then formally equivalent to the standard aubry depinning transition @xcite , with the moving kinks of the lubricant - substrate interface taking here the role of particles .",

    "thanks to advances in computing algorithms and hardware , recent years have witnessed a remarkable increase in our ability to simulate tribologic processes in realistic nano - frictional systems , and obtain detailed microscopic information .",
    "a md simulation is _ de facto _ a controlled computational experiment , where the overall atomic dynamics is provided by the numerical solutions of suitably generalized newton s equation of motion relying on interatomic forces derived by specific realistic interparticle - interaction potentials .",
    "tribological simulations require a careful selection of the geometric arrangement of the sliding interface , e.g.  as in fig .  [",

    "the simplest approach to temperature control , namely adding a langevin thermostat to newton s equations @xcite , has been adopted broadly , but more refined approaches have been proposed and adopted for friction simulations , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ thermostat : sect ] below .",
    "physically relevant quantities , including the average friction force , the slider and the lubricant mean velocities , several correlation functions , and the heat flow can be evaluated numerically by carrying out suitable averages over the model dynamics of a sliding interface , as long as it is followed for a sufficiently long time .",
    "the modeling of friction must first of all address correctly ordinary equilibrium and near - equilibrium phenomena , where the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( sec .",
    "[ linear : sec ] ) governs the smooth conversion of mechanical energy into heat , but most importantly it must also deal with inherently nonlinear dissipative phenomena such as instabilities , stick - slip , and all kinds of hysteretic response to external driving forces , characteristic of non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the choice of realistic interatomic forces is often a major problem . indicating with @xmath134 the total interaction energy as a function of all atomic coordinates @xmath135 , the force on atom @xmath136 is @xmath137 , fully determined in terms of @xmath138 .",
    "unfortunately , the adiabatic energy @xmath138 results from the solution of the quantum ground state of the electrons  a practically complicated problem whose quantitative outcome may moreover be of uncertain quality .",
    "the reason why _ ab - initio _",
    "md , e.g.  of the car - parrinello type @xcite , is not generally used in sliding friction is that it can neither handle large systems , exceeding few hundreds of atoms , nor run for tribologically significant duration , usually in excess of @xmath139  ns . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical situations where a first - principles description of interatomic forces is mandatory are not too common in the frictional phenomena studied so far . as a consequence ,",
    "most md models for friction rely on more or less refined interatomic `` force fields '' , ranging from sophisticated energy surfaces modeled on calculations at _ ab - initio _ density - functional or tight - binding level @xcite , to empirical distance- and angle - dependent many - body classical potentials , to basic pairwise potentials ( e.g.  morse or lennard - jones ) , to the simplest elastic - springs models , which represent generalizations of the fk model . concretely , the scientific literature documents many realistic force fields , ready to address several classes of materials and their combinations @xcite .",
    "while these force fields allow qualitative atomistic simulations of tribological systems , their limitations often prevent quantitative accuracy . in particular , in the course of such a violent frictional process as wear , atoms are likely to modify their chemical coordination and even their charge state : phenomena and radical chemical changes usually impossible to describe with empirical force fields .",
    "mechanochemistry and tribochemistry are time - honored areas @xcite offering obvious examples where empirical force - fields would fail , and simulations must by necessity be conducted by electronic - structure based first - principles methods .",
    "also , even if for a specific system , element or compound , a satisfactory force field has been arrived at , the mere replacement of one atomic species with another one generally requires a complete and usually difficult re - parameterization of the whole force field . as a result ,",
    "quantitatively accurate nanofrictional investigations remain a substantial challenge because of opposite limitations in the use of first principles versus empirical force fields . a promising compromise could possibly be provided by the so - called reactive potentials @xcite , capable of describing some chemical reactions , including interface wear with satisfactory computational efficiency in large - scale atomic simulations , compared to semi - empirical and first - principles approaches .",
    "retardation effects due to the finiteness of the speed of sound are usually irrelevant in slow - speed experiments ( @xmath140  mm / s ) . for larger speed",
    ", retardation effects related to the finite speed of sound can be taken into account explicitly in md modeling , provided that rigid layers are either omitted or introduced with special care .",
    "other effects of nonlocality in time , such as retardation due to the finite speed of light @xcite are usually omitted in the md force fields altogether , as they lead to negligible corrections in all conditions where sliding involves a proper material contact .",
    "such retardation effects do play a role in noncontact geometries , such as in experiments probing lateral casimir forces @xcite , whose strength can become relevant at large sliding speed @xcite .      as we already mentioned above in sec .",
    "[ linear : sec ] , any kind of sliding friction involves mechanical work , some of which is then transformed into heat ( the rest going into structural transformations , wear , etc . ) .",
    "the heat is then transported away by phonons ( and electrons in the case of metallic sliders ) and eventually dissipated to the environment .",
    "likewise , all excitations generated at the sliding interface in simulations should be allowed to propagate away from it , and to disperse in the bulk of both sliders . instead , due to the small simulation size , this energy may unphysically pile up in the rather small portion of solid representative of the `` bulk '' of the substrates , where these excitations are scattered and back - reflected by the simulation - cell boundary , instead of being properly dissipated away . in order to prevent continuous heating and attain a steady state of the tribological system , the joule heat must then be removed at a steady rate . in the fk and pt models , a viscous damping term @xmath82 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_langevin ] ) , is generally introduced for this purpose . in these minimal models",
    "however , the value of @xmath4 is well known to affect the dynamical and frictional properties , but there is unfortunately no clear prescription for the choice of @xmath4 . in md atomistic simulations ,",
    "the heat removal is often achieved by means of equilibrium thermostats , e.g.  nos - hoover or langevin , see sec .",
    "[ fluctdiss : sec ] . in this way",
    "however an unphysical energy sink is spread throughout the simulation cell . as a result , the atoms at the interface fail to follow their actual conservative trajectories , but evolve through an unphysically damped dynamics , with unknown and generally undesired effects on the overall tribological properties @xcite . in order to address and mitigate this problem , modifications of the equations of motion for the atoms inside the microscopically small simulation cell were proposed with the target of reproducing the frictional dynamics of a realistic macroscopic system , after the integration of extra `` environment '' variables .",
    "one possible approach is the application of langevin equations with a damping coefficient that changes as a function of the position and velocity of each atom in the lubricant , in accordance with the dissipation known for the atoms adsorbed on a surface @xcite .",
    "this method involves modifying the standard langevin equations @xcite .",
    "another approach to improve the simulation of dissipation within blocks in reciprocal motion requires modifying the damping term ( [ eq_langevin ] ) to a form @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the average center - mass velocity of the atoms forming the sliding block to which particle @xmath143 belongs locally @xcite . another more rigorous , physically appealing approach is the recently - implemented dissipation scheme , drawing on earlier , long - known formulations @xcite and subsequent derivations @xcite , describing the correct embedding of the newtonian simulation cluster inside a larger heat bath made of the same material . upon integrating out the heat bath degrees of freedom , atoms in the boundary layer that borders between the cluster and the heat bath",
    "are subjected to additional non - conservative and non - markovian forces that mimic the surrounding bath through a so - called memory kernel .",
    "an approximate but very practical scheme replaces this memory kernel by a simple viscous damping @xmath4 , here applied exclusively to atoms in the boundary layer .",
    "the magnitude of the parameter @xmath4 is optimized variationally by minimizing , with surprising accuracy , the energy reflected across the boundary @xcite .",
    "this dissipation scheme has been implemented recently in nanofriction simulations where it was shown to improve greatly over other conceptually and practically inadequate thermostats .    besides the limitations of system size and simulation times that are obvious and will be discussed later",
    ", there is another limitation concerning temperature , that is rarely mentioned .",
    "all classical frictional simulations , atomistic or otherwise , are only valid at sufficiently high temperature .",
    "they become in principle invalid at low temperatures where the mechanical degrees of freedom of solids progressively undergo `` quantum freezing '' , and both mechanics and thermodynamics deviate from classical .",
    "unfortunately there is at the moment no available route to include appropriately these quantum effects in dynamical and frictional simulations .",
    "each core of a present - day cpu executes @xmath144 floating - point operations per second ( flops ) .",

    "approximately linear scaling can be achieved up to @xmath145 cores , thus a md simulation can execute @xmath146 flops routinely .",

    "clearly , speed scales down for more refined force fields , and for larger systems size , although this increase may be mitigated by a larger - scale parallelization .",
    "we can compare these estimates with typical sizes , duration , and speeds in frictional experiments . in macroscopic tribology experiments ,",
    "sliding speeds often range in the @xmath153  m / s region : each microsecond the slider would progress by @xmath154 to @xmath155 m , namely @xmath156 lattice spacings of standard crystalline surfaces . in such conditions",
    "@xmath157s may suffice to generate a good statistics of atomic - scale events , although it may still be insufficient to address e.g.  the diffusion of wear particles or additives in the interface , or phenomena associated to surface steps and/or point defects .",
    "by contrast , in nanoscale afm experiments the tip usually advances at much lower speeds @xmath158 : over a typical run it is possible to simulate a tiny @xmath139  pm displacement , far too small to explore even a single atomic - scale event , let alone averaging over a steady state .",
    "for this reason , in all conditions where long equilibration times and/or slow diffusive phenomena and/or long - distance correlations can be expected , models should be preferred to realistic but expensive md .",
    "however , md simulations can provide so much physical insight that they make sense even if carried out at much higher speeds than in real - life afm or surface force apparatus ( sfa ) experiments : in practice , currently the sliding speeds of most atomistic tribology simulations are in the @xmath159  m / s region",
    ".    here however we should distinguish between static and kinetic friction , and for the latter between smooth - sliding and stick - slip regimes .",
    "smooth kinetic friction generally increases with speed ( velocity strengthening ) , but sometimes decreases with increasing speed in certain intervals . in the former case ,",
    "simulating smooth high - speed frictional sliding is not fundamentally different from the real sliding at low speed , with appropriate changes in frictional forces with @xmath84 .",
    "velocity weakening conditions , alternatively , tend to lead to an intrinsic instability of smooth sliding , which is therefore not often pertinent to real situations .",
    "as a result , for nanoscale systems , md simulations is of value in the description of smooth dry kinetic friction despite the huge velocity gap . on the other hand , static friction  the smallest force needed to set a slider in motion  is also dependent on the simulation time ( a longer wait may lead to depinning when a short wait might not ) , and generally dependent on system size , often increasing with sub - linear scaling with the slider s contact area . to address this kind of behavior in md simulations , it is often necessary to resort to scaling arguments in order to extrapolate the large - area static friction from small - size md simulations @xcite .    returning to the simulation time problem ,",
    "let us come to stick - slip in md simulation , and to the desirability to describe the stick - slip to smooth - sliding transition as a function of parameters such as speed . in afm and sfa experiments , stick - slip and",
    "its associated characteristically high friction and mechanical hysteresis tend to transition into smooth sliding when the speed exceeds @xmath160 m/s ; in contrast , in md modeling the same transition is observed in the @xmath159  m / s region .",
    "this 6-order - of - magnitude discrepancy in speed between experiments and simulations is well known and has been largely discussed @xcite in connection with the effective mass distributions and spring - force constants , that are vastly different , and highly simplified in simulations .",
    "attempts to fill the time and speed gaps can rely on methods , such as hyperdynamics , parallel - replica dynamics , on - the - fly kinetic monte carlo , and temperature - accelerated dynamics which have been developed in the last decades @xcite .",
    "however , caution should generally be exerted in that some of these schemes and methods are meant to accelerate the establishment of equilibrium but not always to treat properly the actual frictional - loss mechanisms .",
    "concerning stick - slip friction , another problem is that , unlike simulations , real experiments contain mesoscale or macroscale component intrinsically involved in the mechanical instabilities of which stick - slip consists . here",
    "the comforting observation is that stick - slip is nearly independent of speed , so that so long as a simulation is long enough to realize a sufficient number of slip events , the results may already be good enough @xcite .",
    "one can even describe stick - slip friction adiabatically , e.g. , from a sequence of totally static calculations , where a periodic back - and - forth sliding path is trodden , the area of hysteresis cycle generated by two different to and from instabilities representing the friction @xcite .",
    "a serious aspect of stick - slip friction which md simulation is unable to attack is ageing .",
    "the slip is a fast event , well described by md , but sticking is a long waiting time , during which the frictional contact settles very slowly .",
    "the longer the sticking time , the larger the static friction force necessary to cause the slip . typically experiments show a logarithmic increase of static friction with time @xcite .",
    "rate and state friction approaches , widely used in geophysics @xcite , describe phenomenologically frictional ageing , but a quantitative microscopic description is still lacking .",
    "mechanisms invoked to account for contact ageing include chemical strengthening at the interface in nanoscale systems @xcite , and plastic creep phenomena in macroscopic systems @xcite .",
    "contact ageing is observed also in other disordered systems out of equilibrium , including glasses and granular matter . in seismology finally , as will be discussed later , it is generally accepted that ageing is responsible for aftershocks , as also shown by some models @xcite .",
    "if md simulation may be satisfactory in nanoscale friction , it is clearly not capable of describing mesoscale and macroscale tribology .",
    "the insurmountable difficulties of the fully atomistic treatment of all typical and large length scales that are responsible for the dynamical processes in large scale systems has prompted in recent years increasing efforts towards multiscale approaches .",
    "the main idea is that , at a sufficient distance from the sliding interface , continuum mechanics should describe all processes to a fair level of approximation .",
    "finite - elements simulations of the continuum mechanics may provide a practical model for the elastic and plastic deformations . using finite element methods , one can increase the coarse - graining level while moving away from the sliding interface , thus keeping the computational effort under control .",
    "several groups @xcite combined the md description of the sliding interface , where local deformations at the atomic length scale and highly nonlinear phenomena occur , with a continuum - mechanics description in the `` bulk '' regions where strains are continuous and small .",
    "the main difficulty faced by this class of approaches is the correct choice of the matching between the atomistic region with the continuum part @xcite . because at the continuum level the detail of lattice vibrations can not be represented in full , the matching conditions",
    "should at least minimize the reflection of the acoustic phonons at the atomistic - continuum interface .",
    "in other words , the matching should allow the transmission of sound deformations in both directions with sufficient accuracy : this is necessary for a proper disposal of the joule heat into the bulk .",
    "simulations can provide direct insight in the dynamical processes at the atomistic level , that are at the origin of friction , allowing a connection of these microscopic facts with their macroscopic counterparts .",
    "case studies , in which the system is well describable by both experimental and theoretical sides , are of extreme importance firstly to permit a crosscheck between the two , and then to make use of simulations in order to highlight particular aspects that can not be accessed by experiments . here",

    "the sliding of rare - gas overlayers deposited on metallic substrates at low temperature has contributed much to the understanding of how friction scales with the contact - area size , the substrate corrugation , and the sliding velocity .",

    "the rare - gas lattice spacing inside the island , generally incommensurate but sometimes commensurate with that of the substrate , plays a very important role in determining the pinning or free sliding that controls the frictional behavior . a generally overlooked aspect which has been highlighted only recently @xcite is the larger thermal expansion coefficient of rare - gas layers than that of a metal substrate , causing a temperature - dependent lattice mismatch at the interface with possible incommensurate - commensurate transitions . due to this mechanism ,",
    "md simulations have predicted the possible appearance of static - friction peaks in the correspondence of a long - range commensurate phase occurring at a particular temperature @xcite . in the case of periodic monolayers ,",

    "simulations of rare - gas incommensurate adsorbates , whose linear substrate - induced misfit dislocations ( `` solitons '' ) must flow during sliding , have revealed the role of their entrance in the depinning of the island @xcite , and of their dissipation through anharmonic coupling to phonons , in kinetic friction @xcite .",
    "finite - size effect are in this case of absolute relevance , effectively generating ( or enhancing ) static friction through a pinning barrier arising at the interface edge , which solitons must overcome to establish motion @xcite .",

    "prior to full squeezeout under pressure , as confirmed by experiments and simulations , the intervening boundary film usually changes from liquid to solid or nearly solid , exhibiting a layered structure prone to develop finite static friction and a high - dissipative stick - slip dynamics in such `` boundary - lubrication '' regime . both sfa measurements @xcite and md investigations @xcite have demonstrated sharp upward jumps of friction at squeezeout transitions where the number of lubricant layers decreases from @xmath50 to @xmath167 .",

    "third , pressure may lead to electronic or magnetic transformations , such as insulator - metal transitions , and this may also in principle influence friction .    _ high plate charging in ionic - liquid lubrication .",
    "_ ionic liquids are salts whose ions have such a large size that @xmath169 falls below room temperature .",
    "experimental data have shown that friction across contacts lubricated by ionic liquids depends on the state of electrical charging of the sliders @xcite .",
    "md simulations applied to heavily simplified ionic liquid models indicate how this dependence can be ascribed to electrically induced structural modifications at the slider - lubricant interface @xcite . for extreme plate charging , these modifications may even modify the lubricant thickness , and also affect its whole molecular structure , with strong predicted consequences on friction @xcite .",
    "on meso- and macro - scales the interface between two bodies is quite generally far from uniform .",
    "when rough surfaces come into dry contact , the actual contacts occur at asperities of different sizes , typically characterized by a fractal distribution . even for a contact of ideally flat surfaces of polycrystal bodies ,",
    "different regions of the interface will be characterized by different local values of the static friction due to structural or orientational domains @xcite . for a lubricated contact , different values of the local static friction may appear due to patches of solidified lubricant or due to capillary bridges .",
    "all these cases can be rationalized with the help of an earthquakelike ( eq ) model first introduced by burridge and knopoff @xcite to describe real earthquakes .",
    "the nature of two problems  earthquakes and friction  is very similar : differences are restricted to their spatial - temporal scales : kilometers and years to millenia in geology compared to nanometers and seconds to hours in tribology .",
    "the eq model , also known as the spring - and - block model or the multi - contact model , has been successfully used in many studies of friction @xcite ; similar schemes have been used also to model the failure of fiber bundles and faults @xcite .    in eq models ,",
    "two corrugated surfaces make contact only at a discrete set of points , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ earthquakemodel ] .",
    "when the slider moves , a single point contact elongates elastically as a spring , as long as the local shear force @xmath171 ( @xmath172 is the contact stretching and @xmath173 is its elastic constant ) remains below a threshold value @xmath174 ; then the contact breaks and slips for some distance , as indeed was observed in tip - based microscopy experiments as well as in md simulations . then , either immediately or after some delay time , the contact is reformed again with zero or lower stretching and a new threshold value .",
    "the simplified version of the eq model assumes that all contacts have the same threshold @xmath175 ; such a model however corresponds to a singular case and may lead to unphysical results @xcite . in a real situation",
    ", the contacts always have different thresholds with a continuous distribution @xmath176 of their static threshold elongations .",
    "therefore , when the upper block begins to advance , the forces acting locally on each contact increase : at successive moments , the contacts begin to snap in a sequence : weaker contacts break earlier , while the strongest contact resists to the last .",
    "eq - like models are usually studied by simulation .",
    "nonetheless , the kinetics of the eq model can be described by a master equation ( me ) , occasionally known as boltzmann equation or kinetic equation . in concrete , indicate the distribution of contact s stretchings @xmath177 by @xmath178 , when the sliding plate reaches position @xmath179 ( see fig .",
    "[ earthquakemodel ] ) : the evolution of @xmath178 is described by the equation @xcite @xmath180 q(x ; x ) = \\delta ( x ) \\ ,    \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } d\\xi \\ , p(\\xi ) \\ , q(\\xi ; x ) \\ , , \\label{int - eq02}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 is the fraction of contacts which break at stretching @xmath177 as a consequence of the plate advancing by @xmath182 .",
    "the `` rate '' @xmath183 and the distribution of the breaking thresholds @xmath184 are connected by the relation @xmath185 indicating that the fraction of contacts which snap when @xmath179 increases by @xmath182 equals those that have their thresholds between @xmath177 and @xmath186 , divided by the total fraction @xmath187 of contacts still unbroken at stretching @xmath177 .",
    "the eq model can be extended to account for thermal effects as well as the ageing of contacts @xcite ; the latter requires an additional equation to describe the increase of threshold values with the time of stationary contact .",
    "analytic solutions of the me are available and , in the smooth - sliding regime , they provide us with the velocity and temperature dependence of the kinetic friction force @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "contrary to the amontons ",
    "coulomb laws , which state that ( macroscopic ) friction is independent of velocity , the friction force in the eq model depends on the sliding speed . at small",
    "driving velocity @xmath133 increases linearly with speed , @xmath188 . indeed , if the slider moves slowly enough , thermal fluctuations will soon or later break all the contacts",
    "the slower the slider the longer time any contact will be given to undergo a fluctuation exceeding its respective threshold ; therefore the smaller the resulting kinetic friction force is .",
    "this linear @xmath189 dependence could be represented as a ( characteristically large ) effective viscosity @xmath190 of a ultrathin lubricant film @xcite . at high driving velocities",
    "the friction force exhibits the opposite behavior , it decreases when @xmath84 grows , @xmath191 , due to relaxation , which one can also call an ageing effect . after snapping",
    ", a contact slips for a short time , then it stops and is reformed again , growing in size and strength .",
    "the faster the slider moves , the shorter time the contacts are left to be reformed and to grow .",
    "overall therefore , the kinetic friction force @xmath192 increases with @xmath84 at low @xmath84 , up to a maximum at @xmath193 and then decreases . at very high velocities",
    "@xmath192 should eventually grow again due to an increased damping in the slider bulk . at intermediate speeds typical of experiments ,",
    "the interplay of thermal and ageing effects generates a weak ( approximately logarithmic ) @xmath189 dependence , approximately consistent with the amontons - coulomb laws , although the proper @xmath189 dependence is rather difficult to detect in experiments @xcite .    on the decreasing ( `` velocity - weakening '' ) branch of the @xmath189 dependence at @xmath194",
    "the slider motion may become unstable and change from smooth sliding to stick - slip motion . if the slider velocity increases due to a fluctuation , the friction force decreases , and the slider accelerates .",
    "this effect is studied usually with the help of phenomenological approach ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a detailed study of the eq model @xcite shows that stick - slip for the multi - contact interface may appear , if and only if two necessary conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , the interface must exhibit an elastic instability .",
    "when the slider moves , the contacts break but then are formed again , but only if the reformed contacts build up a force sufficient to balance the driving force , the motion will be stable .",
    "otherwise the slider will develop an elastic instability , and will keep accelerating until the overall pulling spring force ( of elasticity @xmath53 , see fig .  [ earthquakemodel ] ) decreases enough to regain stability .",
    "second , the contacts must undergo ageing .",
    "once these conditions are satisfied , stick - slip will exists for an interval of driving velocities only , @xmath195 , while for lower ( @xmath196 ) and higher ( @xmath197 ) speeds the motion is smooth @xcite .    the me approach discussed above however assumed a rigid slider which is not a proper model of a realistic extended system . for a nonrigid slider ,",
    "its elasticity produces contact - contact interaction : as soon as a contact fails , the forces on nearby contacts must increase by an amount @xmath198 .",
    "this @xmath199 was shown @xcite to depend on the distance @xmath200 from the failed contact as @xmath201 at short distance @xmath202 , and as @xmath203 at long distance . the crossover length @xmath204 , known as the elastic correlation length @xcite , depends on properties of both the slider ( its young modulus @xmath205 ) and the interface ( the mean separation @xmath206 between nearby contacts and their average rigidity @xmath173 ) .",
    "accordingly , a simpler model can be formulated that considers the slider as rigid across regions of lateral size @xmath207 , with the micro - contacts inside each @xmath208-sized area treated as a single effective macro - contact . for this `` @xmath208-contact ''",
    "the parameters can be evaluated by solving a specific me .",
    "numerics also showed , in addition , that a large fraction of the extra inter - contact force concentrates behind and in front of the snapped contact , implying that effectively the interface can be treated as a one - dimensional chain of @xmath208-contacts , at least approximately .",
    "now , if a @xmath208-contact undergoes elastic instability , namely if at a certain threshold stress the @xmath208-contact snaps and then advances , then the surrounding @xmath208-contacts acquire an extra chance to also fail : this mechanism results in a sequence of snaps propagating forward and backward along the interface as in a domino effect .",
    "the resulting dynamics of the chain of @xmath208-contacts could then be described by the frenkel - kontorova model of sec .",
    "[ fk : sec ] above , but replacing the sinusoidal substrate potential with a sawtooth profile , i.e.  a periodically - repeated array of inclined lines @xcite .",
    "this approach allows one to calculate the maximum and minimum shear stress for the propagation of this self - healing crack ( the minimum shear stress coincides with the griffith threshold @xcite ) , and also the dependence of the crack velocity on the applied stress .",
    "when a @xmath208- sized contact fails at some point along the chain subject to a uniform shear stress , two self - healing cracks leave the initial snapping contact , propagating in opposite directions as divergent solitons similar to the kink - antikink pair of fig .",
    "[ kinks ] , until these cracks either reach the boundary or meet another crack generated elsewhere .    on the other hand , nonuniform shear stress is relevant for experiments such as those carried out by fineberg s group @xcite with the slider pushed at its trailing edge : at this location the shear stress is maximum and across the block it decreases with the distance from the trailing edge . in this system ,",
    "the leftmost @xmath208-contact is the most likely to fail first , as the pushing force is increased .",
    "this failure will result in an increased stress concentrating on the successive @xmath208-contact , which will fail as well .",
    "this process will repeat itself until a self - consistent stress remains below the breaking threshold everywhere in the slider . as a result , the self - healing crack initiated at the trailing edge",
    "will propagate along the interface for a certain distance @xmath209 ( that can be calculated @xcite ) , releasing the stress at its tail side , while accumulating extra stress at its forward side .",
    "when the pushing force further increases , a second crack starts at the trailing edge , and can trigger a failure sequence in the pre - formed stressed state , thus propagating to some extra distance .",
    "these multiple cracks repeat themselves until they reach the slider leading edge , resulting in a major collective slip .",
    "thus , at the sliding onset , several cracks advance along the interface , with the whole slider undergoing multiple small forward slips ( the so - called precursors ) . in experiment these precursors could be detected and could help predicting the eventual large `` earthquake '' @xcite .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning of this section , the eq model was formulated initially to explain earthquakes .",
    "actual earthquakes follow two approximate empirical laws : the one named after gutenberg - richter @xcite states that the number of earthquakes with the magnitude @xmath210 scales with the corresponding magnitudes according to a power law ; the omori law @xcite states that aftershocks occur with a frequency decreasing roughly with the inverse time after the main shock .",
    "eq - like models discussed above can provide a rationale for both these laws of seismology .",
    "specifically , the gutenberg - richter law can be understood as a direct consequence of contact ageing @xcite ; the omori law can be interpreted in terms of cracks propagating to a finite distance  after a major earthquake , the stress is not released in full : a certain amount of stress remains stored at a distance @xmath211 from the main shock @xcite , where an aftershock is likely to occur some time later .",
    "the fascinating and multidisciplinary topic of microscopic friction , where physics , engineering , chemistry and materials science meet to study the process of converting mechanical energy irreversibly into heat , still lacks fundamental understanding , and increasingly calls for well - designed experiments and simulations carried out at well - characterized interfaces .",
    "although afm , sfa , and qcm setups are providing insight in the high nonlinear out - of - equilibrium interface processes at the small length scales , these advanced experimental techniques still provide averaged tribological data .",
    "overall physical quantities , such as the average static and kinetic friction , the mean velocity and slip times , do not allow to tackle easily the problem of relating the mesoscopic frictional response of a driven system to the detailed microscopic dynamics and structural rearrangements occurring at the confined interface under shear .    in this respect , by explicitly following and analyzing the dynamics of all degrees of freedom at play in controlled numerical `` experiments '' with interface geometry , sliding conditions , and interparticle interactions can be tuned ,",
    "mathematical modeling and computer simulations have proven remarkably useful in the investigation of tribologic processes at the atomic scale and are likely to extend their role in future frictional studies .    even though a large number of open questions remains to be addressed",
    ", these modeling frameworks have provided effective insight in the nonlinear microscopic mechanisms underlying the complex nature of static and kinetic friction , the role of metastability , of crystalline incommensurability , and of the interface geometry .",
    "each theoretical approach , from simplified descriptions , to extended realistic md and hybrid multiscale simulations , has limitations and strengths , with specific abilities to address specific aspects of the physical problem under consideration .",
    "thus , a robust prior understanding of the theoretical background is a basic first step in deciding which modeling features deserve a specific attention and which ones are rather irrelevant details , and then in selecting the best methodological approach for a given problem .    concluding , it is worth recalling that novel experimental approaches address the intrinsic tribological difficulties of dealing with a buried interface with a very limited control of the physical parameters of the frictional system : artificial systems consisting in optically trapped charged particles , either cold ions in empty space or colloidal particles in a fluid solvent , forced to slide over a laser - generated periodic potential profile .",
    "indeed , especially in 2d colloid sliding it is possible to follow each particle in real time , like in md simulations . by knowing and , on top of that , tuning the properties of a sliding interface",
    ", our physical understanding can expand significantly and open up possibilities to control friction in nano- and micro - sized systems and devices , with serious possibilities of bridging between nanoscale and mesoscale sizes and phenomena .",
