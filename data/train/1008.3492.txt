    "many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) has become the state - of - the - art for excited states in electronic - structure theory.@xcite starting from a density - functional theory ( dft ) calculation , the @xmath2 method@xcite and its combination with the bethe - salpeter equation@xcite ( bse ) allow to investigate the spectra of electrons , holes , and correlated electron - hole pairs .",
    "the great success of mbpt is based on the systematic incorporation of coulomb interaction and polarization effects on all length scales , which is not considered in most other electronic - structure approaches .",
    "the significant computational cost of mbpt , however , still constitutes a major obstacle for the widespread use of the method .",
    "this holds in particular for larger - scale systems , like defects , hybrid systems , adsorbates , nanostructures , and others . in this paper",
    "we propose a dramatic reduction of the computational requirements of mbpt . as a result ,",
    "the excellent precision of standard @xmath2 and @xmath2+bse calculations is slightly reduced , but instead the treatment of much larger systems becomes possible , thus allowing the investigation of spectroscopic features that might be inaccessible otherwise .    as key ingredient",
    "we exploit the observation that for many systems mbpt , when carried out by ( wrongly ) assuming _ metallic dielectric screening _ , approximately reproduces the band structure of the underlying dft calculation ( when employing the local - density approximation , lda ) .",
    "this had already been observed by wang and pickett,@xcite as well as , by gygi , baldereschi , and fiorentini @xcite and was subsequently exploited for model qp calculations for various materials.@xcite as illustration , fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] shows quasiparticle ( qp ) corrections for silicon ( si ) and solid argon ( ar ) .    the open circles ( @xmath3 ) result from a conventional @xmath2 calculation ( with standard rpa dielectric screening ,  @xmath2/rpa  ) , yielding the well - known opening of the band gap ( by 0.7 ev for si and 6.1 ev for ar ) .",
    "the squares ( @xmath4 ) , on the other hand , come from @xmath2 calculations which employ _ metallic _ screening ; these qp shifts are close to zero ( at least for states near the fermi level ) .",

    "dielectric screening is simulated by a dielectric model function.@xcite here we use a model based on that of bechstedt , enderlein and wischnewski,@xcite slightly modified ( see sec .",

    "such models are controlled by a few parameters , most importantly by the macroscopic dielectric constant , @xmath5 .",
    "setting @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 turns the screening into that of a metal .",
    "if the @xmath2 method with metallic screening , @xmath8 , reproduces the dft - lda band structure , one can arrive at the true qp band structure by adding a self energy @xmath9 to the dft - lda hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "this procedure , which we label ",
    "lda+@xmath10  throughout the paper ( see below for details ) , yields the filled circles ( @xmath11 ) in fig .",

    "these data agree fairly well with the @xmath2/rpa data , at least in the important region near the fundamental gap ; as a rule of thumb , we find that the gaps from @xmath12 agree with experiment to about 10 % , which largely corrects the dft - lda band - gap error of 30 - 50 % .",
    "most importantly , long - range polarization effects are included , which is completely missing from the short - sighted dft - lda .",
    "this systematic improvement due to @xmath13 is much more important than plain agreement of band - structure data with experiment .    while eq .",
    "( [ eq_0 ] ) describes single - particle states of electrons and holes , a straight - forward extension to coupled electron - hole pairs and their optical response is easily possible by calculating the electron - hole interaction ( from @xmath14 ) and solving the bethe - salpeter equation , bse.@xcite since the self - energy considered in this work is in principle still the one resulting from the @xmath2 approximation ( gwa ) , the corresponding approximations to the electron - hole interaction are meaningful in the context of lda+@xmath10 , as well .    as an important consequence of the above findings , the calculation of @xmath2-like band structures via @xmath13 allows for a tremendous gain in numerical efficiency in four respects : ( _ i _ ) the use of model dielectric functions , ( _ ii _ ) small basis - set requirement , ( _ iii _ ) small band - summation requirement , and ( _ iv _ ) weak influence of dynamical effects .",
    "the underlying reason for all four issues is that the current approach calculates qp corrections to dft - lda as a _",
    "perturbation_. most other @xmath2 implementations simply replace @xmath15 by @xmath16 , both of which are in the order of magnitude of 10 ev or more . in order to get their difference to within 0.1 ev , the @xmath2 calculation must be carried out with numerical precision better than 1 % .",
    "our present approach , on the other hand , starts direcly at the qp _ correction _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath13 ) , which is much smaller in magnitude ( @xmath171 ev ) and much more robust . here",
    "it is fully sufficient to evaluate all quantities to within 10 % , only , to achieve the same final numerical accuracy in the band structure .",

    "ab - initio quasiparticle ( qp ) band structures result from the electron self - energy operator @xmath18 .",
    "the state - of - the - art approach to @xmath19 is given by hedin s",
    "@xmath2 approximation,@xcite which is usually evaluated and employed on top of an underlying density - functional theory ( dft ) calculation .",
    "the typical procedure employs dft data to generate the single - particle green function @xmath20 and the screened interaction @xmath14 ( usually within the random - phase approximation ) .",
    "thereafter , the resulting self - energy operator @xmath21 replaces the dft exchange - correlation potential , @xmath15 , arriving at a qp hamiltonian of @xmath22 this procedure is commonly labelled  many - body perturbation theory  ( mbpt ) .",
    "however , this does _ not _ mean that eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) would be evaluated truly perturbatively in the sense that the smallness of the difference ( @xmath23 ) would be exploited . instead",
    ", both terms , @xmath24 and @xmath15 , are evaluated separately , taking their difference afterwards .",
    "the qp corrections are thus obtained as ( small ) differences between two ( rather large ) quantities , both of which have to be evaluated independently and with high precision .",
    "simply speaking , in order to get their difference ( often @xmath171 ev ) to within 0.1 ev ( which is the accuracy expected from mbpt ) , both @xmath24 and @xmath15 ( being of the order of @xmath17 @xmath2510 ev or more ) need to be evaluated with a precision of 1% . the underlying reason for this problem is the quite different conceptual origin of the two terms , which makes it difficult to formulate their difference in analytic terms.@xcite    fortunately , there does exist some pragmatic link between @xmath19 and @xmath15 : the self energy of the homogeneous electron gas ( as a function of the energy of a given state ) is nearly constant ( see ref . ) and thus nearly coincides with @xmath15 .",
    "[ note that this might not be truly fulfilled by approximations to @xmath19 , like the gwa , which might suffer from offsets . ] this behavior is reflected by the observation that in bulk metals , qp corrections ( from gwa ) to dft - lda band structures are very small.@xcite in other words , dft ( at least within the local - density approximation , lda ) does contain correct spectral properties of the quasiparticles , at least for homogeneous systems . within lda , however , these spectral properties are by construction still those of the metallic system ( jellium ) from which the lda exchange - correlation data originate , and this metallic behavior ( in particular , metallic screening ) is a built - in property of the exchange - correlation potential , even when applied to non - metallic systems .",
    "a generalization of this statement would imply that @xmath26 ( provided that @xmath24 is a good approximation to @xmath19 ) with the appropriate @xmath8 ( i.e. metallic screening ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath2 studies employing metallic screening ( including ours , see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) confirm that @xmath27 for most electronic states @xmath28 .",
    "based on the working hypothesis that for non - homogeneous , non - metallic systems the largest difference to metallic behavior is the difference in _ screening _ , and employing @xmath26 , one arrives at the qp hamiltonian @xmath29 in which @xmath30 acts as a self energy , yielding qp corrections ( cf .",
    "( [ eq_0 ] ) ) .",
    "the most important change to eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) is the fact that eq . ( [ eq_2 ] )",
    "no longer evaluates the difference between the self energies ( given by @xmath24 and @xmath15 ) , but the difference in screening : ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this difference is much simpler and faster to treat than the difference between self energies .",
    "note that on the other hand , the final accuracy of the qp band structure might be less than 0.1 ev because the entire approach , although being much more efficient from a numerical point of view , is based on the assumption that @xmath26 , meaning a further approximation in addition to the @xmath2 approximation .",
    "the assumption that @xmath26 should be checked carefully for each system class .    as discussed below , the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) allows for several numerical simplifications ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec_numerics ] ) , leading to a higher efficiency than conventional @xmath2 calculations , allowing to tackle more complex systems .",
    "one of the most important facilitations is the use of model dielectric functions ( see next section ) instead of calculating the screening within the random - phase approximation .",
    "the calculation of the dielectric function within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , which is the common procedure within mbpt , is one of the bottlenecks of the method .",
    "a simplified evaluation of the dielectric function is an important contribution to improving the efficiency of mbpt ( even without the considerations of the previous section ) .",
    "for this reason model dielectric functions are sometimes employed to avoid the rpa.@xcite in the present context , the use of models is also mandatory for another reason : the key ingredient of the present theory is the difference between the correct screening of the ( non - metallic ) system and its ( hypothetical ) metallic counterpart .",
    "this is only useful and well - defined if both types of screening result from the same approach , allowing to tune the screening from  correct  to  metallic  in a seamless manner .",
    "it is , however , unclear how the rpa could be used to simulate metallic behavior of a non - metallic system .",
    "an appropriate model is therefore a necessity of the current approach .",
    "examples are the models proposed by bechstedt , enderlein , wischnewski , and falter and by levine , hybertsen and louie.@xcite we have tested these models in the present context and find that they yield essentially the same results as the ones to be discussed below . in their original form , however , these models have one significant disadvantage which may hinder their application to more complex systems : they were formulated for systems that are characterized by one common dielectric constant without spatial variation .",
    "this makes it difficult to employ them for systems in which the screening shows spatial variation , like interfaces , molecules , etc .",
    "instead we propose a model that is based on a combination of localized and delocalized quantities .",
    "the system may consist of @xmath32 atoms ( at positions @xmath33 ) in a ( periodically repeated ) unit cell or supercell of volume @xmath34 , with reciprocal lattice vectors * g*. to each atom we attribute a static charge - density response @xmath35 ( see below ) and an effective volume @xmath36 .",
    "the dielectric function of the whole system is then obtained as @xmath37 the volume attributed to each atom controls the weight which the atom contributes to the response .",
    "the transformation from the charge - density response to the dielectric function further involves a convolution with the coulomb interaction , i.e. the multiplication by @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_3 ] ) .",
    "note that we work with a symmetrised dielectric function.@xcite    it was suggested by bechstedt _",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) is related to the lindhard dielectric function . in combination with eq .",
    "( [ eq_3 ] ) ( for homogeneous systems , disregarding the summation over atoms ) , @xmath43=@xmath44 would describe the dielectric function .",
    "in particular , for @xmath45@xmath460 one would correctly obtain @xmath47@xmath46@xmath5 ( if @xmath5@xmath48@xmath7 , i.e. for non - metals ) or @xmath49 ( if @xmath5=@xmath7 , i.e. for metals ) , respectively .",
    "the generalization to _ non_-homogeneous systems is less clear .",
    "while the large-@xmath45 behavior , which reflects the short - range reaction of electronic charge to external fields on the sub - atomic length scale , appears realistic for non - homogeneous systems as well , the realistic incorporation of atomic - length - scale charge - density variation and of local fields ( i.e. off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath50 ) is less clear .",
    "here we propose to model the charge - density response attributed to each atom by : @xmath51 in both cases , the factor @xmath52 is a reasonable average of the large-@xmath45 behavior in directions @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the phase factor for each atom results from the position of the atom within the unit cell or supercell .",

    ", this means that the charge - density response is neither perfectly local ( i.e. , exactly at @xmath33 ) nor completely delocalized ( except for a truly homogeneously system , to be characterized by @xmath60 ) .",
    "instead , the charge - density response of an atom originates from its charge density ( or at least from that of the polarizable electronic states ) , and its spatial form is included in the model .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath61 approximates the radius of the atom .",
    "it should be noted that the term @xmath55 \\cdot      \\exp[i({\\bf g}'-{\\bf g}){{\\boldmath\\mbox{$\\tau$}}}_j]$ ] corresponds to the factor @xmath62 ( i.e. , fourier transform of the charge density ) in the model by bechstedt _ et al._@xcite in our model the charge density of the entire system is approximated by a composition of atomic contributions with simplified shape .    a particular role",
    "is played by the factors @xmath63 ( for metallic response ) and @xmath64 ( for non - metallic response ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "these factors reflect the qualitatively different origin of the response of metallic and non - metallic systems . for metals , long - range charge fluctuations and displacements",
    "are possible , resulting from intraband transitions near the fermi level .",
    "such displacements lead to charge accumulation at some atoms and charge depletion at others . here",
    "our model assumes that such charge accumulation or depletion would basically show the same spatial structure as the original charge density of the atom ( modeled by @xmath65 $ ] ) , i.e. @xmath66 .    the charge - density response of a non - metal , on the other hand , is of completely different origin . here",
    "the response to an external field is mainly given by a short - range displacement of charge density from one side of the atom to the other , i.e. by a polarization of the atom .",
    "in many cases , this polarizability is dominated by transitions from @xmath67 orbitals to @xmath68 orbitals or vice versa .",
    "the spatial structure of such @xmath67@xmath69@xmath68 polarizability is given by a factor @xmath70@xmath25@xmath71@xmath25@xmath72 , leading to a factor of @xmath64 in reciprocal space .",
    "again , the additional factor @xmath65 $ ] ( or its reciprocal - space counterpart ) reflects the fact that the response comes from the whole atom ( including some spatial extent ) rather than from a single point .",
    "the model can also be generalized to the case of anisotropic response , e.g. if an atom is embedded in a non - isotropic chemical environment , like in molecules , at surfaces , in @xmath73-bonded carbon , in atomic monolayers on a substrate , or similar .",
    "the same holds for materials with an anisotropic dielectric - constant tensor . in both cases ,",
    "the response of each atom should be modeled with a direction - dependent dielectric - constant parameter @xmath74 . since",
    "such a situation can be expressed in terms of the three principal axes @xmath75 and corresponding principal values @xmath76 of a 3@xmath03 tensor ( see next section for details ) , a straight - forward generalization of eq .",

    "this is particularly relevant for adsorbates on metallic substrates , for metal - insulator interfaces etc . here",
    "our model simply allows to attribute metallic parameters ( i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ) to some atoms and non - metallic parameters ( i.e. , eqs . ( [ eq6 ] ) or ( [ eq7 ] ) ) to others . for the construction of @xmath8 , finally , we simply take metallic response of all atoms ( i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ) .",
    "apparently , for metals ( or metallic regions ) the dielectric function is the same in both cases .",
    "the determination of the parameters is a particular task .",
    "fortunately , the final use of the model for _ differences _ between metallic and non - metallic screening makes the entire approach insensitive to the actual choice of the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath78 , and @xmath57 . within this work ,",
    "we simply attribute a realistic volume to each atom ( for silicon , e.g. , we choose @xmath36 = 20 @xmath79 , which is the volume per atom of bulk si ) , as well as a realistic valence electron number ( for silicon , apparently @xmath80=4 ) .",
    "the average electron density @xmath81 defines the thomas - fermi wave number @xmath82 and plasma frequency @xmath83 for this atom , to be used in @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is obtained from least - square fitting of the atomic charge density by a gaussian function .",
    "these parameters are used for both the metallic and the non - metallic response of atom @xmath56 .    for non - metals one",
    "needs the dielectric - constant parameter @xmath85 ( or the principal axes and values of the corresponding tensor for anisotropic situations ) .",
    "such values can either be taken from experiment , or they are calculated for the particular system .",
    "one possibility is given by the evaluation of the small-*q * limit of @xmath86 from the electrical - dipole operator applied to the interband transitions of the system , leading to a 3@xmath03 tensor of @xmath87 ( @xmath88,@xmath89 = @xmath90,@xmath91,@xmath92 ) from which the principal axes and values can be evaluated .",

    "however , since the resulting @xmath85 enter our model _ before _",
    "the inversion of @xmath93 ( which then leads to the local - field effects ) , the employment of local - field - free parameters is not a problem , but rather a requirement of the model .    in many systems",

    "the two bands are well separated from the silicon bulk states and define the surface band gap . within lda",
    ", this gap suffers from the same type of band - gap underestimation as all semiconductor systems . here",
    "we observe a value of 0.4 ev , much smaller than the experimental result of 0.7 ev from a combination of direct and inverse photoemission ( see tab .",
    "[ tab_1]).@xcite    within @xmath2/rpa , the surface bands are significantly shifted and result in very good agreement with the measured data.@xcite it is most gratifying to see that this behavior is also given by the present lda+@xmath10 approach , which yields a surface gap energy of 0.8 ev .",
    "this good agreement also holds for the absolute energetic position ( with respect to the bulk band structure ) . both for the occupied and for the empty band ,",

    "we find that the charge - density response of the surface atoms is slightly larger than that of the bulk - like atoms in the center of the slab .",
    "the response of the bulk - like atoms agrees with that of a true bulk calculation to within 10 percent . at the surface , on the other hand , the smaller surface band gap , the @xmath105-conjugated nature of the pandey chain , and the vicinity of the vacuum lead to an anisotropic response .",
    "perpendicular to the surface , the response is reduced by about 25 % ( leading to a dielectric - constant parameter of about @xmath106=9 instead of the bulk value of @xmath85=12 ) .",
    "parallel to the pandey chain , on the other hand , the response is doubled to @xmath107=24 .    as another ,",
    "even more extreme case for silicon in reduced dimension , we discuss the silane molecule ( sih@xmath1).@xcite its electronic structure is dominated by quantum confinement , leading to much larger band gaps and qp corrections than for extended semiconductors .",
    "all relevant data are compiled in tab .",
    "[ tab_2 ] . compared to the lda data , the occupied states ( i.e. the lowest occupied molecular orbital , lomo , and ( three - fold degenerate ) highest occupied molecular orbital , homo ) ,",
    "are lowered in energy by more than 4 ev . here",
    "the current lda+@xmath10 approach reproduces these qp shifts to within about 0.5 ev . the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , on the other hand , is shifted to higher energies by 1.0 ev ( @xmath2/rpa ) or 1.2 ev ( lda+@xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "based on these reliable data for single - particle states , lda+@xmath10 also yields reasonable data for charge - neutral electron - hole excitations ( see tab .",
    "[ tab_2 ] ) . here",
    "we take the lowest - energy singlet and triplet excitation as representative examples . while @xmath2+bse within rpa yields data in excellent agreement with experiment@xcite and with other many - body and quantum - chemical methods,@xcite the data from lda+@xmath10 show slightly lower excitation energies .",
    "the deviations are in the order of 0.5 ev and correspond to the differences in the band - structure energy of the homo state , for which lda+@xmath10 yields a slightly too high value .",
    "nevertheless , in light of the huge qp corrections and very strong electron - hole interaction of about 5 ev in sih@xmath1 , we consider the accuracy of lda+@xmath10 ( i.e. yielding qp shifts and electron - hole binding to within 20 % ) extremely gratifying .",
    "similar to the case of the si(111)-(2@xmath01 ) surface , screening in sih@xmath1 differs significantly from that of bulk silicon .",
    "the much larger gap reduces the charge - density response strongly . our approach of locally evaluating the density - response contribution of each atom yields an isotropic response of the silicon atom to be described by @xmath85=3.75 ( and similar results for the h atoms ) , i.e. weaker than bulk si by a factor of 4 .",
    "such strong reduction for chemically passivated silicon in confined geometries was already found earlier.@xcite    we close this section by mentioning that for both systems , si(111)-(2@xmath01 ) and sih@xmath1 , the underlying reason for the success of the lda+@xmath10 approach is again given by the reproduction of the dft - lda band - structure data when metallic screening is employed in a full @xmath2 calculation .",
    "the corresponding data are included in tab .",
    "[ tab_1 ] and tab .",
    "[ tab_2 ] .",
    "in particular for the si(111)-(2@xmath01 ) surface , this mandatory condition for the applicability of lda+@xmath10 is nearly exactly fulfilled .",
    "for the sih@xmath1 molecule some difference of the order of 0.5 ev are found .",
    "considering the massive deviation of this system from a homogeneous metal , even this agreement to within 0.5 ev is an amazing result .",
    "spatially varying dielectric response is also present in metal - insulator heterostructures . as an example fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] shows the single - particle spectrum of a periodic heterostructure composed of five atomic layers ( 10  ) of aluminium and one atomic layer ( 3  ) of argon , stacked along the al(001 ) direction .",
    "this system combines metallic screening in al with insulating behavior in ar , which has significant consequences on the qp energetics.@xcite here we focus on the local density of states ( ldos ) in the ar monolayer .",
    "the ldos between 12 ev and 6 ev results from the upper valence states of ar ( 3@xmath68 ) , while the ldos above 2 ev comes from the ar conduction bands , with increasing admixture of al states at higher energy .",
    "the ldos inside the ar band gap ( 6 ev to + 2 ev ) results from spill - out of al states into the ar layer .",
    "the most interesting feature is the rather small qp correction of the argon states , which ( in @xmath2/rpa ) amounts to 1.7 ev ( + 0.2 ev ) for the upper valence ( lower conduction ) states , yielding a total correction of 1.9 ev for the fundamental gap of ar . in bulk",
    "ar , on the other hand , the gap - edge states observe qp shifts of 4.1 ev and + 2.0 ev , yielding a gap correction of 6.1 ev ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the presence of metallic screening in the immediate neighborhood significantly weakens the qp shifts due to image - state effects,@xcite both for holes and for electrons ( by about 2 ev each ) .",
    "it is most gratifying to see that in our lda+@xmath10 approach ( again with a plane - wave cutoff of 2 ryd ) , the spatial set - up of the dielectric model function ( cf .",
    "( [ eq_3 ] ) ) reproduces these effects . here",
    "lda+@xmath10 yields qp shifts of 1.8 ev and + 0.2 ev for the band - edge states and a gap correction of + 2.0 ev , compared to the ar bulk data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) of 3.5 ev , + 2.8 ev , and + 6.3 ev . we conclude that the lda+@xmath10 approach is a suitable method for addressing electronic properties of metal - nonmetal junctions .    as a last example for the potential of our method , fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] shows the exciton spectrum of non - crystalline argon . at zero temperature argon forms a periodic face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice , which can easily be treated by mbpt ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_method ] ) , leading to the results as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_bulk ] . for this periodic",
    "solid the exciton yields a sharp line ( except for dynamical broadening effects from self trapping or similar , that are completely neglected here ) .",
    "this changes in the case of non - periodic argon , like in its liquid or amorphous state .",
    "such systems may be described by sufficiently large supercells . at present",
    "we investigate the spectra resulting from a 64-atom cell ( consisting of 4@xmath04@xmath04 fcc unit cells ) and exploit its spectral features from the @xmath108 point of the supercell , only . for the periodic fcc crystal this yields an exciton at 12.01 ev excitation energy ( slightly lower than the value reported in sec .",
    "[ sec_bulk ] , which was obtained from the standard fcc unit cell containing one atom , and 500 * k*-points in the bse ) . within",
    "this configuration ( which is computationally much more demanding than a simple one - atom - fcc calculation and is extremely demanding for the standard @xmath2+bse hamiltonian ) the spectrum of liquids or amorphous systems can be evaluated . at present",
    "we simply consider argon at its solid - state density ( for comparison sake ) , but heated to 300 kelvin ( although this is an unrealistic high temperature for argon at this density ) .",
    "we perform a constant - temperature molecular - dynamics simulation ( using a simple lennard - jones interatomic potential ) , leading to the ar - ar pair - correlation function shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] .",
    "such a simulation is certainly not fully realistic in terms of describing liquid or amorphous systems ; nonetheless it yields structural elements that may very well be present in liquids .",
    "the pair - correlation function clearly exhibits structures beyond harmonic vibrations ( like , e.g. the vanishing of the second - nearest - neighbor peak at 5.3  ) , thus prohibiting a perturbative electron - phonon interaction treatment in the evaluation of the spectrum .",
    "instead , our lda+@xmath10 approach ( averaged over 20 snapshots of the md run ) easily allows to evaluate the spectrum .",
    "the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] clearly demonstrate three important features : ( i ) the exciton line is significantly broadened , ( ii ) the broadening is asymmetric , leading to substantial non - zero amplitude well above the exciton energy , and ( iii ) the maximum of the peak is at lower energy than in the periodic system .",
    "the third feature is related to the fact that in the pair - correlation function , the first maximum also occurs at smaller distance ( 3.4  ) than the fcc nearest - neighbor - distance ( 3.7  ) , which is a consequence of the anharmonicity of the ar - ar interatomic potential .",
    "in summary , we have discussed an extremely efficient modification of standard many - body perturbation theory ( @xmath2 method plus bethe - salpeter equation ) . based on the observation that metallic screening in the @xmath2 method approximately reproduces the dft - lda band structure ( which should be checked for each material ) ,",
    "quasiparticle ( qp ) corrections to dft - lda are obtained in a truly perturbative approach at minimal cost , provided that the dielectric screening can be described by an appropriate model .",
    "the resulting qp band structures and optical spectra ( including electron - hole interaction ) are slightly less accurate than those from conventional @xmath2+bse , but they include all coulomb - interaction effects ( like screening , electron - hole binding etc . ) in a physically correct way , allowing to systematically investigate excitations beyond dft and beyond the computational limits of conventional mbpt .",
