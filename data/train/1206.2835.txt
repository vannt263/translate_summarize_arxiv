    "when unperturbed , sand piles persist forever , demonstrating in plain sight granular media s ability to sustain shear stresses  an ability that is frequently considered the defining property of solids . on the other hand , when tapped , the same pile quickly degrades , to form a layer ( possibly a monolayer ) of grains minimizing the gravitational energy .",
    "this is typical of liquids .",
    "the microscopic reason for this dichotomy is clear : the grains are individually ( and ever so slightly ) deformed if buried in a pile , which is what sustains the shear stress .",
    "when tapped , the grains jiggle and shake , and briefly loose contact with one another .",
    "this is why they get rid of some of their deformation  which shows up , macroscopically , as a gradual lost of the static shear stress and a continual flattening of the pile .",
    "when sand is being sheared at a constant rate , both solid and fluid behavior are operative .",
    "first , the grains are being deformed , increasing the shear stress as any solid would .",
    "second , the same shear rate also provokes some jiggling , just as if the grains were lightly tapped .",
    "this leads to a fluid - like relaxation of the shear stress ",
    "the larger the shear rate , the stronger the jiggling , and the quicker the relaxation .",
    "note the reason why loading and unloading give different responses ( called _ incremental nonlinearity _",
    "@xcite ) : when being loaded , the solid part of granular behavior increases the stress , while the fluid part decreases it . during unloading , both work in the same direction to reduce the stress .",
    "this entangled behavior , we suspect , lies at the heart of the difficulty modeling sand macroscopically .",
    "in addition , there is a  history - dependence \" of granular behavior that , being experimentally obvious but conceptually confused and ill - defined , further perplexes the modeler .",
    "obviously , if sand can be characterized , as do other systems , by a _ complete set of state variables _ , any history - dependence only indicates that the experiments were run at different values of these variables .",
    "this is what we believe happens .",
    "the _ hydrodynamic theory _ is a powerful approach to continuum - mechanical description ( or macroscopic field theory ) , pioneered by landau  @xcite and khalatnikov  @xcite in the context of superfluid helium .",
    "bei considering energy and momentum conservation simultaneously , and combining both with thermodynamic considerations , this approach is capable of cogently deducing , among others , the proper constitutive relation .",
    "hydrodynamics  @xcite has since been successfully employed to account for many condensed systems , including liquid crystals  @xcite , superfluid @xmath0he  @xcite , superconductors  @xcite , macroscopic electro - magnetism  @xcite and ferrofluids  @xcite .",
    "transiently elastic media such as polymers are under active consideration at present  @xcite .",
    "two steps are involved in deriving the theory hydrodynamically , the first specifies the theory s _ structure _ : being a function of the state variables , the energy itself is not independent .",
    "nevertheless , the form of the energy density @xmath1 is left unspecified in this first step , and the differential equations are given in terms of the energy density @xmath2 , its variables and conjugate variables .",
    "[ conjugate variables are the derivatives of the energy with respect to the variables , say temperature @xmath3 and chemical potential @xmath4 for @xmath5 , the entropy and mass density ] . in a continuum theory ,",
    "a number of transport coefficients [ such as the viscosity @xmath6 or the heat diffusion coefficient @xmath7 are needed to parameterize dissipation and entropy production . neither is their functional dependence specified .",
    "a theory is unique and useful , of course , only when its energy and transport coefficients are made specific , in a second step .",
    "this division is sensible , because the first step is systematic , the second is not .",
    "the first starts with clearly spelt - out assumptions based on the basic physics of the system at hand , which is followed by a derivation that is algebraic in nature , and hence rather cogent .",
    "the second step is a fitting process ",
    "one looks for appropriate expressions , by trial and error , for a few scalar functions that , when embedded into the structure of the theory , will yield satisfactory agreement with the many experimental data .",
    "starting from the physics of granular deformation and its depletion by jiggling , we have identified the variables and derived the structure of the equations governing their temporal evolution  @xcite , calling it gsh , for granular solid hydrodynamics .",
    "but our second step is not yet complete , and some proposed functional dependencies are still tentative .",
    "the expression for the energy appears quite satisfactory , but our notion of the transport coefficients is still vague . our final goal is a transparent theory with a healthy mathematical structure that is capable of modeling sand in its full width of behavior , from static stress distribution , via elastoplastic deformation  @xcite , to granular flow property at higher velocities  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we determine the complete set of granular variables starting from the elementary physics of granular deformation and its depletion by jiggling .",
    "if a granular medium is sheared , the grains jiggle , roll and slide , in addition to being deformed .",
    "only the latter leads to a reversible energy storage .",
    "therefore , the strain @xmath8 has two parts , the elastic and plastic one , with the first _ defined _ as the part that changes the energy . hence the energy density",
    "@xmath9 is a function of the elastic strain @xmath10 , which alone we identify as a state variable .",
    "for analogy , think of riding a bike on a snowy path , up a steep slope .",
    "the rotation of the wheel , containing slip and center - of - mass motion , corresponds to the total displacement @xmath11 .",
    "the gravitational energy @xmath12 of the cyclist and his bike depends only on the center - of - mass movement @xmath13 , the  elastic \" or energy - changing portion here . and",
    "the gravitational force on the center of mass is @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , the elastic stress is @xmath15 .",
    "when grains jiggle , granular deformation relax , hence @xmath16 with the usual elastic term @xmath17 , and a relaxation term @xmath18 that accounts for plasticity .",
    "[ note because the total strain obeys @xmath19 , the evolution of the plastic strain @xmath20 is also fixed by eq  ( [ n1 ] ) , and given as @xmath21 . ] to understand how plasticity comes about , consider first the following scenario with @xmath22 constant .",
    "if a granular medium is deformed quickly enough by an external force , leaving little time for relaxation , @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 right after the deformation .",
    "the built - up in elastic energy and stress @xmath26 is maximal .",
    "if released at this point , the system snaps back toward its initial state , as prescribed by momentum conservation , @xmath27 , displaying an elastic , reversible behavior .",
    "but if the system is being held still ( @xmath28 ) long enough , the elastic strain @xmath10 will relax , @xmath29 , while the plastic strain grows accordingly , @xmath30 . when @xmath10 vanishes , elastic energy @xmath9 and stress @xmath26",
    "are also gone , implying @xmath31 .",
    "the system now stays where it is when released , and no longer returns to its original position .",
    "this is what we call plasticity .",
    "however , @xmath32 is not a constant in sand : it grows with the jiggling of the grains ( as the deformation is lost more quickly ) and vanishes if they are at rest . if we quantify the jiggling by the associated kinetic energy , or ( via the gas analogy ) by a granular temperature @xmath33 , we could account for this by assuming @xmath34 .    as discussed above",
    ", a shear rate would jiggle the grains , giving rise to @xmath33 . for a constant rate , an expression of the form",
    "@xmath35 is appropriate [ see eq  ( [ n9 ] ) below ]",
    ". inserting @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 the proportionality coefficient ) into eq  ( [ n1 ] ) , we obtain the rate - independent expression , @xmath38 .",
    "being a function of @xmath10 , the stress @xmath39 therefore obeys the evolution equation , @xmath40 which clearly possesses the structure of hypoplasticity  @xcite , a state - of - the - art engineering model originally adopted because sand is incrementally nonlinear , and responds with different stress increases depending on whether the load is being increased ( @xmath41 ) or decreased ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "it is reassuring to see that the realism of hypoplasticity is based on the elementary physics that granular deformation is depleted if the grains jiggle ; and it is satisfying to realize that the complexity of plastic flows derives from the simplicity of stress relaxation .    under cyclic loading of small amplitudes , because the shear rate is not constant , @xmath33 oscillates and never has time to grow to its stationary value of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the plastic term @xmath44 remains small , and the system s behavior is rather more elastic than rendered by eq  ( [ n2 ] ) .",
    "the complete equation for @xmath10 is in fact somewhat more complex ,   that is typically tiny , of order @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the deviatoric ( or traceless ) part of @xmath10 and @xmath48 .",
    "the modifications are : ( 1 )  the relaxation time for @xmath47 and @xmath49 are different . ( 2 )  a shear rate @xmath50 yields an elastic deformation rate @xmath51 that is smaller by the factor of @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast to strain relaxation @xmath53 that is irreversible , @xmath54 accounts for reversible processes ( such as rolling ) . without relaxation , elastic and total strain are always proportional , and for say @xmath55 , @xmath10 is a third of @xmath56 .",
    "circumstances are then reversible and quite analogous to a solid  aside from the fact that one needs to move three times as far to achieve the same deformation .",
    "so the physics accounted for by @xmath54 is akin to that of a lever .",
    "[ this is also the reason why the stress , or counter - force , is smaller by the same factor , see  eq([n12 ] ) . ]",
    "note since any granular plastic motion such as rolling and slipping , be it reversible or irreversible , become successively improbable when the grains are less and less agitated , we expect @xmath57 implying granular media are fully elastic at vanishing granular temperature .      the energy density @xmath58 of a quiescent newtonian fluid depend on the entropy density @xmath59 and mass density @xmath60 , both per unit volume . defining the temperature and chemical potential as @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    ", we note that they can be computed only if the functional dependence of @xmath58 is given .",
    "the pressure , a prominent quantity in fluid mechanics , is also a conjugate variable , as it is given by @xmath63 at constant @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the specific volume , @xmath66 the energy per unit mass .",
    "again , @xmath67 is given once @xmath58 is .",
    "( note it is not independent from @xmath68 and @xmath69 , since it may be written as @xmath70 . )",
    "the conserved energy @xmath2 depends also on the momentum density @xmath71 , and is generally given as @xmath72 .",
    "so the complete set of variables is given as @xmath5 and @xmath73 , and the hydrodynamic theory of newtonian fluids consists of five evolution equations for them .",
    "being a structure of an actual theory , these equations contain @xmath74 , also @xmath75 .",
    "they are closed only when @xmath76 is specified .   in a small environment around given values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , or equivalently , of @xmath69 and @xmath67 , if these are taken as the independent variables . ]    in continuum - mechanical theories , the entropy @xmath59 is not always given the attention it deserves .",
    "the basic facts underpinning its importance are : the conserved energy @xmath2 is , in equilibrium , equally distributed among all degrees of freedom , macroscopic ones such as @xmath77 , and microscopic ones such as electronic excitations or phonons ( ie , short wave length sound waves ) .",
    "the entropy @xmath59 is the macroscopic degree of freedom that subsumes all microscopic ones ( typically of order @xmath78 ) , and accounts for the energy contained in them . off equilibrium ,",
    "energy is more concentrated in a few degrees of freedom , typically the macroscopic ones . the one - way , irreversible transfer of energy from the macroscopic to the microscopic ones  in fluid mechanics from @xmath77 to @xmath59  is what we call dissipation , and the basic cause for irreversibility .",
    "a proper account of dissipation must consider the variable @xmath59 , its conjugate variable @xmath69 , and the entropy production @xmath79 [ with @xmath80 denoting the rate at which entropy is being increased , see eq  ( [ n5 ] ) ] .",
    "this remains so for systems ( such as granular media ) that typically execute isothermal changes .",
    "the energy density of a solid depends on an additional tensor variable , the elastic strain @xmath81 , which in crystals is very close to the total strain .",
    "the associated conjugate variable @xmath82 is the elastic stress  where linear elasticity , or @xmath83 , represents the simplest case .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory of solids consists of eleven evolution equations , for the variables @xmath84 , which in their structure contain the conjugate variables @xmath85 .    displaying solid and liquid behavior , granular media",
    "have the same variables  in addition to the one that quantifies granular jiggling , for which a scalar should suffice if the motion is sufficiently random .",
    "we call it _ granular entropy _ @xmath86 , and define it to contain all inter - granular degrees of freedom : the stochastic motion of the grains ( in deviation from the smooth , macroscopic velocity ) and the elastic deformation resulting from collisions .",
    "we divide all microscopic degrees of freedom contained in @xmath59 into the   inner- and inter - granular ones , @xmath87 and @xmath86 , with the conjugate variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "equilibrium is established , when both temperatures are equal , and @xmath86 vanishes .",
    "( there are overwhelmingly more inner than inter granular degrees of freedom .",
    "when all degrees have the same amount of energy , there is practically no energy left in @xmath86 . )",
    "the equilibrium conditions are : @xmath90 as zero is the value @xmath86 invariably returns to if unperturbed , it is an energy minimum . expanding the @xmath86-dependent part of the energy @xmath91 , we take",
    ", we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 . ] @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "so the twelve independent variables are : @xmath96 and the hydrodynamic theory consists of evolution equations for them all , of which six are given by eq  ( [ n3 ] ) .",
    "the rest will be given in section  [ gsh ] .",
    "these equations will contain @xmath76 and the conjugate variables : @xmath97 , also the pressure , given as @xmath98 with the derivative taken at constant @xmath99 and @xmath10 . as we shall see in eq  ( [ den11 ] ) , this is the pressure that accounts for the contribution of agitated grains .      finally , some remarks about the special role of the density in granular behavior .",
    "first , it is quite independent of the compression @xmath49 : plastic motion rearranges the packaging and change the density by up to 20% , without any elastic compression .",
    "second , the local density only changes if there is some jiggling and agitation of the grains , @xmath100 .",
    "even when non - uniform , a given density remains forever if the grains are at rest .",
    "so , if a pouring procedure produces a density inhomogeneity , this will persist as long as the system is left unperturbed , providing an explanation for the history dependence of static stress distribution . sometimes , these density inhomogeneities have a preferred direction , say , a density gradient along @xmath101 . with density - dependent elastic coefficients , the system will then mimic fabric anisotropy , displaying a stress - distribution reminiscent of an anisotropic medium  even when it consists of essentially round grains and the applied stress is isotropic .",
    "our working hypothesis , given a preliminary validation in section  [ 3geo ] , is that both effects are covered by density inhomogeneities .",
    "the static stress of a sand pile is calculated there and compared to experiments for two densities , the first uniform and the second with a reduced core density , which we argue is a result of different pouring procedures , being rain - like and funnel - fed , respectively .",
    "this section presents the remaining six evolution equations . they will be explained but not derived ,",
    "see  @xcite for more details and the complete derivation .",
    "the evolution equation for the entropy density @xmath59 is @xmath102 eq  ( [ n5 ] ) is the balance equation for the entropy @xmath59 .",
    "it is ( with @xmath79 unspecified ) quite generally valid , certainly so for newtonian fluids and solids .",
    "the term @xmath103 is the convective one that accounts for the transport of entropy with the local velocity , and @xmath104 is the diffusive term that becomes operative in the presence of a temperature gradient .",
    "@xmath105 is the source term .",
    "it vanishes in equilibrium , and is positive - definite off it , to account for the fact that the conserved energy @xmath2 always goes from the macroscopic degrees of freedom to the microscopic ones , @xmath106 .",
    "the functional dependence of @xmath79 changes with the system . in liquids , @xmath79 is fed by shear and compressional flows , and by temperature gradients  @xcite , as depicted by the first line of eq  ( [ n6 ] ) . in equilibrium , we have @xmath107 ; off it , the quadratic form with positive shear and compressional viscosity , @xmath108 and heat diffusion coefficient , @xmath109 , ensures that the entropy @xmath59 can only increase .",
    "in fact , the terms of the first line are , in an expansion of @xmath79 , the lowest order positive ones that are compatible with isotropy .",
    "the second line of eq  ( [ n6 ] ) , with @xmath110 , displays the additional dissipative mechanisms relevant for granular media .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a finite @xmath111 or @xmath26 , indicating some jiggling or deformation of the grains , will both relax and give rise to entropy production .",
    "since granular stress @xmath26 will not dissipate for @xmath112 , we require @xmath113 for @xmath114 . being part of the total entropy , the granular entropy @xmath86 obeys a rather similar equation , though it needs to account for a two - step irreversibility , @xmath115 , the fact that the energy goes from the macroscopic degrees of freedom to the mesoscopic , inter granular ones of @xmath86 , and from there to the microscopic , inner granular ones of @xmath59 , never backwards , @xmath116 eq  ( [ n7 ] ) has the exact same form as eq  ( [ n5 ] ) , so do the first three terms of @xmath117 . but @xmath117 also has a negative contribution . the three positive ones , with @xmath118 , account for @xmath119 , how shear and compressional flows , and gradients in the granular temperature produce @xmath86 , the jiggling of the grains .",
    "the negative term @xmath120 accounts for @xmath121 , how the jiggling turns into heat .",
    "there is the same term , though with negative sign , in @xmath79 , because the same amount of energy arriving at @xmath59 must have left @xmath86 .",
    "as emphasized , all transport coefficients @xmath122 are functions of the state variables ( which may alternatively be taken as @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) .    in the stationary and uniform limit , for @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    ", macroscopic flows produce the same amount of granular entropy as is leaving , implying @xmath128 this is the relation employed to arrive at eq  ( [ n2 ] ) , showing that hypoplasticity holds in the limit of stationary shear rates . given",
    "a shear rate , part of its energy will turn into @xmath86 , which in turn will leak over to @xmath59 . at the same time , some of the flow s energy will heat up the system directly , with the ratio of the two dissipative channels parameterized by @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in dry sand , @xmath131 are probably negligible und shall be neglected below  though they should be quite a bit larger in sand saturated with water : a macroscopic shear flow of water implies much stronger microscopic ones in the fluid layers between the grains , and the dissipated energy contributes to @xmath79 .    finally , we consider the @xmath111-dependence of @xmath132 . expanding them ,",
    "@xmath133 we shall assume @xmath134 , because    * @xmath117 then stays well defined for @xmath114 , see eq  ( [ n8 ] ) ; * viscosities typically vanish with temperature ; * this fits the bagnold scaling ; * for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , we have from eq  ( [ n9 ] ) , for @xmath137 , @xmath138 this ensures the existence of an elastic regime at vanishing @xmath111 , see section  [ hypo ] .",
    "the three evolution equations left to be specified are conservation laws , for mass , energy and momentum , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the gravitational potential ( on the earth surface , we have @xmath141 , the gravitational constant pointing downwards ) . without specifying the fluxes @xmath142 ,",
    "these equations are always valid , quite independent of the system , and express the simple fact that being locally conserved quantities ( in the absence of gravitation ) , energy , momentum and mass obey continuity equations .",
    "the basic idea of the hydrodynamic theory is to require the structure of the fluxes @xmath143 to be such that , with the temporal derivatives of the variables given by eqs  ( [ n3],[n5],[n7],[n10],[n11 ] ) , the thermodynamic relation @xmath144 is identically satisfied , irrespective of @xmath2 s functional form .",
    "this is a rather confining bit of information , enough to uniquely fix the two fluxes as @xmath145 with @xmath146 given by eq  ( [ n4 ] ) , and @xmath147 being the deviatory ( or traceless ) part of @xmath148 .",
    "( for details of derivation see  @xcite . )",
    "although now specified to fit granular physics as codified in eqs  ( [ n3],[n5],[n7 ] ) , these are still fairly general results , valid irrespective what concrete form @xmath2 assumes .",
    "moreover , they also nicely demonstrate the dependence on the number and types of variables : eliminating @xmath86 , or equivalently , taking @xmath112 , in eqs  ( [ n4],[n10a],[n12 ] ) , one obtains the solid hydrodynamics .  .",
    "] further eliminating @xmath10 by taking @xmath149 leads to the fluid hydrodynamics .    focusing on the plastic motion , the standard approach ( especially the thermodynamic consideration by houlsby and coworkers ,  @xcite ) employs the plastic strain @xmath20 as the independent variable .",
    "although this starts from the same insight about plastic motion , the connection between elastic strain , stress and energy , so similar in solids and granular media , with formulas that hold for both systems , is lost  or at least too well hidden to be useful , see also the discussion in section  [ houl ] .    enforcing a velocity gradient @xmath50 , the rate of work being received by the system is @xmath150{\\rm v}_{ij}+[\\zeta_g { \\rm v}_{\\ell\\ell}{\\rm v}_{\\ell\\ell } + \\eta_gv^*_{ij}v^*_{ij}]$ ] , see eq  ( [ n10a ] ) . of these",
    ", the terms in the first square brackets , being proportional to the velocity and hence odd under time inversion , are reactive ; while those @xmath151 in the second bracket are even and dissipative .",
    "work received via an odd term will leave if its sign is changed by inverting time s direction ; work received via an even term stays , as happens only with dissipative processes .",
    "the reappearance of the same factor @xmath52 as in eq  ( [ n3 ] ) is not an accident , but required by energy conservation .",
    "if the same velocity leads to an elastic deformation that is smaller by @xmath52 , then just as with a lever , the force counteracting this deformation @xmath152 is smaller by the same factor .",
    "this concludes the derivation of the structure of gsh , or granular solid hydrodynamics , given by eqs  ( [ n3],[n4 ] ) , ( [ n5],[n6],[n7],[n8 ] ) and ( [ n10],[n11],[n10a],[n12 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of gsh is two - fold , its clear connection to the elementary granular physics as spelt out in the introduction , and more importantly , the stringency of its structure .",
    "it can not be changed at will to fit experiments , without running into difficulties with general principles .",
    "the only remaining liberty is the choice of the functional dependence for the energy and some transport coefficients . as this implies much less wiggle room than with typical continuum - mechanical models , any agreement with experimental data",

    "the third , @xmath161 of eq  ( [ n4c ] ) , is further specified in section  [ f_2 ] .",
    "it accounts for the inter - granular degrees of freedom , the mesoscaled , strongly fluctuating elastic and kinetic contributions .",
    "given an energy @xmath163 , we can use the stress @xmath164 and @xmath165 to close the stress balance @xmath166 , and determine @xmath167 with appropriate boundary conditions . as this",
    "is done without any knowledge of the plastic strain , we may with some justification call this _ granular elasticity _  @xcite .",
    "the relation @xmath168 remains valid because of the following reasons : in an elastic medium , the stressed state is characterized by a displacement field from a unique reference state , in which the elastic energy vanishes . because there is no plastic deformation @xmath169 , the total displacement is equal to the elastic one .",
    "circumstances appear at first quite different in granular media .",
    "starting from a reference state , a stressed one is produced by the displacement @xmath170 , with typically @xmath171 .",
    "due to sliding and rolling , @xmath169 is highly discontinuous , but @xmath172 remains slowly varying , because the cost in elastic energy would otherwise be prohibitive .",
    "fortunately , @xmath169 is quite irrelevant : we have innumerable reference states , all with vanishing elastic energy and connected to one another by purely plastic deformations . as a result ,",
    "we can , for any given displacement @xmath170 , switch to the reference state that is separated from the original one by @xmath169 , and to the stressed one by @xmath172 .",
    "now , the circumstances are completely analogous to that of an elastic medium .",
    "an important aspect of granular behavior , in the space spanned by the variables , is the existence of yield surfaces .",
    "we take them to be the divide between two regions , one in which stable elastic solutions are possible , the other in which they are not  so the system must flow and can not come to rest . a natural and efficient way to account for yield is to code it into the energy , a scalar .",
    "given the stress balance , the energy is extremal  @xcite  minimal if convex and maximal if concave . having the energy being convex within the yield surface , and concave beyond it , any elastic solution that is stable within the surface , will be eager to get rid of the excess energy and become unstable against infinitesimal perturbations beyond it .",

    "* silos * for tall silos , the classic approach is given by janssen , who starts from the assumption that the ratio between the horizontal and vertical stress is constant , @xmath203 .",
    "assuming in addition that @xmath204 only depends on @xmath205 , not on @xmath206 , janssen finds the vertical stress @xmath204 saturating exponentially with height  a result well verified by observation .",
    "( he leaves @xmath207 and all three radial components : @xmath208 and @xmath209 undetermined . )",
    "having calculated @xmath204 , one needs the value of @xmath210 to obtain @xmath211 , usually provided by @xmath212 , with @xmath213 the friction angle measured in triaxial tests .",
    "this makes @xmath213 the only bulk material parameter in silo stress distributions .",
    "we shall refer to this as the jaky formula , although it is also attributed to kzdi .",
    "being important for the structural stability of silos , this formula is ( with a safety factor of 1.2 ) part of the construction industry standard , see eg .",
    "din 1055 - 6 , 1987 .",
    "we believe this formula goes well beyond its practical relevance , that it is a key to understanding granular stresses , because it demonstrates the intimate connection between stress distribution and yield , a connection that has not gained the wide attention it deserves .",
    "starting from eq  ( [ den2 ] ) , we calculated  @xcite all six components of the stress tensor , verifying the janssen assumptions to within 1% , and found the janssen constant @xmath210 well rendered by the jaky formula .",
    "* point loads * the stress distribution at the bottom of a granular layer exposed to a point force at its top is calculated  @xcite employing eq  ( [ den2 ] ) , without any fit parameter .",
    "both vertical and oblique point forces were considered , and the results agree well with simulations and experiments using rain - like preparation .",
    "in addition , the stress distribution of a sheared granular layer exposed to the same point force is calculated and again found in agreement with experimental data , see  @xcite for more details and references .",
    "* sand piles * the fact that the pressure distribution below sand piles and wedges , instead of always displaying a single central peak , may sometimes show a dip , has intrigued and fascinated many physicists , prodding them to think more carefully and deeply about sand .",
    "recent experimental investigations established the following connection : a single peak results when the pile is formed by rain - like pouring from a fixed height ; the dip appears when the pile is formed by funneling the grains onto the peak , from a shifting funnel always hovering slightly above the peak .",
    "employing eq  ( [ den2 ] ) to consider the stress distribution in sand wedges , we found the pressure at the bottom of the pile to show a single central peak if a uniform density is assumed .",
    "the peak turns into a pressure dip , if density inhomogeneity , with the center being less compact , is assumed .",
    "the two calculated pressure distributions are remarkably similar to the measured ones , see  @xcite .",
    "the nonuniform density , we believe , is a consequence of pile formation using the hovering funnel : since the funnel is always just above the peak , the grains are placed there with very little kinetic energy , resulting in a center region below the peak that has a low density . those grains that do not find a stable position roll down the slope and gather kinetic energy .",
    "when they crash to a stop at the flanks , they compact the surrounding , achieving a much higher density .      if a granular medium is exposed either to stress changes , or a moving boundary , the grains will flow , displaying both a smooth , macroscopic velocity , @xmath215 , and some stochastic jiggling , @xmath216",
    ". then the following effects will come into play : first , the energy is extended by a @xmath86-dependent contribution , @xmath161 , see eq  ( [ n4c ] ) .",
    "second , the transport coefficients of  eq  ( [ n13 ] ) become finite .",
    "most importantly , third , the relaxation times @xmath217 of eq  ( [ n3 ] ) are no longer infinite , implying the presence of plastic flows .      specifying the expansion coefficient @xmath219 of eq  ( [ n4c ] ) as @xmath220 , we find @xmath221 by employing eq  ( [ n4 ] ) .",
    "the density dependence of the expansion coefficient @xmath219 is chosen such that it reproduces the observed volume - dilating pressure contribution @xmath222 from agitated grains  @xcite .",
    "however , we can not take @xmath223 as it would imply a diverging granular entropy @xmath86 for @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath225 to be positiv but small , where @xmath226 appears appropriate .",
    "( note that with @xmath227 independent of @xmath60 and @xmath228  where",

    "we may choose our parameters such that @xmath111 is small at typical velocities of elasto - plastic deformations , though large enough to cover both limits of eq  ( [ den17 ] ) .",
    "then the first term of eq  ( [ n12 ] ) dominates , because all other terms ( @xmath235 ) are of order @xmath236 .",
    "then we have @xmath237 , with @xmath238 given by eq  ( [ n3 ] ) .",
    "stress relaxation , the culprit producing irreversible plasticity , is a term @xmath239 .",
    "for very slow shear flows and @xmath240 [ first of eq  ( [ den17 ] ) ] , it is quadratically small and negligible .",
    "this is the elastic regime . at somewhat faster shear flows , the relation @xmath241 [ second of eq  ( [ den17 ] ) ] renders @xmath242 rate - independent , giving it the basic structure of hypoplasticity ,",

    ", we found impressively quantitative agreement , see fig  [ fig1a ] .",
    "this is remarkable , because the anisotropy of these figures , determined essentially by @xmath243 , is a calculated quantity : @xmath244 , with @xmath160 given by eq  ( [ den2 ] ) .       versus axial stress @xmath245 , rescaled by @xmath246 .",

    "the associated strain loci and void ratio are : sawtooth - like for ( a ) , coil - like for ( b ) , butterfly - like ( or double - looped ) for ( c ) .",
    "[ the large - amplitude , isobaric plot is quite similar to ( c ) . ] ]    our last example for validation is not a direct comparison of ghd to some experimental data , but rather an examination of what ghd does , unforced and uncrafted , under typical elasto - plastic deformations .",

    "all transport coefficients depend on @xmath33 as specified , but are otherwise constant , independent of stress and density .",
    "also , all variables are taken to be spatially uniform , reducing a set of partial differential equations to ordinary ones in time .",
    "in spite of these major simplifications , the results as rendered in fig  3 display such uncanny realism that it seems obvious gsh has captured some important elements of granular physics .",
    "we consider a test with the stress given as @xmath257numerical solutions were computed for isobaric test with @xmath258 ( ie . @xmath259 constant ) and quasi - isobaric test , with @xmath260 ( ie . @xmath261 constant ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "they are obtained using the dimensionless parameters : @xmath262 , @xmath263 @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 .",

    "the frequency of @xmath282 is @xmath283 , and the phase lag between them is @xmath284 .      finally , we revisit two previous approaches to come to terms with granular behavior , _ granular thermodynamics _ by houlsby et al  @xcite , and _ granular statistical mechanics _ by edwards et al  @xcite",
    ". we shall compare gsh to both assuming at most superficial familiarity with them .",
    "also , we refute some misconceptions that have become unfortunately widespread , especially the one about energy not being conserved in sand  [ _ sic _ ] .",
    "these are at best a nuisance in exchanges with referees ; and at worst actual obstacles in the progress of our coming to grips with granular modeling .",
    "although considerable work and thoughts have gone into applying thermodynamics to granular media and plastic flow , especially from houlsby and collins  @xcite , its basic points are clear and easy to grasp . taking the entropy production as @xmath285 ( where @xmath286 denotes , as before , the plastic strain ) ,",
    "it is obvious that the usual linear onsager force - flux relation , @xmath287 , hence @xmath288 , does not give a rate - independent @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , houlsby , collins and coworkers consider instead @xmath289 a rate - independent expression .",
    "equating it to eq  ( [ c1 ] ) , with @xmath290 , and @xmath291 being the free energy density , one then solves for the plastic strain @xmath286 with a given @xmath291 .",
    "one example gives @xmath292 on a yield surface , characterized by some components of @xmath26 being constant , and @xmath293 off it .",
    "gsh starts with the same @xmath79 , but possesses the additional variable @xmath33 , for which @xmath294 frequently holds , see eq  ( [ n9 ] ) .",
    "the linear onsager force - flux relation @xmath295 therefore suffices to yield an rate - independent @xmath296 .",
    "note eq  ( [ c2 ] ) leads directly to the relaxation term : because @xmath297 , we have @xmath298 , with @xmath299 .",
    "( the last equal sign holds because @xmath300 are all functions of @xmath10 , with @xmath301 as yet unspecified . )    summarizing , without the variable @xmath111 , houlsby and collins needed to go beyond the well - verified and -substantiated procedure of linear onsager force - flux relation to maintain rate - independence , obtaining a plastic flow that is confined to the yield surface . in gsh ,",
    "rate - independence arises naturally within the confines of linear onsager relation , producing a plastic flow that is as realistic as hypoplasticity , and finite also off the yield surface .      generally speaking",
    ", it is important to remember that of all microscopic degrees of freedom , the inner - granular ones are many orders of magnitude more numerous than the inter - granular ones .",
    "it is the former that dominate the entropy and any entropic considerations .",
    "when revisiting granular statistical mechanics , especially the edwards entropy , it is useful to keep this in mind .    taking the entropy",
    "@xmath302 as a function of the energy @xmath303 and volume @xmath304 , or @xmath305 , the authors of  @xcite argue that _ a mechanically stable agglomerate of infinitely rigid grains at rest _ has , irrespective of its volume , vanishing energy , @xmath306 , @xmath307 .",
    "the physics is clear : however we arrange these rigid grains that neither attract nor repel each other , the energy remains zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath308 , or @xmath309 .",
    "the entropy @xmath310 is obtained by counting the number of possibilities to package grains for a given volume , and taking it to be @xmath311 . because a stable agglomerate is stuck in one single configuration , some tapping or similar disturbances are needed to enable the system to explore the phase space .    in gsh , the present theory ,",
    "grains are neither infinitely rigid , nor always at rest , hence the energy contains both an elastic and a @xmath86-dependent contribution .   and @xmath10 do .",
    "then @xmath312 and @xmath313 , see eq  ( [ den3 ] ) , implying @xmath314 . ] and the question is whether granular statistical mechanics is a legitimate limit of gsh .",
    "we are not sure , but a yes answer seems unlikely , as both are conceptually at odds in two points , the first more direct , the second quite fundamental : ( 1 )  because of the hertz - like contact between grains , very little material is being deformed at first , with the compressibility diverging at vanishing compression .",
    "this is a geometric fact independent of how rigid the bulk material is .",
    "infinite rigidity is therefore not a realistic limit for sand . ( 2 )  as emphasized , the number of possibilities to arrange grains for a given volume is vastly overwhelmed by the much more numerous configurations of the inner granular degrees of freedom , especially phonons .",
    "maximal entropy @xmath310 for given energy therefore realistically implies minimal macroscopic energy , such that a maximally possible amount of energy is in @xmath310 ( or heat ) , equally distributed among the inner - granular degrees of freedom .",
    "maximal number of possibilities to package grains for a given volume is a very different criterion .",
    "the essential difference between granular gas and ideal ( atomic or molecular ) gas is that the particles of the first undergo non - elastic , dissipative collisions . as a result",
    ", their kinetic energy is not conserved , and the velocity distribution typically lacks the time to arrive at the equilibrium gaussian form . quantifying the kinetic energy as a granular temperature @xmath33 ,",
    "it is therefore hardly surprising that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , formulated in terms of @xmath33 , is frequently violated .",
    "these are sound results , obtained from a healthy but truncated model that takes the grains as the basic microscopic entity with no heat content . however , some of the further conclusions are deduced forgetting this simplification , rendering them patently absurd .",
    "these , and their _ [ refutation in italic ] _ , are listed below :    * as the energy is not conserved in sand , neither thermodynamics nor the hydrodynamic method are valid . _",
    "[ only the kinetic energy dissipates in granular media , not the total energy .",
    "the latter , including kinetic , elastic and heat contributions , remains conserved  as it is in any other system . and only the conservation of total energy is important for thermo- and hydrodynamics . ]",
    "_ * fdt , along with other general principles either derived from it or in its conceptual vicinity ( such as the onsager reciprocity relation ) are all violated .",
    "_ [ there are two versions of fdt , only the one given in terms of @xmath33 is violated , not the one in terms of the true temperature @xmath69 .",
    "the latter is a general principle and always valid .",
    "for instance , the volume fluctuation is given as @xmath315 , with @xmath291 the associated free energy , for a copper block , a single grain , and a collection of grains .",
    "if the grains in the collection are jiggling , there is an extra contribution @xmath316 in @xmath291 , see eq  ( [ n4c ] ) , that considerably increases the value of @xmath317 .",
    "the onsager relation remains valid because the true fdt holds . ]",
    "_ * the onsager relation is also violated because the microscopic dynamics , the collision of the grains , is dissipative and hence irreversible . _",
