    "the natural generalised lotka - volterra structure of the evolution of the universe constituent densities has enabled us to describe the isotropic and homogenous universe as a generalised predator - prey system .",
    "the effective barotropic indices that emerge from the natural quadratic jungle coupling between cosmological fluids induce various dynamics of the evolution of the scale factor and fluid densities , from limit cycles to possible chaos .",
