    "features observed in the hard x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are one of the most direct probes of the structure of accretion discs close to the central black hole .",
    "the prominent iron k@xmath2 emission line at 6.4  kev  and compton hump at @xmath52030  kev  in the spectra of many seyfert  1 galaxies indicates that optically thick material is being illuminated by the hard x - ray source @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite , if this reflected emission arose from the accretion disc , then relativistic and doppler effects would broaden the emission lines in a characteristic way .",
    "observations of such a line allows a determination of not only the accretion disc structure close to the black hole , but also the space - time geometry in the strong gravity regime .",
    "the _ asca _ observatory ( 19932001 ) finally provided the sensitivity to search for relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath2  lines , and detected a clear example in the spectrum of the bright seyfert  1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15  @xcite .",
    "since that initial discovery , broad fe  k@xmath2lines have been found in many other seyferts @xcite , and are now an integral part of agn phenomenology @xcite .",
    "calculations of the reprocessed emission from an irradiated slab of gas have shown that the fe  k@xmath2  line , by virtue of its large fluorescent yield and relatively high cosmic abundance , is the strongest line in the reflection spectrum @xcite . yet , strong lines from abundant elements such as carbon , nitrogen and oxygen are also present at lower energies , and , if detected , would provide further information on the ionization state of the accretion disc .",
    "models of reflection from photoionized discs have shown that the soft x - ray features are very sensitive to the ionization parameter of the disc material @xcite .",
    "determining the ionization state of the disc would constrain the magnitude of the illuminating radiation , and would therefore place limits on the amount of accretion energy that is released in the corona .    although the soft x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies are complicated by features such as warm absorbers and soft excesses , the sensitivity and resolution provided by the instruments on board _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ could allow relativistic soft x - ray emission lines to be found amongst the clutter and noise .",
    "indeed , claims of such lines from hydrogenic carbon , nitrogen and oxygen have already been made based on _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) spectra of mcg6 - 30 - 15  and mrk  766 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the time is right for a closer look at the properties of the soft x - ray accretion disc lines .    here",
    ", we employ detailed models of photoionized accretion discs to investigate the properties ( specifically , the strength and width ) of the c , n & o lines found in the reflection spectra . a range of ionization parameters are considered , and both constant density slabs and hydrostatic atmospheres are used for the disc structure . the calculations and assumptions are outlined in the following section , with the results presented in section  [ sect : res ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results in light of the recent _ xmm - newton _ observations and draw conclusions in section  [ sect : discuss ] .",
    "models of illuminated accretion discs have greatly increased in sophistication over the last couple of years .",
    "initially , the calculations had assumed that the surface of the disc was a constant density slab @xcite , and so the resulting gas structure and reflection spectrum could be characterized by the ionization parameter @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the x - ray flux incident on the slab , and @xmath8 is the hydrogen number density of the material .",
    "while such a simple structure has some theoretical justification ( a standard optically - thick disc has a roughly constant vertical density profile in the radiation pressure dominated limit ; @xcite ) , the heated surface of the slab was out of pressure equilibrium with the remainder of the material .",
    "recently , more realistic calculations were performed with the surface of the disc required to remain in hydrostatic balance @xcite . under this condition ,",
    "the irradiated gas takes on a more ` two - phase ' structure with an outer hot ( @xmath9 compton temperature ) , ionized layer in pressure balance with a denser , colder and more neutral inner zone .",
    "the spectral features in the reflection spectra depend on the sharpness of the transition between the two layers @xcite , but qualitatively appear to be a diluted version of the constant density models .    in this section , we detail ionized disc calculations made with both the constant density code of @xcite and the hydrostatic code of @xcite . since these latter models are dependent on the unknown accretion disc parameters , this paper concentrates on the results from the constant density models .",
    "however , an example hydrostatic calculation will be shown to illustrate the similarities and differences between the two approaches .",
    "important updates were made to both codes in order to better determine the soft x - ray emission spectrum .",
    "first , more elements were treated , and more recombined ions of each element were included .",
    "this was necessary so that nitrogen lines would be included in the output spectrum and so that the opacity would be treated accurately throughout the soft x - ray portion of the spectrum .",
    "in addition to fully - ionized species , the following ions are included in the calculations : c  iii ",
    "vi , n  iii ",
    "vii , o  iii ",
    "viii , ne  iii  x , mg  iii ",
    "xii , si  iv ",
    "xiv , s  iv  xvi and fe  vi  xxvi .",
    "details of the atomic physics used will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "second , the appropriate fraction of emission - line photons that escape ( in narrow profiles ) directly from the gas without undergoing any further continuum absorption or compton scattering is kept track of separately from the rest of the diffuse radiation originating within the gas @xcite .",
    "finally , the l shell lines of fe  xvii  xxii were changed from 3d@xmath102p transitions to 3s@xmath102p transitions . like the other prominent lines ,",
    "the fe l - lines are produced by recombination .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that recombination cascades favour the production of 3s@xmath102p lines over 3d@xmath102p lines , and this effect is enhanced by resonance trapping of 3d@xmath102p lines in optically thick gas .",
    "we assume that all recombinations to fe  xvii - xxii , except for radiative recombinations directly to the 2p level , ultimately result in 3s@xmath102p emission .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite have shown that , over a wide range of @xmath0 , the ly@xmath2 line of o  viii  is typically the strongest soft x - ray emission line in the reflection spectrum . therefore ,",
    "this is the line that is most likely to be detected by current instruments and so we computed models where it is expected the be at its most prominent .",
    "specifically , reflection spectra were calculated for @xmath11250 , 500 & 1000  erg  cm  s@xmath1 .",
    "the incident spectrum was assumed to be a power - law with photon - index @xmath12 , typical of a seyfert  1 galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a 10  ev blackbody illuminated the base of the slab ( at a thomson depth @xmath13 ) with six times the flux of the power - law .",
    "an example of one of the computed spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .    to investigate the effects of different metal abundances , a set of models",
    "was computed with five times the solar oxygen abundance , and another set with five times the solar nitrogen abundance .",
    "the initial set of abundances was taken from the list of @xcite .",
    "the hydrostatic model requires many input parameters as the height of the disc at the irradiated point has to be explicitly calculated . for generality , we chose values typical of a seyfert  1 galaxy : black hole mass @xmath14  m@xmath15 , accretion rate @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is the eddington accretion rate ) , and the reflection occurs at a disc radius of 7 schwarzschild radii",
    ". radiation - pressure dominated boundary conditions were assumed . as with the constant density models , the surface of the disc was illuminated with a @xmath12 power - law , but with an incident - flux - to - disc - flux ratio @xmath19 .",
    "these parameters resulted in a reflection spectrum similar to the @xmath20  erg  cm  s@xmath1  constant density model ( see sect  [ sub : hydro ] ) and thus isolates the differences due to the different density structures rather than 1 for the hydrostatic model , the added compton cooling decreases the compton temperature and hence the effective ionization parameter of the atmosphere .",
    "the actual differences between these two reflection spectra in the energy range of interest are fairly small , with the most significant change being narrower lines due to the o emission region lying within 0.5 thomson depths of the surface . ] . only a single model with solar abundances",
    "was computed with these parameters .",
    "it is expected that for most seyfert  1s , the x - ray power - law will be observed directly along with the reflection spectrum , so our analysis concentrates on the sum of the incident and reflection spectra ( i.e. , a reflection fraction of one ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : plot9 ] we plot the resulting nine total spectra between 0.3 and 1.2  kev .",
    "the plots show many lines in this region of the spectrum which vary in shape and strength as the parameters are changed : c  vi  ly@xmath2 at 0.37  kev , n  vi  ( resonance+intercombination ) at 0.43  kev  ( usually very weak ) , n  vii  ly@xmath2 at 0.50  kev , o  vii(resonance+intercombination ) at 0.57  kev , o  viii  ly@xmath2 at 0.65  kev , and a cluster of fe l lines ( particularly from fe  xvii  xix ) between @xmath50.7 and 1.0  kev . in table",
    "[ table : data ] the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the most prominent lines are listed for each of the nine models , as well as the width of their blue wings ( wbw ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the reason for these differences is that the more realistic density structure results in a hot scattering layer overlying the line emitting material . in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : hydro ] the vertical temperature profile of the hydrostatic model is overlaid on a plot of the oxygen ionization structure .",
    "we see that the temperature reaches @xmath211  kev  at the surface of the atmosphere , which is nearly an order of magnitude hotter than the surface of the @xmath20  erg  cm  s@xmath1  constant density model .",
    "oxygen is fully stripped until a thomson depth of 0.9 , where , because of the rapidly increasing gas density , it quickly recombines to o  iii , the lowest ionization state that is treated .",
    "most of the o  viii  emission therefore originates from a narrow zone which is not very dense .",
    "thus the o  viii  line is intrinsically weaker in a hydrostatic disc model .",
    "the region in which large fractions of o  vii  viii are produced is so restricted that the o  vii  line is very much weaker in the hydrostatic model than in the constant density models .",
    "therefore , the hydrostatic models predict that only o  viii  is detectable .",
    "the existence of the hot , fully ionized skin on the surface of the disc dilutes the spectral features which are formed underneath by compton scattering the emission lines .",
    "this results in the broad bases seen in figure  [ fig : hydro ] .",
    "although most of the o  viii  emission originates from only a single thomson depth into the atmosphere , the temperature of the ionized skin is such to result in significant dispersion .",
    "an ionized skin at the surface of the atmosphere is a common feature of hydrostatic disc models @xcite .",
    "if the illuminated hydrostatic models are a more realistic description of accretion discs than the constant density ones , then soft x - ray accretion disc lines are expected to be weak and broad features , and will therefore be challenging to detect .",
    "the ultimate goal of x - ray spectroscopy of agn is to learn about accretion flows around supermassive black holes .",
    "detecting soft x - ray emission lines from the accretion disc would complement the information inferred from the fe  k@xmath2  line . in principle",
    "this should be relatively straightforward as the effective area of most x - ray detectors peak in the soft x - ray band , and gratings observations would allow an accurate determination of any warm absorber . unfortunately , the calculations presented in the previous section suggest that most of the emission lines will be quite weak and broad ( even before relativistic blurring ) , and therefore difficult to pull out of the noise with current instruments",
    ". the one exception may be the o  viiily@xmath2 line which has an ew that can approach 100  ev , depending on the density structure of the disc .",
    "if that line could be measured accurately enough then , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot9 ] , it would give a good constraint on the ionization parameter of the disc .",
    "if significant o  vii  emission is also seen then abundance information may also be derived .",
    "although the unambiguous detection of individual lines will likely be a challenge , soft x - ray accretion disc lines have the potential to be important to the study of agn .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite claimed to have detected relativistically blurred c  vi  ly@xmath2 , n  vii  ly@xmath2 and o  viii  ly@xmath2 lines in _ xmm - newton _ rgs observations of the seyfert  1 galaxies mcg6 - 30 - 15  and mrk  766 .",
    "this interpretation was challenged by @xcite who favour a dusty warm absorber model to explain the features seen in their _ chandra _ gratings data of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the predictions of ionized disc models should be able to provide a data - independent view of which interpretation is most probable .",
    "@xcite fitted the ionized disc models of @xcite and @xcite to the _ asca _ data of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , concentrating on the region around the fe  k@xmath2  line .",
    "the resulting best fit models predicted o  viii , o  vii  and fe  l emission with ews @xmath3 20  ev , incompatible with the results of @xcite .",
    "the results presented in sect .  [ sect : res ] enable us to take an orthogonal point of view .",
    "ignoring the fe  k@xmath2  line entirely , we can ask the question : is there a region in the explored parameter space which can account for the putative soft x - ray emission lines ?",
    "the updated analysis of mcg6 - 30 - 15  by @xcite is very specific : they only see emission lines of o  viii , n  vii  and c  vi  with ews of @xmath22  ev , @xmath23  ev and @xmath24  ev , respectively . from table  [",
    "table : data ] it seems that a constant density model with @xmath25  erg  cm  s@xmath1  and an o overabundance could account for the c and o lines , but none of the models can account for the strength of the n line , unless there is also a large ( i.e. , greater than 5 times solar ) overabundance of n. however , these models predict significant o  vii  and fe l emission which is not seen by @xcite , although detectable given the limits placed on the other lines .",
    "the only way to remove these features would be to increase the ionization parameter , but this will weaken and smear out the o  viii  line . of course , it will be even more difficult to obtain the required line strengths with hydrostatic models because the emission features are intrinsically weaker .",
    "our calculations point to another serious problem with the relativistic emission line interpretation .",
    "namely , the blue wing of the putative o  viii  line is very sharp , dropping down at 700  ev to the continuum in @xmath26  ev , as judged from the high resolution _",
    "data where the drop is @xmath33  ev ( fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the line must therefore have a relative width of much less than one per cent .",
    "even a single scattering from an electron at 10@xmath27  k will impart a rms width of 2 per cent to the line , rising to 6 per cent at 10@xmath28  k. a sharp observed feature from a line must therefore be due to the unscattered line core , which usually carries little flux .",
    "the ionized disc models predict a _ minimum _ width of the o  viii  line of over 40  ev ( table  [ table : data ] ) .",
    "relativistic blurring makes the width even larger .",
    "figure  [ fig : blurred ] shows the results of blurring the @xmath25  erg  cm  s@xmath1solar abundance model ( the top - left model from fig .",
    "[ fig : plot9 ] ) with the parameters given by @xcite .    with the relativistic blurring effects , the o  vii  and o",
    "viii  lines are combined together and peaks at 0.6  kev . at 0.7  kev",
    "the blue wing of this blended line falls by only 20 per cent over a range of 50  ev .",
    "this is significantly weaker than the factor of 23 drop over @xmath53  ev seen in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "the 0.7  kev drop is weaker in this reflection model because the fe  l lines have been blurred together and redshifted against the edge of the oxygen lines .",
    "the oxygen lines can be made sharper by moving to lower @xmath0 , but only at the expense of increasing the strength of the o  vii  and fe  l lines .",
    "as before , hydrostatic models make the situation worse because they provide additional compton scattering due to the ionized skin . of course",
    ", these considerations also apply to mrk  766 .",
    "although we have obviously not covered the entire available parameter space , we conclude that it is very difficult , if not impossible , for reflection from ionized discs to produce the lines required by the interpretation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , there does not seem to be a situation where one can obtain strong o  viii , n  viiand c  vi  ly@xmath2 emission without simultaneously having significant o  vii  and fe l lines .",
    "second , in any situation where o  viii  does dominate the emission spectrum , the disc has to be fairly highly ionized and so the lines are compton broadened with widths of 10s of ev .",
    "this width will further increase upon relativistic blurring , and therefore can not possibly have the sharp , @xmath4  ev drop at the high - energy side that the mcg6 - 30 - 15  data requires .",
    "more realistic hydrostatic ionized disc models exacerbate these problems because of the hot ionized skin on the surface of the disc . in general , any soft x - ray relativistic line will tend to create broad weak features in the observed spectrum .",
    "any large sharp drops in this spectral range must be due to absorption edges .",
    "it is likely there are weak broad features due to ionized oxygen in the spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "they are a plausible identification for the soft excess required in spectral modelling of _ chandra _ data by @xcite and for the residuals from a dusty warm absorber fit to _ xmm - newton _",
    "data by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "4 ) . on the basis of our calculations ,",
    "we conclude that the sharp drop seen in all soft x - ray spectra of mcg6 - 30 - 15  at 0.7  kev  can not plausibly be the blue wing of an o  viii  emission line produced by reflection .",
