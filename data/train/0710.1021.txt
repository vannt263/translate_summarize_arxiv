    "glitches are tiny , impulsive , randomly timed increases in the spin frequency @xmath17 of a rotation - powered pulsar , sometimes accompanied by an impulsive change in the frequency derivative @xmath5 .",
    "they are to be distinguished from timing noise , a type of rotational irregularity where pulse arrival times wander continuously , although there is evidence that timing noise is the cumulative result of frequent microglitches in certain pulsars @xcite .    at the time of writing ,",
    "285 glitches in total have been detected in 101 objects ( @xmath18 of the known radio pulsar population ) , the majority in the last four years , facilitated by the parkes multibeam survey , refined multifrequency ephemerides , and better interference rejection algorithms @xcite .",
    "efforts to analyse the data statistically have focused on the correlation of glitch activity with age @xcite and reynolds number @xcite , the post - glitch relaxation time - scale @xcite , the size distribution @xcite , and the correlation between glitch sizes and waiting times @xcite .",
    "@xcite reviewed the role of observational selection effects .",
    "most glitching pulsars ( @xmath19 ) have been seen to glitch once , but a minority glitch repeatedly ; the current record holder is psr j1740@xmath23015 , with 33 glitches . of those objects which glitch repeatedly ,",
    "most do so at unpredictable intervals , but two ( psr j0537@xmath26910 and vela ) are quasiperiodic ; vela , in particular , has been likened to a relaxation oscillator @xcite .",
    "the fractional increase in @xmath17 spans seven decades ( @xmath20 ) across the glitch population and as many as four decades in a single object ( e.g.  @xmath21 in psr j1740@xmath23015 ) .",
    "the spin - down age @xmath22 of glitching pulsars spans four decades , from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . in many respects , therefore ,",
    "the glitch phenomenon is _",
    "scale invariant_. this striking property invites physical interpretation .",
    "theories of pulsar glitches have focused mainly on the local microphysics of the superfluid in the stellar interior and its coupling to the solid crust , for example the strength of vortex pinning @xcite , the rate of vortex creep @xcite , or the conditions for exciting superfluid turbulence @xcite .",
    "ultimately , however , the local microphysics must be synthesized with the global , _ collective _ dynamics in order to make full contact with observational data .",
    "( likewise , a practical model of earthquakes must synthesize the microphysics of rock fracture with the macrodynamics of interacting tectonic plates . ) for example , if approximately @xmath25 vortices unpin from crustal lattice sites in sympathy during a glitch , they must communicate rapidly across distances much greater than their separation .",
    "why does the number that unpin fluctuate so dramatically",
    "( by up to four orders of magnitude ) from glitch to glitch in a single pulsar , while always amounting to a small fraction ( @xmath26 ) of the total ?",
    "such collective , scale invariant behavior is a generic feature of a class of natural and synthetic far - from - equilibrium systems , called self - organized critical systems , that are discrete , interaction dominated , and slowly driven , and that adjust internally via erratic , spatially connected _ avalanches _ of local , impulsive , threshold - activated , relaxation events @xcite .",
    "such systems fluctuate around a stationary state towards which they evolve spontaneously , in which global driving balances local relaxation on average over the long term .",
    "the archetype of a self - organized critical system is the sandpile @xcite .    in this paper , we study pulsar glitches as an avalanche process , as first proposed by @xcite . after reviewing self - organised criticality in  [ sec : gli2 ] , we define the statistical sample on which our study is based (  [ sec : gli3 ] ) and analyze the observed distribution of glitch sizes (  [ sec : gli4 ] ) and waiting times (  [ sec : gli5 ] ) .",
    "some implications for glitch physics are explored in  [ sec : gli6 ] .",
    "we only include radio pulsars in the sample , to preserve its homogeneity , even though glitches have now been observed in anomalous x - ray pulsars ( magnetars ) as well @xcite .",
    "a system in a self - organised critical state exhibits the following distinguishing features @xcite .    1 .",
    "it is composed of many discrete , mutually interacting elements , whose motions are dominated by local ( e.g.  nearest neighbor ) rather than global ( e.g.  mean field ) forces .",
    "each element moves when the local force exceeds a threshold ( stick - slip motion ) .",
    "hence stress accumulates sustainedly at certain random locations while relaxing quickly elsewhere ; at any instant , the system houses numerous metastable stress reservoirs , separated by relaxed zones .",
    "an external force drives the system slowly , in the sense that elements adjust to local forces rapidly compared to the driver time - scale .",
    "combined with local thresholds , this ensures that the system evolves quasistatically through a history - dependent sequence of metastable states ( a huge number of which are available ) .",
    "transitions from one metastable state to the next occur via avalanches : spatially connected chains of local equilibration events , in which one element relaxes and redistributes some local stress to its neighbors , which in turn can exceed their thresholds and relax ( knock - on effect ) .",
    "the duration of even the largest avalanches is short compared to the driving time - scale ( see previous point ) .",
    "avalanches have no preferred scale : they can involve a few ( commonly ) or all ( rarely ) of the elements in the system .",
    "their sizes and lifetimes follow power - law distributions , whose exponents are related .",
    "the numerical values of the exponents depend on the spatial dimensionality of the system , the spatial symmetries of the local forces and redistributive channels , the strength of the local forces @xcite , and the level of conservation @xcite .",
    "6 .   over the long term",
    ", the system tends to a critical state , which is stationary on average but not instantaneously .",
    "for example , on average , the power input by the external driver equals the energy per unit time released by avalanches .",
    "but there are fluctuations , because , at any instant , a random amount of energy is stored in metastable local reservoirs .",
    "avalanche dynamics are generically observed in nature when conditions ( i)(iii ) are met , and properties ( iv)(vi ) emerge irrespective of the detailed microphysics @xcite .",
    "likewise , in this paper , we remain agnostic about the microphysics of pulsar glitches ; the statistical analysis presented below makes no assumptions in this regard .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that the traditional glitch paradigm  collective unpinning of quantized superfluid vortices interacting with an inhomogeneous , slowly decelerating crust  conforms closely with ( i)(vi ) @xcite .",
    "so too does an alternative paradigm , based on crust fracture @xcite , whose terrestrial counterpart ( plate tectonics ) is renowned as an archetype of self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "we elucidate the analogy briefly before continuing .",
    "consider a rectilinear array of quantized vortices , each carrying circulation @xmath27 , spaced evenly according to feynman s rule ( @xmath28 vortices per unit area ) in the neutron superfluid permeating the inner crust of a neutron star .",
    "a small percentage of the vortices are pinned to defects and/or nuclei at random locations in the crustal lattice , clustered to varying degrees @xcite as @xmath17 decreases gradually due to electromagnetic spin down , most vortices move apart and the outermost ones are expelled .",
    "however , the pinned vortices stay ( nearly ) fixed , in metastable reservoirs separated by relaxed zones [ see ( ii ) ] , creeping slowly between adjacent pinning sites in response to thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the reservoirs are identical to the capacitive elements ( vortex traps surrounded by vortex depletion regions ) postulated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they may be seeded by starquakes , which create large numbers of fresh lattice dislocations with deep pinning potentials , or they may emerge spontaneously in the self - organized critical state , as successive generations of vortex avalanches traverse the crust",
    ". as the pinned vortices increasingly lag the regular , unpinned array , a gradient in vortex density is established , and the local magnus force on a pinned vortex rises . when the pinning threshold is overcome , a pinned vortex unpins and moves abruptly away from the pinning site ( stick - slip motion ) , disturbing the local superfluid velocity field ( and hence the magnus force ) appreciably .",
    "often , this is enough to push neighboring , barely subcritical , pinned vortices over their thresholds , triggering an avalanche .",
    "most vortices in the avalanche rejoin the regular , unpinned array , and the crust spins up proportionately to compensate .",
    "the time - scale for a vortex to adjust locally to the magnus and pinning forces is much shorter than @xmath29 , in keeping with ( iii ) .",
    "classic laboratory experiments on magnetic flux vortices in a type ii superconductor ( e.g.  nbti ) immersed in a slowly changing magnetic field , an exactly analogous system , clearly exhibit properties ( iv)(vi ) @xcite .",
    "vortices are expelled mostly in a continuous flow ( cf .",
    "steady spin down ) and occasionally in avalanches ( cf .",
    "glitches ) .",
    "the distribution of avalanche sizes is measured to be a power law over several decades , whose exponent depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field ( which controls the vortex spacing and hence the strength of the vortex - vortex interaction ) .",
    "the temporal fluctuation spectrum scales as an inverse power of frequency at high frequencies .",
    "after initial transients die away , the superconductor fluctuates around a self - organised critical state , called the bean state , where the lorentz force acting on each vortex is everywhere equal to the maximum pinning force .",
    "if the pinning sites are sparsely distributed , so that global ( mean - field ) forces dominate local forces between pinned vortex clusters , scale invariance breaks down @xcite . avalanches still occur , but they are distributed narrowly around a characteristic size and lifetime , involving nearly all the vortices instead of small , independent subsets . in this regime , avalanches recur quasiperiodically , not stochastically .",
    "similar behavior is observed when the external driver acts too rapidly , but this situation never arises in pulsars .",
    "scale invariant avalanche dynamics and self - organised critical states are observed widely elsewhere , in sandpiles @xcite , earthquakes @xcite , solar flares @xcite , and bursts from soft - gamma - ray repeaters @xcite .",
    "the analogy with pulsar glitches has been pointed out by @xcite and @xcite and modeled using a cellular automaton by @xcite .",

    "for some newly discovered glitches , the information is incomplete .",
    "epochs and sizes have been measured for 271 and 250 glitches respectively .",
    "other parameters , like the healing fraction and post - glitch relaxation time - scale , are omitted as they are not analyzed in this paper ; please consult @xcite and references therein for a full catalog .",
    "if pulsar glitches are the result of an avalanche process , their size distribution should be scale invariant in any individual pulsar , with probability density function @xmath37 the exponent @xmath38 is set by the dimensionality and symmetries of the local forces , which are likely to be universal , and the strength and level of conservation of these forces , which are functions of temperature and therefore not universal ( see  [ sec : gli2 ] ) .",
    "one therefore expects @xmath38 to differ from pulsar to pulsar . as a corollary , the aggregate size distribution drawn from all pulsars",

    "this is consistent with the historical interpretation of the pulsar data @xcite .",
    "it is also seen in self - organized critical systems like sandpiles , where large , system - spanning , quasiperiodic avalanches of a characteristic size are interspersed with small , randomly timed avalanches , which are power - law distributed @xcite .      strictly speaking",

    "usually , this information is not provided explicitly and must be estimated from the size uncertainties quoted for detected glitches .",

    ", @xmath43 is limited by the total observing time .",
    "its true value exceeds the largest glitch observed , but not by much , because the occurrence probability decreases steeply as @xmath65 increases .    to quantify these effects ,",
    "we allow @xmath42 to vary between 0.5 and 1.0 times the smallest glitch size observed , @xmath43 to vary between 1.0 and 2.0 times the largest glitch size observed , and fit equation ( [ eq : gli3b ] ) again to the data .",
    "for every object , @xmath42 and @xmath43 shift only slightly , and @xmath38 stays within the range @xmath51 $ ] in tables [ tab : gli2 ] and [ tab : gli3 ] .",
    "this confirms that the smallest and largest glitches provide reasonable estimates of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . at the 1-@xmath47 level ,",

    "figure [ fig : gli3 ] displays the cumulative size distribution for the glitch population in aggregate , together with the best power - law fit of the form ( [ eq : gli2 ] ) .",
    "the fit is poor .",

    ", we can state confidently that the theoretical and observed data are drawn from different underlying distributions .",
    "this is not surprising ; the results in figure [ fig : gli1 ] and table [ tab : gli2 ] demonstrate clearly that the size distribution in individual pulsars is consistent with being scale invariant , but that @xmath38 differs from object to object .",
    "hence the aggregate distribution is expected to be a weighted sum of power laws , not a pure power law .",
    "accordingly , the size distribution in individual pulsars is a more direct probe of glitch physics than the aggregate distribution @xcite .",
    "the aggregate distribution can be inverted , in principle , to determine how @xmath38 is distributed across the pulsar population .",
    "we defer this exercise until better historical estimates of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and more data , become available .",
    "@xcite claimed that the glitches in psr j1740@xmath23015 are drawn from a flat size distribution in @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 , with @xmath74 .",
    "this agrees with the results in table [ tab : gli2 ] .",
    "@xcite noted some evidence for an excess of large glitches , which is corroborated to some extent by figure [ fig : gli3]a .",
    "however , the excess largely disappears when the quasiperiodic glitchers are excluded , as in figure [ fig : gli3]b .",
    "large glitches do not originate preferentially from any particular class of object . while it is true that the most active objects ( e.g.  psr j0537@xmath26910 and psr j0835@xmath24510 ) experience relatively large and narrowly distributed glitches , with @xmath75 , other active objects ( e.g. psr j1740@xmath23015 ) experience a mix of small and large events , and there are several objects ( e.g.  psr j1806@xmath24212 ) which have only glitched once , with @xmath76 for that single glitch .",
    "furthermore , although psr j0534@xmath92200 is sometimes portrayed as unusual for not experiencing large glitches , its size distribution is actually relatively flat ( @xmath1 ) . there is every reason to expect that it will experience large glitches in the future , but these events will be slow in coming , because psr j0534@xmath92200 builds up differential rotation between the crust and superfluid at a relatively slow rate , as we show in  [ sec : gli5 ] . observed during glitches .",
    "this paradox is resolved if most of the differential rotation is being stored temporarily , in advance of a large glitch in the future . ]",
    "if pulsar glitches are the result of an avalanche process , they should be statistically independent events . to understand why , recall that a system in a self - organized critical state configures itself into many metastable stress reservoirs insulated by relaxed zones (  [ sec : gli2 ] ) .",
    "every avalanche relaxes one reservoir , typically occupying a small fraction of the system , and the next avalanche occurs at random , typically far from its predecessor .",
    "there is essentially no interference between successive avalanches ; this is verified empirically in tests with cellular automata @xcite .",
    "avalanches in the tail of the size distribution , which relax the whole system , are an ( extremely rare ) exception .    given statistical independence , and assuming that the system is driven at a constant ( mean ) rate , the avalanche model predicts that the time between successive glitches , @xmath77 , termed the waiting time , obeys poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "hence , in any individual pulsar , the waiting - time distribution is exponential , with probability density function @xmath78 the mean glitching rate @xmath3 is different for every pulsar .",
    "it depends on the rate at which differential rotation builds up between the superfluid and the crist ( @xmath79 ) as well as the capacity to store the differential rotation ( e.g.  strength of pinning , rate of vortex creep , shear modulus of the crust ) . the storage capacity is presumably controlled by thermodynamic variables like temperature , as well as the inhomogeneous nuclear structure of the crust .",
    "we do not expect @xmath3 to change appreciably during four decades of pulsar timing . in principle , however , as more data are collected in future , this claim can be tested by using a bayesian blocks algorithm to divide the time series into a sequence of poisson processes with piecewise - constant rates @xcite . is constant over decades , because the thermodynamic variables that control storage capacity ( e.g.  temperature ) are nearly constant on such a time - scale . yet the sun provides a cautionary counterexample : the dynamics of subphotospheric turbulence , and hence the rate of solar flaring , vary with the 11-yr solar cycle @xcite . ]",
    "the avalanche model makes a further powerful prediction .",
    "suppose the system tends to a stationary , self - organised critical state , in which global driving balances local release in a time - averaged sense [ property ( vi ) ,  2 ] , i.e.  there is no secular accumulation or leakage of stress .",
    "stationarity implies that the mean waiting time @xmath80 , multiplied by the rate at which crust - superfluid differential rotation builds up ( @xmath7 ) , equals the mean glitch size @xmath81 , i.e.   @xmath82 here , @xmath83 is the relative angular acceleration of the crust and superfluid . importantly",
    ", glitch data allow @xmath84 to be measured directly in principle @xcite .",
    "however , there is a serious question as to whether stationarity is achieved in practice , during the @xmath85 yr that a typical pulsar has been observed .",
    "we discuss this issue further below .    to test the above ideas , we compare the observed cumulative waiting - time distributions of the same nine pulsars as in  [ sec : gli4 ] , with @xmath33 , against the theoretical cumulative distribution . in order to make the comparison fairly",
    ", we must first adjust for observational selection effects .",
    "any given obesrvation can detect waiting times in a range @xmath86 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath87 is set by the total data span available for that pulsar , i.e.  @xmath88 .",
    "the lower limit @xmath89 is different at different epochs .",
    "it is set by the gap between data spans in which a glitch is localized . for small glitches ,",
    "the glitch epoch is determined by requiring continuity of pulse phase across the glitch . for larger glitches , where the phase winding number is ambiguous , the epoch is taken to be halfway between the bounding observations @xcite . either way , @xmath89 is different for each glitch , and is twice the absolute value of the epochal uncertainty quoted in table [ tab : gli1 ] @xcite .",
    "let @xmath90 be the observing - time - weighted probability that , when a glitch occurs , @xmath89 lies in the range @xmath91 $ ] , and let the smallest and largest values of @xmath89 be @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively , recorded in table [ tab : gli4 ] for the nine pulsars with @xmath33 .",
    "then the cumulative waiting - time distribution is given by @xmath94 where each glitch is weighted equally in the sum in ( [ eq : gli7 ] ) as a first approximation .",
    "in figure [ fig : gli4 ] , we plot as cumulative histograms the measured waiting - time distributions of the nine pulsars in figure [ fig : gli1 ] .",
    "the theoretical curves ( [ eq : gli7 ] ) are overlaid , with @xmath89 and @xmath87 chosen according to the second through fourth columns in table [ tab : gli4 ] . for each object , we choose @xmath3 to minimize the k - s statistic @xmath44 .",

    "for all nine pulsars in figure [ fig : gli4 ] and table [ tab : gli4 ] , the null hypothesis that the waiting - time distribution is described by poisson statistics is not ruled out at the 1-@xmath47 level .",
    "the data are therefore consistent with an avalanche process .",
    "an exponential waiting - time distribution was first postulated by @xcite for psr j0534@xmath92200 , based on timing data up to and including the glitch on mjd 51452 .",
    "these authors obtained @xmath97 and @xmath98 , marginally outside the 1-@xmath47 range in table [ tab : gli4 ] .",
    "the data analyzed here confirm that waiting times are consistent with poisson statistics in several glitching pulsars , affording a key insight into the physics of the glitch mechanism .",
    "the implications of this result are discussed further in ",
    "[ sec : gli6 ] .      for seven pulsars in figure [",

    "however , for psr j0537@xmath26910 and psr j0835@xmath24510 , the fits are marginal at the 1-@xmath47 level .",

    "these are the same two objects whose size distributions are exceptional , and which are observed to glitch quasiperiodically .",

    "significantly , the data imply @xmath108 . in other words , the delta - distributed component accounts for the same fraction of the size and waiting - time distributions , even though the sizes and waiting times are statistically independent .",
    "this raises confidence in the model and suggests that a quasiperiodic component is indeed present and distinct .",
    "it also suggests that the quasiperiodic component coexists with the poisson component , instead of completely displacing it .",

    "second , except for the two pulsars which show quasiperiodicity , @xmath38 appears to vary smoothly with spin - down age , with @xmath1 for the youngest pulsars ( e.g.  the crab ) .",
    "figure [ fig : gli9 ] depicts the trend between @xmath38 and @xmath192 .",
    "it is suggestive ; after all , local pinning forces do depend on temperature and hence @xmath192 .",
    "interestingly , however , there is no clear trend between @xmath38 and @xmath17 , even though the mean vortex spacing ( and hence intervortex force ) is proportional to @xmath193",

    "an avalanche process predicts a specific relation between the distributions of glitch sizes @xmath65 and lifetimes @xmath194 ( as opposed to waiting times @xmath77 ) .",
    "specifically , in a self - organized critical state , the lifetime probability density function is also a power law , @xmath195 , with @xmath196 the constants @xmath197 and @xmath198 are defined such that the cardinality of an avalanche scales with its linear extent ( @xmath199 ) as @xmath200 and its lifetime ( i.e.  duration ) scales as @xmath201 @xcite .",

    "many authors have searched for a correlation between waiting time and the size of the next glitch .",
    "such a correlation appears to be absent from the data , e.g.  figure 17 in @xcite and figure 10 in @xcite . at first blush ,",
    "this is surprising : the vortex unpinning and crust fracture paradigms , which are driven by the accumulation of differential rotation and mechanical stress respectively , seem to be natural candidates for a ` reservoir effect ' .",
    "avalanche dynamics resolves this apparent paradox .",
    "the reservoir effect does operate locally , but the star contains many reservoirs , insulated from each other by relaxed zones , whose storage capacities evolve stochastically in response to the slow driver and avalanche history . during a glitch , a single reservoir ( often small but sometimes large ) relaxes at random via an avalanche , releasing its stored @xmath65 ( and destabilizing neighboring reservoirs in preparation for the next glitch ) . some of the @xmath65 is accumulated since the previous glitch , but the remainder is ` borrowed ' from earlier epochs , when some other reservoir relaxed instead .",
    "all self - organized critical systems share these dynamics ; the waiting time is uncorrelated with the size of the next avalanche @xcite .",
    "the only exceptions are large , system - spanning avalanches , which always have roughly the same sizes and waiting times , and which account for @xmath188 of the glitches in psr j0537@xmath26910 and psr j0835@xmath24510 .",
    "a corollary of the previous paragraph is that the total @xmath65 released in glitches up to some epoch is less than the total crust - superfluid differential rotation accumulated since that epoch , viz .",
    "@xmath213 where @xmath7 is the relative angular acceleration of the crust and superfluid due to electromagnetic spin down .",
    "the ` staircase ' described by ( [ eq : gli17 ] ) has been noted previously @xcite , both in quasiperiodic glitchers like psr j0537@xmath26910 [ e.g.  figure 8 in @xcite ] , where the reservoir effect is obvious , and in poisson glitchers like psr j0534@xmath92200 , [ e.g.  figure 12 in @xcite ] , where the trend is more subtle because it reverts to the mean over long times , not after every glitch . upon dividing ( [ eq : gli17 ] ) by @xmath30 , and averaging over long times ,",
    "the inequality becomes an equality ( provided there is no secular accumulation of differential rotation in the system ) and we recover ( [ eq : gli5 ] ) .",
    "it is fundamentally impossible to measure @xmath84 for individual pulsars with current data , because @xmath109 is dominated by large ( and therefore rare ) glitches for @xmath11 .",
    "it is therefore wrong to assume stationarity over a typical , @xmath85-yr observation interval .",
    "consequently , we are prompted to reassess the familiar correlation between activity and spin - down age @xcite .",

    "@xcite , binned over semi - decades in @xmath5 , effectively averages together different pulsars . while this approach reduces the formal error bar on @xmath214 , its physical interpretation is less straightforward , given the likelihood that @xmath84 is different in different pulsars .",

    "however , the full picture is more complicated .",
    "vela s quasiperiodic avalanches point to a richly connected network of reservoirs @xcite , yet its aggregated value @xmath214 is relatively low . on the other hand , the other quasiperiodic glitcher , psr j0537@xmath26910 , is relatively young ( @xmath224 ) ; how did it form a richly connected reservoir network so quickly ? and , if its network is so richly connected , why is its aggregated @xmath214 value so low ? likewise , psr j0358@xmath95413 is the oldest object in the sample ( @xmath225 ) , yet its @xmath84 value arguably points to a dearth of capacitive elements , characteristic of a young object .",

    "however , most do so infrequently ( low @xmath3 ) and hence have not been detected during the last four decades of timing experiments . we find that up to @xmath226 of the pulsar population can glitch at rates lower than @xmath227 yr@xmath156 and still conform with the measured aggregate waiting - time distribution .",
    "once verified , the claimed poissonian nature of the glitch mechanism can be invoked to exclude broad classes of glitch theories , e.g.  those that rely on ` defects ' or ` turbulence ' at special locations ( like the pole ) , or that involve a pair of dependent events ( a.  martin , private communication ) .",
    "it is important to interpret aftershocks carefully in this light @xcite . in self - organized critical systems , the excess number of avalanches following a large avalanche ( over and above the poissonian baseline following a small avalanche ) scales inversely with the time elapsed , a property known as omori s law for earthquakes @xcite .    in this paper",

    "<S> we test statistically the hypothesis that radio pulsar glitches result from an avalanche process , in which angular momentum is transferred erratically from the flywheel - like superfluid in the star to the slowly decelerating , solid crust via spatially connected chains of local , impulsive , threshold - activated events , so that the system fluctuates around a self - organised critical state . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the glitch population ( currently 285 events from 101 pulsars ) demonstrates that the size distribution in individual pulsars is consistent with being scale invariant , as expected for an avalanche process . </S>",
    "<S> the measured power - law exponents fall in the range @xmath0 , with @xmath1 for the youngest pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> the waiting - time distribution is consistent with being exponential in seven out of nine pulsars where it can be measured reliably , after adjusting for observational limits on the minimum waiting time , as for a constant - rate poisson process . </S>",

    "<S> its exact form is unknown ; the exponential overestimates the number of glitching pulsars observed at low @xmath3 , where the limited total observation time exercises a selection bias . in order to reproduce the aggregate waiting - time distribution of the glitch population as a whole </S>",
