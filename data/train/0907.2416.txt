    ". measurements that rely on absorption lines are less biased to the highest densities , but they generally probe only directions toward the brightest stellar clusters , losing detail as the stars are integrated in the spectrograph slit , and are restricted to starburst galaxies @xcite . however , one counter - example is the magellanic clouds that are near enough to allow absorption line measurements toward many individual stars , and thus are excellent laboratories for studying recycling processes of energy and matter in low mass , low metallicity galaxies .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is the brightest dwarf disk galaxy in the sky situated at @xmath1050 kpc , while the smc is an irregular dwarf galaxy a little farther away at @xmath1060 kpc . with a lower metallicity and a higher gaseous mass",

    "may not be bound to the mw anymore , although , according to @xcite , there appears to be still enough uncertainties in the proper motions and circular velocities of the lmc and mw to allow these two galaxies to be bound .",

    "indeed while fe can be depleted into dust ( hence the fe / o is a priori expected to be subsolar ) , we show that this ratio is supersolar , strongly suggesting that the hvc gas is largely ionized ( independently confirmed by the systematic presence of n@xmath0ii  and o@xmath0vi  absorption ) .",

    "at 150 @xmath2 , ignoring possible drag forces and initial higher velocities , it would take about 30 to 65 myr to reach a distance of 5 to 10 kpc , respectively .",
    "therefore a small galaxy ( 1@xmath131 m@xmath9 ) such as the lmc is capable of producing outflows that may pollute its surroundings beyond its gravitational potential .",
    "the mass of the neutral gas in the outflow can be roughly estimated via , @xmath132 where the covering factor is @xmath133 from our detection rate , the average o@xmath0i  column density is @xmath134 @xmath5 , @xmath135 g is the atomic mass of hydrogen , and @xmath136 corrects for the presence of helium .",
    "the hvc seen in absorption covers the lmc disk , so we take the area of the hvc , @xmath137 , to be similar to the disk of the lmc assuming a diameter of 7.3 kpc , the diameter of the h@xmath0i  disk @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath138 m@xmath9 . using the h@xmath0i  data with @xmath139h@xmath0i@xmath140",
    ", we estimate an h@xmath0i  mass of @xmath141 m@xmath9 for the hvc gas , which gives after correcting for helium @xmath142 m@xmath9 .",
    "the main difference between these values are the difference in the covering factors between absorption and emission data .",
    "the absorption method also likely overestimates the mass because it assumes the same h@xmath0i  column density while the h@xmath0i  emission estimate misses the lower column density gas , and therefore we just adopt the average value of @xmath143 m@xmath9 .",
    "these estimates also assume that the hvc complex is at 50 kpc .",
    "if the hvc is 10 kpc away from the lmc toward us , and assuming no projection correction , the mass would be @xmath144 m@xmath9 .",
    "the neutral mass is , however , only the tip of the iceberg as the hvc is largely photoionized and collisionally ionized . including the photoionized high - velocity gas probed by fe@xmath0ii  and n@xmath0ii , the mass of the hvc increases by at least a factor 23 ( see above ) .",
    "using the measurements of the o@xmath0vi  absorption in the hvc component @xcite , the average o@xmath0vi  column density ( based on 4 measurements ) is @xmath145 @xmath5 , which would yield a h@xmath0ii  column density for the collisionally ionized gas of @xmath146h@xmath0ii@xmath147 @xmath5 assuming that the metallicity is the same as the neutral hvc and the o@xmath0vi  ion fraction is 0.2",
    ". the latter value can not be much larger than 0.2 , but could be much smaller if the temperature of the gas is far ( either way ) from the peak temperature of o@xmath0vi  in collisionally ionized equilibrium @xcite , hence @xmath146h@xmath0ii@xmath148 @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the total mass of the outflow is more likely to be @xmath149@xmath150 m@xmath9 .",
    "while this mass is much smaller than the total masses of the stream and bridge @xcite , it is similar to or possibly even larger than other large hvcs such as complex c @xcite . in view of our results",
    ", it is plausible that complex c might be the remnant of an outflow from a hidden dwarf galaxy that is being accreted by the mw .",
    "the same fate could await the lmc hvc complex .",
    "using the _ fuse _  lmc database , we search for absorption at high lsr velocity ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) of neutral , ionized , and molecular species in the spectra of early - type stars located in the lmc .",
    "we use sensitive parkes observations of h@xmath0i  21 cm for comparison , and for 10 stars , we completement the _ fuse _  data with stis e140 m data .",
    "our final sample consists of 139 lines of sight , 44 of them showing both o@xmath0i  absorption and h@xmath0i  emission at high lsr velocities , an unprecedented number of sightlines where the metallicity can be estimated in a large hvc complex .",
    "our main results for the hvcs toward the lmc are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the detection rates of high - velocity o@xmath0i  @xmath151039 , fe@xmath0ii  @xmath151144 , and n@xmath0ii  @xmath151083 absorption toward our lmc stars are about 70%",
    ". the detection rate of o@xmath0vi  @xmath151031 could be even higher , @xmath1090% . while the quality of the data changes from sightline to sightline , the high detection rates imply that the hvcs cover a subtantial area of the lmc .",
    "in contrast the h@xmath0i  21-cm emission spectra along the same sightline only reveal the hvc at a 32% rate .",
    "since the neutral , ionized , and highly ionized hvcs are found at similar velocities along a given sightline , the hvc has a complex multiphase structure .",
    "however , we did not find any evidence of cold ( @xmath151 k ) or molecular gas , which is not surprising in view of the low h@xmath0i   column density of the hvcs ( @xmath139h@xmath0i@xmath152 ) .",
    "we find a mean and dispersion of @xmath6si@xmath0ii / o@xmath0i@xmath7 = + 0.48 \\,^{+0.15}_{-0.25}$ ] ( 14 sightlines ) .",
    "since si and o have similar chemical evolution and are only mildly depleted in diffuse gas , this implies that the gas is @xmath10180% ionized . using a larger sample , we find @xmath6fe@xmath0ii / o@xmath0i@xmath7 = + 0.33 \\,^{+0.14}_{-0.21}$ ] ( 77 sightlines ) , implying that the gas is largely ionized toward every direction probed , @xmath97% on average but as large as @xmath98% toward many sightlines , consistent with the high detection rate of n@xmath0ii . the high occurrence of o@xmath0vi  ( and substantial column densities ,",

    "* ) implies that the hvc is also largely ( possibly dominantly ) highly ionized .",
    "\\4 . using the ratios of si@xmath0ii / s@xmath0ii  and si@xmath0ii / fe@xmath0ii",
    ", we conclude that there is some evidence of mild elemental depletion , which implies the presence of dust grains in these hvcs .    \\5 . from the sample where limits are excluded ,",

    "there is no evidence of intrinsic variation in the abundance of oxygen , suggesting that these hvcs are part of a single complex that has the same origin .",
    "\\6 . based on stellar and nebular abundances , the present - day o abundances of the lmc and smc are @xmath154 and @xmath155 dex solar .",
    "therefore , the hvc metallicity toward the lmc is more consistent with the lmc o abundance . dust depletion may affect the o interstellar abundance by a small amount ( @xmath156 dex ) .",
    "in that case , the ( small ) correction would increase the metallicity of the hvc , and hence @xmath107 $ ] of the hvc complex would converge to the present - day canonical lmc o abundance .",
    "we do not find strong dependence in the relative or absolute abundances with any other quantities ( e.g. , galactic coordinates , h@xmath0i  column density , or velocity ) .",
    "however , the average velocities of the hvcs in the lmcsr or lsr frames show a gradient with the right ascension ( or galactic latitude ) .",
    "interestingly , most of the supergiant shells believed to produce strong outflows in galaxies are situated at ra@xmath127 where the deviation velocities of the hvcs from the average velocities of the lmc disk are the highest .",
    "we estimate that the mass of the neutral gas of the hvc complex is @xmath157@xmath158 m@xmath9 if the hvc complex is at 4050 kpc . including the photoionized and collisionally ionized gas , the total mass is likely @xmath159 m@xmath9 .",
    "this is comparable to or larger than the total mass of complex c.    \\9 .",
    "all of our observational results are consistent with a generalized galactic outflow from the lmc as the origin of the hvc complex at lsr velocity 90175 @xmath2  distributed across the lmc , including the metallicity and kinematics of the hvcs as well as earlier findings from radio , optical and uv observations .",
    "this origin also naturally explains why the hvc is principally ionized , with both signatures of photoionization and collisional ionization .",
    "dust grains are found in other known major galactic winds , and there is evidence of dust in this hvc complex as well .",
    "however , we do not find any strong evidence of infalling material , therefore the hvc gas is likely to escape the lmc potential , suggesting that the lmc has a galactic wind .",
    "ultimately this hvc complex may be accreted by the mw and serve as additional fuel for future star formation within the mw . based on these findings , it is possible that other large hvc complexes found in the mw halo could be the result of outflows from nearby low mass galaxies ( galaxies that could be now hidden by the mw disk ) .",
