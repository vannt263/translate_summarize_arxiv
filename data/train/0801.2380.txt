    "uncovering the missing baryons in the present - day universe is one of the central issues in observational cosmology , because an accurate accounting of the baryon budget at different locations sets an important constraint in modeling galaxy formation and evolution . over the past few years",
    ", measurements of the baryonic mass density from independent methods have approached a consistent value with high precision , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "but while @xmath18% of all baryons can be accounted for in the  forest at redshift @xmath19 @xcite , only @xmath20 have been identified at redshift @xmath21 in known components , such as stars and neutral gas in galaxies or hot plasma in galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "cosmological simulations indicate that @xmath22% of all baryons at the present epoch reside in a diffuse warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , with temperatures in the range @xmath23 k , rather than in virialized halos where galaxies or galaxy groups lie @xcite .",
    "the simulations also show that this whim is shock - heated as tenuous gas accretes onto large - scale filamentary structures and remains hot owing to the low gas density and inefficient cooling .",
    "locating the whim in order to verify these models is difficult , because the temperature of the gas is too low to be easily detected with the current generation of x - ray satellites and is too hot to be observed from the ground using optical - ir facilities .",
    "simple ionization modeling of hot gas at @xmath24 k and metallicity 0.1 solar has shown that the gaseous clouds would imprint prominent absorption features produced by ionic transitions such as ovi @xmath25 1031 , 1037 and neviii @xmath25 770 , 780 in the spectra of background qsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "surveys for the whim based on the presence of these ions at @xmath26 therefore require a high - resolution uv spectrograph in space .",
    "@xcite searched for intervening ovi absorbers along the sightline toward h1821@xmath27643 ( @xmath28 ) in echelle spectra ( @xmath29 ) obtained using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the search indicated that intervening ovi absorption systems found in qso spectra may indeed contain a significant fraction of baryons that had been missed by surveys based on the direct detection of photons emitted by known objects .",
    "subsequent searches along individual sightlines have been carried out toward pg0953@xmath27415 at @xmath30 @xcite , pg1259@xmath27593 at @xmath31 @xcite ; pg1116@xmath27215 at @xmath32 @xcite , pks0405@xmath33123 at @xmath34 @xcite , and he0226@xmath334110 at @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "the large scatter in the observed number density of ovi absorbers suggests a significant variation in the spatial distribution of o@xmath44 ions across different sightlines .",
    "it also underscores a potential systematic bias in evaluating the cosmological mass density of warm - hot gas based on selective quasar sightlines .",
    "the first blind search of ovi absorbers was carried out at @xmath45 $ ] toward 11 background quasars by @xcite using medium resolution ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 faint object spectrograph spectra .",
    "they reported @xmath48 per line of sight at a mean redshift @xmath49 with @xmath50 m .",

    "absorbers at @xmath51 , using far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) spectra ( @xmath52 ) of 31 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "their search yielded @xmath53 and @xmath54 per line of sight with @xmath36 and @xmath55 m , respectively , at @xmath56 , which is lower than measurements from individual lines of sight discussed earlier .    despite the large scatter in the number density of intervening ovi absorbers ,",
    "these measurements imply that at least @xmath57 of the total baryons reside in the gaseous clouds probed by the ovi transition . assuming a mean metallicity of 1/10 solar and an ionization fraction of 20% for the ovi absorbers , tripp @xmath58  ( 2000 ) derived a lower limit to the cosmological mass density in the ionized gas of @xmath59 and danforth & shull ( 2005 ) derived @xmath60 .",
    "this general inference of ovi absorbers being a substantial reservoir of missing baryons is supported by numerical simulations that result in a mean metallicity of @xmath61 solar for the whim @xcite .",
    "however , additional uncertainties arise due to the unknown ionization state and metallicity of the gas .",
    "we have conducted a systematic survey of intervening ovi absorbers in available echelle spectra obtained using hst / stis with the e140 m grating .",
    "a search of the hst data archive yielded high - resolution ( @xmath62 ) spectra of 16 distant quasars at @xmath0 with a mean @xmath63 per resolution element .",
    "these quasars have been selected by different authors for different studies and have bright uv fluxes that are suitable for stis echelle observations .",
    "therefore , they represent a random , flux - limited sample of quasar spectra for an unbiased search of intervening absorbers .",
    "the entire stis echelle spectroscopic sample of quasars summarized in table 1 defines the random sightlines along which our blind search of intervening ovi absorbers was conducted .",
    "the primary objectives of the blind ovi survey are : ( 1 ) to obtain a statistically representative sample of ovi absorbers along random lines of sight for an accurate measurement of the cosmological mass density of warm - hot gas at low redshift ; and ( 2 ) to study the incidence of ovi absorbers along individual sightlines for quantifying the spatial variation of ovi absorbing gas .",
    "these ovi absorbers identified along random sightlines also form a uniform sample for studying the physical nature of tenuous gas probed by the presence of o@xmath44 and for investigating their large - scale galactic environment . here",
    "we focus our discussion on the statistical properties of ovi absorbers",
    ". studies of the gas properties and discussions of individual absorbers are given in an accompanying paper ( thom & chen , 2008 ; hereafter paper  ii ) , and studies of the surrounding galaxies will be presented in future papers .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we summarize the available quasar spectra and the data quality .",
    "in section 3 , we describe our approach for identifying an ovi @xmath25 1031 , 1037 absorption doublet with no prior knowledge of the presence of hi or other ionic transitions .",

    "bearing in mind the large uncertainties in the metallicity and ionization fraction of the o@xmath44 bearing gas , our derived mean mass density of ionized gas is less than 10% of the total baryon mass density ( e.g.  burles @xmath58  2001 ) .",
    "we have excluded spectral regions within @xmath199 @xmath12  from the background qsos for establishing the statistical sample of random foreground absorbers in the previous discussion , due to potential contamination features from the qso host environment .",
    "however , the blind ovi search has been carried out all the way through the emission redshifts of these qsos .",
    "the ovi absorbers found in the proximity of qsos form a sample of associated absorbers that offers important constraints on the halo gas in qso hosts ( chelouche @xmath58  2007 , in prep ) .",
    "ten of the 16 qsos in our stis echelle sample exhibit strong ovi absorbers @xmath200 @xmath12  blue - shifted from their emission redshifts ( indicated in table 2 ) .",
    "we present the absorption profiles of these ovi absorbers in figure 4 .",

    "the results of our blind search are consistent with those of @xcite from a fuse survey at lower redshift that had been carried out in known  absorbers .",
    "the agreement is qualitatively consistent with the small fraction of ovi absorbers that do not have an associated  transition .",
    "the discrepancy between our results and those of @xcite based on a similar set of qso spectral sample is most puzzling . in the following , we discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "it is possible that the discrepancy is due to different qso spectra covered by different surveys .",
    "our random sample has been established based exclusively on available stis echelle data .",
    "the sightline along h1821@xmath27643 has the highest incidence of ovi absorbers of all 16 sightlines in our echelle sample ( see table 2 and the discussion in ",
    "in addition to the four ovi absorbers originally reported in @xcite and confirmed in our blind search , @xcite reported an additional ovi absorber at @xmath217 in a targeted search in higher quality fuse spectra . at @xmath217 ,",
    "the ovi @xmath218 line is redshifted to @xmath219  , where the sensitivity of stis echelle declines steeply .",
    "the lack of sensitivity at the blue end of the echelle sample is accounted for by the completeness study of our random sample discussed in   3.2 .",
    "this @xmath217 absorber found in a targeted search after including additional fuse spectra does not satisfy the criterion for establishing a statistically unbiased sample , and has therefore been excluded in our random sample .",
    "in addition , there are ovi absorbers reported in the literature but not confirmed by our search . along the same redshift path - length covered by our survey ,",
    "16 foreground ovi systems have been reported in the literature by other authors toward seven qsos ( he0226@xmath334110 , pks0405@xmath33123 , pg0953@xmath27415 , pg1116@xmath27215 , pg1259@xmath27593 , h1821@xmath27643 , and 3c273 ; see table 2 for corresponding references ) , four are not confirmed in our survey .",
    "an example is shown in panel ( d ) of figure 1 , where we show the spectral region of an ovi doublet along the sightline toward pg1259@xmath27593 reported by @xcite .",
    "the putative ovi 1031 member is blended with the siiii 1206 transition of a  absorber at @xmath220 ( the feature at @xmath221 @xmath12 ) and the ciii transition of a  absorbers at @xmath222 ( the feature at @xmath223 @xmath12 ) .",
    "our search routine did not accept this absorber due to discrepant line strengths .",
    "our random sample does not include this possible absorber .",
    "along the same sightline , @xcite also reported the presence of an ovi absorber at @xmath224 , which is not confirmed by our routine due to discrepant absorption profiles and an inconsistent line ratio .",
    "along the sightline toward he0226@xmath334110 , @xcite reported five ovi absorbers with @xmath225 .",
    "we can not confirm the presence of their identification for a @xmath226 absorber .",
    "in particular , the putative feature identified as the ovi 1037 member is not present in our own reduction of the echelle spectra . inspections of individual exposures showed that the broad feature are predominant in two of the 12 exposures , but the discrepancy may be due to different treatment in the hot pixels in echelle spectra ( t.  tripp , private communication ) .",
    "additional spectra obtained using the cosmic origin spectrograph ( cos ) or stis will be valuable for confirming the presence of the doublet . consequently , this absorber is not included in our random sample .",
    "various studies of individual ovi absorbers that consider both kinematic signatures of the absorption profiles and abundance ratios between different ions have concluded that a large fraction of these absorbers can be explained by a simple photo - ionization model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results are in contradiction to the expectation of a whim origin , under which the bulk of the o@xmath44 ions originate in the shocks created as the gas accretes onto the large filamentary structures .",
    "however , it is often difficult to rule out a collisional ionization scenario for these absorbers .",
    "additional uncertainties arise , if ovi absorbers arise in post - shock gas that is undergoing radiative cooling and a simple ionization equilibrium assumption does not apply ( gnat & sternberg 2007 ) .",
    "the comparison of the absorption column densities in figure 6 between  and ovi transitions for the ovi selected sample ( solid points ) demonstrates that the @xmath15 associated with these ovi absorbers spans nearly five orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , stronger ovi transitions have on average stronger associated  transitions .",
    "the null hypothesis in which  and ovi column densities are randomly distributed among each other can be ruled out at @xmath227% confidence level based on a generalized kendall test that considers the non - detection of  for the ovi absorber at @xmath228 toward he0226@xmath334110 .",
    "we note that the stis echelle sample is sensitive to ovi absorbers of @xmath229 @xmath169  over the entire redshift path - length allowed by the data , and ovi absorbers of @xmath124 @xmath169  over @xmath230% of the sightlines .",
    "the echelle spectra therefore allow us to uncover ovi absorbers of @xmath231 over the majority of the sightlines .",
    "the correlation is therefore unlikely due to a selection bias . including measurements from known ovi absorbers at low redshift ( open squares and crosses ) , we find that the correlation remains at @xmath232% significance level .",
    "the broad range of @xmath15 spanned by these ovi absorbers also makes it difficult to apply a simple collisional ionization equilibrium model for explaining their origin .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath15 indicates that the ovi absorbers appears to track closely hi gas in overdense regions , while the opposite does not apply ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this trend can be understood under a simple photo - ionization scenario , and the slope in @xmath16 versus @xmath15 implies a declining ionization parameter ( defined as the number of ionizing photons per gas particle ) with increasing gas column density ( see figure 31 of paper ii ) .",
    "a unique feature of our blind search is that the finding of ovi doublet does not rely on known presence of  transitions .",
    "the sample therefore allows us to constrain the fraction of ovi absorbers that do not show significant traces of hi .",
    "these absorbers may represent an extreme case for outflow gas that has been ejected into underdense regions by strong galactic winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure 6",
    ", we find that 26 of the 27 ovi absorbers in the random sample show associated hi absorption features .",
    "the only one possible -free system is found to have @xmath233 at @xmath234 toward he0226@xmath334110 ( the arrow in figure 6 ) .",
    "the comparison indicates that @xmath14% of ovi absorbers originate in underdense regions of @xmath235  that are heavily metal - enriched by starburst outflows      cosmological simulations also show that ovi absorbers originating in the whim reside in regions of over - density @xmath236 at @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "this is similar to what is found in simulation studies of  forest absorbers , according to which by @xmath21 the majority of  absorbers are associated with @xmath238 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine the relation between  and ovi absorbers .    of the 16 qso sightlines in our echelle sample , seven",
    "have been studied extensively for the line - of - sight properties of  absorbers @xcite .",
    "we present in figure 7 a comparison of the observed number densities between  absorbers and ovi absorbers measured along individual sightlines .",
    "these include h1821@xmath27643 , he0226@xmath334110 , hs0624@xmath276907 , pg0953@xmath27415 , pg1116@xmath27215 , pg1259@xmath27593 , and pks0405@xmath33123 .",
    "the statistics of  absorbers are taken from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "we have included the corrected  absorber catalog for the pks0405@xmath33123 sightline .",
    "the error bars represent 1-@xmath90 uncertainties .    considering all seven sightlines together",
    ", we find a mean number density of @xmath239 for the  absorbers with an r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of 15 .",
    "in contrast , we find @xmath240 for the ovi absorbers with an r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of 10 .",
    "examining the number density variation from one sightline to another , we find that the line of sight toward h1821@xmath27643 with the highest incidence of ovi absorbers has the lowest incidence of absorbers .",
    "figure 7 shows a possible inverse correlation between the number density of absorbers and the number density of ovi absorbers .",
    "while  absorbers appear to be relatively more abundant than ovi along each sightline , the number density of ovi absorbers do not scale proportionally with the number density of  absorbers along individual lines of sight .",
    "this anti - correlation between @xmath241_{\\rm o\\,vi}$ ] and @xmath241_{\\rm { \\mbox{${\\rm ly}\\alpha$}}}$ ] may be understood , if those sightlines with a higher incidence of ovi absorbers probe a larger fraction of more highly ionized regions .",
    "however , we note the result from   6.1 , where we find nearly every one of the ovi absorbers in our statistical sample shows an associated  transition . on the other hand ,",
    "if ovi absorbers originate preferentially in underdense regions , then a higher incidence of ovi implies a substantial fraction of the sightline probe underdense regions and hence a lower incidence of  absorbers .",
    "this is expected if heavy elements from starburst outflows are ejected primarily into underdense regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further insights can be obtained from a detailed examination of the large - scale galaxy environment of the ovi absorbers .",
    "a larger sample of qso echelle spectra will also be valuable for a more quantitative study to confirm this result .",
    "we have conducted a systematic survey of intervening ovi absorbers in available echelle spectra obtained using hst / stis with the e140 m grating .",
    "we have collected echelle spectra of 16 distant qsos from the hst data archive .",
    "these uv bright quasars at @xmath0 have been selected for hst / stis observations by different authors for different studies , and represent a random , flux - limited sample of qso echelle spectra for an unbiased search of intervening absorbers .",
    "the primary objectives of our blind ovi survey are : ( 1 ) to obtain a statistically representative sample of ovi absorbers along random lines of sight for an accurate measurement of the cosmological mass density of warm - hot gas at low redshift ; and ( 2 ) to study the incidence of ovi absorbers along individual sightlines for quantifying the spatial variation of ovi absorbing gas .",
    "our search in the stis echelle qso sample has uncovered a total of 27  random ( @xmath242 @xmath12  from the background qso ) @xmath1  absorbers with rest - frame absorption equivalent width of the 1031 member @xmath210 along 16 lines of sight .",
    "ten of these qsos also exhibit strong ovi absorbers at @xmath243 @xmath12  blue - shifted from the qso emission redshifts .",
    "our ovi survey differs from previous studies in two fundamental ways .",
    "first , we do not require prior knowledge of the presence of other transitions such as .",
    "the echelle resolution allows us to identify the ovi absorption doublet based on their common line centroid and known flux ratio .",
    "second , the survey completeness is well understood and characterized based on a series of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we obtain an equivalent width threshold curve for every qso sightline .",
    "together , these curves allow us to estimate the total redshift survey path as a function of equivalent width threshold , thereby maximizing the survey efficiency at the limit allowed by the echelle spectra .",
    "based on the results of the monte - carlo simulations , we derive a total redshift path for random absorbers of @xmath4 , and 2.42 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 m , respectively .",
    "the total path - length surveyed in our sample is comparable to the fuse survey carried out at @xmath85 by danforth & shull ( 2005 ) , and is the largest at @xmath244 .",
    "the estimated total redshift path leads to a number density of @xmath245 and @xmath246 @xmath212 .",
    "recent numerical simulations that allow non - equilibrium ionization conditions explain the observations very well .",
    "in contrast , we also measure @xmath247 for ovi absorbers of @xmath209 in the vicinity of background qsos . for the sample of 27 random ovi absorbers ,",
    "we further derive a mean cosmological mass density of the ovi ions @xmath13 that leads to a mean cosmological mass density of warm baryons @xmath198 .    using the statistical sample of ovi absorbers ,",
    "we show that @xmath14% of ovi absorbers originate in underdense regions that do not show significant trace of hi .",
