    "a neutron - star low - mass x - ray binary ( ns - lmxb ) consists of a weakly magnetized neutron star and a low - mass star .",
    "ns - lmxbs are known to exhibit soft and hard states in x - ray band , when their mass - accretion rate is high and low , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the soft state ,",
    "the spectra are dominated by a soft / thermal component , while a hard / comptonized component is also recognized .",
    "the soft / thermal component is well described by an optically thick standard accretion disk model @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field of the ns is weak ( @xmath4  g ) , the magnetic field does not to affect the accretion flow , and the accretion disk can extend down to the ns surface .",
    "most of the gas in the disk accretes onto the ns equatorial region .",
    "as the luminosity decreases , a soft - to - hard transition occurs in the inner disk from optically thick to thin",
    ". then the radius of the inner disk becomes larger .",
    "it is called a truncated disk @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of soft - to - hard transition is known to be 1%4% of the eddington luminosity @xcite . in the hard state ,",
    "the spectra are dominated by a hard / comptonized component , while a soft / thermal component is still required .",
    "the geometry of the accretion flow changes to the optically thin disk accreting to the whole surface of the ns .",
    "the hard / comptonized component has been observed in both soft and hard states ( see @xcite for a review ) . however , there are differences between the two states in the fitting parameters with the comptonized component . in the soft state ,",
    "the optical depth ( @xmath5 ) and the electron temperature ( @xmath6 ) of the comptonized component are @xmath7  515 and @xmath6 = a few kev , while those in the hard state are @xmath7  23 and @xmath6 = a few tens of kev .",
    "location of the compton cloud has two possibilities .",
    "one is that the compton cloud takes place in a transition layer ( tl ) ( tl : @xcite ) located between the disk and ns ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the other is an accretion disk corona ( adc ) above the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both the location of the compton cloud and the origin of the seed photons remain uncertain .",
    "furthermore , an additional hard x - ray component has been detected above @xmath8 30  kev in the both states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "origin of the emission also remains uncertain , although there are several models , such as comptonization by bulk motion of accreting matter near the ns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , comptonization by non - thermal electrons accelerated in a jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and synchrotron emission of energetic electrons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "titarchuk , seifina , and shrader ( 2014 ) reported that the additional hard x - ray component was evidence for the presence a hot outer part of the tl ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "ns - lmxbs have been classified into two groups , z sources and atoll sources , based on their behavior on the color  color diagram and hardness ",
    "intensity diagram @xcite .",
    "z sources are bright and sometimes reach as close as the eddington luminosity . on the other hand , atoll sources are less bright , and some of them exhibit hard / soft spectral state transitions . in the color ",
    "color diagram , the distribution can be divided into two main regions , `` banana '' and `` island . ''",
    "the spectrum is usually softer in the banana than in the island .",
    "the distributions of the diagrams ( of color  color and hardness ",
    "intensity ) depend on the energy band , the instrument response , and the absorbing column density towards the source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gladstone , done , and gierliski ( 2007 ) investigated how the banana branch moves in the color  color diagram ( soft color : 46.4  kev@xmath134  kev and hard color : 9.716  kev@xmath16.49.7  kev ) for inclination angles of , , and .",
    "the change is mainly in the soft color .",
    "they also investigated the effect of @xmath6 of 2.5 , 3.0 , and 3.5  kev for each inclination angle .",
    "this matches very well with the location and the shape of the banana branches in their color  color diagrams .    the surface magnetic field of the ns is believed to be higher in the z sources ( @xmath9  g ) than in the atoll sources ( @xmath10  g ) @xcite .",
    "for example , the magnetic field of a z - source cyg  x-2 was estimated to be @xmath11  g from the observed oscillations in the horizontal - branch and the beat frequency model @xcite . for a transient z - source xte  j1701@xmath0462 ,",
    "the magnetic field was estimated to be @xmath8(13 ) @xmath12  g from the interaction between the magnetosphere and the radiation - pressure - dominated accretion disk @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "two atoll sources , 4u  1608@xmath052 and aql  x-1 , were estimated to have magnetic fields of @xmath13@xmath14  g from the propeller effect ( 4u  1608@xmath052 : @xcite ; @xcite , aql  x-1 : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , titarchuk , bradshaw , and wood ( 2001 ) suggested that both z sources and atoll sources have a very low surface magnetic fields of @xmath15@xmath14  g based on their magneto - acoustic wave model and the observed khz qpos . also using the khz qpo , @xcite estimated the magnetic field of @xmath8  ( 18)@xmath16  g for cyg  x-2 from the khz qpo observability in the variations of the ns magnetosphere radius ( alfvn radius ) .",
    "@xcite also reported that the magnetic fields of two atoll sources , 4u  1820@xmath030 and aql  x-1 were estimated to be @xmath17  g and @xmath8  ( 0.31)@xmath16  g , respectively .    in general , the effect of the magnetic fields of ns - lmxb is ignored because it is weak .",
    "however , in some cases , importance of the effect is suggested ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the inner disk radius could be set by the magnetospheric radius when the gas pressure from disk decreases by large radiation pressure and the magnetosphere expands .",
    "@xcite considered a tl between the innermost keplerian orbit and the magnetosphere , and suggested that the accretion flow is disturbed by the several instabilities .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that the disappearance of the khz qpo was related to the disappearance of magnetosphere ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they also noted that the effect of magnetic field of ns must be taken into account . in this study , we considered the effect of the magnetic fields of ns .",
    "we investigated average hardness ratio ( _ hr _ : 1550  kev@xmath1210  kev ) in the soft state of nine bright atoll ns - lmxbs using maxi @xcite / gsc ( gas slit camera : @xcite ; @xcite)http://maxi.riken.jp/@xmath2 . ] and swift @xcite / bat ( burst alert telescope : @xcite)http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov / docs / swift / results / transients/@xmath2 . ] from 2009 august 15 ( mjd = 55058 ) to 2015 august 15 ( mjd = 57249 ) . in section  2 , we describe the data selection and analysis of the hardness  luminosity diagram .",
    "in section  3 , we discuss the relation between hard tail emission and magnetic fields of ns - lmxb .",
    "the conclusion is presented in section  4 .",
    "we obtained long - term one - day bin light curves of maxi / gsc and swift / bat for nine bright atoll ns - lmxbs .",
    "the light curves of 210  kev band of gsc and 1550  kev band of bat and the _ hr _ of the two bands are shown for each source in figure  13 .",
    "the obtained count rates of gsc and bat were converted to luminosities by assuming a crab - like spectrum @xcite and the distances listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the assumption of crab - like spectrum is acceptable in the hard state , because the energy spectrum is dominated by the comptonized emission approximated by a power law with the photon index of 12 . on the other hand , in the soft state",
    ", the energy spectrum is dominated by the thermal emission .",
    "the obtained luminosity by assuming crab - like spectrum is underestimated in the 210  kev band , but is overestimated in the 1550  kev band . as a result , the _ hr _ of two energy bands is overestimated by 2.0 times ( see @xcite for detail ) . therefore , we handle only the relative difference ( see appendix ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the histograms ( number of days ) of the _ hr _ ( bat@xmath1gsc ) of all the nine ns - lmxbs .",
    "the peak around _",
    "hr_=1 corresponds to the hard state , while the distribution around _",
    "hr_=0.1 corresponds to the soft state .",
    "the soft state shows two peaks .",
    "the boundary of the two peaks ( _ hr _ at the smallest value ) is 0.09 ( dotted line in figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we also make the distributions of _",
    "hr_s for the individual sources in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the distributions of the soft state are divided into two groups using the peak value of _",
    "one is that _ hr _ of the peak is smaller than 0.09 : aql  x-1 , 4u  1608@xmath052 , gx  3@xmath181 , gx  9@xmath189 , gx  13@xmath181 , and gx  9@xmath181 .",
    "the other is that the _ hr _ is larger than 0.09 : 4u  1820@xmath030 and 4u  1735@xmath044 .",
    "we note that 4u  1705@xmath044 is exceptional since the peak is at _ hr_=0.09 .      to investigate the difference between two groups in the soft state , we selected the data of only the soft state .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows periods of the soft state that are analyzed in this paper .",
    "four sources ( gx  3@xmath181 , gx  9@xmath189 , gx  13@xmath181 , and",
    "gx  9@xmath181 ) stayed in the soft state during the observed period , which is obvious since there is no distribution of the hard state ( around _ hr_=1 ) in figure  [ fig5 ] .",

    "we    excluded the data during the transition in the same way as aql  x-1 .",

    "this result is consistent with the results of spectral model fitting for rxte data of 4u  1820@xmath030 and gx  3@xmath181 ( see appendix ) . in the next section ,",

    "the results would be related to properties of each ns , such as magnetic fields .",
    "the difference of _ hr _",
    "( 1550@xmath1210  kev ) comes from that of the 1550  kev luminosity , because the _ hr _ is almost constant for a wide range of 210  kev luminosity . for example , the 210  kev luminosities of both sources , aql  x-1 and 4u  1820@xmath030 , are in the same range of ( @xmath81.230)@xmath19 erg s@xmath20 . on the other hand , the _ hr _ of aql  x-1 is smaller than 0.09 and that of 4u  1820@xmath030 is larger than 0.09 as shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the emission in the 1550  kev energy band is known to originate from the comptonized component .",
    "we show the _ hr _ of the energy range ( 1550@xmath1210  kev ) would not be affected by the following differences as below .",
    "inclination : :    in general , the difference in the _ hr _ distribution is interpreted by    the difference of the inclination of the system @xcite .",
    "when the    inclination is high , _ hr _ tend to be large because of large    @xmath5 .",
    "gx  13@xmath181 is known to be high    inclination system because of the periodic dipping and the deep fe    absorption features ( 6080@xmath21 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if    the distribution of _ hr _ in figure  [ fig6 ] reflects the inclination ,    gx  13@xmath181 is expected to distribute in the higher part    than the threshold ( 0.09 ) . however , the result is opposite",
    ". the other    sources would not be high inclination system because periodic dipping    has not been reported .",
    "thus the value of _ hr _ would be independent of    the inclination , when we used the energy band of    1550@xmath1210  kev .",

    "the change of @xmath6 as described by titarchuk ,    seifina , and frontera ( 2013 ) would appear as the scatter in the _ hr _    for each source .",
    "+    the _ hr _ of 4u  1820@xmath030 and 4u",
    "1735@xmath044 is    larger than the threshold . in the case of 4u  1820@xmath030 ,    the composition of the accreting matter is helium @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 would be higher than hydrogen accretion of    other sources .",
    "however , the orbital period ( thus separation ) of    4u  1735@xmath044 is large and the companion star would be a    normal star .",
    "thus the accreting matter would be hydrogen .",
    "helium    accretion can not be a common reason for the large compton component .",
    "thus , the classification of two groups of _ hr _ is independent of    @xmath6 .",
    "origin of the seed photon to compton cloud : :    the  comptonized component is also characterized by the seed photon .",
    "the seed photons is considered to be soft photons from ns surface    and/or disk photons in soft state ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the difference would not affect the distribution of _ hr _ , because the    _ hr _ is almost constant over the large range of luminosity of    ( 750)@xmath19 erg  s@xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we propose that the difference between two groups would be due to the size solid angle from the photon source of the compton cloud . if the optical depth is similar , the difference of the solid angle is reflected . when the distance between the photon source and the compton cloud is similar ,",

    "although the location is controversial , the size of compton cloud would change with the amount of accretion flow . however , there is no correlation between the observed luminosity and the _ hr _ between the two groups . here",

    "although the magnetic field of ns in ns - lmxb is considered to be weak , in some cases the effect of the magnetic field is taken into account ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the soft state ,",

    "we also presented the hardness``normalized luminosity '' diagrams for individual sources in figure  [ fig10 ] .    according to the fact that the frequency of the upper khz qpo is related to the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of an accretion disk ,",
    "@xcite suggested that the disappearance of khz qpo at high luminosities may be related to the disappearance of the magnetosphere at the time when @xmath24 reaches @xmath29 .",

    "when @xmath24 is larger than the isco , the accretion disk would be stopped and spread at @xmath24 , and then the relatively large compton cloud would be created .",
