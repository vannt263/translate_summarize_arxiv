    "the phase space of nonlinear conservative hamiltonian systems can present regions of regular , mixed and chaotic motion , depending on the nonlinear parameter .",
    "the regular region is characterized by the complete absence of chaotic trajectories while the chaotic region by the absence of regular trajectories , with exceptions of measure zero stable orbits .",
    "the mixed regions on the other hand , contains simultaneously the regular and chaotic motion ( or quasi - regular ) and everything becomes complicated @xcite : the positions of regular structures , their size distribution , exit times , the shapes of the structures boundaries and the penetration inside them which is possible in higher dimensions .",
    "weak chaos occurs in the mixed region where an approximately even competition between the regular and chaotic dynamics occurs @xcite . in @xmath0dimensional conservative problems ( @xmath1dimensional phase space )",
    "the dynamics can be described by using the technique of poincar surfaces of section ( pss ) . however , for high - dimensional systems this technique is only partially useful due to the restriction of plots to @xmath0 and @xmath2dimensions , which makes it almost impossible to construct adequate psss which allow to describe the whole dynamics . beside that , @xmath2dimensional plots of high - dimensional systems are fairly unsatisfactory projections from the whole system .",
    "a recent work proposes visualization of classical structures using phase space slices @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use lyapunov quantifiers which decide if a trajectory is chaotic or not . in the mixed region",
    "stickiness @xcite affects the convergence of finite time lyapunov exponents ( ftles ) , but they contain essential informations about the properties of the regular structures which live in the high - dimensional phase space .",
    "the properties of regular structures have been addressed on the same constant energy @xcite , by studying their dimensionality @xcite , and the almost invariant sets in continuous problems @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "the purpose of the present work is not to describe the invariant structures itself , but to quantify their effect on the dynamics .",
    "as explained below , it turns out that ftles are very suitable to do the job in the mixed regions .",
    "any dynamical evolution of the system depends on the starting point in phase space and on the shape and number of regular structures of its surroundings .",
    "since ftles are usually strongly dependent on the initial conditions ( ics ) and on the sticky motion , they can be used to quantify the amount of regular motion in high - dimensional phase spaces .",
    "it would be nice to check the stickiness influence on the smaller alignment index @xcite which rapidly distinguish between ordered and chaotic trajectories in hamiltonian flows .",
    "a very appropriate way to quantify the sticky motion is by analyzing higher order cummulants of the ftles distribution .",
    "this was proposed @xcite for the standard map and applied @xcite to higher dimensions in conservative non - hamiltonian systems .",
    "it was found @xcite by this technique that for @xmath3 and @xmath4 phase space dimensions , conservative coupled standard maps with unidirectional local coupling can be characterized of being chaotic , quasi - regular or regular .",
    "in addition , for some values of the nonlinear parameter in the quasi - regular region , stickiness is shown to affect _ all _ unstable directions _ simultaneously _ and by the _",
    "same _ amount , which is quantified by the cummulants mentioned above .",
    "this remarkable property was named _",
    "behavior @xcite and its main property is that regular structures in phase space `` attract '' the chaotic trajectories by the amount in all unstable directions .",
    "once the chaotic trajectory is attracted , it remains sticked to the regular structure and then presents the clustering behavior observed @xcite in conservative maps .",
    "but the essential new property from the common behavior is that the rate of attraction of the chaotic trajectory into the regular structure is equal in different unstable directions .",
    "the question remains if the common motion is a general property found also in hamiltonian and symplectic systems , or maybe it depends on the particular choice of the coupling ?",
    "in order to answer this question and to understand better mixed phase spaces , in this work we extend our method to hamiltonian systems with global and local couplings and compare the results . the existence of an additional constant of motion , besides the total energy , allows for a clear interpretation of results .",
    "the paper is divided in the following way . in section [ model ]",
    "the local and global coupled maps models used in this work are presented and in section [ method ] we summary the main properties of the ftles distribution in order to detect stickiness . in section [ results ]",
    "we present and discuss the results which are summarized in the conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the model we investigate is conservative with an additional constant of motion .",
    "it describes @xmath5 particles coupled on a unit circle , where the state of each particle is defined by its position @xmath6 and its conjugate momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the lattice of @xmath5 coupled maps is written as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 can be local or global coupling as discussed next . the local coupling ( lc ) is defined accordingly to    @xmath10\\right.\\cr              & & \\left . \\right.\\\\          - & & \\left.\\sin[2\\pi(x_t^{(i)}-x_t^{(i-1)})]\\right\\ } ,   \\label{gc}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 .",
    "we considered periodic boundary conditions @xmath12 .",
    "some properties of this model were already investigated numerically in @xcite . for the global coupling ( gc )",
    "we have    @xmath13 ,   \\label{lc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is simultaneously the nonlinear parameter and the coupling strength between distinct sites . for @xmath15 the interaction term @xmath9 between two particles @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "is attractive @xcite .",
    "both models have the total momentum @xmath18 as a conservative quantity and they were extensively studied in @xcite , which characterized the system by the existence of an ordering process called cluster , which will be discussed later .",
    "in this section we summarize the method used to detect stickiness from the ftles distribution .",
    "sticky motion reduces the local ftle along a chaotic trajectory .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ n4-ftle ] , where the ftles are plotted as a function of time . in this case simulations",
    "were realized for the gc with @xmath19 , @xmath20 [ fig .",
    "[ n4-ftle](a ) ] and @xmath21 [ fig .",
    "[ n4-ftle](b ) ] . after the last iteration the corresponding ftles distribution over initial conditions is plotted ( in red ) . as time increases the local ftle increases for a chaotic trajectory , but",
    "since it may touch or penetrate regular structures in the phase space , sticky motion occurs and the local ftle decreases ( see green decreasing lines ) .",
    "when this trajectory leaves the sticky region , the local ftle starts to increase again .",
    "thus , those chaotic trajectories affected by the sticky motion will have smaller values of their ftles at the last iteration .",
    "this induces a small tail to the right in the distribution of the ftles [ see fig .",
    "[ n4-ftle](a ) ] , and it becomes asymmetric .",
    "therefore , while for intermediate values of @xmath14 such asymmetric fat tails are expected , for larger @xmath14 values , where a totally chaotic motion occurs , a gaussian distribution for the ftles is expected .        for small values of @xmath14",
    "a large amount of regular motion in phase space is expected and thus strong sticky motion .",
    "this can be observed , for example , in fig .",
    "[ n4-ftle](b ) for @xmath21 . in such cases",
    "the ftles distribution is not gaussian - like and it can be multimodal .",
    "this is a very complicated region to be characterized in general since only a tiny portion of ics lead to chaotic motion , and these are responsible for the arnold diffusion and produce arnold stripes in the _ mixed _ plots ics _ versus _ nonlinear parameter @xcite .    for the cases where the ftle distribution is a gaussian - like function , higher cummulants from this distribution are very efficient to detect tiny sticky motion , as was shown for the standard map @xcite and for high - dimensional conservative systems @xcite .",
    "here we show results determining the skewness , or the asymmetry of the ftles distribution .",
    "the _ skewness _ is defined by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the relative variance and @xmath24 is the local ftle .",
    "for @xmath25 we have the regular gaussian distribution , expected for a chaotic system . since sticky motion usually reduces the ftles the asymmetry of the distribution leads to @xmath26 .",
    "thus for any @xmath26 sticky motion is expected .",
    "the flatness ( forth cummulant ) could also be used instead the skewness , but results are similar . for more details",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite , where it was shown that the variance of the ftles distribution is not that efficient to detect sticky motion as the flatness and skewness .",
    "the transition from the integrable case ( @xmath27 ) to the weakly chaotic one depends on the kind of coupling between sites . as mentioned in the introduction , in the weakly chaotic region everything is complicated @xcite : the positions of the regular structures , their size distribution , the shapes of the structures boundaries and the penetration inside them due to higher dimensions . as demonstrated above , the method of higher cummulants of the ftles distribution",
    "is not appropriate for too small @xmath14 values , where the amount of regular motion in phase space is much larger than the chaotic one . in order to understand better the integrable to weakly chaotic transition we analyze ftles in _",
    "mixed _ plots as an additional tool .",
    "such plots are very useful to study bifurcation diagrams in conservative systems @xcite .",
    "we start considering the case @xmath19 for which @xmath28 symmetric ftles exist , two of them are exactly zero due to the conservation of the total momentum . an interesting way to describe the complicated global dynamics dependence on initial conditions , and thus the sticky effect , is shown in the _ mixed _ plot @xmath29 presented in fig .  [ n4-glob](a ) . other dynamical quantities ( @xmath30 , with @xmath31 could also be used instead @xmath32 ) .",
    "colors are the largest ftles after @xmath33 iterations .",
    "initial conditions are chosen on the invariant structure @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this plot shows , as a function of @xmath14 , which initial conditions generate zero or positive ftles .     with the ( b ) skewness @xmath36 for @xmath19 and the gc coupling ( [ gc ] ) .",
    "continuous line for @xmath37 , dashed for @xmath38 and dotted line for @xmath39 . ]    a rich variety of structures is observed .",
    "essentially two distinct larger regions of motions are observed and demarked in the plot as : ( a ) where ftles are smaller and ( b ) where ftles are larger . in between the ftles mix themselves along complicated and apparently fractal structures . for @xmath40 ftles",
    "go to zero inside region ( a ) .",
    "however there are some stripes , which emanate from @xmath41 for which ftles are larger .",
    "two larger stripes are born close to @xmath42 and growth symmetrically around this point as @xmath14 increases .",
    "such stripes are intervals of initial conditions inside which arnold diffusion occurs and are thus named as _",
    "arnold _ or _ chaotic _ stripes .",
    "they exist for many intervals of initial conditions , as described in more details in @xcite , where their apparency was also observed in open billiards with rounded corner / borders .    along the line",
    "@xmath43 the dynamics is almost regular for @xmath44 , becoming chaotic for larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "this picture shows us clearly that for the same @xmath14 value , different regions of the phase space ( in this case @xmath32 ) have distinct ftles .",
    "smaller ftles are related to those initial conditions which started exactly on a regular trajectory , or on a chaotic trajectory which touched for a finite time the regular structures from the high - dimensional phase space .",
    "such regular structures can be global ( as the invariant @xmath45 ) , local , or collective ordered states which live in the high - dimensional phase space .",
    "as trajectories itinerate between ordered and random states , the regular structures affect locally the ftles inducing sticky motion , so that the corresponding ftle decreases .",
    "thus each point in the mixed plot from fig .",
    "[ n4-glob](a ) which has smaller ftles for a fixed @xmath14 value , is necessarily related to sticky motion .",
    "this is confirmed by comparing fig .",
    "[ n4-glob](a ) and ( b ) , where it is possible to associate stickiness @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ n4-glob](b ) with the existence of initial conditions which generate close to zero ftles in fig .",
    "[ n4-glob](a ) .",
    "figure [ n4-glob](b ) shows the skewness related to the distribution for the three remaining positive ftles as a function of @xmath14 for the gc . in this case @xmath33 random equally distributed initial conditions are used and @xmath47 iterations .",
    "for very small values of @xmath48 , we checked that the ftles distributions are not gaussian - like , so that @xmath36 is not well defined . for @xmath49 it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ n4-glob](b ) that @xmath50 for all three ftles . thus all ftles are equally affected by the regular structures leaving to sticky motion .",
    "small changes between distinct @xmath36 are observed close to @xmath51 but since @xmath52 , no relevant sticky motion is expected to occur anymore and the dynamics can be characterized as totally chaotic for @xmath53 .    we can identify a clear transition between three dynamical regions : strongly _ regular _ for @xmath54 , where @xmath36 is probably not well defined and many initial conditions generate small ftles ; strongly _ mixed _ for @xmath55 where many sticky regions are observed @xmath46 and ; the _ chaotic _",
    "one for @xmath56 where @xmath52 .",
    "interesting to mention is that in the mixed region we observe the common motion , where all ftles are equally affected by the regular structures in the high - dimensional phase space .    to compare our results with the ordering states shown in @xcite , we firstly write down the order parameter    @xmath57}. \\label{z}\\ ] ]    from this parameter it is possible to distinguish essentially three motions @xcite : ( i ) when @xmath58 , _",
