    "it is generally accepted that atomic nuclei are many - body systems in which correlations beyond the mean - field or hartree - fock picture play a significant role .",
    "therefore it has always been a point of experimental and theoretical studies to find observables , which reflect these correlations in a unambiguous way . in this sense , the simultaneous study of density and momentum distributions in nuclei seems to be a sensitive test of nuclear models and may provide information on the correlations between the interacting nucleons@xcite .",
    "density and momentum distributions are one - body properties and therefore can be calculated from the single - particle spectral function which contains all the information on the single - particle structure of nuclei .",
    "recent proton knock - out experiments employing the @xmath0 reaction have shown that correlations between nucleons are responsible for a reduction of the spectroscopic strength of valence hole states with respect to the uncorrelated mean - field values and for the fragmentation of the strength over a large excitation energy domain of the remaining nucleus@xcite .",
    "the modern @xmath0 performed e.g. with the mami facility@xcite in mainz or at nikhef@xcite in amsterdam do not only provide information on the global spectroscopic strength but also yield results on the high - momentum components of the spectral function .",
    "the effects of correlations on the momentum and energy distribution of the single particle strength , in particular for these high momentum values , is presently a subject of discussion@xcite .",
    "most of the investigations have been performed for light nuclei@xcite or infinite nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "results for heavier nuclei are typically derived from investigations of nuclear matter assuming a local density approximation @xcite .",
    "a question that has attracted a lot of attention concerns the possibility of describing a given momentum distribution by means of an independent particle model . in the ipm the nucleus",
    "is considered to be a system of nucleons moving without residual interaction in a mean - field or single - particle potential . in this case",
    "the nuclear wave function is represented by a single slater determinant .",
    "one way to clarify this point is by studying the natural orbits ( @xmath1)@xcite .",
    "these wave functions and their associated eigenvalues ( @xmath2 ) ( natural occupation numbers ) are obtained by diagonalizing the one - body density matrix for the ground state of the a particle system .",
    "therefore the one - body density matrix of the correlated system can be expressed in terms of these occupation numbers @xmath2 and the corresponding natural orbits @xmath3 by @xmath4 as the one body density matrix is diagonal in the @xmath1 representation , this basis appears to contain the most suitable single - particle wave functions for the calculation of the expectation value of a general one - body operator .",
    "in particular , if the total wave function of the system is a unique slater determinant build with single - particle wave functions then the natural orbits coincide with those wave functions and the natural occupations are equal to unity .",
    "the deviations of this ideal situation indicate the impossibility to obtain the one - body density matrix from a single slater determinant .",
    "one can say that the effect of correlations in the calculation of one - body observables are smallest when using the @xmath1 basis ; for example , the depletion of the fermi sea is smallest in this basis@xcite .    performing a microscopic calculation of the one - body green function for @xmath5o we have recently demonstrated@xcite that the nucleon - nucleon correlations induced by the short - range and the tensor components of a realistic interaction@xcite yield an enhancement of the momentum distribution at high momenta as compared to the hartree - fock description .",
    "this enhancement , however , is only obtained after integrating over all excitation energies of the @xmath6 particle system . on the other hand , a momentum distribution very similar to the one derived in the hartree - fock approximation",
    "is observed if one restricts the energy integration to the states of lowest energy for each set of orbital angular momentum @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "does this imply that correlation effects are visible in @xmath0 experiments to the low - lying states in @xmath6 nucleus only in terms of the spectroscopic factors , which are reduced as compared to the independent particle model ? in order to discuss this question , we will analyze the results of the single - particle green function obtained with the method described in @xcite in terms of natural orbits and their occupation numbers .",
    "this analysis will also allow us to study the effects of correlations on the local density distribution @xmath9 and other one - body observables in @xmath5o .",
    "after this introduction , the techniques to evaluate the single - particle green function , the density matrix and the natural orbits are briefly described in the next section .",
    "the discussion of our numerical results are presented in section 3 and the main conclusions of the work are summarized in the final section 4 .",
    "the aim of our investigation is the analysis of the single - particle density matrix @xmath10 , which is defined in a basis of appropriate single - particle states @xmath11 by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the correlated ground state of the nucleus and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) define the single - particle creation ( annihilation ) operators for the basis considered . for a nucleus like @xmath5o with a ground state of angular momentum @xmath16",
    "the density matrix can be separated into sub - matrices of given orbital angular momentum @xmath7 , total angular momentum @xmath8 and an isospin quantum number . in our discussion",
    "we will ignore the effects of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this means that the results obtained in nuclei with @xmath17 = @xmath18 are identical for protons and neutrons and therefore we will drop the quantum number referring to the isospin . using e.g. the momentum representation and performing a partial wave decomposition , the density matrix can be written as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 referring to the `` good '' quantum numbers of angular momentum and @xmath21 , @xmath22 define the absolute values of the momenta for the single - particle states @xmath11 above .    within the green function approach@xcite this density matrix can be evaluated from the imaginary part of the single - particle green function by integrating @xmath23 where the energy variable @xmath24 corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state of the @xmath25 particle system and the various energies of all the states in the @xmath6 system ( negative @xmath24 with large absolute value correspond to high excitation energies in the remaining system ) and @xmath26 is the fermi energy .    the single - particle green function @xmath27 or propagator is obtained from a solution of the dyson equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 refers to a hartree - fock propagator and @xmath30 represents contributions to the real and imaginary part of the irreducible self - energy , which go beyond the hartree - fock approximation of the nucleon self - energy used to derive @xmath29 . the definition and evaluation of the hartree - fock contribution as well as the calculation of @xmath31",
    "will be discussed below .",
    "the calculation of the self - energy is performed in terms of a @xmath32-matrix which is obtained as a solution of the bethe - goldstone equation for nuclear matter choosing for the bare nn interaction the one - boson - exchange potential @xmath33 defined by machleidt ( @xcite , tab.a.2 ) .",

    "this choice for the oscillator length corresponds to an oscillator energy of @xmath46 = 14 mev .",
    "therefore the oscillator functions are quite appropriate to describe the wave functions of the bound single - particle states in @xmath5o .",

    "this is true for the example of the @xmath104 states displayed in the table but also for states with @xmath105 , which are not given explicitly here . in order to understand this feature",
    "we must recall that the occupation probability for e.g. natural orbits with @xmath96 symmetry in @xmath5o , reflects the probability to generate in knock - out reactions states of the @xmath6 particle system @xmath106 the resulting state @xmath107 is a one - hole state with respect to the correlated ground state of @xmath5o , it does not contain , however , any component with one hole in the @xmath96 orbit with respect to the hf ground state configuration for @xmath5o .",

    "this probability , however , is not affected by single - particle energies of the @xmath96 orbits but rather determined by the number and energies of these ( n+1)-hole n - particle configurations and the probability of these configurations to be generated by applying @xmath109 to the correlated ground state @xmath110 . keeping this in mind the occupation probabilities of the natural orbits with @xmath101 are easily understood .",

    ", we have calculated the square radii of these orbits @xmath114 and show some typical results in table [ tab : rad ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that the resulting @xmath115 do not increase with the number of nodes , i.e.  the value of @xmath93 , as one expects from single - particle wave functions in a potential .",

    "the results for the natural orbits are much less increasing with @xmath93 , in the case of the @xmath118 orbits the values obtained for @xmath119 are even smaller than the corresponding results for @xmath120 .",
    "this means that the natural orbits with @xmath121 yield a density distribution much more localized in the center of the nucleus than would be obtained from corresponding single - particle wave functions for a local potential .",
    "furthermore it is remarkable that the values of @xmath116 obtained for the @xmath120 natural orbits with angular momenta @xmath122 and @xmath123 are smaller then the radii calculated for the natural orbits with large occupation probability and @xmath118 .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the @xmath124 natural orbits are dominated by the quasihole contribution to the density matrix ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : skoqh ] ) .",

    "therefore it can also be understood that radii of natural orbits with @xmath101 , which do not contain any quasihole contributions , can be smaller than those for @xmath118 .    from a more general point of view",
    ", however , one may say that for all those orbits , which are occupied within the naive shell - model and therefore yield a quasihole state , the radial wave function for the natural orbit with largest occupation probability ( @xmath126 ) is very similar to the wave function of the quasihole state .",
    "furthermore , both wave functions are very close to the corresponding single - particle wave functions obtained in the hf approach ( see figure [ fig : qhfno ] ) .    summarizing this part of the discussion we find that for a given @xmath20 the continuum contribution to the density matrix ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : skob ] ) yields smaller radii than the corresponding quasihole wave function .",
    "even if we sum the contributions of all natural orbits @xmath127 the result is smaller than just the radius of the quasihole state ( see table [ tab : rad ] ) . in order to obtain the total radius of the nucleus one has to sum over all partial waves @xmath20 ,",
    "multiply each @xmath128 by the total occupation of these orbits @xmath129 times the degeneracy ( @xmath130 ) and divide by the total particle number . due to the depletion of states with @xmath131 accompanied by a small occupation of orbits with @xmath101 one obtains a value for the total radius ( r=2.55 fm ) , which is only slightly below the result obtained in the hartree - fock approach ( r=2.59 fm ) .",
    "these features are also displayed in figure [ fig : todens ] , where the local density distribution obtained in hf ( long dashes ) is compared to the total density distribution ( solid line ) .",
    "also we present the contribution to the total density distribution coming from partial waves with @xmath132 ( short dashes ) .",
    "one finds that the depletion of states with small @xmath7 ( in particular @xmath133 ) yields a reduction of the density in the center of the nucleus .",
    "the difference between the density distribution from the quasi - hole approximation ( dashed - dotted line ) and the total result is due to the continuum contribution to the density .      in the preceding discussion",
    "it has been pointed out already that the natural orbits with occupation probabilities close to one are dominated by the quasihole contribution .",
    "this means that features of these natural orbits are explored in knock - out experiments like @xmath0 populating the states of low energy in the daughter nucleus . in the following",
    "we would like to discuss the question , to which extent the analysis of experiments with large missing energies , leading to high excitation energies in the residual @xmath108 system , exhibits the properties of the natural orbits with smaller occupation probabilities .    for that purpose",

    "in fact , the overlap of the natural orbit displayed in the left part of figure [ fig : conti ] has an overlap with the quasihole wave function of the @xmath133 state , which is as large as 0.997 .",
    "this means that also the continuum part of the density matrix is characterized by a dominant natural orbit very similar to the quasihole state .    in a next step we split the energy integration of eq.([eq : skob ] ) into 2 parts",
    "the first interval ranges from @xmath135 mev to the threshold of the @xmath136 continuum , while the second interval covers energies from @xmath137 to @xmath135 mev . restricting the energy integration to one of these two intervals",
    "we can study either the single - particle density to be observed in knock - out experiments with very large missing energies ( interval 2 ) or at medium missing energies . eigenvalues ( i.e.  occupation probabilities @xmath2 ) and eigenvectors ( natural orbits ) of these parts of the density matrix are also presented in table [ tab : conti ] and figure [ fig : conti ] , respectively .",
    "the natural orbits originating from the energy interval 2 ( large missing energies ) are more localized in the center of the nucleus than those derived from the energy interval which corresponds to lower excitation energies in the residual system .",
    "the overlaps of the various natural orbits with the same @xmath93 , however , are still large ( typically larger than 0.95 ) .",
    "what seems to be more significant is the relative importance of the different energy intervals for the various natural orbits .",
    "the occupation of the @xmath120 natural orbit mainly originates from the energy interval 1 , whereas the natural orbits with @xmath93 equal to 2 or larger , collect the main part of the occupation from energies below -100 mev in the integral of eq.([eq : skob ] ) .",
    "the same features are also observed in the other partial waves as can be seen from the results displayed in table [ tab : exspec ] . in this table",
    "we give for various partial waves @xmath20 the occupation probabilities of the natural orbits derived from the total density matrix , split into the contribution resulting from the quasihole part of the density matrix ( denoted by @xmath138 ) and the continuum part ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "these results show again that the @xmath126 natural orbits are dominated by the quasihole component of the density matrix , while the other natural orbits mainly originate from the continuum contribution to the single - particle density .",
    "furthermore we have listed for each natural orbit , @xmath92 , the mean value for the energy in the 2h1p continuum ( see also eq.([eq : skob ] ) ) @xmath140 in this equation @xmath141 stands for the single - particle green function in the `` box - basis '' of eqs.([eq : boxbas ] ) - ( [ eq : nbox ] ) and @xmath142 denote the expansion coefficients of the natural orbits in this basis .    inspecting these mean values for the energies one finds that the absolute values of these energies increase with @xmath93 , the index of the natural orbits chosen with respect to the occupation probability .",
    "this implies that the natural orbits , which have radial wave functions with a larger number of nodes ( @xmath121 , see figure [ fig : natr ] ) , `` collect '' the occupation at more negative energies than the natural orbits with @xmath126 .",
    "also we list in table [ tab : exspec ] the continuum contribution to the expectation values for the kinetic energies of the natural orbits @xmath143 also the expectation values @xmath144 increase with @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath93=1 they are slightly larger than the corresponding expectation values for the quasihole states .",
    "this is in line with the observation made above that the continuum part of the density matrix tends to decrease the radius of the natural orbit with @xmath120 as compared to the quasihole state .",
    "the expectation values for @xmath93 larger than one increase very drastically with @xmath93 since the corresponding natural orbits contain strong components with high momenta as can bee seen from the radial shapes in figure [ fig : natr ] .    concluding this part of the discussion we find that the natural orbits with @xmath93 larger than 1 ( indicating their small occupations ) represent the high momentum components in the single - particle density and originate mainly from the imaginary part of the green function at very negative energies .",
    "this means that the features of these natural orbits might be explored by analyzing knock - out experiments with large missing energies .    the occupation probabilities and expectation values listed in table [ tab : exspec ]",
    "can also be used to calculate the total energy of the nucleus @xmath5o via the `` koltun sum rule '' @xmath145 \\label{eq : koltun}\\ ] ] the quasihole contribution to the total energy is calculated in terms of the quasihole energy @xmath146 ( see eq.([eq : qhequ ] ) ) , the kinetic energy for the quasihole states @xmath147 and the spectroscopic factors @xmath148 ( see eq.([eq : qhs ] ) ) .",
    "it is remarkable that this quasihole contribution yields only around 37 percent of the total energy although the quasihole part of the single - particle density is responsible for 89 percent of the total particle number .",
    "the largest contribution to the energy in eq.([eq : koltun ] ) originates from the continuum part of the natural orbits with @xmath120 .",
    "these states contribute more than 58 percent of the total energy although the particle number of these contributions is only around 9 percent .",
    "the remaining part of the total energy @xmath149 , which is -3 mev out of the total calculated @xmath150 ( see also @xcite ) , is due to the natural orbits with @xmath93 larger than 1 .",
    "it is worth repeating that a large part of the density matrix can be described in terms of one natural orbit for each partial wave .",
    "these contributions of the @xmath120 natural orbits account for 97.9 percent of the total particle number and for 96 percent of the total energy .",
    "therefore the description of the single - particle density matrix in terms of these natural orbits with largest occupation probabilities should be sufficient for the calculation of many single - particle observables .",
    "it should be kept in mind that already this description in terms of one natural orbit in each partial wave is beyond the mean - field approximation : ( i ) it allows for a depletion of orbits , which are completely occupied in the mean - field approach , and occupation of partial waves , which are not occupied in the mean - field picture . (",
    "ii ) this approach takes into account the most important part of the spectral distribution of the single - particle density matrix ( see the contributions to the energy in eq.([eq : koltun ] ) ) . the restriction to the natural orbits with @xmath93=1 ,",
    "however , should not be sufficient to obtain a reliable description of the high - momentum components in the single - particle density matrix .",
    "these components are described mainly in terms of the natural orbits with smaller occupation probability .",
    "properties of the correlated wave function for the nucleus @xmath5o , which includes the effects of short - range correlations derived from a realistic nn interaction by means of the green function method@xcite , have been analyzed in terms of natural orbits .",
    "it turns out that the single - particle density matrix can very well be described in terms of a few natural orbits for each partial wave @xmath20 .",
    "if one restricts the representation of the density matrix in eq.([eq : natorb ] ) to only one orbit per partial wave ( the orbit with largest occupation probability @xmath2 , here referred to as the @xmath120 natural orbits ) , one obtains a density matrix , which accounts already for 97.9 percent of the total particle number .",
    "these @xmath120 natural orbits have a large overlap with the wave functions of the quasihole states as well as the hartree - fock ( hf ) single - particle wave functions for those orbits , which are occupied within the mean - field approximation .    at first sight also",
    "the natural orbits in partial waves , which are unoccupied in the hf approximation , and the natural orbits with small occupation probabilities ( @xmath121 ) look like single - particle wave functions for a nucleons in an excited state of a single - particle potential .",
    "a closer inspection shows , however , that the radii for these `` excited '' orbits are much smaller than those obtained for a motion within a single - particle orbit .",
    "these @xmath121 natural orbits mainly originate from the single - particle green function at large negative energies ( @xmath151 - 100 mev ) .",
    "although the occupation of these orbits is much smaller than those with @xmath93=1 , these orbits describe the high - momentum components of the single - particle density matrix . therefore in order to study these `` excited '' natural orbits or the high - momentum components of the single - particle density",
    ", one has to analyze nucleon knock - out experiments with large missing energy .    for the understanding of the bulk properties of nuclei , like binding energy and radius",
    ", it seems to be a good approximation to restrict the study to natural orbits with maximal occupation probability .",
    "it is not sufficient , however , to restrict the evaluation of the energy according to the `` koltun sum rule '' ( eq.[eq : koltun ] ) to the contributions of the quasihole states .",
    "the main contributions arise from the single - particle green function at energies deep in the 2h1p continuum . in order to improve the present studies towards a self - consistent treatment of the single - particle green function",
    ", it should be a good approximation to describe this green function in terms of the natural orbits with largest occupation probabilities .",
