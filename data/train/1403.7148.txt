    "we can thus get a very accurate analytical expression @xmath173 for the example in the main text , @xmath174 and @xmath175 , we have @xmath176 and @xmath177.$ ]    the micromotion corrected equilibrium position is @xmath178 and should be identified with @xmath179 around which we expand the coulomb potential in the first place .",
    "thus we should determine them self - consistently . taking the relative motion in the manuscript as an example",
    ", since both @xmath180 and @xmath181 are functions of @xmath179 , then the self - consistent equation @xmath182 gives the correct @xmath179 . with the iterative method it typically takes only a few iterations to converge to the correct value when starting from a proper initial value of @xmath179 .",
    "here we offer an approximate treatment of motional integrals .",
    "we notice that the secular frequency @xmath37 and the micromotion frequency @xmath146 are well separated , i.e. @xmath183 .",
    "this means quantities with characteristic frequency @xmath37 or below stay constant within one period of micromotion .",
    "so we can perform the time integral in two steps : we first integrate over one period of the micromotion , obtaining a slowly varying integrand , which we then integrate again . by doing this",
    "we will show that the dominant effect of micromotion is to modulate the effective rabi frequency .",
    "notice that the integrals @xmath184 can be reduced to the form below ( ignoring micromotion frequencies @xmath185 with @xmath186 ) @xmath187 where @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 are all real slowly varying functions within one period of micromotion @xmath194 .",

    ", the micromotion gives rise to slowly varying modulation factors , @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "moreover in @xmath196 the phase of the original integrand is also shifted , @xmath203 . for the actual experimental system",
    ", the term @xmath196 contributes much less than the @xmath195 to the target integral @xmath204 , due to the much smaller coefficient of the micromotion component than that of the secular component in @xmath38 .",
    "so in leading order , micromotion reduces the laser rabi frequency seen by the ion by a factor on the order of @xmath201 .",

    "<S> two or three dimensional paul traps can confine a large number of ions forming a wigner crystal , which would provide an ideal architecture for scalable quantum computation except for the micromotion , an issue that is widely believed to be the killer for high fidelity quantum gates . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate the principle of the gate design under micromotion using two ions in a quadrupole paul trap as an example . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed micromotion quantum gates can be extended to the many ion case , paving a new way for scalable trapped ion quantum computation .    </S>",
    "<S> trapped ions constitute one of the most promising systems for realization of quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all the quantum information processing experiments so far are done in linear paul traps , where the ions form a one - dimensional ( 1d ) crystal along the trap axis @xcite . in this configuration , the external radio - frequency ( r.f . ) </S>",
    "<S> paul trap can be well approximated by a static trapping potential with negligible micromotion , which is believed to be critical for design of high fidelity quantum gates . </S>",
    "<S> however , in term of scalability , the linear configuration is not the optimal one for realization of large scale quantum computation : first , the number of ions in a linear trap is limited @xcite ; and second , the linear configuration is not convenient for realization of fault - tolerant quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> the effective qubit coupling in a large ion chain is dominated by the dipole interaction , which is only good for short - range quantum gates because of its fast decay with distance . in a linear chain with short range quantum gates , </S>",
    "<S> the error threshold for fault tolerance is very tough and hard to be met experimentally @xcite .    from a scalability point of view </S>",
    "<S> , two ( 2d ) or three dimensional ( 3d ) paul traps would be much better for quantum computation compared with a linear chain . in a 2d or 3d trap , one can hold a large number of qubits with a high error threshold for fault tolerance , in the range of a percent level , even with just the nearest neighbor quantum gates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thousands to millions of ions have been successfully trapped to form 2d or 3d wigner crystals in a paul trap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a critical problem to use this system for quantum computation , i.e. , the micromotion issue . in the 2d or 3d configuration </S>",
    "<S> , micromotion can not be compensated , and the magnitude of micromotion for each ion can be significantly beyond the optical wavelength ( i.e. , outside of the lamb - dicke region ) . as the micromotion is from the driving force of the paul trap , it can not be laser cooled . </S>",
    "<S> the messy and large - magnitude micromotion well beyond the lamb - dicke condition is believed to be a critical hurdle for design of entangling quantum gate operations in this architecture .    in this paper , we show that the micromotion surprisingly is not an obstacle at all for design of high - fidelity quantum gates . </S>",
    "<S> when the ions form a crystal in a time - dependent paul trap , they will be described by a set of mathieu equations . </S>",
    "<S> we solve exactly the quantum mathieu equations in general with an inhomogeneous driving term and find that the micromotion is dominated by a well - defined classical trajectory with no quantum fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> this large classical motion is far outside of the lamb - dicke region , however , it does not lead to infidelity of quantum gates if it is appropriately taken into account in the gate design . </S>",

    "<S> this part of motion still satisfies the lamb - dicke condition at the doppler temperature , which is routine to achieve for experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we use two ions in a quadrupole trap , which have large micromotion , as an example to show the principle of the gate design , and give the explicit gate scheme both in the slow and the fast gate regions using multi - segment laser pulses @xcite , with the intrinsic gate infidelity arbitrarily approaching zero under large micromotion . </S>",
    "<S> we finally give a breif discussion of the general procedure of the gate design under micromotion , which in principle can work for any number of ions , with important implication for large - scale quantum computation .    </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate the general feature of micromotion in a paul trap and the principle of the gate design under micromotion , we consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) anisotropic quadrupole trap with a time dependent potential @xmath0 from an electric field oscillating at the r.f . </S>",

    "<S> it is well known that the solution to the classical mathieu equation@xmath30 is a combination of mathieu sine @xmath31 and mathieu cosine @xmath32 functions , which reduce to the conventional sine and cosine functions when micromotion is neglected @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the solution to the position operator @xmath35 takes the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the oscillator length .    </S>",
    "<S> the above solution gives a complete description of the center - of - mass motion with the operator @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the secular frequency of the center of mass mode . </S>",
