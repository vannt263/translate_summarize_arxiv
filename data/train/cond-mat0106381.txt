    "the behavior of systems with long - range interactions is often different from those considered in traditional thermodynamics . as an example we take self gravitating systems , i.e. particle ensembles with purely attractive @xmath3 interactions .",
    "it is known that such systems exhibit collapse , sometimes called a zero - order phase transition , when the energy in the microcanonical ensemble ( me ) or the temperature in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) drop below a certain critical value @xmath4 or @xmath5 , respectively @xcite . during such a transition , the corresponding thermodynamic potentials ( entropy in the me or free energy in the ce ) exhibit a discontinuous jump .",
    "if the interaction between the particles is purely attractive and no short - range cutoff is introduced , then the discontinuous jump is infinite and the entropy and free energy go to @xmath2 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "this makes all normal ( noncollapsed ) states of the self - attractive system metastable with respect to such a collapse ; the collapse energy @xmath4 is in fact an energy below which the metastable state ceases to exist . if , on the other hand , some form of short - range cutoff is introduced , the entropy and free energy jumps are finite . in this case as a result of the collapse , the system goes into a nonsingular state with a dense core , the precise nature of which depends on the details of the short - range behavior of the potential .",
    "then only the normal states which are in some interval of energies above the collapse point are metastable with respect to such a transition ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "sketch of an entropy vs. energy plot for a system with gravitational - like collapse .",
    "the entropy of the normal ( non - collapsed ) state is shown by a solid line , the entropies of the two collapsed states for different cutoff radio @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are shown by dashed lines .",
    "the entropies of the two collapsed states intersect the entropy of the normal state at energies @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "there is an energy @xmath12 for which both collapsed and normal system have the same entropy ( cf .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 in fig .",
    "1 ) ; above this energy the collapsed state becomes metastable and at some higher energy it ceases to exist @xcite .",
    "it is possible to regard the energy @xmath12 as that where a true phase transition occurs . when the effective cutoff vanishes , such phase transition energy @xmath12 increases to infinity , so that without a cutoff all the finite energy states are metastable @xcite .",
    "however , the value of @xmath12 is highly sensitive to the details of the short - range cutoff . on the contrary ,",
    "the collapse energy @xmath4 depends on the long - range part of the interparticle interactions and is almost unaffected by a cutoff , provided that it is sufficiently short - range . since the collapse phenomena carry most of the information about the peculiarities of the phase behavior of the system caused by the long - range interactions , they usually gain the most attention , considering then a phase transition at @xmath12 as a mere artifact of an often auxiliary cutoff .    while these rather elaborate studies of gravitational collapse have usually been motivated by cosmological applications and were performed solely for an @xmath3 potential , a natural question is , what happens if the particles interact via an attractive potential with arbitrary @xmath13 .",
    "it has been noticed before that in systems with nonintegrable interactions , i.e. when @xmath13 is less than the dimensionality of the space , first order phase transitions occur differently in the me than in the ce , even for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , in the examples considered in the literature , the potential energy was always bounded from below ( usually by putting the system on a lattice ) , allowing only for normal first - order phase transitions and excluding any singular collapse .    in this work",
    "we consider a possibility of collapse in systems , similar to the gravitational self - attracting hamiltonian particle systems , but with a general potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after this brief introduction we formally define the model and derive an integral equation to solve for a saddle - point density profile .",
    "then we describe the results obtained by a numerical iterative solution of this equation for various @xmath1 . after this",
    ", we look at the local stability of the solutions of the integral equation and link their stability to the stability ( metastability ) of the corresponding states of the self - attracting system . finally , we discuss the results and directions for further investigation .    while the collapse is shown to be a generic property of self - gravitating systems occurring in both the me and the ce , the me allows to obtain more information about the system than the ce .",
    "for example , negative heat - capacity states , that precede the collapse in the me , are not accessible in the ce , as it is in the much better studied case of normal first - order phase transitions @xcite . in the rest of our paper",
    "we consider systems only in the me . in our studies",
    "we strongly rely on the large body of existing results derived for @xmath15 , often rigorously @xcite .",
    "let us consider a 3-dimensional me of @xmath16 particles each having mass @xmath17 , interacting with an attractive pair potential @xmath18 .",
    "these particles are confined to a spherical container with radius @xmath19 ; the total energy of the particles is @xmath20 .",
    "the microcanonical entropy ( equal to the logarithm of the density of states ; here and in the following we put @xmath21 ) can be expressed as : @xmath22 \\right\\}\\ ] ]    after integrating over the momenta and introducing a dimensionless energy @xmath23 and radial coordinates @xmath24 , eq .",

    "( [ s2 ] ) that the entire thermodynamical behavior of our system depends on the single variable @xmath33 ; and for a system to remain in the same state when the number of particles is varied but the energy per particle is fixed , the system size @xmath19 should scale as @xmath34 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath35 is the largest value of @xmath13 for which no thermodymanic scaling is observed and hence some non - traditional phase transitions may exist .",
    "we assume that the number of particles @xmath16 is large and go to a continuum limit , replacing a @xmath36-dimensional configurational integral in ( [ s2 ] ) by a functional integral over possible density profiles @xmath37 ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath38)\\right\\},\\ ] ] where the `` effective action '' functional @xmath39 is defined : @xmath40= \\b\\left(\\e+{1\\over 2}\\int\\int{\\r(\\vec x_1)\\r(\\vec x_2)\\over    \\g \\left(\\int\\r(\\vec x)d\\vec x -1 \\right)-{3\\over 2}\\ln \\b-",

    "the above equations look similar to those for the gravitational ( @xmath15 ) case which are derived , for example , in @xcite , to where the reader is referred for a more detailed description of the derivation .",
    "however , we can not proceed further along the lines developed in the references mentioned above , which all deal with the gravitational case . for , unlike the gravitational case , when the @xmath58 property of a coulomb interaction @xmath3 allows one to reduce ( [ extr ] ) to a second - order differential equation , no such property exists for a general @xmath13 , and we have to deal with the integral equation for @xmath59 in ( [ extr ] ) directly .",

    "we then move to a lower energy point , use the previous energy point density profile as @xmath73 , and repeat the procedure again .",
    "caution in selecting the initial energy as well as the energy step has to be exercised to maintain the positiveness of the kinetic energy .",
    "in fact the initial energy has to be larger than @xmath78 , which is the potential energy for the flat density profile .",
    "as we progress towards lower energies , the density profiles get more and more peaked near the origin , and the absolute value of the potential energy increases . to allow for improper integrals in the numerical integration of ( [ main ] , [ main2 ] ) , we use a simple mid - point trapezoid rule .",
    "uniform meshes of 1000 - 2000 points were usually sufficient .",
    "however , in order to determine the position of a phase transition point with a sufficiently high precision in order to compare our results to the existing ones for @xmath15 , and to achieve also a discontinuous phase transition for smaller @xmath13 , we had to use finer meshes with up to 5000 points .",
    "the convergence parameter @xmath45 was usually set to be @xmath79 .",
    "the main conclusion that can be derived from the numerical results obtained is the following : for all @xmath1 , as for @xmath15 , there is a certain energy @xmath80 below which the system collapses and the entropy exhibits a discontinuous jump .",
    "the results for @xmath80 are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "plot of collapse energy @xmath80 vs. potential exponent @xmath13 .    to verify our calculations of @xmath80",
    ", we compare our result for @xmath81 with the existing data obtained by other methods .",
    "our number , @xmath82 , is consistent with @xmath83 , quoted in @xcite .",
    "since the behavior of self - attractive systems is quantitatively similar for all @xmath1 , let us consider in more detail , for example , a system with @xmath84 .",
    "plots of entropy @xmath85 and inverse temperature @xmath86 are presented in fig .",
    "3 .     plots of entropy @xmath85 and entropy derivative @xmath87 for @xmath84 . the radius of excluded central volume @xmath88 .",
    "the points @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are defined in the text .    as we go down along the energy axis @xmath33 , the entropy decreases as well , passing through an inflection point @xmath90 where @xmath91 reaches its maximum @xmath92 . for energies below this inflection point",
    ", the system has a negative specific heat ( @xmath93 ) and is therefore unstable in the ce .",
    "as we pass through the @xmath90 point and continue decreasing the energy , the convergence of ( [ it ] ) becomes slower and slower , and at the point @xmath94 the iterations start to diverge .",
    "it is straightforward to show for all @xmath1 ( see , e.g. @xcite for @xmath15 ) that the entropy is unbounded from above with respect to uniform squeezing of all the matter into a sphere with a radius going to zero .",
    "hence , if no short - range cutoff is present , it is reasonable to assume that the entropy discontinuity at @xmath80 is infinite .    if some form of a short - range cutoff is introduced , the entropy discontinuity may become finite . to investigate this we tried two approaches .",
    "one , suggested in @xcite , is to place a small spherical excluded volume with a radius @xmath95 in the center of the system , or , in other words , to replace a spherical container with a spherical shell container .",
    "the other approach is to replace the original `` bare '' potential @xmath96 with a `` soft '' potentials of the form @xmath97 .",
    "for a reasonably small short - range cutoff ( @xmath98 for small @xmath13 , @xmath99 for @xmath100 for both approaches ) the behavior of the pre - collapsed system is virtually unaffected .",
    "a finiteness of the integration mesh can also play the role of an effective central excluded volume ; for our method of integration the size of such an effective excluded volume is roughly of the order of the mesh step .",
    "introduction of a short - range cutoff makes the existence of a non - singular collapsed phase possible .",
    "however , being applied directly , the iterative method ( [ it ] ) still diverges when @xmath101 . to make it convergent",
    ", we introduced a map with a variable `` step '' , @xmath102+(1-\\s)\\r_i(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the step size parameter .",
    "choosing @xmath104 sufficiently small ( as small as @xmath105 ) , we were able to make the algorithm convergent for @xmath101 .",
    "the connection between the numerical stability of the iterative algorithm and the thermodynamic stability of the corresponding phase is analyzed in the next section .",
    "a typical density profile in the collapsed phase exhibits a much higher concentration around the origin than to the normal ( un - collapsed ) phase ; plots of density profiles for @xmath84 are presented in fig .",
    "density profiles @xmath106 for @xmath84 for normal ( dashed line ) and collapsed ( solid line ) phases for the energy @xmath107 , when entropies of both phases are the same .",
    "the radius of the excluded central volume is @xmath88 .",
    "a collapsed phase exists not only for @xmath101 , but for @xmath108 as well .",
    "in fact , this phase is globally stable in the range of energies where its entropy is higher than that of the normal phase , i.e. when @xmath109 . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the collapsed phase is metastable and above some energy @xmath111 becomes unstable even locally ( see fig .",
    "however , being cutoff - dependent , @xmath112 and @xmath111 are not directly related to the fundamental properties of the original self - attracting system .",
    "finally we return to the exact @xmath67 solution which exists for @xmath68 and @xmath15 .",
    "our attempts to approach this solution by the numerical iterative methods ( [ it],[it1 ] ) failed .",
    "in fact , even after substituting the @xmath113 into ( [ it1 ] ) as an initial approximation @xmath114 , the iterative solution of ( [ it1 ] ) evolved either to a normal or to a collapsed solution depending on the value of the step @xmath104 .",
    "we calculated the entropies for the three solutions , that exist at @xmath68 : a normal @xmath115 , a collapsed @xmath116 ( with a sufficiently small central core , so that it still exists at this energy ) , and a @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath119 , which , together with the evidence obtained from the iterative procedures mentioned above , strongly suggests that in the space of solutions ( or fixed points ) of ( [ it1 ] ) , both normal and collapsed @xmath106 are at least locally stable ( attractive ) , while @xmath120 is unstable ( repulsive ) .",
    "the iterative solutions of the integral equation ( [ main],[it ] ) for the saddle point density profile @xmath121 of the self - attracting system correspond to thermodynamically stable or unstable states . in this section",
    "we will give the necessary and the sufficient conditions for the thermodynamic stability of the @xmath121 in terms of the stability of the iterative solutions of the integral equation ( [ main ] ) . to that end",

    "( [ sfm ] ) are larger than 1 , which make the iterative maps ( [ it],[it1 ] ) unstable , so that such solutions can not be found iteratively .",
    "this completes the demonstration of the equivalence of the two stabilities .",
    "\\1 . in the previous sections we revealed the existence of collapse and associated with it a discontinuity in the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble of particles with @xmath96 attraction for @xmath1 .",
    "this discontinuity was an infinite jump if no short - range cutoff was present .",
    "a carefully introduced short - range cutoff leaves the properties of pre - collapsed system virtually unaffected , but makes the entropy jump finite and allows to observe the collapsed phase .",
    "we proved that the stability of a solution of the integral equation for a saddle - point density profile is a sufficient condition for the profile to make the entropy a maximum and therefore be either stable or metastable .",
    "we modified the integral equation to make the reverse also true .",
    "\\2 . in the range of @xmath13",
    "we have been working with , @xmath1 , the potential is often called `` non - integrable '' , since the integral @xmath141 diverges at its upper limit .",
    "as the potential becomes integrable ( @xmath142 ) , the continuum approach used here becomes inapplicable because the short - range density fluctuations , which the continuous approach can not account for , become dominant over the long - range effects .",
    "formally , the short - range nature of the behavior of the systems for @xmath142 manifests itself as the divergence of the integral @xmath141 at its lower limit .",
    "a very important question which remains is that of the order of the gravitation - like phase transition .",
    "here we have to distinguish between the collapse itself , which happens at @xmath94 , and the phase transition which happens at the energy @xmath112 where the entropies of non - collapsed and collapsed states are equal ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "since the entropy at the collapse point @xmath94 exhibits a discontinuous jump , the collapse is often called a zero - order phase transition @xcite . however",
    ", the collapse is not a phase transition in the formal sense since it converts a metastable state into a stable one , which can be singular or finite , depending on the presence of the short - range cutoff .    on the other hand , the `` true '' phase transition between stable phases , which happens at @xmath12 , is sometimes referred to as a `` gravitational first - order phase transition '' @xcite .",
    "its distinct features include an inability of the two phases ( non - collapsed and collapsed ) to coexist and a discontinuous @xmath143 i.e. temperature @xcite . yet in the `` normal '' me first - order phase transition in a long - range interacting system ( such as a mean - field potts model ) , @xmath144 remains continuous and smooth , but exhibits non - monotonous behavior : the interval of energies where phases coexist includes an interval where @xmath145 is positive and the specific heat is negative ( see fig .  5 ) @xcite .",
    "hence there is an intrinsic difference between the normal and the gravitational first - order phase transitions .",
    "even more , normal first - order phase transitions are found to replace gravitational first - order phase transitions which occur in the self - attracting systems that we consider here , if the short - range cutoff is sufficiently increased . as was noted in @xcite for @xmath15 ,",
    "there is a critical excluded volume radius @xmath146 above which there is no discontinuity in the entropy vs. energy plot .",
    "we observed that this trend is generic for all @xmath1 and holds for both excluded volume and soft potential cutoffs .",
    "now the critical cutoff radius @xmath147 increases with increasing @xmath13 , roughly varying in value from below @xmath148 for @xmath149 , to above @xmath150 for @xmath151 , respectively . for a system with a cutoff radius larger than @xmath147 ,",
    "the entropy vs. energy plot is continuous and exhibits all characteristics of a normal first order phase transition @xcite : the convex dip and associated with it an interval of energies , where @xmath152 is positive and the heat capacity is negative ( fig .  5 ) .",
