    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses between @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite are observed to reside at the centers of dark matter halos with masses @xmath3 .",
    "smaller dark matter halos , such as hosts of present day dwarf galaxies or galaxies at high redshifts , are expected to be populated with intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) with masses in the range @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the origin of smbhs and imbhs is still not well understood . in hierarchical structure formation these black holes",
    "are expected to grow from initial seeds as a result of galaxy mergers in which black holes coalesce ( see * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "gas - rich mergers fuel agn emitting energy in the optical , ultraviolet and x - ray bands .",
    "roughly 10% of low - redshift agn ( @xmath5 ) are radio - loud @xcite , producing a pair of collimated relativistic jets which could be observed to greater distances because of the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "the fraction of radio - loud quasars at higher redshifts ( @xmath6 ) was shown to be @xmath7% @xcite , suggesting no evolution of the radio - loud fraction with @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , if the merger is dry and the merging galaxies do not have enough gas to feed the black hole , a dormant massive black hole ( mbh ) results without observable electromagnetic signature .    even though the samples of both smbhs and imbhs build up ,",
    "the percentage of galaxies hosting central black holes ( the so - called occupation fraction ) is still unclear , especially in low mass galaxies @xcite , and until recently imbhs were considered hypothetical .",
    "however , recent observations have shown that some of dwarf galaxies in the local universe could indeed be populated by imbhs @xcite .",
    "the growing observational evidence includes 151 dwarf galaxies with candidate black holes in the mass range @xmath9 as identified from optical emission line ratios and/or broad h@xmath10 emission @xcite ; 28 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with black hole masses in @xmath11 range in nearby low - mass , low - luminosity dwarf galaxies found with the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that large fraction of hard x - ray sources in dwarf galaxies are ultra - luminous , suggesting that they actually are imbhs ; @xcite describe four dwarf seyferts with masses @xmath12 ; @xcite reported observations of a @xmath13 black hole in the dwarf galaxy rgg 118 ; while @xcite list eleven additional black holes with masses between @xmath14 . finally , it was shown that more than @xmath15% of early - type galaxies with a stellar mass less that @xmath16 are expected to have massive black holes in their cores @xcite .",
    "all this observational evidence suggests that imbhs in dwarf galaxies are not as exotic as previously thought .",
    "however , dynamical mass measurements suggest a decline in the occupation fraction of black holes in host galaxies with velocity dispersion below 40 km s@xmath17 @xcite .    one way to improve our constraints on the black hole occupation fraction is by probing the population of quiescent black holes when they are temporary illuminated by a tidal disruption event ( tde ) in which a star passing too close to the black hole is shredded by a gravitational tide which exceeds the self - gravity of the star",
    ". theoretical work on tdes spans several decades , including works by @xcite and others .",
    "when a tde occurs , part of the stellar mass is ejected away , forming an elongated stream and heating the ambient medium @xcite , while the bound debris are accreted by the black hole emitting bright observable flare at a wide range of wavelengths from radio to @xmath18-rays @xcite . however , for very massive black holes ( @xmath19 for a solar mass star * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the tidal disruption distance is smaller than the schwarzschild radius and stars are swallowed whole without exhibiting tde flares .",
    "the emission peaks in the uv or soft x - rays with typical peak luminosity in the soft x - rays band being @xmath20 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "the flare decays on the timescale of months or years as a power law with a typical index @xmath21 , which is often considered to be the telltale signature of a tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole .",
    "following the first detection by rosat @xcite , about 50 tdes have been observed @xcite in hard x - ray @xcite , soft x - ray @xcite , uv @xcite and optical @xcite wavelengths .",
    "some of the observed tdes exhibit unusual properties .",
    "in particular , one of the detected tdes shows an excess of variability in its light curve @xcite which can be explained if the black hole is actually a binary with a mass of @xmath22 , mass ratio of 0.1 and semimajor axis of 0.6 milliparsecs @xcite .",
    "this candidate appears to have one of the most compact orbits among the known smbh binaries and has overcome the `` final parsec problem '' @xcite . upon coalescence",
    ", it will be a strong source of gravitational wave emission in the sensitivity range of elisa .",
    "three other tdes appear to be very bright in x - rays with peak soft x - ray isotropic luminosity being highly super - eddington @xcite , while followup observations showed that these events were also associated with bright , compact , variable radio synchrotron emission @xcite . the observed",
    "high x - ray luminosity can be explained if the tidal disruption of stars in these cases powered a highly beamed relativistic jet pointed at the observer @xcite .",
    "based on these three observations , @xcite concluded that @xmath23 of all tde source relativistic jets , while @xcite and @xcite estimate that @xmath24 of tdes produce jetted emission at the observed level .",
    "formation of jets in tde is a topic of active research , e.g. , works by @xcite .",
    "based on the observations the tde rate was derived to be @xmath25 per year per galaxy @xcite and is consistent with order - of magnitude theoretical predictions when imbhs are ignored .",
    "the tde rates were shown to be sensitive to the density profile and relaxation processes taking place in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most commonly used estimate of the tde rates is based on the steady - state solution of the fokker - planck equation describing the diffusion of stars in angular momentum and energy space driven by two - body relaxation .",
    "this process re - populates stellar orbits along which stars are disrupted by mbh , the so - called `` loss cone '' . with the two - body relaxation being the main process to refill the loss cone , other processes that may contribute to the stellar budget",
    "were also discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear why imbhs do not contribute to the observed tdes , and most of the related theoretical studies show that black holes with masses smaller than @xmath22 can disrupt stars at rates higher than those of higher masses @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if small halos are occupied by imbhs , most disruptions are expected to occur in these systems making tdes particularly good probes of the poorly - understood , low - mass end of mbh mass function @xcite . moreover ,",
    "once detected in large quantities , tdes will offer insight into physics of quiescent black holes , probe extreme accretion physics near the last stable orbit , provide the means to measure the spin of black holes and probe general relativity in the strong - field limit @xcite .",
    "in addition , jetted tdes will allow us to explore processes through which relativistic jets are born .    in this paper",
    "we extrapolate the population of tdes to high redshifts ( out to @xmath26 ) , and predict their detectability with the next - generation x - ray telescopes .",
    "we propose a new way to test the occupation fraction of imbhs through their unique contribution to the x - ray luminosity function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we summarize our approach in section [ sec : methods ] , deriving tde rates as a function and outlining the tde luminosity prescriptons .",
    "we showing the intrinsic x - ray luminosity function in section [ sec : lf ] .",
    "next , we make predictions for realistic next generation x - ray surveys in section [ sec : obs ] focusing on upgrades of _ swift _ and _ chandra_. we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "even though tdes have been extensively studied , the predicted rates are not in good agreement with observations .",
    "therefore , we adopt simple assumptions for the event rates from literature with the aim to establish general trends in the redshift evolution of the tde number counts and their observable signals . after defining the population of galaxies and black holes in section [ sec : bh ] ,",
    "we start by considering rates in a given galaxy of halo mass @xmath27 ( section [ sec : tde ] ) and generalize for a cosmological population of galaxies in section [ sec : cosm ] .",
    "we discuss the luminosity of tde flares in section [ sec : lum ] .",
    "one of the key model ingredients that determines the tde rates is the distribution of stars in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "depending on the merger history of the galaxy and the efficiency of feedback on star formation , the stellar density profile can develop either a core or a cusp . for simplicity",
    "we adopt a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) density profile @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the constant velocity dispersion and @xmath30 the halo virial radius . for a galaxy of halo mass @xmath27 ,",
    "the relation between the halo mass and the velocity dispersion is simply @xmath31 ; while the velocity dispersion can be directly related to the black hole mass using the @xmath32 relation @xcite @xmath33 which holds for a wide range of black hole masses from @xmath34 m@xmath35 @xcite to @xmath36 m@xmath35 @xcite in galaxies with a bulge @xcite . assuming the isothermal stellar distribution",
    ", @xcite derived tde rates for galaxies with a single central black hole , while @xcite report the rates in a case of a black hole binary . as we discuss in section [ sec : tde ] , for mbh with masses in the range @xmath37 the tde rates per halo computed using the isothermal stellar distribution are similar ( within tens of percent ) to more realistic estimates based on a large galaxy sample @xcite , which justifies our assumption .",
    "the error in the rate estimation due to the idealized stellar density profile is small compared to other uncertainties , e.g. , introduced by the poorly constrained occupation fraction of imbhs in low mass galaxies , which amounts to one - two orders of magnitude uncertainty in the derived volumetric tde rates .    in order to address the uncertainty in the occupation fraction , @xmath38 , of mbh we consider two extreme cases : ( i )",
    "complete black hole occupation of all halos that form stars , and ( ii ) assume that there are no black holes with masses below @xmath39 , which is equivalent to the vanishing occupation fraction in halos below @xmath40 ( depending on redshift ) .",
    "we refer to the former case as mbhs ( or @xmath41 ) and latter case as smbhs ( or @xmath42 ) .",
    "the two cases can be considered as an upper ( former case ) and lower ( latter case ) limits for the occupation fraction yielding , respectively , upper and lower limits for the expected tde rates .",
    "even though black hole seeds could exist in ever smaller halos in the hierarchical picture of structure formation , one also needs stars to fuel a tde flare .",
    "the lowest mass of a halo in which stars can form at high redshifts before the end of hydrogen reionization at @xmath43 is determined by the cooling condition , which involves either molecular or atomic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the lowest temperature coolant , molecular hydrogen , forms stars in dark matter halos as tiny as @xmath44 . however , hydrogen molecules are easily destroyed by radiative feedback @xcite in which case star formation proceeds via atomic cooling in halos of @xmath45 . here",
    "we neglect the molecular cooling channel and assume that before reionization galaxies can form in halos down to a velocity dispersion of @xmath46 km s@xmath17 , which host black holes of mass @xmath47 .",
    "after reionization is complete , the smallest star forming halos are sterilized by photoheating feedback which evaporates gas out of all halos with velocity dispersion less than @xmath48 km s@xmath17 . as a result , small galaxies stop producing many stars and the loss cone of stars around the central black hole is most likely not refilled efficiently enough to support the equilibrium tde rates .",
    "therefore , we assume in the post - reionization era that all black holes below @xmath49 remain without fuel and do not source tdes . in a realistic reionization scenario ,",
    "the minimal halo mass which efficiently forms stars would gradually rise with redshift @xcite .",
    "however , because the reionization history is poorly constrained at present , we adopt the simplest scenario of instantaneous reionization at @xmath50 , consistent with latest constraints by the _ planck _ satellite @xcite .",
    "the minimal black hole mass in our mbhs scenario is thus @xmath51    in our second , conservative , scenario we assume that @xmath52 .",
    "several effects can contribute to low tde rates from imbhs , justifying our smbhs scenario : black holes could be kicked out of halos as a result of merger ; radiation from agn could have negative feedback on star formation ( agn feedback ) , in this case the loss cone would not be replenished .",
    "another possible feedback mechanism is the stellar feedback from supernova explosions which can expel gas from the halo making star formation less efficient @xcite .",
    "an additional model ingredient that determines the tde rate is the merger history of a halo which we incorporate in section [ sec : cosm ] .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : tde ] , the tde rate in a recently merged galaxy is boosted by several orders of magnitude for @xmath53 years compared to a galaxy with a quiet merger history , e.g. , works by @xcite .",
    "the enhanced tde rates are explained by the fact that the dynamics of the system are changed by the presence of a black hole binary produced as a result of a merger .      in the case of a single black hole ,",
    "the most secure way to feed stars into the loss cone around the black hole is via the standard two - body relaxation , which sets a lower limit on the tde rates between @xmath54 and @xmath55 yr@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "other processes that may contribute to the stellar budget include resonant relaxation @xcite , presence of massive perturbers such as stellar clusters or gas clouds @xcite , nonspherical geometry @xcite , black hole binaries @xcite , and anisotropy in the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "assuming that the loss cone is refilled via two - body relaxation , the rate of tidal disruptions per halo per year for an isothermal stellar distribution @xcite reads @xmath56 where we only considered the disruption of solar mass stars ) on stellar mass can be re - introduced by adding a factor @xmath57 with @xmath58 for stars along the lower main sequence . ] .",
    "despite the fact that the stellar density used to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : tde1 ] ) is idealized , the rates are similar to those derived by @xcite for stellar profiles from a real galaxy sample . @xcite",
    "estimated tde rates due to two - body relaxation from @xmath59 galaxies with @xmath60 at @xmath61 and got @xmath62 for galaxies with a core and @xmath63 for galaxies with a cusp .",
    "we checked that for our choice of @xmath32 relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : tde1 ] ) gives similar rates in normalization ( up to several tens of percents ) and comparable slope of @xmath64 when compared to the cusp fit of @xcite .",
    "modeling tde rates in merging system is more challenging , and rates are less understood than disruptions by a single mbh .",
    "even though all theoretical studies point in the direction of tde rates boosted for @xmath53 years by @xmath65 orders of magnitude compared to the disruption by single mbh , there is no consensus on details and it is unclear at present what is the leading process that replenishes the loss cone .",
    "when two galaxies merge , the black holes in the galactic cores first inspiral toward each other due to the dynamical friction .",
    "next , when the mass in gas and stars enclosed within the black hole orbit is smaller than the total mass of the two black holes , the black holes become gravitationally bound and evolve as a binary . for black hole masses of @xmath66",
    "this occurs when the typical separation between the two black holes is @xmath67parsec .",
    "gradually , the binary hardens .",
    "if the binary reaches separations @xmath68 pc , gravitational waves are emitted as the two mbhs coalesce .",
    "each one of the stages in the evolution of the binary has its own rate of tdes . using n - body simulations to model dry major mergers , @xcite",
    "conclude that in the first stage , the tidal disruption rate for two well separated mbhs in merging system has similar levels to the sum of the rates of two individual mbhs in two isolated galaxy . in their fiducial model @xcite",
    "find that after two mbhs get close enough to form a bound binary , the disruption rate is enhanced by a factor of 80 within a short time lasting for 13 myr .",
    "this boosted disruption stage finishes after the smbh binary evolves to a compact binary system , corresponding to a drop back of the disruption rate to a level few times higher than for an individual mbh",
    ". other studies also point in the direction of enhanced rates from binaries .",
    "in particular , @xcite considered secular evolution of stellar orbits in the gravitational potential of an unequal mass binary and derived rates of @xmath69 tdes per year per galaxy for a @xmath70 m@xmath35 primary black hole and a binary mass ratio @xmath71 .",
    "the duration of this boosted disruption stage was determined by the dynamical friction time scale @xmath72 @xcite used scattering experiments to show that gravitational slingshot interactions between hardened binaries and a bound spherical isothermal stellar cusp will be accompanied by a burst of tdes .",
    "it appears that a significant fraction of stars initially bound to the primary black hole will be scattered into the loss cone by resonant interaction with the secondary black hole .",
    "@xcite provide a fitting formula for the maximal tde rates per halo with a binary mbh system @xmath73 and show that the enhancement lasts for @xmath74 years .",
    "@xcite included the kozai - lidov effect , chaotic three - body orbits , the evolution of the binary and the non - keplerian stellar potentials and found that for masses of @xmath75 m@xmath35 and @xmath76 m@xmath35 , tde rates 0.2 events per year last for @xmath77 years which is three orders of magnitude larger than for a single black hole and broadly agrees with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "@xcite included the same processes as @xcite and arrived at similar rates .",
    "they found that the majority of tdes are due to chaotic orbits in agreement with @xcite , showing that the kozai - lidov effect plays a secondary role .",
    "their rates are somewhat smaller than in @xcite largely because the authors consider less cuspy stellar profiles . @xcite",
    "considered the evolution of stellar disruption around a binary with mbhs masses of 10@xmath78 m@xmath35 and 10@xmath79 m@xmath35 due to the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism yielding rate of 10@xmath80 tde per year for @xmath81 years .",
    "finally , @xcite concluded that the tde rates of stars by smbhs in the early phase of galaxy merger when galactic dynamical friction dominates could also be enhanced by several orders of magnitude ( up to @xmath82 events per year per galaxy ) as a result of the perturbation by companion galactic core and the triaxial gravitational potential of the galactic nucleus .    to accommodate tidal disruptions induced by binary mbhs",
    "we adopt the fitting function given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tde2 ] ) assuming that this enhanced rate last for a dynamical time @xmath83 , while for the rest of the time the tde rate is simply @xmath84 . as we can derive from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : tde1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tde2 ] ) we find that the tde rate scales as @xmath86 for binaries and @xmath87 for single black holes .",
    "this property has immediate implications to the total observable tde rates that will be discussed in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the observed tde number counts per unit time that originate from redshift @xmath8 depends on several factors with the dominant factor being the amount of halos of each mass and their merger history . to determine the halo abundance we make use of the sheth - tormen mass function @xcite in calculating the comoving number density of halos in each mass bin @xmath88 in units of @xmath89 mpc@xmath90 .",
    "next , adopting the merger rates of @xcite we calculate the dimensionless average merger rate @xmath91 ( in units of mergers per halo per unit redshift per unit halo mass ratio , @xmath92 ) , given by a fitting formula @xmath93(1+z)^{\\eta},\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    for each halo",

    "the probability , @xmath99 , is determined using the following criterion : if the time between mergers is larger than the dynamical time , the tde rates are those of single mbh , while if the time between mergers is smaller than @xmath83 , there is an enhancement due to binaries . given the merger rates , we estimate the probability of a halo of mass @xmath27 at redshift @xmath8 to be a result of a recent merger as follows @xmath100,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 for very light halos , mergers are frequent and halos typically undergo several mergers within @xmath83 , in which case the probability for a merger is near unity .",

    "independent of the accretion rate in simulations , super - eddington disks around black holes exhibit a surprisingly large efficiency of @xmath143 for non - rotating black holes ; while spinning black holes yield the maximal efficiency of jets of 130% @xcite .",

    "* ) , we use two simple approaches to derive first the bolometric , and then the x - ray , luminosity for each event .",
    "our first approach ( model a ) is to simply assign the eddington luminosity to each event according to the black hole mass , @xmath151 . the second approach ( model b )",
    "assumes that the tde bolometric luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate .",
    "however , for imbhs the peak accretion rate exceeds both the observed rates and the simulated ones by few orders of magnitude . as studies have shown , tde luminosity is not likely to exceed few hundreds @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopt an upper limit of @xmath153 and the luminosity of each event reads @xmath154 .",

    "observations show that the x - ray luminosity of the three jetted tdes has a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) well fitted by a power law @xmath156 with a spectral index @xmath10 in the range of @xmath157 with @xmath158 for sw1112 - 82 , @xmath159 for sw1644 + 57 and @xmath160 for swj2058 + 05 .",

    "simulations show that tdes occurring around mbh binaries have similar peak luminosity in x - rays as tdes sourced by single black holes ; however , the light curve has stronger variability in time due to the perturbations introduced by the secondary black hole @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopt similar prescription as described above to asigned x - ray luminosity to tdes sourced by binaries .",
    "we can now make predictions for the intrinsic x - ray luminosity function of tdes in the two cases of smbhs and mbhs .",
    "it appears that , because tde rates from single and binary black holes scale differently with @xmath85 , binaries dominate tde production in the most massive halos and , as a result , contribute the brightest tde flares in model a. however , this contribution is significant only when small dark matter halos are occupied by imbhs providing enough progenitors to form smbh binaries . in the case of model",
    "b , the most luminous events happen in systems with @xmath177 which are dominated by single black holes . in case only smbhs populate halos , tdes from binaries occur only in systems with both black holes of @xmath178 which are extremely rare and contribute at most few percent of the brightest tde flares .",

    "in addition , we considered two different prescriptions for the tde luminosity : ( i ) eddington luminosity , and ( ii ) luminosity proportional to the accretion rate . even though current tde observations suggest that the occupation fraction of imbhs is very low with the majority of tdes being produced by black holes of masses @xmath193 , the results are far from being conclusive .",
    "our study offers new ways to constrain the occupation fraction of imbhs at different cosmological redshifts , and our main conclusions are as follows    1 .",
    "we show that jetted tdes can be observed out to high redshifts and offer a unique probe of the occupancy of imbhs .",
    "earlier works have demonstrated that tde rates in merging systems are enhanced due to gravitational interactions of stars with binary black holes . using this result",
    "we find that the higher is the occupation fraction of imbhs the stronger is the impact of binaries on the total observed tde rates .",
    "this is because with high imbhs occupation there are enough progenitors to form binary systems .",
    "we show that tdes sourced by binary black holes dominate the bright end of the x - ray luminosity function if the occupation fraction of imbhs is high and if the tde luminosity scales as eddington .",
    "the shape of the tde x - ray luminosity function is expected to show a unique signature of imbhs in the form of two additional `` knees '' , compared to the case with low imbhs occupation .",
    "these features arise from the jetted and non - jetted contribution of black hole binaries and are independent of our luminosity prescription ( although the features are more evident when the tde luminosity scales as the eddington luminosity ) . therefore , for a complete tde sample , the shape of the luminosity function could be used to set an upper limit on the occupation fraction of imbhs .",
    "our results imply that , if @xmath194 and the tde luminosity scales as eddington , the brightest events detected by bat could be associated with massive binary black holes . in this case",
    "the x - ray luminosity of tde flares is expected to have excess of variability due to the binary interaction in addition to the typical power - law decay .",
    "3 .   the fraction of observable tde that are generated by binaries depends on the luminosity prescription as well as on the sensitivity of the telescope . with current x - ray telescopes ,",
    "we expect to see @xmath195 and up to 64% of tdes produced by binary black holes if the occupation fraction of imbhs is high ; while the fraction is at most 1.3% if the occupation fraction of imbhs is low .",
    "since dimmer events are mainly contributed by single black holes , the binary fraction drops with the telescope sensitivity .",
    "4 .   detection of tdes in deep field observations by _ chandra _ and future missions would provide a smoking gun signature of imbhs .",
    "we find that in the case when only smbhs contribute , tdes are not expected in _",
    "deep fields ; while if the imbhs occupation fraction is high , some point sources in the archival data of x - ray deep field surveys may be tdes . to identify such events one should compare two images of the same deep field separated by an interval of at least a year .",
    "non - detection of tdes from high redshifts can set upper limits on the occupation fraction of imbhs and constrain direct collapse scenarios of smbh formation , e.g. , works by @xcite .",
    "increasing sensitivity of x - ray telescopes by a factor of 50 comparing to current instruments will increase the expected number counts by a factor of @xmath196 for a bat - like mission and a factor of @xmath197 for an xrt - like mission with 1ks itegration time . for a deep field survey the improvement strongly depends on the occupation fraction of imbhs .",
    "current sensitivity is enough to resolve most tdes if @xmath42 , and , therefore , improvement in sensitivity would not yield new events in this case .",
    "however , if @xmath41 , improving the sensitivity by a factor of 50 would increase the number of tdes per snapshot by a factor of 5 - 10 .    comparing our model to existing observations ,",
    "a low occupation fraction is suggested ( see also stone & metzger 2016 ) .",
    "however , observations are far from being conclusive and it is still unclear why tdes sourced by imbhs with masses below @xmath22 are not observed .",
    "several possible explanations can follow : imbhs are kicked out of their dark matter halos as a result of mergers @xcite , smbhs are formed from massive seeds in massive halos , observational selection effects exclude tdes around imbhs , the assumption of an isothermal density distribution is less suitable for smaller galaxies , or low mass systems are more sensitive to agn feedback which expels gas from halo and limits star formation leading to inefficient replenishing of the loss cone .",
    "if @xmath38 is high at low black hole masses and imbh binaries indeed play a role in sourcing tdes , these binaries would also produce gravitational waves on their approach to coalescence .",
    "elisa should be sensitive to mbh binaries over a wide range of total masses and mass ratios , e.g. , systems with total mass @xmath198 m@xmath35 and mass ratios of @xmath199 will yield signal to noise ratio of @xmath200 out to @xmath201 @xcite . therefore , in the future one could use a cross - correlation between the stochastic gravitational wave background and the spatial distribution of brightest tdes to constrain the role of imbhs in tde production .",
    "if the two quantities correlate , imbhs must make a significant contribution to tdes .",
    "in addition to the x - ray observations discussed here , jetted tdes may also be bright in the radio band @xcite .",
    "snapshot rates of jetted tdes in radio band have been computed by @xcite , and prospects for the detection of jetted tdes by the square killometer array out to @xmath202 as well as the synergy between radio and x - ray observations was discussed @xcite . at present",
    "there is no consensus as to whether x - ray emission by jetted agn should correlate with their radio emission .",
    "in particular , the peak emissivity of sw1644 + 57 appeared 100 days after the bat trigger and the lorentz factor of radio jet was found to be @xmath203 , much lower than what was observed in x - rays right after detection ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "the radio data require a different energy injection mechanism such as an outflow with a distribution of lorentz factors @xcite . therefore",
    ", we did not use our simplex model to predict radio emission from tdes .",
    "tidal disruptions occurring at high redshifts can reveal the seeds of quasars . in this paper",
    "we have assumed that the high - redshift population resembles that of today ; however , its properties might evolve with redshift .",
    "in particular , simulations show that first stars were much more massive ( up to @xmath205 ) than present - day stars and could serve as an additional population of seeds .",
    "star formation in high - redshift , low - mass halos strongly depends on feedback processes such as photoheating feedback , as well as agn and supernovae feedback .",
