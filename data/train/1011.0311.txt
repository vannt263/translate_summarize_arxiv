    "consider a classical point particle of mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 moving on the punctured plane @xmath5 in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field of magnitude @xmath6 .",
    "suppose further that a singular magnetic flux line whose strength @xmath7 is oscillating with frequency @xmath8 intersects the plane at the origin .",
    "the equations of motion in phase space @xmath9 are generated by the time  dependent hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "here and throughout we denote @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "our aim is to understand the dynamics of this system for large times .",
    "of particular interest is the growth of energy as well as the drift of the guiding center .",
    "our main result in the present paper is to exhibit and to prove a resonance effect whose origin can qualitatively be understood as follows .",
    "the lorentz force equals @xmath15 in the induction free case when @xmath16 , the particle moves along a circle of fixed center ( cyclotron orbit ) with the cyclotron frequency @xmath17 and the cyclotron radius depending bijectively on the energy .",
    "if @xmath18 is nonzero but small then the energy , the frequency and the guiding center of the orbit become time dependent . for the time derivative of the energy computed in polar coordinates @xmath19 one finds that @xmath20 and so the acceleration rate is given by @xmath21 one may expect that @xmath22 is close to a periodic function of frequency @xmath23 ( which is the case when @xmath16 ) .",
    "if the frequencies @xmath23 and @xmath8 are resonant , i.e. if there exist indices @xmath24 and @xmath3 in the support of the fourier transforms of @xmath22 and @xmath18 , respectively , such that @xmath25 then one may speculate that @xmath26 is positive .    our original motivation to study this problem was to understand the dynamics of so called quantum charge pumps @xcite already on a classical level and to gain a detailed intuition on the dynamical mechanisms in the simplest case",
    "we suggest , however , that particle acceleration mechanisms might be of actual interest in various other models , for example in interstellar physics @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the equations of motion in this domain might exhibit similar ingredients as the ones studied here .",
    "we remark , too , that our results could be of interest in accelerator physics . while the betatron principle uses a linearly time dependent flux tube to accelerate particles on cyclotron orbits around the flux @xcite , the resonance effect we observe in the present paper has the feature that acceleration can be achieved with arbitrarily small field strength .",
    "a second aspect is that , in contrast to the case of a linearly increasing flux , cyclotron orbits which do not encircle the flux tube are accelerated as well .",
    "in fact , for the linear case it was shown in @xcite that outside the flux tube one has the usual drift of the guiding center , without acceleration , along the field lines of the averaged potential .",
    "in the case of resonant frequencies one readily observes an accelerated motion numerically , see figure  [ spiral ] for an illustration .",
    "a typical resonant trajectory is a helix - like curve whose center goes out at the same rate as the radius grows . at the moment ,",
    "a complete treatment of the equations of motion is out of reach .",
    "therefore we first apply a resonant averaging method to derive a hamiltonian which is formally a first order approximation in a small coupling constant of the flux tube .",
    "we then analyze its flow and show a certain type of asymptotic behavior at large times with the aid of differential topological methods . though this approach gives only an existence result we use the analysis to derive the leading asymptotic terms .",
    "then , in the second stage of our analysis , these asymptotic terms are used to formulate a simplified version of the evolution equations .",
    "we decouple the equations by substituting the anticipated leading asymptotic terms into the right - hand sides .",
    "the decoupled system admits a rigorous asymptotic analysis whose conclusions turn out to be fully consistent with the formulas derived by the averaging methods .",
    "this holds under the assumption that the singular flux tube has a correct sign of the time derivative when the particle passes next to the origin .",
    "it should be emphasized that the singular magnetic flux is not assumed to be very small in the analysis of the decoupled system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : results ] we summarize our main results .",
    "namely , in subsection  [ results_hamiltonian ] we introduce the hamiltonian equations of motion in action - angle coordinates , in subsection  [ sec : results_averaged ] we study the averaged dynamics resulting from the poincar - von  zeipel elimination method and in subsection  [ sec : results_asymptotic ] we rederive the leading asymptotic terms by introducing a decoupled system .",
    "finally , in subsection  [ sec : results_guiding ] we interpret the formulas derived so far in guiding center coordinates .",
    "proofs , derivations and additional details are postponed to sections  [ sec : themodel ] , [ sec : vonzeipelmethod ] , [ sec : simplifiedequation ] and [ sec : conclusion ] , respectively .     of the equations of motion in the plane for",

    "in view of the rotational symmetry of the problem we prefer to work with polar coordinates , @xmath35 . denoting by @xmath36 and @xmath37 the momenta conjugate to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively",
    ", one has @xmath40 using that the vector potential @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 one finds for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_cartesian_def ] ) in polar coordinates @xmath43 the angular momentum @xmath44 is an integral of motion and thus the analysis of the system effectively reduces to a one - dimensional radial motion with time - dependent coefficients . from now on we set @xmath45 , and so the cyclotron frequency equals @xmath6 . put @xmath46 in the radial hamiltonian one may omit the term @xmath47 not contributing to the equations of motion and thus one arrives at the expression @xmath48 for definiteness we assume that @xmath49 .",
    "the time - independent hamiltonian system , with @xmath50 , is explicitly solvable .",
    "in particular , one finds the corresponding action - angle coordinates @xmath51 depending on @xmath52 as a parameter . substituting the given function @xmath53 for @xmath52 one gets a time - dependent transformation of coordinates .",
    "this is an essential step in the analysis of the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ eq : defhradial ] ) since action - angle coordinates are appropriate for employing averaging methods . postponing the derivation to section  [ sec : themodel ] , here",
    "we give the transformation equations : @xmath54 and conversely , @xmath55 furthermore , expressing the hamiltonian in action - angle coordinates one obtains @xmath56 and the corresponding hamiltonian equations of motion take the form @xmath57    using action - angle coordinates one can give a rough qualitative description of trajectories in the resonant case . from ( [ eq : canonic_r ] ) we see that @xmath58 where @xmath59 are extremal points of the trajectory ( see section  [ sec : themodel ] ) .",
    "as formulated more precisely in the sequel , resonant trajectories are characterized by a linear increase of @xmath60 for large times while @xmath61 .",
    "thus , as the angle @xmath62 increases the radius @xmath38 oscillates between @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( though @xmath63 , @xmath64 themselves are also time - dependent ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath53 is bounded , @xmath65 implies @xmath66 and @xmath67 as @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the trajectory in the @xmath69-plane periodically returns to the origin and then again escapes far away from it while its extremal distances to the origin converge respectively to zero and infinity .",
    "we refer again to figure  [ spiral ] for a typical trajectory in the @xmath69-plane in the case of resonant frequencies . concluding this subsection let us make more precise some assumptions . for the sake of definiteness we shall focus on the case when @xmath44 is positive and greater than the amplitude of @xmath70 and",
    "so @xmath53 is an everywhere strictly positive function .",
    "let us stress , however , that this restriction is not essential for the resonance effect as the radial hamiltonian ( [ eq : defhradial ] ) depends only on @xmath71 and thus the sign of @xmath53 is irrelevant for the motion in the radial direction . on the other hand , as discussed in subsection  [ sec : results_guiding ] , the sign of @xmath53 determines whether the orbit encircles the singular magnetic flux or not .",
    "furthermore , the frequency @xmath72 of the singular flux tube is treated as a parameter of the model and so we write @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a @xmath75-periodic real function possibly obeying additional assumptions .",
    "hence @xmath76 where the coupling constant @xmath77 is supposed to be positive and , if desired , playing the role of a small parameter .",

    "\\label{eq : resonantcase}\\ ] ] note that ( [ eq : resonantcase ] ) happens if and only if @xmath115 is not a constant function .",
    "discussion of the nonresonant case is , at least on the level of the averaged dynamics , simple and we avoid it .",
    "let us just remark that , in that case , it is not difficult to see that trajectories as well as the energy for the averaged hamiltonian are bounded .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : k_extended ] ) is appropriate for application of the poincar - von  zeipel elimination method whose basic scheme is briefly recalled in subsection  [ sec : vonzeipel_notation ] .",
    "the idea is to eliminate from @xmath116 , with the aid of a canonical transformation , a subgroup of angle variables which are classified as nonresonant , and thus to arrive at a new reduced hamiltonian @xmath117 depending only on the so called resonant angle variables and the corresponding actions .",
    "note , however , that a good deal of information about the system is contained in the canonical transformation itself .    to achieve this goal one works with formal power series in the parameter @xmath77 , and the construction",
    "is in fact an infinite recurrence . in particular , @xmath118 , where the leading term remains untouched , @xmath119 in practice one has to interrupt the recurrence at some order which means replacing the true hamiltonian system by an approximate averaged system . in our case",
    "we shall be content with a truncation at the first order .    in our model",
    ", one can apply the substitution @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 are such that @xmath123 ( @xmath124 exist since @xmath125 , @xmath96 are coprime ) .",
    "the phase @xmath126 is classified as nonresonant and can be eliminated while the phase @xmath127 is resonant and survives the canonical transformation .",
    "the procedure is explained in more detail in subsections  [ ses : von_zeipel_dynamics_1storder ] and [ sec:1st_order_dynamics ] . recalling ( [ eq : calk_0 ] ) combined with ( [ eq : w2_to_w1_rational ] ) , here we just give the resulting formula for the averaged hamiltonian truncated at the first order , @xmath128 where @xmath129_{-n\\nu}\\ , i^{n\\mu}\\beta(j_{1})^{|n|\\mu}\\ ,    e^{in(\\mu\\psi_{1}-\\nu\\psi_{2 } ) }    \\label{eq : k1cal_psi_j}\\ ] ] and @xmath130    one observes that the averaged four - dimensional hamiltonian system admits a reduction to a two - dimensional subsystem .",

    "it follows that the action @xmath133 is an integral of motion for the hamiltonian @xmath134 .",
    "the reduced system then depends on the coordinates @xmath127 , @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , by inspection of the series ( [ eq : k1cal_psi_j ] ) one finds that the hamiltonian for the reduced subsystem can be expressed in terms of a single complex variable @xmath136 and takes the form @xmath137 $ ] , with @xmath138 being a holomorphic function .",

    "this means to invert the canonical transformation @xmath154 which resulted from the poincar - von  zeipel elimination method .",
    "let us remark that the generating function of this canonical transformation is truncated at the first order as well .",
    "doing so one derives the following result whose proof can again be found in subsection  [ sec:1st_order_dynamics ] .",

    "it turned out that a typical trajectory reaches for large times an asymptotic domain characterized by formulas ( [ eq : vonzeipel_asympt_domain ] ) .",
    "being guided by this experience as well as by numerical experiments that we have carried out we suggest that formulas ( [ eq : vonzeipel_asympt_domain ] ) in fact give the correct leading asymptotic terms for the complete system .    to support this suggestion we now derive the leading asymptotic terms and a bound on the order of error terms for the original hamiltonian equations ( [ eqmotion1 ] ) , ( [ eqmotion2 ] ) while assuming that the system already follows the anticipated asymptotic regime . at the same time , we relax the assumption on smallness of the parameter @xmath77 .    applying the substitution @xmath159 to equations ( [ eqmotion1 ] ) , ( [ eqmotion2 ] )",
    "we obtain the system of differential equations @xmath160 where @xmath161 ( see ( [ eq : defat ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_rel_f ] ) ) .",
    "the real function @xmath162 is supposed to be continuously differentiable and @xmath75-periodic .",
    "the only assumptions imposed on @xmath97 in this subsection are that @xmath77 is not too big so that the function @xmath53 has no zeroes and is everywhere of the same sign as @xmath44 .",
    "recall that for definiteness @xmath44 is supposed to be positive . clearly , the functions @xmath53 and @xmath163 are bounded on @xmath164 .    equations ( [ eq : odefdevelopeps ] ) and ( [ eq : odephidevelopeps ] ) are nonlinear and coupled together . to decouple them we replace @xmath165 on the rhs of ( [ eq : odefdevelopeps ] ) and @xmath166 on the rhs of ( [ eq : odephidevelopeps ] ) by the respective leading asymptotic terms ( [ eq : vonzeipel_asympt_domain ] ) , as learned from the averaging method .",
    "this is done under the assumption that the solution has already reached the domain @xmath167 where @xmath166 is sufficiently large and starts to grow .",

    "the point is that if the denominator in ( [ eq : aux1 ] ) becomes very small for those @xmath190 for which @xmath191 then one gets a compensation by the vanishing numerator .",

    "one has to admit , however , that this argument still does not represent a complete mathematical proof of the asymptotic behavior of the action - angle variables @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "so far we have analyzed either the dynamics generated by an approximate averaged hamiltonian in subsection  [ sec : results_averaged ] or a simplified decoupled system in the current subsection .",
    "moreover , in the latter case it should be emphasized that the simplified equations were derived under the essential assumption that the dynamical system had already reached the regime characterized by an acceleration with an unlimited energy growth ( this is reflected by the assumption that @xmath173 is sufficiently large ) .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis of this analysis as well as on the basis of numerical experiments we formulate the following conjecture .",
