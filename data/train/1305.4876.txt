    "the possibility of finding ultraviolet finite supergravity theories  @xcite has been reopened in recent years due to the discovery of new unexpected ultraviolet cancellations .",
    "such theories were intensely studied in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s as possible fundamental theories of gravity , but fell out of favor when the way forward seemed blocked by the likely appearance of nonrenormalizable ultraviolet divergences .",

    "@xcite . ) at the time it was not possible to definitively determine the divergence structure of supergravity theories because there were no means available for carrying out the required computations . today",
    "thanks to the unitarity method  @xcite and the recently uncovered duality between color and kinematics  @xcite , we have the ability to address this .",
    "explicit calculations  @xcite show that @xmath3 supergravity  @xcite is finite for dimensions @xmath4 , at least through @xmath5 loops .",
    "if one were to extrapolate the observed cancellations , assuming no new ones occur , simple power counting suggests that no divergence can occur in the theory prior to seven loops .",
    "indeed , new detailed studies of the known standard symmetries of @xmath3 supergravity demonstrate that no valid counterterms can be found prior to the seventh loop order , but at seven loops a @xmath6 counterterm can be constructed that appears to obey all known symmetries  @xcite .",
    "an explicit expression for the potential counterterm was written down in ref .",
    "these facts suggest that @xmath3 supergravity diverges at seven loops ; of course , this assumes that all symmetries and structures have been properly taken into account .",
    "when similar arguments are applied to pure half - maximal supergravity  @xcite at three loops in @xmath0 and two loops in @xmath1 , counterterms valid under all known symmetries have been found  @xcite .",
    "however , we now know from explicit computations that there are no divergences corresponding to these counterterms  @xcite .",
    "in addition , arguments for finiteness in these cases based on string theory have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . at three loops in @xmath0 , there is only one available counterterm in pure @xmath7 supergravity  @xcite , so the fact that its coefficient vanishes implies that the full theory is three - loop finite .",
    "the surprisingly good ultraviolet behavior of pure half - maximal supergravity has led to conjectures to explain its origin .",
    "one conjecture is that it is due to a hidden superconformal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a more controversial conjecture is that the potential counterterms break relevant duality symmetries modified by quantum corrections  @xcite .",
    "a third conjecture is that the duality between color and kinematics leads to cancellation of the ultraviolet infinities in @xmath8 four - dimensional supergravity by the same mechanism that prevents forbidden loop - level color tensors from appearing in pure nonsupersymmetric yang - mills divergences  @xcite .    on the other hand , bossard , howe and stelle",
    "have given a potential symmetry explanation that would not require any new `` miracles '' beyond those of supersymmetry and ordinary duality symmetries . by conjecturing the existence of appropriate harmonic superspaces in @xmath0 and @xmath1 manifesting all 16 supercharges off shell  @xcite ,",
    "they have explained the observed ultraviolet cancellations .",
    "if true , it would predict that ultraviolet divergences start at four loops in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 in pure half - maximal supergravity .",
    "( an artifact of dimensional regularization is that there are no three - loop divergences in @xmath1 . )",
    "while it is unclear how to construct the conjectured superspaces , one can still deduce consequences by assuming their existence . following this reasoning , bossard , howe and stelle",
    "have shown  @xcite that no new divergences should appear at two loops in @xmath1 even after adding matter multiplets  @xcite , were the desired 16-supercharge superspace to exist . in @xmath0",
    "the situation is similar , leading us to the issue of whether the anomaly in the rigid @xmath2 duality symmetry  @xcite might play a role in the appearance of new divergences in matter - multiplet amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "( we note that the study of matter multiplets in supergravity theories and their divergence properties has a long history  @xcite . )    the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite motivated us to compute the coefficients of two - loop four - point divergences in half - maximal supergravity including vector multiplets in @xmath9 to definitively demonstrate that there are nonvanishing divergences in all these dimensions , as well as to give their precise form .",
    "our two - loop @xmath1 result is in direct conflict with the predicted finiteness  @xcite based on assuming the existence of an off - shell 16-supercharge superspace .",
    "we also find a two - loop divergence in @xmath0 after subtracting the one - loop subdivergences .",
    "this two - loop divergence happens to resemble an iteration of the one - loop divergence , so to remove any potential doubts as to whether there are new divergences , we also calculate the complete set of three - loop divergences in @xmath0 , making it clear that there are indeed new divergences .",
    "furthermore , we find that the explicit two- and three - loop @xmath0 results are not of the form required had they been due to the anomaly . from ref .",
    "@xcite , it therefore appears that the desired 16-supercharge superspaces exist in neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for one and two loops in half - maximal supergravity , whenever divergences in the coefficients of certain color tensors are forbidden in gauge theory , divergences also cancel from the corresponding half - maximal supergravity amplitudes .",
    "in particular , the lack of one - loop divergences in dimensions @xmath10 in half - maximal supergravity amplitudes with four external states of the graviton multiplet is a direct consequence of the lack of divergences in those terms in gluon amplitudes proportional to the independent one - loop color tensor .",
    "since the four - scalar amplitude of yang - mills theory coupled to scalars does contain divergences in terms containing the one - loop color tensor even in @xmath0 , the corresponding four - matter multiplet amplitude of @xmath7 supergravity with matter multiplets also diverges .",
    "this is in agreement with the result found long ago by fischler  @xcite and fradkin and tseytlin  @xcite . at two loops",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "the four - point amplitudes with pure external graviton multiplet states are ultraviolet finite in @xmath11 because all corresponding gauge - theory divergences contain only tree - level color tensors .",
    "however , because four - scalar amplitudes of gauge theory , both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , contain divergences in the coefficients of the independent two - loop color tensors , corresponding two - loop four - matter multiplet amplitudes of half - maximal supergravity must also diverge .    at three and higher loops ,",
    "the situation is more complicated because loop momenta appear in the maximal super - yang - mills duality - satisfying numerators , so the supergravity integrals are no longer the same ones as those appearing in gauge theory .",
    "because of this , a link between the divergences of half - maximal supergravity and those of nonsupersymmetric gauge theory will require nontrivial integral identities and remains speculative  @xcite .    to carry out our investigation",
    ", we construct half - maximal supergravity amplitudes via the duality between color and kinematics  @xcite . in this way",
    ", gravity loop integrands are obtained from a pair of corresponding gauge - theory loop integrands .",
    "the key to this construction is to find a representation where one of the two gauge - theory amplitudes manifestly exhibits the duality between color and kinematics .",
    "here we obtain half - maximal supergravity with matter multiplets from a direct product of maximal super - yang - mills theory and nonsupersymmetric yang - mills theory with interacting scalars .",
    "the required two - loop super - yang - mills amplitude in a form where the duality is manifest was given long ago in refs .",
    "@xcite , while the desired form of the three - loop amplitude was given more recently in ref .",

    "once we have the integrands for the amplitudes , we need to extract the ultraviolet singularities .",
    "the basic procedure for doing so has been long understood  @xcite and has been applied recently to a variety of supergravity and super - yang - mills calculations  @xcite . here",

    "the subscript labels on the field strengths indicate the matter multiplet to which the vector state belongs ; these expressions are also valid for @xmath287 , returning the counterterm for a single multiplet up to terms that vanish on shell .",

    "<S> using the duality between color and kinematics , we construct the two- and three - loop amplitudes of half - maximal supergravity with matter multiplets and show that new divergences occur in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> bossard , howe and stelle have recently conjectured the existence of 16-supercharge off - shell harmonic superspaces in order to explain the ultraviolet finiteness of pure half - maximal supergravity with no matter multiplets in @xmath0 at three loops and in @xmath1 at two loops . by assuming the required superspace exists in @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , they argued that no new divergences should occur at two loops even with the addition of abelian - vector matter multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> up to possible issues with the @xmath2 global anomaly of the theory , they reached a similar conclusion in @xmath0 for two and three loops . </S>",
    "<S> the divergences we find contradict these predictions based on the existence of the desired off - shell superspaces . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our @xmath0 results are incompatible with the new divergences being due to the anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two - loop divergences of half - maximal supergravity are directly controlled by the divergences appearing in ordinary nonsupersymmetric yang - mills theory coupled to scalars , explaining why half - maximal supergravity develops new divergences when matter multiplets are added . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a list of one- and two - loop counterterms that should be helpful for constraining any future potential explanations of the observed vanishings of divergences in pure half - maximal supergravity .    </S>",
