    "an ensemble of particle trajectories will maintain a density that is equal to the quantum mechanical probability density @xmath11 if the particle velocities are further constrained to obey the so called _ guidance law _",
    ", @xmath12 even though the quantum potential does have some explanatory usefulness , typically if @xmath13 is known , one only needs to solve the guidance law to obtain the particle trajectories .",
    "the guidance law , in general , is impossible to solve in closed form and must be solved numerically @xcite .    in brandt",
    "@xcite it was shown that the bohm trajectories can be defined by a concept they have named _ quantile motion _ ( a purely non - physical probability concept ) . a unique trajectory is obtained by requiring that the cumulative probability function ( cpf ) for the quantum probability density @xmath11 be constant along the trajectory , @xmath14 where the trajectory is given by @xmath15 .",

    "s equations of motion , the quantile motion solutions can not be obtained in closed form ( except for particular probability densities ) , and therefore , again , must be solved numerically .    in this paper , we present a monte carlo method for a given one - dimensional probability density , that approximates bohm trajectories _ without solving _ either of bohm s equations of motion [ eqs .",
    "( [ qnewton2 ] , [ guidancelaw ] ) ] , or the inverse of the cpf in ( [ cpfeq ] ) . in other words",
    ", our method does _ not _ need to take a derivative or an integral at any point in the process .",
    "this fact demonstrates clear computational advantage over the the typical numerical techniques used to solve eqs .",
    "( [ guidancelaw ] ) and ( [ cpfeq ] ) .",
    "the method takes two parameters : the number of particles in the ensemble @xmath2 , and the size of each discrete time step @xmath16 .",
    "it is shown that the approximate trajectories become the bohm trajectories exactly in the limits @xmath17 and @xmath4 .",
    "a possible extension of the method into higher dimensions is discussed , and it is found that the method can be used to find bohm trajectories for those cases of a separable wave function . finally , we demonstrate the method for the harmonic oscillator , the free particle , and the two - slit experiment .",
    "also provided is a two - dimensional infinite square well example for a separable wave function .",
    "the method assumes that a probability density , @xmath18 , is known and given .",
    "the evolution of the density is depicted by an ensemble of @xmath2 particles , see .",
    "the trajectories of the @xmath2 particles are constructed from locations at times @xmath19 with step size @xmath16 . at each time , the probability density is _ sampled _ to generate a set of @xmath2 possible @xmath20-points .",

    "the @xmath21-th trajectory in the ensemble is built from the @xmath21-th @xmath20-point of the sorted @xmath2 points at each time step .",
    "though there are many ways to generate a set of @xmath2 points sampled from a given distribution @xcite , in the examples below ( ) , we use the von neumann acceptance - rejection method @xcite , see , with a uniform proposal distribution @xmath22 .    the density sampling method . at each time @xmath0 ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath2 points are sampled from the probability density @xmath18 and sorted .",

    "is generated by uniformly placing random dots on the graph .",
    "if a dot is under the density curve , that dot s @xmath20 value is place in the set.,width=288 ]    the quality of the trajectories generated relies on how one chooses the number of particles in the ensemble @xmath2 , and on the size of each time step @xmath16 .",
    "we place the following restrictions for these two parameters , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the width of the domain of the @xmath20 coordinate ( generally this is limited to a range of values where the density is essentially non - zero ) , @xmath27 is a small number @xmath28 with the dimensions of a speed , and @xmath29 is the maximum value of the density for all positions @xmath30 and for all times between the initial and final times .",
    "the method constructs the @xmath21-th trajectory from the @xmath21-th @xmath2 sampled and sorted points at each time step .",
    "the particle trajectories , therefore , do not intersect by design ( a familiar property of bohmian trajectories ) . hence , between successive time steps the approximate size of the maximum change in position @xmath31 is of the order @xmath32 . identifying the density sampled trajectory as @xmath33 , and the bohm trajectory as @xmath34 , we assume at @xmath35 that @xmath36 .",
    "we now describe the density sampled trajectory as @xmath37 for some function @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",

    "while the parameter @xmath2 places the location of the particle close to the actual bohmian location at each time , the other parameter @xmath16 ( the size of each time step ) fixes the density sampled speed approximately equal to the bohm speed .",
    "the difference in the two speeds is on the order of @xmath44 , where again @xmath31 is the size of the fluctuation about the bohmian trajectory . from ( [ ndtconditions ] )",

    "we note that the density sampled trajectory will become the bohm trajectory for @xmath17 and @xmath4 .",
    "in general , the one - dimensional density sampling method described above can not be extended into higher dimensions . in higher dimensions",
    "there is no natural ordering to sort the @xmath2 sampled points , and therefore , no way to identify the @xmath21-th position in the ensemble at each time step like in the one - dimensional case .",
    "however , the quantile motion concept ( [ cpfeq ] ) can be used independently on each coordinate in higher dimensions when the wave function is separable as shown in [ higher ] .",
    "since the one - dimensional density sampled trajectory fluctuates about the bohm trajectory defined by ( [ cpfeq ] ) , the one - dimensional density sampling method can be used independently on each coordinate to generate higher dimensional bohm trajectories for those cases of a separable wave function .",
    "we also note that the method will generate higher dimensional bohm trajectories for wave functions that are nearly separable @xcite , by applying the method independently on each coordinate of the separable part of the wave function .",
    "in the examples below , the probability density is determined in the usual way @xmath11 .",
    "the wave function was chosen to be non - stationary so that @xmath46 .",
    "for comparison , the bohmian trajectories are computed from ( [ guidancelaw ] ) or its equivalent , @xmath47 in all cases , the range @xmath26 of possible position values @xmath20 was limited to an area where the probability density was essentially non - zero . from ( [ ndtconditions ] ) ,",

    "the density sampling method described in this paper shows that one can generate approximate bohmian trajectories without differentiation or integration of any equations of motion .",
    "the method merely evaluates the given probability density at various locations and times .",
    "it uses two adjustable parameters .",

    "it was shown that as @xmath3 and @xmath4 the density sampling method trajectories become the bohm trajectories .",
    "like the quantile motion idea , this method can generate the unique one - dimensional bohmian trajectories without any additional physical assumptions to standard quantum mechanics .",
    "in addition , this method can be used to construct one - dimensional bohmian trajectories for densities where the wave function is unknown or does nt exist ( i.e. , non - quantum problems ) .",
    "further , if a known higher dimensional wave function is separable ( or nearly separable ) , then the method can be applied independently to each coordinate , thus constructing higher dimensional bohmian trajectories as well .",
    "r.e.w . thanks the robert welch foundation for financial support .",
    "the extension of the quantile motion into higher dimensions is also discussed in brandt et al .",
    "@xcite . they show that instead of the total left ( or right ) probability being conserved in one - dimension , that in higher dimensions the probability is conserved inside a volume that is enclosed by a surface of bohmian trajectories .",
    "this property , however , is not unique to bohmian mechanics .",
    "any velocity field @xmath81 will conserve the probability inside the volume in configuration space since @xcite(chapter four ) , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the probability density and @xmath84 is the jacobian such that the volume changes as @xmath85 .",
    "the probability inside this evolving volume is , @xmath86 which implies that @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , any velocity field @xmath81 will conserve the total probability inside a volume that in enclosed by a surface of trajectories solved from @xmath81 .",
    "this is in contrast to what is found in the one - dimensional case , where the velocity field that satisfies the total left ( or right ) probability conservation is unique .",
    "however , the quantile motion concept can be used to generate trajectories in higher dimensions if one uses the marginal distribution for each coordinate analogously to the cumulative probability distribution ( cpf ) in one - dimension .",
    "suppose the system can be described by @xmath2 cartesian coordinates , then the corresponding definition of  ( [ cpfeq ] ) is , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the marginal distribution for the @xmath21-th coordinate .",
    "again , we assume that the particles are conserved so , @xmath90 partially integrating this continuity equation we have that , @xmath91 interchanging the partial derivative with respect to time and performing the @xmath92 integrations , and assuming that the density is zero at @xmath92 , only the @xmath93 integrals on the second term survive , @xmath94 then with the expression above , and differentiating  ( [ newtotalleft ] ) with respect to time , @xmath95 hence , the @xmath21-th coordinate , in general , does nt conserve total left probability of the marginal distribution since @xmath96 could depend on the other coordinates .",
    "suppose , however , that @xmath97 ( i.e. the motion along the @xmath21-th coordinate is independent ) , then @xmath98 , and the total left probability is conserved for the marginal distribution @xmath99 .    in higher dimensional bohmian problems the guidance law ( [ guidancelaw ] ) for the @xmath21-th coordinate becomes , @xmath100",
    "if the wave function is separable , then , @xmath101 the probability density is also separable , @xmath102 , and the phase becomes @xmath103 . which implies that @xmath104 , or that the velocity field for the @xmath21-th coordinate is independent of the other coordinates , for all @xmath105 .",
    "hence , one can use the one - dimensional total left ( or right ) probability conservation , independently for each coordinate , to generate higher - dimensional bohmian trajectories for a separable wave function .",
