    "we denote by @xmath12 the ocean depth at a point @xmath13 at a time @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the corresponding flux .",
    "we have @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the water velocity .",
    "the relative velocity of the waves of the ocean surface is given by @xmath18 we denote by @xmath19 the friction coefficient of strickler and we consider as a simplification purpose that the bottom is flat .",
    "in this configuration , the saint - venant model reads @xmath20 @xmath21 we shall use the representation of waves proposed in  @xcite    is present .",
    "the different states of the same wave are described by a segment of a straight line @xmath22 in the phase plane , that is the plane @xmath23 here .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is a constant which corresponds to the wave velocity , of the form @xmath25 or @xmath26 depending if the wave is travelling eastwards ( sign @xmath27 ) or westwards ( sign @xmath28 ) and for a given reference state @xmath29 with @xmath30 of course .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is also a constant and is determined by the reference state since @xmath32 we denote by @xmath33 the state of the ocean far on the west side , and by @xmath34 the state of the ocean far on the east side . in both cases ,",
    "the distances are supposed to be larger than the reference wavelength @xmath3 proposed in  ( [ roguewave0 ] ) , which allows to use the saint - venant model . we suppose that these states also corresponds to reference velocity equal to zero ;",
    "this assumption is linked to the hypothesis of a flat bottom of the ocean .",
    "that way @xmath33 represents a state @xmath35 and @xmath34 represents a state @xmath36 .",
    "we suppose @xmath37 a difference @xmath38 of a few decimeters is enough even for a wide depth of the ocean .",
    "the profile of the initial state is made of two branches which meet in a state @xmath39 for example at @xmath40 which corresponds to the choice of the origin . from the state @xmath41 to the state @xmath34 , that is on the east side , the profile is decreasing and referred to the state @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding states are so situated on the straight line @xmath42 with @xmath43 as a matter of fact , we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 for this part of the wave profile .",
    "the explicit formulation of the profile is obtained , following  @xcite , by inverting the profile relation @xmath46 where the index @xmath47 stands for east . the inverse profile @xmath48",
    "is determined by integrating @xmath49 we need to have @xmath50 , in order to ensure an increasing profile on the west side , then a decreasing one on the east side .",
    "we get that way a positive flux : @xmath51 , and by writing @xmath52 we get @xmath53 thus @xmath54 by inverting this function @xmath48 and using  ( [ roguewave1 ] ) we get @xmath55 as a decreasing function of @xmath13 which is equal to @xmath56 when @xmath57 for the west side of the profile , with the index @xmath58 , the reference state @xmath59must correspond to a depth satisfying @xmath60 in order to ensure an increasing profile .",
    "the reference velocity associated with the state @xmath61 that is @xmath62 is also the velocity of the west side profile of the wave and is positive .",
    "the straight line representing this west profile in the phase plane has the form @xmath63 and passes by the state @xmath64 .",
    "hence @xmath65 the invert profile is described by a function @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67 with @xmath68 the initial west side profile of the wave is then obtained by inverting , for any @xmath10 , @xmath69 we set @xmath70 to obtain @xmath71 that is @xmath72\\ ] ] with @xmath73 the whole initial profile is now given by  ( [ roguewave3 ] ) for @xmath10 and by  ( [ roguewave1 ] ) for @xmath11 .",
    "it corresponds to an increasing function @xmath74 for @xmath10 and a decreasing one for @xmath11 , which is continuous at @xmath75 where its value is @xmath76 .",
    "1.8emthe wave profile is expected to propagate eastwards , with the respective velocities @xmath77 and @xmath78 which are different for each part west or east .",
    "since the west profile moves lightly faster , the crest of the profile will move up , at the junction of the two parts .",
    "the left side of this crest corresponds to the continuity of the west profile , extropolated for depth values @xmath55 going from @xmath56 to the maximal value @xmath79 .",
    "1.8emthe right part of the crest corresponds to a discontinuity , that is a shock wave , whose location is imposed by the mass conservation . at any time @xmath14 the water contained in the bump under the crest comes from the column of water of length @xmath80shifted since the initial time .",
    "we denote by @xmath81 and @xmath82 the water depths on the left side ( index @xmath83 ) and on the right side ( index @xmath84 ) of the discontinuity , and by @xmath85 its position .",
    "we always have @xmath86 as the west profile is moving with the constant velocity @xmath77 , we get it by simply inverting for any time @xmath14 , the relation @xmath87 for @xmath88 , with the function @xmath66 defined above . by the same way , the east profile is obtained by inverting the relation @xmath89 for @xmath90 , with the function @xmath91 defined above .",
    "for a given time @xmath14 , the depths @xmath92 and @xmath82 , and the shock position @xmath85 are linked by three conditions , entailing three equations .",
    "the first equation says that @xmath81 is the value of the west profile at @xmath93 , that is @xmath94 the second equation says that @xmath82 is the value of the east profile at @xmath93 , that is @xmath95 the third equation is given by the compatibility relation of rankine - hugoniot @xmath96 which ensures the mass conservation .",
    "a dichotomy method running on the parameter @xmath85 allows the simultaneous determination of these three parameters . for practical purposes",
    "it is however easier to determine @xmath85 by checking directly the mass conservation .",
    "let us consider two points @xmath97 and @xmath98 such that @xmath99 if it is not the case in a first choice , one can increase @xmath98 or decrease @xmath97 sufficiently .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the mass of water laying between the two points @xmath97 and @xmath98 at the initial time :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the respectives depths of the west and east profiles .",
    "the same mass @xmath33 has to be found at any time @xmath14 between the two trajectories of equations @xmath103 and @xmath104 which means that the relation @xmath105 always occurs , with @xmath106 we remark that the mass @xmath107 may be explicitely calculated from the relation @xmath108 where @xmath109 this calculation involves only primitives of rationnal fractions .",
    "more simply , using the computing files giving @xmath101 on the west side of a point @xmath110 and @xmath102 on the east side of this point @xmath110 , one can compute @xmath111 and next determine @xmath112 such that    @xmath113    by noticing that @xmath114 is an increasing function .",
    "1.8emthis last process has been used to compute the results shown on the figure above . for this example , we have taken @xmath115 and @xmath116 , then @xmath79 at its maximal value , that is @xmath117 here .",
    "this choice leads to the value of @xmath56 , which is @xmath118 here .",
    "the friction coefficient was taken equal to @xmath119 we have to notice that the value of the friction coefficient is strongly linked to the wavelength of the profiles since the smallest frictions give the larger wavelengths . for terrestrial hydraulic flows ( rivers or estuaries for example ) the values of the friction coefficient is far smaller , of the order of @xmath120 but corresponds to far less deep flows .",
    "it seems natural to consider that for larger depths this parameter has to be upgraded . at the time @xmath121 ,",
    "the shock amplitude @xmath122 reaches the value @xmath123 , between the two cells adjascent to the computed position of @xmath85 .",
    "the relative error on the mass is of order of @xmath124 ( mainly due to the meshsize ) , and the trajectories  ( [ roguewave4 ] ) and  ( [ roguewave5 ] ) were approached by a simple trapezoid formula , since the depth has a small variation along the trajectories @xmath125 and @xmath126 when they are chosen relatively far from the shock .",
    "2.1emby upgrading lightly the value of @xmath127 , one get more important shock amplitudes . for the next example , with @xmath128 , we obtain the values @xmath129 and @xmath130 . the computed shock amplitude @xmath122 is equal to @xmath131 .",
    "the wave crest culminates at more than 50 meters above the sea level .",
    "we propose a graphic interpretation in the phase plane @xmath23 using the picture below .",
    "1.8emthe states @xmath34 and @xmath33 are represented on the @xmath132axis .",
    "the line passing through @xmath34 corresponds to the east wave , of equation @xmath133 .",
    "the line passing through @xmath33 corresponds to the west wave , of equation @xmath134 .",
    "these two lines meet at the point @xmath41 .",
    "the shock wave is represented by the segment @xmath135 , with @xmath136 sliding along the west wave line , from @xmath41 to @xmath61 and @xmath137 sliding along the east wave line , from @xmath41 to @xmath34 .",
    "this segment @xmath135 is not exactly a straight one , and its equation is obtained from the rankine hugoniot condition  ( [ englishgwagoufall6 ] ) .",
    "the maximal amplitude is reached when the first event between @xmath136 reaching @xmath61 or @xmath137 reaching @xmath34 occurs .",
    "after that time the wave is expected to collapse .",
    "the scaling of the picture has been strongly modified for readability , since in the real example all those lines are so close to one another that it is impossible to perceive any difference .",
    "this study shows that the outbreak of these waves is due to a differential in the pressure field , resulting from two waves with different profiles , with close but different velocities and sufficiently large wavelengths .",
    "the water is pushed up from this pressure effect together with a friction effect .",
    "the later behaviour is not studied here : one expects that , when @xmath81 reaches the la value @xmath79 ( which occurs in a finite time ) , a backwards wave will appear , with a negative velocity , and will provoke strong perturbations on the west profile near the wave crest , which will collapse soon .",
    "however this backwards wave will have a shorter wavelength , probably too small to fit up with the use of the saint - venant model , as described by the condition  ( [ roguewave0 ] ) .",
    "1.8emanother remaining work is to fit out the different parameters in order to be in accordance with real world observations .",
    "we also outline the strong sensitivity of the difference @xmath38 on the hight of the wave crest , and then on the shock amplitude .",
    "a little more important difference between @xmath127 and @xmath138 causes noticeably more important shock amplitudes .",
    "we have only proposed empirical choices of the parameters , in order to get realistic results showing that this study may be a suitable way to understand the shaping of rogue waves .",
    "we emphasize the friction plays here a fundamental role since it allows a linear behaviuor of the west and the east waves .",
    "1.8emanother idea to retain is a new example of the application of the notion of source waves after the roll waves in channels and rivers , the tidal bore waves in the estuaries , the surf waves on the shore near the beach , the hurricanes and tsunamis ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "1.8emthe authors thank michel olagnon from ifremer - brest for some useful answers by e - mail .",
    "reading for example  @xcite or  @xcite is also very instructive for the description of the phenomenon of rogue waves and starting some bibliography research .",
    "it appears that a discussion on either the linear character or the non linear character of the waves is spreading . in this study",
    "we put together both characters since linearity is introduced through the source term , that is the friction term , with different parameters on the two sides of the wave , and the nonlinearity effect is present in the shockwave , linking the two sides of the wave .",
