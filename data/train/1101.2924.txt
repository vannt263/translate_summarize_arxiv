    "in euclidean geometry , all triangles have a unique incircle ( inscribed circle ) and a unique circumcircle ( cirumscribed circle ) . in taxicab geometry ,",
    "the shape of a circle changes to a rotated square @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is a logical question whether the euclidean incircle and circumcircle theorems for triangles still hold .",
    "we will see that only under certain conditions do these circles exist in the traditional sense .",
    "when describing angle sizes we will use the definition of a t - radian @xcite which is the natural analogue in taxicab geometry of the radian in euclidean geometry .",
    "in euclidean geometry , all angles less than @xmath0 radians can be represented as an inscribed angle .",
    "this is not the case in taxicab geometry ( see figure [ uninscribedangle ] ) .",
    "this simple fact has far reaching consequences regarding inscribed and circumscribed circles for triangles . and ,",
    "since the position of an angle plays a role in whether the angle is inscribed , we will begin with a number of definitions for different types of inscribed angles in taxicab geometry .",
    "a taxicab angle is _ positively inscribed _ if a line of slope 1 through its vertex remains outside the angle .",
    "a taxicab angle is _ negatively inscribed _ if a line of slope -1 through its vertex remains outside the angle .",
    "a taxicab angle is _ inscribed _ if it is positively inscribed , negatively inscribed , or both .",
    "a taxicab angle is _ completely inscribed _ if it is both positively inscribed and negatively inscribed .",
    "a taxicab angle is _ strictly positively inscribed _ if it is positively inscribed but not negatively inscribed .",
    "similarly , a taxicab angle is _ strictly negatively inscribed _ if it is negatively inscribed but not positively inscribed .    from the examples in figure [ inscribedangles ]",
    "it is clear that both the size of an angle and its position affect whether it is inscribed .",
    "some angles just larger than 2 t - radians are not inscribed while other angles just smaller than 4 t - radians are inscribed .    while not the focus of this investigation , it should be noted that the inscribed angle theorem from euclidean geometry does not hold in taxicab geometry .",
    "figure [ inscribedangletheorem ] illustrates two scenarios where the ratio of the inscribed angle to the central angle subtended by the same arc is different . in the left figure , @xmath1 has measure 1 t - radian and @xmath2 has measure 2 t - radians . in the right figure , @xmath1 again has measure 1 t - radian but @xmath2 has measure 2.5 t - radians .",
    "triangles with one or more inscribed angles have special properties",
    ". a number of these will be needed in our investigation of taxicab triangle circumcircles and incircles .",
    "[ neighboringanglestheorem ] if a triangle contains a strictly positively inscribed angle , then the other angles are negatively inscribed .",
    "if an angle @xmath1 of a triangle is strictly positively inscribed , then for a neighboring angle to not be negatively inscribed it would have to be larger than @xmath3 t - radians ( see figure [ positiveneighbor ] ) thus violating the angle requirements of a triangle in taxicab geometry ( theorem 14 of @xcite ) .",
    "[ neighboringanglescorollary ] if a triangle contains a strictly negatively inscribed angle , then the other angles are positively inscribed .",
    "a triangle with a completely inscribed angle can only take on certain shapes and positions .",
    "adding additional completely inscribed angles results in a very small class of triangles as the following theorem ilustrates .",
    "[ threeinscribedanglestheorem ] a triangle has three completely inscribed angles if and only if two of its sides have slope -1 or slope 1 .",
    "suppose @xmath1 and @xmath4 are completely inscribed angles at vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 of a triangle .",
    "without loss of generality , suppose @xmath1 is inscribed such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 have slope between -1 and 1 with @xmath7 having a slope strictly less than 1 ( figure [ threeinscribedangles ] ) .",
    "since @xmath4 is also completely inscribed , the slope of @xmath9 is between -1 and 1 , inclusive .",
    "if the slope of @xmath9 is strictly less than 1 , then there exists a line of slope 1 through c passing through the angle @xmath10 making it not positively inscribed .",
    "similarly , if the slope of @xmath8 is strictly greater than -1 , then there exists a line of slope -1 through c passing through the angle @xmath10 making it not negatively inscribed .",
    "therefore , the triangle has three completely inscribed angles if and only if the rays of angle @xmath10 have slope 1 and -1 .",
    "triangles whose angles are all inscribed will be of great interest to us . having a term for this type of triangle will be useful and , in the end , meaningful . while it may seem presumptuous , calling such a triangle an inscribed triangle will be fully justified by the results that follow .",
    "a triangle is _ inscribed _ if all of its angles are inscribed .",
    "exploring some properties of inscribed triangles will aid in our study of taxicab triangle circumcircles and incircles .",
    "there are minimal properties that an inscribed triangle must have .",
    "in fact , by imposing the restriction that all three angles must be inscribed , a more stringent condition results .",
    "the following theorem illustrates one of the more fundamental and useful properties of an inscribed triangle .",
    "[ onecompletelyinscribedtheorem ] an inscribed triangle has at least one completely inscribed angle .    by way of contradiction and without loss of generality ,",
    "assume a triangle has a strictly positively inscribed angle @xmath1 .",
    "by theorem [ neighboringanglestheorem ] the neighboring angles must be negatively inscribed .",
    "suppose one of these angles @xmath4 is strictly negatively inscribed",
    ". then by corollary [ neighboringanglescorollary ] , the other angles must be positively inscribed .",
    "so , @xmath10 is completely inscribed ( figure [ onecompletelyinscribed ] ) .",
    "therefore , an inscribed triangle can not be constructed with no completely inscribed angles .",
    "the following theorem is an extension and generalization of theorem [ neighboringanglestheorem ] where a hint of alternating inscribed angle properties among the angles of a triangle was seen .",
    "theorem [ onecompletelyinscribedtheorem ] above provides the flexibility in obtaining the following result .",
    "the alternating property in an inscribed triangle is key to the construction of taxicab circumcircles for triangles .",
    "[ neighboroppositetheorem ] neighboring angles of an inscribed triangle have opposite inscribed angle properties ( completely inscribed angles may be selected to be either positively or negatively inscribed as needed ) .",
    "if an angle of a triangle is strictly positively inscribed , then by theorem [ neighboringanglestheorem ] the other angles are negatively inscribed . by theorem [ onecompletelyinscribedtheorem ] one of these angles must be completely inscribed .",
    "therefore , neighboring angles in this triangle have opposite inscribed angle properties .",
    "the result is similar when beginning with a strictly negatively inscribed angle .",
    "the only remaining case is a triangle with only completely inscribed angles .",
    "the result follows immediately .",
    "the traditional definition of a triangle circumcircle , or circumscribed circle , is a circle that passes through the vertex points of the triangle . in euclidean geometry ,",
    "all triangles have a unique circumcircle . in taxicab geometry ,",
    "the existence of circumcircles is more restrictive .    _ * ( triangle circumcircle theorem ) * _ a triangle has a taxicab circumcircle if and only if it is an inscribed triangle .",
    "if a taxicab circumcircle passes through the vertices of a triangle and completely encloses the triangle , by definition the angles of the triangle are inscribed since a taxicab circle is composed of lines of slope 1 and -1 .    to prove the converse , suppose the triangle is an inscribed triangle . by theorem [ neighboroppositetheorem ] neighboring angles of the triangle",
    "have opposite inscribed angle properties .",
    "therefore , we may select three lines of slope 1 or -1 through the vertices of the triangle in an alternating fashion to construct three sides of a taxicab circle around the triangle .",
    "since at least one angle of the triangle is completely inscribed , this can be done in multiple ways . at the completely inscribed angle",
    ", a line should be selected that maximizes the side of the circle enclosed by the 3 lines ( the solid lines of figure [ circumcircle ] , with the dotted lines showing the alternate choice ) . by construction",
    ", the fourth side of the taxicab circle will enclose the triangle .",
    "the triangle circumcircle theorem justifies our name for inscribed triangles .",
    "this type of triangle is precisely the kind for which circumscribed circles exist . from this result , we can easily obtain the taxicab version of the euclidean geometry `` 3 points define a unique circle '' theorem previously investigated from other perspectives in @xcite . in particular , the concepts of inscribed angles and triangles are intimately connected with the gradual , steep , and separator lines of the main theorem of @xcite .    _ * ( three - point circle theorem ) * _ three non - collinear points lie on a unique taxicab circle if and only if the triangle they form is inscribed .",
    "as noted by sowell @xcite , taxicab triangle circumcircles are not necessarily unique .",
    "all non - unique cases occur when one or more sides of the circumcircle pass through two vertices .",
    "this often creates flexibility in defining possible circumcircles .",
    "three cases are shown in figure [ infinitecircumcircles ] . in the first example",
    ", exactly one side has a slope of 1 or -1 and the other sides are of equal taxicab length and longer than the first side ( noting that the triangle does not necessarily need to be acute ) . in this case",
    "a circumcircle can be shifted diagonally within a limited range around the triangle . for the second example",
    ", one side has slope 1 or -1 and another side is parallel to an axis .",
    "larger and larger circles encompass this type of triangle .",
    "these circles also encompass the third example along with another set of circles in a limited range of movement as in the first example . in this case",
    "the triangle is isoceles ( but not equilateral ) with two sides having slope 1 or -1 .",
    "the traditional definition of a triangle incircle is the largest circle inscribed within the triangle that is tangent to all three sides of the triangle .",
    "such a circle is guaranteed to exist in euclidean geometry . as with circumcircles",
    ", a taxicab triangle incircle only exists under certain conditions .",
    "we begin by formalizing the definition of an incircle in taxicab geometry to clear up concepts like `` tangent '' which may not transfer precisely .    a taxicab triangle _ incircle _ , or inscribed circle , is a taxicab circle entirely contained in a triangle with three of its corners touching the sides of the triangle .    _ * ( triangle incircle theorem ) * _ a triangle has a unique taxicab incircle if and only if it is an inscribed triangle .",
    "let @xmath11 be an inscribed triangle . by theorem [ onecompletelyinscribedtheorem ] , the triangle has at least one completely inscribed angle . without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath10 be an inscribed angle in the triangle at vertex @xmath12 such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 have slope between -1 and 1 , inclusive ( figure [ incircle ] ) .",
    "if the triangle has three inscribed angles , choose @xmath10 to be the angle at the intersection of the lines with slope 1 and -1 ( see theorem [ threeinscribedanglestheorem ] ) .",
    "for the side @xmath7 of the triangle opposite @xmath10 , consider a point @xmath13 with distance from @xmath6    @xmath14    the distance from @xmath5 to @xmath13 is    @xmath15    the arcs of taxicab circles of radius @xmath16 and @xmath17 centered on a and b , respectively , intersect @xmath7 at the same point @xmath13 and by the arc length theorem 6 of @xcite both have a length across the interior of the triangle of    @xmath18    therefore , these arcs form half a taxicab circle inside the triangle .",
    "the other half of the taxicab circle remains inside the triangle because the slope of the lines forming the circle are by assumption greater than the slopes of the lines forming the side of the triangle they intersect .    to prove the converse ,",
    "assume a triangle has a taxicab incircle .",
    "if one or zero sides of the circle overlap the triangle ( as in figure [ incircle ] ) , both sides of each angle of the triangle are intersected by a line of slope -1 or 1 .",
    "this implies a line of the same slope passing through the vertex will remain outside the angle making each angle inscribed .",
    "if two sides of the circle overlap the triangle , the enclosed angle is by definition completely inscribed .",
    "the other two angles are inscribed by the argument above .",
    "therefore , the triangle is an inscribed triangle .    for a triangle that is not inscribed",
    ", an inscribed taxicab circle still exists in a sense , as noted in passing by sowell @xcite .",
    "the enclosed circle technically fails to be an incircle by our definition because it does not touch some of the sides of the triangle ( see figure [ notinscribedtriangle ] ) .",
    "the problem centers on the fact that the triangle is significantly `` wider '' than it is `` tall '' and taxicab circles are in a sense not as `` flexible '' as euclidean circles .",
    "while taxicab incircles and circumcircles exist for some taxicab triangles , their existence is not guaranteed .",
    "the size and position of the angles of the triangle affect the existence of such circles with the concept of inscribed angles being the defining characteristic .",
    "the inscribed angles requirement is perhaps present in other geometries such as euclidean geometry , but it may not be as well noted in cases where all angles are inscribed ."
