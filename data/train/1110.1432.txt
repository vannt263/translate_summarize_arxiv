    "a critical problem in homeland security is reliable and rapid identification of unknown chemical and biological substances in the explosives . due to the harmful environment caused by the release of the explosive chemicals , non",
    "- destructive spectroscopic techniques are typically used to record the optical spectrum without interfering with the samples .",
    "ideally , a standoff detection is performed to acquire the spectral information .",
    "then a search and matching procedure through a prepared spectral database will be carried out for identification .",
    "however such an approach would be unsuccessful if the explosives contained chemical compounds outside of the database , which is highly likely as hidden explosives are often unknown a - priori .",
    "in general , the samples may involve multiple unknown substances besides impurities .",
    "conventional analysis routines are mostly based on least squares fitting whose residuals could remain mysterious .",
    "further analysis calls for the development of blind identification methods to extract major components from the residuals .    various recent experimental techniques ( see @xcite and the references therein ) can identify pure chemicals with notable success .",
    "these methods are mainly based on raman spectroscopy , a spectroscopic technique to study the chemical composition of the samples @xcite . combined with other spectroscopic techniques such as ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy",
    ", raman spectroscopy has been widely used in materials science , biosciences , geosciences ( gemology ) , forensic sciences , nano - technology , and pharmaceutical chemistry @xcite .",
    "for example , the swept wavelength optical resonant raman detector ( sworrd ) at the naval research laboratory developed in 2009 can generate two dimensional spectral maps of biological agents and chemical substances .",
    "the resultant two dimensional signatures contain much more information than the single illumination wavelengths , which may result in a greater likelihood of successful identification even in complex mixtures @xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy is based on raman scattering , an inelastic scattering process that shifts the frequencis of the incident photons . during the interaction of the incident light with a molecule ,",
    "a scattered light of lower ( stokes raman ) or higher ( anti - stokes raman ) energy is emitted , allowing the measurements of the molecule s vibrational modes .",
    "the appeals of this technique are non - destructiveness and fast sensing capability .",
    "it has become a promising tool for standoff distance detection for explosives at airports among other transportation centers .    in general , raman spectra of a sample",
    "are composed of many substances , and they must be identified by an analysis software . if one has the complete knowledge of the kinds of substances in the sample , the least squares fitting can be used to retrieve their concentrations ( or volumes ) by a linear combination of the known spectra on a template . in most practical situations ,",
    "one may have to identify the substances and quantify their concentrations at the same time .",
    "this becomes a blind source separation ( bss ) problem , or recovering pure signal sources from their mixtures without a detailed knowledge of the mixing process .",
    "there have been several studies on the bss of raman spectra @xcite based on independent component analysis ( ica , @xcite ) and nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf , @xcite )",
    ". however these methods are non - convex and too general to be robust and reliable in real - world applications .",
    "the independence hypothesis of ica does not hold if chemicals share some common structures and have correlated raman spectral line shapes .",
    "moreover , these existing approaches do not address how to identify unknown substances from the fitting residuals when partial knowledge of the source signals is available .",
    "such a semi - blind problem is more often encountered in applications and of great importance to practitioners .    in this paper",
    ", we shall develop a convex semi - blind source separation method based on sparsity of the source spectra .",
    "we are concerned with the regime where the sample contains some known and some unknown components . in other words , we have knowledge of some of the components and their concentrations , which is the case of the sworrd data .. we further assume that the upper bound of the concentrations of the known substances is available , say from experiments or prior knowledge , as is the case of sworrd data . though our method here is designed for raman spectra , it is applicable to spectra with similar line shapes , such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) data , see @xcite where more general sparseness source conditions and post - processing methods have been studied . a similar semi - blind source identification approach has been developed for mysterious species of the atmospheric gas mixtures @xcite .    our method in the paper",
    "may provide an assistive tool for practitioners to analyze the hidden structures from residuals of fitting complicated mixtures .",
    "the method contains two major steps .",
    "the first step decomposes raman data @xmath0 into a linear combination of the reference spectra ( known components ) plus a remainder , or @xmath1 , where the columns of matrix @xmath2 are known reference spectra , the matrix @xmath3 contains the non - negative concentrations and has known upper bound . the first step is carried out by solving a constrained least squares problem .",
    "the constraints on @xmath3 help to maintain the nonnegativity of remainder matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the second step performs a nonnegative blind source separation of the remainder matrix @xmath4 to extract the unknown components .",
    "we show that proper sparsity of source signals reduces the general non - convex problem to constrained convex programming permitting solutions with better mathematical properties .",
    "sparse solutions to convex objectives are achieved through @xmath5 norm minimization and a fast iterative method ( the linearized bregman ) .",
    "the two steps may be iterated .",
    "if some of the components from step two are confirmed as chemically meaningful , they are fed back to step one to refine the residual for further extraction of hidden components in step 2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the source sparseness condition and our method . in section 3 ,",
    "we illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of sworrd experimental data , and show satisfactory numerical results .",
    "conclusion and future works are discussed in section 4 .",
    "this work was partially supported by nsf - adt grant dms-0911277 .",
    "the authors thank naval research laboratory for the experimental raman data and dr .",
    "j. grun for helpful discussions .",
    "in this section , we shall present our method for chemicals detection in raman spectroscopy . based on the assumption that part of the substances in the chemical mixture and the upper bounds of their concentrations are known , the first step of the method fits these known chemicals to the mixtures .",
    "this step solves a constrained least squares optimization .",
    "the following linear model is used for raman spectra of mixtures @xmath6 where the columns of matrix @xmath0 are the measured raman data , the columns of @xmath2 contain reference spectra of the known chemicals , and those of @xmath3 matrix contains their concentrations .",
    "matrix @xmath4 is the fitting residual which might contain hidden spectral structures , the instrument noise , etc .",
    "matrix @xmath3 is nonnegative on physical ground that its entries represent concentrations .",
    "furthermore , the upper bound of @xmath3 is known _",
    "a priori_. then for the estimation of @xmath3 , we minimize the following constrained objective function : @xmath7 where the vector @xmath8 contains the upper bounds of the concentrations of the known substances in the sample . for the raman data in our numerical experiments , we found that the linear constraint in ( [ convexmodel ] ) helps to maintain a nonnegative remainder @xmath9 . in the residual @xmath4",
    ", there might be spectral structures ( one or many ) of chemicals buried in noise , or just random noise . in either case",
    ", we factorize the residuals in a blind fashion due to the lack of knowledge of the hidden components .",
    "conventional blind source separation methods such as nmf and ica are non - convex optimization methods .",
    "these methods are for general purpose , yet often unreliable in real - world applications due to non - convexity or sensitivity of their working assumptions . for our problem , we show that proper sparsity of source signals reduces the general non - convex problem to constrained convex programming permitting solutions with better mathematical properties .",
    "sparse solutions to convex objectives are achieved through @xmath5 minimization .",
    "the remainder matrix @xmath4 is factorized as : @xmath10 where the columns of the matrix @xmath11 are the identified substances , @xmath12 is their concentrations in the sample .",
    "all the matrices are nonnegative . for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we shall call @xmath13 the source matrix , @xmath14 the mixing matrix .",
    "the dimensions of the matrices are expressed in terms of three numbers : ( 1 ) @xmath15 the number of available samples , ( 2 ) @xmath16 the number of mixture signals , and ( 3 ) @xmath17 the number of source signals . for the raman data we considered in the paper ,",
    "there are more mixtures than sources , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the goal is to recover @xmath11 and @xmath12 for a given @xmath4 .",
    "this is also known as an nmf problem .",
    "various methods have been developed to solve bss problems by exploiting the natures of source signals .",
    "for example , independent component analysis ( ica ) recovers statistically independent signals .",
    "however , the independence should not be assumed on the raman spectra of the chemical substances when they share common structural features ( the line shapes of their raman spectra are similar ) . a better working assumption for the data is a so - called partial sparseness condition .",
    "namely , the source signals are only required to be non - overlapping at some locations of acquisition variable .",
    "this sparseness condition was first known in the 1990s @xcite in the study of blind hyper - spectral unmixing of remote sensing , where the source condition is called pixel purity assumption ( ppa ) @xcite . in 2005 ,",
    "naanaa and nuzillard @xcite used this assumption to separate the signals in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy .",
    "in fact , this condition is well suited to many chemical substances including those studied in this paper .",
    "such a sparseness condition leads to a dramatic mathematical simplification of a general non - negative matrix factorization problem ( [ modelr ] ) which is non - convex . geometrically speaking",
    ", the problem of finding the mixing matrix @xmath12 reduces to the identification of a minimal cone containing the rows of matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the latter can be achieved by linear programming . in the context of hyper - spectral unmixing , the resulting geometric ( cone )",
    "method is the so called n - findr @xcite , and is now a benchmark in hyper - spectral unmixing .",
    "next we shall review the essentials of the partial spareness condition and the geometric cone method .",
    "simply speaking , the key sparseness assumption on the source signals is that each source has a stand alone peak at some location of acquisition variable where the other sources are zero .",
    "more precisely , the source matrix @xmath19 is assumed to satisfy the following condition :    for each @xmath20 there exists an @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23    eq .",
    "( [ modelr ] ) can be rewritten in terms of rows as @xmath24 where @xmath25 denote the @xmath26th row of @xmath4 , and @xmath27 the @xmath28th row of @xmath12 .",
    "the source assumption implies that @xmath29 or @xmath30 . hence eq .",
    "( [ lincomb ] ) is rewritten as @xmath31 which says that every row of @xmath4 is a nonnegative linear combination of the rows of @xmath12 .",
    "the identification of @xmath32 s rows is equivalent to identifying a convex cone of a finite collection of vectors .",
    "the cone encloses the data rows in matrix @xmath4 , and is the smallest of such cones .",
    "such a minimal enclosing convex cone can be found by linear programming methods .",
    "mathematically , the following optimization problems are suggested to estimate the mixing matrix @xmath33 a score is associated with each row of @xmath4 .",
    "a row with a low score is unlikely to be a row of @xmath12 because this row is roughly a nonnegative linear combination of the other rows of @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    ", a high score means that the corresponding row is far from being a nonnegative linear combination of other rows .",
    "the @xmath17 rows from @xmath4 with highest scores are selected to form @xmath12 , the mixing matrix .",
    "with the recovery of @xmath12 , we solve for @xmath11 next .",
    "an existing method @xcite is to directly compute @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the pseudo - inverse of @xmath12 .",
    "it is however sensitive to noise , and tends to introduce errors and artifacts of negative values .",
    "although a nonnegative least squares can produce a nonnegative @xmath11 , spurious peaks might be introduced in the results . to benefit from the sparseness source condition in the first step , a more reliable method is to solve a nonnegative @xmath5 optimization .",
    "although the source signals ( columns of @xmath11 ) are not sparse , the rows of @xmath11 possess sparsity .",
    "hence , we seek the sparsest solution for each row @xmath36 of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath37 here @xmath38 ( 0-norm ) represents the number of nonzeros .",
    "because of the non - convexity of the 0-norm , we minimize the @xmath5-norm as a convex relaxation : @xmath39 which is in the form of linear programming .",
    "the fact that the data may in general contain noise suggests us to solve the following unconstrained optimization problem , @xmath40 for which bregman iterative method @xcite with a proper projection onto non - negative convex subset is used to obtain a solution . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the linearized bregman iteration to solve ( [ loneu ] ) due to its efficiency . for each row @xmath36 of @xmath11",
    ", we introduce @xmath41 , then ( [ loneu ] ) is equivalent to @xmath42 the @xmath43 norm in ( [ loneu],[linbreg ] ) is to model the unknown measurement error or noise as gaussian . when there is minimal measurement error",
    ", one must assign a tiny value to @xmath44 to heavily weigh the fidelity term @xmath45 in order for @xmath46 to be nearly satisfied .",
    "the linearized bregman method can be written iteratively by introducing an auxiliary variable @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the step size , and @xmath51 is for computing nonnegative solutions , @xmath52",
    "in this section , we shall apply our method to the so - called sworrd raman data provided by the naval research laboratory , and present the computational results .",
    "the swept wavelength optical resonant raman detector ( sworrd ) at the naval research laboratory is a spectroscopy system which is able to produce two dimensional spectral data of biological agents and chemical substances .",
    "a target substance is illuminated with a specific laser wavelength and this generates a resonance raman spectrum . when the laser wavelength is varied and the process is repeated , the resonance raman spectra ( one at each laser wavelength ) , forms a two - dimensional plot ( signature ) where one axis is the input laser wavelength and the other axis is the wavenumber of the raman spectrum .",
    "[ raman_mix4 ] is an example of 2d sworrd raman spectra of a mixture of ethanol , ethylene glycol , acetonitrile , and water .",
    "the data matrix @xmath0 corresponds to this 2d spectra .",
    "each column @xmath0 is a raman spectrum of the mixture at a specific laser wavelength . for sworrd data ,",
    "there are much more mixtures than the number of sources .",
    "the spectral features may be slightly altered from one wavelength to another . to reduce this effect",
    ", we do not necessarily use all the data , and so we sample the spectra at a subset of input laser wavelengths .",
    "we report here the computational results from our proposed method .",
    "we tested our method on two sets of sworrd data .",
    "the samples consist of several liquid substances , some of them are commonly used for synthesizing explosives .",
    "the first data set includes 21 mixed raman spectra at different excitation wavelengths .",
    "this sample is known to contain methanol and its concentration is below @xmath53 .",
    "there are also two _ a - priori _ unknown liquid chemicals .",
    "the method first fits the known reference spectrum of methanol to the raman data .",

    "conventional method such as nmf tends to lose reliability in dealing with the data , the nmf results are also presented as a comparison . in the second example , we try to identify two hidden chemicals from a mixture of four chemicals .",
