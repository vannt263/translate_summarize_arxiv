    "type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are thought to arise from the explosion of massive ( @xmath12 ) stars which end their lives with a substantial fraction of hydrogen in their envelopes .",
    "the explosion is triggered by the collapse of the progenitor s core .",
    "the best - understood core - collapse events are the sne iip ( plateau ) , whose light curves are nearly flat during the first @xmath13 months . the long duration of the light curve plateau is believed to be due to the presence of a massive ( @xmath14 ) hydrogen envelope ( e.g. , falk @xmath15 arnett 1977 ) .",
    "after the plateau , the light curves of sne iip are often dominated by radioactive decay of @xmath3co .",
    "the cobalt is the decay product of @xmath3ni , and the luminosity at this epoch can therefore be used to estimate the amount of @xmath3ni ejected at the explosion .",
    "because the nickel is produced in the core region , the mass of ejected @xmath3ni is an important probe of the core - collapse scenario itself , the nucleosynthetic yields of sne ii and their progenitors , and the nature of the compact central object formed at the collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a new subclass of core - collapse supernovae has recently emerged : the narrow - line supernovae or sne iin ( schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 ) . like other sne ii they show strong balmer lines , but the lines are narrow ( @xmath16 ) and are seen in emission rather than absorption even at early times .",
    "sn 1994w was discovered on 1994 july 29 in the sbc galaxy ngc 4041 ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on the presence of hydrogen lines it was quickly classified as a sn ii ( bragaglia , munari , & barbon 1994 ) .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy showed that the lines had unusually narrow p - cygni profiles ( @xmath17 ) with broad emission wings , but no broad absorption component ( @xcite ; cumming , lundqvist , & meikle 1994 ) .",
    "reports in iau circulars indicated that the supernova reached a maximum of @xmath18 around 1994 aug 13 .",
    "further photometry by tsvetkov ( 1995 ) showed that the supernova was a sn iip , and had a remarkably sharp drop in the @xmath19 and @xmath2 light curves in early november 1994 .",
    "in this paper we present further photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 1994w taken on several occasions between 1994 july 31 to 1996 april 20 .",
    "we focus on the low luminosity of the supernova after @xmath20 days , and interpret this as due to an exceptionally low mass of ejected @xmath3ni .",
    "we also discuss the formation of the narrow lines .",
    "our photometric data were obtained mainly in @xmath4 on six occasions from 1994 november 16 to 1996 april 20 , using the jakobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) and the nordic optical telescope ( not ) on la palma ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the data were bias subtracted and flat fielded using standard procedures within iraf .",
    "differential magnitudes between the supernova and comparison stars were measured using polyfit ( spnnare 1997 ) , which is a software package developed to do photometry on uneven backgrounds : a point spread function ( psf ) is produced by fitting a moffat function to an isolated star in the frame .",
    "this psf and a polynomial fit to the background are then simultaneously fitted at the position of the object . for the jkt nights a bright comparison star was in the field and",
    "was used for the relative magnitudes . for the not data a fainter comparison star had to be used . up",
    "to seven comparison stars were monitored to avoid variability .",
    "the comparison stars were calibrated against landolt stars ( landolt 1983 , 1992 ) at two nights on jkt and against a standard field in ngc 4147 ( christian et al .",
    "1985 ) for the not observations .",
    "the zero point for the @xmath4 magnitude differs slightly between the 4 photometric nights .",
    "we estimate a total systematic error of 0.15 mag in the @xmath4 magnitude , including the neglect of color transformations and differential atmospheric extinction corrections , which were only applied to the day 646   data . for the @xmath2 magnitude we calibrated relative to local standards measured by tsvetkov ( 1995 ) .",
    "the jkt observations have rather low signal to noise or poor seeing , which gives large errors for the photometry , @xmath210.5 mag . for the not observation ( day 197 )",
    "the error is smaller , and dominated by the error in the polyfit measurement .",
    "we estimated this error by adding to the image ten artificial stars of the same magnitude as the supernova at similar backgrounds using the iraf task addstar .",
    "the rms error in the polyfit measurements of these were @xmath22  mag , which we regard as the measurement error also for the supernova .",
    "a total error of 0.3 mag on day 197 is therefore rather generous and includes errors for the comparison stars . at the last observation ,",
    "day 646 , the supernova was not detected .",
    "we estimated an upper limit by subtracting artificial psfs of different brightness until a hole appeared in the background at the supernova position .",
    "our spectroscopic observations cover five epochs from day 18 to day 202 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the data were bias subtracted , flat fielded and wavelength calibrated using iraf . the day 31 , 57 and 202",
    "spectra were flux calibrated against a spectrophotometric standard star .",
    "the day 57 spectrum was taken at high airmass and required further corrections for slit losses . a rough flux calibration for the day 18 spectrum was obtained by comparison with contemporary visual photometry and the spectrum on day 31 .",
    "the day 121 spectrum was flux calibrated using the @xmath4 photometry from day 125 .",
    "in figure 1 we present the light curve of sn 1994w . from the early @xmath4 data",
    ", we estimate the date of optical outburst to have been 1994 july 14@xmath23 , and we label observations by number of days after this .",
    "the light curve shows a relatively gentle rise to maximum around 30 days , followed by a slow , plateau - like decline until @xmath24 days .",
    "the slow decline in @xmath19 and @xmath2 is typical of a sn iip . at @xmath24 days , however , the supernova started to fade unprecedentedly fast , dropping by @xmath1 magnitudes in @xmath2 in only 12 days . also on the light curve tail ,",
    "the fading continued at a fast rate , until our last photometric detection on day 197 .",
    "we could not detect the supernova in @xmath2 or @xmath4 on day 646 .",
    "the spectrum of the supernova was also unusual for a sn ii . before the light curve drop , the spectra on days 18 , 31 and 57 ( see figs",
    ". 2 and 3 ) , show the strong p - cygni lines of @xmath25 , typical of a sn ii , but with very narrow profiles ( minima at @xmath26 and maximum blue velocities of only @xmath27 ) .",
    "in addition to the narrow features , the @xmath25 lines had emission wings extending out to @xmath28 , a factor of @xmath29 lower than the maximum velocities normally seen in sne ii at these epochs .",
    "the @xmath25 lines were accompanied by a rich spectrum of narrow lines of low - ionization species ( he  i , o  i , mg  ii , si  ii , fe  ii ) .",
    "though conspicuous , the emission lines account for only @xmath30 of the total optical flux on days 31 and 57 .",
    "instead , a blue continuum dominates . estimating @xmath31 from the interstellar na  i  d absorption in our day 31 spectrum ( @xcite ) , we fit it with blackbody spectra with temperatures of @xmath32  k and @xmath33  k , respectively .",
    "the effective temperatures indicated by the blackbody fits are much higher than the @xmath34  k usually observed in sne iip at similar epochs .",
    "the decrease in temperature was accompanied by the disappearance of the @xmath35 lines and increasingly strong @xmath36 features .",
    "a spectrum taken by filippenko ( 1997 ) on day 80 shows that the spectral features had changed only marginally compared to our day 57 spectrum , but the slope of the continuum indicated a decrease in effective temperature to @xmath37  k.    the photometric fading at @xmath38110 days coincided with dramatic changes in the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath39 color , previously steady at @xmath40 , increased to 1.75 between days 85 and 111 ( fig .  1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the flux in @xmath41 dropped at roughly the same rate as the @xmath2 and @xmath4 light curves .",
    "this coincidence , together with the shift to lower - excitation lines during the plateau phase , suggests that the narrow lines were predominantly excited by the supernova continuum rather than by a circumstellar shock ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "the day 121 spectrum shows narrow ( @xmath42 ) emission in @xmath41 , @xmath43  d @xmath445893 and [ ca  ii ] @xmath457291 , 7324 , on top of a continuum - like spectrum .",
    "the flux of the narrow @xmath41 component had dropped by a factor @xmath46 since day 57 .",
    "no broad features can be identified , but the sharp edge present at @xmath47   is a common feature in late - time supernova spectra , usually attributed to the redmost extent of blended fe  ii or [ fe  ii ] lines .",
    "we suggest that the apparent continuum is in fact made up of overlapping broad emission lines , with a gap around 5650   .",
    "unlike other type ii events at this epoch , there is no sign of strong , broad @xmath41 .    on day 202 ,",
    "the spectrum was dominated by a fairly flat , noisy continuum and unresolved @xmath41 , which may contain a contribution from a background @xmath48 region .",
    "the flux in the narrow @xmath41 line had dropped by a factor of @xmath49 compared to the day 121 spectrum , but its width remained constant within the errors .",
    "the flux in the @xmath4 band of our spectrum on day 202 agrees well with our @xmath4 magnitude on day 197 .",
    "our photometric limit from day 646 ( @xmath50 ) demonstrates that the supernova continued to fade after day 202 , and gives a lower limit on the flux contribution of the supernova to the day 202 spectrum of @xmath51 .",
    "we suggest that the continuum at this epoch comes from background stars .",
    "we tentatively identify a broad , @xmath52 , emission feature at @xmath53    as [ ca  ii ]  @xmath457291 , 7324 , and suggest that the remaining emission left after the continuum is subtracted is , as on day 121 , composed of broad emission lines .",
    "the [ ca  ii ] feature has luminosity a factor of @xmath38100 lower than for sn 1987a at the same epoch ; the luminosity of @xmath41 is at least a factor of 2 lower still ( fig .",
    "in figure  5 we compare the absolute light curve of sn 1994w to those of other sne iip , sn 1987a and the luminous sn iil ( linear ) 1979c . at maximum ,",
    "sn 1994w was as luminous as sn 1983k , the most luminous sn iip previously observed ( phillips et al .",
    "evident from figure  5 is the rapid fading and low luminosity of sn 1994w after the plateau phase ends , i.e. , @xmath24  days , and the fast decline after that .",
    "we now investigate whether the unusual light curve and spectra of sn 1994w can be explained in terms of standard supernova theory .      for a sn iip , the mass of ejected @xmath3ni , @xmath54 ,",
    "can be estimated from the luminosity after the plateau phase ends . at this point",
    "the optical emission is powered by @xmath55ray energy deposited into the ejecta from the radioactive decay of @xmath3co , the decay product of @xmath3ni .",
    "the e - folding time for the cobalt decay is 111.26 days , so the radioactive decay creates a tail to the bolometric light curve with a slope of 0.00976 mag day@xmath56 , if all the @xmath55rays are trapped .",
    "the luminosity of the tail gives a measure of @xmath54 , when other contributions to the light curve have been accounted for .",
    "the mass of ejected nickel has been determined in this way for a handful of sne iip , for example sne 1969l ( @xmath57 , @xcite ) , 1990e ( @xmath58 , @xcite ) , 1992h ( @xmath59 , @xcite ) and sn 1991 g ( @xmath60 , @xcite ) .",
    "our method to estimate @xmath54 of sn 1994w is to compare the level of its luminosity in @xmath4 after the plateau to that of sn 1987a at similar epochs .",
    "we choose sn 1987a as a template since its distance and extinction are well known , and because its light curve was entirely powered by radioactive decay as soon as a few days after explosion .",
    "sn 1987a also resembled a sn iip in that it had a massive hydrogen envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "for sn 1987a the value of @xmath54 was @xmath61 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a problem with our method is that the light curve tail of sn 1994w declines substantially faster than the decay rate of @xmath3co",
    ". we must therefore be careful in spelling out the assumptions involved in interpreting the light curve .",
    "we identify two possible scenarios which can lead to such a decline , and which lead to different estimates of @xmath54 .",
    "radioactive decay of @xmath3co could dominate , but be unable for some reason to maintain the standard tail of the @xmath4 light curve .",
    "alternatively , some source other than @xmath3co decay dominates the light curve during this period . in the following sections we investigate both these possibilities and their implications for @xmath54 .",
    "first we consider the possibility that all of the flux on the tail was indeed due to cobalt decay .",
    "the steep decline could then be due to increasing escape of @xmath62-rays , a gradual shift of the spectrum from the optical to the infrared , or increasing dust obscuration .    assuming a central radioactive source , the optical depth to @xmath62-rays through the ejecta decreases with time as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the time when @xmath65 . in sn 1987a , @xmath66  days ( kozma 1996 ) .",
    "including the fact that @xmath1% of the cobalt decay energy is mediated by positrons and therefore deposited locally , the bolometric luminosity decays by the factor @xmath67 in addition to the decay of @xmath3co .",
    "the observed flux in @xmath4 between days 125 and 197 drops by a factor @xmath68 in addition to cobalt decay . with the assumptions above the maximum value of @xmath69 for the same period is only @xmath70 ( for @xmath71  days ) and thus can not reproduce the fast decline of the light curve .",
    "we therefore believe that @xmath62-ray leakage was not the cause of the exceptionally fast fading of sn 1994w after @xmath20  days .    a gradual shift of the spectrum into the infrared might be expected if the mass of @xmath3ni was substantially lower than in sn 1987a , and the reduced radioactive heating lowered the ejecta temperature . in this scenario",
    "our assumption of linear scaling between @xmath54 and the @xmath4-luminosity could break down . to test this numerically , we ran two models of sn 1987a kindly provided for us by c. kozma",
    ". these models do not include dust formation and are similar to her mixed 10h model in kozma ( 1996 ) , but with only @xmath72 @xmath73 , and with other radioactive isotopes decreased accordingly .",
    "we find that on day 150 , more than 60 ( 70)% of the line emission comes out between @xmath74   , @xmath75 and @xmath76 of which in h@xmath77 and [ ca  ii ] , respectively .",
    "therefore , if dust formation is unimportant , and the structure similar to that of sn 1987a , linear scaling of @xmath54 with @xmath4 and @xmath2 luminosities seems to be valid down to very low values of @xmath54 .",
    "the situation is different if dust formation is important .",
    "we expect that below some value of @xmath54 , radioactive heating of the ejecta will be unable to prevent the formation of dust .",
    "this could attenuate and shift the supernova emission into the infrared already shortly after the plateau phase .",
    "the effect could be further amplified by increased molecular cooling , since the destruction rate of molecules will decrease with lower @xmath54 .",
    "we know that dust increased the cooling and obscured the line - emitting region in sn 1987a ( kozma 1996 , and references therein ) , albeit at a later epoch ( between @xmath78  days ) than considered here for sn 1994w . the dust covering factor would have increased with time , creating a blueshift of the supernova lines , as observed for sn 1987a ( danziger et al .",
    "our day 202 spectrum is too noisy to reveal such an effect .",
    "thus , we can not rule out dust formation as the cause of the fast fading in @xmath4 .    to obtain an estimate of @xmath54 in the case of early dust formation",
    ", we choose the @xmath4 measurement from day 139 , which is the first photometric point on the light curve tail .",
    "this gives @xmath79 .",
    "the estimated error includes the statistical error shown in figure  1 , uncertainty in the distance modulus of sn 1994w ( @xmath800.3 mag ) , the extinction towards the supernova ( @xmath800.15 mag ) and an estimated systematic error of our @xmath4 calibration ( @xmath800.15 mag ) .",
    "this @xmath54 is slightly lower than for the previous record - holder , sn 1991 g , which had @xmath60 .",
    "however , sn 1991 g did not show the very steep decline of the light curve tail ( @xcite ) .",
    "this could mean that even sn 1991 g ejected too much @xmath3ni to allow early dust formation , though the structure of sn 1991 g could also have been less favorable for dust formation to occur than in sn 1994w .",
    "if the steep tail is not primarily powered by radioactive decay we need an additional , fast declining , energy source .",
    "a light echo seems rather improbable as it would produce a spectrum on the tail that is qualitatively similar to the spectrum at the peak .",
    "this is not observed .",
    "a more attractive power source is interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material at @xmath81 days . in  4.4 we present evidence from the narrow line profiles for a thin , dense circumstellar shell close to the supernova .",
    "the high density we find for the shell may be sufficient to set up the isothermal - shock - wave scenario discussed by grasberg & nadyozhin ( 1986 ) , in which the ejecta s kinetic energy is transformed to uv and optical emission . as the shell",
    "is accelerated , the conversion of kinetic energy becomes less efficient , which could create the steeply - falling light curve . in this case the photometric point on day 197 gives a firm upper limit to @xmath54 . assuming no dust , the @xmath62-rays to be trapped and a linear scaling between @xmath4-luminosity and @xmath54 this gives @xmath82 .",
    "this limit could of course be higher if dust is important also in this scenario . in summary , we suggest that the low luminosity on the light curve tail is due to a very low mass of ejected nickel",
    ".      we will now examine whether such a small mass of @xmath3ni can be consistent with the type of progenitor indicated by the light curve up to @xmath24 days .",
    "the very low nickel mass we find , if radioactivity is not the prime power source between days 120 and 197 ( @xmath82 ) , agrees with model calculations only for progenitors in the ranges @xmath7 ( @xcite ) and @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the steep decline of the light curve tail was due instead to early dust formation , our more conservative estimate ( @xmath79 ) is still lower than the range @xmath83 , predicted for progenitors in the range @xmath84 ( @xcite ) , but somewhat higher than @xmath54 predicted for stars with @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "theory thus favors two kinds of progenitor that eject low masses of @xmath3ni : a low mass progenitor , that produces almost no nickel during the explosion , or a very massive star where the mass - cut ( the location in mass coordinates between ejected matter and that eventually forming the compact , central object ) is situated sufficiently far out for most of the synthesized nickel to be trapped in the compact object . due to the extensive fall - back of material in the latter case",
    ", the mass of the compact object may become large enough to form a black hole ( @xcite ) . as a matter of fact , woosley & timmes ( 1996 ) suggested that the prime observational diagnostic of a supernova forming a black hole would be a bright supernova that plummeted to very low or zero luminosity right after the plateau .    to estimate the mass of the progenitor we use the early light curve ( i.e. , at @xmath85  days ) of the supernova . at this epoch",
    "the supernova is powered by the release of stored shock energy from the explosion .",
    "the physics of the plateau phase has been parameterized analytically ( popov 1993 ) and fitted to numerical simulations ( litvinova & nadyozhin 1985 ) in terms of the explosion energy , @xmath86 , the stellar radius , @xmath87 , and the mass of the hydrogen envelope at the time of explosion , @xmath88 .",
    "assuming a canonical value for @xmath86 in the range @xmath89 ergs , we use parameterized expressions to estimate @xmath87 and @xmath88 for given @xmath90 ( the epoch when the plateau ends ) and @xmath2 ( the absolute visual magnitude before turn - down ) . taking @xmath91 days and @xmath92 ,",
    "popov s expressions give @xmath93 and @xmath94  cm , while the numerical models of litvinova & nadyozhin give @xmath95 and @xmath96  cm .",
    "@xmath88 decreases with increasing @xmath87 for given @xmath2 and @xmath86 .",
    "we thus derive a value of @xmath88 which is similar to , or in the case of the numerical models , slightly higher than that of sn 1987a ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such high values of @xmath88 strongly favor the higher mass range ( @xmath8 ) for the progenitor of sn 1994w .",
    "to @xmath88 we need to add the mass of the helium- and metal - rich core at the time of explosion . for a progenitor with @xmath97 ,",
    "this is @xmath98 ( @xcite ) . to be consistent with our estimate of @xmath88 for a @xmath97 progenitor",
    ", we must therefore allow for @xmath99 of stellar winds if popov s expressions are used for the plateau , while the numerical models do not require presupernova mass loss .",
    "a low - mass ( @xmath7 ) progenitor is possible for sn 1994w , but only if the explosion energy was lower than the canonical @xmath89 ergs assumed above and the conversion of explosion energy to radiation was very efficient .",
    "model b of falk & arnett ( 1977 ) shows that a high ( @xmath100 ) efficiency is possible if the star is very extended ( @xmath101  cm ) . assuming an explosion energy as low as @xmath102  ergs",
    ", popov s model can give an envelope mass of only @xmath103 for a radius of @xmath104  cm , while the model of litvinova & nadyozhin gives @xmath105 for a radius of @xmath106  cm . both the analytical and numerical estimates are thus consistent with a low mass ( @xmath7 ) progenitor , if the progenitor is very extended and the explosion energy is low . because a @xmath7 supernova only ejects @xmath107 ( @xcite ) ,",
    "this type of explosion is consistent only with our lowest @xmath54 ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "if sn 1994w resulted from the explosion of an @xmath108 star , its compact object should be a neutron star .",
    "if its progenitor was instead in the higher range , the mass of the newly - created compact object could become large enough to form a black hole ( @xcite ) . for a @xmath109 progenitor",
    ", the mass - cut should be @xmath110 ( timmes , woosley & weaver 1996 ) .",
    "the maximum mass of a neutron star is rather uncertain , depending on the adopted equation of state . if it is as low as @xmath111 ( @xcite ) , such a massive progenitor for sn 1994w most likely formed a black hole .",
    "the narrow lines of sn 1994w are not typical for sne iip . in ",
    "3 we argued that the flux in the lines was too low to affect the light curve on the plateau , which is why we were able to apply the light curve analysis in  4.3 . here",
    "we discuss the origin of the narrow lines . as already suggested in  3 , the lines",
    "are naturally explained in terms of excitation by the hot supernova continuum .",
    "another possibility could be excitation caused by circumstellar interaction of the ejecta with a clumpy wind , as suggested for sn 1988z by chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) . however , we see no obvious reason why this excitation mechanism should result in an excitation of the lines that closely follows the fading of the supernova continuum as in sn 1994w .",
    "the narrow emission lines were present as early as day @xmath112 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath77 had a roughly constant p - cygni profile from then until at least day 57 , the epoch of our last spectrum on the plateau ( see fig .",
    "the emission part of the p - cygni profile has a rounded rather than flat - topped peak , which immediately indicates that the optical depth in the lines @xmath113",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the steep red side and relatively broad absorption trough observed in both @xmath25 and @xmath36 indicate that the lines were scattering - dominated , and originated in a rather thin shell ( @xmath114 ) located close to the photosphere ( see fransson 1984 ) .",
    "the optical thickness of the fe  ii lines allows us to put a limit on the density in the shell . assuming a gas temperature of @xmath115  k and fe  ii / h = fe / h = @xmath116 ( i.e. , the solar value of fe / h )",
    ", we use expressions from mihalas ( 1978 ) to obtain a hydrogen density @xmath117 . here , @xmath118 is the velocity of the shell in units of @xmath119 and @xmath120 the shell radius in units of @xmath121  cm .",
    "we know from the line profiles that @xmath122 , and that the shell radius must be close to that of the photosphere . from our blackbody fits ( see  3 ) we estimate that the photospheric radius on days 31 and 57 was @xmath123  cm and @xmath124  cm , respectively .",
    "this gives a limit on @xmath125 , quite consistent with the absence of forbidden lines in the spectrum during the plateau .",
    "the near - constancy of the shell s velocity up to day 57 and its proximity to the photosphere allow us to locate the starting radius of the shell , @xmath126 , assuming it is the same shell that emits the lines at all epochs . using @xmath127",
    ", we obtain @xmath128  cm from both the day 31 and day 57 data . because the radius of the photosphere is rather uncertain ( @xmath129 ) , so is @xmath126 .",
    "the shell appears to have been quite close to the supernova around the time of explosion .",
    "we identify two possible origins .",
    "one possibility is that the shell was created in the supernova envelope during the explosion .",
    "the formation of such a shell was suggested by falk & arnett ( 1977 ) , who actually also predicted that this should result in narrow p - cygni profiles .",
    "the problem with this interpretation is the low velocity of the shell . even in their low - explosion - energy ,",
    "extended model b , falk & arnett find a shell velocity roughly twice as high as we find for sn 1994w .",
    "it seems more plausible that the shell was circumstellar , perhaps due to an episode of increased mass loss some time @xmath130 prior to the explosion , where @xmath131 is the initial velocity of the shell .",
    "this scenario is similar to the model presented by grasberg & nadyozhin ( 1986 ) for sn 1983k .",
    "we find that the radiation from the supernova can easily accelerate the shell to the observed velocity .",
    "assuming pure electron scattering , a shell initially at rest is accelerated up to @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the integrated bolometric luminosity of the supernova in units of @xmath134  ergs and @xmath120 the shell radius in units of @xmath121  cm .",
    "the velocity can be substantially higher if line acceleration is important .",
    "we note that the blue edge of the h@xmath77 absorption shifted slightly to the blue between days 18 and 31 , corresponding to an increase in shell velocity from @xmath135 to @xmath136 ( fig .",
    "this is consistent with the supernova radiation continuing to accelerate the shell between these epochs .    in the model of grasberg & nadyozhin ( 1986 ) , the shell",
    "is eventually accelerated to the velocity of the supernova ejecta due to circumstellar interaction . however , in reality this may take longer than in grasberg & nadyozhin s 1-d models because the slow shell might break up ( @xcite ) .",
    "in sn 1994w , the disruption of the proposed shell by the ejecta could perhaps power the light curve between @xmath20 and 197 days , as we suggested in  4.2 .",
    "we have observed the luminous sn 1994w .",
    "we find that the low flux of the supernova after @xmath20 days is evidence of very low mass of @xmath3ni ejected at the explosion , in fact the lowest inferred for any sn ii .",
    "the estimated mass of @xmath3ni depends on the interpretation of the unusually rapid fading observed in @xmath4 between days 120 and 197 .",
    "either the supernova ejected @xmath6 of @xmath3ni , or the nickel mass could have been as low as @xmath5 .",
    "the first possibility requires inefficiency in converting radioactive decay energy to @xmath4 luminosity , and we find that early dust formation is the most likely cause for this .",
    "alternatively , the primary power source between @xmath137 days was not radioactive decay , but perhaps interaction with a thin circumstellar shell .",
    "in this case @xmath138 is an upper limit , if dust formation was unimportant .",
    "two types of progenitor seem consistent with the low nickel content and high luminosity of the supernova before the end of its plateau phase .",
    "the first possibility is a low mass progenitor with @xmath139 , which had a very extended envelope and a low explosion energy , @xmath140  ergs . as a low mass progenitor only produces @xmath141 @xmath3ni ( @xcite ) , consistent only with our lowest value for @xmath54 , an additional power source , presumably circumstellar interaction ,",
    "is needed to explain the light curve between @xmath137 days for this type of progenitor .",
    "however , the energy budget seems uncomfortably tight for the low - mass case as sn 1994w was one of the most luminous supernovae observed .",
    "a more natural possibility is therefore a high mass progenitor with @xmath8 , which could have lost a few solar masses as stellar winds , and exploded with the canonical energy @xmath89 ergs .",
    "this type of progenitor is consistent with both our estimates of @xmath54 .",
    "such a supernova should have a mass - cut @xmath110 , sufficient to trap most of the produced @xmath3ni , and could have formed a black hole .",
