    ".    unfortunately , even with the aid of massively parallel next - generation computers , cfd simulations for applications such as these are still too expensive for real - time and multi - query applications such as uncertainty quantification ( uq ) , optimization and control design .",
    "reduced order modeling is a promising tool for bridging the gap between high - fidelity , and real - time simulations / uq .",
    "reduced order models ( roms ) are derived from a sequence of high - fidelity simulations but have a much lower computational cost .",
    "hence , roms can enable real - time simulations of complex systems for more rapid analysis , control and decision - making in the presence of uncertainty .",
    "most existing rom approaches are based on projection . in projection - based reduced order modeling ,",
    "the state variables are approximated in a low - dimensional subspace .",
    "there exist a number of approaches for calculating this low - dimensional subspace , e.g. , proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod )  @xcite , dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd )  @xcite balanced pod ( bpod )  @xcite , balanced truncation  @xcite , and the reduced basis method @xcite . in all of these methods ,",
    "a basis for the low - dimensional subspace is obtained from a basis for a higher - dimensional subspace through truncation  the removal of modes that are believed to be unimportant in representing a problem solution .",
    "typically , the size of the reduced basis is chosen according to an energy criterion : modes with low energy are discarded , so that the reduced basis subspace is spanned by the highest energy modes . although truncated modes are negligible from a data compression point of view , they are often crucial for representing solutions to the dynamical flow equations .",
    "dynamics of the truncated orthogonal subspace must be taken into account for to ensure stability and accuracy of the rom .    for linear systems , a variety of techniques for generating low - dimensional",
    "projection- based roms with rigorous stability guarantees and accuracy bounds are available  @xcite .",
    "equivalent results are lacking for nonlinear systems .",
    "traditionally , low - dimensional roms of fluid flows have been stabilized and enhanced using empirical turbulence models . in this approach",
    ", the nonlinear dynamics of the truncated subspace are modeled using additional constant and linear terms in the rom system of ordinary differential equations ( odes )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , nonlinear eddy - viscosity models have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "one downside of turbulence models is that they destroy consistency between the navier - stokes partial differential equations ( pdes ) and the ode system of the rom .",
    "accurately identifying and matching free coefficients of the turbulence models is another challenge .",
    "moreover , these methods are usually limited to the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "consider , for concreteness , the pod / galerkin approach to model reduction applied to the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "for these equations , the natural choice of inner product for the galerkin projection step of the model reduction procedure is the @xmath0 inner product .",
    "this is because , in these models , the solution vector is taken to be the velocity vector @xmath1 , so that @xmath2 is a measure of the global kinetic energy in the domain , and the pod modes optimally represent the kinetic energy present in the ensemble from which they were generated .",
    "the same is not true for the compressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "hence , if a compressible fluid rom is constructed in the @xmath0 inner product ( a common choice of inner product in projection - based model reduction ) , the rom solution may not satisfy the conservation relation implied by the governing equations , and may exhibit non - physical instabilities  @xcite .    unfortunately , rom instability is a real problem for many compressible flow problems : as demonstrated in  @xcite , a compressible fluid pod / galerkin rom might be stable for a given number of modes , but unstable for other choices of basis size .",
    "several researchers have proposed ways to circumvent this difficulty through the careful construction of an energy - based inner product for the projection step of the model reduction .",
    "@xcite show that galerkin projection preserves the stability of an equilibrium point at the origin if the rom is constructed in an energy  based inner product .",

    "@xcite propose applying the stabilizing projection developed by  @xcite to a skew - symmetric system constructed by augmenting a given linear system with its adjoint system .",
    "the downside to these methods is that they are inherently embedded methods : access to the governing pdes and/or the code that discretizes these pdes is required .",
    "other rom approaches , e.g. , the gauss - newton with approximated tensors ( gnat ) method of  @xcite , have better stability properties , as they formulate the rom at the fully discrete level .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that an additional layer of approximation  usually called hyper - reduction  is required to gain computational speed - up .",
    "moreover , the approach lacks stability guarantees for low - dimensional expansions .    in this paper , a stabilization and enhancement approach to roms for the compressible navier - stokes equations is developed .",

    "the specific volume ( @xmath3 ) form of the compressible navier - stokes equations is utilized .",
    "since these equations have polynomial ( quadratic ) nonlinearities , the galerkin projection can be computed offline , once and for all ; no hyper - reduction is required  @xcite . unlike traditional eddy - viscosity - based stabilization methods",
    ", the proposed approach requires no additional empirical turbulence modeling terms ",
    "truncated modes are accounted for _ a priori _ via a minimal rotation of projection subspace .",
    "the method is also non - intrusive , as it operates only on the matrices and tensors defining a rom ode system , which are stabilized through the offline solution of a small trace minimization problem on the stiefel manifold .",
    "the proposed new approach can be interpreted as a combination of several previously developed ideas . following  @xcite",
    ", we propose to stabilize and enhance projection - based roms by modifying the projection subspace in order to capture more of the low - energy , but high dissipative scales of the flow solution . similarly to  @xcite , a rotation of the projection subspace is used to achieve this goal .",
    "specifically , a larger set of basis is linearly superimposed to provide a smaller set of basis that generate a stable and accurate rom .",
    "finally , in the spirit of most previously proposed eddy - viscosity - based turbulence models , the eigenvalues of the linear part of the galerkin system of odes are used as a proxy to guide the stabilization algorithm .",
