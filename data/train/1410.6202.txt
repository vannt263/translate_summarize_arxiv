    "taking properly into account the effect of gravity can be quite non - trivial .",
    "although in some cases the effect of gravity is secondary , there are in fact several cases in which gravity plays a crucial role , such as the upward quantum tunnelling from a lower to a higher energy vacuum  @xcite .",
    "even when the effect of gravity is secondary , including gravity can make the treatment highly non - trivial .",
    "one example is the subtle issue raised by lavrelashvili , rubakov and tinyakov  @xcite that fluctuations around bubble nucleation might cause an instability , which leads to explosive particle production .",
    "one prescription to cure this pathology was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it is shown that one can eliminate the instability , at least apparently , by an appropriate choice of the gauge .",
    "quantum tunnelling in connection with gravity has been discussed also in other contexts .",
    "one of them is wormhole formation  @xcite , which is the main subject of this paper .",
    "wormhole formation is a signature of what in the literature is also referred to as baby / child universe creation  @xcite .",
    "spherical thin shells with various equations of state have been studied , as models of matter fields able to describe this process . even in the simple case of a pure tension shell",
    ", the quantum mechanical formation of a wormhole seems possible .",
    "however , some inconsistencies between different prescriptions seem to exist in literature  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will clarify that the origin of these apparent discrepancies is tightly related to the use of the time coordinate in the static chart .",
    "we then propose a plausible prescription based on a smooth time - slicing to tackle the problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conventional ] we briefly review the derivation of the standard result for the tunnelling amplitude based on the direct evaluation of the action , when the time slice of the static chart is used . in sec .  [ sec : wormhole ] we discuss the problem that arises when we try to apply the conventional formula to situations characterized by wormhole production .",
    "to overcome some difficulties that appear in this last case , in sec .",
    "[ sec : casts ] we then study the same problem using a canonical approach with smooth time slice : this allows us to derive the formula for the tunnelling rate without any ambiguity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cde ] we finally show how the same formula can be reproduced by the direct evaluation of the action if we carefully take the smooth time slice . sec .",
    "[ sec : sumcon ] is devoted to summary and discussion : we also elaborate on a remaining , more subtle , issue .",
    "in this paper we consider the simplest spherically symmetric domain wall model , whose lagrangian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scalar curvature and @xmath2 is the radius dependent mass of the wall , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath3constant for a dust domain wall while @xmath4 for a wall consisting of pure tension @xmath5 ; moreover @xmath6 is the proper time along the wall , while @xmath7 denotes the circumferential radius of the wall . in general , quantities marked with a `` @xmath8 '' are considered to be evaluated at the position of the wall , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath9 when @xmath10 is a function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is one possible parametrization of the wall trajectory .",
    "depending on the model parameters , the wall motion can have some classically forbidden region for a range of the radius .",
    "we are interested in discussing the quantum tunnelling of the wall when it reaches a turning point , _ i.e. _ a boundary of the classically forbidden region , by explicitly taking into account gravity .    in this section",
    "we derive a conventional but incorrect formula for the tunnelling rate of the wall .",
    "although we mostly follow ref .",
    "@xcite , we are _ not _ claiming that the result obtained in this reference is wrong .",
    "indeed , our emphasis is about the fact that in this reference the authors clearly identified a discrepancy between the direct evaluation of the action that they propose and a naive canonical approach .",
    "moreover , it was clearly emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite that the proposed direct approach guarantees , instead , a continuous variation of the action as the parameters ( the schwarzschild mass , the schwarzschild sitter cosmological constant , the wall surface tension , in their model ) are changed : on the contrary , the conventional canonical approach does not guarantee continuity of the action as a function of the parameters . at the same time the direct calculation of the action",
    "discloses the difficulties in the identification of the euclidean manifold interpolating between the before- and after - tunnelling classical solutions in a consistent way : indeed , farhi et al .",
    "associate what they call a _ pseudo - manifold _ to the instanton solution .",
    "the direct approach defines the pseudo - manifold by weighting different volumes of the instanton along the classically forbidden trajectory by an integer number that counts how many times ( and in which direction ) the euclidean volume is swept by the time slice .",
    "we will later show that the canonical approach , in full generality , can reproduce the same value for the tunnelling action given in the approach proposed by farhi et al ..    the direct evaluation of the action is possible because the solution is simply given by a junction of two spacetimes . here , for simplicity , we assume that the inside and outside of the bubble are both empty , so that the inside can be taken as a piece of minkowski spacetime and the outside as a piece of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "( in ref .",
    "@xcite the inside was equipped with vacuum energy density , _",
    "i.e. _ , a cosmological constant , but this does not change the treatment in any substantial way . )",
    "the method proposed by farhi et al . was developed in coordinates adapted to the static and spherically symmetric nature of the spacetimes participating in the junction . with this , we mean that the lagrangian was preferably considered in connection with the coordinate times in the static chart in both spacetime regions , which we denote by @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the simplified case that we are considering here .",
    "however , most of the calculations were performed using the proper time of an observer sitting on the junction , and therefore the result can be easily extended to a coordinate - independent expression , as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : cde ] .",
    "the contributions to the action can be summarized as follows .    1 .   a matter term coming from the shell , @xmath16 : this is nothing but the contribution from the stress - energy tensor localized on the bubble surface .",
    "2 .   a gravity term coming from the bubble wall , @xmath17 : this is , basically , the well - known _ extrinsic - curvature - trace - jump _ term .",
    "the bulk contributions vanish for classical solutions since there is no matter in the bulk .",
    "surface terms : although the appearance of surface terms is conceptually clear , the treatment of these terms may be non - trivial . as clearly discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite several contributions arise",
    ". 1 .   in their treatment ,",
    "a crucial contribution , @xmath18 , comes from the bubble wall positions , where the normal to the constant time surface is discontinuous .",
    "however , this contribution does not appear if we adopt a smooth foliation of time across the wall . in sec .",
    "[ sec : casts ] we take this latter picture .",
    "2 .   another contribution comes from a surface at a large constant circumferential radius in the outside spacetime , @xmath19 : this cut - off radius allows us to work with a ( spatially ) bounded volume , and the large radius limit has to be taken in the end .",
    "this limit naturally brings in divergences , which can be usually dealt with , _",

    "( [ gravityterm ] ) as @xmath153 we have then subtracted @xmath154 from the total action . in the computation of sec .",
    "[ sec : conventional ] half of this subtraction was compensated by @xmath19 and the rest by the above contribution  ( [ lastterm ] ) .",
    "however , we find @xmath155 when we use a smooth foliation for the tunnelling solution with wormhole formation .",
    "this shows that an additional contribution @xmath156 to the euclidean action arises .",
    "gathering all , we find that the euclidean action evaluated by using a smooth foliation is given by @xmath157     +      { \\hat r\\over 2 } \\hat{\\bar\\phi}\\bigr\\vert_{\\bar{t_{\\mathrm s}^{\\mathrm i}}}^{\\bar{t_{\\mathrm s}^{\\mathrm f } } }      + { { r_{\\mathrm{g}}}^2\\over 2}\\right )   \\cr & = & { 1\\over g } \\left (      - \\int \\ !",
    "dt\\ , \\dot{\\hat r}\\ , [ \\bar\\psi ]     + { { r_{\\mathrm{g}}}^2-\\hat r(\\bar\\tau^{\\mathrm f})\\over 2}\\right)~ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is precisely identical to @xmath158 .",
    "in this work we studied the wormhole production for the simplest spherically symmetric shell model in asymptotically flat spacetime . in this simple setup , the instanton solution can be generically described by the junction of euclideanized minkowski and schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "this solution , however , is not a riemannian manifold in the sense that the existence of the domain wall may depend on the path taken to reach the possible location of the wall in spacetime .",
    "the term _ pseudo - manifold _ was used in  @xcite to denote this solution . a key point that we have emphasized here , is that in this case the ordinary constant - time surfaces associated with the static chart do not foliate the instanton smoothly . as a result ,",
    "methods based on this time slicing inevitably become conceptually ambiguous .",
    "we have here discussed , however , that even in these cases , if we choose a smooth time slicing to connect the configurations before and after the tunnelling , it is still possible to find the wkb wave function along an interpolating path of configurations with a bubble wall . in this way",
    ", we can identify an appropriate expression for the tunnelling rate without any ambiguity .",
    "the result agrees with the direct evaluation of the euclidean action once we properly subtract the zero - point energy and count how many times each region in the instanton solution is swept when we consider a smooth foliation .",
    "it is possible to trace the subtle nature of the _ pseudo - manifold _ to the fact that the time lapse in the euclidean region is not positive everywhere . indeed",
    ", the sign of the time lapse has to be opposite between the center and the asymptotic infinity , for at least some range during the time evolution .",
    "this is a feature that is common to the upward tunnelling in the case of bubble nucleation .",
    "it would be worth investigating whether or not this negative lapse causes any problem when we take into account fluctuations around the wkb trajectory .",
