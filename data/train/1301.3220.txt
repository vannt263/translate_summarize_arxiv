    "codes @xcite are an important class of linear error - correcting codes in both coding theory and their applications .",
    "these codes can asymptotically approach the varshamov - gilbert bound @xcite .",
    "moreover , their partial cyclic structure simplifies their encoding and decoding implementations by using simple shift registers and logic circuits @xcite . in recent years , research on qc codes has focused on one of their subclasses , known as qc low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes @xcite-@xcite , which have been shown to perform as well as other types of ldpc codes in most applications .",
    "qc - ldpc codes have advantages over other types of ldpc codes in hardware implementation of encoding @xcite and decoding @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , most ldpc codes adopted as standard codes for various next - generation communication and storage systems are qc .",
    "one important development of qc codes is the introduction of matrix transformation via the _ galois fourier transform _ @xcite . in the fourier",
    "transform domain , an array of circulants is specified by a diagonal matrix over a finite field .",
    "it has been shown to be amenable to analysis and construction of some qc - ldpc codes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the authors of @xcite expanded the analyses of ranks and row - redundancies into most qc - ldpc codes .",
    "qc codes generally are encoded by multiplying a message vector @xmath8 of length @xmath1 with an @xmath9 generator matrix @xmath10 , where @xmath10 usually is systematic @xcite with @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 being the identity matrix @xmath13 in the rest of the paper , @xmath10 is systematic if not stated otherwise .",
    "there are two issues with the implementation of qc code systems .",
    "first , the generator matrix @xmath10 is usually not sparse , so it requires a large number , i.e. , @xmath14 , of memory units to store @xmath15 .",
    "second , although encoding of qc codes can be partially parallelized so that the computation units are reduced by a factor of @xmath16 , the total number of symbol operations is still @xmath17 , which is the same as that for general linear codes .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to encode qc codes in the fourier domain rather than using direct multiplications in the symbol domain .",
    "we are motivated by the fact that the row space of the transformed generator matrix is the null space of the transformed parity - check matrix . moreover",
    ", the @xmath9 transformed generator matrix is an @xmath18 diagonal array of @xmath19 matrices .",
    "consequently , _ encoding in the transform domain ( etd ) _ is achieved by @xmath16 times encoding of message vectors of length @xmath20 with @xmath21 generator matrices ( rather than encoding of an @xmath1 message vector with an @xmath9 generator matrix ) .",
    "we call the resulting vector after etd the _ transformed codeword_. the final transmitted qc codeword is obtained by permutations and @xmath22 times inverse galois fourier transforms from the transformed codeword .",
    "thus , the computational complexity of etd is @xmath3 , which is much lower than that of traditional encoding .",
    "the memory consumption of etd is @xmath3 symbols , which is the same as that of traditional encoding .",
    "for example , we show that the computational complexity of etd of a 64-ary ( 4095,2160 ) qc code is only @xmath5 of that of traditional encoding .    since binary qc codes are used in many applications , we carry out a detailed study of etd of binary qc codes . for any binary qc code",
    ", its transformed generator matrix satisfies the conjugacy constraint @xcite , but the transmitted codeword from etd usually is not binary .",
    "thus , it costs several bits to transmit a code symbol , resulting in lower code rate . to make the transmitted codeword binary , we devise a simple and fast mapping to post - process the transformed codeword so that the new transformed codeword still satisfies the conjugacy constraint .",
    "the post - processing step consisting of a mapping with bases of subfields is the key in the binary case .",
    "the other steps of etd of binary qc codes are the same as those for the non - binary case .",
    "furthermore , if we take advantages of the conjugacy constraint on the transformed generator matrix , the computational complexity of etd can be reduced to @xmath4 .",
    "its memory consumption is @xmath3 , the same as in traditional one .",
    "we show that the computation complexities of etd of the binary ( 4095 , 2160 ) and ( 8176 , 7154 ) qc codes are respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 of those of traditional encoding .",
    "etd readily applies to qc - ldpc codes with full - rank parity - check matrices . however , there are many qc - ldpc codes , especially algebraic ldpc codes @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , whose parity - check matrices are abundant in redundant rows , i.e. , rank deficient . by carefully constructing the transformed generator matrix according to the rank of the diagonal matrices on the transformed parity - check matrix ,",
    "we show that our proposed etd algorithm works for such qc - ldpc ( or qc ) codes as well .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces qc codes and the matrix transformation . in section iii ,",
    "we present encoding of qc codes in the transform domain and study its computational complexity and memory consumption .",
    "section iv focuses on etd of binary qc codes and its simplification due to the conjugacy constraint .",
    "the key step in the binary case that involves construction of a post - processing mapping using subfield bases is derived .",

    "thus , @xmath175 symbols or bits are multiplied by @xmath97 in the first step in the non - binary or binary case .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a low - complexity encoding algorithm for qc codes in the transform domain .",
