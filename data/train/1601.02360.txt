    "the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) approach was proposed independently by glazek and wilson and wegner  @xcite and was initially applied in solid - state physics to simplify many - particle randomly disordered systems . since the solution of a many - particle problem requires diagonalization of the hamiltonian , a transformation which makes it more diagonal would be of great applicability , specially if the eigenvalues are preserved .",
    "this idea was then applied by wegner in order to suppress the off - diagonal matrix - elements of the hamiltonian by means of unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "the unitarity of the transformations ensures isospectrality and the generator of the transformations can be chosen to be diagonal if one wants to drive the original hamiltonian towards a band - diagonal form and to suppress its off - diagonal matrix - elements . as a by - product one gets a framework where these off - diagonal components may be better handled in perturbation theory .",
    "the application of the srg approach to nuclear physics was proposed by bogner , furnstahl and perry  @xcite with these simplifications in mind and will be our concern here ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first applications of the srg method considered high - precision  @xcite and chiral effective field theory ( cheft )  @xcite nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interactions as the input for the two - body flow equations . despite different degrees of freedom and types of interaction , the nuclear many - body problem has the same difficulty as the many - electron problem in solid - state physics .",
    "more diagonal hamiltonians result in great simplification and faster convergence in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "this feature gave rise to a whole program of application of the srg methods in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the formalism was then extended to three - body forces in several schemes @xcite .",
    "yet in the two - nucleon system , the interplay between the srg and a subtractive renormalization approach @xcite was investigated using the cheft @xmath6 interaction at leading - order @xcite .",
    "also , the role of long - distance symmetries in effective interactions obtained via srg flow equations have been recently investigated by us , showing that there is a particular srg scale at which the @xmath7 spin - isospin wigner symmetry is realized almost exactly @xcite .",
    "this is a remarkable result which shows that despite the increasing popularity of the srg ideas , techniques and extensive computational applications there is still much to be learned from dedicated analysis .",
    "the present paper provides further insights along these lines .",
    "the aim of this work is to explore the details underlying our recent results scanning all values of the srg cutoff and to extend them . in our previous letter",
    "@xcite a connection between the infrared limit of the srg evolution with the wegner generator and levinson s theorem @xcite was established .",
    "consequences of the infrared interactions for few - nucleon systems and the nuclear many - body problem were discussed in ref .",

    "this is a well known existing linear correlation between the binding energies of the triton and the @xmath8-particle which should be expected on the basis of scale invariance  @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for a review and references therein ) .",
    "further consequences regarding unitary neutron matter in the on - shell limit with a calculation of the bertsch parameter were addressed in @xcite and an srg discussion of the bcs pairing gap has also been undertaken in ref .  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the fixed points of the srg evolution in detail using a simple toy model for the nuclear force in the two - nucleon @xmath5-waves as a particular illustration which simplifies the computational effort considerably and allows for detailed numerical studies in the infrared limit .",
    "however , in the infrared region we will suggest that many features are fairly general and model independent . here",
    "we focus on the wilson and the wegner srg generators , since the evolution with a block - diagonal generator @xcite in the infrared region has already been studied in previous works @xcite , where the explicit renormalization of a simple @xmath6 force and the implicit renormalization of a pionless effective field theory ( eft ) at next - to - leading order were shown to be equivalent over a wide range of the renormalization scale .",
    "the srg equations are mostly solved numerically on a finite momentum grid with sufficiently many points as to approach the continuum and therefore the grid is viewed as an auxiliary means . here",
    ", we will analyze many effects which can only be clearly disentangled with the aid of this momentum grid , which by itself has some implications on its own and provides both an infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs featuring two basic properties of finite nuclei , namely , the long wavelength character of weak binding systems as well as the finite size of atomic nuclei .",
    "kukulin and collaborators in a series of recent and remarkable works have profited from these finite grids in the few - body problem including both bound and scattering states by analyzing hamiltonian eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that a judicious combination of srg and this approach may provide useful insights into the nuclear few - body problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : operator ]",
    "we present the srg flow equations in operator form and introduce some useful functional notation both in the continuum limit and in the discretized form which allows for a discussion of fixed points and their stability . in section  [ sec : toy ]",
    "we review the toy model which provides a quite reasonable description of the @xmath6 system in the @xmath5-wave channels at low - momenta and will be used in practice to carry out our infrared analysis . in section  [ sec : srg - grid ] we deal specifically with the srg flow equations on a finite momentum grid .",
    "the scattering problem as a lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation on the finite momentum grid is analyzed in section  [ sec : scatt - grid ] .",
    "there we provide a motivation to define the phase - shift as an energy - shift which , unlike the conventional phase - shifts determined from the solution of the ls equation , is invariant under unitary transformations on the grid .",
    "we illustrate the usefulness of the analysis by re - deriving a set of generalized trace identities , first unveiled by graham , jaffe , quandt and weigel in ref .",
    "@xcite , but starting from a momentum grid .",
    "our numerical results on these issues are presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] . there",
    "we focus on the crucial issue of the ordering of states along the srg evolution trajectory and the remarkable connection to levinson s theorem through an energy - shift formula .",
    "our interpretation corrects the erroneous implementation of kukulin and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "some of the consequences of the correct identification and ordering of states for the nuclear binding energies when approaching the infrared limit in the @xmath2 systems are discussed in section  [ sec : nucl ] . there",
    "the srg cutoff parameters triggers the avoided crossing pattern , familiar from molecular physics , underlying the tjon - line correlation .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we present a summary of the results and our main conclusions .",
    "the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) approach , developed by glazek and wilson  @xcite and independently by wegner  @xcite , has been intensively applied in the context of nuclear physics to handle multi - nucleon forces in order to soften the short - distance core  @xcite with a rather universal pattern for nuclear symmetries  @xcite and interactions  @xcite . the basic strategy underlying the application of the srg methods to nuclear forces is to evolve an initial ( bare ) interaction @xmath9 , which has been fitted to @xmath6 scattering data , via a continuous unitary transformation that runs a cutoff @xmath10 on energy differences .",
    "such a transformation generates a family of unitarily equivalent smooth interactions @xmath11 with a band - diagonal structure of a prescribed width roughly given by the srg cutoff @xmath10 .",
    "we employ the formulation for the srg developed by wegner  @xcite , which is based on a non - perturbative flow equation that governs the unitary evolution of the hamiltonian with a flow parameter @xmath12 that ranges from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the initial hamiltonian in the center - of - mass system ( cm ) and @xmath17 is the unitary transformation .",
    "the flow parameter @xmath12 has dimensions of @xmath18^{-2}$ ] and in terms of the srg cutoff @xmath10 with dimension of momentum is given by the relation @xmath19 .",
    "as usual , we split the hamiltonian as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the kinetic energy , which we assume to be independent of @xmath12 , and @xmath22 is the evolved potential . for a translational invariant system , i.e. @xmath23 , we can separate the cm and consider only the srg evolution of the hamiltonian for the relative motion , @xmath24 , since the cm kinetic energy @xmath25 does not contribute  @xcite . for simplicity , in what follows we will drop the superscript @xmath26 .",
    "the srg flow equation in operator form can then be written as @xmath27\\ ; , \\label{wegfloweq}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 and is to be solved with the boundary condition @xmath29 .",
    "the anti - hermitian operator @xmath30 which specifies the unitary transformation @xmath17 is usually taken as @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is a hermitian operator which we will call the srg generator since it defines @xmath30 and so the flow of the hamiltonian .",
    "the most popular choices for the generator are the relative kinetic energy @xmath33 ( wilson generator )  @xcite , the evolving diagonal part of the hamiltonian @xmath34 ( wegner generator )  @xcite and the so called block - diagonal generator @xmath35 , where the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 are orthogonal projectors ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) for states below and above a given momentum scale @xmath41  @xcite   approach  @xcite .",
    "novel generators have been proposed in @xcite . ] .",
    "so far the srg equations are quite general and can be used to evolve any hamiltonian . in",
    "what follows we will restrict to the case of @xmath6 interactions in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system .",
    "after decomposition of the @xmath6 interaction in partial waves the structure of the srg flow equations simplifies considerably in the off - diagonal relative momentum - space basis ( see e.g.  @xcite for an explicit derivation and details ) for which the following normalization in the completeness relation will be assumed ( here and in what follows we use units such that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the nucleon mass ) : @xmath44 inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ wegfloweq ] ) with the wilson generator , @xmath33 , the flow equation for the srg evolution of the @xmath6 potential is given by ( we drop the partial - wave quantum numbers for simplicity ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",

    "as we see , these are integro - differential equations which can not generally be solved analytically ( see however  @xcite ) and require a massive computational effort to be solved numerically .",
    "we will tackle this problem below by the traditional discretization method of the continuum  .",
    "most compact features of the srg formalism can be best appreciated within an operator space setup .",
    "we start with some remarks from the operator theory for finite - dimensional operators in order to introduce some notation ( see e.g. the standard textbook  @xcite ) . for operators acting on a hilbert space endowed with a scalar product of states @xmath50 and @xmath51 such as @xmath52",
    ", we can also define a further scalar product between operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 , namely @xmath55 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from here we define the frobenius norm as usual @xmath56=||a - b||   \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the norm can also be defined as @xmath57 has been introduced .",
    "of course , this requires finite norm operators @xmath58 which is unfortunately not the case for the usual unbounded operators in quantum mechanics , such as the kinetic energy .",
    "therefore an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath59 is generally assumed to operate here . using the partial - wave relative momentum - space normalization metric given in eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) we have @xmath60 thus , the kinetic energy would have infinite norm , @xmath61 if everything is taken literally .",
    "however , note that the continuum srg flow equations do not need the kinetic energy to be bound , but rather the potential energy .",
    "so , the implicit assumption is that at very high energies the kinetic energy dominates over the potential energy and hence srg flow equations are well defined provided the value of the potential does not boundlessly grow .",
    "the first problems we encounter with all these properties are :",
    "i ) the fact that the momentum - space basis spans a continuum set and ii ) the operators are unbounded .",
    "this difficulty is circumvented in practice by using a finite grid in momentum - space and also introducing a high - momentum cutoff @xmath62 which will be assumed below .      in this section",
    "we briefly review the concepts of isospectral flow and fixed points incorporated in the srg evolution and the variational interpretation in operator space .",
    "the isospectrality of the srg flow equation becomes evident from the trace invariance property of the evolved hamiltonian @xmath63 . for any choice of the srg generator @xmath32 we have a unitary transformation and hence @xmath64 for any integer @xmath65",
    "this property follows directly from the commutator structure of the srg flow equation plus the regulator assumption one has @xmath66 which for a local potential @xmath67 diverges as the momentum cutoff .",
    "also , the trace of a commutator @xmath68 $ ] only vanishes when both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are finite , as the choice @xmath71 and @xmath72 clearly illustrates , since @xmath73= - i\\hbar$ ] and hence @xmath74= - i \\hbar ~{\\rm",

    "( [ eq : srgflow ] ) , @xmath76,h_s ] = 0 \\ ; . \\label{eq : fixed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this condition implies that there is a basis in which both @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath63 become simultaneously diagonal at a fixed point .",
    "the question is what choices of the generator @xmath32 actually drive the hamiltonian @xmath63 to the diagonal form .",
    "for generators @xmath32 which satisfy @xmath78 and using the cyclic properties of the trace and the invariance of @xmath79 , we get that @xmath80 ^ 2=-2~{\\rm tr}\\left[\\left(i~[g_s , h_s]\\right)^\\dagger \\left(i~[g_s , h_s]\\right)\\right]\\le 0   \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath81 = a^\\dagger$ ] is a self - adjoint operator and therefore @xmath82 is a semi - definite positive operator .",
    "since @xmath83 is positive but its derivative is negative , the limit @xmath84 exists and corresponds to the infrared fixed point of the srg evolution ( @xmath1 ) , at which the hamiltonian @xmath63 becomes diagonal .",
    "thus , the srg flow equation just provides a continuous procedure to diagonalize the initial hamiltonian @xmath85 .",
    "in the case of the srg evolution with the wegner generator , @xmath47 , the flow equation is given by @xmath97,h_s ] \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , in this case we get for @xmath98 that @xmath99 ^ 2=-2~{\\rm tr}~\\left[\\left(i~[h^{d}_s , h_s]\\right)^\\dagger \\left(i~[h^{d}_s , h_s]\\right)\\right ] \\le 0   \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath100 and so @xmath101 which just shows that the wegner generator minimizes the distance to its diagonal matrix - elements keeping the eigenvalues of the original hamiltonian .",
    "of course , if the hamiltonian becomes diagonal the eigenvectors can not be free momentum eigenstates .",
    "finally , for the block - diagonal generator we define two orthogonal projection operators @xmath102 which split the states below or above a given momentum scale @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the flow equation is given by @xmath103,h_s ]   \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then get that the evolution makes the asymptotic hamiltonian block - diagonal hence minimizing the off - diagonal matrix - elements , @xmath104      only in few cases the srg operator equations can be handled in the continuum  @xcite . in this section",
    "we analyze the details of the implementation of the srg when a finite dimensional reduction of the model space is imposed",
    ". the particular case of a momentum grid discretization of the continuum will be discussed specifically in a later section . for simplicity",
    "we will consider a basis of eigenstates @xmath105 of the kinetic energy operator @xmath95 on a finite @xmath106-dimensional hilbert space @xmath107 , namely @xmath108 , and assume that the corresponding spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath109 is non - degenerate ( similar to what happens in the partial - wave relative momentum - space basis for which @xmath110 ) .",
    "thus , the matrix - elements of the hamiltonian @xmath111 in this basis read @xmath112 .",
    "the discrete srg flow equations for the matrix - elements of the hamiltonian in the case of the wilson generator can be written in the form @xmath113 h_{nm}(s ) + \\sum_{k \\neq n , m } ( \\epsilon_n+\\epsilon_m-2 \\epsilon_k )",

    "the srg evolution with both the wilson and the wegner generators on a finite @xmath106-dimensional discrete space have infrared fixed points at which the hamiltonian becomes diagonal .",
    "thus , we have two interpolating srg trajectories between the initial bare hamiltonian , @xmath129 , and the final one , @xmath130 . from this point of view , there seems to be no conceptual difference between the srg evolution with both generators , since the isospectrality of the srg flow equation guarantees the invariance of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath131 .",
    "this naive argument overlooks an important detail : the fact that through the srg evolution the basis of eigenstates @xmath132 of the hamiltonian @xmath63 is actually changing , i.e. @xmath133 and thus the isospectrality does not necessarily fix the final ordering of the eigenvalues which is obtained in the infrared limit @xmath134 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is not a peculiar feature of the srg evolution ; it is shared by _ any _ diagonalization procedure . in the gauss elimination method",

    "the srg evolution induces a very specific ordering of the eigenstates .",

    "of course , the uniqueness of the solution further implies that the infrared fixed point to which the srg evolved hamiltonian is steadily driven must be asymptotically stable .",
    "in this section we will carry out a perturbative stability analysis of the infrared fixed points for both the wilson and the wegner generators , which is based on a linearization of the srg flow equations similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite , as an attempt to determine _ a priory _ the final ordering of the spectrum induced by the srg evolution in the infrared limit .",
    "as we will see , the perturbative analysis is well - succeeded in predicting the ordering of the spectrum only in the case of the wilson generator , although the results for both generators are consistent with the analytical proof of diagonalization of the srg evolved hamiltonian presented in refs  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : binding ] we see the effect of the srg evolution on a simple variational calculation for the cases with @xmath2 . here and for illustration purposes",

    "a very similar behavior in the region @xmath392 is found for both the wilson and the wegner generators .",
    "however , as we can see , in the region of small @xmath10 the behavior for the wilson and the wegner generators is quite different and , near @xmath393 , a clear jump in the energies is observed . to understand how this surprising result comes about",
    "let us consider the calculation of the energy in further detail for the finite momentum grid which is used for the srg evolution .",
    "the kinetic and potential energy contributions become @xmath394 and @xmath395 [ p_m^2 \\phi_{\\rm rel , n } ( p_m ) ] v_{nm}(\\lambda ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] the @xmath373 states need to be renormalized on the grid as follows , @xmath396 ^ 2 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if one takes the infrared limit @xmath1 , the potential becomes diagonal and one gets @xmath397 we see the weight squared factor @xmath398 and _ naively _ in the @xmath59-fixed and @xmath399 continuum limit , we obtain @xmath400\\to 0 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] regardless on the ho parameter b. thus , the kinetic energy gets minimal for @xmath401 and hence the minimum takes place at zero energy . while this argument agrees with the behavior for the wegner generator observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] it fails to reproduce the trend found for the wilson generator .",
    "the flaw in the argument can be seen more clearly in the deuteron case , where @xmath402 note that with the exception of the deuteron state @xmath403 all others fulfill @xmath404 .",
    "the difference , however , is in the location of the bound - state after the srg evolution .",
    "the bound - state is located at the lowest point on the grid for the wilson generator and at some intermediate point for the wegner generator , @xmath405 however , the trial wave function is peaked at the origin , which on the finite momentum grid corresponds to the lowest momentum @xmath244 .",
    "using the fact that all @xmath404 with the exception of the bound - state we obtain @xmath406 of course , this argument holds in the infrared limit @xmath1 .",
    "a qualifying remark here becomes necessary : a distinction between the infrared limit @xmath407 and the value @xmath408 should be made as we are dealing with variational wave functions . for finite @xmath10 ,",
    "as long as the bound - state is not either shifted or anchored at some fixed place , the behavior for both generators will not essentially differ .",
    "the dramatic evolution of the potential can be more clearly seen by inspecting the sequence previously displayed .",
    "we see that the jump in the deuteron energy in the case of the wegner generator is directly related to the crossing of the hamiltonian diagonal matrix - element corresponding to the bound - state . a similar argument for the variational shell - model calculations for the cases with @xmath366 and @xmath367",
    "yields the results @xmath409 which is checked by the numerical calculations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] .",
    "note that the only contribution in the infrared limit @xmath1 stems in this case from the two - body bound - state .",
    "the continuum contributions in both the @xmath171 and @xmath172 channels vanish .    for completeness ,",
    "let us mention that as we evolve along the srg trajectory we also find linear correlations in two regimes @xmath410 the corresponding tjon - lines are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tjon ] .",
    "the gap in the wegner generator case can be clearly identified .",
    "we compare with the asymptotic lines @xmath390 and @xmath411 which were identified in our previous work  @xcite invoking three - body forces .",
    "the extrapolation of this formula gives @xmath412 , while the experimental value is @xmath413 . as we see , the sharp intersection between the two lines happens exactly at the srg cutoff @xmath10 where the jumps in the binding energies are observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] , which corresponds to the critical values @xmath414 and @xmath415 . the phenomenon we observe resembles closely an avoided crossing pattern , a phenomenon familiar from molecular physics in the born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite , where the adiabatic parameter is the triton binding - energy , @xmath416 . as we see , the variational calculation takes the minimal energy from the two possible branches in the wilson generator case since the variational @xmath417 state for the @xmath8-particle contains @xmath418 states with opposite spin polarization at rest .",
    "hence , the critical point corresponds to the break up process @xmath419 . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : tjon ] , this break - up component is absent in the wegner generator case and one jumps to the free @xmath420 state at rest at @xmath1 .",
    "our results generate a tjon - line , with a slope 4 for the srg cutoff below @xmath421 .",
    "we remind that this is the regime which so far remained unaccessible for realistic interactions , basically due to numerical difficulties triggered by the long momentum tail of the potentials . of course , while the generic features found here are expected to become universal as we approach the infrared , the accuracy of our results regarding the specific implications for nuclear binding should be tested , particularly since our solution is just a variational approximation .",
    "a thorough analysis of both the @xmath422 as well as neutron and nuclear matter extending preliminary results for realistic potentials  @xcite along the present lines will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the srg flow equations provide an example of an isospectral flow , i.e. a transformation which preserves the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian but rotates the eigenfunctions in such a way that transition matrix elements are increasingly and exponentially suppressed in the corresponding energy differences .",
    "this approach has offered new opportunities in nuclear physics as it allows the possibility of describing phase - equivalent interactions which conveniently become more diagonal .",
    "the practical implementation of the srg approach usually requires a discretization in momentum space .",
    "our analysis has therefore been performed on a finite momentum grid which makes the problem computationally manageable but also leads to specific features related to the formulation of the scattering problem .",
    "in particular two unitarily equivalent hamiltonians do not provide the same phase - shifts obtained by the solution of the ls equation on the grid .",
    "therefore , we have adopted the energy - shift definition of the discretized hamiltonian suggested many years ago by lifschits and extensively developped by kukulin _",
    "_ in more recent years within the context of the few - body problem .",
    "we have found suitable formulas correctly incorporating levinson s theorem . as a by - product",
    "we have also deduced momentum grid based generalized trace identities or finite energy sum rules put forward by jaffe _",
    "on the basis of analyticity .",
    "the energy - shift definition of the phase - shift is invariant along the srg trajectory but for the case of different generators such as those of wegner and wilson the behaviour when approaching the infrared limit turns out to be significantly different when bound - states are present . for @xmath106-dimensional hamiltonians",
    "the srg flow has always one unique stable fixed point . in the case of the wilson generator",
    "there are @xmath145 fixed points for non - degenerate hamiltonians but only one is exponentially stable . in the case of the wegner generator",
    "all @xmath145 fixed points are stable .",
    "we remind that the srg evolution with the different generators , while preserving the two - body spectrum , yields asymptotically to infrared fixed - points which only correspond to re - orderings of the eigenvalues and hence contain the same physics of the initial bare two - body hamiltonian .    with a simple toy model for the nuclear force",
    ", we explored the infrared limit of the srg evolution with both the wilson and the wegner generators .",
    "while the fixed point is the same for the two generators when no bound - state is supported by the interaction , we have two distinct fixed points when a bound - state is allowed .",
    "the evolution with the wegner generator provides the correct behavior of the interaction in the infrared limit @xmath1 and defines an ordering of the eigenvalues which can be used to compute the phase - shifts complying to levinson s theorem without solving the scattering equation .",
    "we provide a consistent prescription to shift the eigenvalues in order to obtain the nuclear force in the infrared limit @xmath1 and also to compute the phase - shifts from the eigenvalues with the correct behavior in both low- and high - momentum regions .",
    "even though the ordering of states induced by the srg evolution with the wegner generator make the phase - shift at low - momentum compliant to levinson s theorem , there is an optimal ordering which gives the smoothest phase - shifts around the bound - state scale .",
    "the optimal ordering corresponds to a shift of the eigenvalues below the bound - state scale while keeping the ascending order above it .",
    "the optimal value for the position of the deuteron bound - state , which minimizes the rms errors , seems to approach the characteristic deuteron momentum scale @xmath363 .",
    "of course , it must be verified through explicit calculations if this a general result , which holds for any weakly or strongly coupled bound - state .    with the srg evolution carried out towards @xmath1 ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath171 and @xmath172 channels due to the deuteron bound - state can be seen very clearly .",
    "the infrared limit of the srg evolution with the wilson generator actually corresponds to an ascending order for the eigenvalues of the interaction , while the wegner generator preserves the ascending order only above the bound - state scale .",
    "we have also analyzed the @xmath366 and @xmath367 systems within a simple harmonic oscillator scheme where the main differences between different generators may be clearly appreciated as the critical scale is approached .",
    "there appear two branches @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the system takes the lowest energy at any rate among all possible states contained in the trial wave function .",
    "our results generate a tjon - line which matches the expression @xmath423 found by invoking three - body forces in our previous work for the srg cutoff below @xmath421 ( the factor 4 corresponds to 4 triplets )  @xcite .",
    "we remind that this is the regime which so far remained unaccessible for realistic interactions .",
    "the accuracy of the tjon formula is rather satisfactory and a complementary investigation going beyond the simple variational ansatz and including specifically many - body forces would be most illuminating .",
    "the application of the on - shell interactions to few - nucleon systems , light nuclei and nuclear many - body problems ( neutron and nuclear matter ) for realistic interactions is beyond the scope of this work but is certainly an interesting study we will pursue in forthcoming works on the light of the present findings .",

    "<S> we study the infrared limit of the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) using a simple toy model for the nuclear force aiming to investigate the fixed points of the srg evolution with both the wilson and the wegner generators . </S>",
    "<S> we show how a fully diagonal interaction at the similarity cutoff @xmath0 may be obtained from the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and quantify the diagonalness by means of operator norms . </S>",
    "<S> while the fixed points for both generators are equivalent when no bound - states are allowed by the interaction , the differences arising from the presence of the deuteron bound - state can be disentangled very clearly by analyzing the evolved interactions in the infrared limit @xmath1 on a finite momentum grid . </S>",
    "<S> another issue we investigate is the location on the diagonal of the hamiltonian in momentum - space where the srg evolution places the deuteron bound - state eigenvalue once it reaches the fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> this finite momentum grid setup provides an alternative derivation of the celebrated trace identities , as a by product . </S>",
    "<S> the different effects due to either the wilson or the wegner generators on the binding energies of @xmath2 systems are investigated and related to the ocurrence of a tjon - line which emerges as the minimum of an avoided crossing between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> all infrared features of the flow equations are illustrated using the toy model for the two - nucleon @xmath5-waves . </S>"
