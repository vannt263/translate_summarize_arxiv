    "one of the important pursuits in the field of quantum computation is the determination of computationally efficient ways to synthesize any desired unitary gate from fundamental quantum logic gates .",

    "this may be considered a measure of how efficiently an operation may be implemented using fundamental gates .",
    "an approach linking efficient quantum circuit design to the problem of finding a least path - length trajectory on a manifold was taken up in @xcite ; the path length was related to minimizing a cost function to an associated control problem ( with _ specific _ riemannian metrics as the cost function ) .",
    "this approach was later generalized in @xcite to use a more general class of riemannian metrics as cost functions to obtain bounds on the complexity . in @xcite",
    "the authors use pontryagins maximum principle from optimal control theory to obtain a minimum time implementation of quantum algorithms .",
    "alternative techniques using lie group decomposition methods to obtain the optimal sequence of gates to synthesize a unitary were developed in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we use the method of dynamic programming from the theory of optimal control to determine the sequence of one and two qubit gates which implement a desired unitary .",
    "we solve the problem using one and two qubit hamiltonians as the control vector fields , in contrast to the approach in @xcite which used the concept of preferred hamiltonians .",
    "in addition we demonstrate numerical results on an example problem in @xmath0 and obtain controls which may be then be used to split any gate into a product of fundamental unitaries .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we provide a review of the definitions of gate complexity , approximate gate complexity and the control problem associated with the bounds on these quantities .",
    "we describe , in section [ sec : dynproggatecomplexity ] how this control problem can be solved using dynamic programming techniques from mathematical control theory .",
    "this is followed by a demonstration , in section [ sec : exampleproblem ] , of the theory developed to an example problem on @xmath0 ; wherein simulation results and sample optimal trajectories are obtained .",
    "in this section we recall the notion of gate complexity and its relation to the cost function for an associated control problem as in @xcite .      as outlined in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 4 ) , in quantum computation each desired quantum algorithm may be defined by a sequence of unitary operators @xmath1 .",
    "each of these @xmath2 is an element of the lie group @xmath3 and represents the action of the algorithm on an @xmath4-qubit input .",
    "the gate complexity @xmath5 of a unitary @xmath6 is the minimal number of one and two qubit gates required to synthesize @xmath6 exactly , without help from ancilla qubits @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm is a measure of the scaling of the amount of basic resources required to synthesize the algorithm , with respect to input size .    in practice",
    "however , computations need not be exact . to perform a desired computation @xmath6 , it may suffice to synthesize a unitary @xmath7 with accuracy @xmath8 , i.e @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 denotes the standard matrix norm in a particular representation of the group .",
    "this notion gives rise to the definition of the approximate gate complexity @xmath11 as the minimal number of one and two qubit gates required to synthesize @xmath6 up to accuracy @xmath8 .",
    "we outline below a control problem on the lie group @xmath3 such that the cost function associated with it provides upper and lower bounds on the gate complexity problem .",
    "the system evolution for the control problem occurs on @xmath12 with associated lie algebra @xmath13 .",
    "note that in this article the definition of @xmath14 is taken to be the collection of traceless hermitian matrices ( which differs from the mathematicians convention by a factor of @xmath15 ) .",
    "the system equation contains a set of right invariant vector fields @xmath16 which correspond to a set of one and two qubit hamiltonians . the lie algebra generated by the set @xmath17 is assumed to be @xmath18 .",
    "this assumption along with the fact that @xmath12 is compact imply that the system is controllable @xcite(and hence the minimum time to move between any two points on @xmath12 is finite ) .",
    "the system dynamics for the gate design problem is described as follows : @xmath19 with the initial condition @xmath20 and with a bound @xmath21 on the norm of the available control vector fields @xmath22 using any suitable norm on their matrix representation .",
    "the control @xmath23 is an element of the class of piecewise continuous functions with their range belonging to a compact subset @xmath24 of the real @xmath25-dimensional euclidian space ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we denote this class of functions by @xmath27 .",
    "hence @xmath28 .",
    "given a control signal @xmath23 and an initial unitary @xmath6 the solution to eq   at time @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath30 . in addition , by a simple time reversal argument it can be seen that the problem of obtaining a desired unitary gate @xmath6 starting from the identity can be reframed as a problem of reaching the identity element starting at @xmath6 .",
    "note the difference between the system described herein and that outlined in the control problem in @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the control hamiltonians used are the ones which generate the one and two qubit unitaries ; therefore the concept of preferred vs allowed hamiltonians is not utilized here .",
    "the controls used may in fact be any bracket - generating subset of the vector fields which generate one and two qubit unitaries .",
    "we now define some terms to be used in this article : for @xmath31 and @xmath32    time to reach the identity using control @xmath23 : :    @xmath33    +    the infimum in eq is infinite if the terminal constraint    @xmath34 is not attained .",

    "note that as long as    @xmath39 has a minimum greater than zero , the bounds on it    can be recast in the form @xmath40 .",
    "optimal cost function : :    @xmath41    +    this optimal cost function will be used to provide bounds on the gate    complexity .",
    "hence the control problem is to find the values of @xmath23 in order to optimize the cost function .",
    "the boundedness of the time taken to achieve the desired objective ( due to controllability ) , together with the boundedness of @xmath39 , implies that the cost function is bounded .",
    "in addition , the control problem may also be generalized to systems evolving on any compact connected lie group @xmath42 with the cost @xmath43 being dependent on both @xmath44 and @xmath36 .",

    "hence the upper bound on the approximate gate complexity satisfies @xmath52 this motivates the solution to certain related optimal control problems in order to obtain bounds on the complexity of related quantum algorithms .",
    "in addition , the solutions to such optimal control problems help determine the sequence of one and two qubit gates used to generate the desired unitary as described in the following section .",
    "in this section we introduce the tools of dynamic programming which have had widespread application in control theory .",
    "we then apply this theory to solve the control problem associated with determination of the bounds on gate complexity and explain how to use the solution to the control problem to obtain the sequence of gates required to reach any given unitary .      the dynamic programming principle states that :",
    "an optimal policy has the property that , whatever the initial state and optimal first decision may be , the remaining decisions constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision@xcite . the use of this principle involves recursively solving a problem by breaking it down into several sub - problems followed by determining the optimal strategy for each of those sub - problems .",
    "for example , consider the following problem :    [ example : dpp ]    let the state of a system be described by a vector in some vector space @xmath42 . moving from one point to another",
    "is done by exerting a control chosen from a compact control set @xmath24 ( we assume full controllability of the system using controls from this set ) . any control",
    "@xmath23 exerted starting at a point @xmath53 in this space leads to a point denoted as @xmath54 , while incurring a cost .",
    "this cost of exerting the control may depend on the point at which the control starts being applied as well as on the control signal itself .",
    "the objective is to reach from a point @xmath55 to a point @xmath56 in that vector space while incurring as low a cost as possible .",
    "let the cost of reaching @xmath56 from any point @xmath53 using control @xmath23 be denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "the cost at any point is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "the dynamic programming principle implies : @xmath59 also from the definition of @xmath60 we have that for any @xmath61 , there exists a control @xmath62 s.t @xmath63 hence,@xmath64 in the limit @xmath65 we have that : @xmath66 equations and imply the dynamic programming equation @xmath67 @xmath68    solving a control problem using this principle involves setting up and solving a recursion equation as above .",
    "there are several references which provide a detailed and rigorous introduction to this theory viz @xcite .",
    "we now apply this theory to obtain bounds on the gate complexity .      by the procedure described in example ( [ example : dpp ] ) in the previous sub - section , we have that the dynamic programming equation for the optimal cost function in eq is @xmath69 for all initial points @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 is the indicator function of the set @xmath73 taking on the value of @xmath74 inside the set and zero outside it .",
    "thus , @xmath75 is @xmath74 if @xmath76 .",
    "now we describe a formal derivation to obtain the differential version of the dynamic programming equation(dpe ) . for sufficiently small @xmath29",
    "we have from eq that : @xmath77    now transposing @xmath78 to the right hand side , dividing by @xmath29 and taking the limit as @xmath79 we obtain : @xmath80\\right\\}\\\\ 0 = & \\mathop { \\sup } \\limits_{v\\,\\in\\,\\mathbf{v } } \\left\\{-\\ell(v ) - dc(u_0)\\left[-i\\,\\{\\sum_{k=1}^m v_k(t ) h_k\\ } x\\right]\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the equation above @xmath81 denotes the derivative of the function @xmath82 at a point @xmath6 on the lie group @xmath12 .",

    "we numerically synthesize the optimal controls using techniques such as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) where the solutions to the discretized version tend towards the solution of the original continuous description .",
    "the solution to the hjb gives the control sequence to be applied to reach the identity element .",
    "this is the crucial step in the control synthesis . from the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula",
    "@xcite we know that @xmath88 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are any hermitian operators .",
    "this implies that in a one qubit system , a unitary generated by any element of the lie algebra of a one qubit system can be approximated as closely as desired by the product of unitaries generated by flowing along the available one and two qubit control hamiltonians ( given the bracket generating assumption mentioned previously ) .",
    "we now recall two statements regarding the universality of gates and gate synthesis using a product of two level unitaries below .    1 .   a single qubit and a c - not gate are universal i.e produce any two level unitary ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.5.2 ) .",
    "an arbitrary unitary matrix on a @xmath89-dimensional hilbert space can be written exactly as a product of two level unitaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.5.1 ) .",
    "these statements together with eq indicate that once we have a control vector from the solution of the hjb equation , it is possible to synthesize a one and two qubit gate sequence to approximate a desired unitary to as good an accuracy as required .",
    "we now use the theory introduced to consider an example on the special unitary group .",
    "we wish to construct any element of @xmath0 using the available hamiltonians @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the system dynamics on @xmath0 is given by : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 in this case @xmath95 .",
    "this cost function in effect measures the distance along the manifold to generate the desired unitary . due to the fact that cost function does not depend on the magnitude of the control signal applied",
    ", the problem essentially involves choosing the direction to flow along ( with maximum magnitude ) , at each point on the manifold in order to reach the destination in the smallest possible time . hence the direction ( and thus the path )",
    "is chosen in order to minimize the the distancealong the manifold .",
    "thus this minimum time control problem is related to the original gate complexity problem .",
    "the minimum time problem in quantum mechanics has also attracted interest in other articles @xcite .",

    "the optimal control is chosen according to the eq .",
    "now , in order to obtain the numerical solution to this problem we proceed as follows . instead of using the value function @xmath82 directly",
    ", it is advantageous to use the monotone transformation ( kruskov transform ) @xmath98 which leads to the following hjb equation ( using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.5 ) ) : @xmath99 with the hamiltonian term @xmath100 being the same as in eq  .",
    "the function @xmath101 can be interpreted as a discounted minimum time function for the system in eq  .",
    "therefore from the dynamic programming principle @xmath101 would satisfy @xmath102    this normalization ( discounting ) is useful for better numerical convergence and is also used in the uniqueness proofs of the solutions to the dynamic programming equations . to obtain a numerical solution to the dynamic programming problem , we parameterize points in @xmath0 using a mapping of the form @xmath103 from the euclidian space .",
    "note that the parametrization is not unique , since multiple points in the three dimensional euclidian space @xmath104 map to the same point in @xmath0 .",
    "note that since hjb equation in this case is linear in @xmath23 , the optimal @xmath23 lies on the boundary of the compact set @xmath24 at ( almost ) every time instant .",
    "this simplification reflects the results from @xcite where determining the geodesic ( which are paths of constant magnitude of the velocity ) involves choosing an optimal direction along which to flow .",
    "the method of discretization of eqns  , which are used to obtain the simulation results , will be described later in this article .",
    "figure [ fig : timecomparisonsu2ckt ] indicates the slices along a quadrent of the co - ordinate axes of the actual minimum time function @xmath82 ( which corresponds via eq   to the normalized minimum function @xmath101 , obtained by solving the hjb eq  ) .",
    "the figure is presented as a gray - scale image in a three dimensional grid .",
    "the axes correspond to the three parameters used for the representation of @xmath0 as described above .",
    "a lighter shading indicates a larger value of the minimum time function at a point , while a darker shading implies a smaller time to reach the identity element when starting from that point .",
    "time optimal trajectories for this example are indicated in figure [ fig : mintimepathexamplesu2 ] .",
    "note that the non - uniqueness of the representation leads to having to carefully interpret the paths when they are shown in flat space .",
    "observe that since there is no direct vector field to control along @xmath105 , the path to the identity starting from a point along @xmath105 is not a straight line unlike in the case of the other two axes ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "the discretization of this system for obtaining numerical solutions to the hjb equation ( [ eq : hjbdiscounted : su2example ] ) is carried out using the finite difference procedure in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.5 ) . in three dimensional euclidian space with a grid spacing @xmath106 of the space and basis vectors @xmath107 ,",
    "the value iteration equation ( which is the iteration of the cost function , say @xmath108  ) is given by : @xmath109 where @xmath110 here @xmath111 are the @xmath15 th components of the vector valued function @xmath112 .",
    "note that the optimal control for this system is a specific case of eq  , where the possible values of the spatial co - ordinates are the locations of the grid points which in turn depend on the mesh generated for the discretization . these discretized equations and the controls resulting therefrom are used to obtain the simulation results indicated in the figures in this article .",
    "once the controls are determined , we can generate the one and two qubit unitaries which efficiently approximate this control trajectory as explained in section [ sec : obtaininggateimplementations ] .",
