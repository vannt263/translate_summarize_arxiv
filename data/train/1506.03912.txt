    "let @xmath2 be the ring of algebraic integers in the imaginary quadratic number field @xmath3 ; the _ bianchi groups _ are the projective special linear groups psl@xmath4 . in this paper , we establish formulae for the part due to torsion of the bredon homology of the bianchi groups , with respect to the family @xmath5 of finite subgroups and coefficients in the complex representation ring @xmath6 , from which we deduce their equivariant @xmath0-homology .",
    "then we use the fact that the baum  connes assembly map from the equivariant @xmath0-homology to the @xmath0-theory of the reduced @xmath7-algebras of the bianchi groups is an isomorphism .",
    "this has been inspired by works of sanchez - garcia @xcite , and allows us to obtain the isomorphism type of the latter operator @xmath0-theory , which would be extremely hard to compute from the reduced @xmath7-algebras .",
    "case - by - case computations on the machine have already been carried out for the equivariant @xmath0-homology of the bianchi groups  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a way to extend them to non - trivial class group cases , alternative to the current implementation by the author ) , but by their nature , they can of course only cover a small finite collection of bianchi groups . in order to obtain the desired formulae for all bianchi groups , we set up an adaptation to bredon homology of _ torsion subcomplex reduction _ ,",
    "a technique which has recently been formulated for group homology  @xcite , and some elements of which had already been used earlier on as ad hoc tricks by soul  @xcite . a priori , it is possible with our methods to treat any discrete group with a nice action on a cell complex ; and another class of examples for this is work in advanced progress jointly with lafont , ortiz and sanchez - garcia  @xcite , namely hyperbolic coxeter groups , many of which are not arithmetic",
    ". please note that definitions of bredon homology and equivariant @xmath0-homology are given in  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite , so we will not recall them in this paper .",
    "denote by @xmath8 the classifying space for proper actions of @xmath9 , and denote by @xmath10 the orbit space .",
    "[ splitting ] let @xmath9 be a bianchi group or one of their subgroups . then the bredon homology @xmath11 is concentrated in degrees @xmath12 and splits as a direct sum over    1 .   the orbit space homology @xmath13 , 2 .   a submodule @xmath14 determined by a reduced @xmath15torsion subcomplex for @xmath16 3 .   and a submodule @xmath17 determined by a reduced @xmath18torsion subcomplex for @xmath16 .",
    "these submodules are given as follows , except for psl@xmath1 over the gaussian and eisensteinian integers .",
    "the additional units in these two rings induce some particularities which we would like to avoid .",
    "this does not cause any harm , because the bredon homology and equivariant @xmath0-homology of these two bianchi groups have already been computed  @xcite .",
    "so for the remainder of this article , the term `` bianchi group '' will stand for psl@xmath1 over a ring of imaginary quadratic integers excluding these two .    [ 2 ] the part due to @xmath15-torsion of the bredon complex of a bianchi group @xmath9 has homology    @xmath19    where @xmath20 counts the number of conjugacy classes of subgroups of type @xmath21 in @xmath9 , @xmath22 counts the conjugacy classes of those of them which are not contained in any @xmath15-dihedral subgroup , and @xmath23 counts the number of @xmath15-dihedral subgroups , whether or not they are contained in a tetrahedral subgroup of @xmath9 .    [ 3 ] the part due to @xmath18-torsion of the bredon complex of a bianchi group @xmath9 has homology    @xmath24    where amongst the subgroups of type @xmath25 in @xmath9 , @xmath26 counts the number of conjugacy classes of those of them which are not contained in any @xmath18-dihedral subgroup , and @xmath27 counts the conjugacy classes of those of them which are contained in some @xmath18-dihedral subgroup in @xmath9 .",
    "note that there are formulae for the numbers @xmath28 and @xmath27 in terms of elementary number - theoretic quantities  @xcite , which are very easy to evaluate on the machine  @xcite*appendix .",
    "together with theorem  [ bredon_to_k - homology ] below , we obtain the following formulae for the equivariant @xmath0-homology of the bianchi groups . note for this purpose that for a bianchi group @xmath9 , there is a model for @xmath9 of dimension 2 , so @xmath29 is torsion - free .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that the naive euler characteristic of the bianchi groups vanishes ( again excluding the two special cases of gaussian and eisensteinian integers ) , for @xmath30 we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for any bianchi group @xmath9 , the short exact sequence of theorem  [ bredon_to_k - homology ] splits into @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 .",
    "a table evaluating these formulas for a range of bianchi groups is given in appendix [ the appendix ] .",
    "that table agrees with the machine calculations which were carried out by the author for all cases of class number @xmath35 and @xmath15 with  @xcite in the way described in the author s phd thesis  @xcite ( only the cases of class number @xmath35 were covered at that time ) , following the method of @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the equivariant @xmath0-homology of @xmath9 is given by 2-periodicity .",
    "+ as the baum - connes conjecture is verified by the bianchi groups , these equivariant @xmath0-homology groups are isomorphic to the @xmath0-theory of the reduced group @xmath7-algebras .      in section  [ the cell complex ] ,",
    "we describe the cell complex on which we study the bianchi groups through their action . in section  [ recalls ] , we make recalls about the bredon chain complex ; in section  [ tsr ] , we recall torsion subcomplexes and their reduction . in section  [ representation ring splitting ] , we give the proof of theorem [ splitting ] . in section",
    "[ reduction of the torsion subcomplexes ] , we give the proof of theorems  [ 2 ] and  [ 3 ] .",
    "section  [ general ] is a study on how the methods of this paper can be generalised , and establishes a statement for arbitrary classifying spaces for proper actions with zero - dimensional singular part .",
    "we summarize information on the assembly map for the bianchi groups in section  [ the assembly map ] .",
    "section  [ the appendix ] appends results from machine computations on the bredon homology of the bianchi groups .",
    "the author would like to thank , alain valette and especially rubn snchez - garca for helpful discussions , and an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
    "in order to construct a suitable model for @xmath36 when @xmath9 is a bianchi group , we start with the natural action of @xmath37 sl@xmath38 on its associated symmetric space sl@xmath39 .",
    "the latter space is isomorphic to hyperbolic @xmath18-space @xmath40 , and under this isomorphism , the action can be expressed by the mbius transformation formula when embedding @xmath40 into the quaternions for carrying out the occurring division .",
    "this action makes @xmath40 into a model for @xmath36 , but not a cocompact one ; a fact which is annoying for bredon homology computations . in order to reach the desired cocompactness , one could for instance apply the borel ",
    "serre compactification ; but for explicit homological computations , it is more convenient to construct a @xmath15-dimensional @xmath9-equivariant retract of @xmath40 .",
    "a very conceptual way for such a construction is to use the reduction theory of borel and harish - chandra .",
    "this has been done by harder  @xcite , put into practice for the bianchi groups by his student mendoza  @xcite and implemented on the machine by vogtmann  @xcite . for a reader desiring to extend the present investigations to other arithmetic groups",
    ", this construction should be the method of choice .",
    "however , the above mentioned computer implementation has not been preserved over time , and the author has implemented a different model for @xmath36 in order to produce the machine results presented in the appendix ( section  [ the appendix ] ) . that model , due to flge  @xcite , comes with some peculiarities as one does first adjoin the singular cusps of the @xmath9-action to @xmath40 before retracting @xmath9-equivariantly ( see details in  @xcite ) . in order to keep the cell stabilisers finite",
    ", one has therefore to start , instead of with @xmath40 , with its borel  serre bordification .",
    "then at the cusps , one gets @xmath15-tori instead of points stabilised by fundamental groups of @xmath15-tori . a variation of this has been pursued in detail by fuchs  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as flge s model is obtained from the boundary of bianchi s fundamental polyhedron , it allows to study the geometry of the bianchi groups using the insights of old masters like luigi  bianchi  @xcite , felix  klein  @xcite and henri poincar  @xcite .",
    "we note that the harder ",
    "mendoza model and the flge model coincide when the ring of integers is a principal ideal domain , because then there are no singular cusps .",
    "the reader may choose to think of the @xmath9-equivariant retract @xmath41 of @xmath40 in this paper either as the harder ",
    "mendoza model or as the flge model , according to her or his research interests .",
    "what is important in any case , is to provide @xmath41 with a @xmath9-invariant cell structure in which @xmath9 does not perform any `` inversions '' of cells ( mapping a cell to itself without restricting to the identity map on that cell ) . for theoretical purposes ,",
    "this can always be achieved using the barycentric subdivision of a given cell structure ; but for explicit computations , one should instead make a subdivision along the symmetries of the cells .",
    "such a subdivision of @xmath41 has been achieved on the machine  @xcite , and has been used for the appendix ( section  [ the appendix ] ) . as a consequence of any subdivision which eliminates the `` inversions '' of cells ,    * the @xmath15-cells of @xmath41",
    "are trivially stabilised ; * any @xmath35-cell stabiliser is of isomorphism type @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and performs a rotation of order @xmath44 on @xmath40 such that its @xmath35-cell is on the rotation axis .    on the @xmath45-cells ,",
    "obviously any stabilising map restricts to the identity map , so the cell stabiliser can be any of the finite subgroups of @xmath9 .",
    "as described in  @xcite , the equivariant @xmath0-homology of the classifying space for proper actions @xmath46 can be computed by means of the bredon homology with coefficients in the complex representation ring , @xmath47 .",
    "more precisely , when we have a classifying space for proper actions of dimension at most 2 , then the atiyah  hirzebruch spectral sequence from its bredon homology to its equivariant degenerates on the @xmath48-page and directly yields the following .",
    "[ bredon_to_k - homology ] let @xmath49 be an arbitrary group such that @xmath50 .",
    "then there is a natural short exact sequence @xmath51 and a natural isomorphism @xmath52 .",
    "we will follow snchez - garca s treatment @xcite .",
    "+ consider the bianchi group we use the @xmath15-dimensional model @xmath41 for @xmath8 described in section  [ the cell complex ] .",
    "denote by @xmath53 the stabiliser of a cell @xmath54 , and by @xmath55 the complex representation ring of a group @xmath49 .",
    "we will study the bredon chain complex @xmath56 & \\bigoplus\\limits_{\\sigma \\in \\thinspace_\\gamma \\backslash x^{(2 ) } } r_{{\\mathbb{c}}}(\\gamma_\\sigma ) \\ar[r]^{\\psi_2 } &   \\bigoplus\\limits_{\\sigma \\in \\thinspace_\\gamma \\backslash x^{(1 ) } } r_{{\\mathbb{c}}}(\\gamma_\\sigma )   \\ar[r]^{\\psi_1 } & \\bigoplus\\limits_{\\sigma \\in \\thinspace_\\gamma \\backslash x^{(0 ) } } r_{{\\mathbb{c}}}(\\gamma_\\sigma ) \\ar[r ] & 0 , } \\ ] ] of our @xmath9-cell complex @xmath41 . as @xmath41 is a model for the classifying space for proper @xmath9-actions ,",
    "the homology of this bredon chain complex is the bredon homology @xmath57 of  @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in this section we recall the @xmath58torsion subcomplexes theory of  @xcite for the calculation of group homology , which we are going to adapt to the calculation of bredon homology in this paper .",
    "we require any discrete group @xmath9 under our study to be provided with a @xmath59__cell complex _ _ , that is a finite - dimensional cell complex @xmath41 with cellular @xmath9action such that each cell stabilizer fixes its cell point - wise .",
    "let @xmath58 be a prime number .          with the splitting of theorem [ splitting ] ,",
    "we obtain a bredon homology analogue of the above proposition , finding for each occurring prime @xmath58 a component of the bredon homology carried by the @xmath58torsion subcomplex .    for a given bianchi group , the @xmath58torsion subcomplex can be quite large .",
    "it turns out to be useful to reduce this subcomplex , and we identify two conditions under which we can do this in a way that proposition  [ brownian ] still holds .",
    "[ cell condition ] in the @xmath58torsion subcomplex , let @xmath54 be a cell of dimension @xmath61 which lies in the boundary of precisely two @xmath44cells representing different orbits , @xmath62 and  @xmath63 . assume further that no higher - dimensional cells of the @xmath58torsion subcomplex touch @xmath54 ; and that the @xmath44cell stabilizers admit an isomorphism @xmath64 .",
    "when both conditions are satisfied in the @xmath58torsion subcomplex , we merge the cells @xmath62 and @xmath63 along  @xmath54 and do so for their entire orbits .",
    "the effect of this merging is to decrease the size of the @xmath58torsion subcomplex without changing its @xmath9equivariant farrell cohomology .",
    "this process can often be repeated : by a `` terminal vertex , '' we will denote a vertex with no adjacent higher - dimensional cells and precisely one adjacent edge in the quotient space , and by `` cutting off '' the latter edge , we will mean that we remove the edge together with the terminal vertex from our cell complex .",
    "the _ reduced @xmath58torsion subcomplex _ associated to a @xmath9cell complex  @xmath41 is the cell complex obtained by recursively merging orbit - wise all the pairs of cells satisfying conditions  @xmath68 and  @xmath69 , and cutting off edges that admit a terminal vertex when condition  @xmath69 is satisfied .",
    "the following theorem , stating that proposition  [ brownian ] still holds after reducing , is proved in  @xcite : _ there is an isomorphism between the @xmath58primary parts of the farrell cohomology of  @xmath9 and the @xmath9equivariant farrell cohomology of the reduced @xmath58torsion subcomplex .",
    "_ in the case of a trivial kernel of the action on the @xmath9cell complex , this allows one to establish general formulae for the farrell cohomology of  @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "analogously , we will use our adaptation of torsion subcomplex reduction to bredon homology in order to prove the formulae in theorems  [ 2 ] and  [ 3 ] ."
