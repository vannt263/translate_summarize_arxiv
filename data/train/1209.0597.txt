    "the collective elementary excitations of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron - hole ( e - h ) systems in a strong perpendicular magnetic field are discussed in the frame of the bogoliubov theory of quasiaverages [ 1 ] taking into account the phenomena related with the spontaneous breaking of the continuous symmetries .",
    "the main results in this field have been obtained thanks to the fundamental papers by goldstone [ 2 ] , nambu [ 3 ] , higgs [ 4 ] and weinberg [ 5 ] .",
    "these investigations were influenced by the success of the theory of superconductivity developed originally by bardin , cooper and schriffer [ 6 ] , refined later by bogoliubov [ 1 ] as well as by the microscopic theory of superfluidity proposed by bogoliubov [ 1 ] .",
    "the specific implementation of these concepts and theorems in the case of 2d magnetoexcitons with direct implication of the plasmon - type excitations side - by - side with the exciton - type branches of the energy spectrum is the main topic of the present review .",
    "the coplanar electrons and holes in a strong perpendicular magnetic field at low temperatures form the magnetoexcitons , when the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes lying on the lowest landau levels ( llls ) plays the main role . however , when the electrons and holes are spatially separated on the different layers of the double quantum well ( dqw ) the coulomb e - h interaction diminishes , and the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) on one layer and the two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) on another layer are formed .",
    "their properties under the conditions of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) can influence the properties of the 2d magnetoexcitons . to the best of our knowledge these aspects of the magnetoexciton physics were not discussed in literature .",
    "a short review is given on the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the quantum hall excitons ( qhexs ) arising in the bilayer electron systems under the conditions of the fqhe at one half filling factor for each layer and the total filling factor equal to unity for both layers .",
    "this enables us to compare the phenomenon of the bec of coplanar magnetoexcitons and of qhexs .",
    "such comparison provides better understanding of the underlying physics and allows to verify accuracy of the made approximations .",
    "because the point vortices play an important role in the understanding of the fqhe the corresponding additional information should be included . the possibility to consider the bec at @xmath1 as an estimate for the finite temperatures below the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition is suggested .",
    "the article is organized as follow . in section 2",
    "the bogoliubov theory of the quasiaverages is overviewed .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the goldstone theorem .",
    "the nambu - goldstone modes arising under the condition of bec of the sodium atoms are enumerated in section 4 .",
    "the breaking of the local gauge symmetry and the higgs phenomenon are discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the quasi - nambu - goldstone modes . in section 7 the ginzburg - landau theory for the fqhe",
    "is formulated .",
    "the 2d point quantum vortices are described in section 8 .",
    "the existence of the statistical gauge vector potential generated by the vortices is considered in section 9 .",
    "the bec of qhexs and the energy spectrum of elementary excitations under these conditions are discussed in section 10 .",
    "section 11 contains the main results concerning the energy spectrum of the exciton and plasmon branches of the collective elementary excitations of the bose - einstein condensed coplanar magnetoexcitons .",
    "n.n . bogoliubov [ 1 ] has demonstrated his concept of quasiaverages using the ideal bose - gas model with the hamiltonian @xmath2 here @xmath3 are the bose operators of creation and annihilation of particles , and @xmath4 is their chemical potential .",
    "the occupation numbers of the particles are @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the normal state ,",
    "the density of particles in the thermodynamic limit at @xmath8 becomes @xmath9 . at this point ,",
    "the bose - einstein condensation occurs and a finite value of the density of condensed particles appears in the thermodynamic limit @xmath10 the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 asymptotically become @xmath13numbers , when their commutator @xmath14 = % \\dfrac{1}{v}\\ ] ] asymptotically tends to zero and their product is equal to @xmath15",
    ". then one can write @xmath16 on the other hand , the regular averages of the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) are exactly equal to zero .",
    "it is the consequence of the commutativity of the operator @xmath17 and the operator of the total particle number @xmath18 as follows @xmath19=0.\\ ] ] as a result , the operators @xmath17 is invariant with respect to the unitary transformation @xmath20 with an arbitrary angle @xmath21 .",
    "this invariance is called gradient invariance of the first kind or gauge invariance . when @xmath21 does not depend on the coordinate @xmath22 , we have the global gauge invariance and in the case @xmath23 it is called local gauge invariance [ 2 - 8 ] or gauge invariance of the second kind .",
    "the invariance ( 7 ) implies @xmath24 , which leads to the following average value @xmath25 because @xmath21 is an arbitrary angle , there are the selection rules : @xmath26 the regular average ( 8) can also be obtained from the asymptotical expressions ( 5 ) if they are integrated over the angle @xmath27 .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be resolved if hamiltonian ( 1 ) is supplemented by additional term @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fixed angle and @xmath30 is infinitesimal value .",
    "new hamiltonian has the form @xmath31 it does not conserve the condensate number . now",
    "the regular average values of the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 over the hamiltonian @xmath32 differ from zero , i.e. , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the definition of the quasiaverages designated by @xmath35 is the limit of the regular average @xmath36 when @xmath30 tends to zero @xmath37 it is important to emphasize that the limit @xmath38 must be effectuated after the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 , @xmath40 . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath4 is also infinitesimal , and it is possible to choose the ratio of two infinitesimal values @xmath4 and @xmath30 obtaining a finite value @xmath41 to calculate the regular average @xmath42 one needs to represent the hamiltonian ( 10 ) @xmath32 in a diagonal form with the aid of the canonical transformation over the amplitudes @xmath43 in terms of the new variables the hamiltonian @xmath32 takes the form @xmath44 in the diagonal representation ( 14 ) , the regular average value @xmath45 exactly equals to zero , while the value @xmath46 is equal to the first term on the right - hand side of formulas ( 13 ) .    as a result , the quasiaverage @xmath47 is @xmath48 it depends on the fixed angle @xmath29 and does not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "the spontaneous global gauge symmetry breaking is implied when the phase @xmath29 of the condensate amplitude in hamiltonian ( 10 ) is fixed .",
    "when the interaction between the particles is taken into account , these differences appear for other amplitudes as well .",
    "they give rise to the renormalization of the energy spectrum of the collective elementary excitations .",
    "in such a way , the canonical transformation @xmath49 introduced for the first time by bogoliubov [ 1 ] in his theory of superfluidity , has a quantum - statistical foundation within the framework of the quasiaverage concept . at @xmath1",
    "the quasiaverage @xmath35 coincides with the average over the quantum - mechanical ground state , which is the coherent macroscopic state [ 9 ] .",
    "the phenomena related to the spontaneous breaking of the continuous symmetry play an important role in statistical physics.some elements of this concept , such as the coherent macroscopic state with a given fixed phase and the displacement canonical transformation of the field operator describing the bose - einstein condensate , were introduced by bogoliubov in the microscopical theory of superfluidity [ 1 ] and were generalized in his theory of quasiaverages [ 1 ] noted above . the brief review of the gauge symmetries , their spontaneous breaking , goldstone and higgs effects will be presented below following the ryder s monograph [ 7 ] and berestetskii s lectures [ 8 ] .",
    "goldstone has considered a simple model of the complex scalar bose field to demonstrate his main idea . in the classical description",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath50 the potential energy @xmath51 has the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is considered as a parameter only , rather than a mass term , @xmath54 is the parameter of self - interaction , whereas the denotations @xmath55 and @xmath56 mean @xmath57 the lagrangian is invariant under the global gauge transformation @xmath58 it has the global gauge symmetry .",
    "the ground state is obtained by minimizing the potential as follows@xmath59 of interest is the case @xmath60 , when the minima are situated along the ring @xmath61 the function @xmath51 is shown in fig .",

    "there is a set of degenerate vacuums related to each other by rotation .",

    "as was pointed in [ 7 ] , the physical fields are the excitations above the vacuum .",
    "they can be realized by performing perturbations about @xmath70 .",
    "expanding the lagrangian ( 17 ) in series of the infinitesimal perturbations @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and neglecting by the constant terms , we obtain @xmath75 or in polar description @xmath76\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] neglecting by the cubic and quartic terms , we will see that there are the quadratic terms only of the type @xmath77 and @xmath78 , but there is no quadratic terms proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for real physical problems , for example , for the field theory , the field components @xmath81 and @xmath82 represent massive particles and dispersion laws with energy gap , whereas the field components @xmath83 and @xmath84 represent the massless particles and gapless energy spectrum .",
    "the main goldstone results can be formulated as follows @xmath85 the spontaneous breaking of the global gauge symmetry takes place due to the influence of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "they transform the initial field @xmath86 with two massive real components @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and a degenerate ground state with the minima forming a ring into another field with one massive and other massless components , the ground state of which has a well defined phase without initial symmetry .",
    "the elementary excitations above the new ground state changing the value @xmath89 are massive .",
    "it costs energy to displace @xmath82 against the restoring forces of the potential @xmath90 .",
    "but there are no restoring forces corresponding to displacements along the circular valley @xmath91 formed by initial degenerate vacuums .",
    "hence , for angular excitations @xmath84of wavelength , @xmath54 we have @xmath92 as @xmath93 .",
    "the dispersion law is @xmath94 and the particles are massless [ 7 ] .",
    "the @xmath84 particles are known as the goldstone bosons .",
    "this phenomenon is general and takes place in any order of perturbation theory .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry not only of the type as a global gauge symmetry but also of the type of rotational symmetry entails the existence of massless particles referred to as goldstone particles or nambu - golstone gapless modes .",
    "this statement is known as goldstone theorem .",
    "it establishes that there exists a gapless excitation mode when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the angular excitations @xmath84 are analogous to the spin waves .",
    "the latter represent a slow spatial variation of the direction of magnetization without changing of its absolute value .",
    "since the forces in a ferromagnetic are of short range , it requires a very little energy to excite this ground state .",
    "so , the frequency of the spin waves has the dispersion law @xmath95 .",
    "as was mentioned by ryder [ 7 ] , this argument breaks down if there are long - range forces like , for example , the @xmath96 coulomb force . in this case",
    ", we deal with the maxwellian gauge field with local depending on @xmath22 gauge symmetry instead of global gauge symmetry considered above .    after the specific application of the above statement",
    "will be demonstrated following refs .",
    "[ 10 - 16 ] , where the spinor bose - einstein condensates were discussed , we will consider the case of goldstone field @xmath86 and of the maxwellian field with local gauge symmetry .",
    "the above formulated theorems can be illustrated using the specific example of the bose - einstein condensed sodium atoms @xmath97na in an optical - dipole trap following the investigations of murata , saito and ueda [ 10 ] on the one side and of uchino , kobayashi and ueda [ 11 ] on the other side .",

    "the description of the atomic bose gas in an optical - dipole trap is possible in the plane - wave representation due to the homogeneity and the translational symmetry of the system .",

    "the bose - einstein condensates were found to be long - lived .",
    "some arguments concerning the metastable long - lived states were formulated .",
    "the states may appear if the energy barriers exist , which prevent the system from direct evolving toward its ground states .",
    "if the thermal energy needed to overcome these barriers is not available , the metastable state may be long - lived and these events are commonly encountered . even the bose - einstein condensates in the dilute atomic gases can also be formed due to the metastability . moreover , in the gases with attractive interactions the bose - einstein condensates may be metastable against the collapse just due to the energy barriers [ 12 ] . bellow we will discuss the bogoliubov - type collective elementary excitations arising over the metastable long - lived ground states of the spinor - type bose - einstein condensates ( bec - tes ) following ref.[10 , 11 ] , so as to demonstrate the formation of the nambu - goldstone modes .",

    "taking into account that in many experimental situations the linear zeeman effect can be ignored and the quadratic zeeman effect term @xmath124 can be manipulated experimentally , in [ 11 ] both cases of positive and negative @xmath124 at @xmath125 were investigated for spin @xmath126 and spin @xmath127 bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",

    "the indirect excitons ( ixs ) formed from spatially separated electrons and holes have dipole moments oriented perpendicularly to the layers .",

    "we briefly recall the results obtained in refs .",
    "[ 142 , 143 ] .",
    "when analyzing the possibility of bec in a 2d system it should be noted that at @xmath649 condensation of a homogeneous 2d gas is impossible because of destruction of the condensate by thermal fluctuations [ 147 ] . in a 2d system @xmath650",
    "is constant and the integral @xmath651 would diverge at @xmath652 and @xmath653 because of the zero denominator at the lower integrating limit and therefore bec is impossible here .",
    "physically this fact means that the maximal occupation of free states @xmath654 is infinite .",
    "however , if in a 2d boson system , together with free excitons , there are present some discrete states ( localized states whose existence is caused by the appearance of fluctuations of the heterointerface potential [ 148 ] ) @xmath561 , @xmath655 etc , such that @xmath656 , the situation changes essentially . in this case under increasing number of bosons in the system the value of chemical potential can not be arbitrarily close to the @xmath657 value because of the @xmath658 requirement , so @xmath659 and , consequently , the integral @xmath18 has a finite value [ 149 ] : @xmath660 therefore , at the moment when n exceeds @xmath661 , localized states are occupied by a macroscopic number of particles : @xmath662 .",
    "this means that bec into localized states occurs in a limited space region . in this sense bec in a system of 2d bosons , having a discrete spectrum of energy together with a continuous one , resembles the experimentally discovered phenomenon of bec in atoms of alkali metals in space - limited traps produced by a magnetic field [ 150 ] .",
    "the obvious advantage of an ix in a dqw as a perspective system to reveal bec is the possibility of controlling effectively its radiative lifetime @xmath663 with the help of external effects .",
    "so , for example , an electric field vdc applied to a dqw in the direction of the growth axis of the structure causes an essential decrease of the overlap of wavefunctions of an electron and a hole in an ix in the z direction and , as a result , @xmath664 increases significantly ( by up to three orders of magnitude [ 145 ] ) .",
    "this allows a more effective cooling of the system to the bath temperature and , of equal importance , gives an opportunity to increase the concentration of the ix gas without increasing the pumping density .",
    "the latter circumstance plays an important role in the experiment since it allows us to decrease heating of the sample by phonons that are inevitably radiated at relaxation of photoexcited carriers and excitons .",
    "just this heating of the sample under investigation is often the main cause of the impossibility of reaching the critical temperature of the boson gas in experiments that use large optical pumping densities to create the critical density of bosons having very short lifetimes .",
    "convincing evidence of the bec effect would be an appropriate exciton distribution function over energies ( momenta ) obtained in an experiment .",
    "in general the exciton distribution function can be determined in experiment by the form of the phonon replica line in luminescence spectra , but in our study no phonon replica was observed .",
    "this was why in this paper the nonphonon luminescence line of space ixs was studied .",
    "however , since the intensity of exciton radiation is proportional to the occupation of radiative states by particles , it indirectly reflects the distribution function of excitons over the free and localized states , which both contribute to the formation of the inhomogeneously broadened ix line . due to this fact",
    "one can hope that studies of ix luminescence will reveal the bec effect predicted [ 149 ] for a system of 2d bosons which are distributed over the free and localized states .",

    "here , at @xmath672 ( figure ( a ) ) the radiation spectrum was close to that of the flat - band case and it consisted of two lines , dxw and dxn , corresponding to luminescence of direct excitons ( dxs ) from the wide and the narrow wells respectively . at nonzero vdc ( figures ( b)(e ) )",
    "an indirect regime was achieved ( see the inset ) when the ix line took the lowest energetic position in the pl spectra .",
    "when vdc increased the ix line moved monotonically towards lower energies .",
    "it was noted that in some interval of @xmath669 a giant ( up to threefold ) increase ( shot ) of intensity of a part of the ix spectral line profile ( figure ( d ) ) ref .",
    "[ 142 ] occurred .",
    "a very important circumstance was that the intensity shot was absent from the whole investigated interval of spectral positions of the ix line at any temperature @xmath673 and optical pumping densities of @xmath674 .",
    "thus the spectral profile of the ix line corresponding to the case of figure ( d ) was shown on a large scale in the figure 3 of ref .",
    "[ 142 ] and it is reproduced here in fig.4 .",
    "it has some interesting peculiarities consisting of a narrow intense line c and of ` wings ' w having significantly smaller intensity .",
    "measurements of the temporal evolution of intensities of the c and w components have shown that the intensity of c , in contrast to that of w , fluctuated in time ( changing threefold ) on a characteristic scale of tens of seconds .",
    "the shape of the ix luminescence line in a dqw was inhomogeneous and was determined by exciton radiation from different space regions of the dqws plane , which differed from one another by the thickness of the qw layers , by fluctuations of barrier composition and by the value of the local electric field of impurities .",
    "the emission intensity of each spectral fragment of the ix line was proportional to the exciton occupation of the corresponding space region in the plane of the qw .",
    "however , a spectral region ( @xmath669 ) where the situation changes essentially at @xmath675 and @xmath671 appeared . in this region ,",
    "shown in figure 3 ( d ) a significant ( threefold ) increase of luminescence intensity of a part of the spectral profile of the ix line and a consequent increase ( 1.5-fold ) of integral intensity @xmath676 had been observed .",
    "such a behavior was anomalous in comparison to the monotonic decrease of @xmath676 ( and , most important , to the absence of the intensity shot ) with increasing @xmath669 under other experimental conditions ( at @xmath670 and @xmath677 ; @xmath678 and any @xmath674 as well ) . this anomalous behavior of the ix line",
    "indicated that in the case of figure 1 ( d ) of ref .",
    "[ 142 ] there are much more particles participating in radiation ( occupying states which can radiate ) than in the cases of figures 1 ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) of ref . [ 142 ] .    to explain this the bec model developed for 2d systems [ 149 ] was proposed .",
    "it was shown that if in a system of bosons ( excitons ) there is a localized state @xmath476 below the bottom of the exciton band , the chemical potential of excitons is trapped by the localized level @xmath679 and , as a consequence , the number @xmath680 of particles appears to be finite .",
    "therefore just when the concentration n of excitons in the system under consideration exceeds @xmath680 , a macroscopic number @xmath681 of particles comes to the lowest energetic state of the whole boson system ( i.e. free zone and the localized state ) and that leads to the appearance of a condensate .",
    "the phenomenon of a giant intensity shot was revealed in an experiment when the ix line shifted to lower energies ( that means changing @xmath682 ) , this being a consequence of an increase of the radiative lifetime of excitons due both to an increase of the exciton concentration ( at constant optical pumping ) and to their effective thermalization to the bath temperature .",
    "these two circumstances according to the authors opinion cause the bec that leaded to a huge population of a localized state.since , as noted above , all localized excitons take part in radiative recombination , this resulted in a significant change of the shape of the ix luminescence line from the case of figure ( c ) to that of figure ( d ) .",
    "thus the totality of the experimental data describing the evolution of the ix luminescence line ( namely , a giant rise of intensity of a part of the spectral profile of the ix line followed by long - time oscillations ) in the authors opinion provided evidence that in a system of ixs of high density a bose ",
    "einstein condensate at localized states ( traps ) in dqws appeared .",
    "thermal equilibrium of this type of excitons in a trap has been demonstrated experimentally [ 102 , 103 ] .    as was appreciated in the ref . [ 102 , 103 ] up to now there has not been an universally accepted demonstration of bec in this type of systems and is necessary a better understanding of the many - body effects of the interacting dipole ixs .",
    "but the accumulated knowledge permits to formulate some conclusions . one of them states that the confinement of the excitons in a trap analogous to the optical traps for the cold atoms is a great advantage instead of creating excitons with a laser allowing them to expand freely out of the excitation region .",
    "recent work [ 117 ] showed that the ixs in dqws reach equilibrium both energetically and spatially in a stress induced trap .",
    "one variant of the bec of excitons equivalent to the bec in a trap was proposed by jan and lee [ 149 ] and was used in ref .",
    "[ 142 , 143 ] .",
    "another conclusion formulated in ref .",
    "103 ] concerns the role of the temperature . if the temperature is low compared to the energy fluctuation due to the disorder then the excitons will become trapped in low energy minima of the disorder potential and will not act as a free gas .",
    "such energy minima can localize only one or a small number of ixs because they are repealing each other due to the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "in difference on it in the trap there are localized levels able to accommodate a macroscopic number of ixs .",
    "a strong energy shift due to interactions may cancel out the trapping potential and may flatten it [ 121 ] .",
    "another important conclusion of refs .",
    "[ 102 , 103 ] is based on the results by laikhtman and rapaport [ 151 ] who underlined that the dipole ixs in a coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) no longer act as a gas but rather as a correlated liquid .",
    "this does not mean that bec is impossible at high density .",
    "but the canonical telltale for condensation in a weakly interacting bose gas , namely a peak of occupation number at @xmath477 may not be easily seen in these systems .",
    "it would be better to look for hydrodynamic effects of condensation of excitons such as quantum vortices or superfluidity similar to the liquid helium .",
    "as one can see the most eminent achievements discussed in the review article concern the famous fqhes discovered in the frame of the one - component 2deg .",
    "they suggest to search similar phenomena in the frame of the two - component , 2d e - h systems , when the cps will be formed by electrons and holes with attached point vortices in different combinations taking into account the interactions inside the cps from one side and the coulomb interaction between the electrons and holes forming the usual magnetoexcitons from the other side . in spite of the fact that the supplementary gauge magnetic fields created by electrons and holes with opposite charges will be compensated in the mean field approximation , nevertheless the new electron quantum states will appear as elementary excitations and quantum fluctuations in these new conditions .",
    "the purpose of the present review is to discuss the phenomena related to the spontaneous breaking due to the quantum fluctuations of the continuous symmetries existing in the frame of the two - dimensional e - h systems in a strong perpendicular magnetic field with electrons and holes lying on the lowest landau levels .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to the formation of the new ground states and phase transitions and determines the energy spectra of the collective elementary excitations appearing over the new ground states .",
    "the main attention is given to the electron - hole systems forming the coplanar magnetoexcitons in the bose - einstein condensation ground state with wave vector @xmath0 under the influence of the excited landau levels when the exciton - type excitations coexist with the plasmon - type oscillations .",
    "at the same time the properties of the 2deg under the conditions of the fqhe as well as of the similar 2dhg spatially separated on the layers of the dqw are taken into account , so as to foresee their possible influence on the states of the coplanar magnetoexcitons when the distance between the dqw layers diminishes .",
    "side by side with the 2deg and 2dhg a bilayer electron systems in the conditions of the fqhe with one half filling factor of llls in each layer and with the total filling factor of two layers equal to unity are taken into account because the coherent superposition of the electron states in two layers happens to be equivalent with the formation of the qhexs in the coherent macroscopical state , which can be compared with the bec of the coplanar magnetoexcitons .",
    "the breaking of the global gauge symmetry as well as of the continuous rotational symmetries leads to the formation of the gapless nambu - goldstone modes of the collective excitations above the selected ground state , corresponding to the macroscopical wave function with a fixed phase , whereas the breaking of the local gauge symmetry gives rise to the higgs phenomenon characterized by the gapped branches of the energy spectrum of the collective elementary excitations .",
    "the existence of the gapless and gapped branches of the energy spectrum is equivalent to the appearance of the massless and massive particles correspondingly in the relativistic physics .",
    "application of the nielsen - chadha theorem establishing the relation between the number of the ng modes and the number of the broken symmetry operators as well as the elucidation of the conditions when the quasi - ng modes appear was effectuated on the concrete example of the spinor atoms in the state of bec in an optical trap with the aim to better understand the results concerning the coplanar magnetoexcitons .",
    "the higgs phenomenon gives rise to the formation of the composite particles in the frame of the 2deg in conditions of the fqhe , so that the electron with an odd or even number of the attached point vortices behaves as an composite boson or fermion correspondingly .",
    "their description in the frame of the ginzburg - landau theory is demonstrated .",
    "side by side with the 2d coplanar magnetoexcitons the conditions under which the spontaneous coherence may appear in the system of indirect excitations in the double quantum well structures with spatially separated electrons and holes were discussed .",
    "the experimental attempts to achieve the bec of ixs in the traps arising due to the interface width fluctuations or due to the applied stress were reviewed , the concluding remarks and the recommendations are mentioned .",
    "the formation of the high density 2d magnetoexcitons and magnetoexciton - polaritons with point quantum vortices attached is suggested .",

    "<S> the spontaneous breaking of the continuous symmetries of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron - hole systems in a strong perpendicular magnetic field leads to the formation of new ground states and determines the energy spectra of the collective elementary excitations appearing over these ground states . in this review </S>",
    "<S> the main attention is given to the electron - hole systems forming coplanar magnetoexcitons in the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) ground state with the wave vector @xmath0 , taking into account the excited landau levels , when the exciton - type elementary excitations coexist with the plasmon - type oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time properties of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) spatially separated as in the case of double quantum wells ( dqws ) from the 2d hole gas under conditions of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) are of great interest because they can influence the quantum states of the coplanar magnetoexcitons when the distance between the dqw layers diminishes . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider in this review the bilayer electron systems under conditions of the fqhe with the one half filling factor for each layer and with the total filling factor for two layers equal to unity because the coherence between the electron states in two layers is equivalent to the formation of the quantum hall excitons ( qhexs ) in a coherent macroscopic state . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to compare the energy spectrum of the collective elementary excitations of the bose - einstein condensed qhexs and coplanar magnetoexcitons . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of the global gauge symmetry as well as of the continuous rotational symmetries leads to the formation of the gapless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes while the breaking of the local gauge symmetry gives rise to the higgs phenomenon characterized by the gapped branches of the energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena are equivalent to the emergence of massless and of massive particles , correspondingly , in the relativistic physics . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the nielsen - chadha theorem establishing the number of the ng modes depending of the number of the broken symmetry operators and the elucidation when the quasi - ng modes appear are demonstrated using as an example related with the bec of spinor atoms in an optical trap . </S>",
    "<S> they have the final aim to better understand the results obtained in the case of the coplanar bose - einstein condensed magnetoexcitons . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs phenomenon results in the emergence of the composite particles under the conditions of the fqhe . </S>",
    "<S> their description in terms of the ginzburg - landau theory is remembered . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of the high density 2d magnetoexcitons and magnetoexciton - polaritons with point quantum vortices attached is suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions in which the spontaneous coherence could appear in a system of indirect excitons in a double quantum well structures are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental attempts to achieve these conditions , the main results and the accumulated knowledge are reviewed . </S>"
