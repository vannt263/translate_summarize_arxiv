    "figure  [ diag2 ] shows that the spectral type of star a is near b0.5 on the basis the ew(hei @xmath135876 ) measurement ( _ upper panel _ ) and nearer b3 on the basis of the ew(h@xmath11)/ew(hei @xmath135876 ) measurement ( _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are few spectral diagnostics sensitive to temperature for early b stars in the spectral range available . traditional spectral type diagnostics in the blue end of the optical regime are not helpful in our spectra because of low s / n  a consequence of reduced instrumental sensitivity and high interstellar reddening which suppresses the blue flux from star a. we adopt a spectral type of b1.5@xmath61.0 .",
    "h or he emission lines , often seen in b supergiants , are not evident in our spectrum of star a. furthermore , the h@xmath11 and h@xmath14 linewidths in star a are 1518fwhm more typical of dwarfs and much broader than the balmer lines in any of our comparison b giants .",

    "the red colors in any two bandpasses suggest a high degree of reddening for an early b star which has close to zero intrinsic color .",

    "* ) , and @xmath21=5.6 mag of reddening according to a @xcite extinction curve in the optical and near - infrared and an @xcite reddening law in the mid - infrared .",
    "the data are well fit by the model for a distance of @xmath94.0 kpc .",
    "the fit is quite good in the infrared where the photometry is most accurate and less good in the optical regime where photomteric uncertainties are considerable .",
    "nevertheless , the sed constrains the extinction with within about @xmath22 .",
    "no infrared excess is apparent , as might be expected for evolved massive stars having free - free emission or stars hosting circumstellar material .",
    "this is consistent with our adoption of a dwarf ( i.e. , main sequence ) luminosity class .",
    "based on the fit in figure  [ sed ] , we adopt a distance of 4.0@xmath61 kpc to star a and the bowshock nebula , where the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of the star s spectral type and intrinsic luminosity . at this distance 1",
    "corresponds to 0.019 pc and the @xmath92  angular diameter of the bowshock nebula corresponds to 2.3 pc .",
    "this also means that the 7  angular distance from star a to the bowshock apsis translates to a linear distance of @xmath230.13 pc , where the inequality accounts for the unknown inclination relative to the line of sight .",
    "given that bowshock nebulae are most easily recognized when seen edge - on , the inclination is likely to be near 90  and the standoff distance , @xmath24 pc , similar to bowshocks from stars # 2 and # 5 in the @xcite study of cygnus  ob2 .",
    "we examined the @xmath25co  velocity cube of the iras  03063 + 5735 region from the canadian galactic plane survey @xcite .",

    "contours show the @xmath25co  intensity integrated over the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath2  km  s@xmath3  velocity channels .",
    "the @xmath25co  contours correspond to intensities of 5 through 35 k km  s@xmath3  in steps of 5  k , equivalent to h@xmath28 column densities of 1.5 through 10.5 @xmath29 @xmath30 adopting a standard conversion factor of @xmath11=3.0@xmath31 @xmath30 ( k km  s@xmath3)@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "note that the location of the bowshock nebula coincides with a local maximum in the h@xmath28 column density of approximately 4.5 @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "if we estimate that this feature is a roughly spherical molecular cloud with radius @xmath32  @xmath33 1.10 pc , then the implied number density is @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "we caution that this is only a gross average , as @xmath25co  is known to freeze out onto dust grains in the cold dense cloud interiors .",
    "the similarity of the @xmath25co  and diffuse ism morphology , along with the identification of a local @xmath25co  peak at the bowshock location , supports the association of the bowshock with the molecular complex .",

    "this lends further support to the association of the bowshock with this particular molecular complex . in principle",
    ", one might expect a runaway star to show anomalously large velocities relative to the surrounding medium .",
    "however , given the clear bowshock morphology of the associated nebula , we would also expect such objects to have velocity vectors predominantly in the plane of the sky .",
    "hence , the similarity between the radial velocity of star a and the molecular cloud upon which it impinges is consistent with the observed geometry .    the @xcite rotation curve in the outer galaxy shows that radial velocity is not a very precise distance indicator along this @xmath37140  sightline .",
    "their figure  2b shows gas at @xmath38 km  s@xmath3  associated with a wide range of distances from 2 to 6 kpc . our spectrophotometric distance estimate to star  a of 4.0@xmath61 kpc links the molecular gas at @xmath27  km  s@xmath3  to a distance comfortably within that range .",

    "@xcite searched for but did not detect any oh or water masters from this infrared source .",
    "as first demonstrated by @xcite the observed flux density of radio emission at frequency @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) from an optically - thin , isothermal , region at a known distance can be related to the h - ionizing photon flux ( @xmath41 ) from the exciting ob star(s ) . in this study",
    "we will use values of @xmath41 tabulated from model atmospheres of ob stars to determine if an region surrounding an early b - type star should be visible in our radio continuum images .",
    "@xcite present a version of the@xcite formula for observations at 1420 mhz of an isothermal ( 7500 k ) region containing only hydrogen . using the stellar calibration of @xcite",
    "we find a b1.5  v star has @xmath42 which corresponds to f@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the distance in kpc and @xmath45 is essentially a covering factor ( ie . , @xmath46 would correspond to an ionization bounded region , @xmath47 could apply to a blister - type region ) . for @xmath46 and @xmath48",
    "we find f@xmath49 mjy .",
    "this corresponds to a source with @xmath50  k in the cgps ignoring any beam dilution .",
    "the average and standard deviation of brightness temperature of our 1420 mhz image in a 10x10 arcmin box surrounding the position of the bowshock is @xmath51  k so the distance and spectral type are consistent with the non - detection of this object in the cgps radio contiuum images .",
    "the non - detection in the cgps image actually puts a fairly strong limit on how early the star could be .",
    "for example , at o9  v @xmath52 , and repeating the above calculation leads to @xmath53  k. even with a very low value for @xmath45 the region associated with a late o type star would be easily detectable .",
    "all of this is consistant with our non - detection of the @xmath134511 line in the optical spectrum which shows that star a is b0.5  v or later .",

    "the star is detected in the _ wise _ w1 and w2 bands , so we have used the higher - resolution _ sst _  glimpse photometry to subtract off the star s contribution to the _ wise _ w1 and w2 measurements .",

    "the dashed line shows a @xcite dust model fit by eye for a radiation field @xmath54 times the average interstellar radiation field of 2.17@xmath55 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath30 @xcite , a pah fractional contribution of 1.77% and a mean ism number density of 600   @xmath35 .",
    "the _ wise _ w2 [ 4.5 ] datum lies well above the model , possibly because of a contribution from shocked molecular hydrogen in this band .",
    "the _ iras _ 60 and 100 @xmath8 m data also show relatively poor agreement with the model , but the uncertainties on these data are large owing to the large ( 4 ) beamsize and background subtraction complications .",
    "the diffuse infrared surface brightness varies substantially over the nebula , suggesting substantial spatial variations in the local dust and gas density .",
    "variations in temperature and density throughout the nebula are certain to render the single averaged sed a gross oversimplification . hence , the dotted line fit is mostly for illustrative purposes , especially given large uncertainties on the local number density in the vicinity of the bowshock .",
    "the apparent increase in stellar density just to the north - east of the star a initially suggested the possibility of a stellar cluster at this location .",
    "however , a color - magnitude diagram using jhk photometry of 2mass catalog sources within a 1  radius shows that the stars have a considerable spread in color ( hence , reddening ) , and no clustering in either color - color or color - magnitude diagrams is evident .",
    "therefore , we find no evidence of a stellar cluster in this vicinity , at least to the depths probed by the 2mass and glimpse catalog data .",
    "the expected proper motion of an object at 4.0 kpc distance with a transverse motion of 30 km  s@xmath3  is @xmath91 mas yr@xmath3 , too small to have a measured proper motion even over decade time scales in multi - epoch photographic plate surveys .",
    "indeed , the usno - b1.0 catalog does not report a proper motion .",
    "hence , there is no direct evidence for star a having a high space velocity .",
    "rather , it is inferred as a possibility from the morphology of the nebula .",
    "it is also possible that low - velocity stars moving in a medium with a density gradient @xcite can produce a bowshock - like nebula .",
    "the proximity of star a to a molecular cloud having a maximum column density just ahead of the bowshock ( see figure  [ comap ] ) makes this explanation worth considering .",
    "perhaps star a formed within or near the pictured molecular complex .",
    "however , formation of such a massive star typically requires relatively high column densities characteristic of massive molecular clouds and would be accompanied by the formation of other lower mass stars comprising a small embedded cluster .",
    "we find no evidence of either high column density molecular clouds ( the highest is 10.5@xmath29 @xmath30  at 85@xmath331.6 pc north of the bowshock ) or a stellar cluster containing lower mass stars .",
    "furthermore , the observed excess emission in the [ 4.5 ] band ( figure  [ bssed ] ) would be well explained by emission from shocked @xmath56 if the nebula were a genuine shock .",
    "it is not clear whether a low - velocity b1.5 star carving a cavity within a local density gradient would generate a wind shock sufficient to produce excitation of @xmath56 .",
    "more detailed spectral information and shock modeling would be needed to determine if this is a possibility .",
    "given the current data , we prefer the interpretation that star  a is encountering the molecular cloud for the first time after having traveled some distance from its point of formation at a high velocity .",
    "the orientation of the cometary bowshock nebula suggests that star a s direction of travel is roughly toward the equatorial north .",
    "we searched the simbad database for young stars , star clusters , and  regions up to 3 degrees to the south to identify candidate birthplaces of star a. at a distance of 4.0 kpc and an assumed tangential velocity of 30 km  s@xmath3  ( 30 pc myr@xmath3 ) in the plane of the sky , it would be reasonable to suppose that the star has traversed up to 600 pc ( 8on the sky ) or even more during its few@xmath1210 myr main - sequence lifetime . however , given that the star is already below the plane and moving toward galactic north , adopting the maximum travel time allowed by the main - sequence lifetime implies a formation locale well outside the scale height of milky way molecular clouds required to form such a massive star . therefore , we prefer the interpretation that the runaway has been ejected recently and confine our search within several degrees of its current location .",
    "one likely candidate for star a s birthplace is the  region and stellar cluster associated with iras  03064 + 5638 located 0.94(64 pc ) due south .",
    "figure  [ wide ] shows a three - color image of the field around star a with the cgps 1420  mhz radio continuum in red , the _ wise _ [ 11.1 ] in green , and the _ wise _ [ 4.5 ] in blue .",

    "the bright ridge of radio emission extending 2  north to south is a thermal radio filament at an unknown distance and powered by a yet - unidentified source @xcite . both the bowshock nebula iras  03063 + 5735 and iras  03064 + 5638 have @xmath25co  peaks in this velocity range , suggesting a common distance .",
    "iras  03064 + 5638 contains a stellar cluster characterized by @xcite as having a few mid - b type stellar members , for their adopted distance of 2.2 kpc .",

    "apparently , the iras  03064 + 5638 cluster contains at least one star more massive than star a , making it an environment from which star a could plausibly have been ejected .",
    "three - body encounters which eject one star often result in the formation of a tight binary .",
    "therefore , our working scenario predicts the existence of close early - b binary within iras  03064 + 5638 .",
    "however , the extinction appears high at this location , and no suitably bright optical sources are visible .",
    "the peak molecular column density at iras  03064 + 5638 is approximately @xmath60=4.5@xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "the adjoining molecular clouds which lack bright ir emission have peak @xmath60 almost twice this value , suggesting other possible sites of intermediate - mass star formation nearby .",
    "these , yet unidentified , sites of star formation could have also been the birthplace of star a.    another possible origin for star a is the open cluster ngc  1220 , located a full 3  ( @xmath9201 pc ) to the south of star a , but along the same vector pictured in figure  [ wide ] .",
    "@xcite identified 26 probable members of this open cluster , estimating a distance of 1800@xmath6200 pc and an age of 60  myr . while this denser and more populous cluster provides a suitable environment for ejecting a b star via n - body encounters , the much smaller heliocentric distance ( if correct ) makes a physical connection between ngc  1220 and iras  03063 + 5735/star",
    "a less likely .",
    "we have identified an _ iras _ infrared source iras  03063 + 5735 , previously reported as a galaxy , to be a bowshock nebula powered an early b - type ( b1.5 v ) star .",
