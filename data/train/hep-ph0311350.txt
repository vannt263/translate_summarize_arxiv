    "( [ h1 ] ) , ( [ h2 ] ) are valid to describe the manifold semileptonic decays such as @xmath690 and so on ( see , for instance , @xcite in addition to @xcite ) . the eqs .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) , ( [ h2 ] ) might although be pertinent to treat the transitions caused by the pure axial ( @xmath691 ) hadronic current , such as @xmath692 , or by the pure vector current ( @xmath693 ) , such as the super - allowed @xmath694 nuclear transitions .",
    "but all the aforesaid is not our case , it is not relevant for describing the neutron @xmath0decay .",
    "evidently , as the total amplitude @xmath59 ( [ i5 ] ) is not multiple to @xmath662 ( [ i7 ] ) , the distribution ( [ i34 ] ) can never be transformed to an expression multiple to ( [ i33 ] ) , unlike the results asserted in several calculations @xcite which were entailed by the original work @xcite where the decay probability was reduced , to all intents and purposes , to the  model - independent \" part merely proportional to @xmath695 ( [ i33 ] ) , that is explicitly not our case .",
    "the original investigation @xcite had been undertaken before the standard model of elementary particle physics was brought to completion in the nowaday form @xcite .",
    "then , for the lack of the renormalizable electroweak weinberg - salam theory , there was seen no way to treat the neutron @xmath0decay with self - contained allowance for the radiative corrections .",
    "the purpose of the ingenious work @xcite was to circumvent the problem of uv divergence and sidestep the consideration of the electromagnetic corrections in the uv region , by appropriate separating the whole electromagnetic corrections of order @xmath44 into two conceivable parts , a  model - independent \" ( mi ) and a  model - dependent \" ( md ) , of different purports . the first one , mi ,",
    "was chosen and sorted out so that it should evidently be uv - finite and could merely be obtained by multiplying the uncorrected ( born ) decay probability @xmath676 ( [ i33 ] ) by a single universal function @xmath696 , see eqs .",
    "( 20 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was calculated within the effective 4-fermion - interaction approach ( [ 1])-([l ] ) , without taking into consideration the electroweak and strong interactions as prescribed by the standard model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this mi part was presumed to describe the electromagnetic effects on the neutron @xmath0decay .",
    "all the left - over radiative corrections were conceived to be incorporated into the second , md part , assuming the electroweak and strong interactions conspire somehow to give the finite corrections to the quantities @xmath697 which reside in the uncorrected , born decay probability ( [ i33 ] ) , see eqs .",
    "( 19 ) , ( 20 ) in ref .",
    "thus , in all the calculations , such as @xcite , presuming the approach launched by the work @xcite , the corrected decay probability merely shows up to be reduced to the uncorrected one multiplied by the function @xmath696 , with the whole effect of the remained md part absorbed into the quantities @xmath698 which thereby would get the new values @xmath699 instead of the original ones : the @xmath8 matrix element @xmath7 in ( [ l5 ] ) and the amplitudes @xmath700 specifying the nucleon weak transition current ( [ i8 ] ) , ( [ j0 ] ) .",
    "thus , the experimental data would be described in terms of these  new \" quantities @xmath699 .",
    "however , any explicit and definite , quantitative one - to - one correspondence between these two sets of parameters , @xmath701 and @xmath702 , would never be asserted in refs .",
    "yet the guide tenet is to ascertain , as precise as possible , the very genuine values of @xmath703 from experimental data processing . in particular",
    ", we are in need of the stringent @xmath26 value in order to verify strictly the validity of the @xmath8 identity ( [ ckm ] ) @xcite .",
    "so , the aforesaid calculations @xcite making use of the very handy , but rather untenable simplifications can not be said to be eligible for now , in so far as an accuracy @xmath704 or even better goes .    in our treatment , the amplitude @xmath59 ( [ i5 ] ) , ( [ mm ] ) and , subsequently , the distribution @xmath677 ( [ i34 ] ) comprise all the @xmath512order radiative corrections , without disparting the coulomb term and separating the mi and the md parts . adopting @xmath705 and taking all the input parameters in ( [ i34 ] ) from ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the corrections ( [ dw ] ) and ( [ da ] ) @xmath706 to the uncorrected @xmath707 and @xmath647 values . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the correction @xmath708 ( [ da ] ) , ( [ dwa ] ) is independent of @xmath709 .",
    "apparently , our results ( [ dwa ] ) pronouncedly differ from the respective mi - values @xmath710 asserted in refs .",
    "consequently , the values of @xmath711 and @xmath712 ascertained from experimental data processing with utilizing @xmath713 , @xmath714 ( [ mi ] ) will alter , when they are obtained with @xmath650 , @xmath708 ( [ dwa ] ) .",
    "the modifications are of the noticeable magnitude : @xmath715 , @xmath716 .",
    "for instance , the values @xmath717 given in @xcite will be modified to @xmath718 is used .",
    "now we are to discuss what is the precision attainable in the actual calculations nowadays , a pivotal question that matters a lot .    as from the first we have been calculating the radiative corrections in the one - loop order , @xmath177 , the relative uncertainty @xmath719 resides in the evaluated radiative corrections ( [ dwa ] ) , from the very beginning .",
    "we further recall that the terms of relative order @xmath720 and smaller have been neglected far and wide , with a relative error @xmath721 entrained thereby .",
    "yet a far more substantial task than the aforesaid ones is to inquire into the ambiguities caused by entanglement of the strong quark - quark interactions in the neutron @xmath722-decay .    the final result ( [ i34 ] ) involves the matching parameter @xmath723 posited to treat separately quark systems with large , @xmath364 , and comparatively small , @xmath407 , momenta .",
    "the dependence of the results @xmath724 ( [ dwa ] ) on the @xmath202 value shows up to be very faint : we have got @xmath725 at @xmath726 and @xmath727 at @xmath728 , and @xmath708 is practically independent of @xmath202 at all .",
    "so , the uncertainties because of the @xmath202 involvement in ( [ i34 ] ) are about @xmath72 in @xmath650 and practically zero in @xmath708 ( [ dwa ] ) .",
    "further , @xmath202 is chosen so that @xmath729 , and we took for granted the generally accepted standpoint of the standard model that the strong quark - quark interactions die out when a quark system possesses momenta @xmath730 . at relatively small momenta @xmath407 ,",
    "a quark system was considered to form various baryonic states , including the nucleon .",
    "let us recall all the actual calculations have been carried out assuming eqs.([j0])-([g0 ] ) and retaining only the single nucleon intermediate state ( [ gn ] ) in the expressions ( [ j18 ] ) , ( [ j19 ] ) , ( [ j20 ] ) , ( [ j29 ] ) , what counts is the final result ( [ i34 ] ) , ( [ dwa ] ) . in calculating the radiative corrections , we did not intend to allow for nucleon compositeness rigorously , but ( in sections @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) we only tried and estimated how those basic calculations alter when including the nucleon excited states ( [ gb ] ) and the form factors ( [ i8 ] ) , ( [ a])-([ff ] ) into the expressions ( [ j18 ] ) , ( [ j20 ] ) , ( [ j29 ] ) . as was found out in sections @xmath76 and @xmath77 ,",
    "the different terms in the amplitude @xmath43 ( [ i5 ] ) , ( [ mm ] ) ( and subsequently in the distribution @xmath677 ( [ i34 ] ) ) are affected by allowance for compositeness of the nucleon to a different extent . as a matter of fact , there is no modification in the first , prevailing term in ( [ 0 ] ) which is determined by the integral @xmath731 ( [ 1ij ] ) .",
    "it includes , in particular , the coulomb correction .",
    "the direct evaluation shows that this major term causes the share of about @xmath732 in the whole correction @xmath733 ( [ dwa ] ) .",
    "all the other left - over terms in the decay amplitude @xmath43 provide the remnant portion @xmath734 of @xmath650 and the whole value @xmath735 ( [ dwa ] ) .",
    "the effect of nucleon compositeness on these terms was estimated ( in sections @xmath74 , @xmath77 ) to constitute no more than @xmath438 to their whole value . for",
    "now , there sees no real reliable way to calculate precisely these corrections - to - corrections in treating the neutron @xmath0decay . with the ascertained estimations ,",
    "they are abandoned in the actual calculation which has provided ( [ i34 ] ) , ( [ dwa ] ) .",
    "consequently , in respect of all the aforesaid , the uncertainties in the result ( [ dwa ] ) prove to make up no more than @xmath736    thus , our inferences are realized to hold true up to the accuracy about a few tenth of per cents , never worse .",
    "if anything , let us behold the energy released in the @xmath0decay of free neutrons is rather negligible as compared to the nucleon mass , @xmath737 , whereas the energy released in manifold semileptonic decays is comparable to the masses of the hadrons involved in the process , or even greater than they .",
    "that is why accounting for compositeness of the hadron proves to play no decisive role in the neutron @xmath0decay , but can be of significant value in other semileptonic decays ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in the current treatment of the radiative corrections to the neutron @xmath0decay",
    ", we have actually allowed for the effects of nucleon structure by introducing only one fit - parameter @xmath284 to be specified , simultaneously with the fundamental quantity @xmath26 , by processing the experimental data on the lifetime @xcite and electron momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "evidently , the ambiguities ( [ ddwa ] ) put bounds on the accuracy which can be attained in obtaining the @xmath738 values thereby .",
    "thus , introducing only the usual parameters @xmath739 to describe the weak nucleon transition current does not suffice to parameterize the whole effect of strong interactions in treating the neutron @xmath10decay with allowance for the radiative corrections , in so far as the accuracy one per cent or better goes .",
    "nowadays , no way is thought to get rid of the errors ( [ ddwa ] ) , but to parameterize ingeniously the effects of nucleon compositeness by expedient introducing some additional fit - parameters ( besides @xmath284 ) to describe the radiative corrections to various characteristics of the neutron @xmath0decay .",
    "these additional parameters are to be fixed by processing , simultaneously with the results of measurements of @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite , the experimental data obtained in the additional experiments , such as proposed in @xcite and other in this line . for instance , these extra parameters might be conceived to render generically the  effective \" mass in the intermediate state in ( [ j18 ] ) , ( [ j19 ] ) , ( [ j20 ] ) , ( [ j29 ] ) , ( [ dm5 ] ) and the  effective \" vertices ( [ j1b ] ) , ( [ i8 ] ) , ( [ j2b])-([a1 ] ) .",
    "they are to be fixed , together with @xmath740 , from the simultaneous analysis of all the available experimental data , the kinematic corrections @xcite respected as well .",
    "so we are in need of the manifold tenable experiments to measure various characteristics of the neutron @xmath0decay , besides @xmath12 and @xmath4 , with an accuracy about @xmath72 , and even better .",
    "obtained such high - precision experimental data , the high accuracy , better than @xmath6 , is believed to be attained within the unified self - contained analysis of the different experimental data amenably to the standard model .",
