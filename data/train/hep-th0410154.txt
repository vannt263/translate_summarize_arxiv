    "according to the so called `` no - hair '' conjecture , a stationary black hole is uniquely described in terms of a small set of asymptotically measurable quantities .",
    "this hypothesis was disproved more than ten years ago , when several authors presented a counterexample within the framework of su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory @xcite .",
    "although the new solution was static with vanishing yang - mills ( ym ) charges , it was different from the schwarzschild black hole and , therefore , not characterized by its total mass ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of this topic and an extensive bibliography ) .",
    "however , much on the literature on hairy black hole solutions is restricted to the case of an asymptotically flat spacetime . since",
    "asymptotic flatness is not always an appropriate theoretical idealisation , and is never satisfied in reality , it may be important to consider other types of asymptotics , in particular solutions with a cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) black hole solutions with su(2 ) nonabelian fields have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the properties of these configurations are strikingly different from those valid in the asymptotically flat case ( for example there are stable solutions in which the gauge field has no nodes ; also solutions exist for continuous intervals of the parameter space , rather than discrete points ) . in an unexpected development",
    ", it has been shown recently that for @xmath7 even a conformally coupled scalar field can be painted as hair @xcite .    much of the discussion on ads hairy black holes has concerned the case when the matter fields fall off sufficiently fast such that the conserved charges can be written as surface integrals involving only the metric and its derivatives . however , recently it became clear that the usual ads - invariant boundary conditions do not include all aads configurations .",
    "several solutions involving a minimally coupled self - interacting scalar field in the bulk action and preserving the asymptotic ads symmetry group despite the fact that the standard gravitational mass diverges , have appeared in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an exact four - dimensional black hole solution of gravity with a minimally coupled self - interacting scalar field has been presented in @xcite by martinez , troncoso and zanelli ( mtz ) .",
    "hairy black hole solutions of @xmath8 gauged supergravity in four and five dimensions are described in ref .",
    "solutions describing a gravitating self - interacting scalar field whose mass saturates the breitenlohner - freedman bound are discussed in @xcite .    in all these cases ,",
    "the scalar fields drop off so slowly in the asymptotic region , such that they add a nonzero contribution to the conserved charges .",
    "the mass of these solutions is computed by using an hamiltonian method , such that the divergencies from the gravity and scalar parts cancel out , yielding a finite total charge .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of einstein gravity coupled to a dilaton field @xmath9 with a dilaton potential @xmath10 , looking for solutions satisfying a weakened set of boundary conditions at infinity , which implies a diverging adm mass , despite the fact that the spacetime is still aads . to simplify the general picture",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath11 .",
    "also , since nonabelian fields usually occur together with the dilaton in the bosonic sector of many gauged supergravity theories , we include a su(2 ) nonabelian field in the action ( abelian solutions of this theory are discussed in @xcite , however for a particular set of boundary conditions which implies a finite adm mass ) . we suppose that the dilaton field approaches asymptotically a constant value @xmath12 , which corresponds to an extremum of the potential such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the configurations present an effective negative cosmological constant .    since a negative cosmological constant allows for the existence of black holes whose horizon has nontrivial topology , we consider apart from spherically symmetric solutions , topological black holes also .",
    "the mass of these solutions is computed by using a counterterm method .",
    "although we discuss a general case , assuming only the existence of a power series expansion at infinity , numerical results are presented mainly for the case of @xmath15 gauged supergravity model of gates and zwiebach @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we explain the model and derive the basic equations and the asymptotic form of the solutions .",
    "the boundary stress tensor and the associated conserved charge are computed in section 3 , by using a counterterm prescription adapted to our case .",
    "the counterterm choice is tested for the mtz black hole solution . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical results , the case of regular solutions being also briefly discussed .",
    "we conclude with section 5 where the results are compiled .",
    "we start with the following action principle @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , @xmath18 is the ricci scalar associated with the spacetime metric @xmath19 .",

    "the last term in ( [ action ] ) is the hawking - gibbons surface term @xcite , where @xmath26 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the induced metric of the boundary .",
    "the field equations are obtained by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the field variables @xmath29 and @xmath9 @xmath30&=&0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the energy - momentum tensor is defined by @xmath31 since for a negative cosmological constant topological black holes may appear ( whose topology of the event horizon is no longer the two - sphere @xmath32 ) , we consider a general metric ansatz @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the metric on a two - dimensional surface of constant curvature @xmath35 .",
    "the discrete parameter @xmath36 takes the values @xmath37 and @xmath38 and implies the form of the function @xmath39 @xmath40 when @xmath41 , the metric takes on the familiar spherically symmetric form , for @xmath42 the @xmath43 sector is a space with constant negative curvature , while for @xmath44 this is a flat surface ( see @xmath45 the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account the symmetries of the line element ( [ metric ] ) , we find the expression of the purely magnetic ym ansatz @xcite @xmath46 which gives the ym curvature @xmath47 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "inserting this ansatz into the action ( [ action ] ) , the field equations reduce to @xmath49      we assume that the solution of the above equations admits at large @xmath48 a power series expansion of the form @xmath50 from the lowest order term in equation of @xmath9 we find that @xmath51 ( we shall note @xmath52 ) .",
    "we remark that , by using a suitable redefinition , we can always set @xmath53 , with no loss of generality .",
    "the effective cosmological constant is @xmath54 the generic solution has @xmath55 , which , from the field equations , implies the following consistency conditions on the dilaton potential @xmath56 note that the scalar field mass @xmath57 is larger than the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xmath58 .",
    "the assumption ( [ asym1 ] ) leads to the asymptotic expansion at large @xmath48 @xmath59 where @xmath60 are arbitrary constants , which implies the asymptotic form of the metric function @xmath61 for any @xmath62 , this set of asymptotics preserve the full ads symmetry group .",
    "different from the asymptotically flat case , there are no obvious restrictions on the value of @xmath63 .",
    "in order to compute quantities like the action and mass one usually encounters infrared divergences , associated with the infinite volume of the spacetime manifold . the traditional approach to this problem is to use the a background subtraction whose asymptotic geometry matches that of the solutions .",
    "however , this approach breaks down when there is no appropriate or obvious background .    in the ads",
    "/ cft inspired counterterm method , this problem is solved by adding additional surface terms to the theory action .",
    "these counterterms are built up with curvature invariants of a boundary @xmath64 ( which is sent to infinity after the integration ) and thus obviously they do not alter the bulk equations of motion .",
    "this yields a well - defined boundary stress tensor and a finite action and mass of the system .    as found in @xcite ,",
    "the following counterterms are sufficient to cancel divergences in four dimensions , for vacuum solutions with a negative cosmological constant @xmath65 @xmath66\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the ricci scalar for the boundary metric @xmath28 .",
    "using these counterterms one can construct a divergence - free boundary stress tensor @xmath68 from the total action @xmath69 by defining @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the einstein tensor of the boundary metric , @xmath72 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath73 being an outward pointing normal vector to the boundary .",
    "if @xmath74 is a killing vector generating an isometry of the boundary geometry , there should be an associated conserved charge .",
    "we suppose that the boundary geometry is foliated by spacelike surfaces @xmath75 with metric @xmath76 @xmath77 thus the conserved charge associated with time translation @xmath78 is the mass of spacetime @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the proper energy density while @xmath81 is a timelike unit normal to @xmath75 .",
    "the presence of the additional matter fields in ( [ action ] ) brings the potential danger of having divergent contributions coming from both the gravitational and matter action @xcite . for a @xmath82 ( or faster ) decay of the dilaton field in the asymptotic region",
    ", we find that the prescription ( [ ct ] ) ( with @xmath83 removes all divergences of the total action , and implies the usual configurations mass @xmath84 @xmath85 being the area of the ( @xmath86 ) surface ( @xmath87 for @xmath41 ) .    as expected , a dilaton field which behaves asymptotically as @xmath88 necessarily contributes to the action and its variations in the asymptotic region .",
    "the counterterms ( [ ct ] ) will not yield in this case a finite action or mass .",
    "however , similar to the case of three dimensional gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field @xcite , it is still possible to obtain a finite mass by allowing @xmath89 to depend not only on the boundary metric @xmath90 , but also on the scalar field .",
    "this means that the quasilocal stress - energy tensor ( [ s1 ] ) also acquires a contribution coming from the matter field .    since a polynomial in @xmath9",
    "does not remove the divergencies , we are forced to consider terms containing the normal derivative of @xmath9 . following @xcite , we find that by adding a counterterm of the form @xmath91 to the expression ( [ ct ] ) , the divergence disappears . in ( [ ict ] ) with a suitable combination of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , in which case the matter conterterm reads @xmath94 , without changing the expressions for boundary stress - tensor , mass and total action .",

    "the nonvanishing components of the resulting boundary stress - tensor are ( here we choose @xmath96 to be a three surface of fixed @xmath48 , while @xmath97 ) @xmath98 we remark that , to leading order , this stress tensor is traceless as expected from the ads / cft correspondence , since even dimensional bulk theories are dual to odd dimensional cfts which have a vanishing trace anomaly . employing the ads / cft correspondence",
    ", this result can be interpreted as the expectation value of the stress tensor in the boundary cft @xcite .",
    "the mass of these solutions , as computed from ( [ mass ] ) is @xmath99 this coincides with the mass of the @xmath100 gauged supergravity solutions considered in @xcite , as computed by using an hamiltonian method ( the asymptotics of those solutions is a particular case of ( [ expansion1 ] ) ) .",
    "also , it can be proven that the above counterterm choice yields a finite euclidean action .",
    "recently martinez , troncoso and zanelli have found an exact black hole solution of the field equations ( [ einstein - eqs ] ) , corresponding to a @xmath101 truncation of the action ( [ action ] ) and a scalar potential @xcite @xmath102 the metric and the scalar field are given by @xmath103 , \\\\",

    "to solve the field equation ( [ eqs ] ) , we change to dimensionless variables by using the rescaling @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , together with a rescaling of the potential .",
    "given the inherent difficulties involved in studies of these models , we will restrict ourselves to the case of a potential on the form @xmath116 ( where we suppose @xmath117 ) .",
    "this type of potential can be obtained when a higher dimensional theory is compactified to four dimensions , including various supergravity models ( see @xcite for a recent discussion of these aspects ) .    for @xmath118 ,",
