    "moreover , since the family @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 forms a one - parameter continuous semigroup of holomorphic self - mappings of @xmath0 , it follows from the continuous version of the denjoy - wolff theorem ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) that the limit point @xmath15 in ( [ n1 ] ) is unique and does not depend on @xmath7 .    without loss of generality we may set @xmath16 .",

    "it is rather a transparent fact ( see sections 2 and 3 for details ) that if @xmath13 is a semigroup with a boundary denjoy - wolff point @xmath54 ( say @xmath16 ) and @xmath55 is the common solution to abel s equations ( [ v1 ] ) normalized by ( [ v3 ] ) , then an outer ( respectively , inner ) conjugator of @xmath23 exists if and only if @xmath10 lies in ( respectively , contains ) a half - plane @xmath56 .    in both cases",
    "the conjugate semigroup @xmath57 of linear fractional transformations ( see formulas ( [ v2 ] ) and ( [ v3 ] ) ) is a group of automorphisms of @xmath0 if and only if @xmath56 is horizontal , i.e. , its boundary is parallel to the real axis .",
    "the latter situation is of special interest for inner conjugation since equation ( [ v3 ] ) means that the semigroup @xmath13 forms a group of automorphisms of the domain @xmath58 which is called a _ backward flow invariant domain _ for @xmath23 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will concentrate on this issue in section 3 for semigroup generators which are fractionally differentiable at their boundary denjoy - wolff points . in the meantime",
    "we need the following observation .    it can be shown ( see @xcite and lemma 3 below ) that if @xmath55 belongs to @xmath17 $ ] , then the angular limit @xmath59 exists and belongs to @xmath60 $ ] .",

    "analytic descriptions of functions convex in one direction have been presented by many mathematicians using different methods of classical geometric function theory including the prime ends theory and julia s lemma ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . for completeness",
    "we begin with the following description of the class @xmath17 $ ] , which is a slight generalization of those given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and is based on the relations between this class and the class @xmath29 $ ] .    [ lem1 ]",

    "in addition , we know that the function @xmath100 defined by @xmath101 admits the berkson - porta representation ( [ n6 ] ) with ( [ n7 ] ) . therefore , the cauchy problem @xmath102 is solvable with @xmath103 for each @xmath104 and all @xmath8 .",
