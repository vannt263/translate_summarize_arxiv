    "we introduce a new class of finite dimensional gentle algebras , the _ surface algebras _ , which includes the hereditary , the tilted , and the cluster - tilted algebras of dynkin type @xmath0 and euclidean type @xmath1 .",
    "these algebras are constructed from an unpunctured riemann surface with boundary and marked points by introducing cuts in internal triangles of an arbitrary triangulation of the surface .    to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath2 be a triangulation of a bordered unpunctured riemann surface @xmath3 with a set of marked points @xmath4 , and let @xmath5 be the bound quiver associated to @xmath2 as in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding algebra @xmath6 , over an algebraically closed field @xmath7 , is a finite dimensional gentle algebra @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 is the endomorphism algebra of the cluster - tilting object corresponding to @xmath2 in the generalized cluster category associated to @xmath9 , see @xcite .",
    "each internal triangle in the triangulation @xmath2 corresponds to an oriented @xmath10-cycle in the quiver @xmath11 , and the relations for the algebra @xmath8 state precisely that the composition of any two arrows in an oriented @xmath10-cycle is zero in @xmath8 .",
    "if the surface is a disc or an annulus then the corresponding cluster algebra , as defined in @xcite , is acyclic , and , in this case , the algebra @xmath8 is cluster - tilted of type @xmath0 , if @xmath3 is a disc ; and of type @xmath1 , if @xmath3 is an annulus @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that every cluster - tilted algebra is the trivial extension of a tilted algebra @xmath12 by the canonical @xmath12-bimodule @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the standard duality .",
    "the quiver of the tilted algebra @xmath12 contains no oriented cycle and can be obtained from the quiver of @xmath8 by an admissible cut , that is , by deleting one arrow in every oriented @xmath10-cycle .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in @xcite that an algebra is iterated tilted of dynkin type @xmath15 of global dimension at most two if and only if it is the quotient of a cluster - tilted algebra of the same type by an admissible cut .",
    "it is then natural to ask , what kind of algebras we can get from admissible cuts of algebras @xmath8 coming from other surfaces .",
    "this motivates the definition of a _ surface algebra _ , which is constructed by cutting a triangulation @xmath2 of a surface @xmath9 at internal triangles .",
    "cutting an internal triangle @xmath16 means replacing the triangle @xmath16 by a quadrilateral @xmath17 with one side on the boundary of the same surface @xmath3 with an enlarged set of marked points @xmath18 , see definition [ def cut ] . cutting as many internal triangles",
    "as we please , we obtain a partial triangulation @xmath19 of a surface with marked points @xmath20 , to which we can associate an algebra @xmath21 in a very similar way to the construction of @xmath8 from @xmath2 , see definition [ def surface algebra ] .",
    "this algebra @xmath22 is called a _ surface algebra of type _ @xmath9 .",
    "a surface algebra is called an _ admissible cut _ if it is obtained by cutting every internal triangle exactly once .",
    "our first main results are the following .",
    "_ every surface algebra is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a partial cluster - tilting object in a generalized cluster category .",
    "more precisely , if the surface algebra @xmath23 is given by the cut @xmath24 of the triangulated surface @xmath25 , then @xmath26 where @xmath19 denotes the object in cluster category @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath19 . _    _ if @xmath24 is an admissible cut of @xmath25 then _    @xmath28 is an admissible cut of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath22 is of global dimension at most two .",
    "the tensor algebra of @xmath22 with respect to the @xmath22-bimodule @xmath29 is isomorphic to the algebra @xmath8 .",
    "part ( c ) of theorem 2 implies that the cluster category associated to @xmath22 is the same as the cluster category associated to the surface @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the surface algebras @xmath22 which are admissible cuts are algebras of cluster type @xmath9 in the sense of @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study algebras of global dimension two whose cluster type is acyclic , which , in our setting , corresponds to admissible cuts from a disc or an annulus .    applying the result of @xcite mentioned above , we see that the admissible cut surface algebras of the disc with @xmath30 marked points are precisely the iterated tilted algebras of type @xmath31 whose global dimension is at most two . for all surfaces other than the disc ,",
    "we show that the surface algebras form several different classes under derived equivalence .",
    "for admissible cuts from the annulus , this recovers a result in @xcite .    to show that the surface algebras are not always derived equivalent",
    ", we use an invariant introduced by avella - alaminos and geiss in @xcite , which we call the ag - invariant for short . for each surface algebra @xmath22 ,",
    "we compute the ag - invariant in terms of the original triangulated surface @xmath25 and the number of cuts on each boundary component , see theorem [ thm ag calc ] .",
    "in particular , we show that already for the annulus there are different cuts coming from the same triangulation @xmath2 such that the corresponding surface algebras have different ag invariants and hence are not derived equivalent .",
    "we want to point out here that ladkani has very recently also computed the ag invariant for the algebras @xmath8 ( without cuts ) in the special case where each boundary component has exactly one marked point , and used it to classify the surfaces @xmath9 such that any two triangulations @xmath32 of @xmath9 give rise to derived equivalent algebras @xmath33 and @xmath34 , see @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that the ag - invariant has been used by bobinski and buan in @xcite to classify algebras that are derived equivalent to cluster - tilted algebras of type @xmath15 and @xmath35 .",
    "we then study the module categories of the surface algebras .",
    "since surface algebras are gentle , their indecomposable modules are either string modules or band modules . in the special case where the surface is not cut ,",
    "the indecomposable modules and the irreducible morphisms in the module category of the algebras @xmath8 have been described by brstle and zhang in @xcite in terms of the of generalized arcs on the surface @xmath25 .",
    "one of the main tools used in @xcite is the description of irreducible morphisms between string modules by butler and ringel @xcite .",
    "we generalize the results of brstle and zhang to the case of arbitrary surface algebras @xmath22 , and we describe the indecomposable modules in terms of certain permissible generalized arcs in the surface @xmath24 and the irreducible morphisms in terms of pivots of these arcs in the surface . in this way , we construct a combinatorial category @xmath36 of permissible generalized arcs in @xmath24 and define a functor @xmath37 this construction is inspired by the construction of the cluster category of type @xmath15 as a category of diagonals in a convex polygon by caldero , chapoton and the second author in @xcite .",
    "we then show the following theorem .",
    "the functor @xmath38 is faithful and induces a dense , faithful functor from @xmath39 to the category of string modules over @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 maps irreducible morphisms to irreducible morphisms and commutes with auslander - reiten translations .",
    "if the surface @xmath3 is a disc , then @xmath38 is an equivalence of categories .",
    "if the algebra @xmath40 is of finite representation type , then @xmath38 is an equivalence of categories .    as an application of our results",
    ", we provide a geometric model for the module category of any iterated tilted algebra of type @xmath15 of global dimension two in terms of permissible diagonals in a partially triangulated polygon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect 2 ] , we recall definitions and results that we need at a later stage .",
    "section [ sect 3 ] is devoted to the definition of surface algebras and their fundamental properties .",
    "the computation of the ag - invariant is contained in section [ sect 4 ] and , in section [ sect 5 ] , we study the module categories of surface algebras in terms of arcs in the surface .",
    "the application to iterated tilted algebras of type @xmath15 is presented in section [ sect 6 ] .",
    "in this section , we recall concepts that we need and fix notations .",
    "recall from @xcite that a finite - dimensional algebra @xmath41 is _ gentle _ if it admits a presentation @xmath42 satisfying the following conditions :    * at each point of @xmath43 start at most two arrows and stop at most two arrows .",

    "an algebra @xmath42 where @xmath44 is generated by paths and @xmath52 satisfies the two conditions ( g1 ) and ( g4 ) is called a _ string algebra _ ( see @xcite ) ,",

    "band _ is a string @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , and any power of @xmath75 is a string , but @xmath75 itself is not a proper power of a string .",
    "any string @xmath63 gives rise to a string module @xmath76 over @xmath41 , whose underlying vector space consists of the direct sum of one copy of the field @xmath7 for each vertex in the string @xmath63 , and the action of an arrow @xmath77 on @xmath76 is induced by the identity morphism @xmath78 between the copies of @xmath7 at the endpoints of @xmath77 , if @xmath77 or @xmath79 is in @xmath63 , and zero otherwise .",
