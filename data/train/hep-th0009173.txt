    "nevertheless , over twenty years , many attempts to measure this force directly were made @xcite .",
    "( the cited measurements include insulators as well as conducting surfaces . ) until recently , the most convincing experimental evidence came from the study of thin helium films @xcite ; there the corresponding lifshitz theory @xcite has been confirmed over nearly 5 orders of magnitude in the van der waals potential ( nearly two orders of magnitude in distance ) .",

    "however , in a susy theory , if supersymmetric boundary conditions are imposed ( the unconstrained components of the fermion and scalar fields are all periodic , for example ) , the fermionic casimir energy will just cancel that due to the bosons .",

    "the theory of the casimir energy for a dielectric ball was first worked out by me 20 years ago @xcite .",

    "although , in general , this expression is not finite , there are several methods of isolating the divergences , at least if the ball is tenuous , ( @xmath86 ) , and the finite repulsive observable casimir energy is @xcite @xmath112    what is most remarkable about this result is that it coincides with the van der waals energy calculated two years earlier for this nontrivial geometry .",
    "that is , starting from the casimir - polder potential ( [ caspol ] ) we summed the pairwise potentials between molecules making up the media .",
    "a sensible way to regulate this calculation is dimensional continuation , similar to that described above .",
    "that is , we evaluate the integral @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the angle between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , by first regarding @xmath117 so the integral exists .",
    "the integral may be done exactly in terms of gamma functions , which when continued to @xmath71 , @xmath94 yields eq .",
    "( [ nobulk ] ) @xcite",
    ".    thus there can hardly be any doubt that the casimir effect , in the tenuous limit , coincides with the van der waals attraction between molecules .",
    "this seems to go some way toward providing understanding of this zero - point fluctuation phenomenon .",
    "but the subject is not closed .",
    "two years ago romeo and i demonstrated that for a dilute cylinder the van der waals energy is _ zero _ @xcite .",
    "presumably the same holds for the casimir energy , in order @xmath118 , but a demonstration of that is not yet at hand .",
    "( it turns out to be quite difficult to compute the casimir effect for a dielectric cylinder . )",
    "remarkably , for a dilute cylinder with constant speed of light inside and out , @xmath119 , it has been demonstrated that the casimir energy vanishes , that is , the energy is of order @xmath120 @xcite , but that would seem to be a completely different case .",
    "_ sonoluminescence _ refers to that remarkable phenomenon in which a small bubble of air injected into a container of water and suspended in a node of a strong acoustic standing wave emits light .",
    "more precisely , if it is driven with a standing wave of about 20,000 hz at an overpressure of about 1 atm , the bubble expands and contracts in concert with the wave , from a maximum radius @xmath121 cm to a minimum radius of @xmath122 cm .",
    "exactly at minimum radius roughly 1 million optical photons are emitted , for a total energy liberated of 10 mev . for a review of the experimental situation as of a few years ago ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "julian schwinger , informed of these experiments by putterman , immediately assumed the effect derived from a dynamical version of the casimir effect , and published in the last few years of his life a series of papers in the pnas - usa attempting to account for the observations in this way @xcite .",
    "subsequently a number of other have jumped on this bandwagon @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the `` dynamical casimir effect '' remains largely unknown .",
    "schwinger and his followers had to rely on the known results for the casimir effect with static boundary conditions .",
    "two possible avenues then appeared :    * one could employ the adiabatic approximation , which does not seem unreasonable , since the time scale for emission of the photons , @xmath123  s , is far longer than the characteristic optical time scale , @xmath124 s. schwinger @xcite , and carlson et al .",
    "@xcite , then used the divergent bulk energy term @xmath125 if a reasonable cutoff is inserted , the required 10 mev of energy is indeed present .",
    "my objection to this is that it now seems unequivocal that the casimir energy for a ( dilute ) dielectric ball is given by the finite expression ( [ nobulk ] )",
    ". the divergent expression ( [ bulk ] ) is properly absorbed in a renormalization of the material properties .",
    "( [ nobulk ] ) is used , the casimir energy is _ ten orders of magnitude too small to be relevant .",
    "_    * the second avenue , followed by schwinger @xcite and liberati et al .",
    "@xcite , is to use the instantaneous or sudden approximation , in which the static bubble simply disappears .",
    "then the photon production rate can be calculated from the overlap of the two static configurations , through the bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "again , reasonable agreement with observations is reported .",
    "my objection here is that impossibly short time scales are required . for the sudden approximation to make sense , the time scale @xmath126 of collapse must be small compared to @xmath127 s. but in fact , the overall collapse time scale is @xmath128 s , and the emission time scale is probably @xmath129 s. an estimate of what one expects with reasonable numbers may be obtained from the unruh temperature @xcite @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the acceleration of the surface .",
    "estimating @xmath131 by @xmath132 , @xmath3 being some relevant bubble radius , and recognizing that the observations are consistent with a photon temperature of order 20,000 k , we estimate the required time scale by @xmath133 which once again seems physically unrealizable . , the leading approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite , is used .",
    "see also ref .",
    "a great many isolated facts about the casimir effect are now known :    * the dimensional dependence for planes and hyperspheres is now known . * the equivalence of the van der waals force and the casimir force for dilute media is definitively established .",
    "* moreover , important applications of the casimir effect to many fields , such as cosmology , have been made .",
    "* we can not predict , _ a priori _ , the sign of the effect .",
    "* there are divergences occurring , for example with the dielectric ball , the nature of which is not well understood . * physically , why does the casimir energy for a sphere in even dimensions diverge ?",
    "* most importantly , can one make progress in understanding the dynamical casimir effect ?",
