    "among the outstanding problems in science today is the identity of the dark matter of the universe @xcite .",
    "the existence of dark matter is implied by a large number of observations , including the dynamics of galaxy clusters , the rotation curves of individual galaxies , the abundances of light elements , gravitational lensing , and the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the energy fraction of the universe in dark matter is observed to be 26% @xcite .",
    "the dark matter must be non - baryonic , cold and collisionless .",
    "_ non - baryonic _ means that the dark matter is not made of ordinary atoms and molecules .",
    "_ cold _ means that the primordial velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles is sufficiently small , less than of order @xmath0 today , so that it may be set equal to zero as far as the formation of large scale structure and galactic halos is concerned .",
    "_ collisionless _ means that the dark matter particles have , in first approximation , only gravitational interactions .",
    "particles with the required properties are referred to as ` cold dark matter ' ( cdm ) .",
    "the leading cdm candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with mass in the 100 gev range , axions with mass in the @xmath1 ev range , and sterile neutrinos with mass in the kev range .",
    "one approach to the identification of dark matter is to attempt to detect dark matter particles in the laboratory .",
    "wimp dark matter can be searched for on earth by looking for the recoil of nuclei that have been struck by a wimp @xcite .",
    "axion dark matter can be searched for by looking for the conversion of axions to photons in an electromagnetic cavity permeated by a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of photons produced in the cavity is directly related to the axion energy spectrum in the laboratory since energy is conserved in the conversion process : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the frequency of a photon produced by axion to photon conversion , @xmath4 the energy of the axion that converted into it , @xmath5 the axion mass and @xmath6 the velocity of the axion in the rest frame of the cavity . since the velocity dispersion of halo axions is of order @xmath7 , the width of the axion signal is of order @xmath8 .",
    "if , for example , the axion signal occurs at 1 ghz , its width is of order 1 khz . on the other hand ,",
    "the resolution with which the signal can be spectrum analyzed is the inverse of the time over which it is observed @xcite . if the signal is observed for 100 seconds , for example , the achievable resolution is 0.01 hz .",
    "thus , under the example given , the kinetic energy spectrum of halo axions is resolved into @xmath9 bins .",
    "the earth s rotation changes the velocities relative to the laboratory frame by amounts of order 1 m / s in 100 s , and therefore introduces dppler shifts of order @xmath10 ( 300 km / s)(1 m / s ) @xmath11 , which is 0.003 hz in the example given .",
    "if the data taking runs are much longer than 100 s , the resolution is limited by the dppler shifts . however , for a given velocity vector in the rest frame of the galaxy , the dppler shifts may be removed and in that case the resolution can be much higher than 0.01 hz .",
    "narrow peaks in the velocity spectrum of dark matter on earth are expected because a galactic halo grows continuously by accreting the dark matter that surrounds it .",
    "the infalling dark matter produces a set of flows in the halo since the dark matter particles oscillate back and forth many times in the galactic gravitational potential well before they are thermalized by gravitational scattering off inhomogeneities in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the flows are cold and collisionless and therefore produce caustics @xcite .",
    "caustics are surfaces in physical space where the density is very high . at the location of a caustic , a flow",
    " folds back \" in phase space .",
    "each flow has a local density and velocity vector , and produces a peak with the corresponding properties in the energy spectrum of photons from axion conversion in a cavity detector .",
    "all three components of a flow s velocity vector can be determined by observing the peak s frequency and dppler s shift as a function of time of day and time of year @xcite .",
    "thus an axion dark matter signal would be a rich source of information on the formation history of the milky way halo .",
    "moreover , the flows are relevant to the search itself , before a signal is found , because a narrow prominent peak may have higher signal to noise than the full signal .    motivated by these considerations ,",
    "the self - similar infall model of galactic halo formation @xcite was used to predict the densities and velocity vectors of the milky way flows @xcite .",
    "the original model was generalized to include angular momentum for the infalling particles .",
    "the flow properties near earth are sensitive to the dark matter angular momentum distribution because the angular momentum distribution determines the structure and location of the halo s inner caustics @xcite .",
    "if the dark matter particles fall in with net overall rotation , the inner caustics are rings .",
    "the self - similar infall model predicts the radii of the caustic rings .",
    "the caustic rings produce bumps in the galactic rotation curve at those radii . mainly from the study of galactic rotation curves , but also from other data , evidence was found for caustic rings of dark matter at the locations predicted by the self - similar infall model .",
    "the evidence is summarized in ref.@xcite .",
    "the model of the milky way halo that results from fitting the self - similar infall model to the data is called the  caustic ring model \" .",
    "it is a detailed description of the full phase - space structure of the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "the caustic ring model predicts that the local velocity distribution on earth is dominated by a single flow , dubbed the",
    " big flow \" @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is our proximity to a cusp in the 5th caustic ring in the milky way .",
    "up to a two - fold ambiguity , the big flow has a known velocity vector ; see section v. its density on earth is estimated to be of order @xmath12 gr/@xmath13 , i.e. a factor three larger than typical estimates ( @xmath14 gr/@xmath13 ) found in the litterature for the total dark matter density on earth .",
    "the existence of the big flow provides strong additional motivation for high resolution analysis of the output of the cavity detector , since it produces a prominent narrow peak in the energy spectrum .",
    "it is desirable to have an estimate of the width of that peak since this determines the signal to noise ratio of a high resolution search for it .",
    "the width of the peak is the energy dispersion of the big flow .",
    "one of our main goals is to place an upper limit on the energy dispersion of the big flow from the observed sharpness of the 5th caustic ring .",
    "more generally we want to study the evolution of velocity dispersion along cold collision flows , the relation between velocity dispersion and the distance scale over which caustics are smoothed , and the behavior of velocity dispersion very close to a caustic .",
    "our results may be relevant to other cold collisionless flows , in particular the streams of stars that result from the tidal disruption of galactic sattelites , such as the sagittarius stream @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we study the evolution of velocity dispersion along a cold collisionless flow in one dimension . in section iii",
    ", we do the same for an axially symmetric flow in two dimensions . in section",
    "iv we present a technique for obtaining the leading behavior of velocity dispersion near caustics .",
    "we apply it to fold caustics and cusp caustics . in section",
    "v , we use our results to derive an upper limit on the energy disperion of the big flow from the sharpness of the 5th caustic ring and make a prediction for the relative dispersions of its velocity components .",
    "section vi provides a brief summary .",
    "in this section , we study how velocity dispersion changes along a cold collisionless flow in one dimension .",
    "we consider a large number of particles moving in a time - independent potential @xmath15 and forming a stationary flow .",
    "we first discuss the case where the velocity dispersion vanishes and then the case where the velocity dispersion is small .",
    "in the case of zero velocity dispersion , all particles have the same energy @xmath16 hence their velocity at location @xmath17 is @xmath18 for the sake of definiteness , we assume that the particles are bound to a minimum of @xmath15 , going back and forth between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , defined by @xmath21 . for @xmath22",
    "there are two flows , one with @xmath23 and one with @xmath24 .",
    "there are no flows at @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "since the overall flow is stationary ( @xmath27 ) , the continuity equation @xmath28 implies that the densities of both the left- and right - moving flows equal @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "@xmath30 is the flux ( number of particles per unit time ) in the left- and the right - moving flows .",
    "there are two caustics , one at @xmath19 and the other at @xmath20 .",
    "the caustics are simple fold ( @xmath31 ) catastrophes . for @xmath17 near @xmath19 @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "hence @xmath34 as @xmath17 approaches @xmath19 from above .",
    "likewise @xmath35 when @xmath17 approaches @xmath20 from below .",
    "next we consider the same flow but with a small energy dispersion @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the energy distribution @xmath37 is narrowly peaked about its average @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath36 is defined as usual by @xmath39 brackets indicate averaging over the energy distribution . at location @xmath17 ,",
    "the two flows have average velocity @xmath40 and velocity dispersion @xmath41 we assumed that @xmath37 goes to zero rapidly as @xmath42 increases , as is the case e.g. for a gaussian distribution .",
    "( [ barv ] ) is exact then in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "also eq .",
    "( [ delv ] ) is exact in that limit provided that , in addition , @xmath44 does not vanish , i.e. that one is not close to a caustic .",
    "the density of each of the flows is given by eq .",
    "( [ denx ] ) , with @xmath45 replaced by @xmath38 .",
    "the phase - space density of the flow is therefore @xmath46 it is independent of @xmath17 , as required by liouville s theorem .",
    "velocity dispersion smoothes the caustics . indeed , when @xmath47 , the caustics are spread over a thickness ( @xmath48 ) @xmath49 the density reaches at the caustics a maximum value @xmath50",
    "also the velocity dispersion reaches a maximum value @xmath51 it is interesting that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the same at one caustic as at the other .",
    "( [ maxveldis ] ) follows from eq .",
    "( [ maxden ] ) and liouville s theorem .",
    "it also follows from the fact that @xmath54 at the caustics , so that @xmath55 there .",
    "in this section we study a stationary , axisymmetric , cold , collisioness flow of particles moving in two dimensions in an axisymmetric time - independent potential @xmath56 . again",
    ", we discuss first the flow with vanishing velocity dispersion , and then the flow with a small velocity dispersion .      consider a flow of particles moving in a plane , under the influence of a potential @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 are polar coordinates in the plane .",
    "all particles have the same energy @xmath45 and the same angular momentum @xmath58 .",
    "hence the velocity field @xmath59 with @xmath60 where @xmath61 provided @xmath62 the particles have a non - zero distance of closest approach @xmath63 : @xmath64 .",
    "let us assume they also have a turnaround radius @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "there are two flows for @xmath68 .",
    "we call them the `` in '' ( @xmath69 ) and `` out '' ( @xmath70 ) flows",
    ". there are no flows for @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "since the flow is stationary and axisymmetric , the continuity equation implies that the density of particles of both the in and out flows is @xmath73 where @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "@xmath30 is the number of particles per unit time and per radian .",
    "there are simple fold caustics at @xmath74 and @xmath75 . when @xmath76 approaches @xmath63 from above @xmath77 whereas @xmath78 when @xmath76 approaches @xmath65 from below .",
    "we now consider the same flow as in the previous subsection but with a gaussian distribution of energy and angular momentum of the form @xmath79 for this distribution @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 the most general gaussian would allow @xmath83 .",
    "however our main interest is the evolution of the velocity dispersion of flows of cold dark matter particles falling onto a galactic halo and sloshing back and forth thereafter .",
    "we now argue that eq .",
    "( [ diag ] ) is a good approximation for that case .",
    "the primordial velocity dispersion @xmath84 of a flow of cold dark matter particles is negligibly small . by primordial velocity dispersion , we mean the velocity dispersion that the particles have in the absence of structure formation .",
    "@xmath85 is typical of axions , @xmath86 for wimps , and @xmath87 for sterile neutrinos .",
    "the main contributions to the velocity dispersion of a flow of cold dark matter particles falling onto a galaxy are instead from gravitational scattering off inhomogeneities in the galaxy ( such as globular clusters and molecular clouds ) and from the growth by gravitational instability of small scale density perturbations in the flow itself .",
    "when a process produces a velocity dispersion @xmath88 , the associated energy dispersion is of order @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the velocity of the flow in the galactic reference frame when the process occurs , and the associated angular momentum dispersion is of order @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the distance from the galactic center where the process occurs .",
    "so , @xmath36 and @xmath93 are not independent quantities but related by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an average flow velocity , say 300 km / s for our milky way galaxy , and @xmath96 is an average distance from the galactic center where the flow acquired velocity dispersion",
    ". we may only give a rough guess for the order of magnitude of @xmath96 , perhaps 100 kpc for our galaxy .",
    "in view of eq .",
    "( [ relat ] ) we define an overall flow velocity dispersion @xmath97 : @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit where the galaxy has no angular momentum ( @xmath100 ) , there is no preference for the many events that produce velocity dispersion to increase or decrease @xmath101 since this quantity is odd under @xmath102 .",
    "therefore @xmath101 is proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "disk galaxies have angular momentum but , relative to their size and typical velocities , that angular momentum is small .",
    "indeed all dimensionless measures of galactic angular momentum have values much less than one .",
    "one such measure is the galactic spin parameter @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the angular momentum of the galaxy , @xmath106 its net mechanical ( kinetic plus gravitational ) energy and @xmath107 its mass .",
    "@xmath108 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "a typical value is @xmath109 .",
    "another dimensionless measure of galactic angular momentum is the ratio @xmath110 of caustic ring radius @xmath63 to turnaround radius @xmath65 for the flows of dark matter particles in the halo .",
    "a typical value is @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "finally , the dimensionless number that controls the amount of galactic angular momentum in the caustic ring model is @xmath112 .",
    "a typical value is @xmath113 0.2 . since @xmath101 is proportional to galactic angular momentum , and galactic angular momentum",
    "is of order 0.1 in dimensionless units , @xmath101 is suppressed relative to @xmath114 by a similar factor of order 0.1 . to simplify our calculations",
    ", we set @xmath101 = 0 as a first approximation .",
    "provided @xmath36 and @xmath93 are sufficiently small , we may within the support of the @xmath115 distribution express small deviations @xmath116 and @xmath117 of the particle energy and angular momentum from its average values as linear functions of small deviations @xmath118 and @xmath119 of the velocity components from their average values at a given position @xmath57 .",
    "henceforth we set @xmath120 to avoid cluttering the equations unnecessarily .",

    "we may use eq .",
    "( [ liou2 ] ) to estimate the maximum density and velocity dispersion at the caustics since that equation follows directly from liouville s theorem .",

    "the local velocity dispersion becomes large when a caustic is approached since the physical space density becomes large but the phase - space density remains constant . in this section",

    "we set the mass of the particles equal to one , as in the previous section .",
    "we assume the flow to be stationary for simplicity .",
    "this is not an essential assumption . in the limit of zero velocity dispersion ,",
    "the flow at a given time is described by the map @xmath154 which gives the position of the particles as a function of their age .",
    "we define the age @xmath155 of a particle as minus the time at which it passes through its maximum @xmath17 value .",

    "the sharpness of the triangular feature in the iras map implies that the 5th caustic ring is spread over a distance less than approximately 10 pc .",
    "the particles forming a caustic ring fall in and out of the galaxy near the galactic plane .",
    "let @xmath45 and @xmath58 be respectively the energy and angular momentum of the particles that form the 5th caustic ring and are in the galactic plane .",
    "we have @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the radial velocity of the particles at galactocentric radius @xmath76 and @xmath56 is the gravitational potential in which they move .",
    "we will use @xmath237 consistent with a flat galactic rotation curve , with rotation velocity @xmath238 . for the milky way , @xmath239 220 km / s .",
    "the inner radius @xmath63 of a caustic ring is the distance of closest approach to the galactic center of the particles in the galactic plane .",
    "therefore @xmath240 small deviations @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 from the average values of @xmath45 , @xmath58 and @xmath63 are related by @xmath244 in view of eq .",
    "( [ gravpot ] ) this may be rewritten @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the velocity in the direction of galactic rotation of the particles that are in the galactic plane .",
    "the spread @xmath247 in caustic ring radius is therefore given by @xmath248 \\label{crs}\\ ] ] where , as in section iii , brackets indicate averaging over the @xmath249 distribution of the dark matter particles , @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "the second term in the square brackets on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ crs ] ) dominates over the first term since @xmath252 and @xmath95 is of order @xmath253 whereas @xmath96 is much larger than @xmath63 , as was discussed in section iii .",
    "the second term also dominates over the third term since @xmath254 hence @xmath255 where we used @xmath256 km / s @xcite .",
    "it remains to estimate @xmath96 , the average distance from the galactic center where the processes took place by which the flow presently constituting the 5th caustic ring acquired velocity dispersion .",
    "of course it is hard to give a precise value .",
    "the present turnaround radius of the flow constituting the 5th caustic ring is @xmath257 = 121 kpc @xcite . as a rough estimate , we set @xmath258 . with @xmath259 10 pc ,",
    "this yields @xmath260 in ref .",
    "@xcite , an upper limit on @xmath97 was estimated using @xmath261 with @xmath65 the turnaround radius and @xmath90 the velocity of the flow at the caustic .",
    "this yielded @xmath262 m / s .",
    "although far more work went into justifying eqs .",
    "( [ almost ] ) and ( [ ldv ] ) , the two estimates are qualitatively consistent since @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "the difference between the two estimates may be taken as a measure of the uncertainty on the bound . at any rate ,",
    "the bound on @xmath97 from the sharpness of caustic rings is extraordinarily severe in view of the commonly made assertion that the dark matter falling onto a galaxy is in clumps with velocity dispersion of order 10 km / s .    to obtain an upper limit on the energy dispersion @xmath265 of the flow forming the 5th caustic ring we set @xmath266 300 km / s",
    "this yields @xmath267 if the axion frequency is 1 ghz , as in the example given in the introduction , the upper limit on the widths of the peaks associated with the big flow and the little flow in the cavity detector of dark matter axions is of order 0.24 hz .",
    "let us emphasize that there is nothing to suggest that the upper bound is saturated .      in the caustic ring model of the milky way halo ,",
    "the big flow has a large density on earth as a result of our proximity to a cusp in the 5th caustic ring of dark matter . the inner radius of the 5th caustic ring , derived from a rise in the milky way rotation curve and from the triangular feature in the iras map of the galactic plane , is @xmath63 = 8.31 kpc whereas its outer radius is @xmath268 = 8.44 kpc @xcite .",
    "see fig .  2 .",
    "these values assume that our own distance to the galactic center , which sets the scale , is 8.5 kpc .",
    "note that the values of the inner and outer radii are at the tangent point of our line of sight to the 5th caustic ring .",
    "if axial symmetry is assumed , as in the caustic ring model , we are just outside the tricusp cross - section of the 5th caustic ring , near the cusp at the outer radius , which we call henceforth the ` outer cusp ' . in that case",
    "there are two flows on earth associated with the 5th caustic ring , the big flow and the little flow .",
    "the uncertainty on the density of the big flow is large since it is sensitive to our distance to the outer cusp .",
    "axial symmetry need not be a good approximation in this context .",
    "it could be sufficiently broken that we are located inside the tricusp instead of just outside .",
    "if we are located inside the tricusp , there are four flows on earth associated with the 5th caustic ring .",
    "if we are inside the tricusp and near the outer cusp three of the flows are big flows and the fourth is the little flow . the little flow is the same as before . it does not participate in the outer cusp singularity . the big flows do participate in the outer cusp singularity . the densities , velocities and velocity dispersions of the big flows are given by the equations in section iv as a function of position relative to the cusp .",
    "the big flows all have comparatively large dispersions in the component of velocity perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cusp , i.e. their velocity ellipses are elongated in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "motivated by the prospect that dark matter may some day be detected on earth , we set out to predict properties of the velocity dispersion ellipsoid of the big flow .",
    "the big flow dominates the local dark matter distribution in the caustic ring model of the milky way halo due to our proximity to the 5th caustic ring of dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "we analyzed a cold collisionless stationary flow in one dimension and derived how the velocity dispersion changes along such a flow .",
    "in one dimension the problem is simple because energy conservation and liouville s theorem control the outcome . to make headway in two dimensions we assumed that the potential in which the particles fall is axially symmetric as well as time - independent so that both energy and angular momentum are conserved .",
    "we derive the evolution of the velocity dispersion ellipse along a stationary axially symmetric flow under those assumptions .",
    "the local velocity dispersion always becomes large when approaching a caustic because the density becomes large but the phase space density is constant .",
    "we introduced a technique for obtaining the leading behavior of the velocity dispersion near caustics , and applied the technique to fold and cusp caustics .",
    "finally we used our results to obtain an upper limit on the energy dispersion of the big flow from the observed sharpness of the 5th caustic ring and a prediction for the dispersion in its velocity components .",
