    "the second law of thermodynamics has two major ingredients : the existence , in an equilibrium state , of a state function called the entropy , and the increase of the total entropy in a spontaneous transition between two equilibrium states .",
    "the discovery of the fluctuation theorem entails a double departure from this standard formulation of the second law .",
    "entropy is defined in nonequilibrium states , and it is even defined for a single realization in a non - extensive system , where it is a stochastic quantity which can increase as well as decrease with time . furthermore , the fluctuation theorem states ( in its simplest formulation ) that the fluctuating total entropy production @xmath0 obeys a symmetry property : @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this equality implies the second law inequality @xmath2 .",
    "the fluctuation theorem was first discovered in an ",
    "asymptotic version , \" preceding the definition of a proper stochastic entropy @xcite . in this version , one only focuses on the entropy production in idealized reservoirs . for a heat reservoir @xmath3 at temperature @xmath4",
    ", the entropy change is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the net amount of heat transferred from the system to reservoir @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath6 and hence @xmath5 are well defined even though the system need not be at equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a small system , the amount of heat @xmath6 will differ from one realization to another , so that this is a genuine stochastic quantity .",
    "coming back to the fluctuation theorem , one notes that the total entropy change is the sum of all the contributions : @xmath7 , which includes the entropy change @xmath8 of the system .",
    "since the entropy productions in the reservoirs are easier to monitor than the nonequilibrium stochastic system entropy @xmath8 ( where , for simplicity , we also avoid a discussion of the possible contribution to the entropy coming from interaction terms between system and reservoirs ) , it is of interest to identify situations in which the latter contribution is negligible .",
    "a good candidate is the asymptotic time regime for systems operating under steady state nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "indeed one intuitively expects that the heat ( and/or particle ) flows will be proportional to time , while the ( stochastic ) entropy of the system , being in a steady state , should remain more or less constant .",
    "hence the latter contribution becomes negligible in the long - time limit .",
    "this was indeed proven to be the case for a class of systems with bounded energy .",
    "one can then write @xmath9 known as the steady - state fluctuation theorem @xcite .    this asymptotic version of the fluctuation theorem can , however , break down when the energy of the system is unbounded @xcite .",
    "a well documented example is that of brownian particle in contact with one or several heat reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the large deviation function probes exponentially unlikely events for the heat evacuated to the reservoirs .",
    "such an event can however be the result of an exponentially unlikely initial energy of the system . in this case the entropy contribution of the system is no longer negligible and a fluctuation theorem in terms of reservoir entropies alone breaks down .    here , we study the less - documented case of particle transport . more precisely , we analyze particle transport through a system in contact with particle reservoirs @xcite .",
    "we evaluate analytically the large deviation function for the particle flux .",
    "we find that the asymptotic fluctuation theorem is satisfied under  natural \" conditions , which are typical for the distribution of the number of particles .",
    "more precisely , whereas the boltzmann factor allows for large energies , albeit in an exponentially unlikely way , the distribution @xmath10 for having @xmath11 particles in a system typically decays faster than exponential , due to the indistinguishability property giving rise to a @xmath12 contribution in the denominator . as a result",
    "the generating function @xmath13 is analytic in @xmath14 in the entire complex plane , and the stochastic operator describing the particle exchange has a discrete spectrum . under this condition , we are able to prove the validity of the steady state fluctuation theorem .",
    "when the system is coupled to particle reservoirs , a cumulated particle flux develops between the system and the reservoirs .",
    "the probability distribution of this flux typically depends on time in a complicated way .",
    "one may wonder whether there exist special initial conditions for which the functional form of this distribution does not change with time .",
    "we will identify such an initial distribution for the model under consideration .",
    "note that , from the point of view of a detector ( observer ) , the natural initial condition is to start to count the particle flux at time zero starting from a zero value .",
    "however , as we shall see , this is an unnatural initial condition from the  system s point of view , \" as correlations then develop between the observed flux and the state of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the particle transfer model and its basic mathematical framework . in sec .",
    "[ gf ] we introduce the generating function method to compute statistics of the particle fluxes between system and reservoirs . in sec .",
    "[ time ] we identify the joint distribution of system state and particle fluxes that propagates in time . in the long - time limit",
    ", it approaches an asymptotic regime characterized by a large deviation function . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] we verify the steady - state fluctuation relation and discuss its validity in the specific context of particle transfer .",
    "we consider a system which can exchange matter ( particles ) with two particle baths , with chemical potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 and temperatures @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the number of particles in the system will be denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath19 . for simplicity",
    ", we will operate in the limit of non - interacting , classical but indistinguishable particles , each of energy @xmath20 .",
    "we furthermore assume that the exchange of particles between system and baths can be described by a markovian jump process .",
    "consider an instant at which the system contains @xmath11 particles .",
    "let @xmath21 be the rate for a particle to jump into the system , while @xmath22 is the rate for a particle to jump out of the system , to and from thermal bath @xmath3 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding master equation for the probability to have @xmath11-particles in the system at time @xmath24 then reads @xmath25 with @xmath26    we start with a number of remarks .",
    "first , when in contact with a single bath @xmath3 , the steady state probability solution of ( [ eq-00 ] ) reduces to the poissonian equilibrium distribution @xmath27 , @xmath28 with a corresponding average number of particles @xmath29 given by @xmath30 we mention for further use the relation between this equilibrium density and the reservoir properties ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of single particle states with energy @xmath20 in the system and @xmath34 is the chemical potential of the @xmath3-th bath . since we are dealing with the classical limit , @xmath33 should be much larger than @xmath11 and the exponential in ( [ 0 ] ) is much smaller than unity . equation ( [ 0 ] ) is the detailed balance condition for the transport between the system and the @xmath3-th reservoir .",
    "second , due to the combinatorial factor @xmath12 , the probability distribution @xmath27 decays more quickly than exponentially for large @xmath11 .",
    "since there is a compelling physical reason for this factor , namely , the indistinguishability of particles , we expect this to be a genuine feature of a particle distribution function , and we will assume below a faster than exponential decay for the probability distribution even when operating under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "third , we mention the following exact time - dependent solution of ( [ eq-00 ] ) , namely , a propagating poisson distribution : @xmath35 with the mean number of particles in the system at time @xmath24 given by @xmath36 at steady state , @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the particle distribution maintains a poissonian equilibrium - like shape , even though it is in a nonequilibrium state .",
    "we next turn to our main quest , namely , the study of the fluctuation theorem .",
    "we first identify the entropy change @xmath38 in bath @xmath39 , for a given total elapsed time @xmath24 : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a register that adds ( subtracts ) @xmath42 whenever a particles crosses from heat bath @xmath3 to the system ( from the system to heat bath @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath41 is the _ _ n__et number crossing from bath @xmath3 to the system between time @xmath43 and @xmath24 _ _ p__lus the number that was on the register at time @xmath44 ( see below ) .",
    "all the particles have the same energy @xmath20 .",
    "in going from the first to the second line , we have used the conservation of energy , with the change in bath energy @xmath45 being equal to heat plus chemical energy , @xmath46 .",
    "transition to the third line is based on ( [ 0 ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of the stochastic bath entropies is thus reduced to that of the number of particles @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) transferred from baths to the system in time @xmath24 .",
    "since these numbers are deterministic functions of the system dynamics , the enlarged set of variables @xmath49 again defines a markov jump process , and the joint probability @xmath50 , to find @xmath11 particles in the system while having a cumulative transfer of @xmath51 particles in time @xmath24 , evolves according to the following master equation : @xmath52    as we proceed to show , it is possible to find an exact time - propagating solution of this equation , which allows us to find the asymptotic large time properties , in particular those of the stochastic entropy .",
    "this solution furthermore illustrates how this asymptotic regime is reached in the course of time .",
    "we finally note that due to particle conservation , the following identity holds at all times : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are , respectively , the number of particles in the system and the number of particles on registers @xmath42 and @xmath57 at time @xmath44 .",
    "we make two observations whose significance will reveal themselves when discussing the time - propagating solution of ( [ eq-2 ] ) .",
    "first , while it is quite natural and tempting , from the observer s point of view , to choose @xmath58 , the choice of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is in principle free , and could even be stochastic .",
    "second , it follows from ( [ par - cons ] ) that the condition @xmath59 propagates in time , i.e. , it implies that @xmath60 holds at all times .",
    "the solution of the master equation is facilitated by switching to the following generating function : @xmath61 the parameters @xmath62 are so - called  counting parameters \" that keepi track of the net number of particles transferred between the system and the corresponding reservoirs .",
    "we shall use @xmath63 to denote a dependence on @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    by combination with ( [ eq-2 ] )",
    "we find @xmath66 where the operator @xmath67 is defined as , @xmath68 with @xmath69 since the dependence on the counting parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq-7 ] ) is parametric , it suffices to evaluate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath70 as an operator with respect to the variable @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath71 be an eigenvector of @xmath72 with eigenvalue @xmath73 , @xmath74 with the expression ( [ eq-8 ] ) for the operator , the eigenfunctions are found by straightforward integration , @xmath75 where @xmath76    we now make the following crucial assumption , already mentioned in the introduction : we request that the eigenfunctions be analytic in the variable @xmath14 in the entire complex plane .",
    "analyticity imposes two restrictions on the exponent @xmath77 : it must be greater than or equal to zero , @xmath78 and it must be an integer .",
    "hence , setting @xmath79 with @xmath80 we find from ( [ eq-10a ] ) for the eigenspectrum of the operator @xmath81 @xmath82 the corresponding eigenfunction can now be written in the following compact way : @xmath83 at this point , we make two observations .",
    "first , the eigenvalue @xmath84 depends on @xmath85 only via @xmath86 and is invariant under the following interchanges : @xmath87 the eigenfunctions themselves , however , do not obey this symmetry .",
    "this property will be crucial to verify the steady state fluctuation theorem .",
    "second , the above set of eigenfunctions is complete in the sense that any analytic function of @xmath14 can be expanded in terms of this basis .",
    "furthermore , the expansion is unique as it corresponds to a taylor expansion around the point @xmath88 .",
    "hence we obtain the following explicit expression for the generating function ( assumed to be analytic in @xmath14 ) obeying ( [ eq-7 ] ) : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is expansion coefficient of the eigenfunction @xmath91 for the initial function @xmath92 . in the sequel",
    ", we will focus on a particular simple initial condition , corresponding to @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the kronecker delta .",
    "one reason is obvious : the corresponding eigenfunction is dominating the long - time limit , since it has the lowest eigenvalue , cf .",
    "( [ eq-11 ] ) .",
    "the other reason is that such an initial condition corresponds , for an appropriate choice of the coefficient @xmath95 , to a genuine probability distribution .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath96 suggests the following choice for @xmath95 : @xmath97 where the subtraction of @xmath98 guarantees normalization . referring to the appendix for the calculation of the inverse",
    ", we find that it leads to the following initial probability distribution : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a heaviside theta - function . the kronecker delta in ( [ distribution ] )",
    "imposes the condition that initially @xmath59 .",
    "this condition was to be expected since , as mentioned earlier , it propagates in time with @xmath101 at all times .",
    "the corresponding reduced distribution for the number of particles in the system , @xmath102 , is , as expected , the steady state distribution , cf .",
    "( [ eq-4 ] ) , @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "the reduced distribution for the initial cumulated particle transfer @xmath105 , see also fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , is obtained by summation of ( [ distribution ] ) over @xmath11 .",
    "the summation only affects the kronecker delta ; hence @xmath105 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) by the replacement of the kronecker delta @xmath106 with @xmath107 , but this factor is superfluous due to the presence of @xmath108 . we conclude that the reduced initial distribution @xmath105 is a product of two independent poissonian distributions .",
    "one can verify that the  natural initial condition `` @xmath109 does not lead to a time propagating solution , that is , it can not be expressed solely in terms of the eigenvector @xmath96 .",
    "this could have been anticipated from the fact that the propagating condition @xmath59 would then imply @xmath110 , which is incompatible with the ' ' propagating \" steady state statistics @xmath102 for @xmath11 .",
    "our main focus is the evaluation of the joint reduced distribution , @xmath111 .",
    "its generating function @xmath112 is found by setting @xmath113 in ( [ eq-17 ] ) : @xmath114 the @xmath115 term dominates the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq-17 ] ) for asymptotically long times @xmath116 .",
    "alternatively , this term corresponds to the full solution at all times for the initial condition identified in the previous section .",
    "we henceforth consider this case and can thus write @xmath117 with @xmath118 given by eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) . the corresponding joint probability @xmath111 is computed by taking the inverse transform of ( [ eq-17b ] ) : @xmath119 switching to the integration variable @xmath86 , and expanding the exponential of @xmath120 which appears inside @xmath121 , cf .",

    ", an additional simplification takes place as one finds asymptotically that the stochastic quantities @xmath133 and @xmath134 become identical ( see fig .  [ fig-1a ] ) .",
    "hence , the statistics in the long time limit are expressed in terms of a single flux @xmath135 .",
    "the corresponding probability distribution function for @xmath136 has the typical shape from large deviation theory , namely ,    @xmath137    with the large deviation function @xmath138 given by the following convex non - negative function : @xmath139 from eq .",

    "the steady state fluctuation theorem then requires that @xmath161 or , more precisely , that the large deviation function , eq .",
