    "ising spin models are probably the simplest interacting many particle systems to which many equilibrium and non - equilibrium phenomena found in nature can be mapped . in many cases the analysis of these models exhibit the basic features and consequently lead to a first understanding of the reality .",
    "therefore numerous investigations employing ising models exist in literature and are the subject of research activities .",
    "in addition to the questions in physics various problems arising in other fields ( biology , social science , information theory , etc . )",
    "are treated on the basis of ising models .    ising spin systems",
    "do not exhibit an intrinsic dynamics .",
    "thus the kinetics of these models is exclusively caused by couplings to bath systems of the environment .",
    "forty years ago glauber @xcite suggested a phenomenological master equation for a one - dimensional chain of ising spins with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "generalized to other spin arrangements and to other types of interactions ( for a review see @xcite ) the approach of glauber has been nearly exclusively used to describe the dynamics of the ising spin systems .",
    "note that the above comment also applies to the numerous monte carlo simulations performed on various models in the last decades @xcite .",
    "the transition rates of these phenomenological equations are required to satisfy detailed balance which guaranties relaxation to equilibrium for non driven systems . but this requirement is not sufficient to fix the rates completely .",
    "therefore ad hoc assumptions have to be employed which lead to the claim @xcite that kinetic ising models should not be regarded as faithful representations of processes occurring in real systems .",
    "it is microscopic quantum - statistical investigations which can remove the arbitrarily of the phenomenological equations .",
    "the tools for such a purpose are known since nearly half a century ago @xcite and many general approaches exist .",
    "the application of these general theories in ising models , however , are rare . a first approach of heims @xcite uses a very special and thus artificial spin - bath interaction .",
    "further approaches , both based on special realizations of the heat bath , are presented by martin @xcite and recently by park et al.@xcite .",
    "all these microscopic approaches find transition rates different from @xcite .",
    "a recent investigation for the linear response of a general ising model @xcite based on the mori theory results in the same conclusion .",
    "it is the aim of the present letter to calculate the transition rates under general aspects and to work out the generic behavior for the general non - linear case .",
    "thus neither specific ising models nor specific realizations of the baths are presumed .",
    "the ising spins may even interact with more than one bath to include problems like those treated in @xcite .",
    "calculations are performed on the bases of the robertson theory @xcite , although equivalent result @xcite are obtained by employing @xcite or the nakajima - zwanzig approach @xcite .    with rare exceptions like the original problem of glauber @xcite , analytical solutions of the master equations are not known and therefore approximations have to be employed .",
    "the typical procedure involves the elimination of fast degrees of freedom in the master equation .",
    "this leads to a reduced description and equations of motion result for the slow or relevant variables .",
    "the latter equations , in many cases , can directly be found by the robertson theory .",
    "thus both , the master equation and the equation of motion of such reduced descriptions can simultaneously be derived which justifies the above choice of the method .",
    "a system of @xmath0 quantum spins @xmath1 with @xmath2 is considered in the presence of time dependent external fields @xmath3 .",
    "the spins interact via an arbitrary ising spin - spin interaction @xmath4 and are described by the spin hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is presumed . both quantum spin @xmath7 operators @xmath8 with @xmath9 and ising spins",
    "@xmath10 are used simultaneously .",
    "the assembly of spins interact via spin bath interactions @xmath11 with a system consisting of @xmath12 adiabatically isolated baths @xmath13 .",
    "has no effect and that the coupling of @xcite or similar two spin couplings will lead to spatial correlations via @xmath14 . such a behavior may be possible but is certainly not the generic case . ]",
    "thus the total hamiltonian of the system is described by @xmath15 during the dynamic evolution of the spin system thermal equilibrium is presumed for each individual bath system @xmath16 leading to the statistical operator @xmath17 these requirements on the bath systems can be realized by sufficient large bath heat capacities and by faster relaxation of the bath system . thus @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the characteristic relaxation times of the bath and the spin system respectively . in general all the temperatures @xmath21 are different . due to couplings to additional reservoirs the @xmath22 may even be time dependent . thus the @xmath23 - together with @xmath24 - are preset quantities .",

    "is an approximation which requires this presumption for the @xmath24 . ]    with these requirements there is no need for an explicit specification of the bath hamiltonian @xmath26 and the bath operators @xmath27 .",
    "as shown below , it is just the absorptive part @xmath28 of the dynamic bath susceptibility @xmath29\\rangle_b\\ ; e^ { i\\omega t } \\mathrm{d}t \\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which enters the calculation for values @xmath30 .",
    "expectation values with respect to @xmath31 are represented by @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the liouvillian defined by @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath35 holds , which can always be achieved by a renormalization of the terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "note that @xmath36 implies @xmath37 and the first term of the low frequency expansion of @xmath38 can be used . apart from interesting exceptions ( compare @xcite )",
    "this yields in the generic case @xmath39 where the constant of proportionality may depend on @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a fixed but arbitrary set of variables which are functions of the ising spins @xmath42 .",
    "this set is assumed to give a sufficient dynamical description of some physical question and will be called observation level according to @xcite . without further specification of the observation level at this stage the general approach of robertson @xcite",
    "is applied employing the usual perturbation treatment up to the second order in @xmath43 and the standard markovan approximation @xcite .",
    "as all variables @xmath44 commute with @xmath45 this leads to @xmath46 \\rangle_t\\quad ,   \\quad u(t ,",
    "t-\\tau)= \\exp ( -i\\tau[l^s(t)+l^b ] ) { \\end{equation}}where the liouvillians   $    l^s   $ and     $ l^b $   are    associated to $   { \\cal   h}^s $ and to $   { \\cal h}^b $ , respectively . the time dependent expectation values $ \\langle \\ldots \\rangle_t $ are performed with the generalized canonical statistical operator   { \\begin{equation}\\label}{54 }   r_t = r^s_t\\ : r^b   \\quad   \\mathrm{with}\\quad r^s_t={\\exp (   v ) } /   { { \\rm tr_s}\\;\\exp(v   ) } \\quad   \\textrm{and}\\quad   v=\\sum_k \\lambda^k_t a^k \\quad\\ ] ] where the time dependent lagrange parameters @xmath47 are implicitly determined by @xmath48 note that the system of eqs.([50 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) represent a closed set of nonlinear differential eqs . for the expectation values @xmath49 and the lagrange parameters @xmath50 .",

    "obviously all of the above requirements are satisfied .",
    "the second observation level is spanned by all ising spins @xmath67 and by the interaction @xmath68 .",
    "this choice implies that all thermal equilibrium states of the spin system are possible initial states .",

    "have been used since the early days in spin glass research @xcite .",
    "moreover the author himself had used such equations to find numerically the solutions of the static tap equations @xcite .",
    "note that eq.([91 ] ) implies relaxation to the static tap equations independent of the values of @xmath116 .",
    "thus the phenomenological equations can be used instead of the microscopic results to calculate static properties and these results justify the procedure used in @xcite to calculate the solutions of the tap equations .    for all dynamic quantities , however , the full form of @xmath116 has to be used .",
    "first examples are the dynamic susceptibility and the relaxation function as presented already in @xcite .",
    "note that a result of @xcite , the frequency - dependent shift of the cusp temperature of the real part of the susceptibility , is basically a consequence of @xmath116 . in this context",
    "the general result @xcite should be recalled that the linear approximation of the robertson theory leads the mori theory .",
    "consequently all the linear response theory results of @xcite can also be obtained from the of eqs.([90 ] ) and ( [ 91 ] ) by linearizing around the thermal equilibrium which can easily be checked .",
    "the consequences of the results of this letter are further illustrated on simple physical situations .",
    "first one singular spin coupled to a bath with temperature @xmath114 is considered .",
    "this implies no spin spin interaction at all .",
    "both the master equation and the standard system approach of this letter leads to the equation of motion @xmath117 for the magnetization @xmath118 with @xmath119 . for a static field the magnetization @xmath118 relaxes to the equilibrium value @xmath120 with the well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath121 .",
    "note the latter result is not found if instead of eq.([g ] ) the usual ad hoc assumptions of the kinetic ising model are used .",
    "next the original system of glauber , an infinite chain of ising spins with next neighbor ferromagnetic interactions is considered which is coupled to one bath with a temperature @xmath122 .",
    "the transition rates ( [ g ] ) satisfy the detailed balance relation and therefore relaxation to the thermal equilibrium results within the master equation approach .",
    "the same consequences apply for the standard system approach .",
    "indeed the equilibrium values of the lagrange parameter @xmath123 and @xmath124 describe a fixed point of the eqs.([66 ] ) and ( [ 67 ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that nether the transition rates ( [ g ] ) nor the details of distribution functions @xmath125 enter in thermal expectation values .",
    "note that these arguments apply to all undriven ising system which are coupled to one singular bath .",
    "thus all this systems relax to thermal equilibrium taking in account that the fixed points are always stable .",
    "this can easily be checked by a linear stability analysis .    for situations ,",
    "however , where two or more bathes with different temperatures @xmath126 are present the values of stationary solutions depend on the transition rates or on the details of the distribution functions @xmath96 .",
    "thus for example the non equilibrium stationary states of schmittmann and schmser @xcite can not be accepted as a realistic solution for their interesting model of a one dimensional ising chain coupled to two bath systems as the analysis is based on the phenomenological rates and not on the physical rates .",
    "finally it is pointed out that the results of the present work will always effect the details of the dynamic evolution apart form situations where the hight temperature approximation can be used . in general more complicated expressions",
    "are found compared to the phenomenological results .",
    "this even applies to the original model of glauber . for this kinetic ising model the equations of motion for the time correlation function",
    "partly separate which enables the explicit calculation of the complete dynamics .",
    "such a simplifying separation does not occur for the microscopical master equation .",
    "thus the solution is not known and is hard to find as already pointed out in @xcite .",
