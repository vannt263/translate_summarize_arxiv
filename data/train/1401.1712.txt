    "<S> this surprising perron - frobenius broadcasting @xcite , can thus be used to faithfully ( in the asymptotic limit above ) broadcast the classical message @xmath84 through the environment macro - fractions , however noisy they are .    _ </S>",
    "<S> final remarks . </S>",
    "<S> _ there is one straightforward generalization to many parties . </S>",
    "<S> consider several spheres , each with its own photonic environment , separated by distances @xmath85 , @xmath86 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ soft ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is then a product of ( [ u ] ) , e.g. for two spheres @xmath87 , where @xmath88 are the spheres positions and @xmath89 are the corresponding scattering matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic state ( [ b - state ] ) provides objectivisation of classical correlations @xcite , e.g. @xmath90 , measurable by observers who have an access to photons originating from all the spheres .    in the studied model , as in the majority of decoherence models , </S>",
    "<S> the system - environment interaction is of a form : [ hint ] h_int = g a_s _ k=1^n x_e_k , where @xmath91 is a coupling constant and @xmath92 are some observables on the system and the environments respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenbasis of @xmath93 becomes the pointer basis  </S>",
    "<S> it is arguably put by hand by the choice of the form ( [ hint ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is then an interesting question if there are more general interactions , without an a priori priviledged basis , which nevertheless lead to an asymptotic formation of spectrum broadcast states ( [ br2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it would be extremely interesting to test our findings experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our central object , the broadcast state ( [ br2 ] ) , is in principle directly observable through e.g. quantum state tomography  a well developed , successful , and widely used technique @xcite .    </S>",
