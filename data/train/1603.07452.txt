    "the recently reported direct detection of gravitational waves by advanced ligo @xcite counts as one of the most important discoveries in physics . in his seminal 1916 paper @xcite ,",
    "einstein was able to show that a linearized version of his field equations exhibits wave - like solutions .",
    "gravitational waves are generated whenever masses in a gravitational system are accelerated such that certain derivatives of multipole moments of the system are nonvanishing @xcite .",
    "for example , this concerns nonspherical supernova explosions , rotations of binary pulsars , and black - hole mergers .",
    "after all , the source of the signal gw150914 detected by advanced ligo is considered to have been the merger of two black holes .",
    "einstein thought that gravitational waves were a mere theoretical manifestation of local lorentz invariance in general relativity but he did not have any confidence in their experimental discovery .",
    "however , even before their direct detection by advanced ligo , the majority of the physics community had already believed in gravitational waves . observing the hulse - taylor binary over several decades",
    "confirmed that the measured energy loss of this system was in excellent agreement with calculations based on gravitational waves in general relativity @xcite .",
    "therefore , this result had already been considered as an indirect evidence for gravitational waves .",
    "such waves are tiny ripples that propagate through spacetime and generate strain .",
    "typical amplitudes far away from the source are smaller than one part in @xmath0 .",
    "hence , their direct detection is a great technological challenge .",
    "the signal gw150914 was only possible to be detected with an interferometer whose arm length is several kilometers and which , apart from that , involves various sophisticated setups to reduce vibrations , thermal noise , etc . the direct detection of gravitational waves can be considered as a lucky chance for the field of lorentz symmetry violation .",
    "it will allow for obtaining new constraints on lorentz violation in the gravity sector as well as for massive elementary particles .",
    "few days after the announcement by advanced ligo the first paper appeared placing tight bounds on lorentz violation in the pure - gravity sector @xcite of the standard - model extension ( sme ) .",
    "the sme is the most general lorentz - violating framework .",
    "it comprises all possible lorentz - violating operators of the standard model of elementary particles @xcite and general relativity @xcite .",
    "its minimal version @xcite involves all power - counting renormalizable terms , whereas the nonminimal sme @xcite contains all operators of mass dimension @xmath1 . for a review on various aspects of lorentz violation and the sme ,",
    "consult @xcite .    in this letter a simple model for a lorentz - violating background field , which is deformed by a propagating gravitational wave , is introduced .",
    "the model is based on the lagrangian of a classical , relativistic , pointlike particle related to the sme @xmath2 coefficients , which are _ cpt_-odd and of mass dimension one . for the past few years research has been performed on how a classical - particle description can be obtained from the field theory language of the sme .",
    "this was initiated by the paper @xcite covering many cases of the minimal fermion sector .",
    "subsequent works complemented our knowledge of the minimal fermion sector @xcite where some articles discussed the nonminimal fermion sector @xcite as well as the photon sector @xcite .",
    "these classical lagrangians are especially suitable when describing lorentz - violating particles on curved manifolds , which is why we will use this method here .    the paper is organized as follows . in the most important properties of gravitational waves",
    "are reviewed . in this context , the specific classical lagrangian , which forms the foundation of the studies , is introduced and coupled to the metric perturbation induced by the gravitational wave . in we consider a particular model based on this lagrangian .",
    "it is characterized by a vector field that violates lorentz invariance spontaneously and that is perpendicular with respect to the propagation direction of the gravitational wave . based on results in the context of the gravitational sme ,",
    "the geodesic equations for a massive particle are obtained .",
    "subsequently , this set of differential equations is solved numerically in .",
    "first of all , a solution is obtained for hypothetical numerical parameters to allow for a convenient and transparent discussion of the physical implications .",
    "section [ sec : observable - signals ] is dedicated to obtaining an observable signal from the numerical solutions of the geodesic equations for a realistic interferometric setup such as advanced ligo .",
    "this places us into a position to derive a new constraint on lorentz - violation in the fermion sector . in",
    "we discuss explicit lorentz violation in a gravitational - wave metric from the perspective of finsler geometry .",
    "thereby , an interesting observation is made with regards to the geodesic equations .",
    "finally , the results are concluded on in . throughout the paper ,",
    "natural units are used with @xmath3 unless otherwise stated .",
    "gravitational waves are solutions of the linearized einstein equations . to solve those equations it is reasonable to separate the curved spacetime metric @xmath4 into the minkowski metric @xmath5 and a piece @xmath6 that comprises all curvature effects : @xmath7 the einstein equations can be linearized in the weak - field limit , which translates to the claim that @xmath8 .",
    "it is possible to simplify the resulting linearized equations drastically on the foundation of diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity .",
    "this means that there is a set of gauge transformations that do not change the einstein equations . a particular gauge choice ,",
    "which is a combination of the lorentz gauge and the transverse - traceless gauge @xcite , leads to a wave equation for @xmath6 that has the following solution :    [ eq : metric - perturbation - gravitational - wave ] @xmath9 \\\\[2ex ] \\pi^{(+)}_{\\mu\\nu}&=\\begin{pmatrix } 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}_{\\mu\\nu}\\,,\\quad \\pi^{(\\times)}_{\\mu\\nu}=\\begin{pmatrix } 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}_{\\mu\\nu}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the latter has been restricted to its real part . here",
    "@xmath10 is the wave vector , @xmath11 are the coordinates , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are called the strain amplitudes .",
    "recall that the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave is characterized by its electric and magnetic field strength vectors whose magnitudes change periodically .",
    "an analog vectorial picture is not valid for gravitational waves since the latter are perturbations of the metric , which is a two - tensor .",
    "therefore , gravitational waves can be understood as metric perturbations whose amplitudes @xmath12 , @xmath13 vary periodically . when a gravitational wave propagates through spacetime this leads to what is known as strain .",
    "in analogy to electromagnetic waves , these tiny ripples in spacetime can have two different polarizations , which are denoted as ( + ) and ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "each of those is described by a particular metric perturbation @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "both matrices are traceless due to the choice of the transverse - traceless gauge .",
    "the notation for these polarizations results from the effect that they have on a ring of massive particles .",
    "for the ( + ) polarization this ring is distorted to an ellipse whose eccentricity changes periodically .",
    "both semiaxes are oriented to point along the horizontal and vertical axes of a cartesian coordinate system . for the @xmath17 polarization the behavior of",
    "the ring is similar but the semiaxes of the ellipse are rotated by @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "the gravity sector itself is assumed to be standard , i.e. , the form of a gravitational wave is given by with the usual dispersion relation @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , gravitational waves shall propagate with the speed of light . in @xcite modifications of the latter dispersion relation based on the pure - gravity sector of the sme",
    "are considered leading to tight constraints on both minimal and nonminimal coefficients based on gw150914 . in the current letter ,",
    "lorentz violation is taken to reside in the minimal fermion sector only .",
    "we consider an observer frame with nonzero @xmath2 coefficients , i.e. , the fermion action reads as follows @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a spinor field , @xmath22 are the standard dirac matrices based on the clifford algebra , @xmath23 is the fermion mass , and @xmath24 is the unit matrix in spinor space .",
    "lorentz violation is encoded in the nonzero observer four - vector @xmath25 .",
    "note that the lagrange density , as it stands , is defined in minkowski spacetime .",
    "thereby , we use the signature @xmath26 of the minkowski metric @xmath5 in contrast to the majority of the literature related to general relativity . to study the effect of a gravitational wave on particles",
    "subject to such a particular type of lorentz violation it is reasonable to resort to an analog , classical description .",
    "indeed , there is a procedure that allows for mapping a field theory such as to a classical - particle description .",
    "for the sme the relevant tools were set up in @xcite with further studies performed in a subsequent series of papers @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian describing a classical , relativistic , pointlike particle subject to the @xmath2 coefficients was derived in @xcite .",
    "it is given as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the four - velocity of the classical particle .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath29 is defined in minkowski spacetime , i.e. , each pair of four - vectors is contracted with @xmath5 and the background vector @xmath25 is taken to be constant . the model considered",
    "will be based on this particular lagrangian for several reasons .",
    "first , it is the simplest one obtained in the context of the sme , which makes its study practical from a technical point of view .",
    "second , the @xmath2 coefficients are particularly interesting in gravity since possible effects from these coefficients can not be measured in minkowski spacetime using only a single fermion species .",
    "the reason is that those can be eliminated by a field redefinition , which is why they can , in principle , be very large in minkowski spacetime  @xcite .",
    "this changes in a gravitational background where a global field redefinition is not possible . with the procedure of minimal coupling",
    ", the lagrangian of can be promoted to a curved spacetime .",

    "the notion of a constant vector or tensor field loses its meaning .",
    "explicit lorentz violation is then incompatible with a curved spacetime manifold based on riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the modified energy - momentum conservation law clashes with the geometrical bianchi identities . since explicit lorentz violation",

    "the large gravitational field of the earth ( in comparison to a gravitational - wave perturbation ) flows into these constraints .",
    "furthermore , a change of the wave length in the ligo interferometer is suppressed by the square of the small quantity @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the ligo setup is not very sensitive to the particular lorentz - violating model considered , which is why the constraints in @xcite are much better than .",
    "as was mentioned in , explicit lorentz violation in a curved gravitational background clashes with some of the basic properties of riemannian geometry such as the bianchi identities . therefore , a reasonable alternative to spontaneous lorentz violation could be to resort to a more general geometrical framework such as finsler geometry .",
    "to do so we have to propose an _ ansatz _ for an explicitly lorentz - violating vector field .",
    "it is a reasonable assumption for this background field to adopt at least some of the symmetries or properties of the curved spacetime where it is defined in .",
    "for example , in a curved , isotropic spacetime such as the schwarzschild metric it is rational to assume a lorentz - violating background field to be spherically symmetric as well , cf .",

    "@xmath96 is furnished such that @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , the leading sine contribution in its fourier expansion is supposed to vanish . a nonzero phase shift in the argument of the cosine function",
    "could be introduced to model a delayed response of the lorentz - violating background field to the metric perturbation .",
    "however , the response shall take place instantaneously setting the phase shift to zero .",
    "this whole argument shows that for explicit lorentz violation a range of assumptions have to be made on how the lorentz - violating vector field could look like .",
    "for spontaneous lorentz violation , the form of @xmath25 follows directly from field equations .",
    "next , we consider @xmath98 of with an explicitly lorentz - violating vector field @xmath25 inserted .",
    "a wick rotation - type procedure then makes @xmath98 a riemann - finsler structure @xcite . for a textbook treatment of finsler geometry",
    "we refer to @xcite . since @xmath98 involves a pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath4 it must be treated as a pseudo - riemann - finsler structure , i.e. , as the integrand of a generalized path length functional on a curved spacetime with an intrinsic preferred direction .",
    "the knowledge of such finsler spacetimes is not as elaborate as for finsler spaces .",
    "certain properties of finsler spacetimes , e.g. , causality are quite subtle .",
    "nevertheless , finsler spacetimes were studied in the series of papers @xcite , amongst others .",

    "any finsler space has an additional metric associated to it , which is called the finsler metric @xmath99 .",
    "note that the latter is denoted with a tilde to distinguish it from the ( pseudo)-riemannian metric @xmath4 .",

    "they are defined such as in riemannian geometry but they now involve the finsler metric : @xmath101 we do not consider any torsion effects , which makes the christoffel symbols symmetric in the lower pair of indices : @xmath102 . in finsler geometry ,",
    "the usual geodesic equations are generalized with the finslerian affine connection . in general , for a geodesic @xmath103 that is parameterized using an arbitrary parameter @xmath42 they read @xmath104 note that in the majority of the literature on ( finsler ) geometry , geodesics are assumed to be parameterized such that the speed of a particle traveling along the geodesic remains constant .",
    "hence , the finsler structure , which is the integrand of the path length functional and , therefore , can be understood as a generalized speed , does not change .",
    "the interpretation is different for a lagrangian , which is a pseudo - finsler structure . nevertheless , there are parameterizations leaving @xmath29 unchanged along the geodesic , which renders the first term in the usual four - acceleration . in the lorentz - invariant case",
    "such a parameterization is possible using proper time .",
    "however , when there are lorentz - violating contributions a suitable choice is more involved .",
    "so even if we still parameterize a geodesic with proper time , which is what we want to do , it is not granted that this is a constant - speed parameterization .",
    "hence , the geodesic equations will be taken as they stand in .",
    "based on the lagrangian of , both the finsler metric and the finsler affine connection coefficients can be computed for an @xmath25 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "it is reasonable to carry out all computations with computer algebra .",

    "( [ eq : geodesic - equations - model ] ) reveals that they almost correspond to each other .",
    "the only differences are the contributions that involve @xmath107 and @xmath108 directly and not their derivatives",
    ". however , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : geodesic - equation - x - component - finsler ] ) , ( [ eq : geodesic - equation - y - component - finsler ] ) can be solved for the accelerations and be inserted into , which eliminates all terms dependent on @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "terms that involve products @xmath110 are neglected since those are of higher order .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : geodesic - equations - model - finsler ] ) , as they stand , are valid for a general explicitly lorentz - violating vector field @xmath25 with nonzero components @xmath107 ,",
    "@xmath108 , i.e. , the particular _ ansatz _ of has not been employed so far .",
    "it is an interesting observation that the geodesic equations for spontaneous and explicit lorentz violation treated in the realm of finsler geometry are equal at leading order in lorentz violation and strain .",
    "choosing @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the _ ansatz _ of corresponds to .",
    "we emphasize again that both vector fields have completely different interpretations .",
    "the choice of is obtained from a field equation for @xmath25 , whereas all properties of must be put in by hand .    in the context of spontaneous lorentz violation ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is covariantly conserved on - shell , i.e. , when the geodesic equations ( [ eq : geodesic - equations - model ] ) for the particle and the field equations for the lorentz - violating background field are fulfilled .",
    "the geodesic equations ( [ eq : geodesic - equations - model - finsler ] ) for explicit lorentz violation correspond to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : geodesic - equations - model ] ) at first order in lorentz violation .",
    "so the lately mentioned choice for the explicitly lorentz - violating vector field is an approximation to the @xmath25 obtained from spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor must be covariantly conserved for solutions of the geodesic equations based on this particular explicitly lorentz - violating @xmath25 .",
    "the latter must then also be consistent with the bianchi identities at first order in lorentz violation .",
    "we will elaborate on theoretical questions of this and of similar kind in a follow - up work .",
    "in this letter , a simple model for a classical particle subject to lorentz violation was on the focus .",
    "the model was based on the point - particle lagrangian that is linked to the @xmath2 coefficients of the minimal standard - model extension ( sme ) . in light of the recent direct detection of gravitational waves by advanced ligo ,",
    "the particle was coupled to a gravitational - wave metric perturbation . by doing so ,",
    "the leading - order geodesic equations were obtained and solved numerically .",
    "in contrast to the lorentz - invariant theory , a single particle exhibits a ( periodic ) accelerated motion caused by combined effects of the gravitational wave and the lorentz - violating background field .",
    "the numerical solutions were used to compute a constraint on lorentz violation from the signal detected by advanced ligo . by mischance , this constraint lies many orders of magnitude above current constraints from tests of the weak - equivalence principle on earth and on satellites .",
    "this is due to the extremely weak field of a gravitational wave and due to a quadratic suppression of the observable signal .",
    "this paper shall be the base for further applications of point - particle lagrangians for the sme fermion sector in the context of gravitational - wave physics .",
    "presumably , the phenomenological approach discussed here is not very suitable to obtain tight constraints on fermionic controlling coefficients .",
    "however , there is a plethora of theoretical questions to be answered .",
    "first , for explicit lorentz violation , the implications of a nonconserved energy - momentum tensor at the source for gravitational waves will be a worthwhile issue to investigate .",
    "we will then explore whether and how the clash with the geometrical bianchi identities can be circumvented within the realm of finsler geometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite for preliminary studies in the photon sector ) .",
    "second , models based on alternative lagrangians for fermions can be studied to gain more theoretical insight , e.g. , the bipartite case of the @xmath113 coefficients @xcite .",
    "it will also be interesting to find out if for such alternative sets of coefficients the geodesic equations for spontaneous lorentz violation and explicit lorentz violation in the realm of finsler geometry correspond to each other at first order in lorentz violation . by doing so",
    ", we could find out whether this is a general property or specific for the @xmath2 coefficients only .",
