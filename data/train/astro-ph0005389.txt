    "several lines of evidence support the notion that sgrs are magnetars  young , slowly - rotating neutron stars with intense ( @xmath1 g ) magnetic fields ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995,1996 ) .",
    "firstly , all sgrs presently known are located close to or within a supernova remnant .",
    "sgr  1900 + 14 lies just outside the remnant g42.8 + 0.6 ( vasisht et al .",

    "finally , the measurement of high spin - down rates in two sgrs ( kouveliotou et al .  1998a,1999",
    "; marsden , rothschild & lingenfelter 1999 ) are suggestive of a neutron star spinning down via relativistic wind emission .    following the precise localization and discovery of coherent 5.16-s x - ray pulsations from sgr  1900 + 14 during an intense outburst in 1998 ( hurley et al .",
    "1998 ) , we undertook a high - sensitivity search for radio pulsations from sgr  1900 + 14 using the upgraded arecibo telescope .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we report on these observations and discuss their implications .",
    "the pulsar search is described in  [ sec : search ] . although we did not detect the 5.16-s periodicity",
    ", we did find a young radio pulsar , j1907 + 0918 , located 2 arcmin from sgr  1900 + 14 . in ",
    "[ sec:1907 ] we summarize 15 months of arecibo timing observations of psr  j1907 + 0918 . as we discuss in  [ sec : disc ] , our discovery of psr  j1907 + 0918 is the latest in a number of independent pieces of evidence which challenges the proposed association between sgr  1900 + 14 and g42.8 + 0.6 .",
    "in early june 1998 we observed sgr  1900 + 14 using the arecibo telescope seven days after the source became active following a long period of quiescence .",
    "coordinated observations of the outburst by ulysses and batse / cgro resulted in an accurate localization of the source position ( @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ) kindly provided to us in advance of publication by c.  kouveliotou .",
    "this allowed us to make deep search observations .",
    "the arecibo search for radio pulsations was carried out with the penn state pulsar machine ( pspm ) , a filterbank which records the total - power outputs of the receiver over @xmath4-khz frequency channels every 80 @xmath0s .",
    "we collected continuous pspm data in search mode for 1380 s using the 430-mhz line feed ( june 10 ) and the gregorian l - narrow receiver at 1410 mhz ( june 11 ) .",
    "the error in the localized position ( a 3 arcmin@xmath5 error ellipse ) was sufficiently small to require only a single telescope pointing at each of the two frequencies ( the 3-db width of the arecibo beam is 10 arcmin at 430 mhz and 3 arcmin at 1410 mhz ) .",
    "these data were searched for the presence of periodic signals using software developed for a recent pulsar survey with the effelsberg radio telescope ( lorimer et al .",
    "the search explores the three - dimensional parameter space defined by pulse period , pulse duty cycle and dispersion measure by de - dispersing and fourier transforming the raw data before searching for statistically significant harmonic features in the amplitude spectra .",
    "the best candidates are folded in the time domain to produce diagnostic plots which are saved for later inspection .    to estimate the sensitivity of these searches , following dewey et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , we calculate the minimum flux density @xmath6 required for a detection as follows : @xmath7 here the factor @xmath8 reflects losses due to hardware limitations , @xmath9 is the threshold signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the receiver and sky noise temperatures ( k ) , @xmath12 is the effective antenna gain ( k jy@xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the number of polarizations summed , @xmath15 khz @xmath16 mhz is the total observing bandwidth , @xmath17 s is the integration time , @xmath18 is the detected pulse width and @xmath19 is the pulse period . for our 430-mhz search",
    "we can insert the above values along with @xmath20 k , @xmath21 k , @xmath22 k jy@xmath13 to find @xmath23 mjy . for the 1410-mhz search , @xmath24 k , @xmath25 k , @xmath26",
    "k jy@xmath13 so that @xmath27 mjy . in both these cases , we have assumed that @xmath28 .",
    "note also that both the 430-mhz and 1410-mhz observations were carried out at necessarily high zenith angles ( @xmath29 ) so that the quoted antenna gains are lower than those applicable to observations closer to the zenith ( see http://www.naic.edu/aomenu.htm for up - to - date telescope information ) .",
    "these search observations were carried out as part of a larger search for pulsars in supernova remnants at arecibo . as part of this project",
    ", we undertook a number of calibration observations with the pspm for pulsars with well - known flux densities and pulse widths .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios predicted from equation [ equ : smin ] compare well with those obtained in practice and give us confidence in the above flux limits obtained from our blind search .",
    "our search was carried out before the announcement of the 5.16-s periodicity by hurley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . following this discovery , and",
    "shitov s ( 1999 ) detection at 111 mhz , we de - dispersed and folded both sets of search data at the predicted topocentric period to look for evidence of a pulsed signal .",
    "we found no convincing evidence for pulsar - like profiles above a signal - to - noise threshold of 6 .",
    "this effectively reduces the above limits from the blind periodicity searches by a factor of 6/8 to @xmath30 mjy and @xmath31 mjy .",
    "shitov , pugachev & kutuzov ( 2000 ) report a pulse width of 100 ms for the 5.16-s radio pulsations from sgr  1900 + 14 observed at 111 mhz .",
    "based on the above sensitivity estimations , such a pulsed signal would be detectable down to a flux - density limit of 150 @xmath0jy at 430 mhz and 30 @xmath0jy at 1410 mhz .",
    "we note that these upper limits , together with shitov et al.s flux measurement of sgr  1900 + 14 as a 50-mjy radio pulsar at 111 mhz , constrain the power - law index of the radio spectrum to be steeper than 3 .",
    "clearly , further radio observations at lower frequencies are required to confirm or refute the 111-mhz detection reported by shitov et .",
    "during the analysis of our 1410-mhz search observations towards sgr  1900 + 14 we found a very promising 113-ms pulsar candidate .",
    "subsequent 1410-mhz observations made in september 1998 confirmed the existence of the pulsar ( j1907 + 0918 ) and identified its true period to be 226 ms ( xilouris et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in order to accurately determine the spin and astrometric properties of psr  j1907 + 0918 ,",
    "we have been carrying out regular timing measurements using the pspm since october 1998 .",
    "a preliminary ephemeris , based on the discovery and confirmation observations , was used to predict the apparent pulse period initially .",
    "this period was sufficiently accurate to be used by the pspm in timing mode to fold the incoming data from each of the 128 frequency channels for typically 90 s before saving the profiles to disk .",
    "the individual frequency channels were later de - dispersed to produce a time - tagged integrated pulse profile for each 90-s observation . for each of these scans , the mean pulse time of arrival ( toa ) at the observatory",
    "was then determined by cross correlating the profile with a high signal - to - noise template ( for further details , see taylor 1992 ) .    the tempo software package ( which is freely available at http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) and the de200 planetary ephemeris were then used to correct these topocentric toas for the earth s motion around the sun and transform them to the frame of the solar system barycenter before fitting them to a simple isolated pulsar spin - down model ( see e.g.  manchester & taylor 1977 ) .",
    "multiple passes of the toas through tempo were required in order to minimize the model minus observed timing residuals and resolve any pulse numbering ambiguities .",
    "the resulting ephemeris based on observations spanning a 15-month baseline between october 1998 and january 2000 yields a sub - arcsecond position and highly accurate spin - down parameters which are presented in table [ tab:1907 ] .",
    "the post - fit timing residuals for this ephemeris are free from systematic trends at the level of 108 @xmath0s rms .",
    "= 7truecm    from the spin parameters of psr  j1907 + 0918 , we infer a dipole surface magnetic field strength of @xmath32 g and a characteristic age of only 38 kyr .",
    "this low characteristic age places j1907 + 0918 in the youngest 3% of known galactic radio pulsars .",
    "many pulsars with similar characteristic ages have relatively flat radio spectra ( johnston 1990 ; lorimer et al .",
    "1995 ) and are strongly polarized sources at radio frequencies above 1 ghz ( von hoensbroech 1999 ) .    in order to investigate the emission properties of psr  j1907 + 0918 , in october and november 1998 we carried out a series of quasi - simultaneous multi - frequency observations at arecibo using the 430-mhz line feed , along with the gregorian receivers centered at 1410 , 2380 and 5000 mhz .",
    "we used the arecibo - berkeley pulsar processor ( abpp ) for these observations .",
    "the abpp is a 32-channel coherent - dispersion - removal machine capable of high - precision timing and polarimetry ( for details see backer et al .",
    "1997 and http://www.naic.edu/@xmath33abpp ) which allowed us to carry out high - quality observations spanning a bandwidth of up to 35 mhz .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pprof ] we present a high signal - to - noise polarization profile of psr  j1907 + 0918 based on abpp observations carried out at 1410 mhz .",
    "the degree of circular polarization in this profile is 58% , making this the pulsar with the highest known degree of circular polarization at 1410 mhz .",
    "psr  j1907 + 0918 is ideally suited as a calibrator for future pulsar polarimetry observations . as can be seen from the scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : pprof ] , the pulse duty cycle of j1907 + 0918 is extremely small , less than 2% at observing frequencies above 1 ghz .",
    "fewer than 2% of all known pulsars have such a narrow pulse . at 430 mhz , however , the lowest frequency that we have data for , the profile appears to be broadened due to multi - path scattering .",
    "fitting the profile to a truncated exponential function , we determine a scattering time - scale at 430-mhz of 17 ms .",
    "the flux densities @xmath34 at each frequency @xmath35 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "fitting these to a power law of the form @xmath36 yields a mean spectral index @xmath37 .",
    "only two pulsars out of 260 listed by lorimer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have flatter spectra . in summary , based on the timing and emission properties of psr  j1907 + 0918 , we conclude that it is most likely a young radio pulsar .",
    "although our radio search for the 5.16-s pulsations from sgr  1900 + 14 was unsuccessful , the discovery of psr  j1907 + 0918 has important implications for the origins of sgr  1900 + 14 and its proposed association with the supernova remnant g42.8 + 0.6 .      the angular separation between psr  j1907 + 0918 and sgr  1900 + 14 is @xmath38 arcmin .",
    "apart from globular cluster pulsars and double neutron star binaries , this is the closest pair of neutron stars on the plane of the sky .",
    "either the two stars are physically close to each other ( at the dispersion - measure distance of j1907 + 0918 , 7.7 kpc , the projected separation is only 5 pc ) , or they are at different distances and only appear close when seen in projection .    to investigate the case of a simple geometric projection , we require an estimate of the expected number of pulsars per unit area that would be detectable in our deep search .",
    "cordes & chernoff ( 1997 ) provide a number of useful analytic expressions for these purposes . starting from their equation ( 8) we find the mean search volume @xmath39 to be proportional to @xmath40 . here for simplicity we have neglected any strong period dependence upon the sensitivity ( reasonable for long - period pulsars ) and weighted the mean over a pulsar luminosity function of the form @xmath41 ( see e.g.  lorimer et al .",
    "1993 ) . under the simplest assumption that the number density of pulsars is approximately constant , the expected number of pulsars @xmath42 . to estimate the pulsar detection rate in our search we extrapolate the results of the current parkes multibeam survey of the galactic plane which is detecting about 1.5 pulsars deg@xmath43 within @xmath44 around the location of psr j1907 + 0918 on the galactic plane ( f.  camilo , private communication ) . under the above assumptions",
    ", we would expect a deep arecibo search of this part of the plane to detect around @xmath45 pulsars deg@xmath43 .",
    "since the width of the 1410-mhz beam is around 3.5 arcmin , this corresponds to about one pulsar detection every 60 telescope pointings .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to appeal to simple chance detection in this case where we have only made one pointing at 1410 mhz .    aside from simple probability calculations ,",
    "there is one other reason to believe that the apparent close angular proximity between psr  j1907 + 0918 and sgr  1900 + 14 is simply a projection effect .",
    "if we were to assume that the two neutron stars had a common binary origin , this would require a binary system in which both stars are sufficiently massive to undergo a supernova explosion .",
    "although theoretical arguments can be made to explain the close proximity of psr  b1853 + 01 and psr  b1854 + 00 ( wolzczan cordes & dewey 1991 ) i.e.  that both these neutron stars were formed from a massive binary system , the ages of the radio pulsars in this case differ by over 100 million years .",
    "the similar ages of sgr  1900 + 14 and psr  j1907 + 0918 ( see below ) would require the progenitor stars to have essentially identical main sequence lifetimes and hence masses .",
    "for example , to produce two neutron stars that differ in age by only @xmath46 yr , we estimate from eq .",
    "1.3.9 of shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) that main sequence stars of the order of 6 m@xmath47 would differ in their absolute initial mass by only 0.05 @xmath48 , somewhat unlikely given the mass ratio distributions of binary stars ( see e.g.  dewey & cordes 1987 and references therein ) .",
    "both on statistical and evolutionary grounds , we conclude that sgr  1900 + 14 and psr  j1907 + 0918 did not share a common origin .      as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec:1907 ] , j1907 + 0918 is clearly a young pulsar .",
    "given that plausible cases for an association with a supernova remnant can be made for several young radio pulsars with similar characteristic ages to j1907 + 0918 , it is appropriate to revisit the case for the association between sgr  1900 + 14 and the supernova remnant g42.8 + 0.6 following our discovery of psr  j1907 + 0918 .",
    "there are three possibilities to be considered : ( 1 ) sgr  1900 + 14 is the neutron star produced in the supernova explosion that produced g42.8 + 0.6 ; ( 2 ) psr  j1907 + 0918 is associated with g42.8 + 0.6 ; ( 3 ) neither of these neutron stars are associated with g42.8 + 0.6 .    in order to make a good case for _ any _ neutron star - supernova remnant association",
    ", the following criteria should be satisfied ( see kaspi 1996 ) : ( a ) the distances to both objects should agree ; ( b ) the ages of both objects should agree ; ( c ) the implied transverse velocity , based on the neutron star offset from the remnant center and the age , should be reasonable .",
    "we now review the current evidence for both sgr  1900 + 14 and psr  j1907 + 0918 in connection with what is known about g42.8 + 0.6 .",
    "\\(a ) distance estimates : psr  j1907 + 0918 is estimated to lie at 7.7 kpc based on its dispersion measure and assuming the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) galactic electron density model .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in this model is at least 25% .",
    "hurley et al .  ( 1999b ) estimate the distance to sgr  1900 + 14 to be 5.7 kpc based on a spectral analysis of _ asca _ data , although no estimate of the uncertainty in this measurement is quoted .",
    "the distance to g42.8 + 0.6 is commonly taken in the literature to be 5 kpc ( see e.g.  vasisht et al .",
    "whilst this appears to be in agreement with sgr  1900 + 14 , it should be stated that the latter distance was derived using the notoriously unreliable @xmath49@xmath50 relationship . a more recent @xmath49@xmath50 study places g42.8 + 0.6 at @xmath51 kpc ( case & bhattacharya 1998 ) .",
    "given the considerable uncertainties associated with this technique , it would obviously be premature to rule out an association between g42.8 + 0.6 and either of the two neutron stars in question . in this regard",
    ", we note that the recent discovery by vrba et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of a massive star cluster only 12 arcsec from sgr  1900 + 14 suggests that it may have been formed in this cluster rather than g42.8 + 0.6 .",
    "vrba et al .",
    "estimate the star cluster to lie at 14.5 kpc .",
    "\\(b ) age estimates : the ages of any non - historical supernova remnants are strongly coupled with their distances since absolute remnant sizes , along with assumptions about the expansion velocities are required to constrain the ages .",
    "hence the age of g42.8 + 0.6 is also subject to considerable uncertainty .",
    "vasisht et al .",
    "( 1994 ) quote an age of @xmath46 yr but , given the above range of distance estimates , this could easily be uncertain by factors of a few . for sgr  1900 + 14 , the traditional assumptions about dipolar spin - down are thought not to apply and the age is quite uncertain with current estimates of @xmath52 yr ( see e.g.  kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999 ) . for psr  j1907 + 0918",
    ", the 38-kyr characteristic age is probably indicative of its true age .",
    "this is somewhat model dependent since the age would be reduced if e.g.  the birth spin period of psr  j1907 + 0918 was close to its current value or even increased if the neutron star braking is less than that expected from pure magnetic dipole braking ( see e.g.  manchester & taylor 1977 ) . in summary , based on currently - available evidence we conclude that both neutron stars appear to be young enough to be considered as plausible candidates for an association with g42.8 + 0.6 .",
    "\\(c ) transverse speed estimates : both neutron stars lie about 20 arcmin from the center of g42.8 + 0.6 which implies a transverse velocity of @xmath53 km s@xmath13 to carry either of them to their present position . here",
    "@xmath54 is the distance in units of 7 kpc and @xmath55 is the age in units of @xmath46 yr .",
    "although the exact values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are highly uncertain , it is unlikely that they are such that the required velocity estimate is below 1000 km s@xmath13 . for either of the neutron stars , then , the implied transverse velocities would place them at the far extremes of the presently - observed distribution ( harrison , lyne & anderson 1993 ) . to ultimately test for an association between psr  j1907 + 0918 and g42.8 + 0.6 , and constrain the age of the pulsar ,",
    "a proper motion measurement is required .",
    "the predicted pulsar proper motion is @xmath56 mas yr@xmath13 .",
    "future vlbi proper motion measurements of psr  j1907 + 0918 , perhaps using arecibo - effelsberg - gbt are highly desirable .    to summarize , based on the currently - available information , we conclude that the proposed association between g42.8 + 0.6 and sgr  1900 + 14 is , contrary to frequent claims in the literature , far from secure since there is no reason against arguing equally strongly in favor of psr  j1907 + 0918 as being the neutron star produced in the supernova explosion rather than sgr  1900 + 14 .",
    "indeed , the additional possibility that neither of these young neutron stars is associated with g42.8 + 0.6 remains attractive at this stage ! as noted by gaensler ( 2000 ) , large positional offsets between neutron stars and supernova remnants are more likely a result of random line - of - sight alignments rather than genuinely associated high - velocity neutron stars .",
    "this may well be the case here and further observations ( e.g.  deeper multi - wavelength maps of the region and proper - motion measurements ) are clearly desirable to help resolve this most perplexing situation .",
    "we are grateful to chryssa kouveliotou for suggesting the radio search of sgr  1900 + 14 and for releasing the source coordinates in advance of publication .",
    "we thank alex wolszczan for making the pspm available to us and don backer for providing access to the abpp . without either of these instruments , the observations presented here would not have been possible .",
