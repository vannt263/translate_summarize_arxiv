    "quantum discord is the most well - known measure of non - classical correlations and is thought to differentiate quantum and classical systems  @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the minimum difference between two classically equivalent formulations of the mutual information between subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the shannon entropy when @xmath7 is described by a classical probability distribution , and is the von neumann entropy when @xmath7 describes a quantum system . in the quantum case",
    "the conditional entropy depends on the measurement basis , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a complete set of orthonormal projectors on @xmath10 such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the probability of observing outcome @xmath13 on system @xmath2 , and @xmath14/p_k$ ] is the state of system @xmath3 conditional on the measurement of system @xmath2 returning measurement outcome @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum discord , @xmath15 , thus reduces to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the reduced density matrix of system @xmath2 . in order to calculate this quantity ,",
    "full state knowledge is required in addition to a minimization over all possible projective measurements on subsystem @xmath2 .    while there is no analytical expression for the quantum discord of a general state , the discord for various sets of two - qubit states",
    "have been found  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the quantum discord for all two - qubit states has been reduced to the problem of solving a set of transcendental equations  @xcite .",
    "one of the results we report here is an expression for the qd in the final state of a two - qubit dqc1 algorithm that can be calculated with only the outcome of the dqc1 algorithm ( trace of the unitary ) and the initial polarization of the top register .    motivated by the difficultly in computing the qd , dakic , vedral and brukner  @xcite proposed the gqd , which is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the set of all zero discord states ( @xmath20 . )",
    "these can be written as @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is the square of the hilbert - schmidt norm of hermitian operators .",
    "note that the gqd , like the original quantum discord , is not symmetric in the subsystems , and @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    shortly after the proposal of this measure of quantum correlations , luo and fu  @xcite showed that equation   is equivalent to the minimization @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a projective measurement on system @xmath2 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the minimization can be performed analytically for arbitrary @xmath29-dimensional  @xcite and @xmath30-dimensional  @xcite states .",
    "the resulting expressions are in terms of quantities that are not efficiently experimentally accessible .",
    "however , a method for measuring a tight lower bound on the gqd has been recently proposed  @xcite , requiring only a constant number of measurements on up to four copies of the state . in this report",
    "we provide an analytical expression for the gqd of @xmath31-dimensional dqc1-states , and describe a dqc1-algorithm to efficiently estimate it .     along @xmath32 . at the conclusion of the circuit ,",
    "measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath34 result in the value of the real and imaginary components of the trace of the unitary , scaled by the value of the polarization of the first qubit . ]",
    "the dqc1 model of computation is an example of a mixed state quantum information processor  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ dqc1fig ] , this model has access to only one qubit with non - zero polarization , accompanied by a register of @xmath1 maximally mixed qubits .",
    "the computation consists of two gates : a hadamard on the top , single qubit register , followed by an @xmath1-qubit unitary on the bottom register that is controlled by the state of the top qubit .",
    "the final state of this simple algorithm is what we call the dqc1-state and can be written as @xmath35 expectation value measurements of the pauli matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 yield the real and imaginary values of the trace of the unitary : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . since calculating the trace of a unitary",
    "does not have a known efficient classical algorithm , a dqc1 computer is believed to be more powerful than its classical counterpart .    despite its apparent improvement over classical methods",
    ", dqc1 is known to have zero bipartite entanglement between the top and bottom registers and can only have a small amount of entanglement across any other bipartite splitting  @xcite .",
    "it can , however , have quantum correlations characterized by the quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed in two experiments to date : measurement of the discord in a two - qubit optics setup using full state tomography  @xcite , and a four - qubit nmr implementation that witnesses discord with a small number of experiments  @xcite .",
    "in order to find an expression for the geometric discord in a dqc1-state , let us write eqn .   as @xmath40 the first term , the purity of the state of the total system , is invariant under unitary transformations",
    ". therefore it can be calculated for the initial state , and only depends on the initial polarization of the top register : @xmath41 in order to calculate the other two terms , consider parameterizing the measurement on the top qubit as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 are real and @xmath47 $ ] ; and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "thus , the state after measurement is    @xmath49    for the dqc1-state , the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 are equivalent , and evaluate to @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the eigenphases of @xmath54 ( i.e. @xmath55 ) , and we have used @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we are left with the task of minimizing @xmath57 over the measurement parameters @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "examining first and second order derivatives of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath45 and @xmath60 , we find the optimal measurement parameters to be @xmath61 which reduces the gqd to @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , and can be evaluated with a dqc1-algorithm using back - to - back applications of the control-@xmath54 .",
    "the depth of the circuit that evaluates @xmath64 is at most double the one that evaluates @xmath65 , and therefore has the same efficiency of evaluation as the standard dqc1 algorithm .",
    "worth noting here that @xmath66 indicates that the optimal measurement is always in the transverse ( x - y ) plane of the bloch sphere , independent of the implemented unitary .",
    "also note that eqn .",
    "allows for the ability to experimentally evaluate the optimal measurement parameter @xmath67 using the same data collected for the evaluation of @xmath64 .    the gqd does not depend on the eigenvectors of the unitary , but rather the distribution of eigenphases",
    "this gives rise to classes of unitaries that generate the same gqd in a dqc1 circuit .",
    "for instance , reproducing a result from ref .",
    "@xcite , the set of unitaries that generate zero gqd ( and hence , zero qd ) will have @xmath68 , implying @xmath69 for some @xmath70 .",
    "this is possible if and only if the eigenphases of @xmath54 are @xmath71 . that is to say @xmath72 , where @xmath2 is a binary observable ( @xmath73 ) .    for a unitary drawn randomly according to the haar measure , its eigenphases",
    "are randomly distributed over the unit circle  @xcite .",
    "thus , for large @xmath1 , @xmath64 approaches zero and @xmath74 approaches its maximum value of @xmath75 , i.e. the gqd of a dqc1-state decreases exponentially with the number of qubits .",
    "this is in contrast to the average qd of a dqc1-state , which was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be independent of the number of qubits for large @xmath1 .",
    "we measure the quantum correlations , as quantified by the gqd , in a liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance implementation of the dqc1 algorithm .",
    "the qubits in nmr are ensembles of spin-1/2 nuclei . in this experiment",
    ", we use the four carbon-13 nuclei in the molecule trans - crotonic acid ( molecular information and hamiltonian parameters can be found in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "the experiment is implemented in a 16.7 t magnetic field bruker avance spectrometer , where , for carbon-13 nuclei ( @xmath76 ) at room temperature , the initial polarization of the thermal state is @xmath77 .",
    "the spins are manipulated with radio frequency pulses numerically generated using the grape algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the pulses are designed to have a fidelity of no less than 0.998 and are adjusted for non - linearities in the pulse generation and transmission by placing a pickup coil at the location of the sample and running a feedback loop to iteratively adjust the pulse shape for optimal transmission .    , normalized by @xmath78 , as a function of the measurement parameters @xmath45 and @xmath60 , for @xmath79 the output of the four - qubit dqc1 algorithm described in the text , and ( ii ) the geometric distance at the optimal measurement axis @xmath80 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the parameters that correspond to the optimal measurement .",
    "the experimental data point for the geometric discord of @xmath79 is shown on plot ( ii ) with error bars propagated from experimental uncertainties and the spectral fit . ]    for the particular instance of the dqc1 circuit in this experiment , we choose to implement one of the unitary matrices used for approximating the jones polynomial for braids with four strands  @xcite .",
    "this is a problem that completely encapsulates the power of the dqc1 model and is of interest in many fields of physics and math .",
    "the unitary has the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the dqc1-state , after the application of the control-@xmath54 , is known to have nonzero discord as witnessed in a recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "using eqn .  , we calculate the expected value of the gqd to be @xmath84 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_results ] , this is achieved for an optimal measurement with @xmath85 and @xmath86  rad .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig_results](ii ) is the experimental value of gqd in the dqc1-state , which is found to be @xmath87 by measuring the outcome of a dqc1 circuit with back - to - back applications of control-@xmath54 . for our experimental polarization ( @xmath88 ) ,",
    "the gqd in the final state is @xmath89 .",
    "in the case where the bottom register is a single qubit , we report an analytical expression for the qd of the dqc1-state , thereby contributing to the sets of two - qubit states for which the qd has been analytically solved . commencing from eqn .  , a minimization must be performed over the conditional entropy term , @xmath90 , which , in the case of a two - qubit dqc1-state , reduces to @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 and @xmath60 parameterize the measurement on the top qubit ( see the gqd case above ) .",
    "the minimization with respect to the measurement parameters @xmath45 and @xmath60 results in an optimal measurement characterized by @xmath95 this allows us to write the analytical expression for the qd of a two - qubit dqc1-state as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the binary entropy , and @xmath98 , which can be measured directly with a dqc1-algorithm .",
    "hence , the quantum discord of a two - qubit dqc1-state is zero for @xmath99 or @xmath100 , and maximum for @xmath101 .",
    "recall , from eqn .",
    ", that the gqd is zero for @xmath102 and maximum for @xmath103 .",
    "consider a general single - qubit unitary , expressed as @xmath104 , where @xmath105 $ ] is a rotation by @xmath106 about the unit vector in three dimensions @xmath107 , @xmath108 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath70 a global phase .",
    "it follows from @xmath109 that @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the qd and gqd are simultaneously maximum for @xmath112 , and simultaneously zero for @xmath113 , independent of the rotation axis @xmath114",
    ". examples of unitaries that can be written as @xmath115 rotations include bit - flip ( or not ) and hadamard .",
    "in this article we provided analytical expressions for the quantum correlations present in a dqc1-state in terms of experimentally accessible quantities . the geometric quantum discord can be computed for @xmath31-dimensional dqc1-states by implementing a dqc1 algorithm with a second application of the controlled unitary .",
    "the algorithm was experimentally demonstrated for a four - qubit liquid - state nmr implementation of the dqc1 model .",
    "we also showed , that for the special case of a two - qubit system , the quantum discord can be calculated using outcome of the dqc1-circuit ( the trace of the unitary ) .    for a typical dqc1-state , where the unitary is chosen uniformly at",
    "random according to the haar measure , we found that the geometric measure of discord scales with @xmath116 , in contrast to the quantum discord , which is known to be independent of @xmath1 ( for large @xmath1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the geometric quantum discord fails to completely quantify the correlations defined in the original entropic measure of quantum discord .",
    "finally , the work we have presented here further supports the suspicion that the apparent speedup exhibited by ( the dynamics of ) dqc1 is not necessarily captured by the geometric measure of quantum discord at the conclusion of the algorithm .",
