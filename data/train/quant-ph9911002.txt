    "when the question _ what is quantum chaos ? \" _ is thrown to us , we usually answer that no chaos is found in the quantum world . successively , we cite a kicked rotor model @xcite as a typical example .",
    "its classical dynamics is reduced to the standard map , which is a well - known chaotic system . for a classical ensemble of the initial state",
    ", the dispersion of the momenta eternally continues to increase as a result of a random walk . for",
    "a quantized kicked rotor , however , numerical simulation reveals that the diffusion in the momentum space begins to be saturated after a time scale , and the wave function is found to be finally localized @xcite@xcite .",
    "non - existence of quantum chaos can be also explained in general terms . for an isolated bound system ,",
    "the energy spectrum is discrete and almost periodicity appears in the evolution of the wave function even if the energy spectrum is coarse - grained@xcite .",
    "further , even if the potential is allowed to be temporally periodic , the wave function of the bound states also evolves almost periodically as long as the system is not resonant@xcite . in the proofs of these theorems , the property that the schrdinger equation is",
    "a kind of wave equation and a wave function is a superposition of the oscillating solutions works as fundamental one to quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore , quantum chaos is occasionally called _ quantum chaology _ or _ quantum psuedochaos_@xcite@xcite . as reflection of this situation , the energy level statistics and the complex structure of eigenfunctions in quantum non - linear systems @xcite rather than the dynamics have been searched for remnants of classical chaos .",
    "a decade ago , adachi , toda , and ikeda@xcite@xcite analyzed a system of coupled kick rotors which are classically chaotic .",
    "they found that localization of wave functions is broken in the model , while it appears when the coupling between the two rotors is absent .",
    "then , ikeda , adachi , and toda@xcite showed that a quantum system with helper degrees of freedom monotonously absorbs energy from the external field @xcite .",
    "recently , kubotani , okamura , and sakagami @xcite have proposed that the coupled kicked rotors also yield quantum noise with decaying correlation and break irreversibly the quantum coherence in contacted other degrees of freedom .",
    "these results show that redundant degrees of freedom may drastically alter the quantum dynamics .",
    "further , if we are allowed to apply the schrdinger equation to the whole universe , which is isolated and composed of infinitely many degrees of freedom , the fundamental questions arises : why some degrees of freedom behave classically and others quantum - mechanically ?",
    "why only the formers are able to behave chaotically or irreversibly ? these problems can not be answered straightforwardly @xcite . even without taking the ideal and mathematical limit of infinite degrees of freedom a priori",
    ", therefore , the quantum dynamics still involves important and interesting phenomena , although chaos in the exact sense , which is believed to contribute to irreversibility in the classical world@xcite , may not be present in the quantum world .",
    "according to the de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite , we can introduce a bundle of rigid trajectories which are consistently equivalent to a wave function . at first sight",
    ", the rigidity may be inconsistent with the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty principle makes a product of the expected values of canonically conjugated variables superior to the planck constant @xmath0 . in the copenhagen interpretation ,",
    "the relation is considered as inaccuracy of the simultaneous measurement of the conjugate variables . however , there is no mathematical inconsistency between the quantum trajectory picture and the time evolution of a wave function driven by the schrdinger equation as will be seen in section 2 .",
    "the de broglie - bohm interpretation considers quantum expectation values as statistically averaged ones and thus the apparent inconsistency is due to the confusion of the measurement theories on which we base the interpretation of the uncertainty relation .",
    "although the recovery of classical diffusion is confirmed by the previous works @xcite-@xcite , it does not necessarily mean that the classical dynamics is restored in quantum mechanics .",
    "the dynamics needs to be estimated more directly .",
    "the associated problems to be resolved are how nonlinearity work in quantum systems and what role redundant degrees of freedom play . in order to reveal them , in this paper",
    ", we propose to utilize quantum trajectories . for analysis of wave functions , indeed ,",
    "the wigner and husimi functions have been used @xcite .",
    "these projective representations of wave functions on the phase space can be compared with classical statistical distributions . however , since they do not follow the liouville equation , the comparison estimates only the correspondence or difference in the snap shot between the classical and quantum states .",
    "for the analysis of the dynamics , therefore , the description of quantum mechanics by trajectories is favorable , since the trajectories can be easily compared with classical orbits . by the quantum trajectory picture , even the standard notions of chaos , such as the lyapnov index and the ks entropy",
    "are also introduced naturally into the quantum world @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section 2 ,",
    "we introduce a coupled kicked rotator model as a multi - dimensional non - linear system and discuss the quantum picture of trajectories .",
    "we calculate the quantum trajectory of the system in the section 3 . in the section 4 ,",
    "we give the summary and discuss the results .",
    "the kicked rotor model was first introduced by chirikov@xcite . its property has been widely investigated both in classical and quantum mechanics , since it has the dynamics which is typical of nonlinear systems .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are an angle variable with period 2@xmath4 and its canonically conjugated action variable , respectively , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constant .",
    "the first term is quadratic with respect to the action variable @xmath3 and shows a nonharmonic oscillator .",
    "alternatively we can also consider it as the kinetic term with respect to the momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the second one shows the temporally periodic and instantaneous kick , whose strength and period are parameterized by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the classical dynamics is reduced to a discretized map .",
    "the variables @xmath7 at the discretized time @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are transformed as @xmath10 here @xmath11 indicates the time just after the kick .",
    "the transformation rule ( [ standardmap ] ) is called the standard map , whose dynamics is characterized by one parameter @xmath12 . when @xmath13 , the variables @xmath14 are trapped on the kam torus . when @xmath15 exceeds the critical value @xmath16 , they diffuse into the chaotic sea on the phase space .",
    "we couple two kicked rotors whose kick strengths are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the coupled rotors is given by @xmath19 this type of model has been used by adachi et al @xcite , kubotani et al @xcite , and sakagami et al@xcite . in this paper",
    "we choose the interaction hamiltonian @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a coupling constant . the interaction hamiltonian @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) causes continuous interaction between the two degrees of freedom through the action variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "hereafter we call the coupled kick rotors as a pp - coupling model .      according to the de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum theory @xcite",
    ", we construct a bundle of deterministic rigid trajectories from a wave function in the pp - coupling model .",
    "first , we express the wave function with respect to the polar coordinate : @xmath46,\\ ] ] where the @xmath47 representation is chosen , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real - valued functions . using this expression , we decompose the schrdinger equation into two parts : @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a original potential : @xmath53 and @xmath54 is what we call a quantum potential : @xmath55    next , we consider an ensemble consisting of quantum particles with the initial distribution function @xmath56 . for the particles , we can define rigid trajectories as follows .",
    "the momentum @xmath57 of a particle on a trajectory is equalized to the spatial gradient of the phase part of the wave function , @xmath49 : @xmath58 from the hamilton s canonical equation , the particle moves according to the velocity : @xmath59 integration of eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) with respect to @xmath60 yields a time - parameterized trajectory .",
    "the relation ( [ velocity ] ) allows eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) to be rewritten as @xmath61 which reserves conservation of the distribution function @xmath62 .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonjacobi ] ) corresponds to the hamilton - jacobi equation in classical mechanics .",
    "compared with the classical one , the additional term @xmath63 appears in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonjacobi ] ) .",
    "the term shows quantum effect on quantum trajectories .",
    "that is why @xmath63 is called a quantum potential .",
    "we mention that eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) appears to show wkb approximation . by definition , however , @xmath49 is not equivalent to the phase part of the wkb wave function , @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath64 is determined by the classical hamilton - jacobi equation which does not include the quantum potential @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , only if @xmath63 is negligible , @xmath49 happens to be equal to @xmath64 .",
    "in other words , the quantum trajectory picture is not limited to wkb regions and always defined consistently irrespective of any approximation schemes .",
    "in this section , we numerically trace quantum trajectories in the coupled kick rotor model constructed in the section 2 and compare them with classical ones . for this aim , we first solve the original schrdinger equation instead of the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hamiltonjacobi ] ) . to represent a wave function numerically , we use @xmath65 mesh points .",

    "1 shows that introduction of coupling with other degrees of freedom may change the quantum dynamics drastically .",

    "1 , it suggests similarity between the classical and quantum dynamics@xcite .",
    "the classical dynamics of a single kicked rotor is reduced to a map between the variables at discretized time as mentioned in the section 2 . for the coupled kicked rotors ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the map is @xmath89 where @xmath90 are the canonical variables at the discretized time @xmath80 ( n=0 , 1 , 2 , @xmath91 ) .",

    "the initial straight row of particles is going to be broken at the region where the particle density is increased by condensation of the quantum trajectories .",
    "next , we estimate effective acceleration of a quantum particle induced by a kick . in the classical system , nonlinearity in the kick",
    "is enhanced by the free motion after the kick . for a kicked rotor ,",

    "the numerical estimation of @xmath112 and @xmath113 does not converge with respect to the integration step size , since they may go through the irregularly large quantum potential . in fig .",

    "we can find the tendency that the particles in the region @xmath117 are accelerated and ones in the region @xmath118 are decelerated , although not a few particles do nt follow the tendency and the acceleration and deceleration amplitude is weaker than in the genuine classical case @xmath119 .",
    "the tendency is obscure in fig.5(a ) for a single rotor model .",

    "we distribute initial probe particles uniformly between @xmath120 and @xmath88 on the surfaces @xmath121 ( i=0 , 1 , @xmath91 , 9 ) as shown in fig .",

    "the density of quantum particles is conserved in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) .",
    "the volume elements of the density in the configuration space obtain entanglement after several kicks .",
    "in addition to the dynamics , we also check the distribution of the momentum of the quantum particle , latexmath:[\\[f_q(p_1)=\\int \\int dq_1 dq_2    definition , it may differ from the amplitude of the wave function in the @xmath23-representation ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the result is given in fig.7 .",
    "in order to recognize the role of nonlinearity in quantum systems , we estimated quantum trajectories for the coupled kick rotor model .",
    "it has recently been known phenomenologically that effect of the nonlinearity appears differently , depending on the degrees of freedom of a system @xcite-@xcite . in a single kicked rotor , for example , suppression of the momentum diffusion appears and the wave function is localized . for the coupled kick rotors , on the other hand",
    ", the diffusion in the momentum space seems to continue . in this paper , we compared the single rotor with the coupled rotor model from the viewpoint of quantum trajectories . for a single kick rotor ,",
    "the acceleration of a quantum particle induced by the impulsive kicks is suppressed by the quantum potential(fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . for the coupled two rotors , by contrast ,",
    "entanglement in the two dimensional configuration space is realized ( fig . 6 ) and",
    "suppression of the acceleration by the kick is mild in spite of repulsion between trajectories(fig .",
    "3(c ) ) . in fact , some particles are really accelerated ( fig . 5 )",
    "the dispersion of the momentum of the particles is expanded by the kicks and localization is broken for the wave function ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    a bundle of quantum trajectories flow according to the continuity equation and each trajectory does never go across the others due to the uniqueness theory for solutions of differential equations @xcite .",
    "in one dimensional system , this property appears as the phenomenon that the quantum trajectories are repulsive and the complicated density distribution tends to be flattened .",
    "therefore , the relative acceleration between quantum particles induced by nonlinearity is suppressed in the system .",
    "this results in the localization of the wave function . for the system with redundant degrees of freedom like our coupled kick rotor model , the complicated density distribution",
    "is flattened also into the second degree of freedom .",
    "that is , quantum particles can be scattered forwardly with each other . as a result , the repulsive nature due to quantum interference is not straightforward .",
    "it is the reason why introduction of the coupling yields the possibility that some particles can be accelerated and the localization of the wave function is broken .    in the de broglie - bohm interpretation ,",
    "the momentum of a quantum particle with a rigid trajectory is equalized to the spatial gradient of the phase factor in the wave function . in the pp - coupling model ,",
    "@xmath125 equation ( [ dotdotq ] ) shows that , even if the degrees of freedom , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are uncorrelated initially , that is , @xmath126 , the coupling induces the gradient of quantum potential with respect to the @xmath28-direction and accelerate particles in the direction of the second degree of freedom , @xmath29 .",
    "this effect decreases the gradient of the density of quantum particles and reduces the repulsion in the @xmath28-direction . in the work by adachi et al @xcite , the instantaneous coupling between the configuration variables @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "is introduced as a model to analyze . in this case , mixing of the phase factor in the wave function is induced directly by the coupling and causes the acceleration along the @xmath29-axis .",
    "redundant degrees of freedom help the classical diffusion , which is analogous to the ergodicity although the phase space is not compact in our model .",
    "our analysis also shows that multi - dimensional systems emulate partly the classical dynamics . on one hand ,",
    "the quantum trajectory is altered by repulsion in short range . in global range ,",
    "on the other hand , it may express nonlinearity in the system .",
    "we may say that the ehrenfest time scale is not active in our analysis where the wave function is spread widely from the beginning and continues diffusion in the uncompact phase space .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that we can treat the appearance of the classical property as a matter of the scale of the discrepancy between trajectories rather than a matter of the time scale , such as the ehrenfest time scale . to clarify the dependence of the dynamics on the spatial discrepancy between quantum trajectories",
    ", we have to make further qualitative analysis .",
    "the analysis need more computational memory and more cpu time and will be presented elsewhere .    as demonstrated in this paper , the de broglie - bohm picture which gives rigid trajectories is helpful to understand the dynamics equivalent to the unitary evolution driven by the schrdinger equation . in the quantum trajectory picture",
    ", however , the superposition of the right going and left going waves which have the same and opposite momentum is identified with the static state with zero momentum . in our analysis , therefore , we utilized the averaged velocity @xmath103 rather than the velocity at a moment , ( [ velocity ] ) . in fig .",
    "2 , the characteristic plateaus appears at the classically forbidden point @xmath127 which corresponds to the elliptical fixed point , while does not in fig .",
    "7 . for comparison with the statistical distribution on the phase space , the wigner and husimi descriptions have certainly preferable points@xcite . to understand the quantum dynamics in multi - dimensional non - linear systems further , the de broglie - bohm approach and complementally the wigner and husimi functions will be needed .",
