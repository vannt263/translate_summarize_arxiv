    "the detection of spectral signatures associated with the environment of a @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) would provide important clues about the triggering mechanism and the progenitor ( mszros & rees 1998 ; lazzati , campana & ghisellini 1999 ; bttcher 2000 ) .",
    "observations with _",
    "chandra _ , _ asca _ and _",
    "beppo_sax have provided tentative evidence for fe k@xmath1 line and edge features in at least five bursts ; grb  970508 ( piro et al . 1999 ) , grb  970828 ( yoshida et al . 1999 ) , grb  991216 ( piro et al .",
    "2000 ) and grb  000214 ( antonelli et al .",
    "2000 ) all show an emission feature during the x - ray afterglow a few hours to a day after the burst event ; while grb  990705 ( amati et al .",
    "2000 ) displays a prominent x - ray absorption feature during the burst itself .",
    "although most of the line detections are only marginally significant and fail to distinguish between the various line excitation mechanisms , grb  991216 shows a 3.49@xmath20.06  kev line at a moderate confidence level ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is consistent with emission from h - like fe ( fe  xxvi ) at the redshift of the most distant absorption system along the line of sight at @xmath4=1.02 ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "2000 ) . a similar observation , but with higher signal - to - noise , may be able to distinguish between the various line emission mechanisms and lead to the correct determination of the line energy .",
    "the large equivalent widths ( @xmath5 a few kev ) inferred from the x - ray features favor models in which the line is produced by reflection ( vietri et al . 2000 ; rees & mszros 2000 ) , rather than transmission .",
    "any detection of emission features in the afterglow spectra some hours after the burst ( such as in grb  991216 ) therefore imposes strong constraints on the location and geometry of the optically thick reflecting material .",
    "observing an x - ray line at a time @xmath6 after the burst implies that the emitting material must be located within a distance @xmath7 from the explosion site , thus strongly limiting the size of the remnant .",
    "however , this gas can not be optically thick along the line of sight because this would smear out the short - time variability of the burst radiation .",
    "these conditions point towards a strongly anisotropic environment from which a grb is seen only if we happen to observe the system through a line of sight with low optical depth ( bttcher 2000 ; vietri et al .",
    "2000 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "two types of reflection models have been developed to explain the origin of the x - ray emission features .",
    "the first invokes the interaction of the primary x - ray emission from the afterglow with an fe - enriched , thomson - thick , asymmetric remnant , which compton scatters x - rays into our line of sight ( vietri et al .",
    "2000 ; bttcher & fryer 2000 ) .",
    "this scenario requires a mass @xmath8 of fe at a distance about 1.5 light days , possibly due to a remnant of an explosive event or a supernova that occurred days or weeks prior to the grb ( see vietri & stella 1998 ; in contrast with macfadyen & woosley 1999 which favors a simultaneous supernova explosion ) .",
    "the other type of model involves a long - lived ( @xmath9 ) magnetar or accreting black hole with a continuing but decaying outflow that interacts with the stellar envelope at distances less than a light - hour ( rees & mszros 2000 ; mszros & rees 2001 ) . in this case",
    "only a small mass of fe is required , and can be readily produced by the star itself .    under both interpretations",
    ", it is likely that reflection takes place in highly ionized surfaces .",
    "this can lead to strong comptonization of the emergent fe line , and other absorption and emission features . in this paper , we present and discuss detailed , self - consistent computations of the temperature and ionization structure of a uniform slab of gas ionized by the incident radiation of a grb and of the resulting reflection spectra .",
    "our analysis applies to an optically thick , homogeneous medium , significantly extending previous analysis in the optically thin regime ( e.g. weth et al .",
    "2000 ; bttcher 2000 ) , which is hard - pressed to explain the observed fe - line feature in grb 991216 ( vietri et al .",
    "we estimate the strength of the fe  k@xmath1 line that each model produces .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of these results for current and future x - ray observations .",
    "we employ the reflection code developed by ross , weaver & mccray ( 1978 ) and updated by ross & fabian ( 1993 ) .",
    "we consider the illumination of the first 12 thomson depths of a infinite , uniform slab of gas by radiation with a power - law spectrum of photon index @xmath10 incident at an angle @xmath11 to the normal ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "the incident radiation is treated analytically in a ` one - stream ' approximation , while the diffuse radiation that results from both the compton scattering of the incident radiation and emission from the gas itself , is treated using the fokker ",
    "planck / diffusion method of ross et al .",
    "once thermal and ionization equilibrium in the slab is found , the reflection spectrum is computed .",
    "we assume that hydrogen and helium are completely ionized , but include the partially ionized species c  v  vii , o  v  ix , mg  ix  xiii , si  xi ",
    "xv , and fe  xvi  xxvii .    for a given @xmath10 , the temperature and ionization state of the surface of the slab is expected to depend mainly on the value of the ionization parameter , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total illuminating flux ( from 0.01 - 100  kev ) and @xmath14 is the hydrogen number density ( ross et al .",
    "if the grb explodes within a young supernova ( sn ) remnant , the x - rays from the afterglow will illuminate fe - rich ( @xmath5 ten times solar fe abundance ) material , leading to recombination line emission by reflection ( vietri et al .",
    "reasonable values of @xmath15 expected in this scenario are @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the source luminosity in units of erg s@xmath18 , @xmath14 is the hydrogen density in units of @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the distance from the burst explosion to the material in units of cm .",
    "we adopt the convention @xmath21 for expressing the physical parameters .",
    "the time delay of a few days observed in grb  991216 yields an incident angle for the radiation of @xmath22 ( vietri et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , line emission can be produced when a post - burst outflow , possibly magnetically dominated , impacts on the walls of a funnel excavated in the stellar envelope ( se ) at distances less than a light - hour ( rees & mszros 2000 ) .",
    "luminosities as high as @xmath23 erg s@xmath18 are expected 1 day after the burst , if they are due either to the spinning down millisecond pulsar or to a highly magnetized torus around a black - hole ( rees & mszros 2000 ) .",
    "the ionization parameter in the stellar envelope case is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ratio of ionizing to mhd luminosity ( rees & mszros 2000 ) .",
    "the incident flux would be deflected along the funnel walls with different incident angles before escaping the funnel : for simplicity we assume @xmath22 .",
    "for these uniform - density slabs we vary @xmath15 by changing the total illuminating flux while keeping the hydrogen number density @xmath14 , the distance from the burst @xmath20 and the incident angle @xmath11 fixed .",
    "1 shows the results for illumination by a @xmath10=2 spectrum for both of the scenarios described above .",
    "the illuminating and reflected spectra are displayed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the spectral energy flux and @xmath28 is the photon energy .",
    "the models with the highest ionization parameter ( @xmath29 ) are excellent reflectors , and show almost no fe spectral features .",
    "this is because the surface layer is almost fully ionized , and fe  xxvi does not become dominant until @xmath30 .",
    "the temperature at the surface of the slab is @xmath5 1.9 @xmath31  k , the compton temperature for the incident spectrum",
    ". the spectrum drops at @xmath5 50  kev because we included a sharp energy cut - off in the incident spectrum at 100 kev considered here , extending the illuminating spectrum to higher energies ( @xmath32  kev ) would have little effect on the iron ionization and spectral features ( e.g. , ross et al .",
    "1999 ) . ] .",
    "compton reflection produces a slight steeping in the reflected spectrum , which mimics a power law with @xmath33 in the 3 - 30 kev band . for example",
    ", we find @xmath10=2.3 in the @xmath34 sn case and @xmath10=2.14 in the @xmath34 se case .    when the illuminating flux is reduced so that @xmath35 , fe k@xmath1 emission and fe k - shell absorption features begin to appear .",
    "most of the k@xmath1 photons originate at @xmath36 and emerge as broad comptonized lines with weak cores .",
    "the h - like k@xmath1 photons at 6.97  kev are generated close to the surface , but are resonantly trapped and removed from the narrow line core by compton scattering .",
    "the he - like inter - combination line at 6.7  kev is not subject to resonant trapping , but is generated at such high @xmath37 ( see panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "2 ) that it is multiply compton scattered on leaving the slab . the broad comptonized emission features blended into the compton smeared k - shell absorption edge , are an important signature of ionized reflection .",
    "the effect of increasing the iron abundance at a fixed ionization parameter is illustrated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "1 . the comptonized line and the absorption feature are increasingly significant for an fe - rich medium .    with @xmath38 ,",
    "fe  xxv becomes dominant at @xmath39 ( see panel ( a ) in fig .",
    "narrow emission line resulting from fe  xxv can now be seen superimposed on the compton - broadened emission bump .",
    "the tiny emission feature just above 8.8 kev results from radiative recombination directly to the ground level of fe  xxv ( see the @xmath40 se case in fig 2 ) . in the model with @xmath41 the fe emission",
    "is suppressed because fe  xvii - xxii dominates close to the surface , but their k@xmath1 photons are destroyed by the auger effect during resonance trapping ( ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath42 the reflection spectrum is similar to that of a cold , neutral slab , and so the narrow emission line at 6.4 kev is dominant .    the effect of increasing the incident angle @xmath11 , which is a key ingredient in the pre - ejection models because it is responsible for the observed time - delay , is also illustrated in fig . 1 by the dot - dashed line .",
    "radiation that illuminates the atmosphere more directly ionizes more deeply into the slab than radiation at grazing incidence . at high flux levels the emergent line features",
    "are little changed , however , the k - shell absorption features become more prominent for radiation that impacts closer to the normal of the slab .    the ionization structure in the outer layers of the illuminated slab",
    "also depends on the incident radiation spectrum .",
    "3 shows the fe k@xmath1 equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of incident luminosity for a series of reflection spectra with @xmath431.6 , 2.0 & 2.4 , assuming @xmath44 .",
    "the ews were calculated with respect to the reflection spectrum , and the integration was carried out between 5.7 and 7.1  kev . as seen in fig .",
    "1 , the ew of the fe k@xmath1 line decreases with @xmath17 in both grb scenarios .",
    "this behavior continues until @xmath17 is sufficiently low for the narrow fe k@xmath1 emission line to be suppressed by the auger effect .",
    "the ews are generally larger when the illuminating spectrum is steeper ( i.e. , @xmath10 is greater ) .",
    "the weaker ionizing power of steep spectra allow line emission to persist at the highest luminosities , although the ews still end up quite low when @xmath45 . in a grb",
    ", softer spectra may be important if both the line emission arises from the impact of the continuous energy output with the compact remnant and much of the observed continuum emission ( with a flatter @xmath10 ) comes from the afterglow emission directly .",
    "the emission feature observed @xmath5 1.5 days after the grb  991216 burst ( piro et al . 2000 ) had a line luminosity of @xmath46 erg s@xmath18 and an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath5 0.5 kev .",
    "the continuum flux from grb  991216 , measured to have @xmath47 , in the 110 kev band was 50100 times stronger than the flux in the line .",
    "as is clear from the above discussion , the emission feature can be explained by reflection if identified with the recombination k@xmath1 line from he - like iron at 6.7 kev .",
    "taking @xmath48 in the se scenario , a continuous ionizing luminosity of @xmath49 erg s@xmath18 ( or a continuous wind luminosity of @xmath50 erg s@xmath18 with @xmath51 ; see rees & mszros 2000 ) would be sufficient to produce the observed line inferred by piro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . ] .",
    "however , it is possible that the reflected and incident spectra are observed together . with the above parameters , the line luminosity and ew calculated for the total spectrum ( reflected + incident ) are @xmath52 erg s@xmath18 and ew @xmath5 0.250.7 kev . if the illuminating spectrum is a steeper power - law ( @xmath53 2 ) , then a smaller fraction of illuminating photons lie in the 920 kev range which dominates the ionization of fe , and thus an increase in either @xmath17 , @xmath54 or the fe abundance is required in order to reproduce the same line strength ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    alternatively ,",
    "an x - ray afterglow with @xmath48 illuminating the walls of a supernova remnant with a luminosity of @xmath55 would produce a line signal with @xmath56 erg s@xmath18 and ew @xmath5 0.20.8 kev .",
    "however , an essential assumption contained in this model is that the material responsible for emission - line features is illuminated by the early afterglow radiation ( or the grb itself ) with @xmath57 .",
    "such high luminosities would cause the spectral features resulting from iron to disappear or , at best , to be extremely weak ( even for larger values of @xmath10 , see fig .",
    "moreover , this early incident radiation can be harder than a @xmath58 spectrum with a significant fraction of the energy above the @xmath59 formation energy threshold , and a high compactness parameter .",
    "this will cause new pairs to be formed in the originally optically thick scattering medium , an effect which amplifies the density of scattering charges and increases the temperature of the illuminating material .",
    "when pairs are produced in sufficient numbers , the iron k@xmath1 emission is suppressed due to the decrease in the number of recombinations .",
    "these effects will be investigated elsewhere ( lazzati , ramirez - ruiz & rees 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "these problems may be overcome in particular source geometries for which lower luminosities and softer spectra are expected at the edges of the relativistic outflow .",
    "the results presented in fig .  1 show that if the observed fe k@xmath1 line from grb  991216 is identified solely with the h - like line at 6.97 kev , as suggested by piro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , then this is inconsistent with emission from a photoionized optically thick slab .",
    "their detailed analysis of the _ chandra _ acis - s spectrum shows marginal evidence ( at the @xmath60 level ) of an emission feature at 4.4 @xmath2 0.5 kev .",
    "identifying this feature with the fe recombination edge with rest energy of 9.28 kev gives @xmath4= 1.1 @xmath2 0.1 , consistent with the redshift of a h - like fe k@xmath1 line .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to emphasize that the observations presented by piro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) do not rule out the presence of a he - like fe feature ( or a blend between h and he - like features as shown in fig .",
    "some ambiguity also remains in the rest energy of the emission since doppler blue - shifts of order @xmath61 are expected in both reflection scenarios ( vietri et al .",
    "2000 ; rees & mszros 200 ; mszros & rees 2001 ) and may confuse precise measurements of the line energy . indeed , for an expansion velocity of @xmath61 , the emission feature at 4.4 @xmath2 0.5 kev could be attributed to the fe  xxv radiative recombination emission just above 8.8 kev rather than to the fe recombination edge at 9.28 kev .",
    "finally , co produces both a he and h - like emission line : at 7.242 kev and just above 7.526 kev , respectively .",
    "the exact strength of these features , which we do not include in our calculations , could be important in both of the scenarios discussed here and may confuse the identification of low signal - to - noise spectral features .",
    "we have presented calculations of x - ray reflection from thomson - thick slabs for conditions which may arise in the immediate environment of a grb .",
    "comparisons between putative fe k@xmath1 lines detected in x - ray afterglows and those predicted by the computations will be useful in distinguishing between the various line emission mechanisms . we expect that more sensitive data on x - ray afterglow spectral features will impose strong constraints on the nature of grb progenitors and their environments .",
