    "the behaviour of materials under spatial confinement is modified compared to that in the bulk . on reducing a system to a lengthscale comparable to the size of its constituent particles",
    "one observes new structures @xcite , modified dynamics @xcite and phase behaviour differing from that of the bulk system @xcite .",
    "while many effects of confinement are due to finite system size and volume exclusion effects near a wall , others can be attributed to the properties of the boundary .",
    "for instance , local density is enhanced in the vicinity of an attractive wall and decreased near a repulsive wall @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the freezing temperature of materials is raised with respect to the bulk when confined by attractive walls while repulsive walls have the opposite effect , lowering the freezing temperature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , confinement by smooth boundaries affects behaviour differently than similar rough walls . for sufficient system density ,",
    "smooth walls induce particle layering resulting in oscillatory density profiles perpendicular to the boundary , often promoting crystallisation @xcite .",
    "if instead the wall is rough on the particle lengthscale , this layering is inhibited and crystallisation is suppressed @xcite .",
    "dynamically , rough walls are found to suppress particle mobility compared to smooth walls resulting in an increase in relaxation time @xcite . the density ( in colloidal samples ) or temperature ( in molecular liquids ) at which the glass transition occurs is similarly dependent on the confining lengthscale and the boundary details @xcite . through understanding and controlling the boundaries confining a system one can alter the energy landscape it experiences , offering new routes to self - assembly and control of reaction rates and crystal growth @xcite .",
    "the research described here is concerned with a two - dimensional hard disc system . at sufficient density ,",
    "bulk hard discs adopt a locally hexagonal structure @xcite . when confined to a narrow channel by smooth , hard walls , however , new structural ordering emerges .",
    "for confining walls separated by a distance corresponding to an integer number of close packed particle layers , the confinement is commensurate with the crystalline lattice and hexagonal ordering is unimpeded @xcite . in the incommensurate case , when an integer number of hexagonal layers do not fit the channel , buckled structures arise @xcite . at lower particle densities , a modulated fluid structure exists , consisting of particle layers parallel to the walls @xcite .",
    "although locally hexagonal ordering is possible in hard disc systems confined by smooth , flat walls , such ordering is incommensurate with a curved boundary , resulting in the suppression of hexagonal ordering in a variety of systems confined by a hard circular wall . instead , circularly confined samples adopt a concentrically layered structure that mimics the symmetry of the confining geometry @xcite as predicted by density functional theory @xcite .",
    "if , instead of a strictly hard wall , the circular boundary is soft or adaptive then qualitatively different behaviour is observed .",
    "we have previously shown that a deformable circular boundary capable of responding to the shape of a confined sample allows locally hexagonal ordering for sufficiently dense systems @xcite .",
    "the result is an entropically - driven bistability between concentrically layered configurations reminiscent of hard wall confinement and these structures with enhanced locally hexagonal order reminiscent of bulk hard discs at comparable densities .",
    "such locally hexagonal ordering is not observed in equivalent systems confined by hard walls , suggesting that this behaviour is facilitated by the decreased ` strictness ' of a deformable boundary compared to a hard wall .",
    "here we explore the role of the strictness of a curved boundary in inhibiting locally hexagonal ordering in circularly confined hard disc systems through a combined experimental and simulated approach to two model systems .",
    "we describe the relationship between boundary deformation and hexagonal ordering in the experimental model system known as the ` colloidal corral ' @xcite and show , via monte carlo simulation , that controlling the deformability of the confining boundary allows the tuning of the aforementioned structural bistability .",

    "<S> * the behaviour of materials under spatial confinement is sensitively dependent on the nature of the confining boundaries . in two dimensions , confinement within a hard circular boundary inhibits the hexagonal ordering observed in bulk systems at high density . using colloidal experiments and monte carlo simulations , we investigate two model systems of quasi hard discs under circularly symmetric confinement . </S>",
    "<S> the first system employs an adaptive circular boundary , defined experimentally using holographic optical tweezers . </S>",
    "<S> we show that deformation of this boundary allows , and indeed is required for , hexagonal ordering in the confined system . </S>",
    "<S> the second system employs a circularly symmetric optical potential to confine particles without a physical boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the absence of a curved wall , near perfect hexagonal ordering is possible . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the degree to which hexagonal ordering is suppressed by a curved boundary is determined by the ` strictness ' of that wall . * </S>"
