    "between 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 years after the big bang , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) changed from being cold and neutral to being warm and ionized . an early generation of massive stars with very low metal content producing copious uv radiation is the most likely cause of reionization @xcite .",
    "x - rays from accretion onto compact objects , either stellar mass or supermassive , are thought to have heated the igm and may have made a @xmath4 per cent contribution to reionization @xcite .",
    "x - rays from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) dominate the x - ray background at @xmath5 , but recent work places strong constraints on x - ray emission from agn at high @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent work on the formation of the first stars suggest that they had typical masses of a few tens of @xmath7 and formed in small multiple systems often dominated by a binary @xcite .",
    "the formation of supermassive objects , @xmath8 , was rare @xcite .",
    "thus , accretion onto stellar - mass compact objects likely dominated the x - ray emission in the early universe with a significant fraction occurring in binary systems @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to detect hmxbs in the early universe using current instruments to obtain direct observational constraints .",
    "a number of authors have considered the effects of hmxbs on the early universe with inferences about their properties drawn from theory or observations of milky way black hole binaries and have assumed hard power - law spectra with photon indices of 1.32.0 @xcite sometimes with a soft thermal component @xcite providing a minority of the total energy output . here , we attempt to infer the properties of early hmxbs based on local analogues in nearby galaxies . the early universe was highly metal deficient @xcite .",
    "metallicity appears to have a strong impact on the formation and properties of x - ray binaries .",
    "we discuss the properties of x - ray binaries found in low metallicity environments in the local universe in section  [ sec : binaries ] and some of the implications for the study of binaries in the early universe in section  [ sec : implications ] .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is a brief summary .",
    "the bulk of x - ray emission from galaxies not hosting an active nucleus arises from compact objects formed at the endpoint of the stellar evolution of massive stars ( typically @xmath9 ) in binary systems .",
    "the x - ray binaries that form within 100  myr after birth of their parent stars are dominated by high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) in which the companion star has a high mass and therefore evolves rapidly .",
    "hmxbs also dominated the x - ray binary population of the early universe due to their rapid evolution .",
    "the number of hmxbs and the total x - ray luminosity they produce is well correlated with the host galaxy star formation rate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the occurrence of very bright hmxbs or ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , defined here as having luminosities above @xmath10 , is correlated with recent starburst activity @xcite .    the number of ulxs in @xcite and the total x - ray luminosity of @xcite a galaxy , normalised by its star formation rate ( sfr ) , increases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "these trends are enhanced at very low metalliticies , @xmath11 , where the number of ulxs increases by a factor of @xmath12 ( normalized to sfr ) relative to near - solar - metallicity galaxies @xcite and the total x - ray luminosity increases by a factor of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "population synthesis simulations of the formation and evolution of high mass x - ray binaries in low metallicity environments also suggest enhanced x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite found that the number of hmxbs ( per unit sfr ) increased about a factor of 3 between solar and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) metallicity @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite found that the number of hmxbs at @xmath15 increased by a factor of @xmath16 relative to solar metallicity and the number of ulxs increased by a factor of @xmath17 due to an increase in the number of binary systems evolving through the pathways that form roche - lobe overflow systems and supergiant wind accretors . also",
    ", the maximum black hole mass increases with decreasing metallicity @xcite , reaching as high as @xmath18 for @xmath19 compared with @xmath20 for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to form more luminous x - ray binaries at low metallicity without violating the eddington limit .",
    ".,width=307 ]      it is clear that the number of hmxbs and their total x - ray luminosity is enhanced at low metallicity .",
    "a key question for understanding the contribution of x - ray binaries to heating and reionization is the shape of their emission spectrum . the hmxb x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) is well described by a power - law distribution with an exponent near -1.6 and a cut - off near @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the xlf in low metallicity galaxies has the same form and exponent @xcite .",
    "figure  [ xlf ] shows the integrated luminosity from sources with luminosities above a given threshold .",
    "the shallow slope of the hmxb xlf implies that the total luminosity is dominated by bright sources .",
    "half of the flux from active sources ( with @xmath23 ) is produced by sources with @xmath24 , 71 percent by sources with @xmath25 , and 90 per cent by sources with @xmath26 .",
    "the total luminosity and , hence , the spectral shape of the emission from a population of hmxbs is dominated by ulxs and hmxbs in high luminosity states .",
    "black hole x - ray binaries in the milky way exhibit hard spectra , following a power - law form with photon index near 1.7 , at low luminosities , and then transition to states with softer spectra at higher luminosities .",
    "these softer spectra are a combination of a thermal component with temperatures up to a few kev and steep power - laws with photon indices near 2.5 .",
    "these sources reach luminosities up to @xmath27@xcite .",
    "ulxs produce a large fraction of the total x - ray luminosity and exhibit spectra that show distinct curvature in the 28  kev band .",
    "this was first demonstrated with high statistical quality xmm - newton spectra @xcite .",
    "the curvature in ulx spectra has recently been confirmed with suzaku and joint nustar / xmm - newton observations .",
    "suzaku observations of the starburst galaxy m82 show that its x - ray spectrum , seen in chandra imaging to be dominated by a ulx @xcite , has a cut - off energy of @xmath28  kev when fitted with an exponentially cut - off model @xcite .",
    "xmm - newton / nustar spectra of the ulx ngc 1313 x-2 show cut - off energies near 2.5  kev while those of ngc 1313 x-1 show cut - off energies in the range 59  kev @xcite .",
    "the hmxb in the very low metallicity galaxy i zw 18 ( @xmath29 ) , shows a transition from a hard power - law spectum at low luminosity to a curved spectrum at high luminosity @xcite . when fitted with an exponentially cut - off model",
    ", the high luminosity spectrum has a cut - off energy of @xmath30  kev and a photon index of @xmath31 .",
    "some recent papers , e.g.  @xcite , have assumed a hard power - law with photon index of 1.7 for the hmxb spectrum based on measurements of hmxbs in nearby galaxies made by @xcite using chandra .",
    "these results are influenced by the low numbers of counts in the chandra spectra .",
    "@xcite find that a power law is unacceptable for 39 per cent of the spectra with more than 1000 counts but only 8 per cent of the spectra with fewer than 200 counts .",
    "the average photon index was derived using only those spectra for which a power law provided a statistically acceptable fit , systematically excluding those spectra exhibiting evidence for curvature and indirectly excluding a higher fraction of spectra with larger numbers of counts .",
    "other work has considered the transition to softer spectra at the luminosities seen from milky way x - ray binaries , but not the curved spectra seen from ulxs @xcite .",

    "studies of galaxies with low metallicity suggest that the total luminosity of early x - ray binaries ( normalised to sfr ) is likely enhanced relative to near - solar metallicity systems and that the total spectrum is likely dominated by systems in high luminosity states with curved spectra .",
    "this spectral curvature may potentially affect : constraints on early x - rays from measurements of the soft x - ray background , constraints on the ratio of x - ray luminosity to sfr at high redshift obtained from deep x - ray surveys , the detectability of the first hmxbs , the morphology of x - ray heating , and the 21  cm radio signal from the epoch of reionization .",
    "figure  [ zspec ] shows power law and exponentially cut - off power law spectra at redshifts of @xmath38 and @xmath37 in the top panel and the observed flux in the 0.52  kev band as a function of redshift for these models in the bottom panel  essentially the ` k - correction ' for each spectral model .",
    "this band is often used in deep x - ray surveys . for a fixed observational energy band , an exponential cut - off in the spectrum",
    "has a strong effect on the observed flux as the red - shifted cut - off energy moves into the band .",
    "because of the rather hard photon index measured for i zw 18 , this effect is somewhat negated at low redshifts because that spectrum rises with energy at energies below the cut - off .",
    "spectral curvature affects observational constraints on x - rays from early binaries . with the assumption of a hard , power law spectrum for the hmxb emission , a significant hmxb contribution to reionization",
    "is excluded @xcite . however , even with a break energy as high as 5  kev , the cut - off energy of emission from @xmath39 would be redshifted to 0.5  kev , below the 0.52 kev band typically used in deep x - ray surveys .",
    "if the total hmxb emission spectrum has significant curvature as seen in the ulx spectra , then constraints from the soft x - ray background on the emission from early x - ray binaries become very weak .",
    "x - ray emission sufficient to fully power reionization is allowed @xcite .",
    "deep x - ray surveys can also be used to constrain the emission from hmxbs and the ratio of x - ray luminosity to sfr ( @xmath40/sfr ) at high redshift . as noted above",
    ", @xcite performed a stacking analysis of star - forming galaxies in the chandra deep field south .",
    "in addition to calculating the total x - ray emission in various redshift bands , they also estimated the total sfr of the target galaxies in each band . correcting for the effect of redshift on the observed flux in the 0.52  kev band using a power - law model with a photon index of 2",

    "the latter constraints are consistent with the increase in @xmath40/sfr expected due to the decrease in metallicity at high redshifts while the former would suggest that the results from low - metallicity nearby galaxies , mainly blue compact dwarfs in the samples of @xcite and @xcite , may overpredict the x - ray emission from the larger galaxies detected at high redshifts .    , 6 , and 12",

    "it is apparent that interstellar absorption has a severe effect , strongly reducing the x - ray flux and the band over which x - rays are detected .",
    "we note that current ccd detectors operate efficiently only above energies of about 0.2  kev .",
