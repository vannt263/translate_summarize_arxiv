    "in this paper we develop an effective method to find all finite abelian regular coverings ( up to isomorphism ) of a graph , admitting lifts of a given group of automorphisms of the graph .",

    "recently , people have been paying much attention to symmetries of graphs . an initial motivation to find regular coverings admitting lifts of a given group of automorphisms of the base graph",

    "for example , new families of 2-arc - transitive graphs were constructed in @xcite as long as 2-arc - transitive @xmath2-coverings were found .",
    "a systematic method was developed in @xcite to find isomorphism classes of elementary abelian coverings of a graph that admit lifts of given automorphisms ; the method was applied in @xcite to classify vertex - transitive elementary abelian coverings of the petersen graph .",
    "besides the ones mentioned above , there are many such results , see @xcite , and so on .    but",
    "classification of general finite abelian regular coverings of a graph is never seen .",
    "theoretically , as pointed out in @xcite , classification of general finite abelian regular coverings can be reduced to that of elementary abelian ones .",
    "but the difficulty is that , when elementary abelian regular coverings are classified , one still needs to go on to classify elementary abelian regular coverings of each of these covering graphs , and go on again .",
    "one is not able to stop at a step and say that the classification of abelian regular coverings of the initial graph is completed !    our paper makes a breakthrough .",
    "the method is based on the criterion for lifting automorphisms proposed by the first author in @xcite .",
    "we reduce the problem ( problem [ prob : initial ] ) of finding abelian coverings to that ( problem [ prob : final ] ) of finding numbers and matrices satisfying certain conditions .",
    "the content is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a preliminary on topological graph theory .",
    "section 3 is a framework suitable for general graphs and automorphisms ; to determine all abelian regular coverings to which some given automorphisms can be lifted , a practical method is developed and written down as algorithm [ alg ] .",
    "section 4 is devoted to classifying all arc - transitive finite abelian regular coverings of the petersen graph , and the result is given in theorem [ thm : abelian coverings of petersen ] .",
