    "in the field of quantum computation , discoveries like the algorithms of shor and grover @xcite showed a superior efficiency with regard to their classical equivalents .",
    "the shor algorithm factors efficiently any large number and the grover algorithm locates a marked item in a disordered list of @xmath0 elements in a number of steps proportional to @xmath1 , instead of the @xmath2 of its classical counterpart .",
    "this search algorithm has also a continuous time version @xcite that has been described as the analog analogue of the original grover algorithm .",
    "we have recently developed a new quantum search algorithm with continuous time @xcite , that finds a discrete eigenstate of a given hamiltonian @xmath3 , if its eigenenergy is given .",
    "the essence of our algorithm , consists on producing a resonance between the initial state and the looked for state .",
    "this resonant algorithm behaves like grovers s , and its efficiency depends on the spectral density of the hamiltonian @xmath3 . on the other hand , in the last years",
    ", the theory of games has been used to explore the nature of quantum information .",
    "initially quantum games were proposed as the quantum generalization of the classical games but , due to the principles of quantum mechanics , new game possibilities arose .",
    "these studies showed the surprising result that the quantum strategies could be more efficient than classical ones .",
    "the simplest quantum game , described originally by d. meyer meyer , is the pq penny flip .",
    "it has the virtue of allowing an easy connection with quantum algorithms . in this game ,",
    "two players apply unitary operators alternatingly on the same qubit .",
    "the result of the game depends on the final projection of the qubit over its basic states . in this context",
    ", we propose new quantum games built with our quantum search algorithm .",
    "these games are similar to the pq penny flip but we have incorporated to them a continuous time dynamics together with a quantum measurement process .",
    "the strategies of the players will be determined by the moments when the players make measurements on the system .    in the following section we review our quantum search algorithm . in section 3",
    "the measurement process is introduced and the dynamical equation of the system are obtained . in the section 4",
    "we propose different two person zero sum games and we analyze the phase space of strategies .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the algorithm is built on a hamiltonian @xmath3 with normalized eigenstates @xmath4 and eigenvalues @xmath5 . consider a subset * n * of @xmath4 formed by @xmath0 states . let us call @xmath6 the unknown searched state in * n * whose energy @xmath7 is given and @xmath8 the known initial state , whose eigenvalue @xmath9 is also known .",
    "but this initial state does not belong to the search set * n*. so knowing @xmath7 is equivalent to marking  the searched state in grover s algorithm . to build the quantum search algorithm a potential @xmath10 is necessary that produces the coupling between the initial state and the searched state .",
    "our proposal @xcite is the following potential @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an unitary vector which can be interpreted as the average of the set of vectors in * n * , and @xmath13 .",
    "this proposal assures that the interaction potential is hermitian , that the transition probabilities @xmath14 , from state @xmath15 to any state of the set * n * are all equal , and finally that the sum of the transition probabilities verifies @xmath16 . the objective of the algorithm is to find the eigenvector @xmath6 whose transition energy from the initial state @xmath8 is the bohr frequency @xmath17 , with @xmath18 . in order to perform this task the schrdinger equation , with the hamiltonian @xmath19 ,",
    "is solved .",
    "the wave - function , @xmath20 , is expressed as an expansion in the eigenstates @xmath21 of @xmath3 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 for all @xmath24 . after solving the schrdinger equation the following coefficients",
    "are obtained : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27for @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "then the state - probabilities are @xmath31from these equations it is clear that a measurement made at the time @xmath32 has a probability very close to one of yielding the searched state .",
    "this approach is valid as long as all the bohr frequencies satisfy @xmath33 and , in this case , our algorithm behaves qualitatively like grover s .",
    "our search has an oscillatory transition between the initial state and the sought state , the other states are negligibly populated .",
    "the wave function behaves as a time dependent qubit where the coefficients of the eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath6 are alternating in time , that is @xmath34    ) and the initial ( @xmath35 ) states as a function of the time in a circle of unit radius . ]",
    "see fig .",
    "[ game0 ] . then the measurement of any observable of the system produces the collapse of the wave function in the state @xmath8 or @xmath6 .",
    "supposing that the measurement does not modify the hamiltonian @xmath3 and the potential @xmath10 then , after the measurement , the resonance algorithm is not affected and continues to work but starting now from a new initial state , @xmath8 or @xmath6 .",
    "thus , any measurement process will leave the system , with high probability , in one of these two states .",
    "the probabilities associated with the states @xmath6 and @xmath8 initially evolve according to the map of eq.([coeficientes ] ) .",
    "if at time @xmath36 the state is measured , the probabilities that the wave function collapses into either @xmath6 or @xmath8 are given by the eq.([coeficientes ] ) evaluated at @xmath37 .",
    "immediately after this first measurement , the system is in state @xmath6 ( or @xmath8 ) and it has an unitary evolution until the time @xmath38 when a second measurement is made .",
    "the probabilities of the states @xmath6 and @xmath39 after the second measurement at the time @xmath40 , are given by @xmath41(or the same equations exchanging @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore the system undergoes an unitary evolution for arbitrary intervals @xmath44 between consecutive measurements and the probabilities of the states @xmath6 and @xmath8 satisfy the matrix equation @xmath45 \\binom{p_{s}(t_{i})}{p_{j}(t_{i } ) } ,   \\label{matrix}\\]]where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are transition probabilities , always within the approximation @xmath48 .",
    "this last equation looks like a master equation , which suggests that the global evolution of the system could be a markov process .",
    "markovian process have the property that for any set of successive times ( @xmath49 ) the conditional probability at @xmath50 is uniquely determined by the value of stochastic variables at @xmath51 and is not affected by any knowledge of the values at earlier times . in other words ,",
    "the system depends only on the current state and not on the path of the process . in our case ,",
    "the measurement of the states of the system is a simple but extreme form of introducing decoherence that produces a loss of long range memory .",
    "but in eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) , the matrix of conditional probabilities is time - interval dependent , then this equation does not represent a markovian process . anyway , a general solution of the previous equation , for any sequence of measurements , is obtained .",
    "@xmath52 \\binom{p_{s}(0)}{p_{j}(0 ) } ,   \\label{solution}\\]]where @xmath53 and@xmath54 \\right\\ }    \\notag \\\\",
    "\\beta _ { m } & = \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { 1-\\prod\\limits_{i=0}^{m}\\left [ 2p_{i}-1\\right ] \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{coefficients}\\end{aligned}\\]]if we now consider that the measurement processes are performed at regular time intervals , @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ coefficients ] ) becomes @xmath56    \\notag \\\\",
    "\\beta _ { m } & = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ 1-\\left ( \\cos ( 2\\omega \\delta t)\\right ) ^{m}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{coefficients1}\\end{aligned}\\]]in this case all the @xmath57 are equal and the probability distribution satisfies a master equation then the global evolution , in a time involving many measurement events , can be described as a markovian process .",
    "the system has an unitary evolution only between consecutive measurements . at first sight , for a sufficiently large number of measurements , the eq.([coefficients1 ] ) imply that both @xmath58 and @xmath59 tend to @xmath60 independently of the interval between measurements @xmath61 and the initial conditions .",
    "however if the considered total time is fixed the situation is different . when @xmath62 measurements are performed in a total time @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 and the coefficients are @xmath65    \\notag \\\\",
    "\\beta _ { m } & = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ 1-\\left ( \\cos \\frac{\\pi } { m}\\right ) ^{m}\\right ] , \\",
    "\\label{coefficients2}\\end{aligned}\\]]then in this case @xmath66 and @xmath67 when @xmath62 @xmath68 .",
    "this simply means that the more frequently the wave function collapses , the harder it becomes for the algorithm to significantly depart from the initial state .",
    "therefore , in this case the algorithm behaves as an example of the quantum zeno effect , where the a high frequency of measurements hinders the departure of the system from its initial state misra , chiu .",
    "in above theoretical framework , let us consider a simple quantum state flip game played between silvia and juan . initially the system is prepared in the state @xmath8 and the dynamics develops according to the unitary operator @xmath69 associated to the hamiltonian @xmath70 of the search algorithm . at the time @xmath71 , juan measures the state of the system and",
    "afterwards it evolves again with @xmath69 .",
    "silvia knows the time at which juan measured but does not know the result of his measurement .",
    "she measures the system at the time @xmath72 $ ] and then the game concludes .",
    "the result of the last measurement determines who wins the game , if the state is @xmath6 silvia wins @xmath73 ( juan loses @xmath73 ) and if the state is @xmath8 juan wins @xmath73 ( silvia loses @xmath73 ) .     and @xmath74 . the time is expressed in units where @xmath75 ]    this is a two - person , zero - sum game , then the payoff to silvia is the exact opposite of that to juan .",
    "the players must make their measurements obeying the condition @xmath76 but the precise moment when they measure remains their decision and this determines their strategies .",
    "for example , one of the worst strategies for juan is to measure at @xmath77 because independently of the time silvia measures , he loses almost always . to understand this note",
    "that @xmath78 is the optimal time to obtain the searched state ; silvia s measurement is very close to juan s , then the wave function does not evolve ( zeno effect ) and the last state is @xmath6 with high probability .",
    "the probability of the searched state as a function of the times @xmath79 and @xmath74 at which silvia and juan carry out their measurements is presented in fig .",
    "[ game1 ] , where we used the eq.([solution ] ) with @xmath80 ; its values lie above the straight line @xmath81 due to the condition @xmath82 and the different tonalities of gray indicate different probability intervals . looking at this figure , the players can plan their strategies and quickly conclude that it is not an equitable game .",
    "silvia has many winning strategies , juan has no winning strategy , but he has only one strategy that allows him to tie the game .",
    "juan s optimal strategy is to carry out his measurement at @xmath83 @xmath78 , because in this case both players have same probability to win the game , independently from silvia s measurement .",
    "this could be an extreme case of the nash equilibrium @xcite because any change in the strategy of juan could worsen his results and any change of strategy of silvia would be indifferent for her .",
    "the existence of this equilibrium adds to the game another element of interest and in a certain way can surprise us , because we have used quantum rules in the game ( the wave function collapse ) .",
    "but remembering that the global evolution of this game is a markovian process , its existence is a consequence of the mathematical similarity with classical games @xcite .",
    "an interesting variant of the previous game is obtained when a third measurement at @xmath84 is incorporated . in this new game , after silvia s measurement at @xmath85 , the system evolves unitarily until anyone of the players makes a third measurement at time @xmath86 .",
    "again silvia wins @xmath73 and juan loses @xmath73 , if the result of the last measurement is @xmath6 , independently of the result of the previous measurements , otherwise juan wins @xmath73 and silvia loses @xmath73 .",
    "[ game2 ] , shows the probability of the searched state as function of the times @xmath79 and @xmath87 for the new game . in this figure",
    "a new area with high probability appears when the players make their measurements at the beginning of the game .",
    "it is easy to understand this result using the previous ideas of zeno effect and optimal time @xmath78 to make the measurement .",
    "the nash equilibrium is also present for the same strategy as that used in the previous game .     and @xmath74 .",
    "the time is expressed in units where @xmath88    in this game the zone @xmath89 @xmath90 has disappeared as a result of the increase of asymmetry in the players strategies , then silvia s probability to win is bigger than juan s . with the aim to quantify the inequity of these games we now introduce the mean payoff of the game for each player .",
    "in the first place , note that the probabilities of the eq.([solution ] ) , with @xmath80 , have a parametric dependencies on @xmath79 and @xmath74 .",
    "then , using eq.([solution ] ) for the first game , we define the win density for silvia @xmath91 and juan @xmath92 as@xmath93where@xmath94if the players have as strategy to choose @xmath79 and @xmath74 at random , but obeying the constraints , then the probabilities of winning the game are    @xmath95    for silvia and juan respectively .",
    "the expected payoff of silvia is @xmath96 and the expected payoff of juan is @xmath97 , in this game @xmath98 . in the second game , we define the win densities as in first game but substituting @xmath99 and @xmath100 by@xmath101now , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and the expected payoff of silvia is @xmath104 and the expected payoff of juan is @xmath105 .",
    "then , they tie in the first game but silvia wins a little more in average in the second game , although they have the same strategy .    changing the number of measurements allowed in the game and the time intervals between them it is possible to favor anyone of the players . in the second game silvia was the winner but , for example , in games where the players make many measurements at regular time intervals the eq.(coefficients2 ) tell us that juan will be the winner .",
    "then it is possible to modify the proposed games or to introduce others using the equations of the previous section .",
    "a quantum game , as a quantum algorithm , may be seen as a definite sequence of unitary transformations acting over a quantum state , in some hilbert space .",
    "concepts like interference phenomena , quantum measurements , resonances , quantum parallelism , amplification techniques , entanglement , etc should be employed in the new field of quantum games .",
    "we have developed a new kind of quantum game for which there is no classical analogue , it is simple enough and shows the importance of measurement as  a fundamental element in the development of quantum games .",
    "these games may be a tool to study quantum algorithms subjected to external decoherence , as in the extreme case of measurement @xcite .",
    "these games are inspired by the quantum search algorithm but they are very interesting by themselves .",
    "they may be thought , as time dependent games where to win or to lose is determined by the collapse of the qubit in its basic states .",
    "the games strategies are developed by the players choosing the times of measurement .",
    "recent experimental advances allow to obtain and preserve the quantum states for a system of atoms @xcite .",
    "this opens interesting possibilities to trap a quantum system with only two energy levels , that allow the experimental realization of the quantum games proposed in the paper .",
    "finally we should point out that in this work entanglement is absent , the game is developed with only one qubit ; then a challenge for the future is to introduce measurements in quantum games with entanglement @xcite , surely in these cases new interesting behaviors will be obtained .",
