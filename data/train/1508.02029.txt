    "this effect is less pronounced , compare panels b and d. at later times the tracer motion starts to be affected by the confinement exerted by the outer reflecting membrane of the domain at @xmath65 , and the msd begins to saturate to a plateau . concurrently",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath66 tends to zero .",
    "the effect of the crowding fraction @xmath18 on the msd behaviour is illustrated in panels a and b of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] for large and small crowders , respectively . for",
    "a tracer of unit size the larger crowders do not appear to create substantial obstruction for the simulated crowding fractions .",
    "even at relatively large @xmath18 values the msd only marginally diminishes with increasing crowding fraction @xmath18 , see panel a. in other words , small tracers always manage to manoeuvre around large void spaces remaining between large crowders .",
    "in contrast , relatively small crowders at identical crowding fractions @xmath18 yield severe reductions of the average diffusive tracer motion , as evidenced by panel b of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] . this observation is consistent with the dramatic differences of the spatial exploration patterns exhibited by the tracer in panels b of figure [ fig - scheme ] .",
    "the magnitude of the plateau of the msd attained for larger @xmath18 values is much smaller than expected for an annulus without crowders , compare with equation ( [ eq - msd - plateau ] ) below .",
    "this fact is due to the intricate labyrinthine environment formed by the unit sized crowders for diffusion of a tracer of the same size . for small crowders the value of the scaling exponent @xmath67",
    "is reduced significantly and at much earlier times for larger crowding fractions @xmath18 , see panels c and d of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] .",
    "these features obviously strongly depend on the specific quenched environment , in which the tracer motion occurs , resulting in a high degree of irreproducibility of the tracer diffusion for different realisations of the disorder .",
    "this is also quantified in panel f of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] ( see below ) and leads to substantially larger uncertainties in the local scaling exponent @xmath66 computed from the available msd curves .",
    "the strong effect of small crowders on the msd and the minor effect of the large crowders is our first main result .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the time averaged msd obtained from averaging over @xmath68 tracer trajectories for a single realisation of the crowder configuration .",
    "as shown in panel e of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] for large crowders with @xmath58 and small crowding fractions @xmath18 the spread of amplitudes of the time averaged msd curves is quite small . at later times , when the tracer motion starts to be influenced by the outer boundary the average @xmath69 approaches a plateau which has about twice the amplitude of the plateau value of the ensemble averaged msd , see panel e in figure [ fig - msd - homo ] . note that because of the relatively small domain size used in the simulations , the moderate trajectory lengths , and the presence of randomly distributed crowders this plateau is not as distinct as , for instance , for the deterministic , confined hdp , compare figure 4 in reference @xcite and figure 8 in reference @xcite .",
    "we recall that for the uncrowded case the long time ( plateau ) values of the ensemble and time averaged msds are related to the inner and outer radii in two dimensions as @xmath70    the occurrence of the factor @xmath71 for the time averaged msd is inherent to the very definition ( [ eq - tamsd - average ] ) @xcite .",
    "the asymptote ( [ eq - msd - plateau ] ) is shown in panel e of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] by the dotted line .",
    "the attainment of a plateau value of both ensemble and time averaged msds on a bounded domain is a typical feature of both ergodic processes such as brownian motion and fractional brownian motion as well as weakly non - ergodic processes , and is thus inherently different from the deviations from a plateau value in confining potentials @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these observations , for small crowders at high crowding fractions ( @xmath72 ) the amplitude spread of the time averaged msd curves for a particular distribution of crowders is quite pronounced , as shown in panel f of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] .",
    "the magnitude of the time averaged msd is much smaller than that for larger crowders , compare the magnitude of the time averaged msd in panels e and f of figure [ fig - msd - homo ] .",
    "in fact , time averaged msd curves with very small magnitudes ( below @xmath73 ) resulted from almost immobile finite size tracers that were blocked by surrounding crowders .",
    "moreover , the tracer only rarely reaches the outer cell membrane but mostly saturates at much lower values due to confinement by the crowders in a subdomain of our model cell .",
    "the msd itself features a much more pronounced amplitude scatter for the same number @xmath52 of traces used in the averaging . because of the tracer localisation and the wide amplitude spread of the time averaged msds the mean time averaged msd @xmath57 has poor statistics and its relation to the ensemble averaged msd prescribed by equation ( [ eq - msd - plateau ] ) is difficult to check .",
    "this behaviour of the time averaged msd in homogeneous crowding environments is our second main result .",
    "how does a heterogeneous distribution of crowders affect the above results ?",
    "an immediate effect of the heterogeneous distribution consists in very different properties for the in - out ( from the nucleus surface to the membrane ) and out - in ( from the membrane to the nucleus ) scenarios of the tracer diffusion .",
    "the average local density of crowders in the simulation domain ( see panels c and d of figure [ fig - scheme ] ) is generated according to equation ( [ eq - rho - sub ] ) which naturally leads to a higher local diffusivity close to the nucleus that corresponds to the experimentally relevant diffusion of small proteins inside surface adhered eukaryotic cells @xcite .    , and time averaged msd for tracer particles diffusing in heterogeneous crowder distributions of the form ( [ eq - rho - sub ] ) .",
    "the two columns correspond to the in - out and out - in tracer diffusion , that is , respectively , for the release of the tracer particle at the inner and outer radii of the model cell .",
    "the data for different crowder radii @xmath17 are shown by different symbols in panels a - d . in panels",
    "a and b the dashed lines indicate the ballistic asymptote at short times and the linear brownian regime at intermediate times . in panels e and f the long time plateau of the msd for the uncrowded case given by the asymptote ( [ eq - msd - plateau ] )",
    "is shown by the dashed line .",
    "parameters : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76.,width=529 ]    for the in - out diffusion from the nucleus to the cell periphery the tracers become trapped in progressively denser arrangements of crowders . at the same crowding fraction @xmath18 ,",
    "these trapping situations arise earlier in time for smaller crowders as compared to larger crowders , compare the panels c in figure [ fig - scheme ] .",
    "similar to the homogeneous case the msd starts ballistically , then reveals a linear brownian regime , and finally saturates due to the confinement in the annulus .",
    "concurrently , the local scaling exponent @xmath66 decreases continuously and finally vanishes when the msd approaches a plateau , see panels a and c of figure [ fig - msd - hetero ] .",
    "the spread of the time averaged msd curves is relatively small and their long time plateau is again about twice of that of the ensemble averaged msd for a particular crowder configuration , as expected from relation ( [ eq - msd - plateau ] ) and seen in panels e of figures [ fig - msd - homo ] and [ fig - msd - hetero ] . at intermediate times a stronger disparity between the ensemble and time averaged msd is observed when compared to the homogeneous case , as shown in panel e of figure [ fig - msd - hetero ] .",
    "the scatter of the time averaged msd curves decreases when longer trajectories ( larger @xmath50 values ) are analysed ( results not shown ) .",
    "this behaviour is expected and is realised for several ergodic and nearly ergodic processes @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the amplitude scatter of the time averaged msds in panels e of figures [ fig - msd - homo ] and [ fig - msd - hetero ] is similar to that of brownian motion @xcite .    in the opposite case of out - in diffusion ( panel d of figure [ fig - scheme ] )",
    "we observe that for relatively high crowding fractions of small crowders a finite size tracer often can not even leave the vicinity of the boundary , giving rise to prolonged trapping events in this confined area .",
    "this leads to a large proportion of low amplitude , nearly constant time averaged msd curves , as seen in panel f of figure [ fig - msd - hetero ] .",
    "the magnitude of the mean time averaged @xmath77 is in many cases dominated by several successful fast translocation events of tracers from the cell membrane to the nucleus . in the long time limit equation ( [ eq - msd - plateau ] ) is thus not valid in this situation .",
    "the tracer localisation and the dominance of one or few extreme tracer trajectories in the mean value @xmath78 is also a rather common feature of stochastic processes in the presence of well pronounced traps as well as in ageing stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "the distinctly different behaviour between out - in and in - out diffusion in our heterogeneous crowder system is the third main results of this study .",
    "since the crowding fraction in equation ( [ eq - rho - sub ] ) grows from the nucleus towards the cell periphery , the in - out diffusion in such heterogeneous crowders distribution is expected to be subdiffusive @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the tracers are progressively trapped closer to the cell periphery . here",
    ", however , we observe the formation of a radial percolation in the circular domain : the tracers are not allowed to penetrate beyond some critical radius that features a particular critical density of crowders , an effect that is crucially related to the finite size of both the crowders and the tracer particle .",
    "similar effects of local confinement are naturally observed for single particle trajectories of tracer diffusion in random percolation systems @xcite .",
    "the initial period of the tracer diffusion that occurs in the region with low crowder density is naturally reproducible and leads to a small spread of the time averaged msd curves , as shown in panel e of figure [ fig - msd - hetero ] .    in contrast , for the out - in diffusion the tracer starts in the region of the highest concentration of crowders and diffuses into regions containing less and less crowders .",
    "the associated initial tracer localisation events give rise to stalling time averaged msd curves with a very large spread , see panel f of figure [ fig - msd - hetero ] .",
    "early trapping in this scenario leads to the emergence of a longer plateau region in the corresponding time averaged msd curve .",

    "we observe that the differences between the two averaging approaches are rather small : the single average over @xmath68 trajectories and the double average over @xmath84 trajectories and @xmath84 crowder distributions yield very similar results .",
    "we checked that for homogeneously distributed crowders the radial tracer diffusivity is approximately constant ( panel a of figure [ fig - dr ] ) , as it should be . in turn , for a heterogeneous distribution of crowders given by equation ( [ eq - rho - sub ] ) the radial tracer diffusivity is a decreasing and nearly linear function of the distance from the nucleus ( panel b of figure [ fig - dr ] ) , @xmath85 the slope @xmath86 is nearly independent on the crowder radius @xmath17 .",

    "this is a typical long time behaviour of ergodic tracer diffusion , compare figure 3a in reference @xcite . indeed , as we show in panel e of figure [ fig - msd - hetero ] in the long time limit the ensemble and time averaged msds differ simply by the above mentioned factor of 2 for heterogeneous crowder distributions .",
    "in contrast for out - in diffusion the non - gaussianity parameter attains substantially larger values .",

    "the asymptote @xmath103 from ( [ eq - surv - scaling - in - out ] ) is shown in panels a and b. different colours indicate @xmath96 for various distances @xmath104 from the cell centre within which the tracers are counted .",
    "neither the inner boundary at @xmath105 nor the outer boundary at varying radius @xmath97 are absorbing in the simulations .",
    "the model parameters for homogeneous and heterogeneous crowder configurations are the same as in figures [ fig - msd - homo ] and [ fig - msd - hetero ] , respectively.,width=604 ]     but computed for the effective radial diffusivity @xmath101 from figure [ fig - dr ] .",
    "the asymptote @xmath103 is shown in panels a and b.,width=604 ]",
    "the cytoplasm of living cells is a complex , superdense @xcite mixture of various molecules of highly variable sizes , shapes , and surface properties , with often non - trivial spatial density distributions @xcite . the passive diffusion of proteins such as transcription factors or enzymes , as well as other complex signalling molecules in living cells represents a vital ingredient in the cellular gene regulation and metabolism @xcite .",
    "for instance , transcription factors that are taken up by the cell at its boundary need to diffuse to the nucleus , in which they will control the information transfer of certain genes .",
    "conversely , viral components may be produced in the nucleus and are then transported by thermal diffusion ( while larger parts are actively by molecular motors ) to the cell membrane , where the assembly process of these viruses takes place @xcite .",
    "the reverse process is , inter alia , relevant for the transport of internalised viruses to the nucleus @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies of the motion of relatively small green fluorescent proteins ( gfps ) in both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of living eukaryotic cells indeed demonstrate the existence of subdiffusion up to the millisecond range @xcite , concurrent to the existence of significant diffusivity gradients experienced by smaller proteins @xcite .    in earlier works , the spatial heterogeneity was often modelled through a space - dependent diffusivity . in particular , the implications of spatially heterogeneous diffusion processes ( hdps ) with a prescribed gradient of the diffusion coefficient @xmath106 were studied on the basis of the overdamped langevin equation for different functional forms of @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "these deterministic forms prescribe a systematic variation of the local particle diffusivity , similar to diffusivity maps in living cells @xcite , and are thus inherently different from spatially and temporally _ random _ diffusivities @xcite .",
    "in particular , hdps in a circular planar cell model with a radial diffusivity of the form @xmath100 exhibit radial subdiffusion with an anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath107 .",
    "in contrast to brownian motion , the hdps are weakly non - ergodic in the sense that time averages of physical observables such as the particle mean squared displacement do not converge to the corresponding ensemble averages even in the limit of long observation times @xcite .    in order to reveal the effect of molecular heterogeneity onto the intracellular transport",
    ", we performed extensive langevin dynamics simulations of the motion of a passive tracer of a finite size in a two dimensional quenched disordered environment in which crowders are either homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed .",
    "the simulation domain was an annulus , which was limited by concentric inner and outer boundaries , representing the surface of the nucleus and the plasma membrane of the cell .",
    "for varying crowding fraction and crowder size we quantified the motion of the tracer in the cell in terms of the diffusion profiles , the ensemble averaged msd and the associated scaling exponent , as well as the time averaged msd and the amplitude scatter observed for individual tracer trajectories .",
    "finally , we also determined the degree of the non - gaussian behaviour and the van hove correlation function , as well as the survival statistics of the tracer .",
    "most theoretical and even numerical studies of the intracellular transport dealt with a point like tracer as studied , for instance , in reference @xcite . in that case , one would expect that smaller crowders impede the tracer diffusion less , as the tracer can always pass through even small gaps between the crowders . in turn , the point tracer would have to navigate around larger crowders and thus be affected more severely . as we showed here",
    "the opposite effect occurs for a tracer of a finite size comparable to the size of the crowders . in this case",
    "many small crowders significantly hamper the spreading of the tracer as compared to larger crowders at the same crowding fraction @xmath18",
    ". moreover , the van hove correlation function acquires an exponential shape at higher crowding fractions and small crowders , whereas the van hove correlation function is approximately gaussian and quite insensitive to the crowding fraction for large crowders .",
    "concurrent to this effect we observe for larger , homogeneously distributed crowders an extended brownian regime of the ensemble averaged msd , whose magnitude is almost independent of the crowding fraction within the investigated range . the time averaged msd in this case is also highly reproducible . for smaller crowders ,",
    "however , anomalous diffusion effects in the ensemble averaged msd occur and become more severe as @xmath18 increases . additionally , individual time averaged msd curves demonstrate the early immobilisation of the tracer particles in the quenched landscape , corresponding to the crossing of a local percolation threshold for the tracer motion . in summary , when the tracer and crowder sizes are comparable , new dynamical features emerge as compared to conventional models with point like tracers .",
    "similar effects were observed for heterogeneously distributed crowders . due to the deterministic gradient of the crowder distribution , two scenarios of in - out and out - in diffusion",
    "were distinguished depending on the location in which the tracer particle was released : either at the nucleus envelope or at the cell boundary .",
    "the in - out case resembles in many aspects the homogeneous case : the spread of the time averaged msd is small , the van hove correlation function is close to gaussian and weakly depends on the crowder size , and the survival probability exhibits the characteristic square root decay at intermediate times . in contrast , the out - in case is marked by a highly non - gaussian diffusion of the tracer : high values of the non - gaussianity parameter and a pronounced cusp in the van hove correlation function near @xmath94 reveal a prevalence of small displacements .",
    "this is characteristic for subdiffusive processes .",
    "concurrently , the survival probability exhibits a very slow decay and tends to saturate at large values reflecting the dominating fraction of crowder configurations that block the tracer near the release point at the cell periphery . as a consequence ,",
    "the computed averages over tracer trajectories are dominated by few successful translocation events .",
    "in summary , our study revealed several important features for the tracer motion in a quenched disordered landscape , and is therefore also of interest from a purely statistical mechanical point of view .",
    "possible applications of our results in the fields of biological or soft matter physics concern the diffusion of tracer particles or globular proteins in the heterogeneously crowded cytoplasmic fluid of surface adhering ( flat ) cells .    in order to focus on the effects of the finite size of the tracer particle and heterogeneous distributions of crowders , some other biologically relevant features of living cells were ignored .",
    "we investigated the effect of immobile crowders . on the time scale of the motion of many passive tracers architectural elements of the cell such as parts of the cytoskeleton or organelles",
    "may indeed be viewed immobile .",
    "even large lipids or insulin granules are almost localised on such time scales @xcite .",
    "however , the motion of small crowders may be relevant as the effects such as the complete blocking of the tracer motion will be impeded . as shown recently the major effect of small mobile crowders",
    "is the increase of the effective viscosity experienced by the tracer particle @xcite . in the present study we also neglected hydrodynamic interactions between the tracer and the crowders @xcite which may affect the long time behaviour of the system .",
    "the slow , @xmath108 decay of these hydrodynamic coupling forces implies that a diffusing particle is impacted by crowders from a finite distance that helps avoiding to collide with the crowders .",
    "altering local pathways hydrodynamic forces may thus modify the diffusion statistics .",
    "accounting for these interactions presents an interesting perspective .",
    "other extensions of the current model include polydisperse static or dynamic crowders @xcite , cylindrical domains mimicking typical bacterial shapes @xcite , specific tracer - crowders interactions @xcite , three dimensional simulations , variable tracer size , and soft polymeric crowders @xcite .",
