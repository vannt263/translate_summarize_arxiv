    "compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite has emerged as a powerful and effective tool towards producing sparse signal representations .",
    "cs provides stable recovery of a sparse signal form an under - determined linear system of equations .",
    "performance of several sparse recovery algorithms like basis pursuit ( bp ) and orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) depends on the coherence of the underlying frame .",
    "frames that satisfy the restricted isometry property ( rip ) @xcite are known to allow for exact recovery of sparse signals from a few of their linear measurements . however , in general , it is computationally hard to verify the restricted isometry property ( rip ) of a given frame .",
    "in contrast , the coherence ( the largest absolute normalized inner product between two distinct columns ) of a frame is an easily computable quantity that asserts rip up to certain order @xcite .",
    "frames with small coherence are said to be incoherent . for a fixed number of elements , frames with the smallest coherence",
    "are called grassmannian @xcite . the lowest bound on the minimal achievable correlation for any frame , known as welch bound @xcite ,",
    "is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dimension of the ambient space and @xmath2 is the number of frame elements .",
    "incoherent frames and especially incoherent unit norm tight frames ( untfs ) play a significant role due to their ability in providing stable , sparse representations and effectiveness in the construction of signature sequences in cdma systems @xcite . however , construction of such frames is known to be very difficult .    in @xcite , j. tropp et.al . , and",
    "m. elad have used an alternating projection method to produce incoherent frames . in  @xcite , c. rusu et .",

    "al . have proposed an iterative process on the gram matrix of @xmath3 to obtain an incoherent untf .    in @xcite ,",
    "a preconditioning technique has been employed to design an incoherent unit norm frame via shrinkage operation on the off - diagonal entries of the gram matrix of @xmath3 and the incoherent unit norm frame so obtained is near to an untf .",
    "the technique may be summarized as follows : the initial frame @xmath3 is premultiplied by a gaussian matrix @xmath4 followed by a normalization step .",
    "then the gram matrix @xmath5 of @xmath6 is formed and the shrinkage operation , decimating the entries above @xmath7 in magnitude , is applied on @xmath5 to form @xmath8 .",
    "subsequently , the premultiplier @xmath9 is obtained from @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the best rank-@xmath1 approximation of @xmath8 .",
    "this process is repeated iteratively for generating incoherent frames .",
    "this method , however , is not known to provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the iterative process .    in many applications , the sensing matrix may not match with the incoherent frames developed by existing methods mentioned above . while these methods focus on constructing incoherent frames directly , we approach this problem from the perspective of an already existing linear system and develop incoherent frames via preconditioning .",
    "coherence of @xmath6 is in general a non - convex function in @xmath4 for a given frame @xmath3 .",
    "however , under the condition that @xmath6 is a unit norm frame , the optimization problem becomes tractable ( in fact , it becomes a semi - definite program ( sdp ) ) . in the case of noisy observations ,",
    "in addition to small coherence , it is also desirable to obtain a preconditioner which has a small condition number .",
    "this problem can also be formulated as an sdp .",
    "besides formulating the sdp problems , in this paper , we also give a sufficient condition for the existence of an invertible @xmath4 so that there is a strict fall in coherence , i.e. @xmath12 the condition can be verified by checking a linear system of equations for infeasibility .",
    "preconditioning may affect the performance guarantees of omp but bp remains unaffected . however , the existing coherence based bounds for bp can be enlarged using the idea of preconditioning . in the case where @xmath4 is diagonal",
    ", results from frame theory give analytical conditions for strict fall in coherence as opposed to the sufficient conditions in the general case .    the paper is organized in several sections . in section 2 ,",
    "we provide basics of frame theory and compressed sensing . in sections 3 and 4 , we present the effect of preconditioning on sparse recovery algorithms and our proposed convex optimization method respectively . in sections 5 and 6 , we study respectively the analysis of optimal solution of the semidefinite programming ( sdp ) problem and the proposed convex optimization to obtain preconditioner in noisy cases . in section 7",

    ", the area of frames has become an active area of research for many researchers from several fields . in signal processing , frames play a significant role in sparse signal recovery @xcite .    a family of vectors @xmath13 in @xmath14 is called a frame for @xmath14 , if there exist constants @xmath15 such that @xmath16 where @xmath17 are called the lower and upper frame bounds respectively @xcite .",

    "the adjoint of synthesis operator @xmath3 is known as analysis operator @xmath20 .",
    "the frame operator @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 in this paper we refer to @xmath3 as a frame and also as a matrix depending on the context .",
    "frames are characterized depending on their properties as outlined below :    * if @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is an @xmath25tight frame or simply a tight frame . *",
    "if there exists a constant @xmath26 such that @xmath27 for @xmath28 then @xmath24 is an equiangular frame .",
    "* if there exits a constant @xmath29 such that @xmath30 for all @xmath31 then @xmath24 is an equal norm frame .",

    "if a frame is both untf and equiangular , it is called an equiangular tight frame ( etf ) .",
    "untfs are an important class of frames as they have good conditioning and provide stable representation . for a given frame @xmath3 ,",

    "one may use greedy methods  @xcite or convex relaxation of @xmath47 problem to recover the @xmath48-sparse signal @xmath49 ( that is , @xmath50 ) .",
    "the convex relaxation of @xmath47 problem can be posed as  @xcite ,  @xcite , @xmath51 candes and tao @xcite have introduced the following isometry condition on matrices @xmath3 and have shown that it results in sufficient conditions for exact recovery .",

    "the following theorem @xcite establishes the equivalence between @xmath59 and @xmath60 problems :    suppose an @xmath52 matrix @xmath3 has the @xmath61 restricted isometry property with @xmath62 , then @xmath59 and @xmath60 have the same @xmath63sparse solution if @xmath59 has a @xmath63sparse solution .",

    "the above relation indicates that our desire to have smaller @xmath53 is achievable by producing matrices with smaller coherence .",
    "it is to be noted however that there exist fundamental limitations in constructing matrices with large rip orders using coherence based arguments @xcite .",
    "coherence based techniques are used in establishing the guaranteed recovery of sparse signals via orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) or basis pursuit ( bp ) , as summarized by the following result @xcite .",

    "omp is an iterative greedy algorithm by nature .",
    "it selects at every iteration the frame element which has the maximum correlation with the residual at that step and provides an orthogonal projection of the signal on the space spanned by the already selected frame atoms . in general , when omp is used , the solutions of @xmath47 and @xmath74 may not be the same .",
    "it can also be noted that the bounds in ( [ eq : omp_bound ] ) may also differ as @xmath3 and @xmath6 can have different coherences .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath75 is typically solved as a linear program , the solutions of @xmath69 and @xmath75 remain the same . in view of bounds such as ( [ eq : omp_bound ] )",
    ", one obtains better theoretical guarantee for the system possessing @xmath76 as its underlying sensing matrix , where @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 consequently , any @xmath63sparse solution of @xmath79 can be uniquely recovered whenever @xmath80 as @xmath69 and @xmath81 are equivalent , this implies that any @xmath63sparse solution of @xmath82 can also be uniquely recovered whenever the above bound is satisfied .",
    "this can be summarized by the following theorem .",
    "[ eq : newbound ] let @xmath83 and assume that @xmath84 is well defined .",

    "in other words , for @xmath48 lying between the values on the right hand sides of ( [ eq : omp_bound ] ) and ( [ eq : bp_bound ] ) , omp run on @xmath42 and @xmath94 may yield different support sets .",
    "in this section , starting from a frame @xmath95 , we discuss our methodology towards designing a suitable preconditioner that acts on @xmath3 to produce a new frame with smaller coherence . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is an unit norm frame , that is , @xmath96    for a given frame @xmath97 the problem of finding a preconditioner @xmath4 that yields an incoherent frame @xmath98 may be posed in the following manner : @xmath99 it can be noted that @xmath100 is a non - convex problem in general due to the denominator terms involving @xmath4 in the expression for coherence .",
    "however , with the assumption of unit norm condition , @xmath101 the relaxed @xmath100 problem , i.e. , @xmath102 becomes tractable .",
