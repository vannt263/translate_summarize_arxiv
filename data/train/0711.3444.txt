    "experimentally , this regime is only accessible with dielectrons ( and after subtraction of the @xmath517 dalitz decay ) , and the first hint from data is consistent with the theoretical yield .",
    "clearly , it would be very worthwhile to further explore this region .",
    "in the present paper , we have conducted a quantitative study of dilepton spectra in semi-/central heavy - ion collisions at full sps energy ( @xmath134  gev ) .",
    "we have supplemented our earlier calculations of thermal radiation ( which reproduce available mass spectra ) with sources of non - thermal origin ( expected to become relevant at high transverse momentum and for small systems ) , and we have scrutinized the results with respect to hadro - chemical and flow properties of the underlying thermal fireball expansion .    the key quantity to describe thermal dilepton rates is the ( imaginary part of the ) electromagnetic current correlator . in hadronic matter , we have evaluated its medium modifications in terms of many - body spectral functions for the light vector mesons at low mass , and chiral vector - axialvector mixing for the continuum part at intermediate mass .",
    "partonic emission above @xmath32 has been approximated by perturbative quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "an appealing feature of this description is a smooth merging of the hadronic rates with the partonic ones at temperatures around the expected phase transition , @xmath518-@xmath30  mev . as a new ingredient",
    "we have computed thermal dilepton rates induced by @xmath7-channel meson exchange in @xmath519 reactions , which we found to become relevant at momenta above @xmath11@xmath190  gev .",
    "we have augmented our approach by non - thermal sources , _",
    "i.e. _ , drell - yan annihilation , as well as decays of @xmath1 mesons from primordial production ( subject to jet quenching ) and from decoupling at thermal freezeout .",
    "we have emphasized that these @xmath1 decays carry an extra kinematic lorentz-@xmath217 factor relative to thermal radiation , resulting in harder dilepton-@xmath5 spectra .",
    "all sources have been implemented into a space - time evolution for @xmath187-@xmath187 collisions at sps , for which we employed an isentropic fireball model with qgp , mixed and hadron - gas phases and updated expansion parameters to better match the absolute dilepton yields measured by na60 .",
    "hadrochemical freezeout and subsequent evolution are constructed in line with measured hadron multiplicities .",
    "the calculated dimuon invariant - mass spectra agree well with na60 data in central and semicentral in - in collisions , including @xmath5 bins below @xmath520  gev and above @xmath470  gev , thus confirming our earlier results for thermal emission and validating the predicted in - medium vector spectral functions ( dominated , but not exhausted , by the @xmath1 ) .",
    "when comparing to @xmath5 spectra , the new sources contribute to provide good agreement for central collisions , while discrepancies persist with semicentral data at @xmath521 for masses around and below the free @xmath1 mass .",
    "in particular , effective slope parameters for @xmath522 amount to @xmath523-@xmath514  mev , @xmath11@xmath524 short of the empirically extracted values in the lmr .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of our results to variations in the critical and chemical - freezeout temperature of the fireball .",
    "the spectral shape of the invariant - mass spectra turned out to be insensitive for the range @xmath525  mev .",
    "the reason is the `` duality '' of the thermal emission rates around @xmath32 , rendering the `` melting '' of the @xmath1 meson a robust signal .",
    "a low value of @xmath518  mev entails that qgp radiation dominates over hadronic emission in the imr . a low value of @xmath348  mev implies smaller pion chemical potentials ( and thus higher temperatures ) in the hadronic evolution , increasing the effective slope parameters by about 15 - 20  mev , still @xmath1130  mev short of the data in the lmr .",
    "in an attempt to resolve this discrepancy , we have implemented a @xmath11@xmath449 increase in the transverse fireball acceleration as previously employed for central au - au collisions at rhic energy .",
    "this elevates the slope to @xmath11@xmath526  mev around the free @xmath1 mass ( and properly reproduces the increase below ) , while still being consistent with the ( upper ) experimental value of @xmath527  mev in the imr where the blue shift effect is less pronounced due to the prevalently early emission .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that , within the current theoretical and experimental uncertainties , _ both _",
    "scenarios for a predominant emission source in the imr ",
    "hadronic ( four - pion ) or partonic  are viable . in either case , the radiation mostly emanates from matter at temperatures around @xmath528  mev .",
    "an unambiguous distinction between a partonic and hadronic source in the imr therefore appears difficult at sps energies . the larger transverse flow developed in the partonic stage at rhic energies could facilitate this task  @xcite , although additional complications arise due to the much larger open - charm contribution and its in - medium modifications .",
    "finally we have checked that our refined assessment of dilepton sources , together with the improvements in the fireball expansion , preserves our previously found agreement with the ceres / na45 dielectron spectra in pb - au collisions .",
    "the larger system size leads to an appreciable increase in thermal radiation , thus reducing the uncertainties associated with the modeling of the break - up stage .",
    "in addition , dielectrons allow access to the mass region below the two - pion threshold , where the medium effects on the @xmath1-spectral function , augmented by the thermal bose factor ( and photon propagator ) , predict a large thermal dilepton signal .",
    "first data in this region support this signal , and further corroborate the importance of baryonic interactions for the in - medium @xmath1 spectral function .",
    "future efforts should be pursued along several directions : first and foremost , the theoretically calculated vector spectral functions must be extended to their chiral partners ( most notably the axialvector ( @xmath63 ) channel as the partner of the @xmath1 ) , to establish direct connections to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the evaluation of in - medium weinberg sum rules  @xcite , in connection with constraints from lattice qcd , will play an important role in this enterprise  @xcite .",
    "second , from the phenomenological side , the implementation of emission rates into both hydrodynamic and transport simulations should be reiterated , to compute @xmath5 spectra and check whether the rather large acceleration of the fireball model can be justified for the in - in system at sps .",
    "the study of dilepton elliptic flow  @xcite could shed further light on the time profile of the radiation . at rhic energies ,",
    "partonic collectivity increases significantly ; an unexpectedly large dilepton excess in the lmr recently observed by phenix needs to be understood  @xcite .",
    "work in several of these directions is in progress .",
    "we are grateful to s.  damjanovic and h.  j.  specht for discussion and information on the na60 acceptance , and to a. marin for providing us with the new ceres data .",
