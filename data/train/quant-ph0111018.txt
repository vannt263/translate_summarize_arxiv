    "we now consider destabilizing dark states in the @xmath173 level by modulating the repumping laser polarization . in this system , as in every other except the system , it is sufficient to use a field having only two polarization components with different time dependences .",

    "another easily - realized modulation scheme gives the @xmath235 and @xmath236 polarization components different frequencies .",
    "the beam can be split into right- and left - hand circular polarization components separately shifted in frequency with two aom s , to create the field @xmath237 although it is not necessary that @xmath139 , this symmetrical modulation most effectively destabilizes the dark state .",

    "we consider what happens when the short - term linewidth @xmath242 of either laser is larger than the decay rate @xmath58 .",
    "this situation can be incorporated into the simulation by selectively increasing the decay rate of the optical coherences on the relevant transitions .",
    "the dark superpositions of @xmath172 and @xmath173 states are then unstable , so that the depth of the dark resonances is reduced , which in turn simplifies the destabilization problem .",
    "this point is of some practical importance because the repumping transition in @xmath169 is often driven with a multi - mode fiber laser whose linewidth is many times @xmath58 .",
    "we find in this case that the line shapes of both transitions remain symmetric and structureless as long as @xmath243 ( where here @xmath178 is the rabi frequency for a single - mode repumping laser of the same intensity ) .",
    "the intensity of the broadband repumping laser intensity should then simply be increased , subject to this limit , to maximize the excited state population .",
    "the rate at which the atom is pumped into the @xmath244 dark states is then determined by the intensity of the cooling laser , and so the other parameters should be set as discussed above : the magnetic field or polarization modulation frequency should make the state evolution rate @xmath59 less than the linewidth @xmath58 and comparable to the cooling transition rabi frequency @xmath176 .",
    "the multi - mode nature of the fibre laser also makes possible a particularly convenient form of polarization modulation on the transition @xcite .",
    "a superposition of two fiber laser beams having different polarization vectors produces a field whose direction changes on the time scale corresponding to the laser mode spacing",
    ". this interval can be comparable to @xmath58 , with the result that the simple two - beam arrangement can effectively destabilize the @xmath173 dark states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig9 ] ) without magnetic fields or modulators .",
    "the responses of the and systems to the destabilization techniques discussed above are strikingly similar .",
    "this observation leads us in this section to consider atoms with higher angular momentum , to demonstrate that the behavior seen in those systems is for the most part quite general . for reasons of computational simplicity ,",
    "we consider only the destabilization of dark states with a magnetic field , noting that we have seen in the previous sections that the response to polarization modulation is expected to be similar .",
    "we consider here a two - level atom with an @xmath245 ground state and a @xmath246 excited state .",
    "we assume the nuclear spin is zero and vary the electronic spin @xmath247 to increase the total angular momentum , so these generic atoms have no hyperfine structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig10 ] shows the numerically calculated total population @xmath92 of the @xmath246 levels as a function of magnetic field , with linear laser polarization and polarization angle @xmath97 .",
    "the laser is tuned to resonance , and its intensity gives an rms rabi frequency @xmath157 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : j10vsangle ] .",
    "the graphs in this figure all show that the excited state population is large when @xmath248 . in graph ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , the excited state populations do not vanish when @xmath241 approaches zero , since the half - integer @xmath249 transitions have no dark state .",
    "however , in these transitions the excited state populations can still be increased by applying a magnetic field , especially when @xmath250 is large .",
    "curves ( b ) ",
    "( d ) display two simple scaling laws : the excited state population falls off like 1/@xmath251 when @xmath252 because the atomic transition becomes zeeman broadened , and it grows as @xmath251 in the regime @xmath253 as the pumping out of the dark state(s ) becomes more efficient .",
    "these three curves also show that as @xmath250 increases , the region in which the excited state population is large expands to include smaller values of @xmath241 .",
    "this is because increasing the number of states in the system increases the time needed for optical pumping into a dark state , and so the dark state evolution rate @xmath59 can be smaller .",
    "similarly , had the laser been detuned from resonance then the excited state population would be relatively constant over a range that includes smaller values of @xmath59 , because the atom would pump into the dark states less rapidly .",
    "we find that the calculations resulting in fig .",
    "[ fig : j10widthandheight ] for the width and excited state population in the transition give very similar results ( not shown here ) for these other two - level transitions .",
    "in real atoms , large values of the total angular momentum are usually due to the presence of nuclear spin . in this case",
    "the @xmath254-factors of the atomic levels involved will be different than those used in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , which mostly results in a simple shift along the @xmath255-axis of the appropriate curve . more importantly ,",
    "when the nuclear spin is not zero the atom can be optically pumped into hyperfine levels which do not absorb light from the laser field .",
    "this leads to situations which are similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3lambda ] , with a repumping mechanism being needed to return the atom to the light state .",
    "there are several ways of accomplishing this .",
    "corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig:3lambda](a ) , an rf or microwave field can drive transitions between the ground state hyperfine levels , or a second laser field can pump the atom out of the extra ground state hyperfine level through an auxiliary excited state .",
    "corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig:3lambda](b ) , a repumping laser field can couple the dark state to the same excited states as the main laser .",
    "for all of these cases the conclusions are the same as in the previous sections : the rate at which the atom is pumped out of the dark hyperfine level must be as large as possible without exaggerating coherence effects such as dark resonances .",
    "this means that the polarization of the radiation driving the transition out of the hyperfine states must be such that these hyperfine states do not have a stationary dark state , and that the intensity of this radiation must be great enough to drive the transition strongly .",
    "if these conditions are not met then the width of the primary transition will be broadened and the maximum scattering rate will be reduced .",
    "it it also useful to consider the opposite limit in which optical pumping into dark hyperfine states has little effect on the scattering process because the decay rate into these states is sufficiently slow . in this case",
    "it may be possible to detect the scattered photons with a time resolution which is much smaller than the decay time to the dark hyperfine level .",
    "the dark periods following decay into the dark state can then be selectively neglected , with the result that the lineshape of the strong transition will not be broadened , in contrast to the situation discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : j10bfield ] where only the average scattering rate was detected .",
    "another consequence of weak coupling to a dark hyperfine state is that the doppler - cooled atom may be able to reach equilibrium long before it decays into the dark state @xcite .",
    "the ultimate temperature of the atom will then be the same as if the atom had only two levels ( as long as the atom is not heated while it is in the dark state ) .",
    "in this paper we have discussed how the accumulation of atomic population in dark states can be prevented by either applying a static magnetic field or by modulating the polarization of the driving laser .",
    "we have also considered the effect of these destabilization techniques on transition lineshapes .",
    "the magnetic field technique is simple , but the more complex polarization modulation method has the important advantage of leaving the atomic energy levels unperturbed .",
    "several different atomic systems were analyzed , and their responses to both techniques were found to be quite similar ( compare figs .  [ fig : j10polmodave ] , [ fig : fig9 ] , and [ fig : fig10 ] ) .",
    "this universal behavior arises because the evolution is always governed by the same fundamental parameters : the state evolution rate @xmath59 ( given by the zeeman shift , the aom splitting , or the highest sideband frequency for the case of phase modulation ) , the rabi frequency @xmath22 , and the excited state decay rate @xmath58 .    for a given laser intensity ,",
    "the excited state population and the scattering rate are maximized by making @xmath59 comparable to @xmath22 ( typically @xmath60 ) .",
    "the excited state population will be small if @xmath256 because the atom is then able to follow the evolving dark state adiabatically , and it will be small if @xmath257 , either because the laser intensity is low ( @xmath98 ) or because the atom and the laser are detuned ( @xmath258 ) . if the transition linewidth is not important , then the scattering rate can be maximized by making @xmath22 ( and @xmath59 ) larger than @xmath58 , so that the transition is saturated .",
    "if the linewidth is important ( e.g. , in laser cooling applications ) , then the choice @xmath259 gives substantial excited state population without excessive broadening .",
    "the two regimes which give small excited state population ( @xmath109 and @xmath260 ) also result in broad lineshapes .",
    "fortunately , the evolution rate which optimizes the excited state population also minimizes the linewidth .",
    "if the system has more than two levels , then these rules apply to the extra transitions if they too are to remain narrow",
    ". however , often only one transition ( for example , a laser cooling transition ) must be narrow . in this case the extra transition should be driven as hard as possible if the system can not form dark resonances .",
    "if the system can form dark superposition states ( e.g. the system ) , then the intensities of the lasers should give rabi frequencies such that @xmath261 , to keep the dark resonances narrow .",
    "in addition , because the dark resonances occur when lasers are equally detuned from resonance , the laser frequencies can be set to keep them away from any region of interest .",

    "<S> we present a general discussion of the techniques of destabilizing dark states in laser - driven atoms with either a magnetic field or modulated laser polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the photon scattering rate is maximized at a particular evolution rate of the dark state . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the atomic resonance curve is significantly broadened when the evolution rate is far from this optimum value . </S>",
    "<S> these results are illustrated with detailed examples of destabilizing dark states in some commonly - trapped ions and supported by insights derived from numerical calculations and simple theoretical models . </S>"
