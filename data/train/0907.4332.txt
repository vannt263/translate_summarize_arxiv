    "the lunar cherenkov technique @xcite is a method to use radio - telescopes to detect ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( cr ) and neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) . by observing the short - duration ( @xmath3few nanosecond ) pulses of coherent cherenkov radiation emitted from particle cascades via the askaryan effect @xcite in the moon s outer layers ( nominally the regolith ) ,",
    "the primary particles initiating the cascades may be identified .",
    "our collaboration ( lunaska ) aims to develop the technique to be used with the next generation of giant radio - arrays . here , we present the results of our two preliminary uhe particle searches using this technique with three antennas at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) during february and may 2008 .",
    "we leave to another contribution ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) the details of our specialised equipment , and here concentrate on the results of our search for lunar cherenkov pulses .",
    "we first describe the observations , in which we targeted centaurus a and the galactic centre region , then detail the procedures used to discriminate between random noise events , rfi , and lunar - origin pulses .",
    "we calculate an effective aperture for our experiment to uhe @xmath2 , and since our pulse search could identify no lunar pulses , this aperture is used to set an upper limit on an isotropic flux of uhe neutrinos .",
    "finally , we calculate our exposure as a function of uhe @xmath2 arrival direction , and compare this exposure with the exposure to cen a and sgr a from other experiments . since we believe that current simulation techniques are inappropriate to modelling uhe cr hitting the moon , we leave a calculation of our aperture / limit to uhe cr to a later work @xcite .",
    "we implemented three of the six @xmath0  m atca antennas with our specialised pulse detection and dedispersion hardware , and observed over a continuous @xmath4  mhz band in dual linear polarisations between @xmath5 and @xmath6  ghz .",
    "this apparatus is described in greater detail in our other contribution ( ref .",
    "@xcite )  briefly , the equipment dedispersed , sampled ( @xmath7  ghz , @xmath8-bit ) , and scanned the data streams from both polarisations at each antenna for candidate pulses , and returned a data buffer of length @xmath9  samples upon detecting a signal greater than an adjustable threshold . a clock time accurate to @xmath10",
    "ns was also returned with each trigger .",
    "each antenna operated independently due to data transmission constraints  since this limited our sensitivity , we set each antenna to trigger at approximately @xmath11  hz ( @xmath12% dead - time ) to partially compensate .    a summary of our main observing runs and observation time in february and may 2008 is given in table [ obstbl ] .",
    "the february run was tailored to ` target ' a broad ( @xmath13 ) region of the sky near the galactic centre , harbouring the closest supermassive black hole to earth and potential accelerator of uhe cr ( or site of decaying super - heavy dark matter ) . for these runs",
    "we pointed the antennas towards the lunar centre , since this mode maximised coverage of the entire lunar limb , from which we expect to see the majority of pulses . in this mode , we achieved the greatest total effective aperture .",
    "our may observing period targeted centaurus a only , a nearby active galaxy which could potentially account for multiple uhe cr events as observed by the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "regardless of their source , this suggests the likelihood of an accompanying excess of uhe neutrinos , and we do not exclude the possibility of seeing the uhe cr themselves .",
    "we therefore pointed the antennas at that part of the lunar limb closest to cen a in order to maximise sensitivity to uhe particles from this region , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".observation dates ( nights thereof ) , total time @xmath14 , and effective observing time @xmath15 after subtracting trigger dead - time , spent observing the moon in detection mode of our observing runs . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have successfully used an array of small , wide - bandwidth antennas to search for uhe particles using the lunar cherenkov technique . that the limits on an isotropic flux are not competitive is expected , since these were only trial observations . however , the required observation time to set a competitive limit with the current system is probably impractical at this stage .",
    "we therefore concentrate our efforts on improving our sensitivity before conducting observations of serious length .",
    "the australia telescope compact array is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "this research was supported by the australian research council s discovery project funding scheme ( project numbers dp0559991 and dp0881006 ) .",
