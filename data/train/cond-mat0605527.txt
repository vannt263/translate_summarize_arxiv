    "in recent years , a large amount of work has been devoted to the study of small - world networks , mainly numerical @xcite with emphasis e.g. on biophysical networks @xcite-@xcite or social networks @xcite and , to a lesser extent , analytically @xcite . for recent reviews",
    "see e.g. @xcite- @xcite . by now , it has thus become apparent that small - world architectures can be found in many different circumstances , ranging from linguistic , epidemic and social networks to the world - wide - web .",
    "efficient modeling of real - world applications not only often requires a diluted random graph to describe the interaction network but , moreover , these interactions sometimes couple @xmath1-plets of agents .",
    "for instance , it has been found that the proteomic network of yeast forms a hypergraph with the proteins corresponding to vertices and the protein - complexes corresponding to hyperedges @xcite .",
    "other large metabolic networks like the one of _",
    "e. coli _ have also been found to possess a small - world structure and as most of the reactions of metabolism are multi - molecular they can be represented by hypergraphs @xcite .",
    "technical analysis of sparse hypergraphs is , however , involved even without superimposing small - world architectures .    a convenient way to describe the statistical physics of this type of systems is to consider diluted random graphs with @xmath0-spin interactions . in this context , a ferromagnetic model having @xmath2-spin interactions and finite connectivity has been considered recently in @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a complete description of a small - world system requires in addition local interactions .",
    "a simple example of the latter is the nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic ising interaction .",
    "the inclusion of such local interactions can completely change the functioning and the dynamics of such systems .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , e.g. , that this construction significantly enlarges the region in parameter space where ferromagnetism occurs .",
    "in particular , for any choice of the value of the average connectivity , however small , the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition occurs at a finite temperature .",
    "furthermore , a jump in the entropy of metastable configurations has been found @xcite exactly at the crossover between the small - world and the poisson random graph structure due to the formation of disconnected clusters within the graph .    in this work",
    "we study the thermodynamic properties of such a small - world hypergraph , obtained by superimposing sparse poisson random graphs with @xmath0-spin interactions onto a one - dimensional ising chain with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "an analytic study of this model is non - trivial .",
    "the relevant disorder - averaged free energy and order parameters are calculated using replica - symmetric transfer - matrix techniques .",
    "a set of fixed - point equations for the order parameter functions is derived and solved numerically with the population dynamics algorithm @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 we find back some of the results described in @xcite , @xcite , for @xmath4 the physics is different . in the limit where the number of long - range short - cuts are of the order of the system size for each site we get a mean - field model for which we are able to solve the order parameters in a completely analytic way , again using transfer matrices .",
    "first - order phase transitions from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phase are found for all values of @xmath0 , along with metastable ( spinodal ) transitions . additionally , for @xmath5 a second - order phase transition and a coexistence region between the two phases are found .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of the system employing glauber dynamics allow us to find the dynamic ( metastable ) transition - lines .",
    "very good agreement with the theory is found when the ising chain interactions are ferromagnetic .",
    "when they are anti - ferromagnetic we find that the dynamics becomes very slow , indicating critical slowing down in this region .",
