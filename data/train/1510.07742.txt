    "right : the evolute of an ellipse.,title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]    the evolute is always locally convex : it has no inflection points . if the curve @xmath0 has an inflection point then its evolute at this point escapes to infinity",
    ". we shall be mostly concerned with locally convex curves .",
    "typically , an evolute has cusp singularities , generically , semicubical , clearly visible in figure [ evolutedef ] .",
    "these cusps of @xmath1 correspond to the vertices of @xmath0 , the local extrema of its curvature .",
    "the evolute of a closed curve has total length zero .",
    "the length is algebraic : its sign changes each time that one passes a cusp .",
    "we shall consider a larger class of curves with cusp singularities called _ wave fronts_. a wave front is a piecewise smooth curve such that the tangent line is well defined at every point , including the singularities .. we do not use this point of view in the present paper . ] the construction of the evolute extends to wave fronts ( the curvature at cusp points is infinite , and the evolute of a wave front passes through its cusps ) .    a coorientation of a wave front is a continuous choice of a normal direction . unlike orientation , coorientation extends continuously through cusps .",
    "a cooriented closed wave front has an even number of cusps .",
    "a coorientation of @xmath0 provides orientation , and hence coorientation , of its normal lines , and as a result , a coorientation of the evolute @xmath1 .",
    "thus one can consider a transformation on the set of cooriented wave fronts : curve @xmath2 is mapped to its evolute @xmath3 .",
    "we shall call this mapping the _ evolute transformation _ and will use the notation @xmath4 .    consider the left figure [ evolutedef ] again .",
    "the curve @xmath0 is called an _",
    "involute _ of the curve @xmath1 : the involute is orthogonal to the tangent lines of a curve .",
    "the involute @xmath0 is described by the free end of a non - stretchable string whose other end is fixed on @xmath1 and which is wrapped around it ( accordingly , involutes are also called evolvents ) . changing the length of the string yields a 1-parameter family of involutes of a given curve",
    ". having zero length of @xmath0 is necessary and sufficient for the string construction to produce a closed curve .",
    "the relation between a curve and its evolute is similar to the relation between a periodic function and its derivative .",
    "a function has a unique derivative , but not every function is a derivative of a periodic function : for this , it should have zero average . and",
    "if it does , then the inverse derivative is defined up to a constant of integration .",
    "we shall see that this analogy is literally true for a certain class of plane wave fronts .",
    "in this paper we study two natural discretizations of the evolute construction to the case of polygons . both are discretizations of the fact that the evolute of a curve is the locus of centers of its osculating circles .",
    "we consider our study as a contribution to the emerging field of discrete differential geometry @xcite .",
    "replace the curve by a closed polygonal line @xmath5 .",
    "one may replace osculating circles by the circles that circumscribe the consecutive triples of vertices of @xmath5 .",
    "the centers of these circles form a new polygon , @xmath6 , which may be regarded as an evolute of @xmath5 . to perform this construction , we need to assume that no three consecutive vertices of @xmath5 are collinear . since these centers are the intersection points of the perpendicular bisectors of the consecutive sides of @xmath5 , we call @xmath6 the _ perpendicular bisector evolute or @xmath7-evolute _ of @xmath5 . this evolute was considered in the context of a discrete 4-vertex theorem @xcite .",
    "@xmath7-evolute of a polygon shares one additional property of the classical evolutes : it borrows the coorientation from this polygon .",
    "namely , a coorientation of a polygon consists of an arbitrary choice of coorientations ( equivalently : orientations ) of all sides .",
    "but the sides of @xmath8 are perpendicular bisectors of sides of @xmath5 , so a choice of a coorientation of a side of @xmath8 is the same as a choice of an orientation of the corresponding side of @xmath5 .",
    "equally well , one may consider the circles that are tangent to the consecutive triples of sides of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , for a given triple of lines , there are four such circles , so , if we make an arbitrary choice of these circles for every triple , then for an @xmath9-gon we will obtain as many as @xmath10 evolutes .    to narrow this variety of choices ,",
    "we notice that the center of a circle we consider is the intersection point of the angular bisectors of two consecutive angles of the polygon .",
    "since an angle has two bisectors , we can just make a choice of one of these two bisectors at every vertex of our polygon @xmath5 .",
    "this gives us @xmath11 evolutes , which are all called angular bisector evolutes or @xmath12-evolutes of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the sides of an @xmath12-evolute are the chosen bisectors of the angles of @xmath5 . to perform this construction",
    ", we need to assume that no two consecutive vertices of @xmath5 coincide and no two consecutive chosen bisectors are parallel .",
    "there are some choices of angle bisectors which may be regarded as natural .",
    "for example , one can take bisectors of _ interior _ angles ( this choice is used in figure [ hexagonexample ] ) .",
    "another choice is the choice of bisectors of _ exterior _ angles .",
    "other natural choices arise when the sides of @xmath5 are ( co)oriented ( see figure [ orbisector ] below ) .",
    "in this approach , the @xmath12-evolute of a polygon borrows a coorientation from this polygon .",
    "both versions of polygonal evolutes , along with the relative evolute of parallel polygons , are discussed in the book @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "they are also introduced in @xcite under the names of vertex and edge evolutes .",
    "for some ( randomly chosen ) hexagon @xmath5 the @xmath7- and @xmath12-evolutes are shown in figure [ hexagonexample ] .",
    "of a polygon @xmath5.,width=326 ]    it is seen that for a polygon with a small number of sides the two evolutes may look completely different ( but , certainly , for polygons approximating smooth curves , they will be close to each other ) .",
    "a polygon whose evolute is @xmath8 is called an involute of @xmath8 .",
    "a variety of definitions of the evolute gives rise to a variety of definitions of an involute .",
    "we will discuss this variety in section [ ap - inv ] .",
    "the polygonal involutes retain the most visible property of classical involutes : they exist only under an additional condition and are not unique .",
    "the main subject of this paper is the dynamics of the evolute and involute transformations for smooth and polygonal curves in the plane .",
    "section [ smooth ] is devoted to the smooth case .",
    "the curves in the plane which we study are closed cooriented wave fronts without inflections .",
    "the total turning angle of such curve is a multiple of @xmath13 .",
    "if it is @xmath13 , then we call the curve a _",
    "hedgehog_. if it is @xmath14 with @xmath15 , then the curve is called a _",
    "multi - hedgehog_.    it turns out that generically the number of cusps of consecutive evolutes grows without bounds .",
    "however , if the support function of a curve is a trigonometric polynomial of degree @xmath9 , then the limiting shape of its iterated evolute is that of a hypocycloid of order @xmath9 ( theorem [ growth ] ) .    a closed curve whose evolute is the given curve @xmath2 is called an involute of @xmath2 .",
    "a curve @xmath2 has an involute if and only if its total signed length is zero , and if this condition holds , then @xmath2 has a one parameter family of involutes .",
    "however , for a generic curve @xmath2 of zero signed length , precisely one involute also has zero signed length .",
    "we call this involute an _ evolvent _ , and the construction of the evolvent can be iterated .",
    "we observe that the iterated evolvents of a hedgehog converse to its curvature center , a.k.a .",
    "the steiner point , and the limit shape of the iterated evolvents of a hedgehog is a hypocycloid , generically an astroid ( theorem [ limhypo ] ) . we also provide analogs of these results for non - closed periodic curves , such as the classical cycloid . in particular , if such a curve differs from its evolute by a parallel translation then it is the cycloid .",
    "( theorem [ limcycl ] ) .",
    "sections [ polygonshedgehogs ]  [ ap - inv ] are devoted to polygonal versions of evolutes and involutes .",
    "it has been already pointed out in section [ discretization ] that there are two competing approaches to the discretization of the notion of an evolute : for an @xmath9-gon @xmath5 , its @xmath9-gonal evolute can be defined as having for sides the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of @xmath5 , or the bisectors of the angles of @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , we speak of @xmath7-evolutes and @xmath12-evolutes .",
    "there arise two different theories based on @xmath7- and @xmath12-approaches .",
    "it was also noted in section [ discretization ] that while a @xmath7-evolute of a given @xmath9-gon @xmath5 is well defined and unique , the number of different @xmath12-involutes of @xmath5 is @xmath11 ( or @xmath16 , this depends on the details of the definition ) .",
    "section [ polygonshedgehogs ] is technical : it provides a discretization of the support function ( which becomes , for an @xmath9-gon , an @xmath9-tuple @xmath17 with @xmath18 ) , their fourier series , hypocycloids , and steiner points ( which in some cases we have to replace with geometrically less clear  pseudo - steiner points \" ) .    the @xmath7-evolutes are studied in section [ p - evo ] .",
    "we notice that the @xmath7-evolute transformation acts on @xmath9-tuples @xmath19 in the following way : @xmath20 just becomes @xmath21 , while the components @xmath22 are transformed in a linear way ( depending on @xmath20 ) : we give an explicit description of these transformations ( theorem [ coordp ] ) .",
    "first , we apply these results to the discrete hypocycloids ( equiangular hedgehogs whose sides are tangent to a hypocycloid ) . in this case",
    ", we obtain a full geometric description of the @xmath7-evolute transformation ; in particular , the @xmath7-evolute of a discrete hypocycloid is a discrete hypocycloid of the same order , magnified and rotated in an explicitly described way ( theorem [ evoldhperp ] ) .    for generic hedgehogs , we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a pseudo - steiner point , a point shared by a polygon and its @xmath7-evolute and satisfying some natural assumptions .",
    "these necessary and sufficient conditions depend only on the directions of the sides of a polygon ( theorem [ thm : psst ] ) .",
    "then we prove some partially known , partially conjectured , and partially new facts in the cases of small @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , we prove b. grnbaum s conjecture that the third and the first @xmath7-evolutes of a pentagon are homothetic .",
    "after that , we pass to the main result of this section .",
    "it turns out that the spectrum of the @xmath23-matrix of the transformation of @xmath24-components is symmetric with respect to the origin , and that this symmetry respects the sizes of the jordan blocks of the matrix ( theorem [ symspectrum ] ) .",
    "consequently , all the eigenvalues of the square of the @xmath7-evolute transformation have even multiplicities , generically , multiplicity 2 .",
    "since the sides of the second @xmath7-evolute of a polygon @xmath5 are parallel to the sides of @xmath5 , this second iteration becomes a linear transformation in the @xmath9-dimensional space of @xmath9-gons with prescribed directions of sides .",
    "the dynamics of this transformation is determined by the maximal ( by absolute value ) eigenvalue @xmath25 .",
    "namely , if @xmath25 is real , then the iterated @xmath7-evolutes have two alternating limit shapes ( see figures [ positive ] and [ negative ] ) ; if @xmath25 is not real , then the limit behavior of the iterated @xmath7-evolutes is more complicated , but still interesting .",
    "section [ a - evo ] is devoted to @xmath12-evolutes .",
    "there are two natural ways to specify one of the @xmath26-evolutes .",
    "the first consists in choosing an @xmath12-evolute of @xmath5 using a coorientation of @xmath5 .",
    "we refer to the @xmath12-evolute constructed in this way as to the @xmath27-evolute .",
    "it is important that , at least generically , the @xmath27-evolute of a cooriented polygon has a canonical coorientation , which makes it possible to iterate the construction of the @xmath27-evolute .",
    "another possibility is to take for the sides of the evolute of a polygon @xmath5 the interior angle bisectors of @xmath5 ; the evolute constructed in this way is called the @xmath28-evolute .",
    "the main properties of @xmath27-evolutes are that the @xmath27-evolute of a discrete hypocycloid is again a discrete hypocycloid ( theorem [ evoldh ] ) , and the iterated @xmath27-evolutes of an arbitrary discrete hedgehog converge in the shape to a discrete hypocycloid ( theorem [ angleevolshapes ] ) . by the way , theorems [ evoldhperp ] and [ evoldh ] show that the limit behaviors of @xmath7- and @xmath27-evolutes are similar , although the scaling factors are different .",
    "we have no proven results on @xmath28-evolutes , but some , rather mysterious , experimental results concerning @xmath28-evolutes of pentagons may instigate future research .",
    "section [ ap - inv ] is devoted to @xmath12- and @xmath7-involutes .",
    "it is easy to see that all kinds of discrete involutes of a polygon @xmath8 have to do with the properties of the composition @xmath29 of the reflections of the plane in the consecutive sides of @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath7-involutes correspond to fixed points of @xmath29 , while @xmath12-involutes correspond to invariant lines of @xmath29 .",
    "this exhibits a big difference between the cases of even - gons and odd - gons : for an even - gon , @xmath29 is either a rotation , or a parallel translation , or the identity , while for an odd - gon , it is either a reflection or a glide reflection .",
    "thus , for a generic even - gon , the transformation @xmath29 has a unique fixed point , but no invariant lines .",
    "so , a generic even - gon has a unique @xmath7-involute ( which we call the _",
    "@xmath7-evolvent _ ) and no @xmath12-involutes . on the contrary",
    ", a generic odd - gon has a unique @xmath12-involute ( this is called an _ @xmath30-evolvent _ ) and no @xmath7-involutes .",
    "if , for an odd - gon @xmath8 , the transformation @xmath29 is a pure ( not glide ) reflection ( analytically this means that a certain quantity , called  quasiperimeter \" and similar to the signed length of a smooth hedgehog , vanishes ) , then , in addition to the @xmath30-evolvent , @xmath8 has a one - parameter family of @xmath12-involutes , and , generically , one of them has zero quasiperimeter ; this is the _",
    "@xmath31-evolvent_.    the existence of a @xmath7-involute for an odd - gon @xmath8 again requires the condition of vanishing quasiperimeter . under this condition , @xmath8 has a one - parameter family of @xmath7-involutes , and , for a generic @xmath8 , precisely one of them has zero quasiperimeter ; the corresponding @xmath7-involute is the _",
    "@xmath7-evolvent_.    all kinds of evolvent constructions admit iterations .",
    "we have some special results concerning equiangular hedgehogs .",
    "namely , the iterated @xmath12-evolvents of an equiangular hedgehog of zero perimeter converge to its pseudo - steiner point ( theorem [ ainvolequi ] ) .",
    "the iterated @xmath7-evolvents of an equiangular hedgehog with zero perimeter for odd - gons , and zero sum of lengths of , separately , odd - numbered and even - numbered sides for even - gons , converge in shape to two discrete hedgehogs ( theorem [ nodd_pinv_equi_limit ] ) . and the directions of the sides of iterated @xmath30-evolvents with @xmath9 odd behave ergodically ( theorem [ ergodic ] ) ( this generalizes the work of a number of authors on the dynamics of the map that sends a triangle to its pedal triangle ) .",

    "[ hedgehog ] a cooriented closed plane wave front without inflections and with total turning @xmath13 is called a _ hedgehog_.    hedgehogs are minkowski differences of convex curves , see @xcite .",

    "the total turning of @xmath1 is the same as that of @xmath0 .",
