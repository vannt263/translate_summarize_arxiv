    "after the seminal papers written by jackiw and rebbi  @xcite and su , schrieffer , and heeger  @xcite , quantum number fractionalization has become one of the most fundamental and fascinating concepts in condensed matter physics .",
    "for one dimensional spinless fermions , a domain wall soliton induces a localized mid - gap state which has a half of the electric charge .",
    "later this idea is further generalized by goldstone and wilczek .",
    "@xcite considering slow variations of the background mass fields in space and time , adiabatically induced currents are derived .",
    "the time component of the adiabatic current describes the charge density induced by the spatial variation of the mass soliton .",
    "the spatial integration of this charge density gives rise to the half electric charge .",
    "@xcite moreover , the temporal variation of the background mass fields generates the spatial component of the adiabatic current , which describes the adiabatic charge polarization or even the quantized charge pumping .",
    "@xcite therefore the existence of the topological soliton with nontrivial quantum numbers reflects the quantized dynamical response of the system .",
    "the discovery of the time - reversal invariant spin hall insulators  @xcite has triggered great attentions to the two dimensional topological band insulators ( tbis ) .",
    "tbis are the insulating phases that carry gapless edge states at the sample boundary due to the nontrivial bulk berry phase , which can either break  @xcite or preserve the time reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite because of the distinct bulk topological properties , @xmath1 flux defects in tbis carry nonzero spin or charge quantum numbers leading to jackiw - rebbi type topological solitons in two dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite in addition , in strongly interacting electron systems , it is proposed that tbis can be obtained from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotation symmetry .",
    "@xcite since this topological ",
    "mott \" insulator possesses a vector order parameter @xmath2 , skyrmion - type topological solitons are allowed , which are also expected to have nontrivial quantum numbers . for example , in the case of the spin hall ",
    "mott \" insulator , a skyrmion defect is a boson carrying a quantized electric charge 2@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we focus on a different class of topological mott insulators , the chiral magnetic insulators ( cmis ) , which can be obtained by considering electron - electron interactions in tbis . in cmis , the vector order parameter @xmath2",
    "is given by the stagggered spin ordering , which can acquire explicit time dependence by coupling to the external magnetic field . because of the quantized charge and spin hall effects , a skyrmion defect in cmis can carry charge and spin quantum numbers satisfying fermionic or bosonic statistics depending on the magnitude of the bulk topological invariants .",
    "considering smooth variations of the spin ordering directions in space and time , reminiscent of the approach pursued by goldstone and wilczek , we have shown that the quantized charge and spin pumpings are possible under the adiabatic change of the inhomogeneous spin structures such as the domain wall with rotating spins in collinear ferrimagnets or the conical ferrimagnetic phases in which the spatial modulation of the spin direction spreads over the whole system .    in cmis ,",
    "the quantum of the pumped charge / spin or the quantum number of a skyrmion strongly depends on the nature of the parent tbis . in the case of the cmis generated from the anomalous hall insulator ( ahi ) ,",
    "the quantum of the pumped charge / spin is solely determined by the spin / charge chern numbers of the collinear magnetic ground states .",
    "when the magnitude of the spin order parameter is small , the charge and spin chern numbers are the same as those of ahi . in this case",
    ", the spin can be pumped in the unit of @xmath3 while the charge pumping is forbidden , which , at the same time , means that the skyrmion is a chargeless spin-1 boson . as the magnitude of the ordered spin moment increases",
    ", a new cmi phase dubbed the topological chiral magnetic insulator ( tcmi ) emerges in noncentrosymmetric systems , which supports a fermionic skyrmion with charge @xmath0 and spin @xmath4 . here the quantized charge and spin pumpings can be achieved .    on the other hand , in the case of cmis derived from the spin hall insulator ( shi ) , the spin anisotropy inherent to shi due to the spin - orbit coupling imposes constraints on the adiabatic pumping and skyrmion quantum numbers .",
    "the polarizations strongly depend on the relative orientation of the spin anisotropy and the magnetic ordering directions .",
    "when the spin order parameter is parallel to the spin anisotropy direction , the charge polarization induced by the rotating spins in domain walls is always zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spin ordering is perpendicular to the spin anisotropy direction , finite charge polarization is expected for the neel domain walls and the transverse conical spin states . in the case of a skyrmion",
    ", it does not carry a charge quantum number independent of the magnitude of the spin order parameter . however , a meron defect can be charged but the net charge is not quantized .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the charge and spin polarizations in cmis can be understood in the framework of the adiabatic topological responses of generic inhomogeneous crystals .",
    "@xcite the inhomogeneity induced polarization current contains a topological part whose topological nature is endowed with the second chern number , which is quantized in four dimensional closed manifolds .",
    "when the inhomogeneity is introduced by the spatially varying three - component unit vector @xmath2 , the inhomogeneity induced topological current can be separated into the homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts , which allows the second chern number to be represented by the product of two independent topological invariants .",
    "one is the chern number that is quantized in the momentum space and the other is the skyrmion number defined in the position / time spaces .",
    "since electron correlation effects are required to achieve cmi in addition to large spin - orbit coupling , transition metal oxides with 5d electrons can be an ideal platform to realize cmi .",
    "recently , it is confirmed that the ground state of sr@xmath5iro@xmath6 is a spin - orbit entangled mott insulator with anti - ferromagnetic spin ordering ,  @xcite which manifests the strong interplay of electron correlation and spin - orbit coupling effects in ir - based compounds . in the case of",
    "na@xmath5iro@xmath7 which is expected to be shi in non - interacting limit , anti - ferromagnetic spin ordering develops when electron correlation effects are included on the parent shi phase .",
    "@xcite in this respect , na@xmath5iro@xmath7 is a candidate material in which the topological response of cmi can be observed .",
    "moreover , it is recently proposed that bilayers of the perovskite - type transition metal oxides grown along the [ 111 ] direction can be potential candidates for two - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "@xcite the transition metal ions in the bilayer are located on a honeycomb lattice consisting of two trigonal sublattices on different layers .",
    "interestingly , since the layer potential difference can be easily created by applying an electric field or by sandwiching the bilayer between two different substrates , lattice inversion symmetry can be explicitly broken in this system . therefore to reveal the ground state of the bilayer systems , it is important to understand the interplay of the spin - orbit coupling , electron correlation , and the broken inversion symmetry .",
