    "defects usually play a prominent role in various properties of a solid . for this reason , the physics and chemistry of defects have been the subjects of much study for several decades.@xcite many of these works focused mainly at the dilute limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , with a small defect concentration .",
    "this is the case of interest in doped semiconductors and/or compounds in the immediate vicinity of the stoichiometry . at certain conditions ( usually with high temperature ) deviation from the stoichiometry",
    "can span over a wide range of chemical composition .",
    "binary oxides ceo@xmath0 and uo@xmath0 represent the paradigms for such kind of non - stoichiometry in the fluorite - related structures , and many others exist as well.@xcite for a comprehensive understanding of these materials , knowledge from just near the stoichiometry is insufficient .",
    "this is because many physical quantities depend strongly on non - stoichiometry , and exhibit quite different behavior when at finite deviations . on the other hand , defects at high pressure",
    "have received little attention so far , and our knowledge about their general behavior at highly compressional conditions is very limited , in spite of the fact that they are crucial for earth modeling and for planetary evolution description , where plenty of defects presenting in variety of non - stoichiometric minerals in the interior of these celestial bodies .",
    "the capability to capture correctly the energetics and other physical properties across the whole stoichiometry range at different temperature - pressure conditions is an essential requirement for the purpose of predicting and controlling the behavior of these complex materials .",
    "nevertheless , a general theoretical method for this purpose is still elusive .",
    "even at ambient conditions and near the stoichiometry , our understanding about nuclear oxides such as uo@xmath0 and ( u , pu)o@xmath0 is also limited and unsatisfactory.@xcite although there are many papers and reports have been published on various aspects of diffusion in these oxides , a reasonable level of understanding has been reached only in the case of oxygen , from which the formation energy of oxygen frenkel pair can be deduced when the migration energy of the corresponding diffusion process is known.@xcite nevertheless , measuring oxygen diffusion in stoichiometric oxides is difficult because of the need to maintain the stoichiometry , which is almost impossible for a large temperature range.@xcite the difficulty also lies in the interpretation of available experimental data . while theoretical calculations can be applied to individual processes , transport and other data often correspond to a superposition of several entangled processes , and makes extraction of the desired information complicated.@xcite in addition to chemical diffusion and self - diffusion , electrical conductivity@xcite and neutron scattering@xcite have also been performed to measure the defect concentrations and formation energies . in all of these experiments , a poor understanding of the experimental conditions , as well as the inherent difficulties in the measurement and subsequent interpretation of data , have caused dispersed results.@xcite    there are also very few experimental data existed for cation defects in nuclear oxides.@xcite for example in uo@xmath0 , only crude estimates of the activation energy for uranium self - diffusion and migration energy of uranium vacancy are available . with the aid of point defect model ( pdm ) , one can extract the schottky defect formation energy from these estimates .",
    "but since a great uncertainty remains in the experimental data , the reliability of the derived value is doubtful.@xcite    progresses in density functional theory of electrons and in computational algorithms make it possible to calculate the relevant energetics directly from quantum mechanics .",
    "such kind of first principles methods have provided better data than previous semi - empirical interatomic potentials , and are comparable to experimental measurements .",
    "the electronic structures,@xcite structural phase transformations@xcite and equations of state ( eos),@xcite oxygen diffusion,@xcite and some defect clustering structures@xcite have been modeled .",
    "unfortunately , this advance never reached a satisfactory level for defect energetics , even though a lot of efforts have been devoted to it.@xcite it even can not reproduce the experimental fact that oxygen defects dominate the whole stoichiometry range.@xcite also one should note that including oxygen clusters can give rise to the expected predominance of oxygen defects,@xcite but its relevance to the experimentally measured defect formation energy is unclear.@xcite this discrepancy among experimental and theoretical results might be due to the limited accuracy of the theoretical assessments , for example the possible meta - stable electronic states that could be encountered in calculations of strongly correlated materials,@xcite the approximation employed to treat the partially localized 5__f _ _ orbitals,@xcite the variation of the charge state of defects,@xcite and the small size of the simulation cell for defective structure modeling that currently accessible , _ etc . _",
    "all of these might render uncertain error in the final results .",
    "but it also can arise from the error lying in the experimental estimates that widely used as the benchmark for theoretical modeling : the data are scattering and not fully self - consistent , and in some cases these estimated data can not reproduce the fact of the predominance of oxygen defects too.@xcite this makes the problem entangled and very hard to treat with .",
    "therefore any approach that can constrain the defect energetics and reduce its uncertainty is of decisive help for solving the problem .    in this report",
    ", we investigate the possibility of a such kind of method by examining the physics that governs the pressure - driven pseudo - transitions@xcite between different defect species . by establishing a theoretical relationship of the pseudo - phase boundary on defect formation energies ,",
    "we show that strict constraints can be imposed on these energy parameters , which might then be used to refine the experimental estimates . to achieve the final goal , however , one has first to measure the curve of pseudo - transition pressures , and obtain accurate equations of state of defects , then by making use of the theoretical method that we will present below , to get reliable estimate of defect formation energies . in this sense",
    "this report is the first step  but also the most important step  towards this accomplishment . by developing the theoretical basis of this constraining procedure , it not only provides us a new angle to understand the long - standing problem , but also establishes a general method in treating highly defective materials under high pressures . for the clarity of discussion",
    ", we will first present a simple theoretical framework using pdm that is intuitive and easy to understand , then a generalization to the general case will be made .    in sec.[sec : simple_model ] we discuss the pdm that allows us to calculate the pseudo - phase diagram of point defects , and then establish a relationship between pseudo - phase boundary and defect energetics . using this powerful tool ,",
    "the influence of intrinsic defect formation energy on pseudo - transition is then investigated in sec.[sec : pdm ] .",
    "the obtained information represents a constraint on the possible value of the formation energy of the defects .",
    "though our discussions are mainly focused on uranium dioxide in this paper , we also extend the investigation by considering virtual models to explore other interesting phenomena such as reentrant pseudo - transition and multi - defect coexistence in sec.[sec : virtual system ] .",
    "it is well known that pdm does not take defect - defect interactions into account and can be applied to only the vicinity of the stoichiometry . in order to deal with highly defective region and extrapolate the energetic and thermodynamic information obtained at finite stoichiometry deviations to the dilute limit , a general formalism that can treat defect interactions is developed in sec.[sec : defect interactions ] .",
    "this generalization is necessary for a realistic description of the nonlinear dependence of thermodynamic properties on non - stoichiometry . a brief discussion and remarks on charge state of defects , as well as other relevant issues ,",
    "are then given in sec.[sec : discussion ] , which is followed by a summary of the main conclusions .",
    "at dilute limit where defect concentration is negligibly small , imperfectness in crystal has little impact on thermodynamic and mechanical properties , despite a profound modification on electrical conductivity and/or magnetism might often occur . at large stoichiometry deviation ,",
    "the defect concentration is governed by the ratio of chemical compositions rather than by thermal excitation , therefore the density of defects could be enormous . in this case , noticeable influence on general thermodynamic quantities can be expected , so as on relevant mechanical properties .    to understand the general effects of non - stoichiometry on material s behavior , we require a physical model that expresses the defect density as a function of external conditions  usually the hydrostatic pressure and temperature , and how the presentation of defects modifies thermodynamic functions such as enthalpy or gibbs free energy .",
    "having such a function that incorporated defect effects , all relevant thermodynamic properties can be derived straightforwardly . in this section",
    "we first present the basic picture by considering the simple pdm .",
    "a general formalism will be developed in sec.[sec : defect interactions ] .    in pdm,@xcite the spatial size of an individual defect",
    "is assumed to be of zero dimension , and all interactions among them are neglected . in this simple model , defect concentrations",
    "are determined by the corresponding formation energy of isolated defects . considering a structure that contains one defect of type @xmath1",
    ", its gibbs free energy can be written as @xmath2 in which @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 stand for hydrostatic pressure , temperature , and volume of the simulation cell , respectively .",

    "variables with subscript 0 denote the corresponding value in the equilibrium condition of zero pressure , and @xmath7 is the bulk modulus .",

    "the debye temperature can be evaluated approximately by@xcite @xmath11^{1/2}.\\ ] ] here the superscript @xmath12 denotes the reference state ( here the defect - free uo@xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the effective volume per atom , and @xmath15 is the effective atomic weight .",
    "the parameters in these equations , namely @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , can be obtained by fitting to _ ab initio _ results of density functional theory , while @xmath19 can be taken from x - ray diffraction measurement.@xcite the details of determining the value of these parameters have been discussed and presented in ref ..",
    "having known @xmath20 , the formation gibbs free energy ( fge ) of intrinsic point defects can be constructed .",
    "for example , the fge of a frenkel pair ( fp ) of species @xmath21 is then expressed as @xmath22 and for the schottky defect ( s ) as ( taking uo@xmath0 as the example ) @xmath23 here @xmath24 denotes the number of atoms in a defect - free cell and @xmath25 is the corresponding gibbs free energy , @xmath26 is the gibbs free energy of the cell containing the respective defect . in a closed regime where no particle exchange with the exterior can occur ,",
    "the defect concentration must satisfy@xcite @xmath27[i_{o}]=\\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\delta g_{\\mathrm{o{\\_}fp}}}{k_{b } t}\\right)\\label{eq : pdm1},\\\\    & [ v_{u}][i_{u}]=\\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\delta g_{\\mathrm{u{\\_}fp}}}{k_{b } t}\\right)\\label{eq : pdm2},\\\\    & [ v_{o}]^{2}[v_{u}]=\\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\delta g_{\\mathrm{s}}}{k_{b } t}\\right)\\label{eq : pdm3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the composition equation that expressed in point defect populations is @xmath28-[i_{u}]\\right)+[i_{o}]-2[v_{o}]}{1-[v_{u}]+[i_{u } ] } , \\label{eq : pdmx}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the stoichiometry deviation ( for example that in uo@xmath30 ) .",
    "notice that eq.([eq : pdmx ] ) is different from the conventional definition of @xmath31-[i_{u}]\\right)+[i_{o}]-2[v_{o } ] ,    \\label{eq : pdm4}\\ ] ] which is valid only when no cation defect is involved .",
    "we thus complete the formalism of pdm , in which the defect concentrations are determined by solving eqs.([eq : pdm1]@xmath32[eq : pdmx ] ) .    since no interaction among defects has been taken into account in pdm , the total gibbs free energy of a defective system",
    "is a linear superposition of the contribution of each individual defect .",
    "that is , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gibbs free energy of the defect - free matrix .",
    "the defect concentration @xmath35 runs over @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 $ ] , and @xmath39 $ ] , respectively , with the superscript `` @xmath40 '' indicates the corresponding value in a defective reference system , and @xmath41 . from eq.([eq : gtot ] ) thermodynamic quantities as a function of stoichiometry deviation @xmath29 can be derived .",
    "in defective crystals , distinction of the physics mainly originates from the predominant defect species . thanks to the exponential dependence of defect concentrations on the formation energy , most regions in the phase space spanned by temperature , pressure , and chemical composition ( @xmath4-@xmath3-@xmath29 )",
    "are dominated by only one type of defect .",
    "one can then use the concept of pseudo phase to simplify the description of defective ( non - stoichiometric ) materials.@xcite in this picture , each pseudo phase corresponds to a region that is governed by a homogeneous distribution of a _ single _ type of defect . here",
    "no effects of migration and creation or annihilation of defects are considered , which is justified if we focus mainly on the _ long - time averaged _ properties only .",
    "with variation of the thermodynamic conditions of @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath29 , the predominant defect might change from one type into another , _",
    "i.e. _ , pseudo phase transition ( ppt ) might take place .",
    "physical quantities that affected by defects also change rapidly along this transition.@xcite from this perspective , the physics of defects can be greatly simplified to that of each individual pseudo - phases and their respective behavior at the ppt .",
    "it is thus important to understand the extent of the control region of each pseudo phase , namely , the pseudo phase diagram ( ppd ) . from eqs.([eq : pdm1]@xmath32[eq : pdmx ] ) , it is evident that such a diagram is completely described by the energetics of each defect .",
    "conversely , if we know the ppd , then constraints on defect formation energies can be established .",
    "it is natural to define the transition point of a ppt at where defect concentration increasing / decreasing to the half of its saturate value , then the corresponding pseudo - phase boundary ( for example in uo@xmath30 ) is determined by the following equation @xmath42 for a transition between @xmath43 and @xmath44 when @xmath45 , and @xmath46 between @xmath47 and @xmath48 when @xmath49 ( only point defects are considered ) . because all @xmath50 are functions of @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( and also depend on @xmath29 via defect interactions , which we discarded here but",
    "will discuss in detail below ) , solutions of eq.([eq : ppbxp ] ) and ( [ eq : ppbxn ] ) provide a set of constraints on formation energy of intrinsic defects .",
    "calculated with crocombette ( jpc)@xcite and gengs@xcite formation energies of defects .",
    "the constraints on intrinsic defect formation energies when the pseudo transition pressure bounded between 0 and 40gpa are also shown.,width=3 ]    this subsection is devoted to a realistic system of uo@xmath0 , where involved parameters are obtained by density functional theory calculations . since",
    "early experiments were driven by application of uo@xmath0 as a nuclear fuel , most investigations focused mainly on formation energy of intrinsic defects , which closely relates to the parameter @xmath16 in eq.([eq : colde ] ) . to be consistent with conventional notations , we use @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 to denote the formation energy of schottky defect , oxygen frenkel pair , and uranium frenkel pair at zero pressure and temperature , respectively . based on the defect energetics calculated by geng _",
    "et al . _ for uranium dioxide,@xcite the ppd on the @xmath3-@xmath29 plane",
    "are evaluated and shown in fig.[fig : ppd ] .",
    "it can be seen that in the region of @xmath49 an increasing of temperature from 300 to 2500k has little influence on the pseudo boundary .",
    "however , in the @xmath45 side , such a size of change in @xmath4 leads to an increase of the pseudo transition pressure about 5gpa . except that",
    ", the impact of @xmath29 on ppd at the pdm level of approximation is small , and with an opposite trend for the hypo- and hyper - stoichiometry region .",
    "there are a few other theoretical assessments of the defect energetics for uo@xmath0 available in literature.@xcite unfortunately in most cases only formation energy at 0gpa and 0k were given , from which , however , one can not determine the pseudo transition pressure because the information about the variation with temperature and pressure is lost . under an assumption that the compression behavior and phonon contribution are the same for all of these calculations , which is a simple but reasonable approximation , we can estimate the corresponding pseudo transition boundary by adjusting the @xmath16 in eq.([eq : colde ] ) accordingly to yield the respective formation energy at 0gpa and 0k using geng s equation of state.@xcite here we choose the data of j. p. crocombette ( jpc ) for the purpose of comparison , since it is a typical one that has considered possible charge states of defects , thus produced a formation energy of oxygen frenkel pair and schottky defect that seems in a good agreement with experimental estimates.@xcite by adjusting @xmath16 to reproduce the @xmath51 and @xmath52 of jpc , we obtained the estimated ppd of jpc s data .",
    "note here we have made an assumption that the charge state of each defect is fixed during compression or heating , and the formation energy of uranium interstitial was taken from geng s data because in jpc s work no value for this defect type was given .",
    "the ppd calculated with jpc s formation energy is drawn in fig.[fig : ppd ] for comparison . at @xmath49 side ,",
    "the transition from @xmath48 to @xmath47 takes place at a much higher pressure .",
    "this is reasonable since jpc s data has a lower formation energy for @xmath48 than geng s evaluation , which gives rise to a stronger stability of this defect . at the @xmath45 side ,",
    "uranium vacancy was predicted to be the predominant defect at low pressure , and the transition to @xmath44 occurs at about 8gpa .",
    "this result is consistent with previous pdm evaluations at zero hydrostatic pressure , where @xmath43 was predicted to be the major defect component .",
    "nevertheless , prevailing @xmath43 is contradictory to the experimental observation that oxygen defect should dominate this region , indicating that the experimental estimate of the defect formation energy might be inconsistent in itself.@xcite this difficulty could stem from the procedure of extraction defect energetics from diffusion measurements . usually the employed physical models were very simple and might lead to inaccurate explanation of the measured data.@xcite    on the other hand , as mentioned above , ppd provides valuable information about possible range of the defect formation energy . for uo@xmath0 , the ppt in fluorite structure ( if exists ) should be bounded between a pressure range of 0 and 40gpa ,",
    "because at higher pressures uo@xmath0 transforms into @xmath54 phase,@xcite which is followed by an iso - structural transition,@xcite and finally converges to isotropic @xmath55 structure@xcite according to recent theoretical predictions . under this restriction",
    ", the formation energy of intrinsic defects should satisfy @xmath56 when @xmath49 , and @xmath57 when @xmath45 for a ppt to occur between a pressure of 0 and 40gpa .",
    "these constraints are marked in fig.[fig : ppd ] together with dashed lines that indicate the corresponding bounded range of pressure .    .",
    ", width=3 ]    theoretical assessment explicitly suggests that @xmath43 definitely becomes unfavorable under compressional conditions .",
    "therefore the experimental observation that @xmath44 prevails at @xmath45 region implies that there should be no ppt from @xmath43 to @xmath44 at any pressures greater than zero",
    ". then from eq.([eq : ppd2 ] ) one gets @xmath58 which puts a strong constraint on possible value of defect formation energies . for example",
    "the experimental estimates of @xmath52 lie in between @xmath59ev and @xmath51 between @xmath60ev.@xcite if we take @xmath51 as 7.0ev , then @xmath52 must be less than 3.5ev .",
    "this value is , however , incompatible with the most reliable experimental assessments.@xcite on the other hand , if we take the neutron scattering measurement@xcite of 4.6ev as a reliable estimate for @xmath52 , then @xmath51 must be greater than 9.3ev .",
    "this in turn disqualifies most theoretical estimates with charged defects.@xcite in a word , all of these indicate that we need further scrutiny on these estimates , and any alternative and/or complemental information on defect energetics are decisive to reach the final conclusion",
    ". inequalities of eqs.([eq : ppd1]@xmath32[eq : ppd2 ] ) cover most range of the experimental estimates , as shown in fig.[fig : tp ] .",
    "thus it can provide new understanding about this issue if we can measure the compression - driven ppt of point defects experimentally .",
    "defective behavior of materials at high pressure is determined by the variation of defect formation enthalpy with compression .",
    "it is also affected by possible structural transitions of the matrix .",
    "above discussion elaborated what might happen in a compressed non - stoichiometric uo@xmath0 .",
    "in other materials , however , much more complex phenomena can be expected . from a theoretical perspective , it is helpful to explore all possibilities in order to grasp the general feature of the physics of defects . in the simple pdm approximation , the physics",
    "is mainly determined by the parameters appeared in eq.([eq : colde ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the value of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 of each defective configurations that were employed to derive the formation gibbs free energy ( fge ) .",
    "therefore we can arbitrarily alter these parameters to probe other interesting behaviors of defects that are allowed in theory but not in the realistic uo@xmath0 .",
    "the first phenomenon we would like to discuss about is reentrant transition .",
    "it is a rare type of phase change even for a conventional physical state , where one phase that has been transformed into another re - appears . on the phase diagram",
    "the corresponding phase boundary is a reentrant curve .",
    "analogous phenomenon can also take place in ppt , where the predominant defect species firstly changes into another type , and then transforms back .",
    "the condition of this transition is completely governed by eqs.([eq : pdm1]@xmath32[eq : pdm3 ] ) .",
    "put it explicitly , if the derived equation [ eq.([eq : ppbxp ] ) or ( [ eq : ppbxn ] ) ] has multiple solutions , then the corresponding ppt is reentrant .    .",

    "another term of @xmath62 is also shown as a dashed line in the figure .",
    "the points of intersection a and b correspond to the solutions of eq.([eq : ppbxp ] ) , which also are the locations where ppt taking place .",
    "in the lower panel , the change of defect concentrations along compression is illustrated , from which one can clearly see that cation vacancy re - appears at higher pressures .",
    "it is necessary to point out that this result was obtained by subtracting 145gpa from the bulk modulus of all defective uo@xmath0 configurations , thus might be an artifact .",
    "nevertheless , such a virtual model can help us acquire a profound understanding of material s behavior that having reentrant ppt , if it exists .",
    "the resultant modifications on eos and thermodynamic properties across this transition region are interesting .",
    "figure [ fig : pv_ppt ] illustrates the compression behavior of the same ppt as in fig.[fig : reentry ] , in which the restoring of the compression curve at high pressure end is evident .",
    "there are two volume - collapses in the reentrant ppt at point a and b , respectively . between a and b , the curve is steeper .",
    "this is consistent with the requirement for a pressure - driven reentrant transition to occur , namely , the intermediate phase should have a larger bulk modulus and a smaller equilibrium volume .",
    "this condition guarantees a double volume - collapse along compression , which is a necessity for a first - order reentrant transition .",
    "other thermodynamic properties also show discontinuous or quasi - discontinuous jump at the ppt points .",
    "the inset in fig.[fig : pv_ppt ] draws relative variation of thermal expansivity @xmath63 with respect to its initial value along the 300k compression curve .",
    "it deviates from the trend of the initial phase ( as the dashed line shows ) at point a and plunge to a new value , but at point b it jumps back to the previous curve , a key feature of reentrant transition .",
    "other physical quantities , such as specific heat and compressibility , demonstrate similar characteristics .    .",
    "inset : the relative variation of thermal expansivity .",
    ", width=3 ]      the picture of pseudo - phase of defects is only valid when the dominating region of the associated defect type is well defined .",
    "for point defects at low temperature , it is usually the case .",
    "however , with elevated temperature and/or when complex defect clustering is involved , competition might lead to coexistence of different defect species , where the notation of pseudo phase could lose its physical importance .    for realistic uo@xmath0 , pseudo - phase",
    "can always be defined , whether oxygen clusters ( _ e.g. _ , cot - o cluster ) involved or not . at high temperatures ,",
    "the zone of pseudo phase boundary becomes wide , and renders the ppt as a smooth crossover.@xcite in spite of this , the material behavior still can be understood within the framework of pseudo phase . in some conditions , however , a situation that one defect species appears but never gains the dominant role might be possible .",
    "this will completely invalidate the picture of pseudo phase , and a detailed analysis of defect concentrations becomes necessary ( in contrast to this , the defect concentrations are determined by stoichiometry deviation if pseudo phase can be applied ) .    , see text for details . , width=3 ]    an example of this is presented in fig.[fig : coext ] , which was generated with jpc s formation energy data.@xcite in addition to that , the value of cot - o cluster@xcite was also reduced by 4.865ev , namely , we have artificially decreased the stability of oxygen clusters .",
    "the result is that oxygen interstitial o@xmath64 gets some promotion , but not enough to become the major one , and persists only within a narrow pressure range .",
    "it is evident from fig.[fig : coext ] that in this virtual system u@xmath64 and cot - o ( at least for most pressure range ) can be depicted using pseudo phase , and there is a ppt from u@xmath64 to cot - o at a pressure of 7gpa . on the other hand , o@xmath64 , which appears from 20 to 50gpa , depletes the concentration of cot - o slightly .",
    "but it never gains the dominance , and the phenomenon must be taken as a defect coexistence rather than being a ppt . to understand the difference between these is crucial for a correct description of defective materials using the concept of pseudo phase .",
    "above discussion is based on the approximation of pdm , which is valid at the dilute limit . with an increase of defect concentrations",
    ", however , interaction between defects becomes significant .",
    "this could lead to a severe deviation from the prediction of pdm . on the other hand ,",
    "non - stoichiometry might affect the eos and energetics of defects , thus modify the ppd . to obtain the correct defect behavior near the stoichiometry ,",
    "a close cooperation between experimental measurements and theoretical analysis is necessary . for that purpose ,",
    "a thorough and comprehensive understanding of defect interaction is crucial .",
    "this is because with such an accurate information , we can deduce the formation energy at dilute limit from the measured ppd at finite stoichiometry deviations .",
    "it is worthy of mentioning that the same extraction procedure can be done using the simple pdm , but the resultant error is usually quite large . in this part of the paper",
    ", we will first derive a general formalism that includes defect interactions , then we will show that the conventional pdm can be adapted to take these interactions into account effectively with a simple constant mean - field approximation , which greatly expands the applicability of pdm .",
    "if one is interested mainly in macroscopic properties of a defective material that averaged over a long enough time scale , the most important contribution comes from defects in static distributions . for a classical crystal at finite temperature ,",
    "defects have nonzero probability of migrating between available sites .",
    "this alters the dynamics and transport property of the system .",
    "nevertheless , diffusion does not modify the overall macroscopic properties very much as long as the distribution of defects is still in an equilibrium state .",
    "this is because migration is a transient process and in most time defects are trapped in their equilibrium sites . in a migration process , defects induce dynamic deformations in the local lattice , and scatter with phonon .",
    "this effect might drive phonon away from its equilibrium distribution .",
    "however , considering that this change is very small compared to thermal fluctuations , and our interested time scale is many orders longer than the relaxation time of phonon , it is justified to ignore this effect .",
    "the main assumptions in the theory include : ( a ) we work on a lattice model , ( b ) only static distribution of defects is considered , ( c ) the distribution must be homogeneous , ( d ) dynamic effects due to defect migration are ignored , ( e ) no defect creation and annihilation are considered , ( f ) when defect clusters are involved , taking them as single objects , namely , ignore association and/or dissociation effects .    with these assumptions ,",

    "the free energy of the @xmath72-th configuration , @xmath84 , which consists of the cold crystal energy at 0k and phonon contributions to the internal energy and entropy ( as well as a term of @xmath85 , if at finite pressure ) , can be calculated with modern first - principles methods . since defects in an individual configuration manifest as",
    "an imperfect occupation of the lattice sites , the equilibrium thermodynamics of defects is therefore completely described by eq.([eq : rho ] ) , in which the contribution of defect interactions arises from @xmath84 .",
    "when the energy scale of temperature is much smaller than the formation energy of defects , which usually is the case for most applications , the partition function is dominated by the perfect occupation ( _ i.e. _ , the ground - state ) , namely @xmath86 , where the subscript 0 denotes the groundstate . in this situation",
    "eq.([eq : rho ] ) reduces to @xmath87 where the fge of configuration @xmath72 is given by @xmath88 .",

    "furthermore , equations similar to pdm [ eqs.([eq : pdm1]@xmath32[eq : pdm3 ] ) ] also can be constructed easily using eq.([eq : rhoq ] ) , indicating that the simple formalism of pdm is much more flexible than what it was originally proposed .",
    "it is necessary to point out that for a system defined on a lattice , there is an orthogonal and complete basis set called correlation functions , which are an alternative but powerful representation of all possible occupation configurations of particles on the lattice using increasingly complex point sets that ranging from single point to nearest pairs and bigger clusters.@xcite any functions defined on the lattice can be expanded with such a basis . for defective crystals ,",
    "the matrix and interstitial sites define such a lattice naturally .",
    "if we further introduce a special species of _ white atom _ , and regard all vacancies as that occupied by white atoms , then such orthogonal and complete correlation functions @xmath90 can be defined . in this way",

    "this is because for a configuration containing @xmath95 non - interacting point defects , the corresponding fge is just @xmath95 times of that of a single one , and then eq.([eq : rhoq ] ) gives rise to @xmath96 , which is exactly the result of pdm . alternatively , for non - interacting defects , the presence of a defect has no influence on others , we therefore can isolate a defect by cutting it and the associated local lattice out from the matrix , and then extend the surrounding lattice to an infinite range .",
    "this operation keeps the defective behavior .",
    "it maps non - interacting defects with finite concentrations onto a group of systems at the dilute limit , which justifies the application of pdm .    when interactions between defects are substantial , it is almost impossible to isolate a defect from others . at a condition that the distribution of defects is homogeneous , however , we can approximate the interaction by a constant mean - field . in this approximation ,",
    "the defects and the associated local lattice environment that are cut out from the matrix keep the original size , and subject to a field that takes a role of modeling the interactions with other homogeneously distributed defects that have been removed . to construct accurately an environmental field of such kind is difficult , if not impossible . for practical purpose",
    ", we may simplify it by using regularly distributed defects to simulate the field approximately .",
    "this sacrifices the rigidity of the theory , but makes the problem more tractable .",
    "what one needs to do now is to periodically repeat the piece of defective lattice that has been cut out from the matrix along the three dimensional lattice vectors . in this way",
    "the periodical images of the defect take the role of modeling the homogeneous environment produced by other defects .",
    "just one such configuration of course can not capture the whole features of the defect interactions . by averaging over all possible regular defective distributions ,",
    "nevertheless , one eventually can reach a converged result .",
    "generally the free energy of a system in the ensemble can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath35 is the concentration of defect @xmath1 in this system .",
    "if only up to linear terms are kept , then eqs.([eq : gibbs1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rhoq ] ) reduce back to the conventional pdm .",

    "furthermore , since the @xmath50 in eq.([eq : rhoq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath101 where the first term at the right hand side represents the contribution of non - interacting defects , and the second term arises from defect interactions , eq.([eq : rhoq ] ) then leads to @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the probability predicted by conventional pdm which gives a defect concentration of @xmath104 ( determined by @xmath105 ) . for example",

    "this implies that only the diagonal terms in eq.([eq : gibbs2 ] ) make sense .",
    "namely , only interactions between the same kind of defect need to be considered , which greatly reduces the number of _ ab initio _ calculations that are required for extraction of the interaction strengths @xmath7 and @xmath100 . using configurations with different simulation cell size of @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 of the cubic fluorite unit",

    "instead , the problem changes to `` how the effectively independent defects distribute on the lattice '' . for a purpose of investigating the compression behavior of defects ,",
    "it is helpful to employ a reference supercell , and normalize all involved energetics with respect to it . in doing so",
    ", however , the number of defects might no longer be an integer .",
    "a re - scaling procedure is thus required when evaluating the formation energy of a _ single _ defect .",
    "let @xmath125 be the defect contribution in eq.([eq : gibbs2 ] ) that is evaluated in the reference cell , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath126 , with a defect concentration equals @xmath127 . the number of unit cells in a supercell which contains _ one _ and _ only one _ of this type of defect is @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the number of available sites for this defect in a unit cell .",
    "then the energy difference for creating a defect is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the number of unit cells making up the reference supercell . in this way , the formation energy of a frenkel pair for @xmath132 species becomes @xmath133 and the schottky defect formation energy is @xmath134 here @xmath24 is the total number of atoms in a defect - free reference cell . for a @xmath121 supercell of fluorite uo@xmath0 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 . also for a cubic fluorite unit",

    "the obtained results are summarized in table [ tab : ef ] .",
    "we can see that a @xmath121 cell is not big enough to converge the formation energy to the dilute limit .",
    "the deviation from the extrapolated value is less than 1ev .",

    "figure [ fig : alpha ] shows the relative variation of thermal expansivity @xmath63 and compressibility @xmath139 as a function of stoichiometry deviation @xmath29 at 300k and 0gpa , in which the solid points denote the exact value of the configurations that were employed to extract the interaction strength .",
    "it is evident that the linear approximation of eq.([eq : gibbs2 ] ) ( namely the conventional pdm ) fails to reveal the fine behavior of non - stoichiometric uo@xmath0 .",
    "far from the point that was used to approximate the defect formation energy , it deviates from the exact value drastically . on the other hand , both quadratic and cubic approximations predict a curved variation of physical quantities correctly .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sharp tip appearing at the stoichiometry is very similar to the `` w '' shape anomaly in alloys.@xcite nevertheless , the underlying physics is different .",
    "here it mainly originates from two facts : ( a ) the curvature due to defect interactions , and ( b ) the predominant defect type at the hyper- and hypo - stoichiometry sides are different , which gives rise to different variation trends of the physical quantities .",
    "from this perspective , measuring the departure of relevant physical quantities from a linear behavior near the stoichiometry would reveal the strength of defect interactions , and constrain the application range of the conventional pdm .    above discussions revealed the power of including defect interaction into statistical mechanics model such as pdm .",
    "though by comparison with available experimental data one can assess the validity of our approach , due to the uncertainty of these data as mentioned in sec.[sec : intr ] and [ sec : pdm ] , a quantitative validation has to be made with direct _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "to this end , we made an independent calculation on a defective configuration of @xmath141 , using a supercell of @xmath142 of the cubic fluorite unit , in which one oxygen atom has been removed to create one oxygen vacancy .",
    "the obtained energetics are listed in table [ tab : cohee ] , and the calculated thermal expansivity and compressibility are compared with that of effective pdm in fig.[fig : alpha ] as the open square points .",
    "note that in this separate calculation we employed only the experimental observation that oxygen vacancy prevails in uo@xmath143 , and did not invoke any other approximations .",
    "therefore the good agreement between these two results as shown in fig.[fig : alpha ] provides a solid verification of the validity of our constant mean - field treatment of defect interactions for homogeneously distributed defects , as well as the effective pdm that based on it .",
    "uo@xmath0 is a semiconductor with a finite energy gap , it is possible that defects in it are charged rather than being neutral . except very few studies,@xcite most _ ab initio _",
    "investigations on defective uo@xmath0 assumed a neutral simulation cell , as we did here . in principle",
    ", such `` neutral '' calculations do not correspond to literally neutral defects , since local transfer of electrons might lead to a partial charge of the defects .",
    "nevertheless , finite size of the simulation cell imposes a constraint on the charge redistribution , and thus defect might not reach its full charge state .",
    "this problem becomes very severe when at the dilute limit or near the stoichiometry , where defects can be fully charged only by exchanging electrons with valence / conduction bands , which is a kind of global charge redistribution . for large stoichiometry deviation , however , defects interact with the matrix strongly , leading to deep defect levels which are either at near the gap middle or hybridization with valence / conduction bands . in both cases a neutral defect could be expected because it is difficult to _ ionize _ the defect at low temperatures in the first case and no charged defect can be supported in the second one .    for oxygen clusters ,",
    "crocombette argued that charged state makes them unfavorable at the stoichiometry.@xcite it is reasonable .",
    "actually , `` neutral '' calculations also indicated that oxygen clusters have negligible concentrations when near the stoichiometry.@xcite putting these information together , we ascertain that it should have no defect clustering when @xmath144 . but this does not mean that oxygen clustering is negligible at non - stoichiometry .",
    "the experimental evidence for such clustering was in fact observed at large values of @xmath29,@xcite which is compatible with recent neutral calculations that predicted prevailing cot - o clusters at hyper - stoichiometry region . on the other hand , _ ab initio _ electronic structure revealed that the defect levels of cot - o cluster hybridize strongly with the valence band of the matrix,@xcite which implies that the cluster might be `` neutral '' , or at least these `` neutral '' results should partially reflect some physical reality . in these considerations ,",
    "crocombette s conclusion about charged oxygen defects@xcite might lose the relevance when far from the stoichiometry .",
    "but overall the charged state of defects in uo@xmath0 is still an open issue .    in the derivation of the general formalism of defects in sec.[sec : defect interactions ] , we did not consider the charged state . to include",
    "this is straightforward .",
    "one just needs to add an additional index to each type of defect to mark its charge state , and include the chemical potential of free electrons to take the charge contribution at the fermi level into account .",

    "the volume collapse due to ppt from u@xmath137 to o@xmath64 ( here we ignored oxygen clustering ) is evident and therefore detectable . on the other hand , this pseudo transition pressure depends sensitively on the formation energy of @xmath44 : it spans over a wide range of 40gpa when there is a change in @xmath149 about 4.0ev .",

    "this is because for a classical crystal , the change of defect species can proceed via only atomic diffusion , which is a very slow process , and thus no defect can respond to rapid thermal fluctuations .",

    "secondly , the compressibility would diverge at zero temperature .",
    "considering the relationship between sound velocity and the compressibility , this implies a vanishing sound velocity ( and the bulk modulus ) in the vicinity of a ppt at low temperatures if defects have instantaneous response . on the phonon spectrum , it would manifest as an abnormal softening in acoustic branches at long - wave length ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath152 point in the reciprocal space ) .",
    "this observation is tantalizing . but",
    "can it be true ?",
    "we can not answer it yet .",

    ". if the wavefunctions of all defects are in a coherent state , then an instantaneous and simultaneous change of the defect species might be possible.@xcite in this mechanism the requirement for a large scale atomic diffusion has been removed , and a single change in defecton state is enough for a quantum pseudo transition to occur .",
    "nevertheless , much more theoretical works are necessary in order to pin down this possibility definitely .",
    "a general formalism for the thermodynamics of defects in a crystal was derived based on the statistics of a grand canonical ensemble on a lattice . by introducing idle white atoms for vacancy and extending the sublattice of interstitial sites ,",

    "<S> making use of the energetics and equations of state of defective uranium dioxide that calculated with first - principles method , we demonstrate a possibility of constraining the formation energy of point defects by measuring the transition pressures of the corresponding pseudo - phase of defects . the mechanically stable range of fluorite structure of uo@xmath0 , which dictates the maximum possible pressure of relevant pseudo - phase transitions , gives rise to defect formation energies that span a wide band and overlap with the existing experimental estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal that the knowledge about pseudo - phase boundaries can not only provide important information of energetics that is helpful for reducing the scattering in current estimates , but also be valuable for guiding theoretical assessments , even to validate or disprove a theory . in order to take defect interactions into account and to extrapolate the physical quantities at finite stoichiometry deviations to that near the stoichiometry </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a general formalism to describe the thermodynamics of a defective system . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that it is possible to include interactions among defects in a simple expression of point defect model ( pdm ) by introducing an auxiliary constant mean - field . </S>",
    "<S> this generalization of the simple pdm leads to great versatility that allows one to study nonlinear effects of stoichiometry deviation on materials behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it is a powerful tool to extract the defect energetics from finite defect concentrations to the dilute limit . besides these , the full content of the theoretical formalism and some relevant and interesting issues , including reentrant pseudo - transition , multi - defect coexistence , charged defects , and possible consequence of instantaneous defective response in a quantum crystal , are explored and discussed . </S>"
