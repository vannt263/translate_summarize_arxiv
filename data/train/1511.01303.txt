    "* motivation . * in the traditional literature of arrovian social choice @xcite , especially voting theory , the preferences of an agent are often represented by ordinal information only : a strict total order over the available options , or sometimes a binary relation of preference that may not be a strict total order ( for example if indifference is allowed ) .",
    "however , it can be interesting for voting systems to consider cardinal preferences , for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , some voting systems are not based on ordinal information only , like approval voting or range voting .",
    "secondly , voters can be in a situation of uncertainty , either because the rule of the voting system involves a part of randomness , or because each voter has incomplete information about other voters preferences and the ballots they will choose . to express preferences in a situation of uncertainty , a classical and elegant model is the one of expected utilities @xcite .",
    "the utility vector @xmath0 representing the preferences of an agent is an element of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of available options or _ candidates _ ; the utility of a lottery over the options is computed as an expected value .    for a broad set of applications in economics ,",
    "the options under consideration are financial rewards or quantities of one or several economic goods , which leads to an important consequence : there is a natural structure over the space of options .",
    "for example , if options are financial rewards , there is a natural order over the possible amounts and it is defined prior to the agents preferences .",
    "we consider here the opposite scenario where options are symmetrical _ a priori_. this symmetry condition is especially relevant in voting theory , by a normative principle of neutrality , but it can apply to other contexts of choice under uncertainty when there is no natural preexistent structure on the space of available options .",
    "the motivation for this paper came from the possible generalizations of the _ impartial culture _ to agents with expected utilities .",
    "the impartial culture is a classical probabilistic model in voting theory where each agent draws independently her strict total order of preference with a uniform probability over the set of possible orders .",
    "the difficulty is not to define a probability law over utilities such that its projection on ordinal information is the impartial culture .",
    "indeed , it is sufficient to define a distribution where voters are independent and all candidates are treated symmetrically .",
    "the issue is to choose one in particular : an infinity of distributions meet these conditions and we can wonder whether one of these generalizations has canonical reasons to be chosen rather than the others .    to answer this question , we need to address an important technical point .",
    "as we will see , an agent s utility vector is defined up to two constants , and choosing a specific normalization is arbitrary . as a consequence , the utility space is a quotient space of @xmath1 , and _ a priori _ , there is no canonical way to push a metric from @xmath1 to this quotient space .",
    "hence , at first sight , it seems that there is no natural definition of a uniform distribution of probability over that space .",
    "more generally , searching a natural generalization of the impartial culture to the utility space naturally leads to investigate different topics about the geometry of this quotient space and to get a better understanding of its properties related to algebra , topology and measure theory .",
    "we emphasize that our goal is not to propose a measure that represents real - life preferences",
    ". such approach would follow from observation and experimental studies rather than theoretical work .",
    "instead , we aim at identifying a measure that can play the role of a neutral , reference , measure . this will give a model for uniformness to which real distributions of utilities can be compared .",
    "for example , if an observed distribution has higher density than the reference measure in certain regions of the utility space , this could be interpreted as a non - uniform culture for the population under study and give an indication of an overall trend for these regions . with this aim in mind",
    ", we will assume a symmetry hypothesis over the different candidates .",
    "* contributions and plan . *",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : modele_vnm ] , we quickly present von neumann  morgenstern framework and define the utility space . in section  [ sec : dualite ] , we show that the utility space may be seen as a quotient of the dual of the space of pairs of lotteries over the candidates . in section  [ sec : operateurs ] , we naturally define an inversion operation , that corresponds to reversing preferences while keeping their intensities , and a summation operation , that is characterized by the fact that it preserves unanimous preferences .",
    "since the utility space is a manifold , it is a natural wish to endow it with a riemannian metric . in section  [ sec : riemann ] , we prove that the only riemannian representation that preserves the natural projective properties and the _ a priori _ symmetry between the candidates is the round metric",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : pratique ] , we use this result to give a canonical generalization of the impartial culture and to suggest the use of von mises  fisher model to represent polarized cultures .",
    "in this section , we define some notations and we quickly recall von neumann  morgenstern framework in order to define the utility space .    let @xmath3 .",
    "we will consider @xmath2 mutually exclusive options called _ candidates _ , each one represented by an index in @xmath4 .",
    "lottery _ over the candidates is an @xmath2-tuple @xmath5 such that ( s.t . ) @xmath6 .",
    "the set of lotteries is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "the preferences of an agent over lotteries are represented by a binary relation @xmath8 over @xmath7 .",
    "von neumann ",
    "morgenstern theorem states that , provided that relation @xmath8 meets quite natural assumptions is complete , transitive , archimedean and independent of irrelevant alternatives .",
    "] , it can be represented by a utility vector @xmath9 , in the sense that following the relation @xmath8 is equivalent to maximizing the expected utility .",
    "formally , for any two lotteries @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12    mathematical definitions , assumptions and proof of this theorem can be found in @xcite , and discussions about the experimental validity of the assumptions are available in @xcite .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "a crucial point is that @xmath0 is defined up to an additive constant and a positive multiplicative constant .",
    "formally , for any two vectors @xmath0 and @xmath13 , let us note @xmath14 iff @xmath15 s.t .",

    "since @xmath130 is a topological sphere , this constant curvature must be positive .",
    "up to multiplying @xmath148 by a constant , we can assume that this constant curvature is @xmath159 .",
    "as a consequence , there is an isometry @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the unit sphere of @xmath162 , endowed with its usual round metric .",
    "the function @xmath163 obviously maps geodesic to geodesics , let us deduce the following .",
    "there is a linear map @xmath164 inducing @xmath163 , that is such that : @xmath165 where @xmath166 denotes both projections @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "first , @xmath163 maps any pair of antipodal points of @xmath161 to a pair of antipodal points of @xmath169 : indeed in both cases antipodal pairs are characterized by the fact that there are more than one geodesic containing them .",
    "it follows that @xmath163 induces a map @xmath170 from the projective space @xmath171 ( which is the set of lines through the origin in @xmath172 , identified with the set of pairs of antipodal points of @xmath161 ) to the projective space @xmath173 ( which is the set of lines through the origin in @xmath60 , identified with the set of pairs of antipodal points of @xmath169 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath163 sends geodesics of @xmath161 to geodesics of @xmath169 and condition [ enumi : geodesics ] together imply that @xmath170 sends projective lines to projective lines .",
    "as is well known , a one - to - one map @xmath174 which sends lines to lines must be an affine map ; a similar result holds in projective geometry , concluding that @xmath170 must be a projective map .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for both results .    that @xmath170 is projective exactly means that there is a linear map @xmath164 inducing @xmath170 , which then induces @xmath175 .    using @xmath176 to push the canonical inner product of @xmath162",
    ", we get that there exists an inner product @xmath177 on @xmath60 that induces @xmath148 , in the sense that @xmath148 is the riemannian metric obtained by identifying @xmath130 with the unit sphere defined in @xmath60 by @xmath178 and restricting @xmath178 to it .    the last thing to prove",
    "is that @xmath178 is the inner product coming from the canonical one on @xmath1 .",
    "note that hypothesis [ enumi : permutations ] is mandatory , since any inner product on @xmath60 does induce on @xmath130 a riemannian metric satisfying [ enumi : geodesics ] .",
    "each canonical basis vector @xmath179 defines a point in @xmath130 and a half - line @xmath180 in @xmath60 .",
    "condition [ enumi : permutations ] ensures that these half - lines are permuted by some isometries of @xmath181 .",
    "in particular , there are vectors @xmath182 that have constant pairwise distance ( for @xmath178 ) .",
    "the family @xmath183 is , up to multiplication by a scalar , the unique basis of @xmath60 such that @xmath182 and @xmath184 .",
    "first , by definition of the @xmath185 , these vectors form a regular simplex and @xmath186 .",
    "it follows that @xmath183 has the required property and we have left to show uniqueness .",
    "assume @xmath187 is a basis of @xmath60 such that @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "then there are positive scalars @xmath190 such that @xmath191 for all @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "then @xmath194 , and since the @xmath195 form a basis , it must hold @xmath196 for all @xmath197 .",
    "now consider the canonical inner product @xmath198 on @xmath60 that comes from the canonical one on @xmath1 .",
    "since permutations of coordinates are isometries , we get that the vectors @xmath199 ( where @xmath166 is now the orthogonal projection from @xmath200 to @xmath54 ) form a regular simplex for @xmath198 , so that @xmath201 .",
    "it follows that @xmath202 for some @xmath203 and all @xmath197 .",
    "we deduce that the @xmath185 form a regular simplex for both @xmath178 and @xmath198 , which must therefore be multiple from each other .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem  [ thm_sphere ] .    however , the implication [ enumi : hypotheses_spheres ] @xmath75 [ enumi : sphere ] in the theorem is not true for @xmath42 . for each non - indifferent utility vector ,",
    "let us consider its representative verifying @xmath204 and @xmath37 . this way ,",
    "@xmath130 is identified to edges of the unit cube in @xmath32 , as in figure  [ fig : cubic ] .",
    "we use this identification to endow @xmath130 with the metric induced on these edges by the canonical inner product on @xmath32",
    ". then conditions [ enumi : geodesics ] and [ enumi : permutations ] of the theorem are met , but not condition [ enumi : sphere ] .",
    "another remark is of paramount importance about this theorem .",
    "since we have a canonical representative @xmath0 for each equivalence class @xmath31 as a unit vector of @xmath60 , we could be tempted to use it to compare utilities between several agents .",
    "we stress on the fact that this representation can not be used for interpersonal comparison of utility levels or utility differences .    for example , for two agents , consider the following representatives : @xmath205    the fact that @xmath206 does not mean that an agent with preferences @xmath84 dislikes candidate  3 more than an agent with preferences @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , when changing from candidate 1 to candidate 2 , the gain for agent @xmath31 ( @xmath207 ) can not be compared to the loss for agent @xmath84 ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm_sphere ] conveys no message for interpersonal comparison of utilities .",
    "indeed , utilities belonging to two agents are essentially incomparable in the absence of additional assumptions @xcite . taking canonical representatives on the @xmath135-dimensional sphere",
    "is only used to compute distances between two points in the utility space .",
    "once the space is endowed with a metric , it is endowed with a natural probability measure : the uniform measure in the sense of this metric ( this is possible because the space has a finite total measure ) .",
    "we will denote @xmath209 this measure , which is thus the normalized riemannian volume defined by the metric @xmath133 .    in practice , to draw vectors according to a uniform probability law over @xmath130 , it is sufficient to use a uniform law on the unit sphere in  @xmath54 . in other words , once one identifies @xmath130 with the unit sphere in @xmath60 , then @xmath209 is exactly the usual uniform measure .    in the present case ,",
    "the fact that the round sphere has many symmetries implies additional nice qualities for @xmath209 , which we sum up in a proposition .",
    "let @xmath210 be any probability measure on @xmath169 .    1 .",
    "assume that for all @xmath211 , @xmath210 gives the same probability to all the balls in @xmath156 of radius @xmath212 ( in the metric @xmath133 ) ; then @xmath213 .",
    "if @xmath210 is invariant under all isometries for the metric @xmath133 , then @xmath213 .",
    "both characterizations are classical ; the first one is ( a strengthening of ) the definition of the riemannian volume , and the second one follows from the first and the fact that any two points on the round sphere can be mapped one to the other by an isometry .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spherical_culture ] , we represent a distribution with 100  agents drawn uniformly and independently on the sphere , with 4 candidates .",
    "like for figure  [ fig : sum_vectors ] , we represented only the unit sphere of @xmath54 .",
    "the solid dark lines draw the _ permutohedron _ , a geometrical figure representing the ordinal aspect of these preferences .",
    "each _ facet _ is constituted of all the points who share the same strict order of preference .",
    "a utility vector belongs to an _ edge _ if it has only three distinct utilities : for example , if the agent prefers candidate 1 to 4 , 4 to 2 and 3 , but is indifferent between candidates 2 and 3 .",
    "finally , a point is a _ vertex _ if it has only two distinct utilities : for example , if the agent prefers candidate 1 to all the others , but is indifferent between the others .    in this distribution",
    ", each agent has almost surely a strict order of preference .",
    "each order has the same probability and agents are independent , hence this distribution is a natural generalization of the impartial culture when considering expected utilities .    since the point @xmath35 is a geometrical singularity , it is difficult to include it naturally in such a measure .",
    "if one wants to take it into account , the easiest way is to draw it with a given probability and to use the distribution on @xmath214 in the other cases .",
    "that being said , we have just noticed that all other non - strict orders have a measure equal to 0 ; so for a canonical theoretical model , it can be argued that a natural choice is to attribute a measure 0 to the indifference point also .",
    "having a distance , hence a uniform measure , allows also to define other measures by their densities with respect to the uniform measure .",
    "here is an example of a law defined by its density . given a vector @xmath215 in the unit sphere of @xmath54 and @xmath216 a nonnegative real number , the von mises  fisher ( vmf ) distribution of pole @xmath215 and concentration @xmath216 is defined by the following density with respect to the uniform law on the unit sphere in @xmath54 : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a normalization constant .",
    "given the mean resultant vector of a distribution over the sphere , vmf distribution maximizes the entropy , in the same way that , in the euclidean space , gaussian distribution maximizes the entropy among laws with given mean and standard deviation .",
    "hence , without additional information , it is the `` natural '' distribution that should be used .",
    "figure  [ fig : vmf ] represents such a distribution , with the same conventions as figure  [ fig : spherical_culture ] . to draw a vmf distribution , we used ulrich s algorithm revised by wood @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , vmf model is similar to mallows model , which is used for ordinal preferences @xcite . in the",
    "later , the probability of an order of preference @xmath152 is : @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the mode of the distribution , @xmath221 a distance between @xmath152 and @xmath220 ( typically kendall s tau distance ) , @xmath216 a nonnegative real number ( concentration ) and @xmath222 a normalization constant .",
    "both vmf and mallows models describe a culture where the population is polarized , i.e. scattered around a central point , with more or less concentration .",
    "however , there are several differences .",
    "* vmf distribution allows to draw a specific point on the utility sphere , whereas mallows chooses only a facet of the permutohedron .",
    "* in particular , the pole of a vmf distribution can be anywhere in this continuum .",
    "for example , even if its pole is in the facet @xmath223 , it can be closer to the facet @xmath224 than to the facet @xmath225 .",
    "such a nuance is not possible in mallows model .",
    "* in the neighborhood of the pole , vmf probability decreases like the exponential of the square of the distance ( because the inner product is the cosine of the distance ) , whereas mallows probability decreases like the exponential of the distance ( not squared ) .",
    "* vmf is the maximum entropy distribution , given a spherical mean and dispersion ( similarly to a gaussian distribution in a euclidean space ) , whereas mallows model is not characterized by such a property of maximum entropy .",
    "the existence of a canonical measure allows to define other probability measures easily in addition to the two we have just described .",
    "such measures can generate artificial populations of agents for simulation purposes .",
    "they can also be used to fit the data from real - life experiments to a theoretical model , and as a neutral comparison point for such data .    to elaborate on this last point ,",
    "let us stress that given a ( reasonably regular ) distribution @xmath210 on a space such as @xmath156 there is _ a priori _ no way to define what it means for an element @xmath31 to be more probable than another one @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , both have probability @xmath226 and what would make sense is to compare the probability of being close to @xmath31 to the probability of being close to @xmath84 .",
    "but one should compare neighborhoods of the same size , and one needs a metric to make this comparison .",
    "alternatively , if one has a reference distribution such as @xmath209 , then it makes sense to consider the density @xmath227 , which is a ( continuous , say ) function on @xmath156",
    ". then we can compare @xmath228 and @xmath229 to say whether one of these elements is more probable than the other according to @xmath210 .",
    "note that in the present case , comparing the probability of @xmath212-neighborhoods for the metric @xmath133 or the density relative to @xmath209 gives the same result in the limit @xmath230 , which is the very definition of the riemannian volume .",
    "we have studied the geometrical properties of the classical model of expected utilities , introduced by von neumann and morgenstern , when candidates are considered symmetrical _ a priori_. we have remarked that the utility space may be seen as a dual of the space of lotteries , that inversion and summation operators inherited from @xmath1 have a natural interpretation in terms of preferences and that the space has a spherical topology when the indifference point is removed .",
    "we have proved that the only riemannian representation whose geodesics coincide with the projective lines naturally defined by the summation operator and which respects the symmetry between candidates is a round sphere .",
    "all these considerations lay on the principle to add as little information as possible in the system , especially by respecting the _ a priori _ symmetry between candidates .",
    "this does not imply that the spherical representation of the utility space @xmath83 is the most relevant one in order to study a specific situation .",
    "indeed , as soon as one has additional information ( for example , a model that places candidates in a political spectrum ) , it is natural to include it in the model .",
    "however , if one wishes , for example , to study a voting system in all generality , without focusing on its application in a specific field , it looks natural to consider a utility space with a metric as neutral as possible , like the one defined in this paper by the spherical representation ."
