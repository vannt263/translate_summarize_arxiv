    "normalized histograms of occurrence of the allowed values of the correlation function ( or , rather more frequent below , of its logarithm ) are produced by dividing a convenient interval of variation of @xmath25 ( or @xmath27 ) into @xmath28 equal - width bins , and assigning each particular realization to the appropriate bin .",
    "for @xmath27 the interval ranging from @xmath29 to zero has proved generally adequate , except for @xmath30 where the lower limit was pushed down to @xmath31 .    for strictly one - dimensional disordered systems ( _ i . e. _ , chains ) the average free energy ( related to the largest lyapunov exponent ) has a normal distribution  @xcite , as befits a sum of random variables .",

    "however , the analysis of correlation functions turns out to be more complex than that of the free energy , even on chains ; a primary reason for this is that while the latter quantity is self - averaging in the sense defined above , the former is not : the usual brout argument  @xcite can not be applied , as explained _",

[ fig:1 ] where the horizontal variable is @xmath38 , which turns out to be convenient for most purposes ( see below ) .",

    "it has been found in monte - carlo simulations  @xcite that the average correlation function at criticality of a random - bond ising system is numerically very close to that for a pure system at its own critical point .",
    "below we check on the corresponding quantities for the strip geometry .",

    "of course the present result reaches further , as one could conceive of a scenario where the correlations would differ in the pure and random systems , but decay asymptotically as @xmath36 with the same rate ( thus giving the same @xmath67 ) .",
    "in fact , the decay of @xmath62 against @xmath3 is not too dissimilar to that of @xmath39 for moderate disorder , and for the finite values of @xmath4 within reach of calculation .",
    "only a systematic study of extrapolation trends as @xmath59 , covering different degrees of disorder , shows how the respective correlation lengths are essentially distinct  @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this lies in that , on account of the properties of the probability distribution of @xmath25 ( to be seen in detail below ) , the _ most probable _ value @xmath62 does not coincide with the _ average _ one , @xmath39",
    "accordingly , it has been shown by field - theoretic arguments  @xcite and supported by numerical work  @xcite that the most probable , or typical , correlation function decays as @xmath72 while the logarithmic corrections are washed away upon averaging for @xmath39 , resulting in a purely algebraic decay with @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig:3 ] shows that , considering the central estimates @xmath39 the ratio @xmath73 is , in all cases , within @xmath74 . with estimated error bars of order @xmath56",

    "monte - carlo data show the corresponding ratio approaching unity from below as lattice size @xmath4 increases  @xcite , in the region @xmath75 .",
    "we can not go far into that region , as the maximum strip widths within reach are not much larger than 10 , and randomness effects are significantly distorted for small @xmath76 .",
    "though we are not able at this point to advance a quantitative argument , it is plausible that finite - size effects manifest themselves differently in strip and square geometries ; taken together with those of ref .",
    ", we interpret our data as evidence in favour of pure and random  system critical correlations being in fact equal , at least for @xmath3 , @xmath77 and @xmath75 .    in the next two sections ,",
    "we exploit the features of the probability distribution of @xmath25 , and show that the variable @xmath6 is indeed at least approximately the convenient one to describe several relevant aspects of the problem .",
    "our starting point is the result that , in one dimension and for large @xmath3 the probability distribution of @xmath25 must be log - normal  @xcite . the same is expected to hold on strips provided that @xmath7 .",

    "bond paths , thus the peak at large @xmath27 with an abrupt cutoff above the maximum ; on the other hand , configurations without any strong ",
    "bond paths at all are possible but with low probability , giving rise to the `` tail '' of very low @xmath27 values .",

    "we choose to characterize the distribution of @xmath27 by three quantities , namely mean ( @xmath40 ) , dispersion , or root - mean - square deviation ( @xmath42 ) and skewness ( @xmath79 ) .",

    "as shown below , this works well in the present case of ferromagnetic disorder .",
    "if frustration effects are present , such as _ e. g. _ in random - field  @xcite or spin - glass systems , it may be necessary to take recourse to additional parameters , or even to adopt a different perspective .",
    "we shall not deal with this matter in the present work .",
    "the aspects just described are consistent with a scaling description given in this subsection .",
    "it leads to further specific predictions regarding the form of distribution functions and their dependences on the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which will be discussed subsequently in the light of the numerical results .",
    "the approach combines two main features : @xmath95 the appearance at large scales @xmath4 , @xmath96 of universal aspects related to fixed point hamiltonian and probability distributions of the disordered two - dimensional ( @xmath97 ) ising model ; and @xmath98 the crossover for @xmath99 to width ",

    "we have studied properties of the probability distributions of correlation functions on finite - width strips of the two - dimensional random - bond ising model at criticality .",
    "we have shown that even though intrinsic fluctuations in the probability distribution do not die away for large samples , the sample - to - sample fluctuations of averaged values do go down approximately with the square root of sample size as the latter increases .",
    "results thus obtained for averaged critical correlations have been compared with those for a pure system , and we have found that the values of averaged correlations @xmath189 are very close to the corresponding pure - system ones , consistent with recent monte - carlo data  @xcite .",
    "the key features of the shape of distributions have been identified , and a simplified scaling theory has been formulated , which provides the essential aspects of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 dependence .",
    "numerical data for the probability distributions of correlation functions bear out the main predictions of scaling theory , in particular the role played by the combination @xmath6 as an appropriate scaling variable .",
    "we expect the approach outlined above , which consists in describing the probability distribution of @xmath27 by perturbative corrections to a log - normal form ( thus characterized by only three quantities , namely mean ( @xmath40 ) , width ( @xmath42 ) and skewness ( @xmath79 ) ) to be appropriate in the present case of ferromagnetic disorder ; it remains to be checked whether additional parameters , or even a change of perspective , will be necessary if frustration effects are present , _",
    "e. g. _ in random - field  @xcite or spin - glass systems .",
    "we plan to undertake this task as a continuation of the present work .",
    "sladq thanks the department of theoretical physics at oxford , where most of this work was carried out , for the hospitality , and the cooperation agreement between academia brasileira de cincias and the royal society for funding his visit .",
