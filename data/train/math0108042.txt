    "in particular it is proved that @xmath5 is analytic and that has a zero of order at least @xmath113 , when @xmath114 .",
    "thus we aim at getting joint solutions to @xmath96 and @xmath115 in the form of formal power series @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath70 commutes with @xmath69 we look at the linear map defined by it on the vector space @xmath117 of all formal solutions of @xmath96 .",

    "when @xmath51 the isomorphism @xmath121 must be redefined and the corresponding matrix @xmath71 is not as simple as the one obtained when @xmath129 .",
    "this suggest that our choice of the function @xmath5 associated to a spherical function is most appropriate only when @xmath129 .    in section [ solutions ]",
    "we illustrate in full detail the results obtained above in the cases @xmath130 and @xmath131 an arbitrary integer .",
    "the main ingredient here is a particular class of generalized hypergeometric functions among those of the form @xmath8 . for each @xmath33",

    "there is not enough room for this phenomenon to show up .",
    "we state a fairly explicit conjecture on the dependence of these hypergeometric functions on its main parameters , namely the ones that are not related by the shift described above . these two numerator parameters and the denominator one exhaust the ones that appear in the case of @xmath101 .    in view of the very important role played by all functions @xmath8 , @xmath132 arbitrary , in our description of the entries of the matrix valued spherical functions",
    ", it is worth to note that certain generalized hypergeometric functions , more precisely the functions @xmath136 , have appeared in the expression of matrix entries of representations of the group u@xmath137 . in this case",
    "one can consult @xcite as well as the very systematic treatment in @xcite .",
    "this very nice result extends to the case of arbitrary @xmath131 the well known results involving gauss function @xmath101 in the case of u@xmath138 .",
    "it would be nice to see the functions identified here playing a useful role in other problems in geometry or physics .",
    "in section [ recur ] we observe that our spherical functions satisfy not only a differential equation , but also an appropriate recursion relation in the discrete variable @xmath98 .",
    "we display the results in full in the case @xmath139 and @xmath131 nonnegative .",
    "this three term recursion relation is well known in the classical case , when @xmath100 , and it gives the main way to compute in a numerically stable way the so called classical orthogonal polynomials .",
    "its importance is not only a practical matter .",
    "it gives one of the earliest instances of the bispectral property . by repeated applications of the darboux process this innocent looking property",
    "is tied up with all sorts of other issues of recent interest in mathematical physics , including nonlinear integral evolution equations , @xmath140-algebras , interesting isomonodromy deformations , the whole area of random matrix models , etc .",
    "there are even @xmath141 versions of all of this .",
    "moreover this is not restricted to the case of one ( either spatial or spectral ) variable .",
    "it is natural to wonder about the relation between the matrix valued functions constructed in section 12 and the relatively new theory of matrix valued orthogonal polynomials .",
    "this issue has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "it suffices to state here that the functions considered in section 12 do not satisfy all the conditions in the theory , see for instance @xcite .",
    "finally we remark that we have chosen this example as one of the simplest to analyze among the symmetric spaces of rank one leading to matrix valued spherical functions .",
    "we hope to deal with other simple examples in the near future .",
    "one important case of scalar valued spherical functions of non trivial type has been considered in part i , chapter 5 of @xcite .",
    "the referee has wondered what is the perspective for doing analogous things in the case of su@xmath137 , and e. stein had also suggested to consider this more general problem . at this point",
    "this appears to be a very interesting challenge .",
    "one can only speculate that many of the connections that make gauss function a vital part of mathematics at the end of the twenty century will be shared by its matrix valued version discussed here .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the referee for a very thorough job .",

    "<S> the main purpose of this paper is to compute all irreducible spherical functions on @xmath0 of arbitrary type @xmath1 , where @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by associating to a spherical function @xmath3 on @xmath4 a matrix valued function @xmath5 on the complex projective plane @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that there is a fruitful connection between the hypergeometric function of euler and gauss and the spherical functions of trivial type associated to a rank one symmetric pair @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> but the relation of spherical functions of types of dimension bigger than one with classical analysis , has not been worked out even in the case of an example of a rank one pair . </S>",
    "<S> the entries of @xmath5 are solutions of two systems of ordinary differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> there is no ready made approach to such a pair of systems , or even to a single system of this kind . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the situation is very favorable and the solution to this pair of systems can be exhibited explicitely in terms of a special class of generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath8 . </S>"
