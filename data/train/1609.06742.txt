    "when and how mutants spread in wildtype populations is an important question in population dynamics ; answering it has implications in bacterial evolution , cancer initiation , viral dynamics and for the understanding of social phenomena @xcite .",
    "while the behaviour of populations has traditionally been described mostly with deterministic models @xcite , it is increasingly recognised that the fate of invading mutants can be influenced by random genetic drift .",
    "work from recent decades reflects this shift in modelling , and much current research is concerned with the properties of stochastic evolution in finite populations @xcite .",
    "mathematical models of stochastic evolution typically describe a population of individuals who can each be of one of several types or species .",
    "often the interactions between species follow a birth ",
    "death process ; individuals of one type may generate offspring at the expense of other individuals who are removed from the population .",
    "these events occur stochastically and their rates are determined by the relative reproductive fitnesses of the different species ; these fitnesses in turn depend on the composition of the population @xcite .    within this framework",
    "the success or otherwise of a mutant is determined by the end states of the population dynamics . in absence of _ de novo _ mutations , the dynamics of a finite population will eventually come to a halt when all but one species have gone extinct .",
    "this indicates that an initial mutant will either have reached fixation ( i.e. the mutation has spread ) or extinction , see for example @xcite .",
    "one central objective from the theoretical point of view is then to obtain ( analytically or numerically ) the probability that the mutant takes over , as opposed to going extinct , and to understand the mechanisms that promote or suppress the success of the mutant .",
    "fixation probabilities and mean fixation times can be computed for stylised models using techniques from the theory of stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "one of the most common setups is that of a model describing the selection dynamics of two species in a well - mixed population of fixed size .",
    "such models have only one degree of freedom ( the number of individuals of one of the two species ) , and the typical outcome can be characterised relatively easily . to keep the population size constant a birth ",
    "death process is assumed .",
    "more recently work has also focused on models with populations of dynamic size .",
    "et al . _ have investigated the impact that demography has on the spread of cooperation in the prisoners dilemma game @xcite .",
    "other evolutionary game formats have also been studied in populations of time - dependent size @xcite . in these models growth",
    "is limited by an overall carrying capacity .",
    "the effect of population growth has also been considered in host  parasite interactions @xcite , and in spin systems @xcite .",
    "other work specifically focuses on range expansions in space @xcite .    in models combining selection and growth , an interesting interplay between deterministic flow and intrinsic noise",
    "is to be expected . in populations of constant size @xmath0 ,",
    "intrinsic stochasticity has an amplitude of order @xmath1 relative to deterministic selection .",
    "for very large populations noise can therefore essentially be neglected , and deterministic flow ( describing selection ) governs the dynamics .",
    "selection can then , for example , have an internal stable fixed point , leading to the coexistence of two species ; fixation and extinction are absent in this deterministic scenario .",
    "fixation or extinction can and will occur in finite populations , however , as these phenomena are driven by the intrinsic noise .",
    "a growing population presents an interesting intermediate case ; if its initial size is small , demographic stochasticity shapes the outcome in the early phases .",
    "as the population grows the strength of the noise gradually reduces , and in the later stages deterministic flow dominates over random drift .",
    "the speed of growth determines how long intrinsic noise is relevant before the deterministic flow takes over .",
    "the purpose of our work is to investigate this in more detail and to characterise the outcome of evolution for different speeds of population growth .    to address this question",
    "we study a model of two interacting species .",
    "we are interested in the fixation properties of a single mutant which is introduced into a wild - type population .",
    "the population is subject to birth ",
    "death dynamics in the form of a two - player two - strategy evolutionary game .",
    "we consider scenarios described by different evolutionary games , in particular the cases of the well - known dominance , coordination and coexistence games @xcite .",
    "individuals also have the propensity to reproduce , so that the size of the population increases .",
    "growth in our model is governed by an externally - controlled per - capita reproduction rate , @xmath2 , which may depend on the current population size and/or have an explicit time dependence .",
    "this sector of the model describes reproduction in the absence of between - species interactions .",
    "this could be driven , for example , by the availability of nutrients .",
    "the objective of this choice of model structure is to decouple the effects of selection from population growth ",
    "the growth process itself does not favour any of the two species . by varying the growth law",
    "we can systematically test the effect of population growth on the evolutionary outcome .",
    "this is much harder to do in models in which birth events combine growth and selection , as the growth law then ` emerges ' from the population itself , and can not easily be controlled externally .",
    "we predominantly focus on a population whose size roughly follows a power - law in time .",
    "this is motivated as follows : under simple birth ",
    "death dynamics the variance of the number of mutants grows linearly in time .",
    "this process corresponds to a biased random walk , and expressions for the variance have been obtained , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we can expect that the number of mutants in different realisations of the process will differ within a range proportional to the standard deviation , growing as @xmath3 . imposing additional population growth , with no advantage to either species ,",
    "effectively induces a growing boundary for this random - walk problem .",
    "the most interesting scenarios are to be expected when the growth of the domain ( i.e. the population size ) and the typical deviations from the mean of mutant numbers follow similar laws . the boundaries of the domain are then ` reachable ' , so that fixation and extinction may occur . on the other hand intrinsic noise",
    "does not dominate so that arrival at the boundaries may not necessarily be certain .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the mathematical details of our model . to set the scene we then briefly discuss its deterministic flow , i.e. we describe how the population would evolve in the absence of stochasticity .",

    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider a well - mixed growing population of discrete individuals .",
    "each member of the population can be one of two types , @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "we will refer to species @xmath4 as the ` mutant ' type , and @xmath5 as the ` wildtype ' .",

    "is the number of individuals of type @xmath4 ( mutants ) , and @xmath8 is the total number of individuals in the population . the number of individuals of type @xmath5 ( wildtypes ) can be written as @xmath9 .",
    "generally we are interested in the fate of a single mutant in a population of wildtype individuals .",
    "for the dynamics we consider two types of discrete events : competition between the species , and growth of the population .",
    "competition ( or selection ) in our model is governed by transitions of the type @xmath10 , i.e. replacement of an individual by another of the opposite type .",
    "the total number of individuals in the population does not change in such events .",
    "we use the framework of evolutionary game theory to describe these interactions @xcite . the likelihood for one type to succeed over the other in a competition event is characterised by the individuals expected payoffs within the population ; these are written as @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively for members of the two types ; their precise form will be defined below . in our model",
    "the rates at which these selection events happen are given by @xmath13 this follows the lines for example of @xcite .",

    "death events are governed by the competition kernel @xmath14 .",

    "the parameter @xmath16 is the intensity of selection : for @xmath17 evolution is neutral with no selection bias in favour of either species , for larger values of @xmath18 the payoffs determine the direction of selection .",
    "we focus on the case of frequency - dependent selection ; the expected payoffs of the two species depend on the current composition of the population .",
    "as is often done in the existing literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) we assume that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are determined by a two - person game with payoff matrix @xmath19 the entry @xmath20 describes the payoff an individual of type @xmath4 receives from an interaction with another individual of type @xmath4 .",

    "these include cases in which one species strictly dominates the other , as well as cases that promote coexistence of the species or lead to bistability in coordination games .",
    "the growth of the population occurs through events of the type @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the former case an individual of type @xmath4 ( mutant ) reproduces , in the latter",
    "an individual of type @xmath5 ( wildtype ) generates an offspring .",
    "these processes occur without the removal of any existing member of the population , such that the overall size of the population increases .",
    "they happen with rates @xmath27 respectively .",

    "the construction of our model allows us to investigate the different behaviours arising for different speeds of growth , and to highlight features which are dependent on the growth of the population .",
    "our results below shows that the choice of power - law growth captures non - trivial behaviour ; in particular we find that a single mutant can be most successful at intermediate choices of the growth exponent . in principle",

    "we consider multiple combinations of the growth exponent @xmath82 , the selection strength @xmath18 , and the location of the unstable fixed point @xmath86 . the data in fig .",

    "an intuitive understanding of this behaviour can be obtained as follows : in the initial phases of the dynamics the population is small , and the effects of intrinsic noise dominate .",
    "different realisations of the stochastic process will lead to fractions of mutants spread across the interval @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 is the proportion of mutants in the population ) .",
    "crucially , these occupy both the region to the left of the unstable internal fixed point ( @xmath96 ) , and the region to the right ( @xmath97 ) . with time the population grows , and",

    "trajectories to the left of the fixed point will experience an increasing pull towards extinction of the mutant , whereas those to the right of @xmath86 lead to fixation of the mutant .    for small growth exponents",
    "@xmath82 the population size remains close to @xmath79 for a long time .",
    "thus the effects of selection do not set in in the early stages , and the mutant number can cross back and forth over the fixed point until one of the absorbing boundaries is reached .",
    "the fixation probability is essentially that of a coordination game in a population of constant and relatively small size .    at moderate @xmath82",
    "the population undergoes an initial phase of relatively free exploration , populating the basins on both sides of the fixed point . as the population grows the deterministic pull sets in .",
    "realisations that are to the right of the fixed point , and which could normally have diffused back and led to extinction of the mutant are prevented from doing so ( statistically ) and reach fixation instead ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "similarly realisations to the left of @xmath86 , which may ultimately have crossed the fixed point again and lead to fixation in the absence of growth , now lead to extinction of the mutant ( @xmath87 ) due to the onset of deterministic pull . if the fixed point is close to the extinction state the former effects outweighs the latter .",
    "this results in an increased net probability for the mutant to reach fixation rather than extinction .    at large values of the growth exponent , the deterministic pull sets in very quickly .",
    "the period of initial ( nearly ) free drift is short , and the mutants do not have time to expand and populate the basin to the right of the fixed point . broadly speaking the number of mutants remains small , and they quickly experience an increasing pull towards extinction .",
    "the chances for the mutant to reach fixation are reduced . in the extreme case of very quick growth ( @xmath98 )",
    "the system becomes effectively deterministic immediately , hence @xmath99 .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4-fixationcoord ] .",
    "we next briefly discuss the effects of the selection strength , @xmath18 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4-fixationcoord](a ) , increasing the selection strength moves the maximum in fixation probability towards lower values of the growth exponent @xmath82 .",
    "this appears natural as increased selection indicates stronger deterministic flow at any given size of the population .",
    "if selection is too strong the mutants are unlikely to overcome the initial barrier of adverse selection , even for moderate growth exponents .",
    "we then find monotonically decreasing dependence of fixation probability on the growth exponent @xmath82 .",
    "the above interpretation also suggests that the location of the internal fixed point might be relevant .",
    "as described , the initial increase in fixation probability with the growth exponent is due to the gradual ` trapping ' of realisations by the increasing deterministic pull .",
    "an increased fixation probability is thus only to be expected if the basin to the right of @xmath86 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4-fixationcoord](b ) , where we demonstrate that the maximum in @xmath91 as a function of the growth exponent @xmath82 is only present if @xmath86 is sufficiently small .",
    "if the fixed point is too far from the initial condition @xmath100 only very few runs are able to cross the barrier before the increasing deterministic pull confines them to the extinction basin .",
    "thus , when @xmath86 is large , we find monotonically decreasing fixation probability as growth increases .",
    "this interplay between @xmath91 and @xmath86 is reminiscent of the so - called ` one - third law ' in evolutionary game theory , which is valid for populations of fixed finite size @xmath0 interacting in a coordination game .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the effects of population growth on the outcome of stochastic evolutionary games .",
    "while the stochastic dynamics of @xmath143 evolutionary games in constant - size populations is largely understood , we find new features in growing populations .",
    "to systematically study these effects we have disentangled growth and selection , and assume that both species in the population grow at the same ( per capita ) rate .",
    "we impose an external time - dependence on these rates ; while this can be interpreted as an experimental protocol in which the availability of nutrients is varied in time , our main objective is to generate specific growth laws of the population .",
    "we focus on the case of power - law growth , @xmath144 , and control the growth exponent @xmath82 .",
    "the most interesting behaviour arises in coordination and coexistence games ; we study scenarios in which a single mutant tries to invade a wildtype population .",
    "we find that intermediate growth rates can lead to the maximum chance of success of the mutant ; if growth is too fast or too slow ( or non - existent ) , the ability for the mutant to invade is compromised .",
    "this effect is present in both classes of games ; the origin of this effect is different in the two cases , though .    in coordination games ,",
    "the mutant will either become extinct or reach fixation eventually .",
    "population growth increases the effect of selection over time relative to intrinsic noise . in the later stages of the process",
    "this prevents the mutant number from crossing the barrier separating the basins of attraction of extinction and fixation , and shifts the balance between the two outcomes .",
    "these effects also lead to the breakdown of the one - third law of coordination games .    in coexistence games , a growing population can promote indefinite coexistence of the mutant and wildtype individuals . by effectively decreasing the magnitude of intrinsic fluctuations , population growth confines the fraction of mutants to the region near the deterministic coexistence point .",
    "if the growth rate is moderate , selection is strong enough initially to prevent extinction but leaves the population size small enough to be able to eventually escape from coexistence to fixation of the mutant .",
    "we have also proposed an approximation of the dynamics in terms of a single stochastic differential equation . here",
    "the amplitude of multiplicative noise decreases gradually in time , representing the increasing population size .",
    "this equation is formulated ad - hoc and we make no claims of analytical rigour . however , we find good quantitative agreement with direct simulations .    introducing a variable population size has revealed interesting effects in many evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "we have continued this line of work and systematically investigated the fate of mutants in a growing population . in biological settings",

    "thus helps to bridge the gap between experimental work on growing and evolving populations , and theoretical understanding .    on a general level",
