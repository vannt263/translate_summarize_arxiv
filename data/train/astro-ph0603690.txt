    "dark energy ( de ) models with late time cosmic acceleration , such as the @xmath7-dominated cdm model , predict a slow down for the growth of the linear gravitational potential at moderate redshift @xmath8 , which can be observed as temperature anisotropies in the cmb : the so - called late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "the isw effect is expected to produce an increase of power ( a bump ) in the amplitude of the cmb fluctuations at the largest scales , ie lower order multipoles , which are dominated by cosmic variance .",
    "this expectation , seems challenged by observations , as the first year wmap results ( wmap1 ) confirmed the low amplitude of the cmb quadrupole first measured by cobe ( eg hinshaw 1996a ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the observations and the model is particularly evident in the temperature angular correlation function @xmath9 , which shows an almost complete lack of signal on angular scales @xmath10 degrees . according to spergel ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the probability of finding such a result in a spatially - flat cosmology is about @xmath11 .",
    "this was questioned in gaztaaga ( 2003 ) who found , using simulated wmap maps , a much lower significance ( less than 2-sigma ) for @xmath9 .",
    "a low significance was also estimated by different studies ( eg efstathiou 2003 , olivera - costa 2003 ) , although a discrepancy larger than 3-sigma still remains on both the quadrupole - octopole alignment ( tegmark , oliera - costa & hamilton 2003 , olivera - costa 2003 ) and the wmap observed high value of the temperature - polarization cross - correlation on large scales ( dor , holder & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "given the observed anomalies on the isw predictions , it is of particular interest to check if the isw effect can be detected observationally through an independent test , such as the cross - correlation of temperature fluctuations with local tracers of the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "a positive cross - correlation between wmap1 and galaxy samples from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) was first found by fosalba , gaztaaga & castander ( 2003 , fgc03 from now on ) and scraton ( 2003 ) .",
    "fgc03 used the 1yr wmap data ( wmap1 ) and the sdss data release 1 ( sdss1 ) .",
    "wmap1 has also been correlated with the apm galaxies ( fosalba & gaztaaga 2004 ) , infrared galaxies @xcite , radio galaxies @xcite , and the hard x - ray background @xcite .",
    "the significance of these cross - correlations measurements was low ( about 2 - 3 @xmath12 , see gaztaaga , manera & multamki 2006 for a summary and joint analysis ) , and many scientists are still skeptical of the reality of these detections .",
    "here we want to check if these results can be confirmed to higher significance using the sdss data release 4 ( sdss4 ) which covers @xmath13 times the volume of sdss1 . at the same time , we will compare the signal of the 1st and 3rd year wmap data ( wmap3 ) recently made public @xcite . with better signal - to - noise and better understanding of foreground contamination in wmap3",
    ", it remains to be seen whether the low significance signal of the wmap1-sdss1 analysis can be confirmed with wmap3-sdss4 , or if on the contrary this signal vanishes as systematic and statistical errors are reduced .",
    "in order to trace the changing gravitational potentials we use galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 @xcite , sdss4 hereafter , which covers 6670 deg@xmath14 ( i.e , 16@xmath15 of the sky ) . we have selected subsamples with different redshift distributions to check the reliability of the detection and to probe the evolution of the isw effect .",
    "all subsamples studied contain large number of galaxies , between 10@xmath16 - 10@xmath17 , depending on the subsample .",
    "we concentrate our analysis on the north galactic cap sdss4 area ( @xmath18 5500 deg@xmath14 ) , because it contains the most contiguous area .",
    "we have selected 3 magnitude subsamples with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and a high redshift luminous red galaxy ( lrg ; e.g. eisenstein 2001 ) color selected subsample ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) . because of the smaller volume , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 subsamples provide low signal - to - noise ( s / n@xmath252 ) in the cross - correlation with wmap , and we therefore center our analysis on the two deeper subsamples . the mask used for these data avoids pixels with observed holes , trails , bleeding , bright stars or seeing greater than 1.8 .    to model the redshift distribution of our samples",
    "we take a generic form of the type : n(z ) ~_g(z ) ~ ( z - z_c)^2   , for @xmath26 and zero otherwise .",
    "the @xmath27 distribution of the @xmath21 subsample is quite broad with @xmath28 and @xmath29 which results in a median redshift , @xmath30 ( e.g. , dodelson 2001 , brown 2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the lrg subsample has a narrower redshift distribution .",
    "the first colour cut is perpendicular to the galaxy evolutionary tracks in the ( g - r ) .vs.(r - i ) colour space and ensures that very few @xmath31 galaxies are selected , which translates into a cut @xmath32 in the above @xmath27 model .",
    "the second colour cut is parallel to evolution and perpendicular to spectral type differences and selects only red galaxies with old stellar populations .",
    "the faint magnitude limit ( @xmath33 ) cuts high redshift galaxies ( @xmath34 ) , which results in an overall median redshift of @xmath35 .",
    "we use the full - sky cmb maps from the third - year wmap data @xcite ( wmap3 from now on ) .",
    "in particular , we have chosen the v - band ( @xmath36 ghz ) for our analysis since it has a lower pixel noise than the highest frequency w - band ( @xmath37 ghz ) , while it has sufficient high spatial resolution ( @xmath38 ) to map the typical abell cluster radius at the mean sdss depth .",
    "we use a combined sdss+wmap mask that includes the kp0 mask , which cuts @xmath39 of wmap sky pixels @xcite , to make sure galactic emission does not affect our analysis .",
    "wmap and sdss data are digitized into @xmath40 pixels using the healpix tessellation .",
    "figure [ fig : sdsswmap ] shows how the wmap3 and sdss4 pixel maps look like when density and temperature fluctuations are smoothed on @xmath41 deg scale .",
    "we define the cross - correlation function as the expectation value of density fluctuations @xmath42 and temperature anisotropies @xmath43 ( in @xmath44k ) at two positions @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the sky : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , assuming that the distribution is statistically isotropic . to estimate @xmath49 from the pixel maps we use : w_tg ( ) = _ i , j _",
    "t(*_i * )   _ g(*_j * )  w_i  w_j , where the sum extends to all pairs @xmath50 separated by @xmath51 .",
    "the weights @xmath52 can be used to minimize the variance when the pixel noise is not uniform , however this introduces larger cosmic variance . here",
    "we follow the wmap team and use uniform weights ( i.e. @xmath53 ) .",
    "the resulting correlation is displayed in fig.[fig : wtg ] . on scales",
    "up to @xmath54 degrees we find significant correlation above the estimated error - bars .",
    "the dotted and continuous lines correspond to wmap1 and wmap3 data respectively , and show little difference within the errors .",
    "this indicates that the cross - correlation is signal dominated .",

    "we have used different prescriptions to estimate the covariance matrix : a ) jack - knife , b ) 2000 montecarlo simulations c ) theoretical estimation ( including cross - correlation signal ) both in configuration and harmonic space .",
    "our montecarlo simulations in b ) include independent simulations of both the cmb and galaxy maps , with the adequate cross - correlation signal .",
    "all three estimates give very similar results for covariance and the @xmath55 errors , details will be presented elsewhere ( fosalba 2006 ) .    to compare models we use a @xmath55 test : ^2 = _ i",
    ", j=1^n _ i   c_ij^-1   _ j , where @xmath56 is the difference between the `` estimation '' @xmath57 and the model @xmath58 .",
    "we perform a singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the covariance matrix @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a diagonal matrix with the singular values on the diagonal , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are orthogonal matrices that span the range and nullspace of @xmath63 .",
    "we can choose the number of eigenvectors @xmath64 ( or principal components ) we wish to include in our @xmath55 by effectively setting the corresponding inverses of the small singular values to zero .",
    "in practice , we work only with the subspace of  dominant modes \" which have a significant `` signal - to - noise '' ( s / n ) . the s / n of each eigenmode , labeled by @xmath65 , is :    ( ) _ i = | |= | _ j=1^n_b u_ji | . as s / n depends strongly on the assumed cosmological model ,",
    "we use the direct measurements of @xmath66 to estimate this quantity .",
    "the total s / n can be obtained by adding the individual modes in quadrature . in our analysis",
    "we have used 5 eigenmodes for the @xmath21 sample and 3 for the lrg sample .",
    "the results are similar if we use less eigenmodes . with more eigenmodes ,",
    "the inversion becomes unstable because we include eigenvalues which are very close to zero and are dominated by noise .",
    "isw temperature anisotropies are given by @xcite : ( ) = - 2 dz  d(,z ) where @xmath67 is the newtonian gravitational potential at redshift @xmath68 .",
    "one way to detect the isw effect is to cross - correlate temperature fluctuations with galaxy density fluctuations projected in the sky @xcite .",
    "it is useful to expand the cross - correlation @xmath69 in a legendre polynomial basis . on large linear scales and small angular separations",
    "it is :    w^isw_tg ( ) & = & _ l 2l+14 p_l ( ) c_gt^isw(l ) + c_gt^isw(l ) & = & 4 ( 2l+1)^2 dz w_isw(z ) w_g(z )",
    "h(z)c p(k ) + w_isw(z ) & = & 3 ( h_0/c)^2 d[d(z)/a]dz + w_g(z ) & = & b(z)_g(z ) d(z),where @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the survey galaxy selection function in eq.[[eq : n(z ) ] ] and @xmath72 is the comoving distance .",
    "this is just a legendre decomposition of the equations presented in fosalba & gaztaaga ( 2004 ) , see also afshordi ( 2004 ) .",
    "the advantage of this formulation is that we can here set the monopole ( @xmath73 ) and dipole ( @xmath74 ) contribution to zero , as it is done in the wmap maps .",
    "the contribution of the monopole and dipole to @xmath66 is significant and over predicts @xmath66 by about 10% .",
    "the power spectrum is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the transfer function , which we evaluate using the fitting formula of einseintein & hu 1998 .",
    "we make the assumption that on very large scales the galaxy distribution is a tracer of the underlaying matter fluctuations , related through the linear bias factor , @xmath77 .",
    "we estimate @xmath78 from the angular galaxy - galaxy auto - correlation @xmath79 in each sample by fitting to the linear flat model prediction @xmath79 and marginalizing over the value of @xmath80 .",
    "the models have @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . and are normalized to the value of @xmath86 that best fits wmap3 data ( spergel 2006 ) : @xmath87 . with this procedure",
    "we find a normalization of @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the @xmath21 and lrg samples respectively .",
    "we marginalize all our results over the uncertainties in both @xmath86 and @xmath90 .",
    "this also roughly accounts for the uncertainty in the selection function .",
    "the predictions of @xmath66 do no change much with the selection function ( see  4.1 in gaztaaga , manera & multamki 2006 ) , but the bias estimated from from @xmath91 depends strongly on the effective volume covered by @xmath71 . because of the marginalization our final results do not change much when we change the median redshift of the sample by @xmath92 , which represents current uncertainties in @xmath27 .",
    "but in the case of the lrg it is critical to include not only the correct value of the mean redshift ( or @xmath93 in eq.[[eq : n(z ) ] ] ) but also the redshift cut @xmath94 introduced by the color selection in eq.[[eq : n(z ) ] ] . in previous lrg cross - correlation analysis ( eg fgc03 & gaztaaga , manera & multamki 2006 ) the value of @xmath94",
    "was neglected .",
    "this can over predict @xmath95 , as estimated from @xmath91 , by a factor of two .",
    "uncertainties in the shape of @xmath27 considered here are within the normalization errors we have already included for @xmath86 and @xmath90 .",
    "we have also made predictions for the best fit wmap3 data with @xmath96 which gives different parameters and normalization ( @xmath97 ) and find very similar results .    under the above assumptions",
    "we are left with only one free parameter , which is @xmath80 or @xmath98 .",
    "fig.[fig : pdf ] shows the probability distribution estimated for @xmath99 from the @xmath100 analysis away from the minimum value @xmath101 .",
    "both samples prefer the same value of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a consistency check for the @xmath102 model .",
    "the combined best fit model has @xmath103 .",

    "we derive @xmath90 consistently from the galaxy - galaxy auto - correlation data .",
    "we also marginalize over the uncertainties in @xmath90 and over @xmath107 , to account for the wmap3 @xmath86 normalization for @xmath108 .",
    "the cosmological constant model @xmath5 , however , still remains a very good fit to the data .",
    "this is due to the large degeneracy of the equation of state parameter @xmath6 with @xmath2 .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by supernovae snia data ( eg see corasaniti , giannantonio and melchiorri 2005 and fig.8 in see gaztaaga , manera & multamki 2006 ) .",
    "the objective of our analysis was primarily to check if we could confirm or refute with higher significance the findings of the wmap1-sdss1 cross - correlation by fgc03 . with an increase in area of a factor of @xmath109 in sdss4 , larger signal - to - noise and better understanding of foregrounds in wmap3",
    ", our new analysis shows that the signal is robust .",
    "this is also in line with the first findings using optical ( apm ) galaxies by fosalba & gaztaaga ( 2004 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation signal in wmap3-sdss4 seems slightly larger than in previous wmap1-sdss1 measurements which results in slightly larger values for @xmath2 ( see fgc03 and gaztaaga , manera & multamki 2006 ) .",
    "this is probably due to sampling variance , as the sdss4 volume has increase by almost a factor of 4 over sdss1 .",
    "we find little difference within the errors in the cross - correlation of wmap1-sdss4 and wmap3-sdss4 ( see fig.[fig : wtg ] ) .",
    "the total s / n in eq.[ston ] of the wmap3-sdss4 correlation is @xmath110 for the @xmath21 sample and @xmath111 for the lrg , which gives a combined @xmath112 , assuming the two samples are independent .",
    "we have checked the validity of this assumption by doing a proper join analysis where we include the covariance between the two samples . for the join analysis",
    "we find a @xmath113 with the first 2 dominant eigenvectors and @xmath114 with 4 eigenvectors .",
    "we find that a @xmath115 model with @xmath116 successfully explains the isw effect for both samples of galaxies without need of any further modeling .",
    "the best fit for @xmath117 for each individual sample are very close .",
    "this is significant and can be understood as a consistency test for the model .",
    "the equation of state parameter appears to be very degenerate and it is not well constrained by current isw data alone ( see also corasaniti , giannantonio and melchiorri 2005 and gaztaaga , manera & multamki 2006 ) .",
    "upcoming surveys such as the dark energy survey ( des , www.darkenergysurvey.org ) , with deeper galaxy samples and more accurate redshift information should be able to break the @xmath118 degeneracy and maybe shed new light on the the nature of dark energy .",
