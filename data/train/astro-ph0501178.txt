    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes material from a donor ( secondary ) star , due to roche - lobe overflow ( see review by * ? ? ?",

    "periodic modulations of the optical flux  are attributed to this disk being asymmetric and/or tilted out of the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "there are several types of superhumps ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) .",
    "relevant to this paper are the orbital hump , common , permanent , and quiescent superhumps .",
    "the orbital hump is a signal in quiescence at the binary orbital frequency ; the common superhump  what is usually assumed when referring to superhumps  is a large amplitude signal whose period is a few percent longer than the orbital , decays in a matter of weeks , and is displayed in all su uma stars in outburst ; the permanent superhump lasts for months ( or longer ) and is not associated with eruption ; quiescent superhumps are rare , occur during phases of low luminosity , and have no apparent connection to other types of superhumps @xcite . in terms of observational terminology ,",
    "positive and negative refer to superhumps having periods greater or smaller than that of the binary s orbital period .",
    "positive superhumps are currently explained by the prograde precession of an elliptical accretion disk , relative to the orbit @xcite .",
    "it is proposed that negative superhumps arise when the disk also extends out of the orbital plane and the line of nodes undergoes retrograde precession due to the gravitational torque of the donor star @xcite .",
    "positive and negative superhumps have been observed to coexist ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though they may be present separately .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has completed over three years of a photometric imaging and spectroscopic surveying @xcite .",
    "although the prime aim of the spectroscopy is to measure redshifts of over one million galaxies and quasars , the color overlap between the quasars and cvs has resulted in numerous new identifications from the sdss spectra . to date , 88 new cvs have been discovered ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the sdss spectrum of sdss  j2100 ( see * ? ? ? * ) exhibits the narrow balmer emission and blue continuum typical of dwarf nova ( dn ) in outburst .",
    "moreover , earlier sloan photometry showed a magnitude of @xmath3 but the sdss spectrum is two magnitudes brighter , with a flux level equivalent to @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore obtained follow - up time - resolved photometry of sdss  j2100 at two different epochs , as well as a spectrum in quiescence to confirm its classification as a dn and to further delineate its characteristics .",

    "aperture photometry was performed on the reduced images within iraf .",
    "differential magnitudes were then calculated relative to a brighter local standard star in the field ( see figure  [ fig : find ] ) . photometry was obtained for three other stars of comparable brightness to verify stable photometric conditions .",

    "longer exposures of 210s were taken , giving 250s time resolution including dead - time .",
    "differential aperture photometry with no filter , relative to an ensemble of 14 local calibrated standard stars , was used to obtain an approximate @xmath5 band zeropoint .",

    "december 30 and 2004 october 13 , we obtained sets of spectra using the double - imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ; see table  [ tab : obslog ] ) .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 900 s to 1200 s. given the faintness of the target in 2003 december , the four spectra were co - added to yield sufficient signal - to - noise to identify and measure the emission lines ; hence , no time / phase resolution is available . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] we present the resulting low - resolution ( binned to 3 ) spectrum of sdss  j2100 in quiescence .",
    "the only prominent lines are those of h@xmath6 and h@xmath7 , both of which appear double - peaked ; we measure equivalent widths of @xmath8  and @xmath9  respectively . in 2004 october ,",
    "the lines were still weak , with h@xmath6 being 15.9  and h@xmath7 at 5.3 , although the system was almost 2 magnitudes brighter .",
    "the radial velocity curves ( from 13 spectra spanning 2.5 hr ) exhibit much scatter , only enabling us to estimate the orbital period as @xmath22 hr .",
    "we likely caught sdss  j2100 on decline from outburst maximum at this time  both its magnitude and line strengths are intermediate between the 2003 december observation and the original sdss spectroscopy ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    from figure",
    "[ fig : lcs ] and table  [ tab : obslog ] , it is clear that sdss  j2100 is highly variable on timescales from hours to months .",
    "the average magnitudes differ by @xmath22 between bright state ( 2003 july and 2004 october ) and faint state ( 2003 october and 2003 december ) observations .",
    "however , in both photometric observations , large amplitude variations on @xmath22 hr timescale are apparent , as are significant longer term trends .    to search for periodicities , we first removed the nightly long - term trends visible in figure  [ fig : lcs ] .",
    "for the two july datasets combined , we modeled the trend by @xmath23  d sinusoid . for the october curve we used a simple linear fit .",
    "using these de - trended data , we calculated lomb - scargle periodograms @xcite for each night and for the july dataset combined ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lsps ] ) . given the limited data spans relative to the @xmath22 hr modulation and non - sinusoidal morphology , we then used least squares fitting of a sinusoid plus the first harmonic model to refine the period determinations ; we included a sinusoid on the order of days and a linear component as free parameters to fit the longer term trends in each of the _ original _ july and october datasets respectively",
    ". from the combined july dataset we find a best fit period of @xmath0 hr . the one day alias at @xmath10 also fits the data , but with a @xmath11 almost twice as large ( also see increased scatter about mean phase folded curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fds ] ) , we discount this option . in october ,",
    "the best fit model yields a period of @xmath1",
    "hr , significantly different from the best fit in outburst . in all cases ,",
    "the errors are derived from the least - squares fitting , but were also double - checked in the frequency domain .",
    "we generated @xmath220,000 fake light curves , consisting of the de - trended , signal - subtracted magnitude values randomized over the time points , plus a simple sinusoid ( with randomized phase ) at the fundamental frequency .",
    "the width of the resulting peak frequency distribution from the respective lomb - scargle periodograms agreed with the light curve fits .",
    "we also note that aside from the 27 july data set , the period values were insensitive ( within the quoted errors ) to different choices of reasonable de - trend models .",
    "for the 27 july data set we conservatively quote an appropriately larger uncertainty .",
    "could this shorter 1.96  hr period be present in the july dataset ? in frequency space , it is sufficiently close to the 1.932  hr alias that confusion could occur .",
    "however , considering the time domain , if we require the hump profile to remain approximately the same from one night to the next , the full amplitude of any 1.96  hr signal must be @xmath12 mag .    from figure  [",
    "fig : lcs ] , it is clear that the @xmath22  hr modulations are non - sinusoidal and their morphology varies between july and october .",
    "even more striking is the difference in the amplitudes  they vary from 0.22  mag ( peak to peak ) in the bright state to 0.63  mag in the faint . to further examine the changes and periods",
    ", we folded the de - trended lightcurves on their candidate periods ( additionally phase binning the july data ) and converted the magnitudes to normalized intensity units , such that an intensity of 100 corresponds to the average @xmath5 magnitude of 16.3 on 2003 july 26 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fds ] ) . here",
    "we can clearly see the change in morphology from steeper rise to steeper decline between the two observations .",
    "lastly , it is interesting to note that in terms of intensity , the humps are twice as large in the bright state compared to the faint , with full amplitudes 20.2 ( phase binned ) versus 9.7 .",

    "considering the average magnitudes of sdss  j2100 at the various epochs , the 2 mag difference between observations is suggestive of the range seen in short - period dn , although we note that it is smaller than most ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the original sdss photometry , flagstaff photometry , and the 2003 december apo spectrum were likely taken in ( or in approach to ) quiescence , whereas it was observed near outburst during the original sdss spectroscopy , at mro , and at apo in 2004 october .",
    "the fact that we have observed sdss  j2100 three - times at @xmath28 suggests that we caught it close to maximum .",
    "moreover , the significant non - sinusoidal humps in our bright state photometry have the classic appearance of superhumps , as seen in su ursae majoris type dn during superoutburst . the observed period of 2.10  hr for sdss  j2100 at outburst and the 1.96  hr period in quiescence are sufficiently different ( 7@xmath29 ) that they can not be the same period ; i.e. , at least one of them must be a superhump .",
    "similar quiescent periodicities shorter than those in outburst have been seen in the su uma stars : v503  cygni and ir gem @xcite , where they were attributed to negative superhumps .",
    "it is instructive to compare the temporal properties of sdss  j2100 to those of the better studied su uma dn , v503  cygni .",
    "v503  cygni varies over four magnitudes from quiescence to maximum and has an orbital period of @xmath30 hr , as determined by a radial velocity study @xcite . from extensive photometric observations ,",
    "harvey et al . identified positive superhumps during superoutburst with a period of @xmath31 hr and peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.13 mag .",
    "more interestingly , v503  cygni exhibited periodic modulations in both outburst _ and _ quiescence with a period of @xmath32 hr , which was identified as a negative superhump .",
    "the amplitude of this negative superhump signal varied from 0.034 mag in outburst to 0.5 mag in quiescence ; in intensity units , however , the amplitudes of the negative superhumps were found to be constant within 30% . with a positive superhump period of 2.10",
    "hr , let us consider the two options for the origin of the 1.96  hr signal in sdss j2100 : modulation on the orbital period , or a negative superhump like in v503  cygni .",
    "if it is an orbital modulation , it is most readily explained as the varying light due to a hotspot .",
    "observing this would require a fairly high inclination ( @xmath33 ) , which is consistent with the pronounced central absorption of the emission lines in our outburst spectroscopy . on the other hand , such an identification would yield a superhump excess of @xmath34 , greater than any of the @xmath22  hr superhumps listed by @xcite , which are around 0.04 .",
    "instead , if the 1.96  hr signal is a negative superhump , the period difference is very close to other @xmath22  hr two - mode superhump variables , v503  cygni ( with 6.5% ) and v1974 cyg ( 7.3% * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can also use the two superhump excesses , taking @xmath35 from @xcite , to estimate the orbital period as @xmath36 hr ( where @xmath37 hr and @xmath38 hr ) .    llll v503  cygni & 3040 & 1323 & @xcite + sdss  j2100 & 37 & 14 & this paper + sx lmi & 83 & 5273 & @xcite +    since the negative superhump in v503  cygni was observed during outburst and quiescence , it qualifies as a permanent superhump .",
    "such a distinction can not yet be made for the sdss j2100 negative superhump  it could either be a purely quiescent or a permanent superhump .",
    "the positive superhumps for both systems suggest common superhumps , given their large amplitudes and , in the case of v503  cygni , a decay time on the order of weeks .",
    "if we take the 1.96 hr period to be a negative superhump , the positive superhump has an intensity amplitude 2 times greater than that of the quiescent negative superhump . for v503  cygni",
    ", we estimate this ratio to be 25 , which is comparable .",
    "however , there is one notable difference between the superhumps in the two systems . at outburst ,",
    "removal of the fundamental plus the first harmonic of the 2.1  hr signal from sdss j2100 does not reveal any signal near 1.96  hr , with a limiting amplitude roughly half of that in quiescence ( in intensity units ) .",
    "such a negative superhump was clearly discernible in the v503  cygni outburst data after similar subtraction of the positive superhump .",
    "perhaps the lack of this in sdss j2100 can be explained by our small data span .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that in july the negative superhump had a shape / amplitude more easily hidden beneath the large positive signal  we note that the shape of the negative superhump in v503  cygni is far from stable , appearing to evolve over time .",
    "such morphological variations may relate to the change in disk size between quiescence and ( super)outbursts , or could be a cyclic feature , recurring on the precession period of the tilted disk , as is seen in the dips of the low - mass x - ray binary with positive and negative superhumps , x1916 - 015/v1405 @xcite .",
    "there is one further similarity between sdss  j2100 and v503  cygni : the emission lines seen in figure  [ fig : spec ] appear fairly weak compared to the continuum level .",
    "indeed , the equivalent widths are lower than for most su uma systems in quiescence .    in table  [ tab : ews ] we summarize the results for h@xmath6 and h@xmath7 for sdss  j2100 , v503  cygni and a typical su uma dn , sx lmi .",
    "our results for sdss  j2100 lie well within the range measured for v503  cygni .",
    "they are both less than half the equivalent widths for sx lmi .",
    "we have presented evidence to support the classification of sdss  j2100 as a new dwarf nova ; more notably , one that exhibits negative superhumps in quiescence . in outburst photometry",
    ", we detect positive superhumps , placing it among the su uma group ; this is as expected , since its period places it ( just ) below the period gap @xcite . both photometrically and spectroscopically",
    ", sdss  j2100 appears to be an analog of the 1.9 hr system v503  cygni , showing similar large amplitude variability and relatively weak balmer lines in quiescence .",
    "additional spectroscopy and photometry are needed to further probe this unusual system .",
    "first , more extensive photometry should be done to confirm and further constrain the positive and negative superhump periods .",
    "especially useful would be the detection of the negative superhump during outburst ( this will complete the analogy with v503 cyg ) .",
    "second , more extensive , higher signal - to - noise phase - resolved spectroscopy will enable the system s orbital period to be determined .    funding for the creation and distribution of the sdss archive has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national aeronautics and space administration , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
