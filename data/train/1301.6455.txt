    "the higgs boson has been discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed information such as interaction strengths with each particle have not yet been tested very precisely .",
    "the most evident signal excess compared with the background at the both experiments ( atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite ) has been observed in the diphoton decay channel of the higgs boson .",
    "so far the reported rates of this channel are larger than the value predicted in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the second best excess was discovered by @xmath2 decay mode .",
    "we have also seen the small excess in the @xmath3 decay channel .",
    "the fermonic decay modes of the higgs boson have not yet established directly .",
    "the higgs sector of the sm is still uncertain , which can be extended in various ways .",
    "one of the promising extension is the supersymmetry , which is motivated by the stability of the higgs boson mass under the quantum corrections . in this model ,",
    "the higgs sector is required to have even number of the doublet .",
    "another interesting extension is the higgs triplet model  @xcite , which consists of the sm higgs doublet and a higgs triplet with @xmath4 . in this model ,",
    "majorana neutrino masses are generated from the small vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the triplet .",
    "since there are many extensions of the sm , we need to discriminate them from each other at further precision measurement of the higgs boson .",
    "the veltman s rho parameter  @xcite has been measured very precisely .",
    "it would be a good guiding principle to construct the beyond the sm .",
    "for an arbitrary number of @xmath0 scalar multiplets , which have an isospin @xmath5 , a hypercharge @xmath6 and a vev @xmath7 , the rho parameter at tree level is calculated as @xmath8\\ , v_\\phi^2 } { \\sigma_\\phi\\ , 2y_\\phi^2\\ , v_\\phi^2}. % -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the precision measurement suggests @xmath9 is very close to unity . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs doublet ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) predicts @xmath12 .",
    "the multi doublet extensions of the sm , e.g. , the minimal supersymmetric standard model , also predict @xmath12 at tree level .",
    "it is known that the next minimal representation , which satisfy @xmath12 , is a septet with @xmath13 , and the next next minimal one is a 26-plet with @xmath14 . in the usual higgs representation , the vev is bounded to be small . for instance , in the higgs triplet model which consists of a doublet and a triplet higgs fields , the vev of the triplet is constrained to be less than 3 gev ( @xmath15 level ) from @xmath16  @xcite , where @xmath17 . if we allow the cancellation among various contributions , the rho parameter can remain unity  @xcite .    in this paper , we construct a framework of the low energy effective theory , which contains a higgs doublet and a higgs septet with sizable vevs .",
    "the electroweak sector of the model is extended due to the presence of the septet , while keeping the rho parameter unity at tree level .",
    "the model is consistent with the electroweak precision data based on the @xmath18 and @xmath19 parameter analysis .",
    "the gauge coupling of the sm - like higgs boson can be largely deviated from the sm value due to the mixing with the septet component .",
    "the signal strengths of the higgs boson for the diphoton and for the weak gauge boson pair decays can be enhanced , while those for fermonic decay channels are suppressed .",
    "additional higgs bosons appear in the weak scale and would be discovered at the lhc . in particular , the singly charged higgs boson can be produced by the @xmath20 fusion mechanism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present a model which consists of a higgs doublet and a higgs septet . the electroweak precision constraints , and the signal strengths of the higgs bosons at the lhc are studied in section iii .",
    "the characteristic signatures of the extra ( septet - like ) higgs boson are discussed .",
    "conclusions and discussion are given in section iv .",
    "a scalar septet field @xmath21 with @xmath1 is introduced to the sm in addition to the sm higgs doublet @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the higgs potential is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we here introduce the symmetric tensor notation of the septet field as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "although the higgs septet can break the electroweak symmetry properly , the higgs doublet is required for the mass generation of sm fermions . without a non - renormalizable term with mass dimension seven , @xmath37",
    ", the higgs potential is conserved under an accidental global @xmath38 transformations of the doublet and the septet , separately .",
    "therefore , a breaking term of the global symmetry is added in order to avoid an exact massless nambu - goldstone boson .    as an example , the dimension seven operator can be generated from the one loop contribution given in fig .",
    "[ fig : dim7 ] by introducing two scalar quintuplets @xmath39 and a scalar triplet @xmath40 , which are odd under the extra discrete symmetry .",
    "the renormalizable lagrangian related to this one loop diagram is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a soft breaking mass parameter of the global @xmath38 symmetry , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the coupling constants . in the following discussion , we take into account the dimension seven operator instead of specifying the uv completion of the model without limiting the generality of the low energy effective theory .    , from the renormalizable uv theory . ]    if @xmath45 , the higgs septet and the higgs doublet develop the vevs independently .",
    "in this case , there are possibilities of the charge breaking vacua . in addition , the stability of the vacuum is unclear even in the charge conserving vacuum . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case with @xmath46 , where the vev of the higgs septet is induced through the higher dimensional operator , @xmath47 the vevs of the higgs doublet and septet are automatically aligned so that the charge conserving vacuum is realized .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the higgs potential are sufficiently small for simplicity . in this case",
    ", we can parametrize the model by only two parameters with the sm - like higgs boson mass as shown later .",
    "let us remind you that the septet quartic coupling constants generically produce mass splittings among the septet - like scalar bosons , and the latter coupling constants generate mixings between the doublet and the septet . in the following discussion , we mostly neglect the effect of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but a few important implications will be mentioned in the relevant parts .",
    "the mass matrices for the scalar sector are diagonalized by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the electroweak nambu - goldstone bosons , the ratio of vevs , @xmath53 , and the cp even scalar boson mixing , @xmath54 .",
    "note that the doublet vev is dominated in the large @xmath55 limit .",
    "mass eigenvalues are calculated as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "there are four input parameters .",
    "we here choose @xmath61 , @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 and @xmath55 .",

    "they coincide with @xmath63 value at the large @xmath55 region .",
    "mass splittings can be large in the small @xmath55 region , and @xmath69 is satisfied .",
    "we can see from eq .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the smoking gun of the septet contribution would be the presence of the @xmath74 vertex . this kind of the interaction is prohibited in the multi higgs doublet models , which give @xmath12 at tree level . the higher dimensional representation can generate this vertex , however the size of the coupling strength is suppressed by the small vev due to the strong constraint from the rho parameter .",
    "since the vev of the higgs septet with @xmath1 can be sizable , relatively large @xmath74 vertex is allowed . in this model",
    ", we have @xmath75 note that if the term proportional to @xmath76 exists in the higgs potential , @xmath65 also couples with @xmath77 via the mixing with @xmath78",
    ". if the charged higgs boson @xmath78 is sufficiently light and @xmath79 , @xmath78 can be produced by @xmath20 fusion at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the precision measurement of this coupling is possible at the ilc using the recoil method via @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the multiply charged higgs bosons is also an interesting feature of the model . due to the relatively large vev of the septet ,",
    "the doubly charged higgs boson in this model mostly decays into the same - signed weak gauge bosons and is produced via @xmath81 process .",
    "such a process has been studied  @xcite in the context of the higgs triplet model and the georgi - machacek model .",
    "the multiply charged higgs boson with electric charge higher than two has a long decay chain , which provide multiple weak boson final states .",
    "we have studied the model consists of the higgs doublet with @xmath23 and the higgs septet with @xmath1 .",
    "the vevs of the doublet and the septet preserve the electroweak rho parameter unity at tree level without any cancellation .",
    "the presence of the higgs septet can give substantial contributions to the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "a non - renormalizable operator is introduced in order to break the accidental global symmetry .",
    "a uv completion of the operator is also presented . from the view point of the uv completion",
    ", it would be difficult to introduce much higher dimensional representations with a sizable vev such as 26-plet with @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the higgs septet would only be a realistic possibility besides doublets    in this model , the gauge coupling constant of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath83 is predicted to be larger than that in the sm .",
    "we have shown the modified electroweak interactions due to the sizable vev of the higgs septet are consistent with the electroweak precision data .",
    "the signal strengths of the sm - like higgs boson at the lhc for the diphoton and for the weak boson pair decay modes are enhanced , while those for the fermonic decay channels are suppressed .",
    "the mass of the additional cp even neutral higgs boson @xmath84 is constrained by the current lhc data depending on the ratio of the vevs .",
    "the vev of the higgs septet induces sizable @xmath85 vertex ( @xmath86 is the charged higgs boson in the higgs septet ) , which is forbidden in the multi higgs doublet extension of the sm and is highly suppressed by the vev .",
    "e.g. , in the higgs triplet model .",
    "one of the interesting signature of the model would be the @xmath20 fusion production of the charged higgs boson at the lhc .",
    "the electroweak sector of the model has been discussed in this paper .",
    "we would like to mention the implications of the model .",
    "as we have slightly noted the diphoton decay rate of the sm - like higgs boson can be enhanced by the effects of the multiply charged higgs boson loops .",
    "such a effect generally requires larger coupling constants in the higgs potential .",
    "therefore , the mass degeneracy among the septet - like scalar bosons would be resolved .",
    "these mass splitting may give sizable contributions to the electroweak precision parameters as in the two higgs doublet models  @xcite .",
    "the potential parameters are further bounded by perturbative unitarity and the vacuum stability .",
