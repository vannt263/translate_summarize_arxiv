    "the estimate of black hole masses ( ) in distant galaxies is feasible only in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , where we can infer the dynamics of gas close to the black holes ( bhs ) through its bright continuum and line emission .",
    "a common practice for type-1 agn ( where broad emission lines are observed ) consists in adopting the virial paradigm : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the orbital radii and the velocity of the gas clouds in the broad line region ( blr ) , and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the cloud velocity is usually inferred from the width of broad lines , assuming a deprojection factor @xmath0 : @xmath8 while @xmath5 is derived from the continuum luminosity of the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "this allows an estimate of from single - epoch spectra : @xcite applied this technique to the huge spectroscopic sample of quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , thus providing for @xmath9 sources .",
    "the virial technique suffers of a number of limitations .",
    "in particular , the deprojection value @xmath0 is not known , and is strongly sensitive to the ( unknown ) geometry and orientation of the blr . in the commonly assumed isotropic picture of the blr , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "assuming instead a disc  like geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath11^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the aspect ratio of the disc and @xmath13 is the angle between the normal to the disc and the line of sight",
    ". in the limit of geometrically thin discs , equation  [ eq_disc ] reduces to @xmath14 , ranging between 0.5 ( edge - on discs ) and @xmath15 ( face - on discs ) . taking into account the thickness of the disc , @xmath16 when @xmath17 . for disc",
    " like blrs , @xmath18 almost independently of @xmath12 @xcite .    from an observational point of view",
    ", average values for @xmath0 have been estimated by comparing the mean offset of estimates based on different techniques .",
    "@xcite compared the values expected from the @xmath19 relation for a set of local type-1 agn with those obtained from the fwhm of through equation [ eq_virial ] , finding @xmath20h@xmath21 used in @xcite . ] .",
    "@xcite repeated the same exercise for a larger set of objects , and found a dependence of @xmath20h@xmath22 on the broad line width ( @xmath23 for fwhm@xmath242000 km / s , @xmath25 for fwhm@xmath266000 km / s ) , which could be attributed to the eddington factor or to the blr orientation .",
    "@xcite expanded on the previous results by @xcite , comparing virial estimates of based on and lines with those inferred from the host galaxy luminosities assuming the scaling in @xcite .",
    "they found @xmath20h@xmath27 , @xmath28@xmath29 and a strong dependence of @xmath0 on the widths of broad lines , i.e. , @xmath30 values are found only in quasars with fwhm@xmath245000 km / s ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the different values of @xmath31 for different broad emission lines can be explained by a different geometry of the corresponding emitting regions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite noticed that the claimed `` black hole mass deficit '' observed in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) disappears once a disc  like blr is assumed .",
    "nls1s show relatively narrow permitted lines ( 500 km / s @xmath24 fwhm @xmath24 2000 km / s ) , small with respect to the predictions from the host galaxy relations , and high eddington ratios . assuming that the blr is flat and seen almost pole - on , from the statistics of nls1s with respect to ` normal ' seyfert 1 galaxies we can infer the average @xmath0 value for nls1s .",
    "interestingly , once corrected for this higher deprojection values , line widths yield to distributions of and eddington ratios almost indistinguishable from normal seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the strong radio loudness with blazar - like properties observed in a large fraction of nls1 @xcite and the recent detection of gev emission in a handful of nls1s @xcite also reveal the presence of beamed emission almost aligned with the line of sight , supporting a pole - on picture of the central engine of these agn .",
    "other indications supporting a flat geometry for the blr come from 1 ) the anti - correlation between the width of broad emission lines and the `` compactness '' parameter defined from radio observations as the luminosity ratio between the core and the lobe emission in radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars @xcite ; 2 ) the dependence of the fwhm of broad lines on the equivalent width of the line @xcite .    in order to test the flat geometry picture of the blr ,",
    "we here extend our previous studies to blazars . according to the unified model of agn @xcite ,",
    "blazar jets ( and specifically bl lac objects ) are expected to show small inclination angles with respect to the line of sight .",
    "if the blr has a flat geometry with a rotational axis aligned to the jet , blazars should show relatively narrow fwhm of broad lines and high values of @xmath0 .",
    "we exploit a newly defined recipe to estimate the radius of the blr from the luminosity of broad lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to avoid the contamination from the jet light in the optical continuum emission .",
    "our virial estimates of are then compared to the estimates we have from the  relation in order to derive @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_sample ] we present our sample .",
    "our analysis is described in section [ sec_analysis ] , while in section [ sec_results ] we present our observational results and compare them with expectations from simple blr models .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec_conclusions ] . throughout the paper",
    "we will assume a concordance cosmology with @xmath32 km / s / mpc , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "results from other papers are accordingly scaled to this cosmology .",
    "in order to perform our analysis , we require an estimate of the host galaxy luminosity and a characterization of the properties ( flux , width ) of at least one broad line .",
    "the blazar sample is mostly derived from the compilations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "few other sources are taken from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we select all the blazars with a reliable estimate of the host galaxy luminosity .",
    "we adopt published values of @xmath35(host ) or convert available bands into @xmath36 computing the @xmath37-correction through the elliptical galaxy template by @xcite . out of this selection ,",

    "the former is the only broad line observed at @xmath39 .",
    "we preferred the latter rather than because it is @xmath40 brighter .",
    "the whole blazar sample consists of 18 objects .    in order to understand the role of orientation of the broad line region with respect to ` normal ' quasars , we include a comparison sample of quasars from the data set presented in @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the properties of the broad line region in blazars by comparing the virial estimate of black hole masses with that derived from the mass of the host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the former is sensitive to the width of broad lines , i.e. , to the projection of the velocity of line - emitting clouds along the line of sight ; the latter is not . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison allows us to constrain the deprojection factor @xmath0 , thus revealing general properties of the geometry of the broad line region . </S>",
    "<S> we show that blazars tend to have 1 ) higher @xmath0 values than the quasars of our reference sample : @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; 2 ) relatively narrow broad emission lines ; 3 ) modest equivalent widths , as expected because of the occurrence of jet emission at very low inclination angles . in a disc - like sketch of the broad line region , </S>",
