    "as a result of recent experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite work there is an emerging consensus that the symmetry of the superconducting state in the high - temperature superconducting materials is that of @xmath0-wave .",
    "given this situation , it seems worthwhile to explore the phenomenological implications of such a state , even if the microscopic origin of the superconductivity has not yet been fully established . in particular , the following feature of the phenomenological theory of @xmath5-wave superconductors has attracted the attention of a number of workers . in the absence of any external agents ( e.g. , magnetic fields , surfaces , currents , etc . ) , the only component of the superconducting order parameter that has a non - zero mean equilibrium value is the component with @xmath0   symmetry , the other ( i.e. subsidiary ) components exhibiting equilibrium fluctuations around a mean value of zero .",
    "external forces can give rise to non - zero mean values of subsidiary components .",
    "interestingly , general symmetry considerations permit a coupling between the gradients of @xmath0   and of other components  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this means that _ any _ inhomogeneity in @xmath0  acts as a _ source _ of inhomogeneities in other components and , therefore , as a source of these components themselves .",
    "this mechanism has been exploited by a number of authors .",
    "notably , volovik  @xcite , followed by soininen et al .",
    "@xcite and other workers  @xcite , have predicted that the vortices in a @xmath5-wave superconductor should exhibit a rich structure , in which @xmath1- and @xmath5-components of the order parameter co - exist .",
    "furthermore , the surface regions of these superconductors are predicted to be in a mixed @xmath1-@xmath5state  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we pursue one further consequence of the gradient coupling mechanism , viz . , we predict that an external current can induce non - zero subsidiary components of the superconducting order parameter via the ( current - induced ) inhomogeneity of the dominant ( i.e.  @xmath0 ) component . as opposed to the cases of vortices  @xcite and surfaces  @xcite , which both have an _ amplitude _ variation of the dominant ( @xmath0 ) component , the induction of subsidiary components by the current requires only its _ phase _ variation . in section  ii",
    ", we present the ginzburg - landau theory of the current - induced @xmath1-component in a @xmath5-wave superconductor .",
    "our treatment is based on the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory for a @xmath5-wave superconductor  @xcite that incorporates the effects of @xmath6-coupling . as it is not yet clear which of the subsidiary components has the strongest coupling to the @xmath0  -component , we then ( in section iii ) extend this treatment to include subsidiary irreducible representations of the tetragonal ( @xmath7 ) symmetry group other than @xmath1-wave .",
    "finally , we discuss some experimental settings in which current - induced subsidiary components of the order parameter might be observable .",
    "first we focus on the case of @xmath1/@xmath0  -coupling , in which the order parameter has two spatially varying complex components @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we neglect the magnetic fields induced by the current  @xcite .",
    "the gl equations for @xmath5- and @xmath1-components were derived in refs .",
    "@xcite ; they are    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the current density is given by @xmath14 where we have chosen the effective charge @xmath15 to be twice the electron charge .",
    "the parameters of the gl equations ( [ eq : gld],[eq : gls ] ) are chosen in such a way  @xcite that , in the absence of the current , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the presence of the current ,",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is nonzero but small compared with @xmath5 and , therefore , can be analyzed perturbatively . in this way , the inhomogeneity in @xmath5 acts as a source for @xmath1 . to the zeroth order in perturbation theory , we have @xmath18 the amplitude @xmath19 and the wave vector @xmath20 are found in the usual way  @xcite from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gld],[eq : j ] ) with @xmath1 having been set to zero :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the dimensionless @xmath5-wave order parameter normalized by its equilibrium value , @xmath23 is the correlation length of the @xmath5-wave order parameter , and @xmath24 is the critical current density . the dependence of @xmath25 , and thus of @xmath19 , on @xmath26 is given by the implicit relation ( [ eq : j ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath27 for @xmath28 , and @xmath25 approaches the value of @xmath29 from above as @xmath26 approaches @xmath30 from below ; for @xmath31 we have @xmath32 .",
    "to first order in perturbation theory , @xmath1 acquires a non - zero value and @xmath5 changes from its zeroth - order value .",
    "this also leads to a change in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) , which determines the wave vector of the order parameter for a given current density .",
    "this means that at this order the wave vector found in the previous order is changed .",
    "thus the appropriate _ ansatz _ at first order is    @xmath33    where quantities with the subscript @xmath30 are small compared to those with the subscript @xmath34 .",
    "as can be readily checked , this _ ansatz _ satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gld],[eq : gls],[eq : j ] ) . keeping only terms linear in @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and after some lengthy but straightforward algebra  @xcite",
    ", we obtain : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the angle between @xmath40 and the @xmath41-axis in the @xmath3-@xmath4plane .",
    "already at this stage two conclusions can be made .",
    "first , the amplitude of the induced @xmath1-component depends not only on the _ amplitude _ but also on the _ direction _ of the current : @xmath42 is maximal for a current flowing along the major crystallographic axes ( i.e. , for @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) and is zero ( at this order of perturbation theory ) for a current flowing along the diagonal of the unit cell ( i.e. , for @xmath45 ) .",
    "second , the rather cumbersome expression ( [ eq : gls1 ] ) is simplified considerably for temperatures @xmath46 very close to the critical temperature @xmath47 ( i.e. , in the critical regime , when the gl approach is strictly valid ) . in the limit @xmath48 all the terms in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gls1 ] ) that contain @xmath49 become small because @xmath50 diverges , and the last term in the denominator is small because @xmath19 is small . on the other hand , as @xmath47 is not a critical temperature for the @xmath1-wave component , @xmath51 is nonzero in this limit ; thus @xmath51 dominates the denominator .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : gls1 ] ) then takes on the simpler form : @xmath52 equation  ( [ eq : gls1simp ] ) shows that for generic values of the parameters , i.e. , for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the smallness of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath19 , and thus the validity of the perturbation theory , is guaranteed by the smallness of the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , in the critical region , the perturbation theory is valid even for currents that are not small compared to @xmath56 ( i.e. , for values of @xmath25 that are not close to @xmath30 ) . in order to obtain ( semi-)quantitative estimates for the amplitude of the induced @xmath1-wave order parameter as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gls1 ] ) , we need to know the values of the phenomenological parameters of the gl theory .",
    "these can be estimated , e.g. , by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gld ] , [ eq : gls],[eq : j ] ) with the gl equations that were derived recently by ren et al .",
    "@xcite from the gorkov equations for a particular microscopic model of pairing interactions  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite gives the following ratios of the phenomenological gl parameters :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the bcs coupling constant in the @xmath5-wave channel , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are interaction parameters , which in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite describe nearest - neighbor attraction and on - site repulsion , respectively . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1-wave component is induced by inhomogeneities in the @xmath5-wave component even if @xmath61 . for lack of better information about @xmath60",
    ", we set it to zero , which does not significantly affect our results . by using the ratios of the gl parameters given above , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gls1 ] ) is cast into the following form : @xmath62 to estimate the bcs coupling constant @xmath58 , we use the result of monthoux and pines  @xcite , who find that , in a spin - fluctuation model , the value of @xmath63k is obtained for @xmath58 close to @xmath30 ( the precise value depending on the doping ) . solely for illustrative purposes",
    ", we use the value @xmath64 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath26 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_vs_j ] for three values of @xmath66 .",
    "for the values @xmath67 and @xmath68 the result given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1micro ] ) is very close to that given by its simplified version eq .",
    "( [ eq : gls1simp ] ) . for @xmath69",
    "the result given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1micro ] ) is approximately one half of that given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gls1simp ] ) . at temperatures far below @xmath47 ( i.e. for @xmath70 ) , the microscopic derivation of the gl parameters leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1micro ] ) is not strictly valid , and the term @xmath71 is expected to be replaced by @xmath72 ( note that @xmath73 for @xmath74 ) , thus avoiding the apparent singular behavior in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1micro ] ) .    the presence of the @xmath1-wave component , which according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pt1d],[eq : pt1s ] ) is in - phase with the @xmath5-wave component , implies that excitations with momentum along the @xmath75 directions are no longer gapless .",
    "rather , they have the energy gap given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the maximum value of the @xmath5-wave gap in the absence of the currents . the lines of nodes , oriented along the @xmath75 directions in the absence of current , are now rotated by the angle @xmath78 [ see figs .",
    "( [ fig : d+s+a]a , b ) ] .",
    "the @xmath79-space structure of the order parameter undergoes an _ orthorhombic distortion _ , i.e. , the current - induced s - wave component mimics the effect of having an orthorhombic ( rather than tetragonal ) lattice and no supercurrent . by using the typical value of @xmath80k , we see , e.g. , that for @xmath69 ( i.e. , for @xmath81 ) and for @xmath82 the gap @xmath83k , and the lines of nodes rotate by @xmath84 .",
    "we must emphasize that at lower temperatures ( i.e. , when @xmath85 ) and for currents comparable to the critical current , there is no longer a natural small parameter in the theory that would automatically guarantee the smallness of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath19 . the fact that @xmath36 remains small even in this region is due to the particular choice of the ratios of the gl parameters .",
    "however , the gl theory is not expected to be quantitatively correct in this region , so the microscopic theory might give other numerical values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the absence of a natural small parameter suggests that these values might be larger than those given by the perturbative treatment of the gl equations .",
    "so far , we have considered the coupling of the dominant @xmath0-component to the ( subsidiary ) @xmath1-wave component , which is taken as the main subsidiary component in the microscopic approaches of  @xcite . in general , the gl theory should incorporate all irreducible representations of the @xmath7 symmetry group ; it is then the task of a microscopic theory to determine the dominant , and leading subdominant , components .",
    "although the growing consensus is that the leading component corresponds to the @xmath0  representation , it is not clear , at present , which representation describes the subleading component  @xcite . therefore , we now extend the treatment presented above to include couplings between the @xmath0  component and components of the order parameter other than @xmath1-wave .",
    "the irreducible representations of the ( planar ) @xmath7 group are ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath88 or @xmath1-wave ( transforming as @xmath89 ) , @xmath90 [ transforming as @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath0-wave ( transforming as @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 ( transforming as @xmath95 ) , and @xmath96 ( transforming as the two - component vector @xmath97 ) .",
    "( these representations are also commonly denoted @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively . ) note that @xmath96 is a two - dimensional representation , whereas the other representations are one - dimensional .",
    "we now focus on the determination of the terms in the gl free energy describing the couplings between the gradients of @xmath92 ( @xmath0 ) and of other representations .",
    "we consider only the leading terms of this type , i.e. , terms of the form : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the component of the order parameter transforming according to representation @xmath102 . here , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "these terms transform as the ( reducible ) representation @xmath105 . as each term in the free energy",
    "must transform as a scalar , the _ maximum _ number of such gradient - coupling terms is given by the number @xmath106 of times the identity ( @xmath88 ) representation occurs in the decomposition of @xmath107 into the irreducible representations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath106 is given by the normalized product of characters corresponding to irreducible representations @xmath92 and @xmath102 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this gives : @xmath108 for @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "first , we consider the case @xmath111 .",
    "a term satisfying all the symmetries of the group @xmath7 can be written as @xmath112 and , as @xmath113 , there are no further independent terms  @xcite .",
    "next , we consider @xmath114 . the symmetry @xmath115 imposes the conditions : @xmath116 and @xmath117 , while , e.g. , the symmetry @xmath118 requires that @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , all the constants are zero and there no are gradient - coupling terms to leading order for @xmath114 . the analysis of cases @xmath120 has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gld ] , [ eq : gls ] ) , and @xmath121 is zero .",
    "thus , the only case for which the induction of the subsidiary component of the order parameter by the current remains to be considered is that of the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath90-representation [ the latter is henceforth being referred to as @xmath2 ] .",
    "we denote the component of the order parameter corresponding to the @xmath2  -representation by @xmath123 . in order to construct the gl free energy for the case of @xmath2-@xmath0 coupling",
    ", we : ( i )  note that the structure of terms other then the mixed gradient terms is the same as for the case of the @xmath1/@xmath0  coupling ; and ( ii )  make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : grad23 ] ) for the mixed gradient term . the usual variational procedure",
    "then leads to the following gl equations for @xmath5 and @xmath3 :    @xmath124    where @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the current density takes the form @xmath127 [ as the two last terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ja ] ) come from the variation of the ( covariant ) mixed gradient terms in the free energy with respect to the vector - potential , their structure is different from that of the analogous terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) ] . as in the case of @xmath1/@xmath0  -coupling , we assume that the amplitude of @xmath3 induced by the current is small compared to @xmath5 .",
    "the first - order perturbative calculation analogous to that for the case of the @xmath1/@xmath0   -coupling leads to the following result for the induced @xmath2   -component @xmath128 : @xmath129 we see that in contrast to the case of the @xmath1/@xmath0  -coupling [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : gls1 ] ) ] , the induced @xmath2- component is zero for currents flowing along the principal crystallographic axes in the @xmath130 plane ( i.e. , for @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) and reaches its maximum absolute value for currents flowing along the diagonal of the unit cell ( i.  e. , for @xmath45 ) .",
    "this difference could be used in an experiment to determine which of the two couplings ( i.e. , @xmath131 or @xmath2/@xmath0 ) is realized in a given hts material . in the critical region ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath48 , the term @xmath132 dominates the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gla1 ] ) , due to the reasons described in the discussion of the @xmath1/@xmath0   -coupling , and eq .
