    "materials with a coexistence of magnetic and electric long - range order , called multiferroics , exhibit a variety of remarkable magnetoelectric cross - coupling phenomena .",
    "ferroelectric phase transitions driven by magnetic fields and magnetic phase transitions stimulated by electric fields are among the most spectacular examples . a particularly rigid coupling between magnetic and dielectric properties is obtained in multiferroics where the magnetic order induces an improper ferroelectric polarization @xcite .",
    "such magnetically induced ferroelectrics represent an outstanding class of multiferroics because they combine two desirable aspects : ( i ) a unique control of spin - based properties by electric fields , and ( ii ) a matchless versatility regarding intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms .",
    "prototypical examples are tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 , tbmno@xmath7 , and cucro@xmath0 in which the spontaneous polarization is attributed to magnetostrictive ( exchange - symmetric ) , dzyaloshinskii - moriya - type ( exchange - antisymmetric ) , and orbital interactions , respectively @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of the magnetically induced ferroelectrics is their complexity .",
    "various mechanisms , demanding in themselves , cooperate for promoting the spontaneous polarization : geometric frustration , incommensurate spin order , low crystallographic symmetry , and electronic @xmath8 interactions may all play a role .",
    "this inevitably results in rich magnetoelectric phase diagrams with a multiplicity of contributions to the ferroelectric polarization @xmath9 .",
    "the situation culminates in compounds like tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 which hosts three magnetic subsystems and five different magnetically ordered phases .",
    "this leads to a complex temperature- and field - dependence of the magnetically induced polarization , including a sign change of @xmath9 induced by a moderate magnetic field @xcite .",
    "phenomenological two- and three - polarization models were proposed to explain such features and the @xmath8 interplay of the manganese and the terbium sublattices was scrutinized @xcite . however , up to now an explicit disentanglement of individual contributions to the net polarization has not been accomplished because pyroelectric current measurements , the standard technique for measuring values in the order of 1  nc/@xmath10 , can only reveal the spatially integrated net polarization .",
    "however , a unique experimental separation of the polarization contributions and their respective magnetic - field dependence would be highly valuable for identifying the origin of magnetoelectric phase control in compounds like tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 .    here",
    "we report that the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 is composed of _ three _ independent contributions .",
    "two of these are related to the magnetic order of the mn@xmath2 ions while the third contribution originates in the antiferromagnetic tb@xmath5 order , possibly involving isotropic exchange and o@xmath6 spin polarization by the rare - earth order .",
    "we show that the magnetic - field - induced change of sign of the polarization in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 is dominated by the field - induced suppression of the tb@xmath5-related polarization contribution ( by to field - induced quenching of the rare - earth order ) and the emergence of an oppositely polarized contribution ( related to the quadratic magnetoelectric effect ) .",

    "the shg data reveal further clues about the microscopic origin of @xmath44 : on the one hand , shg probes the @xmath133 charge - transfer excitation @xcite and can thus be sensitive to the magnetic mn@xmath2 order and the related polarization @xmath85 . on the other hand , shg couples to the tb@xmath5-related polarization @xmath44 although optical tb@xmath5 excitations are not present in the range where the shg data were taken .",
    "this relates @xmath44 to an exchange interaction between the tb@xmath5 and the mn@xmath2 spins .",
    "however the shg data _ do not _ simply reproduce the magnetic moment exerted onto the mn@xmath2 ions by the ordered tb@xmath5 spins , as this would also affect @xmath65 and @xmath38 .",

    "they are insensitive to a magnetic field @xmath3 of up to @xmath4  t within 1% of the maximal polarization value . the third contribution , @xmath44 ,",
    "is induced by the afm long - range order of the tb@xmath5 moments , as deduced from the observed temperature and magnetic - field dependence of @xmath134 .",
