    "khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) observed in neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns lmxbs ) will give an important clue to understand the innermost structure of relativistic disks of ns lmxbs , if their origin is clarified .",
    "so far , many models of khz qpos are proposed . among them",
    "trapped disk oscillations are one of promising candidates , and trapping of p- , g- , and c- mode oscillations in relativistic disks has been extensively studied ( see wagoner 1999 , kato 2001 , and kato et al .",
    "2008 for review , and see fu & lai 2009 and lai & tiang 2009 for related topics ) .",
    "in addition to the above trapped oscillations , kato ( 2010 , 2011a , b , 2012a , b ) suggested that trapped , two - armed ( @xmath0 ) , vertical p - mode oscillations in geometrically thin ( magnetized ) disks are one of possible origins of khz qpos observed in neutron - star x - ray sources . in this model two trapped oscillations , both of which are fundamental modes ( @xmath1 ) in the vertical direction but one is the fundamental ( @xmath5 ) and the other the first overtone ( @xmath6 ) in the radial direction , are regarded to be the twin khz qpos .",
    "frequencies of these two oscillations change with correlation by time changes of disk temperature , disk vertical thickness and toroidal magnetic fields in disks .",
    "this correlated change of the frequencies is considered to be the cause of the observed correlated change of the twin khz qpos ( kato 2011b , 2012b ) .    in calculating the frequencies of",
    "trapped , two - armed p - mode oscillations , we have assumed that the disks are isothermal in the vertical direction and have toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , the toroidal magnetic fields are assumed to be distributed in the vertical direction so that the alfv ' en speed , @xmath7 , is constant in the vertical direction ( kato 2011a , 2012a ) . even in this simplified case ,",
    "semi - analytical calculations of frequencies of trapped vertical p - mode oscillation are still complicated .",
    "hence , in previous studies ( kato 2011a , 2012a ) we have assumed that the oscillations are nearly vertical and the motions in the radial direction associated with the oscillations can be treated as small perturbations over the vertical motions .",
    "the approximation is allowed in qualitative arguments , but not accurate enough to do quantitative comparison of our model with observations .",
    "hence , in this paper , returning to a simpler case , i.e. , to the case of non - magnetized disks , we examine the trapping of two - armed vertical p - mode oscillations , since in this simpler case the frequencies of trapped oscillations can be calculated analytically without introducing the approximation that the oscillations are nearly vertical .",
    "the results show that even in this case of non - magnetized disks , the observed correlation of twin khz qpos and the correlation between khz qpos and horizontal branch oscillation can be both described by moderate time variations of disk temperature , if the disks are strongly truncated in the vertical thickness .",
    "distinct from previous papers by kato ( 2011a , b , 2012a , b ) , no magnetic field is assumed in this paper . except for this ,",
    "our disk models are the same as those adopted in previous papers .",
    "that is , the unperturbed axisymmetric disks are vertically isothermal .",
    "thus , the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium gives that in the vertical direction the density @xmath8 is distributed as @xmath9 where the scale height @xmath10 is related to the isothermal accoustic speed @xmath11 and the vertical epicyclic frequency @xmath12 by @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the radial coordinate of the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16 ) whose @xmath16-axis is perpendicular to the unperturbed disk plane and the origin is at the disk center . it is noted that the newtonian formulation is adopted in this paper , except when the radial distributions of @xmath17 , @xmath12 , and @xmath18 are considered , where @xmath18 is the radial epicyclic frequency and @xmath17 is the angular velocity of disk rotation and taken to be the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath19 , since geometrically thin disks are considered .",
    "we assume that the isothermal disks are terminated at a certain height and surrounded by hot , low - density corona .",
    "the height of termination , @xmath20 , is taken to be a free parameter .",
    "hereafter , we introduce a dimensionless parameter , @xmath21 , defined by @xmath22 , which is a function of @xmath14 in general , but taken to be a constant independent of @xmath14 , since the trapped region of oscillations is not wide , except for the case of small @xmath21 , as is shown below ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the disk temperature is also a parameter describing disks . as a reference",
    ", we adopt the temperature in the standard disks where the gas pressure dominates over the radiation pressure and the opacity comes from the free - free processes . in this case , if the conventional viscosity parameter @xmath23 is 0.1 and the mass accretion rate normalized by the eddington critical accretion rate is 0.3 , the square of the isothermal accoustic speed , @xmath24 , is given by ( e.g. , kato et al .",
    "2008 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of the central source and @xmath27 is the schwarzschild radius defined by @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath29 $ ] as a dimensionless parameter describing the temperature distribution in disks .",
    "@xmath30 is , in general , a function of @xmath14 , but taken to be constant independent of @xmath14 , since the trapped region of oscillations is generally not wide , as mentioned before .    in summary",
    ", we specify our disk models by two parameters : @xmath31 and two additional parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath33 is the spin parameter of the central source ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "wave equations describing isothermal oscillations in vertically isothermal and geometrically thin disks have been well studied ( e.g. , kato 2001 for review ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the variable @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the pressure variation over the unperturbed pressure @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the unperturbed density .",
    "then , under the approximation that the radial wavelength of the perturbations is smaller than the scale length of the radial variations of the equilibrium properties of the disk , we have a wave equation in terms of @xmath35 as ( e.g. , kato 2001 ) @xmath40          + \\frac{(\\omega - m\\omega)^2}{c_{\\rm s}^2}h_1=0 , \\label{3.1}\\ ] ] where the perturbations are taken to be proportional to exp@xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are being , respectively , the frequency and the azimuthal wavenumber of perturbations . in this paper",

    "the trapping condition ( [ 3.8 ] ) determines the frequency and the capture radius which are shown in figure 2 by thick horizontal lines .",

    "we suppose that the same situation occurs even in magnetized disks .",
    "that is , if we could calculate the correlation curves without the approximation in the case of magnetized disks , they will shift in the left - downward direction along the curve derived in paper i. this means that the same correlation range on the diagram can be derived by smaller values of @xmath30 and @xmath133 , if frequencies coud be calculated without the approximation .",
    "in other words , such strong magnetic fields required in paper i may be unnecessary , if we could derive and solve wave equations in magnetized disks without the approximation .",
    "this is in favor of our model , since the magnetic fields required in paper i seem to be somewhat stronger than those usually supposed in accretion disks .",
    "next , we examine whether the ( 2,0 ) oscillation can be regarded as the horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) .",
    "figure 8 shows that in non - magnetized disks the frequency correlation between the ( 1,0 ) and ( 2,0 ) oscillations is close to the observed correlation between the upper khz qpo and hbo , if @xmath21 is taken to be as small as @xmath128 .",
    "this suggests that the disks of horizontal branch phase of z - sources are strongly diminished in their vertical thickness .    concerning the disks of the horizontal branch , we considered in paper i two possibilities : the sequence of horizontal branch is i ) a sequence of change of toroidal magnetic fields ( figure 9 of paper i ) or ii ) a sequence of change of disk temperature with moderate or strong toroidal magnetic fields ( figure 10 of paper i ) .",
    "the first possibility seems to be less promising , since the correlation curve calculated in paper i has a sharper gradient on the frequency - frequency diagram , compared with the curve of observations ( see figure 9 of paper i ) .",

    "hence , the correlation curve calculated by changing the strength of toroidal magnetic fields has a sharp gradient on the frequency - frequency diagram .",
    "this situation will not be much changed , even if we could calculate the frequency of trapped ( 2,0 ) oscillations in magnetized disks without using the approximation of nearly vertical oscillation .",
    "compared with this , the correlation curve obtained by changing the disk temperature can better describe the observational correlation curve . in the limit of no magnetic fields",
    "the calculated curve is roughly parallel to the observed correlation curve on the frequency  frequency diagram and moves downward on the diagram as @xmath21 decreases ( see figure 8) .",
    "if toroidal magnetic fields are present ( @xmath136 being taken to be constant during temperature change ) , the correlation curve calculated will move downward furthermore compared with the case of no magnetic field , since an increase of @xmath136 will have a similar effect to a decrease of @xmath21 [ see equation @xmath134^{1/2 } \\omega_\\bot$ ] ] .",
    "increases @xmath69 , while an increase of @xmath136 increases @xmath135 .",
    "hence , both have similar effects on frequency @xmath42 . ]",
    "this suggests that the observed correlation curve will be described by @xmath21 larger than @xmath128 , when there are toroidal magnetic fields of moderate strength with @xmath138 const .",
    "the correlation curve shown in figure 10 of paper i will be also consistent with this argument , since the correlation curve in the figure will shift in the right - downward direction if we could calculate the correlation curve without using the approximation of nearly vertical oscillations .",
    "the above argument suggests that the horizontal branch of z - sources is a sequence of temperature change in disks whose vertical thickness is strongly diminished .",
    "the direction of temperature increase is from right to left on the horizontal branch , since the direction of decrease of observed qpo frequencies is from right to left on the branch .",
    "the temperature change will be a result of a change of mass accretion rate .",
    "thus , this disk model of the z - branch is similar to and support the disk model proposed by church et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bolucinska - church et al .",
    "( 2010 ) from spectral analyses , although the origins of qpos are different .",
    "one of possible causes why the disks of horizontal branch are vertically thin will be strong radiation from the central source resulting from high mass accretion and disk evaporation toward the corona , as church et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bolucinska - church et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argue . if moderately strong toroidal magnetic fields are present in disks",
    ", it will be in favor of our model of qpos , although only the limiting case of no magnetic fields is examined in this paper .",
    "it is noted here that disks with strong magnetic fields ( the plasma @xmath30 being less than unity and as small as 0.1 ) are expected at a stage of transition from optically thin flows ( adafs ) to optically thick disks by increase of mass accretion rate ( machida et al .",
    "2006 , oda et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 , 2010 ) , although the horizontal branch of z - sources is different from such stage .",
    "it should be emphasized that in our model of khz qpos the correlation curve between the ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) oscillations moves almost along a common curve on the frequency - frequency diagram for changes of disk parameters , as far as the mass and spin of the central source are fixed . on the other hand , the correlation curve between the ( 1,0 ) and ( 2,0 ) oscillations are rather sensitive to the disk parameters such as @xmath21 .",
    "the former is in favor of our model , since the common curve mentioned above can well describe the observed correlation curve for reasonable mass and spin parameter of the central source .",
    "however , the latter has two sides for and against our model .",
    "if our model is correct , it is a good tool to determine the disk structure of horizontal branch of z - sources .",
    "it is , however , unclear why disk thickness ( and magnetic fields ) in real disks is really adjusted to values relevant to describe observations .    in our model the radius of the inner edge of disks",
    "is assumed to be unchanged during the disk evolution along the sequence .",
    "it is unclear at the present stage of our model whether time change of the inner edge of disks is required to describe the observed correlation curve by our model .",
    "the observed amplitude of hbos is much larger than that of khz qpos .",
    "whether this can be described by our model is a subject to be discussed further .",
    "one of possibilities will be the difference of width of the trapped regions . in our model",
    ", the trapped region of the ( 1,0 ) oscillation is only in the innermost region , but that of the ( 2,0 ) oscillation is wide when @xmath21 is small ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this difference will be one of causes of amplitude difference between khz qpos and hbos .",
    "it is noted that the trapped region of the ( 1,1 ) oscillation is also wide ( see figure 2 ) , but in this case the oscillation has one wavelength in the trapped region .",
    "hence , by a cancellation by phase mixing the observed amplitude will not become large .",
    "it is also noted that a wide trapped region implies that our basic approximation that @xmath139 and @xmath30 are constant in the trapped region will not always be relevant .",
    "radial variations of @xmath139 and @xmath30 should be taken into account to do more detailed comparison with observations .      in a previous paper ( kato 2012a )",
    ", we have examined the effects of toroidal magnetic fields on frequencies of trapped oscillations in truncated disks . in the study",
    "we have introduced an approximation that the vertical p - mode oscillations consist of nearly vertical motions and thus the horizontal motions associated with them can be taken to be small perturbations over the vertical ones . under this approximation ,",
    "in addition to the wkb approximation , we obtained an equation describing the frequencies of trapped oscillations [ see equations ( 39 ) , ( 41 ) , and ( 44 ) in kato ( 2012a ) ] @xmath140^{1/2}}{\\omega_\\bot h }             \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/2}}{a_{n,{\\rm s}}^{1/2}}dr              = \\pi \\biggr(n_{\\rm r}+\\frac{3}{4}\\biggr ) , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is a dimensionless quantity given by equation ( 37 ) in kato ( 2012a ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath142 is a dimensionless quantity defined by [ see equations ( 12 ) and ( 17 ) in kato ( 2012a ) ] @xmath143 and is assumed to be @xmath144 ( kato 2012a ) .    since in the case of no magnetic fields ( @xmath145 )",
    ", @xmath141 is reduced to @xmath146 equation ( [ a1 ] ) can be written as @xmath147^{1/2}}{c_{\\rm s } }            \\biggr[\\frac{(\\omega - m\\omega)^2-{\\tilde k}_{n,{\\rm s}}\\omega_\\bot^2 }            { { \\tilde k}_{n,{\\rm s}}\\omega_\\bot^2}\\biggr]^{1/2}dr            = \\pi\\biggr(n_{\\rm r}+\\frac{3}{4}\\biggr ) .",
    "\\label{a4}\\ ] ] this is the equation corresponding to equation ( [ 3.8 ] ) in this paper , which is @xmath147^{1/2}}{c_{\\rm s } }      \\biggr[\\frac{(\\omega - m\\omega)^2-{\\tilde k}_{n,{\\rm s}}\\omega_\\bot^2 }            { ( \\omega - m\\omega)^2}\\biggr]^{1/2}dr            = \\pi\\biggr(n_{\\rm r}+\\frac{3}{4}\\biggr )",
    ". \\label{a5}\\ ] ] this means that the perturbation method adopted by kato ( 2012a ) is valid only when in the propagation region of oscillations we have @xmath148 or @xmath149 this is nothing but the condition of @xmath144 , as is expected .    in the case of two armed oscillations , @xmath0 , with @xmath1",
    ", we have @xmath109 .",
    "hence , this condition is realized when @xmath42 is comparable with @xmath150 . in oscillations with @xmath115 , @xmath151 in disks with @xmath53 and @xmath152 in the disks terminated in the vertical thickness ( see table 1 ) .",
    "hence , this approximation is valid when @xmath42 is moderately smaller than @xmath150 as is shown in figure 1 ."
