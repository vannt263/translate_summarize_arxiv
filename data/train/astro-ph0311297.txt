    "m82 ( ngc 3034 ) is often considered the archetypical starburst galaxy since it has a derived star formation rate ( @xmath110 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ; @xcite ) that would deplete the observed molecular gas in @xmath4 10@xmath5 yrs ( i.e. short on a hubble timescale ; @xcite ) .",
    "the starburst phenomena traces recent star formation since it is the massive stars ( @xmath68 m@xmath2 ) , which have short lives , that dominate the energetic output of the host galaxy .",
    "the nuclear starburst of m82 dominates the infrared ( ir ) luminosity of the galaxy - essentially all of the galaxy s l@xmath7 3.6 @xmath8 10@xmath9 l@xmath2 = l(1 - 300@xmath0 ) = 3.0 @xmath8 10@xmath9 l@xmath2 assuming a distance to m82 of 3.3 mpc .",
    "we have updated l@xmath10 for the distance of 3.6 mpc @xcite used in this paper .",
    "] comes from the central kpc @xcite .",
    "optical and near - ir imaging of m82 has revealed numerous super - star clusters in its active star - forming nucleus .",
    "ground - based optical imaging of the central region detected eight young knots distributed throughout the region @xcite .",
    "further study of these knots broke them into smaller star clusters ( half light diameters @xmath13 - 4 pc ) and suggested cluster dynamical masses 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "m82 s current starburst is thought to have been triggered by its interaction with m81 @xmath110@xmath5 yrs ago @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the conditions resulting from interactions and mergers of galaxies are favorable for globular cluster formation ( eg . @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "uv studies of global properties of starbursting galaxies have shown that as much as 20% of the light is produced in the luminous knots @xcite , suggesting a high efficiency of cluster formation in starbursts .",
    "understanding the star formation occurring in m82 s nuclear region can provide insight into both the general process of star formation in starburst environments and also the process and efficiency of forming super - star clusters .",
    "the nearly edge - on geometry of m82 combined with heavy optical extinction ( a@xmath13 5 - 25 mag ; @xcite ) has made the galaxy s central 400 pc difficult to study . even in the near - ir where a@xmath14 1/10a@xmath15 @xcite , it is difficult to directly measure the deepest star forming regions .",
    "the mid - ir region of the spectrum is essential for probing deep into the central regions of m82 and revealing the details of the intense star formation occurring in the central regions .",
    "previously , the highest resolution mid - ir map of the central region of m82 was a 12.4 @xmath0 map by @xcite , which had a resolution @xmath11.1@xmath16 .",
    "mid - ir maps of m82 with lower resolution have also been published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in this paper , we improve upon previous observations by presenting higher resolution mid - ir maps of m82 . we discuss evidence suggesting the sources in the maps are young counterparts to globular clusters and estimate the efficiency of super - star cluster formation in m82 .",
    "on 2003 april 23 , we imaged m82 at 3.5 ( l - band ) , 11.7 , and 17.65 @xmath0 with the long wavelength spectrograph ( lws ; @xcite ) , a facility instrument at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory .",
    "lws uses a 128 @xmath8 128 pixel boeing si : as detector and has a plate scale of 0@xmath1708 pixel@xmath3 , resulting in a 10@xmath172 @xmath8 10@xmath172 field of view .",
    "we used the `` chop - nod '' mode of observing , with a chop throw of 15@xmath16 north .",
    "the bad pixels in the images have been smoothed over , and a mask has been applied to remove the portion of the chip not illuminated by the source .",
    "the seeing varied during the course of the observations so the resolution in individual frames ranged from 0.4 - 1.0@xmath16 at 11.7 @xmath0 and from 0.5 - 0.7@xmath16 at 17.65 @xmath0 . at each of seven pointings across m82 s nuclear region , we imaged at all three wavelengths before moving to the next pointing .",
    "images from the seven pointings were mosaiced by centroiding on the bright sources in each frame . assigning coordinates to the field",
    "was accomplished by aligning 2mass sources with the centroids of the two bright sources in the l - band frames .",
    "we estimate that our positions are accurate to @xmath10@xmath175 .",
    "the star @xmath18 uma was used as the primary standard for flux density and point - spread function calibration , and @xmath19 her and @xmath20 sgr were used to estimate a calibration error of @xmath1 20% .",
    "our mid - ir maps , presented as figures 1 and 2 , contain several bright , resolved sources as well as diffuse emission connecting the brighter sources .",
    "the mid - ir sources , labeled a - g from west to east , are denoted by black circles ( with radii 0@xmath175 , corresponding to the positional error ) . for reference ,",
    "the 2 @xmath0 peak is marked in the figures as a yellow cross @xcite and the dynamical center measured by @xcite is marked with a yellow circle .",
    "the sharp edges visible in the maps ( eg . southeast of source b in the 11.7 @xmath0 map )",
    "are artifacts that resulted from the mosaicing of images with differing thermal backgrounds and do not affect the results of this paper .",
    "the earlier , lower resolution 12.4 @xmath0 map by @xcite contained two bright regions , one to either side of the galaxy s center .",
    "the overall structure in our higher resolution maps is comparable , though we identify individual resolved sources within the telesco & gezari sources . to compare their flux densities with those previously published",
    ", telesco & gezari reported a flux of 6.5 @xmath21 0.7 jy at 12.4 @xmath0 for the 4@xmath22 4@xmath16 region containing our sources c and d. we measure a flux for the same region of 5.3 @xmath21 1.3 jy at 11.7 @xmath0 , in agreement with the previous observation .",
    "the flux densities and half intensity major and minor axes measured from the maps for the mid - ir sources are listed in table 1 . for sources covered by more than one image ,",
    "photometry was performed on each image individually and the average of the measurements is presented here . the standard deviation of the measurements due to background variations was @xmath23 15% and , combined quadratically with the calibration error , results in an overall flux density error of @xmath23 25% in our measurements .",
    "using our 11.7 @xmath0 and 17.65 @xmath0 flux densities , we estimate the color temperature of the mid - ir emitting dust to be in the range 150 - 270 k , assuming the dust particles radiate as blackbodies . the mid - ir luminosities ( l@xmath24 l@xmath25 ) of the sources , estimated by fitting the measured flux densities to a blackbody with the color temperatures for each source , are all between 0.2 - 6 @xmath8 10@xmath26 l@xmath2 and sum to 2.4 @xmath8 10@xmath27 l@xmath2 .",
    "l@xmath28 for the entire galaxy estimated using the same procedure with the uncorrected iras 12 and 25 @xmath0 flux densities of 53 jy and 274 jy , respectively , gives 1.7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 l@xmath2 , thus the seven mid - ir sources contribute @xmath115% of m82 s total l@xmath28 .",
    "using radio images at five frequencies , @xcite created spectrally decomposed images of thermal ( free - free ) and non - thermal ( synchrotron ) emission .",
    "we find that not only do all the centers of the thermal h ii regions ( marked in figures 1 & 2 with red squares ) match the centers of the mid - ir sources reasonably well , the diffuse structure in the mid - ir maps follows closely the structure in the thermal free - free map .",
    "@xcite also noted the correspondence of the diffuse 1.5 & 22 ghz emission with the @xcite 12.4 @xmath0 emission .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the mid - ir sources are heavily obscured h ii regions .",
    "the [ ne ii ] ( 12.8 @xmath0 ) map published by @xcite , with a resolution of @xmath11@xmath16 , also correlates well with our mid - ir maps ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "it should be noted that while the peak of the [ ne ii ] line lies within our 11.7 @xmath0 filter bandpass ( @xmath29 = 2.4 ) , based on the 5 - 16.5 @xmath0 spectra presented in @xcite , the [ ne ii ] line contributes @xmath2315% of the flux in our bandpass .",
    "we interpret the correlation between the mid - ir and the [ ne ii ] emission as confirmation that the source of the mid - ir emission is dust heated by uv from young stars which ionize ne i. further evidence to support this hypothesis comes from the br@xmath30 map from @xcite . though not covering the entire mid - ir field , the br@xmath30 emission observed is",
    "also well correlated with the mid - ir emission .",
    "both emission line maps agree with the mid - ir map in the apparent lack of emission toward the dynamical center of m82 .",
    "non - thermal radio sources from @xcite and @xcite are shown in figures 1 & 2 as magenta crosses ; these are assumed to be supernova remnants since they have inverted radio spectra .",
    "we find no correlation between the radio supernova remnants and the mid - ir sources , but notice that most of the supernova remnants follow the outer edge of the mid - ir emission at a flux levels @xmath310.3 jy arcsec@xmath32 at 11.7 @xmath0 and @xmath310.7 jy arcsec@xmath32 at 17.65 @xmath0 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume a reference ob star luminosity of 2.5 @xmath8 10@xmath33 l@xmath2 for an o7 star @xcite to calculate the ob star content of each mid - ir source from its l@xmath28 .",
    "these values are listed in table 1 . for the brightest regions ( b , c , and g ) we find that @xmath12000 - 2500 o7 stars are required to generate the mid - ir luminosity . @xcite",
    "derived comparable numbers of ob stars for regions near sources b and c ( 3200 and 4400 o7 stars , respectively ) using he i / br@xmath30 line ratios to estimate the lyman continuum flux from their regions .    since we find that the [ ne ii ] emission correlates spatially with the mid - ir emission , we use [ ne ii ] channel maps from @xcite , which have a resolution of 16 km s@xmath3 , to estimate velocity dispersions ( @xmath34 ) in the ionized gas of @xmath115 - 30 km s@xmath3 at the positions of the mid - ir sources .",
    "estimates of the velocity dispersions from the br@xmath30 @xcite and @xmath35co @xcite channel maps , each with lower velocity resolution , give similar results . a caveat to using ionized emission to estimate",
    "a velocity dispersion is that the ionized gas may well be accelerated by shocks , and therefore its velocity should be considered an upper limit to the stellar velocity .    from the range of",
    "estimated velocity dispersions and assuming virialized systems , we use @xmath36 , to calculate a range for the total mass in each these systems . in this formulation , g is the gravitational constant , @xmath37 is the projected half intensity radius defined to be the geometric mean of the semi - major and semi - minor axes , and @xmath20 = 10 @xcite",
    ". the mass ranges for each mid - ir source are listed in table 1 and should be considered upper limits since h ii regions are generally found to be freely expanding systems . for the largest sources , the mass range we find is 6 - 25 @xmath8 10@xmath12 m@xmath2 . in every case",
    ", the range contains the system mass found by extrapolating from the number of o7 stars using a salpeter mass function . comparing the sizes and masses of the star clusters forming in m82 to three of the largest galactic globular clusters , which have radii of 5 - 10 pc and masses 1 - 2 @xmath8 10@xmath12 m@xmath2 ( see table 1 ) , we conclude that the star clusters forming in the nuclear region of m82 are young analogs to globular clusters .",
    "the existence of present day globular cluster - sized knots of star formation is not unique to m82 .",
    "indeed , super - star clusters containing quantities of ob stars similar to those we find in m82 have been observed in a number of galaxies ( e.g. ncg 5253 , @xcite ; he 2 - 10 , @xcite ; ngc 4038/9 , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , two star forming regions in the milky way , the arches cluster near the galactic center and the cygnus ob2 association , are estimated to each weigh in at 6 @xmath8 10@xmath11 m@xmath2 @xcite , comparable to a small globular cluster @xcite .",
    "however , the arches cluster and cygnus ob2 each contain around 100 o stars , which contribute together only @xmath13% of the total galactic o stars @xcite , and yet far outnumber all other galactic star forming regions in their o star content .    in m82 ,",
    "the seven mid - ir sources in the nuclear region together contribute @xmath1 15% of the total l@xmath28 of the galaxy .",
    "the [ ne ii ] map suggests that there may be several h ii regions outside our mid - ir field which may contribute up to an additional @xmath15% to the total l@xmath10 . assuming all the mid - ir luminosity in m82 comes from star formation @xcite",
    ", it follows that @xmath3820% of m82 s star formation is in the form of super - star clusters - in contrast to the mere 3% in the milky way .",
    "this may be an important feature of starbursts in general ; not only do they provide an environment suitable for forming globular clusters , but the super - star cluster formation efficiency in starbursts is @xmath3820% .",
    "this paper presents mid - ir ( 11.7 and 17.65 @xmath0 ) maps with @xmath10.5@xmath16 resolution of the central 400 pc of the starbursting galaxy m82 .",
    "we find 7 resolved sources in this region of m82 with luminosities summing to 15% of the total iras flux of the entire galaxy .",
    "the mid - ir maps exhibit features comparable to those found in maps of [ ne ii ] emission , br@xmath30 emission , and thermal free - free emisson .",
    "we present evidence implying that the mid - ir sources are giant h ii regions in which globular cluster - sized star clusters are forming .",
    "our data imply that @xmath3820% of the star formation in m82 is occurring in super - star clusters .",
