    "w uma type binary systems are cool short - period binary systems in which both of its two components fill the critical roche lobes and share a common convective envelope .",
    "their ew - type light curves vary continuously and the depths of the primary and secondary minima are almost equal . it is found that about @xmath8 of the eclipsing binaries around the solar system are w uma type contact binary systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite divided the w uma type binary systems into two subclasses : a - subtype and w - subtype .",
    "the a - subtype w uma systems are also called early - type contact binaries with their spectral types usually earlier than f0 and the more massive stars are the hotter ones .",
    "the w - subtype systems are also called late type contact binaries with their spectral types to be f and g type or even later .",
    "the less massive components are the hotter ones in the w - subtype systems .",
    "the formation and evolutionary theories of contact binaries are still open issues .",
    "w uma type systems are very important targets in this research field .",
    "therefore , more and more fundamental information about w uma type systems , both photometric and spectroscopic analysis , are urgently needed .    , also named or ,",
    "is a newly discovered w uma type contact binary system detected in the field of view of v563 lyr .",
    "there is neither photometric solution nor spectroscopic observation about this target published before . in the present work , @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands light curves of are analyzed with the wilson - devinney ( w - d ) code for the first time .",
    "the basic physical parameters of this system is obtained and its formation and evolutionary scenario are figured out , which will improve our understanding on the w uma type binary systems .",
    "the ccd photometric observations of the eclipsing binary were carried out over 7 nights on september and october 2012 ( hjd 2456199 to hjd 2456207 ) using an sbig st-10xme ccd camera attached to the 0.4 m cassegrain reflecting telescope in the university of athens observatory , greece @xcite . during the observations , the broadband johnson - cousins @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 filters were used . was chosen as the comparison star .",
    "a total of 358 points in @xmath0 filter , 395 in @xmath1 filter , 383 in @xmath9 filter and 417 in @xmath10 filter were collected , respectively . the coordinates and brightness ( in @xmath1 band ) of the variable ,",

    "the standard deviation of the fitting residuals is 0.069 mag for @xmath0 band , 0.052 mag for @xmath1 band , 0.040 mag for @xmath2 band and 0.036 mag for @xmath3 band , respectively.,width=377 ]",
    "the ccd photometric light curves of in @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 bands are analyzed simultaneously with the w - d code ( version 2013 ) .",
    "our solutions suggest that is a w - subtype shallow contact ( @xmath6 ) binary system with its mass ratio to be @xmath4 , where  shallow \" is defined when the degree of contact is lower than @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the temperature difference between its two components is @xmath5 which may imply that is a newly formed contact binary system .",
    "it is just under geometrical contact and will evolve to be a thermal contact binary system .",
    "the less massive star contributes about @xmath14 of the total luminosity in the binary system . during the calculations",
    ", we also set @xmath15 as an adjustable parameter in the w - d code .",
    "however , we havent detected the contribution of the third light in the light curves .",
    "the high orbital inclination ( @xmath7 ) implies that is a total eclipsing binary system and the photometric parameters obtained by us are quite reliable . by assuming that the primary star in is a normal main sequence star , we estimate the mass of the primary star to be @xmath16 @xcite . considering the mass ratio of @xmath4 derived by us , the mass of the secondary star is calculated to be @xmath17 .",
    "the radii and luminosity of the two components are determined to be : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the orbital semi - major axis of is calculated to be @xmath22 .",
    "the formation and evolutionary theories of contact binaries are still unclear .",
    "the most possible scenario is that they are formed from initially detached binary systems through the angular momentum loss ( aml ) via the magnetic wind @xcite .",
    "a late type star component may have played an important role in the formation process @xcite .",
    "therefore , the w uma type systems are ideal targets to test this theory and the photometric analyses of the w uma type systems will provide invaluable information on the research of star formation and evolution . as for",
    ", the temperature difference between its two components suggest that the system is under poor thermal contact",
    ". it may be a newly formed contact binary system .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the majority of w - subtype contact binaries are shallow contact systems .",
    "our results for confirm the conclusion and imply that may be undergoing the thermal relaxation oscillation ( tro ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orbit of the binary system will shrink and expand under the control of the angular momentum loss ( aml ) and the thermal relaxation oscillation ( tro ) .",
    "the degree of contact will increase and the system will evolve into a fully thermal contact configuration as the increasing times of oscillating circles @xcite .",
