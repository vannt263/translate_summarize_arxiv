    "in this paper we present a detailed study of the supersymmetric yang - mills quantum mechanics ( symqm ) with @xmath1 gauge group @xcite .",
    "the addressed system is dimensionally reduced @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills gauge theory .",
    "the reduced model has four supercharges .",
    "it belongs to a broader class of symqm with various dimensions @xmath2 and different symmetry groups @xmath3 . in the past years",
    "many such systems were studied .",
    "bosonic part of symqm in @xmath0 with @xmath4 and @xmath1 gauge symmetry was considered as a zeroth order approximation to the small volume expansion of the theory of gauge fields in qcd @xcite .",
    "later , the @xmath3 theory was given an interpretation of a non - perturbative description of the supermembrane @xcite .",
    "there , @xmath5 plays a role of a cutoff and the theory in continuum is reproduced in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "however , it was shown that such supermembranes are unstable @xcite which was considered as a large setback . later the bfss conjecture , which relates symqm in the large @xmath5 limit and @xmath6 to the dynamics of d0 branes in m - theory ,",
    "was proposed @xcite .",
    "the bfss conjecture aroused a large interest in this model @xcite .",
    "asymptotic ground states for the @xmath4 case were found in @xcite .",
    "the lattice methods were applied in @xcite .",
    "symqm was also studied with hybrid monte carlo approach @xcite .",
    "a program to study the whole family of symqm with various dimensions and gauge groups was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the cut fock space method , which will be our tool was used in a set of papers . in @xcite the @xmath0 model with @xmath4 symmetry group",
    "was addressed .",
    "the @xmath7 case was studied and eventually a complete solution for all @xmath3 was found in @xcite .",
    "there was yet another study based on the schrdinger equation @xcite . with this method",
    "the energies and eigenstates of @xmath0 model with @xmath4 gauge group were found with great precision in the sector with 0-angular momentum and two fermions .    in this paper",
    "the system is solved with the cut fock space method .",
    "the idea of this approach is to represent the hamiltonian as an infinite matrix in the fock basis and to introduce a cutoff .",
    "the cutoff limits the total occupation number of bosons .",
    "thanks to conservation of number of fermions , the hamiltonian can be considered in each fermionic sector separately .",
    "construction of the matrix is performed using a recursive algorithm .",
    "this is the most numerically involved part of calculations .",
    "once the matrix is created , it is diagonalized to obtain its eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",
    "in the central part of this paper we analyze the spectrum in channels with definite number of fermions and angular momentum .",
    "an important question is to distinguish the discrete spectrum from the continuous one .",
    "this analysis is based on dependence of energies on the cutoff .",
    "it turns out that the spectrum in the few lowest fermionic channels is discrete , while the continuum spectrum appears for many fermions .",
    "this conclusion was already found for the case of @xmath4 @xcite and is now confirmed also for @xmath1 .    finally , the supersymmetry multiplets are identified and discussed . for a finite cutoff the supersymmetry is broken and there are no degenerate supermultiplets . in order to identify states which form multiplets in the continuum limit , we define so called supersymmetry fractions .",
    "they measure how supercharges map some energy eigenstates into other .",
    "values of supersymmetry fractions in the continuum limit are known .",
    "therefore , they are useful to analyze the degree of breaking of supersymmetry . moreover , they help to identify susy partners .",
    "the supersymmetric yang - mills quantum mechanics is obtained by dimensional reduction of the yang - mills field theory @xcite .",
    "the full space is then reduced to a single point .",
    "therefore , the gauge field @xmath8 depends only on @xmath9 .",
    "we work in the temporal gauge @xmath10 and adopt the notation of quantum mechanics @xmath11 .",
    "finally , symqm with @xmath1 gauge group in four dimensions is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 spatial indices @xmath13 take values @xmath14 and color indices @xmath15 range from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 are the alpha matrices .",
    "bosonic position and momentum operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfy canonical commutation relations @xmath21=i\\delta^{ab}\\delta_{ij}$ ] whereas @xmath22 is a majorana spinor satisfying @xmath23 .",
    "physical states are gauge singlets .",
    "that is , the hilbert space is limited to states @xmath24 for which @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are generators of @xmath1 .",
    "in what follows in all explicit calculations the weyl representation of dirac matrices from @xcite will be used . in this representation",
    "@xmath27 the majorana condition for @xmath22 reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 it is convenient to express @xmath22 in terms of a two component complex spinor @xmath30 as @xmath31 @xcite , where fermionic operators are defined to satisfy canonical anticommutation relations @xmath32 the majorana condition and anticommutation relations for @xmath22 follow automatically .    in what follows",
    "the matrix notation will be used . for an operator @xmath33 with an adjoint @xmath1 index",
    "we define @xmath34 where @xmath35 are generators of @xmath1 in the fundamental representation .",
    "we use normalization in which multiplication law of @xmath35 reads @xmath36 in the matrix notation the hamiltonian has the form @xmath37 ^ 2+(\\gamma_k)_{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi^\\dagger_\\alpha[\\psi_\\beta , x^k]\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we come to discussion of symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "the supersymmetry gives rise to supercharges which are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "they obey anticommutation relations @xmath40 in the space of gauge singlets the anticommutator @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the system has rotational symmetry inherited from the field theory .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian commutes with angular momentum operators which are given by @xmath43    a remarkable feature of the four - dimensional theory is conservation of the total number of fermions @xmath44 .",
    "this symmetry allows one to study each sector with given @xmath45 independently , which is useful in practice .",
    "because of the pauli exclusion principle there are @xmath46 sectors with @xmath47 .",
    "this symmetry is a property only of @xmath48 and @xmath49-dimensional theories .",
    "it is not present e.g. in 10 dimensions which is interesting due to the bfss conjecture .",
    "furthermore , there is a particle - hole symmetry : @xmath50 a natural consequence of this symmetry is that one can find eigenstates of the hamiltonian which are even or odd under ( [ eq : ph_symmetry ] ) . on the other hand , conservation of @xmath45",
    "implies that the full hilbert space splits into 17 independent sectors with definite number of fermions .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry relates these sectors pairwise . for each state with @xmath45 fermions",
    "there is a state with @xmath51 fermions and the same energy .",
    "therefore , one needs to study only @xmath52 .",
    "we scale the variables as follows : @xmath53 so that the only dependency on @xmath54 is the overall factor @xmath55 multiplying the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the energy depends trivially on the coupling constant .",
    "@xmath54 will be dropped in the rest of this paper .",
    "finally , consider parity .",
    "operators transform under parity in the following way : @xmath56 the hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation ( [ eq : parity ] ) .",
    "however , the spinor @xmath57 does not satisfy the majorana condition .",
    "it follows that states generated by @xmath57 are not invariant under the charge conjugation .",
    "therefore , the parity is broken at the level of the hilbert space .",
    "still , parity is conserved in the bosonic sector .",
    "in this section we discuss a numerical technique , called cut fock space method , which is used to solve our model .",
    "it originates from the variational tamm - dancoff method @xcite where one uses a small set of trial states to construct an approximate ground state of a theory .",
    "it is also used in the context of quantization on the light cone where the harmonic resolution plays the role of a cutoff @xcite .",
    "the cut fock space method was already applied with success to other simpler models .",
    "properties of the cut fock space were studied for one - dimensional quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the technique was used for computations with high precision for the double well potential @xcite and multiple wells with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it was also applied to symqm in two dimensions @xcite and finally to four dimensional theory with @xmath4 gauge group @xcite .      in order to construct the fock space",
    "we introduce creation and annihilation operators , which satisfy the usual commutation rules @xmath58 @xmath59=\\delta^{ab}\\delta_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at this stage @xmath60 is a free parameter and will be used later to improve accuracy of results .",
    "the fock vacuum is defined as usual by @xmath61 all other states are generated by acting with bosonic and fermionic creation operators on the empty state .",
    "however , one can choose only specific combinations of creation operators to generate the space of gauge invariant states .",
    "take a set of operators @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the lower index is not related to any symmetry and @xmath64 can be any operators .",
    "the object @xmath65 is called a _",
    "trace operator_. the number of operators @xmath66 is referred to as _ length _ of the trace . for the rest of this paper the round bracket @xmath67 is used for a short notation of the trace .",
    "if all operators @xmath68 are bosonic or fermionic creation operators then @xmath69 is called a _",
    "brick_. a product of bricks is called a _",
    "composite brick_. it was shown @xcite that the space of gauge singlets is spanned by states obtained by acting with composite bricks on the fock vacuum .",
    "a state generated by a composite brick has a definite number of bosons @xmath70 and fermions @xmath71 @xmath72 therefore , we associate the occupation labels @xmath73 with a composite brick .",
    "the hamiltonian conserves @xmath45 , so it is convenient to work with subspaces with fixed number of fermions @xmath74 .",
    "the cut fock space @xmath75 is then the space of all states which contain precisely @xmath45 fermions and @xmath76 .",
    "the cutoff can be different for each @xmath45 .",
    "the cut fock space can be decomposed into subspaces with definite occupation numbers @xmath77 where components of @xmath78 satisfy @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "a subspace @xmath81 is spanned by all composite bricks with occupation labels @xmath82 acting on the fock vacuum .",
    "the cut fock space method will be used to construct matrices for several operators .",
    "the angular momentum operators conserve @xmath45 and @xmath83 , so the cut matrices of these operators are @xmath84 .",
    "eigenvalues of these matrices are exact eigenvalues of @xmath85 .",
    "the hamiltonian conserves @xmath45 but not @xmath83 .",
    "the matrix @xmath86 has eigenvalues which approximate energy levels of the hamiltonian in the @xmath87 limit .",
    "finally , matrices of @xmath88 will be constructed .",
    "supercharges do not conserve @xmath45 .",
    "in chapter [ ch : supersymmetric_multiplets ] we introduce @xmath89 which also play role of supercharges .",
    "operators @xmath89 decrease the number of fermions by @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we generate matrices @xmath90 . in practice",
    "the two cutoffs @xmath91 and @xmath92 are always different .",
    "the set all composite bricks acting on the empty state is an overcomplete basis of the full fock space . for optimization reasons it is necessary to have as few basis states as possible . in this section",
    "we identify and remove those bricks which can be expressed in terms of other bricks .",
    "the cayley hamilton theorem states that a matrix is a root of its characteristic polynomial .",
    "let @xmath93 be a square traceless matrix of size 3 .",
    "then , the theorem implies that @xmath94 recall that @xmath67 is a short notation for a trace .",
    "this theorem holds if the matrix is operator - valued , i.e. its elements are operators , as long as the matrix elements commute . multiply the above equation by another operator - valued matrix @xmath95 and take a trace .",
    "then , @xmath96 it follows that if a brick contains an expression which is repeated three times and at least one more operator , then it can be written in terms of shorter bricks and therefore is redundant .",
    "the simplest example of such brick is @xmath97 .",
    "there are other relations for fermionic operators .",
    "if @xmath93 is an operator - valued matrix with anticommuting matrix elements , then the following identities hold @xcite : @xmath98 another identity for generators of @xmath1 reads @xcite @xmath99 curly brackets denote symmetrization without additional coefficient @xmath100 . for any six bricks that differ by permutations of three operators , one of them can be eliminated .",
    "there is one more relation @xcite concerning @xmath35 , namely a product of six @xmath1 generators @xmath101 can be expressed in terms of its trace and a linear combination of shorter products multiplied by some tensors .",
    "each of these tensors is a product of traces of products of generators .",
    "each trace has less than six generators inside .",
    "it follows that any brick longer than six can be decomposed into shorter bricks and it is therefore redundant .",
    "it follows that there is only a finite number of brick in total .",
    "finally , if a set of composite bricks @xmath102 acting on the fock vacuum gives linearly dependent states , i.e. @xmath103 then the composite bricks themselves are linearly dependent : @xmath104    in each sector with given occupation labels @xmath82 one can use the gauss elimination method to find all relations of the kind ( [ eq : dependent_paths ] ) .",
    "if at least one brick @xmath105 is not composite , then it is redundant by the virtue of ( [ eq : dependent_paths2 ] ) . a single relation ( [ eq : dependent_paths2 ] ) allows to discard only one brick .",
    "the gauss elimination method allows one to find the complete set of independent bricks .",
    "the gramm matrix required for the gauss elimination is constructed according to the following part of this section .",
    "we found that there are 786 independent bricks .",
    "we proposed a method to eliminate all dependent bricks .",
    "although their number is finite , there is an infinite number of composite bricks .",
    "this is obvious , because the hilbert space is infinite - dimensional .",
    "moreover , composite bricks are linearly dependent , e.g. @xmath106 .",
    "this dependency can not be removed if one wants to take advantage of the following recursive algorithm .      in this part",
    "we present the algorithm for constructing matrix elements of operators .",
    "although this paper concentrates on the @xmath1 gauge group , the algorithm is suited for the general case with @xmath3 group .",
    "let us first introduce some notation .",
    "composite trace operator _ is a product of trace operators .",
    "_ length _ of the composite trace is the total of lengths of traces in the product .",
    "all operators of our interest , i.e. angular momentum , hamiltonian and supercharges can be expressed by combinations of composite trace operators .",
    "we assume that the traces consist only of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "take an arbitrary gauge invariant operators @xmath107 .",
    "the full hilbert space is decomposed into orthogonal subspaces @xmath108 and each subspace is spanned by composite bricks with occupation numbers @xmath82 acting on the fock vacuum .",
    "the matrix of operator @xmath107 can be written in a block form with blocks @xmath109 .",
    "dimension @xmath110 of @xmath108 is finite for each @xmath82 .",
    "the dimension can be determined numerically as well as with an analytic method @xcite .",
    "@xmath107 can be expressed as a combination of composite traces .",
    "then block @xmath111 is a relevant combination of products of blocks of trace operators . from now on we assume that @xmath107 is a trace operator itself , i.e. @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 be the number of creation operators @xmath114 in @xmath107 minus the number of annihilation operators @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath115 be defined in analogous way .",
    "then @xmath116 is called _ creation labels _ for @xmath107 . obviously , if @xmath117 then the block @xmath111 vanishes .",
    "from now on we consider only @xmath118 .",
    "we shall now make some assumptions .",
    "first , @xmath107 contains at least one annihilation operator . if this is not the case , then @xmath107 is proportional to the identity or contains only creation operators . in the former case ,",
    "the block @xmath111 is proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "if @xmath107 has only creation operators , then we construct @xmath119 and @xmath120 contains only annihilation operators .",
    "secondly , assume that @xmath112 annihilates the empty state .",
    "otherwise , a certain cyclic permutation @xmath121 does annihilate the fock vacuum ( e.g. when @xmath122 is an annihilation operator ) .",
    "the remainder @xmath123 is a combination of composite trace operators .",
    "a standard example is @xmath124 . obviously , @xmath125 is a zero matrix .",
    "more assumptions can be put on the form of @xmath107 to improve efficiency ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , they are not essential for correctness of the algorithm .",
    "let @xmath126 be the set of all bricks that contain at least one creation operator corresponding to the first nonzero component of @xmath82 ( e.g. if @xmath127 it is @xmath128 and if @xmath129 then it is @xmath130 , etc . ) .",
    "the creation labels of @xmath131 will be denoted by @xmath132 .",
    "next , remove all bricks for which @xmath133 , where @xmath134 , is empty .",
    "in particular , all bricks for which at least one component of @xmath135 is negative have to be removed .",
    "@xmath81 is then spanned by composite bricks acting on fock vacuum , each containing at least one brick from the set @xmath126 .",
    "now , take an orthonormal basis @xmath136 in the sector @xmath133 .",
    "vectors @xmath137 span @xmath108 .",
    "the index @xmath138 enumerates all pairs @xmath139 on the right hand side .",
    "vectors @xmath140 may be not orthogonal and the number of them can be greater than the dimension @xmath141 of @xmath108 . this will be taken into account later by orthogonalization matrix .",
    "the block @xmath111 is constructed in two steps .",
    "first , a block in the overcomplete basis is built : @xmath142 it can be written in a block form : @xmath143 each of the sub - blocks is constructed as @xmath144|_{\\mathbf n'\\mathbf n_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and each of the blocks on the right hand side is built recursively . once the block @xmath145 is constructed , we orthogonalize the basis of @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath146 be the gramm matrix in the sector @xmath108 : @xmath147 as before , each sub - block is constructed as @xmath148|_{\\mathbf n_i\\mathbf n_j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    matrix @xmath146 has exactly @xmath110 nonzero eigenvalues @xmath149 .",
    "corresponding eigenvectors @xmath150 are used to produce the basis of @xmath108 .",
    "more precisely , the orthonormal basis is given by @xmath151 finally , we construct the orthogonalization matrix @xmath152 by setting its matrix elements to @xmath153 .",
    "then , @xmath111 is the product of the block in overcomplete basis and the orthogonalization matrix : @xmath154      some remarks concerning diagonalization of matrices are in place .",
    "assume that we constructed matrices of the hamiltonian @xmath42 , square of total angular momentum @xmath155 and the third component of angular momentum @xmath156 in a sector with @xmath45 fermions and cutoff @xmath91 .",
    "in order to obtain energies one can diagonalize @xmath42 and then eventually act with @xmath155 and @xmath156 on eigenvectors to check what are their quantum numbers .",
    "this procedure is however ineffective .",
    "operators @xmath155 and @xmath156 conserve the number of bosons @xmath83 while @xmath42 does not .",
    "therefore , matrices of angular momentum decompose into smaller matrices on subspaces with fixed @xmath83 :    @xmath157    index @xmath45 is dropped for shorter notation .",
    "we diagonalize @xmath158 for each @xmath83 . since these matrices are smaller , it is significantly faster to diagonalize them than @xmath42 . for each value of angular momentum @xmath159",
    "we construct a projection matrix @xmath160 .",
    "it maps @xmath161 onto a subspace @xmath162 corresponding to given @xmath159 .",
    "then @xmath156 on these small subspaces is @xmath163 these matrices are yet smaller and can be diagonalized for each @xmath83 and @xmath159 separately .",
    "projection matrices @xmath164 from @xmath162 to @xmath165 are given by eigenvectors of @xmath166 .",
    "then the projection matrices from @xmath161 to @xmath165 are @xmath167 .",
    "we construct a transition matrix @xmath168 finally , the matrix of hamiltonian in a channel with given @xmath169 is a product @xmath170 .",
    "it is much smaller than the initial full matrix @xmath171 and thus diagonalization is faster .",
    "energies in the cut fock space method are approximated from above .",
    "the parameter @xmath172 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : bosonic_ca_ops ] ) ) is not yet fixed .",
    "it can be used to minimize the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian and thus to improve approximation of the ground energy .",
    "matrix representations of the angular momentum operators are independent of @xmath172",
    ". therefore , projection matrices @xmath173 can be constructed without fixing @xmath172 .",
    "let us now construct matrices of three terms of the hamiltonian @xmath174 with @xmath175 and project them onto the subspace with given @xmath159 and @xmath176 .",
    "then the matrix of the full hamiltonian is @xmath177 matrix of the hamiltonian in the subspace with given angular momentum is relatively small and minimizing its smallest eigenvalue with respect to @xmath172 is fast .",

    "this behavior is typical for discrete spectrum .",
    "the fact that the spectrum is discrete is contrary to what one may naively expect . indeed , if the three matrices @xmath189 commute then the potential vanishes : @xmath190 ^ 2)=0 $ ] .",
    "the region where the potential vanishes forms a vector subspace in the configuration space which we call flat valleys .",
    "in such situation the spectrum is usually continuous . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential becomes steeper in the transverse directions as one moves deeper inside the valleys .",
    "the transverse oscillations cost more energy and thus the effective potential inside the flat valleys , integrated over transverse degrees of freedom , grows .",
