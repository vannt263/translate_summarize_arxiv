    "our understanding of collective behavior in many - body systems in , or near , thermal equilibrium has improved significantly in the past century . by contrast , only recently has there been much attention focused on systems far - from - equilibrium , even for those in steady states .",
    "abundant in nature , such systems exist in an enormous variety of states , most of which can not be predicted using the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics . at present , there is no simple formulation which is generally applicable .",
    "one way to make progress into this vast realm of non - equilibrium physics is to study simple models , especially those with well understood equilibrium properties .",
    "this is the chief motivation of katz , et.al.,@xcite who introduced a seemingly trivial modification to the ising lattice gas@xcite , so that it is driven into _",
    "non - equilibrium steady states_. the other motivation is phase transitions in fast ionic conductors in an external field , though their model predictions have not been compared directly with these physical systems so far .",
    "this model consists of a @xmath2-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice with each site being empty or occupied by a single particle .",
    "its dynamics is particle hopping to nearest neighbor empty sites , with a rate controlled by the energetics of the ising hamiltonian @xmath3 , as well as a bias in one direction so as to describe the effect of a uniform , dc `` electric '' field @xmath4 .",
    "to connect with the equilibrium system , rates are chosen to satisfy `` local '' detailed balance consistent with being in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , by setting @xmath6 , we simply retrieve the canonical @xmath7 as the stationary distribution . since its inception , many unexpected properties have been discovered , for both the original model and its many variants @xcite .",
    "though some of the remarkable behaviors are reasonably well understood , many remain unexplained .",
    "an example is the basic question : why should @xmath8 , the critical temperature for the attractive ( ferromagnetic ) case , increase with @xmath9 ?",
    "simulations ( using metropolis rates for @xmath10 ) show that @xmath11 is about 40% above the onsager temperature @xcite !",
    "indeed , one can easily argue in favor of a _ lowering _ of @xmath12 , as follows .",
    "since large fields would dominate over the inter - particle attraction ( for hops along @xmath9 ) , the system is effectively subjected to an extra noise , so that a lower @xmath5 is needed for clustering and order .    with further explorations of this system , simple arguments in favor of an _ increased _",
    "@xmath12 began to emerge@xcite .",
    "however , there is still no _ compelling _ reason , so far , to accept or reject the contradictory arguments .",
    "in other words , we still have no intuitive picture which can guide us to reliable expectations .",
    "this study is a continuation of the exploration of similar systems @xcite , in an effort to find the underlying mechanisms which give rise to the novel phase diagrams .",
    "specifically , we consider ising models with _",
    "anisotropic _ interactions , i.e. , inter - particle attraction along and transverse to the drive being unequal ( @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "such a model was previously studied , but only in the fast rate limit @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , though very interesting in its own right , this limit is too singular to provide us with much insight into the original lattice gas .",
    "for example , no trace of @xmath9 remains , yet a phase transition prevails even for @xmath16 ! in the following section , we describe our model , restricting our attention to @xmath17 only .",
    "simulations lead to more surprises , the details of which will be presented in section 3 .",
    "the next section is devoted to a theoretical study , using high temperature series expansion techniques on the two - point correlation function @xcite .",
    "a final section is devoted to a summary , conclusions and outlook .",
    "our system consists of fully periodic @xmath19 square lattices , with the sites labeled by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are integers modulo @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . each site may be empty or occupied by a particle , so that a configuration of the system is specified by the set of occupation numbers @xmath25 , where @xmath26or @xmath27",
    "this model is simply related to the original ising one for spins through the relation @xmath28 , which takes on values @xmath29 .",
    "since our interest is a system of particles , @xmath30 is fixed . for simplicity , we study only half - filled systems , i.e. , @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) .",
    "next , we endow the particles with _ anisotropic _",
    "nearest neighbor attraction and write the hamiltonian as @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the factor of 4 is included so that the hamiltonian is equivalent ( given the constraint @xmath32 ) to the standard ising form , @xmath35 . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce anisotropy via a `` dimensionless '' parameter @xmath36 , through @xmath37 so that @xmath38 carries the `` overall '' strength of the interactions .",
    "when this system reaches equilibrium with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath5 , it displays well known properties in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the most prominent behavior is a second order transition , from a disordered homogeneous phase to a phase segregated state , when @xmath5 is lowered through the onsager temperature @xmath39 .",
    "expressed in units of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath39 can be obtained from the equation @xcite @xmath42 for the quantity @xmath43 .",
    "specifically , @xmath44 , which serves as the unit for all the temperatures quoted in this paper . using this unit , a plot of @xmath45",
    "is provided in fig .",
    "1 . note that , due to the conservation law , the ordered state will be a strip spanning the system aligned with the @xmath21- or @xmath22-axis .",
    "these states will be denotes by h ( horizontal ) and v ( vertical ) , respectively . since the equilibrium state will be the one with the lowest interfacial free energy , the aspect ratio of the system , @xmath46 , will play a role as well . for @xmath47 , clearly @xmath48 marks the `` phase boundary '' between the two states , also shown in fig .",
    "2 . we expect , of course , that the h - v boundary is associated with a first order transition . for general @xmath46 , this boundary is located at that @xmath49 which satisfies @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the surface tension for the horizontal interface , etc .    in computer studies , the simulation of the lattice gas , in equilibrium with a bath at temperature @xmath5 , would rely on `` spin - exchange '' dynamics@xcite , so as to respect particle conservation .",
    "in other words , particles are allowed to hop to nearest neighbor holes with a rate obeying detailed balance appropriate for @xmath5 .",
    "a favorite rate is due to metropolis @xcite , where jump rates are given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the change in energy due to the hop . in the generalization to a _ driven _ lattice gas , we follow katz , et .",
    "al . and incorporate the `` electric '' field ( aligned with the @xmath22-axis ) in the standard way , i.e. , by adding @xmath54 to @xmath53 for hops against / along the field @xcite .",
    "our goal is to map out the phase diagram in the @xmath5-@xmath36-@xmath9 space . in the following",
    ", we will report the main results , denoting the line of second ( first ) order transitions by @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and quoting @xmath9 in units of @xmath38 .",
    "details will be published elsewhere @xcite .",

    "the system is evolved in the standard way . in a monte carlo step ( mcs ) ,",

    "particle_. most runs are 400k mcs long .",
    "the initial configurations are either random or fully ordered ( in h or v ) .",
    "typically , we discard the first 100k mcs , allowing the system to settle into the steady state .",

    ", we obtain the structure factors @xmath66 in the disordered state , they are of order unity and convey information about two - particle correlations . below the transition , they are sensitive to the h- or v - ordered state , in the sense that , e.g. , @xmath67 or @xmath68 will be @xmath69 , and carry information about the densities of phase segregated states . for example , for a completely ordered v state , we obtain @xmath70 while @xmath71 ^{-1},$ ] which approaches @xmath72 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "of course , in an ordered h state , these two @xmath73 s are reversed . in this sense , @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "may be viewed as order parameters@xcite .",
    "in addition to the mean of @xmath74 , we measure the variance , @xmath75 , which plays a role similar to that of the susceptibility in equilibrium systems . for those @xmath73 s which are @xmath76",
    "the associated @xmath77 s are expected to be just @xmath78 itself @xcite .",
    "deep in the ordered phases , though some @xmath73 s will be @xmath69 , the @xmath77 s are expected to be still @xmath79 .",
    "however , near a second order transition , the @xmath77 s should diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have also exploited other initial configurations , different sizes and rectangular systems .",
    "these will be discussed in the following sub - sections .      in the first part of our study",
    ", we restrict ourselves to saturation drive ( @xmath80 here ) and to only one system size / geometry : @xmath81 . since the field is large enough to overcome all levels of particle attraction , it is hardly surprising that the ordered state can only be v. measuring the structure factors",
    ", we confirm this expectation , in that only @xmath82 ( @xmath83 odd ) grow substantially as @xmath5 is lowered . specifically , starting with random configurations , we perform 400 k  mcs runs for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we used a range of step sizes in @xmath5 , the smallest being @xmath86 , especially when large variations in measured quantities were encountered . identifying the transition through the peak of @xmath87",
    "we find the line of second order transitions @xmath88 to be a _ monotonically decreasing _ function of @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",
    "this behavior is contrary to our previous conjecture@xcite , showing that our intuitive picture , based on the competition of long and short ranged correlations , is still far from being reliable .",
    "more surprisingly , the critical temperature of the driven system is not always greater than that for the equilibrium system ! note that , in fig . 1 .",
    ", @xmath89 is the theoretical result for an infinite lattice , while @xmath88 is found in the @xmath81 system .",
    "( the effects of finite size will be discussed in a later sub - section . )",
    "a further distinction is that , while the driven system orders only into the v state , the equilibrium system may order into h or v depending on @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "we should caution that the uncertainties associated with @xmath92 are much larger than the step size of @xmath93 in particular , for @xmath5 greater than the quoted @xmath94 , @xmath68 does not decrease in a simple way , especially for systems with large @xmath95 in these cases , we frequently observe breakup of a single strip into two - strip states . as a result ,",
    "as @xmath5 is raised through this @xmath94 , not only does @xmath96 becomes large , @xmath97 also increases by as much as an order of magnitude . in this sense , it is possible to regard the quoted values as a lower bound for the critical temperature .",
    "typically , at temperatures @xmath98 30% higher than @xmath99 , we can be quite certain that the system is disordered . to be more confident and precise about critical temperatures",
    ", we must use more sophisticated methods , e.g. , histograms of various @xmath73 s , finite size scaling , etc.@xcite      next , we turn to systems with small drives , searching for the remnants of the h phase . keeping the same system size ( @xmath81 ) , we chose @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that there is a range of values for the ratio @xmath102 .",
    "expecting continuous transitions in the neighborhood of the equilibrium line , we performed simulations in the manner described above . as displayed in fig .",
    "2 , the behavior of @xmath103 is quite complex . for @xmath104 , @xmath12 first increases and then decreases , so as to match with the low value of @xmath105 found above . for @xmath48 , the known monotonic increase of @xmath12 is confirmed . in its neighborhood ,",
    "both @xmath106 and @xmath107 appear to be monotonic in @xmath9 . in the latter case ,",
    "the ordered phase remains v , despite the fact @xmath90 .",
    "this reflects the known effect of the drive : setting up positive long range correlations along the drive and so , favoring strips aligned vertically . for @xmath108 and",
    "the @xmath9 s we have chosen , the systems orders into v or h depending on the drive . for those cases where the ordered phase is h , it is completely unexpected that @xmath103 is still typically _ greater _ than the equilibrium @xmath89 ! since the drive is known to _ reduce _ correlations in the transverse direction , we must find a new argument for how ordering ( into h ) could occur at a higher temperature .",
    "remarkably , @xmath103 suffers a dip at the bi - critical point . as a result , for a fixed @xmath36",
    ", it is seen first to increase with @xmath9 ( while ordering into h ) , then to decrease to the minimum value @xmath109 when the drive reaches @xmath110 , a strength just strong enough to change the ordering to v , and finally , to increase again with stronger drives . given our accuracy",

    "the disordered region is labelled by d ; the ordered ones by h and v ( see text ) .",
    "turning to the line of discontinuous transitions , we modified our methods .",

    ", we are able to look for hysteresis in such sweeps . in both cases , @xmath36 is increased and decreased by steps of @xmath86 and the system evolved for 200k mcs at each step .",
    "the ratio @xmath123 is monitored and is seen to jump from 1 to -1 and vice versa .",
    "@xmath124 is found by averaging the values of @xmath36 where the jump occurs .",
    "for lower @xmath5 , the metastable life times are too long and hysteresis loops become too large to be reliable .",
    "thus , we resort to another method , which , to our knowledge , is entirely new .",
    "though it does not _ necessarily _ identify the loci of first order transitions , we argue that it should provide a good indication .",
    "this approach relies on a conjecture of the saddle point configuration , namely , an `` x '' ( fig .",
    "3a ) , which is chosen via symmetry considerations . given the anisotropies in the system ( due to both @xmath125 and @xmath9 ) , we concede that the saddle point may be a configuration with less symmetry , e.g. , an `` l '' ( fig .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the `` x '' should be a good starting point .",

    "emerge , providing us with good averages and standard deviations .",
    "next , we carried out 200 independent runs for each of the above ( @xmath136 ) , _ starting with the _ ``",
    "x''__configuration__. the above @xmath73 s are measured every 200 mcs .",
    "the runs are terminated when 10 consecutive measurements ( i.e. , over a period of 2 k mcs ) of each @xmath73 fall within 3 standard deviations of the averages .",
    "the fraction of runs which terminate in the v state is recorded and found to increase monotonically with @xmath36 ( with fixed @xmath137 ) .",
    "the points where this fraction reaches 1/2 are considered ( part of ) the line of first order transitions from h to v. ( see fig .",
    "@xmath112 possible saddle point configurations : ( a ) `` x '' and ( b ) ",
    "l.    finally , for @xmath138 , all ordered states we have observed are v. thus , we never explored the line of first order transitions . to keep fig.2 relatively clear ,",
    "we display this line of continuous transitions in fig.1 instead .",
    "it is possible that first order transitions occur just outside the range of @xmath125 s we used .",
    "indeed , the slight dip of @xmath139 at @xmath140 is actually due to behavior which is more complicated than that in systems with higher @xmath36 . for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , even though the system actually orders into v for @xmath143 , i.e. , @xmath144 in between , the fluctuations of both structure factors are comparably large . in this sense , it is possible that ( @xmath145 ) is very close to the bi - critical point . to explore further",
    ", we must set @xmath146 .",
    "however , we believe that , with @xmath147 , reliable conclusions can not be drawn from simulations with a lattice as small as @xmath81 .      the above data were collected on a single system size : @xmath81 .",
    "of course , true phase transitions accompanied by thermodynamic singularities are properties of infinite systems .",
    "any conclusions would rely on either simple extrapolations or more sophisticated methods of finite size scaling . with our limitations of computation power , we are able to make only cursory explorations of the effects of finite size . in particular , we studied @xmath148 and @xmath149 systems , only for @xmath150 and the extreme @xmath125 s .",
    "the transition temperatures are summarized in table 1 .",
    "similar to the equilibrium cases , the transition temperatures tend to rise with larger sizes .",
    "although there are some significant increases , we can safely conclude , from the trends displayed here , that the general features of figs.1 and 2 will survive the thermodynamic limit .",
    "transition temperatures for various @xmath151 and @xmath95    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we also investigated the effects of having rectangular systems . by varying the aspect ratio",
    ", we can insure that the _ ground state _ of the equilibrium system is in the v- or the h - state , with the crossover point at @xmath152 .",
    "we could study systems with these aspect ratios . on the other hand , at any finite temperature",
    ", the `` crossover '' @xmath153 is given by the ratio of surface energies associated with the interfaces @xcite aligned along the two axes , i.e. , @xmath154    in other words , for a given aspect ratio , this equation provides the phase boundary between h- and v - states . by duality ,",
    "this ratio is also the one for the correlation lengths associated with two - point correlations along the two axes@xcite in the disordered phase .",
    "thus , another possibility is to study systems which , near criticality , behave isotropically when the rectangular systems are rescaled to be square ones .",
    "since our interest is mainly in disorder - order transitions , we adopted the latter choice here . evaluating ( [ m / l ] ) near @xmath12 , we arrived at lattice sizes @xmath155 @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( for @xmath158 @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively ) , in order to compare with the @xmath81 case at @xmath48 . by symmetry , systems with",
    "the opposite aspect ratio are used for @xmath161 .",
    "keeping in mind the previous discussion concerning the uncertainties associated with @xmath12 , we display the results in fig.4 .",
    "note that the equilibrium line is _ not shown _ , since it is so close to the @xmath128 points that confusion may arise .",
    "it is unclear if this insensitivity of @xmath162 to the drive is significant or not .",

    "the lowering of @xmath164 is curious .",
    "this point also coincides with ordering into an h - state . comparing with fig .",
    "2 , we see that there are two main effects due to rectangular lattices : ( i ) displacement of the first order line to smaller @xmath36 s and ( ii ) lowering of the transition temperatures into the h - state .",
    "the lack of a dip in the @xmath138 case is consistent with the bi - critical point being at @xmath165 .",
    "apart from these features , system geometry seems to play no discernible role , especially for large drives . that the system subjected to small @xmath9 orders into h - states may be related to the fact that , at low temperatures , the h - state is favored in the equilibrium systems according to eqn.([m / l ] ) .",
    "clearly , there remains a large gap between our understanding of these systems and the rich phenomena displayed .",
    "though the driven lattice gas model was introduced 15 years ago , there is still no _ reliable _ means to predict the general features of the phase diagram .",
    "the dynamic mean - field approach @xcite , while quantitatively more satisfying , is so labor - intensive that it provides us with little insight on why critical temperatures shifts to higher values .",
    "this method can certainly be extended to our anisotropic system .",
    "another route to an estimate of the shift of @xmath12 is based on a recent study of the two - point correlation function @xmath166 in a `` high temperature '' expansion@xcite , which is actually an expansion in small @xmath38 or @xmath167 . in this approach ,",
    "an approximate equation for @xmath166 , first derived in @xcite is solved exactly .",

    "these findings remain essentially unchanged for systems up to @xmath149 , leading us to believe that @xmath55 for the infinite system is not likely to be drastically different from those reported here . for drives of the order of @xmath38 , the transitions from the disordered to an ordered phase",
    "are continuous .",
    "the transition temperatures are generally greater than the equilibrium @xmath12 s , at least within the range of @xmath210 $ ] explored .",
    "the phase diagram is more complex ( fig .",
    "2 ) , since two ordered states ( a strip aligned along or transverse to the drive ) appear , depending on @xmath36 and @xmath211 the transition between h- and v - states is , as expected , discontinuous . for reasons yet to be fathomed , the line of continuous transitions `` dips '' at the bi - critical point , where it meets the h - v phase boundary . finally , we have also investigated _ rectangular _ systems with aspect ratios which depend on @xmath36 in such a way that , near criticality , these behave isotropically with a simple rescaling of the axes . though some differences are observed , the phase diagrams are qualitatively unchanged .    on the theoretical front , we have estimated the transition temperatures for large drives , using the simplest method available : first order in a `` high temperature '' expansion . unfortunately , only the most qualitative feature is reproduced , namely , @xmath212 is _ greater _ than unity for @xmath213 . since this method is insensitive to @xmath205 , the more interesting aspects of the phase diagram are inaccessible .",
    "we hope that dynamic mean field methods @xcite , which can probe small drives , will be successful in producing the behavior in this region of @xmath5-@xmath36-@xmath9 space .",
    "clearly , this study should be regarded as an initial exploration , providing us with rough guidelines on which parts of the phase diagram to probe deeper .",
    "many interesting questions await more detailed simulations as well as theoretical analyses .",
    "we end with a sample list here .",
    "the critical behavior of an equilibrium system is independent of @xmath36 , i.e. , whether the system orders into a v- or an h - state .",
    "however , for driven systems , renormalized field theory predicts drastically different behavior for these two types of ordering @xcite .",
    "( a ) in particular , we expect that transitions into v - states belong to the universality class of the standard driven system , with 5 being the upper critical dimension , etc .",
    "thus , checking the validity of this prediction by simulations would be desirable .",
    "( b ) on the other hand , there are no infrared stable fixed points for a theory with longitudinal phase separation , so that this approach fails to describe any of the second order transitions into h - states .",
    "this kind of ordering is observed in several other non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "an interesting question for simulations studies is whether any of these systems share the same critical behavior , thereby establishing new classes of driven diffusive systems .",
    "( c ) similar issues arise for the `` bi - critical point '' .",
    "for an equilibrium system , due to the underlying symmetry , there can be no new behavior .",
    "however , for the driven systems , we expect the two critical lines to fall into different universality classes , so that there must be non - trivial cross - over phenomena associated with this point .",
    "a similar situation arises in the driven bi - layer lattice gas @xcite .",
    "( d ) in the context of the above issues , finite size scaling@xcite stands out as the common and central analytical tool .",
    "( e ) for the line of first order transitions at lower @xmath5 , we could improve the accuracy in several ways .",
    "this boundary was determined by starting runs with a conjectured saddle point configuration ( `` x '' ) .",
    "checking with other initial configurations ( e.g. , `` l '' ) should increase confidence in our findings . running with more sophisticated algorithms , so as to circumvent the long metastable life - times , would be very desirable .",
    "( f ) finally , the interfaces in the ordered h - states are necessarily inequivalent , since the drive tends to deposit particles on one and remove particles from the other .",
    "interfacial correlations in the standard driven systems ( ordered in v - states ) display remarkable properties @xcite .",
    "a natural question is : what is the nature of the correlation here ?",
    "in addition , long wavelength interface instabilities are quite possible @xcite , so that it will be extremely interesting to investigate systems with much larger @xmath151 . from this study",
    ", it is clear that we are still far from having an intuitive picture of why driven systems order in the way they do .",
    "hopefully , with the completion of some of these suggested investigations , we will be closer to the understanding of these deceptively simple non - equilibrium systems .",
    "@xmath214      it is a pleasure to dedicate this article to john cahn , who has devoted much of his work to the dynamics of diffusive systems within the context of binary alloys .",
