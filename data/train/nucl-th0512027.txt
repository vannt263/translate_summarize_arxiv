    "the equation of state for strongly interacting matter at finite density is needed for understanding of neutron stars @xcite and heavy ion collision phenomenology @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting open questions for such system is the identification of the appropriate degrees of freedom to describe the different phases of matter .",
    "one expects that effective degrees of freedom change from baryons at low density to quarks and gluons at high density .",
    "therefore , at high density nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to deconfined quarks and gluons and chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "our current knowledge about this transition is still very rudimentary since qcd lattice computation can not yet be performed at large density . in this paper",
    "we attempt to describe the first order liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter , the chiral phase transition , and the transition to quark matter in a unified framework . for this purpose",
    ", we work within an effective chiral linear sigma model coupled to nucleons and quarks .    the chiral linear sigma model and its extension have been successful in explaining the low energy physics of mesons and nucleons in vacuum due to utilizing the concept of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however this model has been less successful at finite density .",
    "very early studies by kerman and miller @xcite showed that the linear sigma model ( l@xmath1n ) model with nucleonic degrees of freedom in fact does not lead to saturating nuclear matter in mean field approximation .",
    "this failure is due to the fact that in chiral models with mexican hat potential , the medium effect moves the vacuum effective potential towards smaller values .",
    "this implies a smaller curvature and consequently the mass of the scalar field decreases .",
    "the scalar field in the linear sigma model plays the role of the chiral partner of the pion and the mediator of medium - range nucleon - nucleon attraction .",
    "therefore , as its mass becomes smaller the attraction between nucleons becomes stronger .",
    "this simple effect may destroy the stability of nuclear matter .",
    "boguta @xcite showed , however , that a saturating normal ground state in the l@xmath1n model can be reproduced by introducing a vector - scalar coupling in a chirally invariant way and generating a mass to the vector - meson via spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this approach",
    "the saturation stems from the cancellation of large repulsive vector mesons and attractive scalar mesons which is generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    ". however , unacceptably large compression modulus of nuclear matter ( about @xmath2 mev ) still remain difficult to overcome within this approach .",
    "another short - coming of this approach is the absence of the chiral phase transition , since the effective nucleon mass tends to grow at high density @xcite .",
    "there has been some attempt to overcome these difficulties by introducing an additional field , the dilaton which is devised to effectively incorporate the trace anomaly in qcd @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that a chirally restored phase in the presence of vector - meson coupling to the dilaton is only possible at unphysically high values of compressibility ( @xmath3 mev ) @xcite .",
    "this paper is an attempt to resolve both problems , namely high compressibility and the absence of abnormal phase .",
    "we will show that inclusion of the dirac - sea in a non - renormaliazble fashion reduces the compressibility .",
    "the chiral phase transition is expected to occur at high density where the baryonic degrees of freedom are no longer appropriate .",
    "we show that the chiral restoration can be described by incorporating the quark degrees of freedom into the l@xmath1n model at high density .",
    "we simulate the quark deconfinement at finite density by changing the active degrees of freedom from nucleons to quarks at high density .",
    "this leads to a first order deconfinement phase transition , in accordance with indications from earlier studies @xcite . in our simple model quark deconfinement and chiral restoration",
    "are interconnected . a general outcome of our analysis concerns the crucial importance of deconfinement for understanding the chiral restoration at finite density .",
    "initially , the quantum hydrodynamical model was based on renormalizable field theory . therefore , a systematic inclusion of vacuum loops was necessary in order to accommodate the response of a filled dirac - sea to the presence of valence nucleons . by renormalizability requirement",
    "one could then absorb the vacuum loops and redefine the coefficients of the effective potential .",
    "however it was shown that the resulting effective potential does not provide an acceptable description of the properties of finite nuclei , and inclusion of next - to - leading order loop expansion even worsens the situation @xcite .",
    "furnstahl _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite showed also that one - baryon - loop vacuum contribution in renormalized models like the l@xmath1n model and the walecka model give rise to large _ unnatural _",
    "coefficients based on `` naive dimensional analysis '' proposed by georgi and manohar @xcite , indicating that the quantum vacuum is not described adequately by long - range degree of freedoms .",
    "one possible resolution to the _ unnaturalness _ has been non - renormalizable effective field theory approach , where one includes all possible terms consistent with the underlying symmetry , hoping that short - range physics can be taken into account by non - linear higher order interaction terms . in this way",
    ", there is no reference to a dirac sea of nucleons . in this paper , we take a radical approach and introduce an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath4 into the definition of the chiral sigma model . in our approach",
    "the cutoff is taken as new extra parameter which needs to be fixed by some phenomenological input .",
    "therefore , our model by default becomes non - renormalizable , similar to the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . in this way by construction one does not need to absorb the vacuum loops into interaction terms , and therefore the unnaturalness problem can be avoided . with the cutoff we can discard the short - range physics which can not be described by long - range degrees of freedom . in other words , the sharp cutoff @xmath4 separates the active negative energy states from the ones that does not contribute . in this way",
    ", we explicitly retain the intuitive concept of dirac sea as a counterpart of fermi sea .    in the first part of the paper ( section ii ) we study nuclear matter properties within an extended l@xmath1n model in present of explicit dirac - sea . in the second part of paper ( section iii )",
    ", we incorporate the quark degrees of freedom above deconfinement density .",
    "having calibrated the parameters of the model to the empirical nuclear matter saturation , we investigate the implication of quark deconfinement in the equation of state and in the description of the chiral restoration .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we consider the chiral l@xmath1n model with exact global @xmath5 symmetry , which contains a pseudoscalar coupling between pions and nucleons , plus an auxiliary scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "we also include a massive isoscalar vector field @xmath6 , @xmath7\\psi_{n } + \\mathcal{l}_{\\sigma\\pi}+\\mathcal{l}_{\\sigma\\omega } ,   \\label{n0}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined as @xmath10 and the field tensor is defined @xmath11 .",
    "the nucleon mass @xmath12 and vector - meson mass @xmath13 at rest are generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking by @xmath1-field @xmath14 for uniform nuclear matter , the ground state is obtained by filling energy level with spin - isospin degeneracy @xmath15 up to the fermi momentum @xmath16 , where @xmath16 is related to the baryon density @xmath17 by @xmath18 we employ the conventional mean - field approximation by expanding the meson fields around their expectation values @xmath19 and @xmath20 neglecting meson fluctuations .",
    "the mean values of the pion field and space component of the vector field vanish for a baryonic matter at rest due to symmetry .",
    "having used the equation of motion for the @xmath21 field , the energy density can be expressed as @xmath22 where nucleon and vector masses are defined in eq .",
    "( [ n1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath23 denotes the mean - value of sigma field in vacuum . the second line in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) describes the negative - energy nucleon dirac - sea contribution @xmath24 subtracted from its corresponding value at zero density .",
    "this term is divergent , we regularize it by a sharp ultraviolet cutoff @xmath4 .",
    "the linear sigma model is renormalizable , therefore any cutoff dependence should be removed by some kind of renormalization scheme in a such way that the chiral symmetry of the model is preserved .",
    "the vacuum expression can be expanded in powers of @xmath25 which creates an infinite series in terms of scalar mean - field ( notice that the only first four orders are divergent ) . by employing a renormalization scheme , one",
    "can then partly absorb these terms into the coefficients of the effective potential @xcite ( note also that this procedure is not unique ) , @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the renormalization scale ( which is normally chosen to be nucleon mass at zero density ) and @xmath28 denotes the counterterms .",
    "the logarithmic term @xmath29 , however can not be removed in this fashion .",
    "the renormalizability requirement imposes very restrictive conditions on these highly nonlinear terms .",
    "it has been shown that such a renormalized theory is in apparent conflict with the _ naturalness _ property based on georgi s naive dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the power counting will not be correct .",
    "the basic assumption of _ naturalness _ is that once the appropriate dimensional scale has been extracted using `` naive dimensional analysis '' proposed by georgi and manohar @xcite , the remaining dimensionless coefficients should all remain of order unity .",
    "if the naturalness assumption is valid , then the effective lagrangian can be truncated within a reasonable error .",
    "notice that there is no general proof of the naturalness property , since we do not know how to derive effective hadronic lagrangian from qcd .",
    "nevertheless , phenomenological studies support the validity of naturalness and naive power counting rules .",
    "the first attempt to make this model compatible with the naturalness property has been to relax the renormalizability requirement and include all non - linear terms which are allowed according to the underlying symmetry @xcite .",
    "then , one can fix the parameters of the model with some phenomenological input . in this fashion ,",
    "no reference to dirac - sea is invoked and one retains only the valence nucleon explicitly .",
    "all vacuum - loop effects will then be hidden in the new interaction terms added to the original model . here , we follow the same line of idea , namely relaxing the renormalizability condition by adding the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath4 to our model definition , but we keep the concept of the dirac - sea in a similar way to the non - renormalizable njl model @xcite . here",

    "in the presence of the nucleon dirac - sea , one does not need to constraint the form of potential from outset with @xmath39 in order to ensure the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the negative energy dirac - sea contribution can indeed generate a dynamical broken vacuum analogous to the njl model .",
    "due to spontaneous symmetry breaking the scalar mean field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value which is equal to the pion decay constant @xmath40 . here , the pions are the massless nambu - goldstone bosons .",

    "the vector - meson has been reported by many authors to be important for realization of the chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "we showed that if the vector - meson is completely decoupled from the quark matter @xmath80 above the critical deconfinement density , chiral phase transition can take place and its position depends on the given critical deconfinement density .",
    "we showed in order to be consistent with brown - rho scaling @xcite and vector - realization @xcite based on hidden - local symmetry , the critical deconfinement density must be bigger than @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the nuclear matter density . then the chiral restoration is first order and is coincident with the deconfinement density .",
