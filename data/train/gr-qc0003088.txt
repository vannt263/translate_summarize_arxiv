    "the driving force behind the theoretical studies in gravitational radiation is to predict and investigate the sources of gravitational waves that will be observed by interferometric ( geo600 , ligo , virgo , tama , lisa ) and bar ( allegro , auriga , explorer , nautilus ) detectors .",
    "the goal of these studies is not limited to facilitating the detection of signals but also to provide tools to extract as much information as possible about the physical nature of the sources .",
    "neutron stars have been pointed out as obvious source candidates , since one channel by which an oscillating neutron star looses energy is via the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "this radiation basically consists of a superposition of its characteristic oscillatory modes , which can be grouped into two families : i ) the fluid modes @xcite , which have a newtonian counterpart , but which through their coupling to the spacetime are damped because they now can emit gravitational waves .",
    "ii ) the spacetime modes @xcite , which have no newtonian counterpart , and which couple only weakly to the fluid .",
    "( in the odd parity case , they do not couple to the fluid at all ) .",
    "these modes usually are strongly damped , however , for ultra - relativistic stars , the spacetime curvature can be so strong that it can trap impinging gravitational waves .",
    "those `` trapped '' modes @xcite are quite long lived , since they only leak out slowly from inside the gravitational potential well created by the neutron star . for recent comprehensive reviews on oscillation modes of neutron stars and black holes ,",
    "see @xcite .    however , just knowing the different oscillation modes of a neutron star is not enough . to be able to detect and to interpret a signal in a gravitational wave detector , it is crucial to have accurate templates of the waveforms that result from astrophysical events , such as the formation of the neutron star after the collapse of a progenitor star at the end point of nuclear burning . to that purpose ,",
    "two ingredients are necessary .",
    "firstly , one has to have initial data that represent a realistic stage of the astrophysical system under consideration .",
    "secondly , one needs a numerical evolution code that can evolve these initial data in a stable and accurate way .",
    "it is only by fully nonlinear simulations that accurate waveforms of oscillating neutron stars after core collapse or binary merger can be obtained .",
    "therefore it is a major goal of several groups to push the further development of nonlinear evolution codes .",
    "the biggest obstacle , however , that still prevents one from obtaining accurate results , is the enormous computational expenditure to solve the full set of einstein equations in 3d .",
    "even modest resolutions easily exceed the capabilities of the largest and fastest present day computers .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have some alternative methods which require less computing power but still give valuable physical insight .",
    "one of them is perturbation theory . in the non - rotating case , due to the spherical background ,",
    "one can completely separate off the angular dependence , and the evolution problem boils down to the integration of 1d wave equations . slowly rotating stars",
    "can still be treated in 1d as long as the deformation due to rotation is negligible .",
    "but for rapidly rotating neutron stars , the spherical symmetry is broken , and one can only separate off the azimuthal angular dependence .",
    "hence the problem becomes 2d , which is nevertheless still numerically tractable .",
    "the results from those linear evolutions are expected to give accurate waveforms in the range where the neutron star oscillates only weakly .",
    "furthermore , they can be used as testbeds for the nonlinear calculations .",
    "indeed , recent results of nonlinear evolutions have confirmed the existence of the various modes predicted by linear perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the evolution of polar perturbations of non - rotating stars has been first addressed by allen et al .",
    "@xcite . in their formulation",
    "they describe the oscillations with three coupled wave equations , two for the metric perturbations in and outside the star , and one for the fluid inside the star .",
    "the evolution of various initial data have shown that generic initial data can indeed excite some of the stellar modes such as the @xmath1-mode , some @xmath2-modes and the first @xmath3-mode .    in this paper",
    "we rederive the perturbation equations using the ( 3 + 1 ) or adm - form @xcite of the einstein equations .",
    "these equations are much better suited for the numerical initial value problem , since they immediately yield a hyperbolic evolution system provided that a suitable gauge has been chosen , whereas the original field equations contain mixed time and space derivatives .",
    "it is only by the introduction of new variables that those equations can be cast into a well suited form .",
    "the adm - formalism has already been addressed by moncrief @xcite , where it was used to derive a hamiltonian gauge invariant formulation of the perturbation equations .",
    "albeit preferable from a conceptual point of view , since they are independent of any gauge , those equations do not prove particularly useful for numerical evolutions .",
    "our starting point therefore are the field equations written as a set of evolution equations for the metric and the extrinsic curvature of a 3-dimensional spatial hypersurface , together with the constraint equations , which have to be satisfied at every instance of time .    as an immediate consequence of using the adm - formalism",
    ", it follows that it is always possible to eliminate the fluid variables and thus to write down the evolution equations in terms of metric quantities only .",
    "this has already been shown by chandrasekhar and ferrari @xcite for the diagonal gauge and by ipser and price @xcite for the regge - wheeler gauge . however , from our formalism it is clear that this feature is independent of the chosen gauge .",
    "after having expanded the equations in spherical harmonics , we will choose the regge - wheeler gauge as the basis of further investigations .",
    "due to the spherical harmonics the equations are independent of the azimuthal order @xmath4 and can be divided into two uncoupled sets according to their behavior under parity transformation . the polar or",
    "even parity equations transform as @xmath5 , whereas the axial or odd parity equations as @xmath6 .",
    "our main focus will be the polar perturbations , nevertheless , due to their simplicity , we also present the axial equations in the adm - form . the derivation of the polar equations is much more involved , because the `` raw '' forms lead to numerical instabilities at the origin due to indefinite expressions , which is a well known consequence of using spherical coordinates .",
    "we are therefore forced to recast the polar equations into a form that is well behaved at the origin .    having forged the equations into a form that yields stable evolutions for polytropic equations of state , we face a new instability close to the stellar surface when we try to switch to realistic equations of state . in this paper",
    "we use a quite recent equation of state , called mpa @xcite . yet",
    ", this instability is not a consequence of just this particular equation of state , it will occur for any realistic equation of state . as we shall show , the instability results from the behavior of the sound speed at the neutron drip point , where the equation of state suddenly becomes very soft .",
    "this is accompanied by a sharp drop of the sound speed , which can give rise to a numerical instability if the spatial grid resolution is chosen too low .",
    "however , by increasing the resolution this instability will eventually vanish . in the non - rotating case ,",
    "having to resort to higher resolutions does not present too great an obstacle , since the equations are 1d wave equations .",
    "however , this instability presumably also occurs for rotating stars , where the equations are 2d , and the required resolution in order to obtain stable evolutions might stretch the computing times to unacceptably large values .",
    "therefore we devise a coordinate transformation of the radial coordinate inside the star , which enables stable evolutions for any spatial resolution .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we derive the relevant equations .",
    "section iii is devoted to a discussion of the boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "iv we briefly comment on the construction of initial data , and in sec .  v we present results for polytropic equations of state . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we discuss the instability associated with the use of realistic equations of state , and we present the coordinate transformation that removes it .",
    "conclusions are briefly presented in sec .",
    "we adopt the metric signature ( @xmath7+++ ) and work in geometric units with @xmath8 .",
    "spacetime and spatial indices are denoted by greek and latin letters , respectively .",
    "derivatives with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath0 are sometimes denoted by a prime and derivatives with respect to the time coordinate @xmath9 by an overdot .",
    "the background geometry of a non - rotating , spherically symmetric star is given by the line element @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "we model the star as a perfect fluid whose energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath13 with @xmath2 denoting the pressure , @xmath14 the energy density , and @xmath15 the 4-velocity of the fluid . in the fluid rest frame @xmath15",
    "has only one non - vanishing component @xmath16 .",
    "einstein s equations @xmath17 and the conservation equations @xmath18 yield the following three independent structure equations for the four unknown @xmath19 and @xmath14 :    [ toveqns ] @xmath20    we will refer to those equations as tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations , although they are usually written in terms of the gravitational mass function @xmath4 , which is related to @xmath21 through @xmath22 to fully determine this system of equations , an equation of state must be supplemented . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to barotropic equations of state , where the pressure is a function of the energy density alone : @xmath23 in particular , we will use either a polytropic equation of state in form of @xmath24 or a tabulated realistic zero temperature equation of state . to obtain the stellar model",
    ", we have to integrate the tov equations together with the equation of state from the center up to the point where the pressure @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "this then defines the surface @xmath25 of the star . from birkhoff theorem",
    "it follows that the exterior vacuum region of the star is described by the schwarzschild metric with the mass parameter @xmath26 .",
    "let us recall that the general line element , when written in the adm - form , reads @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are lapse function , shift vector , and spatial metric , respectively .",
    "comparing the adm - metric with the background metric reveals that the background shift @xmath31 vanishes and the background lapse function is @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , the extrinsic curvature of constant @xmath9 slices vanishes , since the background metric is static .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath33 now be the perturbations of the lapse function and the ( covariant ) shift vector , and let @xmath34 denote the perturbations of the spatial metric . the line element describing the perturbations to the background",
    "metric then reads @xmath35 the perturbations of the energy - momentum tensor can be written in terms of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , which are the ( eulerian ) perturbations of the energy density @xmath14 , pressure @xmath2 , and ( covariant ) 4-velocity @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we assume the equation of state to hold for both the unperturbed and perturbed configurations ( isentropic perturbations ) , therefore the perturbations @xmath36 and @xmath37 are related through @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the sound speed inside the fluid .",

    "the constraints then can serve as a means to compute the matter perturbations @xmath36 and @xmath53 .",
    "we should stress that the possibility to completely describe the oscillations of neutron stars with spacetime variables only is a general feature of the perturbation equations and does not depend on any specific gauge choice .",
    "due to the spherical symmetry of the background , we can eliminate the angular dependence of the perturbation equations by expanding them into spherical tensor harmonics .",
    "those tensor harmonics can be divided into two subsets that behave differently under parity transformation . under space reflection",
    "the _ even parity _ or _ polar _ harmonics change sign according to @xmath5 , whereas the _ odd parity _ or _ axial _ harmonics transform like @xmath6 . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the number that labels the multipole of the spherical harmonics @xmath55 . because of the spherical symmetry",
    ", the axial and polar equations are decoupled and degenerate with respect to the azimuthal number @xmath4 .    without picking a specific gauge",
    ", the metric perturbations can be expanded using the tensor harmonics given first by regge and wheeler @xcite in the following way ( symmetric components are denoted by an asterisk ) :",
    "@xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 the notation has been chosen such that the coefficients @xmath60 represent the _ scalar _ parts of @xmath61 , namely @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , whereas the @xmath64 stand for the _ vector _ components @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "lastly , the @xmath67 represent the _ tensor _ components @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "note that this expansion includes both polar and axial harmonics .",
    "the latter are represented by @xmath70 and @xmath71 with respective coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath42 will be expanded as @xmath74 here , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the axial coefficients .",
    "last not least , we need the matter variables @xmath77 the sum over the multipoles starts from @xmath78 , since we are only interested in perturbations which are associated with the emission of gravitational radiation . besides , the non - radiative multipoles @xmath79 and @xmath80 would have to be treated in a different way .    using the above expansions",
    ", we obtain 12 evolution equations for the coefficients of the 3-metric @xmath34 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath42 .",
    "however , it is clear that this set can not be used for the evolution , for we have not specified any gauge yet . within perturbation theory ,",
    "picking a specific gauge usually means to define a gauge vector @xmath81 and transform the metric perturbations according to @xmath82 in our case , however , we follow the spirit of the adm - formalism , that is we pick the gauge by prescribing the coefficients of lapse @xmath28 and shift @xmath33 , for which we do not have any evolution equations . yet",
    ", this is not enough as we shall see . to fully fix the gauge",
    ", we also have to impose certain constraints on the initial data .",
    "the most common gauge is the regge - wheeler gauge @xcite , which can be obtained by setting a certain number of metric perturbation coefficients to zero . translating this into the adm - formalism means to choose shift and lapse in such a way that for initial data which obey the regge - wheeler gauge , the evolution will preserve it .",
    "regge and wheeler have chosen their gauge such that the metric coefficients @xmath83 , and @xmath84 vanish . by choosing shift and lapse as ( from now on",
    "we omit the indices @xmath54 and @xmath4 ) @xmath85 we obtain the following evolution equations for the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath73 : @xmath87 in addition the evolution equation for the extrinsic curvature component @xmath88 depends only on @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , only for initial data satisfying @xmath91 _ and _ @xmath92 , the evolution equations guarantee the vanishing of those coefficients throughout the whole evolution .",
    "hence , the regge - wheeler gauge does not only impose constraints on the initial metric perturbations but also on the extrinsic curvature perturbations .",
    "the vanishing of the coefficient @xmath88 is a crucial feature of the regge - wheeler gauge and has to be imposed on the initial data .",
    "this is in contradiction with the statement of andersson et al .",
    "@xcite , where the authors claim that there are no constraints on the odd or even parity nature of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "this is not true , since the vanishing of @xmath88 _ must _ be ensured on the initial slice , otherwise the evolution _ can not _ be performed in the regge - wheeler gauge . for data with non - vanishing @xmath88",
    ", we would have @xmath93 , which is incompatible with the regge - wheeler gauge , because it would lead to a non - vanishing @xmath89 even if @xmath89 was initially set to zero . therefore the initial data presented in @xcite for two colliding neutron stars are not adequate for an evolution code which makes use of the regge - wheeler gauge , since the coefficient @xmath94 in eqs .",
    "( 82 ) of @xcite ( which corresponds to our @xmath88 ) does not vanish .",
    "we will discuss the issue of constructing initial data in more detail in section [ sec : init ] .",
    "having switched to the regge - wheeler gauge , we are left with evolution equations for the three metric variables @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , and all the extrinsic curvature variables @xmath98 save @xmath88 .",
    "( in the more common notation of regge and wheeler @xcite , it is @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) .",
    "we now split the equations with respect to their behavior under parity transformation .",
    "let us first focus our attention to the axial case .",
    "if in the expansions and we use new variables    @xmath102    we obtain the following set of evolution equations :    [ axial ] @xmath103    and one constraint equation : @xmath104 from the conservation law @xmath105 , it follows that @xmath106 which means that axial gravitational waves do not couple to the stellar fluid .",
    "of course , this does not mean that there can not be any axial modes at all , in fact , there exists a whole spectrum of axial spacetime modes , which is quite similar the polar spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is only the fluid modes that are missing .",
    "the three evolution equations can be combined to yield a single wave equation for the metric perturbation @xmath107 , or better for the variable @xmath108 which completely describes the dynamical evolution of axial perturbations : @xmath109 herein , @xmath110 denotes the tortoise coordinate defined by @xmath111 in the exterior , where @xmath2 and @xmath14 vanish and @xmath112 , eq .   reduces to the well known regge - wheeler equation @xcite .      for the polar case",
    "we have only two dynamical metric perturbations @xmath113 and @xmath114 , since the lapse @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath113 , and the only non - vanishing component @xmath116 of the shift is proportional to @xmath117 . to obtain the relevant equations , we again choose a somewhat different expansion .",
    "for the metric we use @xmath118 and for the extrinsic curvature @xmath119 the expansion of the matter variables reads @xmath120 of course , these expansions are to be understood as sums over all @xmath54 and @xmath4 , analogous to the expansions and .",
    "it is only through this particular choice of expansion coefficients ( e.g. in @xmath28 , @xmath63 and @xmath121 ) that we obtain a system of equations that can be numerically integrated in a quite straightforward and  this is the main point  in a stable way .",
    "another consequence of this decomposition is that it gives some physical meaning to the metric perturbations @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "from eq .  , we can see that @xmath123 represents the conformal part of the spatial perturbation @xmath34 , for if we set @xmath124 , the metric is conformally flat .",
    "obviously , @xmath122 itself then represents the deviation from conformal flatness .",
    "finally , we should note that this decomposition is quite similar to the one used by allen et al .",
    "their variables @xmath125 and @xmath126 are related to ours as follows : @xmath127 and @xmath128 .    in order to avoid numerical problems at the origin",
    ", we have to replace @xmath129 by the following quantity @xmath130 in this way , we obtain a system of five coupled evolution equations , which are of first order in time and second order in space .",
    "there are two equations for the metric variables",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath123 and three more for the extrinsic curvature variables @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 :    [ fosys ] @xmath134      \\end{split }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath135\\\\        & \\qquad\\qquad + 8\\pi e^{2\\nu}{\\left(}1 - c^2_s{\\right)}\\rho      \\end{split}\\\\      \\label{k2 }      { \\frac{\\partial { k_2}}{\\partial { t } } } & =      e^{2\\nu-2\\lam } { \\left(}r { \\frac{\\partial { s}}{\\partial { r } } } + { \\left(}2r\\nu ' + 1{\\right)}s      + 2\\frac{\\nu'}{r}t{\\right)}\\ , .    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we could easily convert this system into a first order system both in time and space by adding another two evolution equations for the first derivatives @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "however , the form of the first four equations ",

    "we have made extensive use of the computer algebra program maple v in order to avoid possible mistakes .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that our equations and our numerical results agree with those of allen et al .",
    "there are three boundaries we have to take care of : the origin , the surface , and the outer boundary of the numerical grid , which lies somewhere outside the star .    at the origin @xmath164 we have to demand all variables to be regular . from taylor expansion around @xmath164",
    ", we can infer the analytic behavior of the various variables .",
    "close to the origin , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , for instance , are both proportional to @xmath165 .    at the outer boundary",
    ", we impose the sommerfeld boundary condition , i.e.  we require the waves to be purely outgoing . if computational time does not matter , we can even put this boundary so far away that any contamination that enters the grid from there has not enough time to travel to the region where we extract the signal .",
    "the third boundary is the surface of the star at @xmath166 , which is formally defined by the vanishing of the total pressure @xmath167 .",

    "we can obtain the boundary condition for the wave equation .",

    ", if one sets @xmath180 .    for polytropic equations of state ,",
    "it is always @xmath181 at the surface of the star , hence the evolution equations and automatically lead to the right boundary conditions .",
    "for realistic equations of state , the sound speed at the surface should be that of iron , which is very small compared to the sound speed inside the core , where it might reach almost the speed of light for very relativistic stellar models . for practical purposes , in these cases",
    "we just might as well set @xmath182 .",
    "of course , this analysis does not hold for constant density models , but those are not considered in this paper , anyway .",
    "let us now turn to the junction conditions at the surface of the star .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath14 and @xmath41 go to zero when approaching the stellar surface @xmath166 .",

    "if we let the subscripts @xmath184 and @xmath185 represent the values for the interior and the exterior , respectively , we deduce from eq .   that for the second derivative of @xmath123 across the surface , the following relation has to hold : @xmath186 from condition",
    ", it follows that the values of @xmath139 at the surface depends on the value of @xmath187 at this point .",
    "as already discussed above , for polytropic equations of state , we have @xmath188 at the surface .",
    "however , @xmath187 does not necessarily vanish , instead we have the following relation @xmath189 which shows that the behavior of @xmath187 critically depends on the value of the polytropic index @xmath190 .",
    "we can distinguish three different cases .",
    "for @xmath191 , we have @xmath192 , for @xmath193 , we have @xmath194 const . , whereas for @xmath195 , we have @xmath196 !    this is somewhat disturbing , since for the boundary condition this would mean that @xmath197 , unless the expression in brackets vanishes . however , this is not automatically guaranteed !",
    "interestingly , the boundary condition for @xmath147 is harmless for all values of @xmath190 , since @xmath198 is always bounded .",
    "but , of course , in eq .",
    ", we have to use @xmath139 , which we have to compute from @xmath147 using @xmath199 again , we obtain an infinite value when @xmath200 , unless @xmath147 vanishes at the surface .",
    "however , as with eq .  , the boundary condition does not guarantee the vanishing of @xmath147 , even if @xmath147 is initially set to zero .",
    "the reason for this peculiar behavior of @xmath139 is that in the @xmath201 case , the eulerian description breaks down at the surface , which is a direct consequence of @xmath187 becoming infinite . in this case",
    ", a lagrangian description of the fluid perturbations would be much more appropriate , since for any polytropic equation of state , the lagrangian energy density perturbation always vanishes at the surface , because of the vanishing of the lagrangian pressure perturbation .",
    "what then happens to the eulerian density perturbation ?",
    "by definition , the eulerian density perturbation @xmath52 is the difference between the total energy density and the background density @xmath14 at the same location @xmath0 , whereas the lagrangian density perturbation @xmath202 measures the density change in a fluid element that is displaced by some amount @xmath168 .",
    "it is through taylor expansion to linear order that we obtain the connection between the lagrangian and eulerian perturbations : @xmath203 but of course , for the @xmath200 case this expression is ill - defined at the surface , since the second term diverges .",
    "it is then clear that the eulerian perturbation @xmath36 has to become infinite , too , in order to compensate for the blow up of @xmath187 and to yield a vanishing lagrangian perturbation @xmath204 .",
    "the whole discussion seems somewhat irrelevant , since we have seen that the equations can be written in terms of metric quantities only .",
    "however , we have to compute the second derivative of @xmath123 , which , as can be seen from eq .  , depends on @xmath139 . in the @xmath201 case",
    ", we therefore must have a blow up of @xmath205 at the surface .",
    "of course , this is very troublesome for the numerical discretization , and even for @xmath193 , we still have a discontinuity in @xmath205 , which can spoil the second order convergence of the numerical discretization scheme .",
    "the numerical evolutions indeed confirm the above analysis . by computing @xmath139 with the aid of the hamiltonian constraint",
    ", we find that for polytropic stellar models with @xmath200 , @xmath139 tends to blow up at the stellar surface . for @xmath191",
    ", we have @xmath206 at the surface , whereas for @xmath193 , we obtain a finite value @xcite .",
    "to obtain physically valid initial data , we have to solve the constraint equations and .",
    "as is well known , there is no unique way to do so , for those equations are underdetermined , and therefore one always has to make some additional assumptions about the geometry of the initial slice .",
    "the simplest way is to choose time symmetric initial data , since in this case the momentum constraints can be satisfied trivially by setting all extrinsic curvature variables to zero , and we only have to solve the hamiltonian constraint . of course , time symmetric data",
    "are somewhat unphysical , since they represent a stage of a physical system which had an arbitrary amount of incoming radiation in the past .",
    "nevertheless , they can give valuable insight into the behavior of the system under consideration .",
    "in general , all conceivable initial data for neutron star oscillations fall into two basic categories , or combinations thereof .",
    "first , we can assume the star being initially unperturbed .",
    "in the exterior vacuum region , we then can arbitrarily prescribe some metric perturbations representing a gravitational wave , which travels towards the star and eventually excites it to oscillations . the most convenient way to do so",
    "is to prescribe the initial zerilli function @xmath154 and its time derivative @xmath163 , and to compute @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath131 , and @xmath133 through eqs .  .",
    "in this way , we have initial data that automatically satisfy the constraints without having to solve any differential equation .",
    "the other possibility is to prescribe some fluid perturbations inside the star and then use the constraints to solve for the associated metric perturbations .",
    "as is well known , the matter distribution does not uniquely fix the metric , since we can always superpose some additional gravitational waves .",
    "it is therefore not clear at all what would represent `` true '' physically realistic initial data .",
    "a quite common procedure is to construct conformally flat initial data @xcite . in our case",
    ", this amounts to setting @xmath207 in the hamiltonian constraint and solving for @xmath208 for a given initial fluid perturbation @xmath209 .",
    "interestingly , the thus obtained initial data do not excite any of the spacetime modes to a significant extent , whereas initial data with the same fluid perturbation @xmath209 , but with @xmath210 and @xmath211 , can show large @xmath3-mode excitations . in fig .  1",
    ", we compare the wave signals of these two cases for time symmetric initial data . in the case where we set @xmath212 , there is no @xmath3-mode signal at all , and the waveform consists of pure fluid oscillations . in the other case",
    ", we can see a burst of gravitational radiation , which quickly damps away through the first @xmath3-mode .",
    "the final fluid ringing then coincides with the @xmath213 case .",
    "this shows that the presence of @xmath3-modes is not a generic feature of neutron star oscillations .",
    "they are only excited by a special subset of initial data .",
    "the open question now is whether or not they will show up in a real wave signal .",
    "andersson and kokkotas @xcite have shown that by extracting the frequencies and damping times of the @xmath1-mode and the first @xmath3-mode in a gravitational wave signal , one can obtain important information such as mass and radius of the neutron star .",
    "these data , in turn , can then be used to restrict the possible equations of state .",
    "of course , this method stands and falls with the presence of the @xmath3-modes in the wave signal .",
    "but as we have seen , it could well be that @xmath3-modes do not play a significant role at all . in a subsequent paper @xcite , we will investigate the excitations of neutron star oscillations by means of particle scattering , which will show that the @xmath3-modes can only be excited by extremely relativistic particles .",
    "let us now focus on initial data which are not time symmetric .",
    "in this case , we also have to solve the momentum constraints . here , too",
    ", we have some additional freedom in specifying the extrinsic curvature . for instance we can choose tr@xmath214 , which is equivalent to setting @xmath215 or , equivalently because of eq .  ,",
    "@xmath216 we then can substitute @xmath131 in eq .   and obtain thus two coupled differential equations for the remaining unknowns @xmath132 and @xmath133 . for given fluid perturbations @xmath144 and @xmath145 , the momentum constraints yield a unique solution .    before presenting the numerical results",
    ", we would like to comment on the applicability of the lichnerowicz - york approach @xcite for the construction of initial data for neutron star perturbations , which was used in @xcite . stated in a somewhat crude way , this method consists in decomposing the six degrees of freedom of the extrinsic curvature into its trace tr@xmath131 ( 1 dof ) , a transverse trace free part @xmath217 ( 2 dofs ) , and a trace free longitudinal part @xmath218(3 dofs ) .",
    "since the momentum constraints consist only of three equations with three source functions @xmath219 , which describe the matter distribution , only 3 dofs are fixed , whereas the remaining ones are freely specifiable .",
    "the simplest way is to set tr@xmath220 , i.e.  the extrinsic curvature is purely longitudinal .",
    "it can thus be written in terms of a vector potential with three independent components , for which the momentum constraints provide a unique solution once the sources @xmath219 and appropriate boundary conditions have been specified .",
    "if the extrinsic curvature is first decomposed into spherical harmonics , this procedure still works . for the polar part , we then have four components and two constraint equations , i.e.  only two components can be freely specified . here , too , by assuming tr@xmath221 ,",
    "we can write the remaining longitudinal part in terms of a vector potential with two polar components . solving the constraint equations with non - vanishing sources @xmath219 will yield nonzero values for those component , and therefore all four polar components of the extrinsic curvature will in general have nonzero values , either .",
    "but this is contradiction with the regge - wheeler gauge , which requires the component @xmath222 to vanish .",
    "this could only be accomplished by setting one component of the vector potential to zero . however",
    ", this is not possible , since both components are already fixed by the constraint equations , and in general non - vanishing .",
    "hence , if we want our initial data to be conform to the regge - wheeler gauge , we have to have @xmath223 , and therefore we can not have both tr@xmath224 and @xmath225 . by choosing tr@xmath224 ,",
    "we already have used up all degrees of freedom to fix the extrinsic curvature components , since we have to set @xmath223 , too .",
    "our actual goal was , by using the adm - formalism , to obtain the evolution equations in a hyperbolic first order form .",
    "however , due to numerical problems at the origin , we were forced to modify those equations in such a way that the resulting set is more or less equivalent to the set of wave equations for the variables @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath147 .",
    "thus , from the computational point of view , there is no point in sticking to the first order system , since the wave equations can be numerically integrated in a much faster way .",
    "also , we will not explicitly integrate the fluid equations , since we can eliminate @xmath139 in eq .   by means of the hamiltonian constraint .    for the numerical evolution",
    ", we therefore use eqs .   and in the interior , whereas in the exterior we use eqs .   and with @xmath139",
    "set to zero .",
    "of course , in the exterior we could try to switch from @xmath122 and @xmath123 to the zerilli function @xmath154 .",
    "we thus would have to integrate only one wave equation , and from the resulting waveforms , we could easily read off the emitted gravitational energy , since the radiation power is proportional to the square of @xmath163 .    unfortunately , this causes numerical problems , because at the seam , we would have to compute @xmath154 and its derivatives from @xmath122 and @xmath123 and vice versa .",
    "however , in order to obtain a correct value of @xmath154 , it is crucial that @xmath122 and @xmath123 satisfy the hamiltonian constraint . on the other hand @xmath122 and",
    "@xmath123 satisfy the hamiltonian constraint by construction , at least up to discretization errors , when directly computed from @xmath154 through eqs .  .",
    "at the seam somewhere outside the star , where we switch from @xmath122 and @xmath123 to @xmath154 , we will always have some violation of the hamiltonian constraint , thus the computed zerilli function @xmath154 will not be quite correct",
    ". if we then go back and compute @xmath122 and @xmath123 from the just obtained value of @xmath154 , they will differ significantly from their original values , since now they suddenly satisfy the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this mismatching at the seam gives rise to additional reflections , which rapidly amplify inside the star and cause the numerical code to crash after a few dynamical time scales .",
    "there is another point we would like to mention .",
    "when evolved with the zerilli equation , the amplitude of an outgoing wave remains constant for large @xmath0 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath122 , however , the amplitude of @xmath123 grows linearly with @xmath0 . when computing @xmath154 from @xmath122 and @xmath123 by means of formula , this growth has to cancel , what is indeed the case when @xmath122 and @xmath123 exactly satisfy the hamiltonian constraint . if not , @xmath154 will also start to grow for large @xmath0 .",
    "but this is what happens , since numerically @xmath122 and @xmath123 do not satisfy the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "it is predominantly the high frequency components that get amplified the most strongly .",
    "unfortunately , this can lead to quite rough waveforms for @xmath154 , while those for @xmath122 and @xmath123 look perfectly smooth . by increasing the resolution ,",
    "this amplification will decrease , but the resolution has to be quite high in order to obtain accurate results .",
    "the most practical way to obtain a quite reliable zerilli function , therefore , is not to completely switch to the zerilli function in the exterior region , but to additionally evolve @xmath154 together with @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "that is , close to the surface of the star we construct @xmath154 from @xmath122 and @xmath123 by means of formula and then use the zerilli equation to independently evolve @xmath154 parallel to @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "of course , this amounts to the additional computational expenditure of evolving an extra wave equation , but we get rewarded by obtaining much more accurate results .    to discretize the wave equations",
    ", we use the explicit second order leap - frog scheme .",
    "if the equations are correctly implemented , the numerical violation of the constraints should converge to zero in second order . by monitoring the hamiltonian constraint in the exterior ,",
    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "of course , as mentioned above , for polytropes with @xmath226 , the stellar surface can reduce the convergence down to first order .",
    "we should make one final note concerning the numerical treatment of the origin @xmath164 .",
    "it is well known that in radial coordinates , the equations usually show a singular behavior close to the origin . moreover",
    ", taylor expansion around the origin shows that the equations admit two kinds of solutions , a regular and a divergent one . on physical grounds",
    ", one usually rejects the divergent solution . for the evolution ,",
    "it is crucial that the numerical scheme preserves the regularity condition and suppresses the divergent solution .",
    "we have chosen the dynamical variables such that the only singular terms are the ones proportional to @xmath227 .",
    "the regularity condition requires all the perturbation variables to vanish at the origin , however , even for @xmath78 the equations can not be numerically evolved with a time step size @xmath228 close to the maximal allowed time step size @xmath229 , which follows from the cfl - condition @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the grid spacing in the @xmath0-coordinate and @xmath232 the largest propagation speed , because the presence of the divergent @xmath227-terms causes the scheme to become unstable at the origin . only by decreasing @xmath228",
    "can stability be reinforced .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath54 , @xmath228 has to be so small that it prevents one from obtaining numerical results within a reasonable time frame .",
    "we therefore propose a different way that allows stable evolutions with @xmath228 close to @xmath229 for all values of @xmath54 . instead of having the boundary conditions located",
    "exactly at @xmath164 , we move it @xmath233 grid points to the right , i.e.  at @xmath234 , we impose @xmath235 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath233 depends on @xmath54 in the following simple way : @xmath236 .",
    "the numerical experiments and a detailed stability analysis @xcite have shown that with this little trick , we can indeed obtain stable and second order convergent evolutions for arbitrary values of @xmath54 with a courant number of about @xmath237 .",
    "results concerning the evolution of various initial data have already been presented in @xcite .",
    "since the authors only focused on a single polytropic stellar model with a central density of @xmath238g/@xmath239 , we would like to consider three more models , one being less relativistic and the others being more relativistic",
    ". the physical parameters of the models are given in table 1 .",
    "all results presented are for @xmath78",
    ". results for more stellar models and for other values of @xmath54 can be found in @xcite .    as initial data , we choose a narrow time symmetric gravitational wave pulse , centered at @xmath240 km , where we prescribe @xmath123 to have a gaussian shape , and use the hamiltonian constraint to compute @xmath122 .",
    "the numerical resolution is 500 grid points inside the star .",
    "the resulting waveforms for the different models are shown in fig .",
    "2 . using a logarithmic scale , we plot the modulus of the zerilli function , extracted at @xmath241 km .",
    "the three waveforms clearly have quite different features . for the least relativistic model 1 ( upper panel ) , there is no @xmath3-mode signal at all , and the fall - off , which immediately follows the reflected wave pulse at about @xmath242ms , shows more a tail - like behavior . at @xmath243ms",
    "it merges into the fluid ringing , which is dominated by the @xmath1-mode .",
    "this is a somewhat unexpected result , since a direct mode calculation reveals that for this model there do exist @xmath3-modes , which should show up in the waveform .",
    "however , even the first @xmath3-mode has a quite large imaginary part ( @xmath244 = 0.305 + 0.24i ) , which results from the model being less compact .",
    "thus , the @xmath3-modes get buried in the tail - like fall - off .",
    "the more compact and therefore more relativistic the stellar model is , the less damped are the @xmath3-modes , and they should eventually dominate over the tail - like fall - off .",
    "this is the case for model 2 ( middle panel ) , which is quite close to the stability limit . here , instead of the tail - like fall - off",
    ", we now can see the ring - down of the first @xmath3-mode ( @xmath244 = 0.256 + 0.085i ) . still",
    ", it is much more strongly damped than the fluid modes , which therefore dominate the late time part .",
    "model 3 ( lower panel ) , which is unstable with respect to radial oscillations , is compact enough to allow the existence of trapped modes . because of their comparatively weak damping",
    ", we can not have a clear cut discrimination between the two ring - down phases , i.e.  at first the @xmath3-modes and then the fluid modes .",
    "instead , the signal consists of a mixture of both the trapped and the fluid modes .",
    "nevertheless , the trapped modes dominate in early times , which can be seen from the fourier transform in the upper panel of fig .",
    "3 . in the lower panel",
    ", we have taken the fourier transform at much later times , where the most strongly damped trapped modes have damped away and the fluid modes prevail . still , the first two trapped modes are present in the spectrum",
    ".    however , there is still one feature present in the wave signal for model 3 , which was also present in previous evolutions of the axial modes for very compact stars , but which apparently has not been noticed before ( see e.g.  fig .  4 of @xcite and fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "if , in the wave signal , we determine the frequency and damping time of the very first ring - down ( from @xmath245ms to about @xmath246ms ) , we find that they do not match to any of the quasi - normal modes associated with this particular stellar model .",
    "instead , they are almost identical with the complex frequency of the first quasi - normal mode of an equal mass black hole !",
    "how is that ?    for black hole spacetimes , the quasinormal modes are derived from the regge - wheeler potential in the axial case and the zerilli potential in the polar case .",
    "both potentials exhibit a maximum at about @xmath247 .",
    "for ordinary neutron stars the surface lies usually at a radius larger than @xmath248 , therefore these peaks do not exist for those stars .",
    "however , for ultra - compact stars these peaks can lie outside .",
    "any axial or polar incoming gravitational wave packet has to cross the corresponding peak before penetrating the neutron star .",
    "while trying to cross this peak , a large fraction of the wave will be scattered off , which in the black hole spacetime gives rise to the quasinormal ring - down , but since the situation is now almost identical for the neutron star spacetime , this associated ring - down will have black - hole characteristics .",
    "since inside the star , the local speed of light @xmath249 is largely reduced , it takes a while for the remaining wave packet to be reflected , and this is gives rise to the strong increase in the signal at about @xmath250ms . here",
    ", the trapped wave packet finally finds its way out again , and it is only from thereon , that the wave signal consists of the proper fluid and spacetime modes .",
    "( it is also from this time when we have taken the fourier transformation to obtain the upper spectrum in fig.3 . if we had included the first ring - down , this spectrum would have sat on top of a large broad peak . ) for less compact stars the local light speed inside the star is higher , and therefore the wave packet gets reflected much earlier , making the black - hole - like ring - down phase much shorter .",
    "we should mention that this ring - down phenomenon for very compact stars is much more pronounced for larger values of @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "so far we have used polytropic equations of state , which are quite decent approximations to realistic equations of state as far as the bulk features of neutron stars like mass and radius are concerned .",
    "however , it is in particular the fluid oscillations that are very sensitive to local changes in the equation of state , which are due to the different behavior of the neutron star matter under varying pressure .",
    "it is therefore important to use realistic equations of state that take into account the underlying microphysics which determines the state of the matter as a function of pressure and temperature .",
    "realistic equations of state can not be given in analytic terms over the whole pressure range inside the neutron star , hence they usually exist in tabulated form only .",
    "to solve the tov equations in this case , one has to interpolate between the given values in order to obtain the stellar model with continuous functions of radius @xmath0 . in the following ,",

    "this happens at about @xmath262 grid points inside the star , depending on the stellar model under consideration .",
    "hence , we have this strange fact that for low resolutions the numerical evolution tends to be unstable , whereas for resolutions high enough , the evolution is stable . we should stress that this happens only with the use of realistic equations of state .",
    "it does not happen for polytropic stellar models , even if the resolution is extremely low .",
    "further investigations show that the origin of this instability comes from the region close to the surface , where the sound speed has a sharp drop . in fig .",
    "4 we show the profile of the sound speed @xmath263 for a stellar model using eos mpa with a central density of @xmath264 g/@xmath239 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that at @xmath265 km , there is a local minimum of the sound speed , where it drops down to @xmath266 . for larger @xmath0",
    "we can see a series of much smaller dips , which is an artefact of the numerical spline interpolation between the tabulated points .",
    "but the dip at @xmath265 km is physical and is related to the neutron drip point , where the equation of state suddenly becomes very soft . since this occurs still in the low pressure regime , the dip is present for any realistic equation of state .",
    "it is indeed this dip in the sound speed that is responsible for the numerical instability , for if we remove it `` by hand '' , we obtain a stable evolution ! moreover ,",
    "the occurrence of the instability is independent of the actual formulation of the equations , since the terms that are responsible are the same in each case .",
    "but what are the `` bad '' terms ? by simply crossing out individual terms , we find that the culprits are those terms in the fluid equations , , or which are not multiplied by @xmath267 .",
    "these are the terms which remain when the sound speed goes to zero , i.e.  these which constitute the boundary conditions and . without these terms , the evolution would be stable for any resolution .",
    "the next question is then whether this instability is just a feature of our finite differencing scheme and does not appear for a different scheme .",
    "it turned out that the instability does indeed occur for all discretization schemes we have tried : the central difference scheme for the wave equations , a central difference scheme on staggered grids and the two - step lax - wendroff scheme both for the first order system of equations .",
    "of course , these are only explicit schemes , and we do not know whether switching to implicit schemes could be a remedy .",
    "however , in all above cases , the instability eventually vanishes when the resolution is increased above a certain threshold . for the central difference schemes ,",
    "this threshold is at about @xmath268 grid points , depending on the stellar model , whereas for the lax - wendroff scheme , the required minimum resolution in order to overcome the instability can even exceed @xmath269 grid points inside the star , which is clearly unacceptable .",
    "a more elaborate analysis of the nature of the instability can be found in @xcite .",
    "there it is shown on the basis of a simplified toy equation that the resolution needed in order to overcome the instability strongly depends on the location and depth of the dip in the sound speed .",
    "the closer to the surface and the deeper the dip , the higher the required resolution .",
    "since this resolution is only needed in a very tiny region close to the surface , it would be enough to just refine the grid in this region and use a coarser grid outside .",
    "this could be accomplished , for instance , by fixed mesh refinement , since this region is determined by the profile of the sound speed , which does not change throughout the evolution .",
    "however , we then would have to deal with the transition from the coarse grid to the fine grid and vice versa , which might be troublesome .",
    "another drawback is that for each different stellar model , we would need a different grid refinement , and it would be a matter of trial and error to find the appropriate refinements for a stable evolution .    yet",
    ", there is a better way out .",
    "we can try to find a new radial coordinate @xmath270 , which is related to the actual radial coordinate @xmath0 in such a way that an equidistant grid in @xmath270 would correspond to a grid in @xmath0 that becomes automatically denser in regions where the sound speed assumes small values .",
    "a simple relation between the grid spacings @xmath271 and @xmath231 that has the desired property is @xmath272 an equidistant discretization with a constant grid spacing @xmath271 would correspond to a coarse grid in @xmath0 for large values of @xmath41 , which becomes finer and finer as the sound speed @xmath41 decreases .    from the relation",
    ", we can immediately deduce the form of our new coordinate @xmath270 as a function of @xmath0 . by replacing the @xmath273 s by differentials",
    "we obtain @xmath274 or @xmath275 as a consequence , the derivatives transform as @xmath276 and @xmath277 from the last relation , we see that the thus defined coordinate transformation will transform the wave equation in such a way that the propagation speed with respect to the @xmath270-coordinate will be unity throughout the whole stellar interior .",
    "of course , we have to use relation with some caution , for if @xmath278 this transformation becomes singular . and",
    "this is what happens at the stellar surface .",
    "if , for instance , the profile of the sound speed is given in the form @xmath279 , where we have @xmath280 , we can find an analytic expression for @xmath270 @xmath281 which tells us that at the surface @xmath166 we obtain @xmath282 . in this case",
    ", the coordinate transformation seems to be quite useless , since numerically we can not deal with a grid that extends up to infinity .",
    "we would have to truncate it somewhere .",
    "but from a numerical point of view , this is not that bad , since going to infinity in the @xmath270-coordinate would correspond to an infinitely fine resolution in the @xmath0-coordinate at the stellar surface .",
    "but this is numerically impossible as well , so truncating the @xmath270-coordinate at some point means to define a maximal resolution in @xmath0 at the surface .",
    "however , this case usually does not happen . in all cases considered",
    ", @xmath283 has always a finite value .",
    "it should be noted that the above transformation is of the same kind as the definition of the tortoise coordinate @xmath110 in eq .  , which also leads to wave equations with unity propagation speed throughout the whole domain .",
    "thus , we may call @xmath270 a hydrodynamical tortoise coordinate .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath0-coordinate as a function of the @xmath270-coordinate for three different stellar models . from the curves ,",
    "it is clear that an equidistant grid spacing in @xmath270 will result in an equivalent spacing in @xmath0 that gets very dense towards the surface of the star , which means that this part gets highly resolved . and",
    "this is exactly what we need in order to overcome the instability and to obtain a decent accuracy .    to obtain the background data on the @xmath270-grid",
    ", we have to solve the tov equations with respect to @xmath270 .",
    "since we also need @xmath0 as a function of @xmath270 , we simultaneously solve eq .",
    "the transformed set of equations then reads :    [ tovx ] @xmath284    of course , this transformation is only defined in the stellar interior for the fluid equations , for it is only there that the propagation speed is the speed of sound ( apart from the factor @xmath151 ) . if we still wanted to use eq .",
    ", where in the interior @xmath123 plays the role of the fluid , we would have to switch from the @xmath270-grid in the interior to the @xmath0-grid in the exterior , which is somewhat inconvenient .",
    "it is therefore much more natural to explicitly include the fluid equation , which is defined in the interior only .",
    "thence , it is only eq .   which will be transformed according to the transformation , whereas we keep the wave equations for @xmath122 and @xmath123 as they are given in and .",
    "the transformed fluid part of the fluid equation reads @xmath285\\;.    \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the subscript @xmath270 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath270 .",
    "the last missing thing is the transformation of the boundary condition .",
    "unfortunately , we can not transform eq .   in a straightforward way , since at the surface it is @xmath278 , and therefore the transformation of the derivative @xmath286 is not defined .",
    "however , the inverse transformation can make sense if we note that if @xmath278 then any derivative with respect to @xmath270 has to vanish .",
    "this is in particular true for @xmath147 itself .",
    "thus , at the stellar surface @xmath166 , where the sound speed @xmath41 vanishes we impose the following boundary condition for @xmath147 : @xmath287 this corresponds to reflection at a loose end on the @xmath270-grid .    since we only transform the fluid equation and not the equations for the metric perturbations @xmath122 and",
    "@xmath123 , we have to simultaneously use two different grids : the @xmath270-grid in the interior for the fluid variable @xmath147 , and the @xmath0-grid both in the interior and exterior for the metric variables @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "because of the coupling , at each time step we have to interpolate @xmath147 from the @xmath270-grid onto the @xmath0-grid in order to update equation , and , vice versa , both @xmath122 and @xmath123 from the @xmath0-grid onto the @xmath270-grid in order to update equation .",
    "this can easily be accomplished by using spline interpolation .    in fig .",
    "6 we demonstrate the convergence of this new method using a stellar model based on the realistic eos mpa . for initial data similar to the ones used for fig .  2",
    ", we plot the evolution of a gaussian wave packet together with the evaluation of the hamiltonian constraint for three different spatial resolutions . by doubling the resolution ,",
    "the error in the hamiltonian constraint should decrease by a factor of 4 , if the scheme is of second order .",
    "conversely , the magnitude of the error should remain roughly constant , if for each doubling of the resolution , the error is multiplied by a factor of 4 .",
    "this has been done in fig .  6 , and one can clearly see that the magnitudes of the thus rescaled errors remain constant for the different resolutions . furthermore the scheme is stable since the error does not grow with time .",
    "the fluid modes have their largest amplitude in the region close to the surface .",
    "to obtain the correct mode frequencies in the power spectrum , it is important to have high resolution close to the surface of the star , and this is what is accomplished by our new coordinate @xmath270 . in fig .  7 , we show the power spectra of waveforms obtained from runs with different resolutions . as initial data , we chose a narrow fluid deflection at the center of the star together with @xmath124 . in this case , we suppressed any @xmath3-mode contribution .",
    "it is apparent that even for the quite moderate resolution of 50 grid points on the @xmath270-grid inside the star we obtain very accurate frequencies for the first couple of fluid modes . on the @xmath0-grid ,",
    "however , a resolution of 200 grid points is still not enough to obtain the same accuracy , and the peaks of the higher @xmath2-modes in the spectrum are still quite far off their true values .",
    "of course , these results were obtained with a polytropic equation of state , since otherwise we would not have been able to perform the evolution on the @xmath0-grid at all , because of the occurring instability .",
    "finally , we want to demonstrate the effectiveness of our coordinate transformation by evolving an initial perturbation for the mpa equation of state .",
    "we choose the central energy density to be @xmath288g/@xmath239 , yielding a stellar mass of @xmath289 .",
    "the resolution is n = 200 grid points , which , again , would be too low to yield a stable evolution using the @xmath0-coordinate .",
    "here we do not have any problems , the evolution is stable for _ any _ chosen resolution . in fig .",
    "8 , we show the power spectrum of the evolution of a sharp initial peak in the fluid perturbation @xmath147 , which leads to the excitation of a multitude of fluid modes . in the interval up to @xmath290khz",
    ", we can find 37 modes .",
    "the direct calculation of the first couple of modes with an eigenvalue code shows perfect agreement , which is demonstrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "8 . actually , the direct mode calculation is much more involved and time consuming than the evolution with a subsequent fourier transformation . even with a thousand grid points inside the star ,",
    "it is a matter of minutes to obtain an accurate fluid mode spectrum for stellar models with realistic equations of state . of course , with this method",
    "one can only obtain the real parts of the frequencies , the imaginary parts are too small to be determined .",
    "in this paper , we have derived , using the adm - formalism , the perturbation equations for non - rotating , spherically symmetric neutron star models with barotropic equations of state .",
    "we have shown how to choose shift and lapse and the initial data on the three dimensional initial slice in order to obtain the regge - wheeler gauge .",
    "we pointed out that not only some of the metric components but also one of the extrinsic curvature components has to vanish in order to preserve the regge - wheeler gauge throughout the evolution .    unfortunately , the equations that directly come out after the expansion in spherical tensor harmonics are not suited for the numerical treatment due to problems at the origin .",
    "we therefore had to introduce different variables that remove the singular structure of the `` raw '' equations . since the final system of equations in those variables is nothing else but a system of coupled wave equations written in first order form , it is therefore much more convenient to use instead the second order wave equations for the numerical evolution .",
    "those wave equations have already been previously derived by allen et al .",
    "@xcite in a different way .",
    "still , our formulation is quite useful because it facilitates the construction of initial data in terms of metric and extrinsic curvature perturbations .",
    "moreover , by introducing the adm - formalism for the derivation of the evolution equations of non - rotating neutron stars , we have performed the first step towards the much more involved task of deriving the evolution equations for rotating neutron stars . here",
    ", the linearization of the original einstein equations yields quite obscure perturbation equations , which first have to be cast into a suitable hyperbolic form before trying to discretize them on a numerical grid . with the adm - equations this is a much more straightforward procedure .",
    "we have presented results for different stellar models with polytropic equations of state . for the least relativistic model",
    ", the wave signal did not show any @xmath3-modes , although mode calculations show that they do exist .",
    "but they are so strongly damped that the tail - like fall - off wins over the @xmath3-modes . only for more compact stellar models , the @xmath3-modes are less strongly damped , and they can show up in the waveforms . however , even for very relativistic neutron star models , @xmath3-modes are not necessarily part of the waveform .",
    "in fact , their occurrence strongly depends on the choice of initial data . for initial data representing a gravitational wave pulse that will hit the star , @xmath3-modes in general",
    "will be part of the spectrum , however , for initial fluid perturbations , the choice of conformally flat initial data ( @xmath212 ) can totally suppress the presence of @xmath3-modes , whereas setting @xmath210 and @xmath291 , which can be regarded in some sense as a maximal deviation from conformal flatness , shows strong @xmath3-mode excitation .",
    "for very compact stars , we found that the complex frequency of the very first ring - down phase does not correspond to any of the proper quasi - normal modes of the stellar model .",
    "instead , the frequency is almost identical with the first quasi - normal frequency of a black hole with the same mass .",
    "we explained this phenomenon by observing that those parts of the potential , which are responsible for the first scattering of the impinging wave packet , lie outside the star and therefore are the same for a black hole . only if the part of the wave packet that could penetrate the neutron star is reflected , the proper ring - down with the trapped and fluid modes starts .",
    "this phenomenon , although already present in previous evolution results @xcite , apparently has not been recognized before .",
    "when switching to realistic equations of state , we are faced with a numerical instability that is due to the sharp drop of the sound speed at the neutron drip point , which is located quite close to the stellar surface .",
    "since the neutron drip point is located in the low pressure regime , it is a feature of any realistic equation of state , and therefore the instability should occur for all of them .",
    "the quite peculiar fact about this instability is that it disappears when the resolution is increased above a certain threshold .",
    "this threshold depends on the depth of the dip of the sound speed and is the higher the deeper the dip is .",
    "it seems that this instability is present for any explicit numerical discretization scheme , however , the minimum resolution that is needed in order to suppress it , can vary drastically for different schemes .",
    "indeed , when using the two step lax - wendroff scheme for the equations written as a first order system , we were confronted with an almost unsurmountable resolution threshold needed for stable evolution .",
    "this instability does not depend on the actual formulation of the equations and is present for any of the given formulations of this paper .",
    "in fact , it is not only a peculiar problem of the non - radial perturbation equations , the same instability also occurs in the radial case @xcite ; the reason being that the structure of the fluid equations is the same in both cases .",
    "as a remedy , we introduced the coordinate transformation , which leads to a wave equation for the fluid with unity propagation speed throughout the whole star .",
    "it is now possible to evolve oscillations of realistic stellar models for any resolution . as a further benefit ,",
    "the evolution of the fluid on the @xmath270-grid is , for a given number of grid points inside the star , much more accurate than the corresponding evolution on the @xmath0-grid with the same number of grid points .",
    "this is because the @xmath270-coordinate resolves the region close to the stellar surface much better than the ordinary @xmath0-coordinate .",
    "this coordinate transformation could also prove useful for fast rotating neutron stars , since the evolution equations of the fluid will certainly have the same structure that leads to the numerical instability in the non - rotating case .",
    "since the rotating case is a 2d problem , resorting to higher resolutions may become impossible , and therefore our coordinate transformation could do the job .",
    "maybe , this transformation could even be of avail in nonlinear evolutions , although it is not that straightforward to implement , since there is no fixed background model with a static profile of the sound speed . a possibility is to view eq .   as a dynamic coordinate condition that depends on the actual profile of the sound speed at every instance of time .",
