    "in its simplest form , the idea of extended unitarity ( eu ) states that the @xmath6 pair in a single partial wave should have the same phase variation with @xmath5 in _ all _ reactions as in elastic scattering .",
    "this idea originates from aitchison @xcite and has been adopted in various guises by many authors .",
    "his arguments will be presented in detail in section 2 , so as to expose the assumptions and consequences . at the time the idea was introduced , it was a reasonable conjecture ; now modern data allow it to be checked accurately , but disagree with it .",
    "many experimental groups have made extensive fits to production data using a @xmath7-matrix approach based on eu .",
    "these fits are excellent ; no criticism is intended of their quality .",
    "experimentalists have found empirically the necessary freedom to get good fits to data .",
    "however , on close inspection , this freedom is inconsistent with strict eu .",
    "this whole topic has been the subject of extensive discussion with many authors .",
    "there is a bewildering jungle of claims and counter - claims .",
    "my objective is to cut a path through this tangle and expose where problems lie ; this makes the presentation pedantic in places .",
    "aitchison s essential point is that all processes should be described by a universal denominator @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath7 is the same as for elastic scattering ; @xmath9 is lorentz invariant phase space .",
    "the assumption which is being made is that watson s theorem @xcite applies to the coherent sum of all components in the @xmath10 partial wave .",
    "this is a step beyond watson s derivation , which referred only to a single eigenstate ; watson did not consider overlapping resonances .",
    "-12 mm -7 mm    in @xmath6 elastic scattering , the @xmath3 is superimposed on a slowly rising amplitude associated with the @xmath2 pole .",
    "cern - munich data @xcite show that the phases of these two components add . below the @xmath11 threshold ,",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath12-matrices @xmath13 are confined to the unitarity circle if we neglect the tiny inelasticity due to @xmath14 .",
    "unitarity may be satisfied by multiplying @xmath15-matrices @xmath16 of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as suggested by dalitz and tuan @xcite .",
    "this fits the data within errors of @xmath17 .",
    "1 shows the argand diagram for the @xmath18 @xmath6 s - wave from my recent re - analysis of these ( and other ) data @xcite . from bes data on @xmath19",
    ", the @xmath3 has a full - width at half - maximum of @xmath20 mev @xcite .",
    "the combined phase shift rises rapidly from @xmath21 at 0.88 gev to @xmath22 near 1.1 gev .",
    "there is a deep dip in the cross section where the combined phase goes rapidly through @xmath23 .",
    "the crucial point of eu is that this feature should be common to production processes .",
    "-15 mm -8 mm    bes data on @xmath24 @xcite immediately require a modification of the rudimentary form of eu . the @xmath6 mass spectrum in these data is reproduced in fig .",
    "there is a dominant @xmath3 contribution and a small interfering @xmath2 contribution ; this is very different to elastic scattering .",
    "l \" ahde and meissner @xcite modify the conjecture of eu to apply separately to strange and non - strange components , i.e. to the scalar form factors for @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "the dip in the elastic cross section at 989 mev is a very delicate feature .",
    "if , for any reason , relative magnitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath25 change , the zero at 989 mev can disappear quickly ; here and elsewhere , @xmath25 will denote @xmath3 unless there is confusion with other @xmath25 s . if the phase of @xmath25 changes with respect to the @xmath2 , the mass at which the dip appears will likewise change .",
    "the interference region between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is an ideal place to check extended unitarity .",
    "two considerations will play a critical role : unitarity and analyticity .",
    "unitarity is often quoted and plays an essential role in setting up the current @xmath7-matrix formalism which treats both elastic scattering and production on the same basis . for a production reaction , aitchison conjectures a unitarity relation for the production amplitude @xmath26 : @xmath27 he defines his @xmath26 to be proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 refers to production : @xmath30 dividing both sides of ( 1 ) by @xmath31 , @xmath32 it is odd that @xmath29 on the right - hand side is multiplied by @xmath33 , unless @xmath34 .",
    "however , experiment will require different contributions to @xmath29 from @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "consider next analyticity .",
    "dispersion relations connect magnitudes and phases .",
    "if the relative magnitudes of @xmath25 and @xmath2 change from those of elastic scattering because of matrix elements , their relative phases _ must _ also change .",
    "conversely , analyticity predicts that if the phase variation with @xmath5 of the amplitude is universal , as eu demands , so is the variation with @xmath5 of the magnitude ( up to a constant scaling factor ) ; for the simplest situation where only resonances are present , the relative magnitudes of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and any further @xmath25 must be _ almost _ the same in production as elastic scattering .",
    "this is a point which has almost always been ignored .",
    "the word ` almost ' represents a caveat : there may in addition be a polynomial is @xmath5 which can be different between elastic scattering and production .",
    "it turns out that one can plausibly limit deviations of relative magnitudes within @xmath35 .",
    "this question is discussed in subsection 2.1 .",
    "experiment requires larger deviations than this in the four sets of data discussed here .",
    "this implies phases must change from those predicted by eu .",
    "experimentalists have correctly allowed for this by using complex coupling constants in the isobar model .",
    "section 3 compares the prediction of eu with 3 sets of data .",
    "the first concerns bes data for @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the non - strange components of @xmath2 and @xmath25 dominate both elastic scattering and @xmath0 . from aitchison",
    "s algebra and that of lhde and meissner , it follows that the @xmath25 amplitude should have almost the same magnitude as the @xmath2 amplitude , as well as the same phase as elastic scattering .",
    "this prediction is contradicted by the data , where no @xmath3 is visible and a fit to the data places a low limit on it",
    ".    the next two sets are crystal barrel data for @xmath37 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are clearly visible @xcite .",
    "one set is for annihilation in liquid hydrogen and the other for gaseous hydrogen .",
    "annihilation from the @xmath38 initial state is 13% in liquid and 48% in gas , allowing a clear separation of amplitudes for production of @xmath2 and @xmath25 from @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "results for both are inconsistent with the deep dip of elastic scattering predicted by eu .",
    "section 4 concerns data from the afs experiment on central production : @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "here one expects the protons in the final state to act as spectators .",
    "however , eu still fails conspicuously to fit the data .",
    "this important result leads to a revised form of the unitarity relation , as follows .",
    "-87 mm -52 mm    fig .",
    "3 sketches the usual diagrammatic approach to the unitarity relation .",
    "it may be derived by cutting the diagram down the middle , along the dashed line . for a 2-body system of @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath41 , etc .",
    "the resulting relation is well known : @xmath42 the application of 2-body unitarity assumes that the pions interact only with one another , not with any spectator .",
    "in most sets of data there are large signals where pions do interact with the spectator . for @xmath0 , as an example , the @xmath43 channel accounts for 40% of events @xcite .",
    "some of it may be generated by pions from decays of @xmath2 or @xmath25 rescattering from the spectator ; this is a so - called triangle graph .",
    "aitchison himself remarks that this can distort the unitarity relation .",
    "this provides one reason why eu may fail for the first three sets of data ; it does not explain the fourth , where some further effect is required .",
    "there are fundamental differences between elastic scattering and production . in @xmath0 , for example , matrix elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 dictate the magnitudes of these amplitudes ; any values are possible .",
    "this differs from elastic scattering , where @xmath2 and @xmath25 magnitudes are fixed purely by their coupling constants @xmath46 to @xmath6 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) is an asymmetric relation , allowing @xmath2 and @xmath25 to be produced with different magnitudes , but requiring that they rescatter an in elastic scattering .",
    "a more logical alternative is the symmetric relation @xmath47 hence @xmath48 .",
    "this relation fits afs data for central production naturally , whereas eu does not .",
    "if the @xmath25 is absent from production data , ( 5 ) reduces to the obvious relation latexmath:[${\\rm im}\\ , t^\\sigma =    does not allow the @xmath25 to be absent , as we shall see in section 2 .",
    "section 5 suggests a new way of fitting 2-body data .",
    "section 6 then summarises conclusions .",
    "in a two - body process , the scattering of a pair of pions to final states @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath41 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 must satisfy unitarity .",
    "the @xmath12-matrix for these coupled channels may be written in terms of a real @xmath7-matrix as @xmath52 it is normalised here so that @xmath53 . below the inelastic threshold @xmath54",
    "the @xmath12-matrices used here will include couplings to all channels .",
    "however , it simplifies the presentation of essential points to reduce the formalism initially to a single @xmath6 channel .",
    "this simplication is sufficient to expose the basic issues , and can be generalised later to include inelasticity .",
    "the approach of aitchison @xcite will now be outlined .",
    "i am grateful to him for clarifying the algebra in more detail than is to be found in the original publication .",
    "suppose @xmath15-matrices multiply , i.e. phases add .",
    "let @xmath55 and @xmath56 be @xmath7-matrices for @xmath2 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the elementary expression for @xmath57 then gives a @xmath7-matrix for elastic scattering @xmath58 from which it follows that the @xmath12-matrix for elastic scattering is @xmath59    aitchison now conjectures that an amplitude @xmath26 for producing a two - body channel present in @xmath60 may be written in terms of a vector @xmath61 , with @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants for production couplings . with this ansatz ,",
    "the relation @xmath65 known as extended unitarity , is automatically satisfied .",
    "it is a consequence of ( 10 ) that @xmath26 has the same phase as @xmath66 . substituting ( 8) and ( 11 ) in ( 10 ) gives , in this one - channel case @xmath67/\\rho , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath68 . from ( 13 ) , the phase of @xmath26 is indeed @xmath69 , as imposed by ( 10 ) .",
    "equation ( 14 ) will play the decisive role in comparisons with experiment .    in ( 14 ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . at 989 mev , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "so both terms are very close to zero , regardless of the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this predicts that production data should have the same deep dip at this energy as elastic scattering .",
    "there is a further point . in the second term ,",
    "@xmath74 over a sizable mass range . in the first term",
    ", @xmath75 should be conspicuous , since it has a rapid phase variation and the same peak magnitude as @xmath76 , which is itself clearly visible in all sets of data considered here .",
    "however , the data all require the magnitude of the @xmath3 to be smaller than predicted .",
    "the key point is that the factor @xmath77 of ( 13 ) leads directly to the factor @xmath78 in the first term of ( 14 ) .",
    "the first and third sets of data will require @xmath79 of ( 14 ) to be small . in the elastic region ,",
    "the first term becomes @xmath80 the bizarre conclusion of eu is that the phase of the @xmath3 is present even though @xmath81 .",
    "this is inconsistent with analyticity .",
    "it will be shown in section 3 that experiment disagrees with eu even without the constraint of analyticity .",
    "however this additional constraint makes conclusions more definitive .      for purely elastic scattering ,",
    "the omn ` es relation @xcite reads [ including a factor @xmath82 in @xmath83 : @xmath84,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where p denotes the principal value integral .",
    "we shall not actually need to evaluate ( 16 ) .",
    "it plays only a conceptual role and this needs considerable explanation .",
    "the basic point is that @xmath85 contains both real and imaginary parts , so @xmath86 determines both . for elastic scattering @xmath87",
    "it arises from the left - hand cut , i.e. meson exchanges between the two pions .    with inelasticity",
    ", corresponding relations may be written in a 2-channel form .",
    "then @xmath88 is replaced by @xmath89 , the angle @xmath12 makes to the real axis when measured from the origin of the argand diagram , see fig .",
    "12 of subsection 4.1 .",
    "if eu is valid , the production amplitude may be written @xmath90 . in principle",
    "@xmath91 could be anything , depending on production dynamics .",
    "however , we have quite precise experimental information about it .",
    "an extreme view is that @xmath63 and @xmath64 of ( 13 ) can be arbitrary and complex .",
    "however if they are complex this leads directly to a conflict with eu .",
    "equation ( 14 ) contains two parts @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "substituting breit - wigner formulae for @xmath76 and @xmath75 , the first term becomes @xmath94 .",
    "this is real but has a specific @xmath5-dependence in the numerator as well as in the denominator .",
    "if @xmath63 or @xmath64 becomes complex , the numerator becomes complex .",
    "this then introduces a phase variation separate from @xmath85 .",
    "the `` prediction '' of eu is distorted by this extra phase .",
    "only if @xmath91 is real does eu survive in its strict form .",
    "many experimental groups have used the p - vector approach using complex coupling coefficients , without realising that this destroys the universality of the phase variation with @xmath5 .",
    "this is what experiment demands , so they have done the right thing .",
    "but the use of the universal denominator @xmath95 $ ] is no longer logically correct .",
    "one might as well fit directly in terms of complex coupling constants and individual @xmath12-matrices for each resonance .",
    "there is a further fundamental point . for elastic scattering",
    ", @xmath96 is uniquely related to @xmath97 by both unitarity and analyticity . at first sight",
    "it appears that analyticity relates @xmath91 in the same way to @xmath85 in production reactions , with the result @xmath98 , where @xmath31 is a constant .",
    "this requires @xmath99 : if the phase of the @xmath6 amplitude is universal , relative magnitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath25 must also be universal .",
    "there is however a caveat .",
    "a more fundamental form of the unitarity relation ( 12 ) is that the discontinuity of @xmath26 across the elastic branch cut is @xmath100 .",
    "then @xmath26 may be multiplied by a polynomial @xmath91 , providing it does not have a discontinuity along the real @xmath5-axis .",
    "a few examples will hopefully clarify ideas .",
    "firstly , a form factor in @xmath5 is one such example , arising from the sizes of particles , i.e. from matrix elements .",
    "secondly , in @xmath101 , the e1 transition has an intensity proportional to the cube of the photon momentum ; this inflates the lower side of the @xmath3 .",
    "thirdly , in @xmath38 @xmath102 , there is an @xmath103 centrifugal barrier for the production process .",
    "fourthly , in some special cases , matrix elements may go through zero as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "taking @xmath91 to be real , let us write in general @xmath104    a feature of all production data considered here is a strong low - mass @xmath6 peak due to the @xmath2 pole .",
    "this peak is not present in elastic scattering because of an adler zero in the elastic scattering amplitude at @xmath105 , just below the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "the elastic amplitude rises approximately linearly with @xmath5 and there is no low mass peak . the origin of the difference has been known to theorists for at least 20 years .",
    "au , morgan and pennington @xcite pointed out that the difference between elastic scattering and central production data can be accomodated by using the same breit - wigner denominator for both , but replacing the numerator @xmath96 by something close to a constant .",
    "this polynomial is allowed because @xmath106 is outside the physical region .",
    "data require @xmath107 , hence @xmath108 .",
    "more exactly , @xmath109\\ ] ] for the parametrisation of the @xmath2 amplitude in @xcite . in practice , quadatic and",
    "cubic terms in @xmath5 are very small and under tight control from fits to data up to 1.8 gev .    for @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath2 pole is visible by eye in fig .",
    "4(a ) below .",
    "the phase of the @xmath2 amplitude in this reaction is experimentally the same as in elastic scattering within @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath110 can be determined directly from the data .",
    "the same is true of the @xmath111 @xcite , which likewise has an adler zero in the numerator for elastic scattering , but not for production . in both cases",
    ", @xmath112 is consistent within errors with a constant ; the adler zero in the numerator of elastic scattering has disappeared .",
    "one can try fitting the @xmath2 and @xmath111 poles in production data with the conventional form factor @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is momentum in the production channel . for both",
    ", @xmath115 optimises at slightly negative values , which are unphysical . for the @xmath2 , @xmath116 @xmath117 with @xmath118 confidence and for the @xmath111 , @xmath119 @xmath117 at the same level",
    ".    a crucial piece of information in testing eu will be relative magnitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath2 amplitude is easily separated from the tail of the @xmath3 at 920 mev , three half - widths from 989 mev . if @xmath91 is determined at this energy and at 400 mev , the @xmath2 amplitude changes by @xmath120 at 989 mev for the @xmath118 confidence level quoted above .",
    "however , this exaggerates the error , since there are compensating changes in the line - shape fitted to the amplitude .",
    "realistically , changes are half this . adding in quadrature uncertainties in the @xmath2 line - shape due to the opening of the @xmath11 threshold , the uncertainty in the amplitude extrapolated from 920 to 989 mev is @xmath121 with @xmath118 confidence .",
    "this provides a tight constraint on the relative magnitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 amplitudes if eu is correct .",
    "this disposes of the paradox that the phase of @xmath3 can be present with @xmath122 .    from this point",
    "onwards , it will be assumed that eu should be supplemented with the condition imposed by analyticity within @xmath35 .",
    "formulae and numerical parameters for the @xmath2 amplitude are to be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . the @xmath4 coupling has been fitted to four sources : ( i ) phase shifts deduced from cern - munich data by ochs @xcite , ( ii ) @xmath123 data of pislak et al .",

    "@xcite using the roy equations , and ( iv ) bes data on @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the coupling to @xmath11 and @xmath41 has been fitted to available data on those channels @xcite , and in @xcite the @xmath50 coupling has been derived from cern - munich data . there is close consistency between all these sets of data .",
    "because refs . @xcite and @xcite fit the same data with different formulae , the amplitudes agree within errors up to 1.2 gev . those of ref",
    "@xcite are more cumbersome to use , since they allow for the dispersive effect of the @xmath50 threshold",
    ". therefore the first and fourth sets of data discussed below are fitted with the formulae from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the general procedure adopted here is to allow the parameters of the @xmath2 to have the freedom allowed in earlier determinations of its parameters , but no extra freedom in the vicinity of @xmath3 . in testing eu , the magnitude of @xmath25",

    "unfortunately , the pdg does not report the bes determination of @xmath140 , which is the best in the published literature because of the availability of a clear signal in @xmath141 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the bes parameters for @xmath3 are closely consistent with kloe data @xcite on @xmath142 when one allows for interference between @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",

    "4(c ) ; however , the price is a considerable deterioration of log likelihood compared with the fit of fig .",
    "the isobar model fit is better than eu by 259 in log likelihood .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "firstly , the narrow @xmath25 does not appear in interferences with either @xmath161 or @xmath152 .",
    "the mass resolution of the bes data is 4 mev in @xmath6 at 950 mev ; searching for the @xmath3 with accurately known line - shape is limited purely by statistics and there are @xmath169k events .",
    "secondly , in the fit based on eu , there are strong conflicts between interference terms amongst @xmath43 , @xmath165 and @xmath164 .",
    "the data want slowly varying interferences between @xmath161 and the broad @xmath152 , instead of rapidly varying interferences of the narrow @xmath25 with @xmath161 and/or @xmath152",
    ".    there are two extra fitting parameters for the isobar model fit : i.e. two complex coupling constant for @xmath164 instead of one .",
    "[ the @xmath170 @xmath157 amplitude is negligible ] .",
    "the definition of log likelihood is such that a change of 0.5 corresponds to a one standard deviation change in one variable . for large statistics ,",
    "@xmath171 is approximately twice the change in log likelihood .",
    "so the fit of fig .",
    "4(a ) is better than eu by 19.7 standard deviations statistically .",
    "it is important to remark that the bes publication gives a second fit done independently .",
    "this shows a @xmath6 mass projection almost identical with the scalar form factor .",
    "this requires a very strong @xmath3 , in conflict with what one can see by eye in fig .",
    "however , this analysis made no use of the @xmath158 decay plane . without that information ,",
    "it is impossible to disentangle the magnitudes of the five @xmath151 amplitudes ; the determination of the magnitude and phase of the @xmath3 signal becomes very poor .",
    "i have rechecked the analysis omitting information from the @xmath158 decay plane .",
    "no stable fit emerges with the @xmath6 mass projection of the second fit in the bes publication , and there is no evidence for the presence of @xmath3 at all in this fit .",
    "the only explanation i can find of this second bes fit is that the relative magnitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath2 have been constrained to agree with the scalar form factor .",
    "this is , of course , exactly what needs to be checked in the present work .",

    "5 shows the argand diagram for @xmath172 from my fit to @xmath2 and @xmath25 ; the factor @xmath9 is included so that the diagram goes to zero at the @xmath6 threshold .",

    "there is a small structure due to @xmath3 . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the dashed curve shows the @xmath2 amplitude alone and the dotted curve shows the eu prediction normalised to the full curve at 0.47 gev , the peak of the @xmath2 .",
    "the essential point is that the deep dip in this latter curve near the @xmath25 mass is missing from the data .",
    "there is one qualitative feature of fig . 5 which will be important later .",
    "the amplitudes in a production process are free to add vectorially in any way required by the data .",
    "this situation is quite different from elastic scattering , where the amplitude is constrained to the unitary circle .",
    "it is now necessary to consider a number of systematic questions which might blur the argument against eu .",
    "corresponding remarks will apply to fits to the other three sets of data .",
    "firstly , could the disappearance of the predicted @xmath3 arise from effects of the @xmath11 threshold ?",
    "the answer is no , because the @xmath25 appears clearly in elastic scattering and the prediction of eu is that it should be almost identical in production . a precise cancellation of the magnitude and phase of the predicted @xmath25",
    "would be needed .",
    "this is ruled out by the known couplings of both @xmath2 and @xmath25 to @xmath11 .",
    "the analytic continuation for the @xmath3 below the @xmath11 threshold is accurately determined over the small mass range concerned by bes data on @xmath175 and @xmath141 . in the @xmath2 amplitude ,",
    "the @xmath11 inelasticity rises over a mass scale of 200 mev as shown in fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "any flexibility in the analytic continuation of the @xmath11 term then has a scale of @xmath176 mev .",
    "furthermore , it is closely constrained by the fit to kloe data on @xmath177 .",
    "so this explanation is highly implausible .",
    "secondly , could the bes data be fitted assuming @xmath178 , followed by @xmath179 ? this has been tested by adding @xmath180 fitted freely .",
    "its magnitude optimises at zero within errors .",
    "it improves log likelihood only by 2 .",
    "thirdly , aitchison argues @xcite that a further term @xmath181 might be added to the @xmath61-vector due to dynamics of the production process .",
    "a similar approach was used in fits by bowler et al . and basdevant and berger to the @xmath182 to allow for the deck effect @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "an additional term @xmath183 appears in @xmath184 .",
    "if @xmath185 , the second term can cancel the term @xmath186 of eu , leaving @xmath76 and the first of the additional terms , which is close to 0 since @xmath187 .",
    "this removes almost all the structure due to @xmath3 .",
    "however , this cancellation also leaves a term @xmath188 and when @xmath189 is small this becomes @xmath190 , which is much larger than the term @xmath76 itself if @xmath181 is a constant .",
    "this is ruled out by the data , so it becomes necessary to tailor the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath181 to reproduce the magnitude of the @xmath6 amplitude .    however , this is not the end of the story .",
    "phase information is also available . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that interference between @xmath2 and @xmath154 measures the phase of the @xmath2 amplitude ( plus any background term @xmath181 ) and requires it to be the same as for elastic scattering down to 450 mev with an error of @xmath191 in the worst scenario , see fig . 2 of that paper .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is a similar result for the @xmath111 in @xcite .",
    "4(a ) of that paper shows that the @xmath111 phase from bes data on @xmath192 agrees with the lass effective range formula for elastic scattering down to 750 mev within @xmath193 .",
    "4(f ) of the same paper shows a corresponding agreement for e791 data on @xmath194 within a similar error .",
    "these results rule out any background different from @xmath2 and @xmath111 with a magnitude larger than @xmath35 and a phase difference above @xmath195 .",
    "they of course agree with watson s original statement that @xmath85 of a single resonance should be universal .",
    "there is no obvious source of the background proposed by aitchison , as there was in @xmath196 , where a deck background was visible in the data and made a @xmath197 contribution to cancelling the @xmath182 amplitude . a similar fortuitous cancellation with unidentified backgrounds",
    "will be required also for all three of the following sets of data . in all cases ,",
    "the additional background gives rise to a phase variation different to strict eu .",
    "if the background removes the @xmath25 , only the @xmath2 is left , i.e. @xmath198 , which contributes only part of the phase of elastic scattering ; so the amplitude does not satisfy eu .",

    "12 shows the argand diagram for the fitted amplitude .",
    "this illustrates the form of eq .",
    "there is a geometrical relation between the imaginary part of the amplitude and its modulus squared , but it is a different relation to eu . the @xmath3 amplitude is smaller than that of the @xmath2 and their relative phases are different to eu .",
    "the same is true of fig .",
    "5 , the argand diagram fitting bes data ; there the @xmath3 contribution is very small .",
    "let us now return to equations ( 20 ) and ( 24 ) and review their general features .",
    "the last term of ( 24 ) , @xmath275 as @xmath242 and @xmath276 .",
    "furthermore it approaches this limit non - linearly as @xmath242 .",
    "the interesting point is that two - body elastic scattering emerges as a limiting case of a more general relation .",
    "furthermore it has pathological properties as the relative magnitude of a and b crosses 1 ( or -1 ) . if b becomes larger than a , it is necessary to interchange the roles of a and b. as @xmath79 approaches 1 from below , @xmath277 and one recovers the standard result of elastic scattering .",
    "further pathological cases arise if @xmath278 ( impossible in the 2-body elastic case ) .",
    "elastic scattering is in fact a very special case .",
    "so eu can fail very badly as @xmath79 departs from 1 .    as @xmath79 drops from 1 , the phase @xmath263 measured from the origin of the argand diagram soon changes by only a modest amount over the @xmath25 . in this case",
    ", the isobar model becomes an excellent approximation : the @xmath25 has its usual dependence on @xmath5 through its phase shift @xmath220 and the @xmath25 amplitude adds vectorially to the @xmath2 ; the isobar model can then fit a constant phase to both quite successfully if the term @xmath279 is small .    in summary",
    ", the modified form of eu suggested in ( 20 ) and ( 24 ) gives a much better fit than eu .",
    "the fit of morgan and pennington @xcite using eu requires an additional third - sheet pole at @xmath280 mev .",
    "this additional pole can not be accomodated by bes @xmath175 data , which require only a second - sheet pole at @xmath281 mev and a broad third - sheet pole at @xmath282 mev .",
    "these two poles have a natural explanation .",
    "if the coupling of @xmath3 to @xmath11 is allowed to decrease gradually to zero , leaving other parameters unchanged , the two poles coalesce towards the same pole position @xmath283 mev ; it is the effect of @xmath284 which moves the second - sheet pole to the @xmath11 threshold and moves the third - sheet pole away .",
    "there is no pole in this mass range from the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "a second remark is that all of @xmath2 , @xmath111 , @xmath139 and @xmath3 may be reproduced as a nonet by the model of rupp and van beveren , where mesons couple to a quark loop @xcite . in this model ,",
    "no additional pole like that of morgan and pennington appears in the mass range close to the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "these two results suggest that the additional pole is a consequence of the constraint of eu .",
    "the relation ( 20 ) is a new conjecture .",
    "are there forseeable snags ?",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath25 may mix , and this mixing could be different in elastic scattering and production .",
    "this mixing would alter the apparent width of @xmath3 and could induce an additional phase change relative to @xmath2 .",
    "presently there is no indication of any need for mixing .",
    "such mixing will be absent if @xmath2 and @xmath3 have strictly orthogonal wave functions , as is plausible for members of the same nonet . on fig .",
    "2 , the @xmath2 is definitely visible in @xmath175 data",
    ". it would not be surprising if @xmath175 and @xmath160 channels filter out orthogonal combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath25 . from fig .",
    "2 , one can estimate the relative intensities of @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is necessary to allow for the mass resolution , since the @xmath25 amplitude falls extremely rapidly from its peak at 989 mev , particularly above the @xmath11 threshold . doing this ,",
    "the intensity of @xmath2 is @xmath285 of @xmath25 at the peak , i.e. @xmath120 in amplitde .",
    "this is marginally higher than the @xmath25 signal fitted to @xmath160 but within the error , supporting the idea of orthogonal amplitudes .",
    "many authors use the @xmath7-matrix to satisfy unitarity for 2-body scattering , e.g. the coupled channels @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath41 , @xmath286 and @xmath50 .",
    "the popular approach is to add @xmath7-matrices of all resonances appearing in one partial wave .",
    "however , if resonances overlap , as @xmath2 and @xmath3 do , the @xmath7-matrix poles occur at masses where combined phase shifts happen to go through @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc . ,",
    "i.e. at @xmath287 and 1200 mev .",
    "firstly , an expansion in terms of these poles is problematical for @xmath3 unless other factors or high powers of @xmath5 are included .",
    "secondly , the relation between @xmath7-matrix poles and @xmath12-matrix poles is obscure .",
    "any one @xmath12-matrix pole is built up from all @xmath7-matrix poles ; the converse is obvious .",
    "the prescription that @xmath15-matrices multiply below the inelastic threshold does not appear naturally , but has to be enforced by fitting data .",
    "an attractive alternative can be constructed following the spirit of aitchison s approach ( for 2-body scattering ) .",
    "suppose one combines two resonances according to the prescription @xmath288 below the @xmath11 threshold , this automatically gives the result that phase shifts add .",
    "[ further resonances may be combined by iterating this prescription ] . a nice feature of ( 30 )",
    "is that one can write @xmath289 using the same mass @xmath290 as the usual breit - wigner denominator .",
    "a second attractive feature of ( 31 ) is that the amplitude continues naturally through the @xmath11 threshold , because of the factor @xmath291 in the denominator .    my own approach in several papers ,",
    "@xcite has been close to this .",
    "all diagonal elements of @xmath15-matrices are multiplied , as proposed here .",
    "magnitudes of off - diagonal elements of the @xmath15-matrix need to be calculated from unitarity relations .",
    "for example , for a 3-channel system : @xmath292 the phase of these off - diagonal elements has been fitted empirically , whereas ( 30 ) would predict these phases .",
    "this approach successfully fits elastic data , @xmath293 and @xmath41 with one proviso : a good fit requires inclusion of mixing between @xmath2 , @xmath226 and @xmath294 @xcite , using the formulae of anisovich , anisovich and sarantsev @xcite ; these formulae are the modern equivalent of the breit - rabi equation of molecular spectroscopy , generalised to include resonance widths .",
    "crystal barrel data have @xmath3 and @xmath2 components with relative magnitudes seriously different to those predicted by eu plus analyticity .",
    "furthermore , they are different in @xmath295 and @xmath38 annihilation . the bes data for @xmath124 do not reproduce the deep dip of elastic scattering at 989 mev .",
    "afs data likewise do not contain the same dip at this mass .",
    "all these results are in conflict with equation ( 14 ) , which is a direct consequence of eu .",
    "this shows unambiguously that there must be a major flaw in the hypothesis of eu .",
    "experimentalists have dealt with this problem by using complex coupling constants for each resonance . however , as emphasised in subsection 2.1 , the imaginary part of the coupling constant introduces into the numerator of the amplitude an @xmath5-dependent phase variation which alters the universal phase coming from the denominator @xmath296 $ ] .",
    "this destroys the original idea of a universal phase .",
    "one might as well fit directly in terms of the @xmath12-matrix of each individual resonance , along the lines outlined in section 5 .",
    "the form of the @xmath7-matrix suggested there would eliminate differences between @xmath7-matrix and @xmath12-matrix poles , making interpretation of results more direct .",
    "not all experimentalists adopt the p - vector approach .",
    "some fit directly in terms of individual @xmath12-matrices for each resonance , including sequential decays from one resonance to a daughter with different complex coupling constants for each decay mode .",
    "ascoli and wyld @xcite and schult and wyld @xcite consider a multiple scattering series of the type @xmath297 , etc , where @xmath298 is a 3-body resonance and brackets indicate resonances in two - body sub - systems ; this is a unitarity effect of a different form to that considered here .    in view of the failure of eu in the 4 cases considered here ,",
    "each new set of data should be inspected on its merits .",
    "let us examine ways of trying to save eu .",
    "firstly , it is possible that unspecified backgrounds can be added to the p - vector so as to side - step the conflict .",
    "however , analyticity independently limits relative magnitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath2 within @xmath35 .",
    "experimental determinations of @xmath2 and @xmath111 phases in @xcite and @xcite constrain phases within @xmath195 .",
    "the probability that unspecified backgrounds can evade eq .",
    "( 14 ) to this accuracy in four sets of data is vanishingly small .",
    "furthermore , if such backgrounds are introduced , eu loses any predictive power .",
    "secondly , crystal barrel data and afs data can not be fitted with eu whether or not the @xmath209 s - wave amplitude is included .",
    "so this is not a satisfactory escape route .",
    "a third likely possibility , applicable to the first three sets of data , is that pions from sigma and/or @xmath3 rescatter from the spectator particle , leading to a breakdown of eu .",
    "aitchison himself pointed this out .",
    "today , we known that such graphs have magnitudes typically @xmath299 of those of the parent processes before the rescattering .",
    "this is sufficient to introduce large phase changes in some cases , but not all .    for all of these three sets of data",
    ", the isobar model provides an excellent fit .",
    "the production amplitude is then written @xmath300 with complex @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in this form , no vestige remains of the constraint that @xmath15-matrices must multiply as in elastic scattering .",
    "relative magnitudes of @xmath63 and @xmath64 can arise from matrix elements coupling the initial state to each resonance . for @xmath0 and @xmath301 ,",
    "the @xmath25 component is so small that one can not tell whether the phase alone follows eu or not .",
    "however , for @xmath302 , the @xmath25 signal is large enough to rule out this possibility .",
    "the fourth point is that one would still expect eu to work for afs data , but it does not .",
    "an excellent fit may be obtained by replacing the unitarity relation @xmath303 by the new relation @xmath304 this corresponds to the relation @xmath305 rather than the commonly used form @xmath306 .",
    "equations ( 20 ) and ( 24 ) have pathological behaviour in the vicinity of the 2-body elastic limit @xmath99 .",
    "one can now see the basic problem of eu .",
    "it attempts to impose on the 3-body system a very special behaviour which is narrowly restricted to 2-body scattering . away from the special case @xmath99 ,",
    "the isobar model works successfully .",
    "there are two points about the new unitarity relations .",
    "firstly , it was argued in section 2.1 that a universal phase in the denominator of the amplitude also requires , via analyticity , almost universal magnitudes ; the word ` almost ' covers the possibility that there may be slowly varying form factors or centrifugal barrier factors in production reactions without corresponding changes to @xmath85 .",
    "if relative magnitudes of resonances differ by large amounts between 2-body scattering and production , their relative phases _ must _ also change .",
    "secondly , the new unitarity relation ( 33 ) succeeds quantitatively in accounting for the observed relative phase between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in central production . that is a non - trivial result .",
    "the fit to afs data then requires only two poles in the vicinity of @xmath3 , in agreement with the bes line - shape ( as does the isobar model ) .",
    "eu requires an extra pole for which there is no obvious explanation .",
    "the form of this new unitarity relation is illustrated by the argand diagrams of figs .",
    "5 and 12 . in both ,",
    "the @xmath3 amplitude is small or fairly small and so is @xmath254 of eq .",
    "( 19 ) . as a result ,",
    "the phase @xmath263 measured from the origin of the argand diagram changes rather little over the @xmath25 .",
    "this is an extra source of phases appearing in the isobar model , and has not been appreciated before .",
    "however , one then needs to ask whether this new relation can be used universally in the isobar model .",
    "does it , for example , correctly describe the relative phases of @xmath2 and @xmath25 in @xmath307 data and in @xmath24 ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "for these two reactions , the agreement between data and equations ( 20 ) and ( 24 ) improves substantially over eu .",
    "however , there are still discrepancies with the new unitarity relation of @xmath308 , which is still significant .",
    "it seems likely that rescattering of pions from the spectator introduces some additional phases .",
    "the new unitarity relation needs to be tested elsewhere .",
    "a possible testing ground is in kloe data on @xmath309 , where both @xmath2 and @xmath25 may contribute , but the decay is electromagnetic ; the small amplitude from @xmath310 introduces a perturbation of only @xmath285 in amplitude and only in well defined parts of the dalitz plot .",
    "the remedy which succeeds well in fitting nearly all data is the isobar model , where both magnitudes and phases of resonances are both fitted freely .",
    "it needs to be emphasised that experimental groups have adopted the flexibility needed to fit existing data , so their results are essentially sound and are not in question .",
    "the hypothesis of eu has mostly been adopted by theorists for making predictions .",
    "those predictions now need to be viewed with suspicion .",
    "although the scalar form factor is well determined for elastic scattering , it is dangerous to assume that this form factor is universal and can predict production processes .",
