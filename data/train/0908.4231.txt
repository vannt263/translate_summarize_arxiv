    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) addresses the so - called @xmath0-problem of the mssm  @xcite , whose origin we describe below :    any supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( sm ) generalizes in a unique way  as dictated by supersymmetry  the interactions involving dimensionless gauge- and yukawa couplings , whereas the electroweak scale originates from the softly supersymmetry breaking mass terms and trilinear interactions ( of the order @xmath1 ) .",
    "the mssm , however , requires the introduction of a _ supersymmetric _ ( susy ) mass term for the higgs multiplets , the so - called @xmath0-term : both complex higgs scalars @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the mssm have to be components of chiral superfields which contain , in addition , fermionic @xmath4-doublets @xmath5 and @xmath6 . some of the @xmath4-components of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are electrically charged .",
    "together with with the fermionic superpartners of the @xmath7  bosons , they constitute the so - called chargino sector ( two charged dirac fermions ) of the susy extension of the sm . due to the fruitless searches for a chargino at lep , the lighter chargino has to have a mass above @xmath8  gev @xcite . analysing the chargino mass matrix",
    ", this lower limit implies that a dirac mass @xmath0 for @xmath5 and  @xmath6  for arbitrary other parameters  has to satisfy the constraint @xmath9  gev .",
    "a dirac mass term is not among the soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms , hence @xmath0 has to be a _",
    "supersymmetric _ mass term for the higgs multiplets .",
    "in addition , an analysis of the higgs potential shows that a non - vanishing soft susy breaking term @xmath10 is a necessary condition so that _ both",
    "_ neutral components of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are non - vanishing at the minimum .",
    "this , in turn , is required in order to generate masses both for up - type quarks and down - type quarks by the higgs mechanism .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath11 should be roughly of the order of the electroweak scale  ( @xmath12 )",
    ".    however , @xmath13 must not be too large : the higgs potential must be unstable at its origin @xmath14 in order to generate the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "whereas negative soft susy breaking mass terms for @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the order of the susy breaking scale @xmath1 can generate such a desired instability , the @xmath0-induced masses squared for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are always positive , and must _ not _ dominate the negative soft susy breaking mass terms .",
    "consequently the @xmath0  parameter must obey @xmath15 .",
    "hence , both `` natural '' values @xmath16 and @xmath0 very large ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) are ruled out , and the need for an explanation of @xmath19 is the @xmath0-problem .    within the nmssm ,",
    "@xmath0 is generated in a way similar to the quark- and lepton masses with the help of a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar field : one introduces a yukawa coupling @xmath20 of the higgsinos @xmath5 and  @xmath6 to a scalar field @xmath21 ( a gauge singlet , since the @xmath0-parameter carries no gauge quantum numbers ) , and arranges that the vev @xmath22 is of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "this is easy to obtain with the help of soft susy breaking negative masses squared ( or trilinear couplings ) of the order of @xmath1 for @xmath21 ; then , @xmath1 is the only scale in the theory . in this sense",
    ", the nmssm is the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm in which the weak scale is generated by the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath1 only .",
    "it should be mentioned that additional attractive features of the mssm  the unification of the running gauge couplings at @xmath23  gev and the possibility to explain the dark matter relic density  remain unchanged .",
    "the superpotential @xmath24 of the nmssm depends on the additional gauge singlet superfield  @xmath21 , and is obtained from the superpotential @xmath25 of the mssm by the following substitutions : w_mssm & = & h_u h_d  +  + w_nmssm & = & s h_u h_d + s^3  +  and similarly for the soft susy breaking terms : h_u h_d  +  s h_u h_d + s^3 +     the term @xmath26 in @xmath24 serves to stabilize the potential for the scalar singlet field @xmath21 ; a possibly negative susy breaking mass term @xmath27 ( together with @xmath28 + h.c . ) can easily generate a vev @xmath29 . comparing @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 one finds an effective @xmath0-term with @xmath30 .    discarding the goldstone bosons ,",
    "the particle content of the higgs sector of the nmssm consists in 3 cp - even neutral scalars @xmath31 , 2  cp - odd neutral scalars @xmath32 , 1 charged higgs scalar @xmath33 , and  together with the neutral gauginos  5 neutralinos @xmath34 .",
    "( the singlet - like states @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 mix with the @xmath4-doublets and the neutral gauginos ; the decomposition of the eigenstates depend on the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . )",
    "it is important to note that the lightest cp - odd scalar @xmath41 can be quite light , notably in the case of an approximate @xmath42-symmetry in the higgs sector ( @xmath39 , @xmath43 ) or peccei - quinn - symmetry ( @xmath44 ) , in which case it plays the rle of a ( pseudo- ) goldstone boson .",
    "as a result of the new states and mixings in the higgs and neutralino sectors , the corresponding phenomenology of the nmssm can differ considerably from the mssm .",
    "already the lep constraints from higgs boson searches have to be interpreted anew .",
    "the results of the four lep experiments searching for a higgs scalar decaying into @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( assuming sm branching fractions ) have been combined by the lep - higgs working group  @xcite and are shown in  fig .  1 .",
    "there , @xmath47 denotes the reduced coupling of a higgs scalar to the @xmath48 boson ( compared to the coupling of the sm higgs scalar ) , @xmath49 .",
    "shown are upper bounds on @xmath50 as function of a scalar higgs mass @xmath51 .",

    "one can note a light excess of events for @xmath52  gev ( of @xmath53 statistical significance ) , which is difficult to explain in the sm .",
    "the nmssm offers two possible explanations for this excess of events : i ) a higgs scalar with a mass of @xmath54  gev can have a reduced coupling to the @xmath48 boson ( @xmath55 ) due to its large singlet component ; or ii ) a higgs scalar with a mass of @xmath54  gev can have a reduced branching ratio into @xmath56 , @xmath46 , since it decays dominantly into a pair of light cp - odd scalars with a @xmath57 . in the latter case",
    ", the coupling of @xmath58 to @xmath48 bosons can be sm - like . in  @xcite",
    ", it has been argued that this scenario allows to alleviate the `` little finetuning problem '' of supersymmetric extensions of the sm ( since @xmath59  gev is not required ) .",
    "however , the lep experiments have also searched for @xmath60  @xcite , and the constraints are very strong for @xmath52  gev . on the other hand , if @xmath61 is below the @xmath56 threshold of @xmath62  gev , @xmath41 would decay dominantly into @xmath46 .",
    "lep constraints on @xmath63 impose no bounds for @xmath52  gev  @xcite ; hence @xmath64  gev is an attractive scenario .      for @xmath66",
    "gev , decays @xmath67 are kinematically possible .",
    "the corresponding branching ratios depend on @xmath61 , and the coupling @xmath68 of @xmath41 to @xmath69-quarks .",
    "it is useful to define a reduced coupling @xmath70 , and for large @xmath71 one can obtain @xmath72 in the nmssm .    in the range @xmath73  gev where @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) would be dominant",

    ", the @xmath83 @xmath56 bound states ( @xmath84 ) can mix with @xmath41 , since these states have the same quantum numbers  @xcite , and the mixing elements / eigenvalues of the @xmath85 mass matrix can be determined in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the measured mass by babar of the @xmath78-like state must correspond to one of these eigenvalues . on the one hand , this implies that @xmath61 can not be equal to @xmath86  gev , if the mixing ( which is proportional to @xmath77 ) is large : for a large mixing , an eigenvalue of a @xmath87 matrix ( of the @xmath88 system ) can not coincide with one of its diagonal elements .",
    "this reasoning implies an upper bound on @xmath77 for @xmath61 near 9.39  gev . in fig .",
    "2 we show upper bounds on @xmath77 in the nmssm from cleo ( black ) , the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath89 ( blue ) , @xmath90-physics ( green ) and constraints due to the measured @xmath91 mass by babar as a red line ( from  @xcite ) .     versus @xmath61 in the nmssm .",
    "indicated are constraints from @xmath90-physics as a green dashed line , constraints from @xmath89 as a blue dashed line , the bounds from cleo on @xmath92 as a black line and constraints due to the measured @xmath91 mass by babar as a red line ; from@xcite . ]    on the other hand , the average value for the hyperfine splitting @xmath93 found by babar  @xcite is somewhat large : @xmath94 this result can be compared to recent predictions from perturbative qcd : @xmath95 @xcite and @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "whereas an explanation of the discrepancy between ( [ ehfsexp ] ) and perturbative qcd is not excluded at present , the difference might be ascribed to the mixing of the @xmath91 state with a light pseudoscalar higgs @xmath41 , if @xmath61 is somewhat above 9.4  gev .",
    "( for @xmath97  gev , @xmath77 is bounded from above just by the red line in fig .  2 . ) the assumption that the @xmath91-@xmath41 mixing explains the discrepancy between ( [ ehfsexp ] ) and perturbative qcd , allows to determine @xmath77 and hence all eigenvalues and mixing angles in the @xmath83-@xmath41-system as function of  @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "then , the masses of the states interpreted as @xmath98 and @xmath99 can also be modified .",
    "furthermore , all @xmath83 states can acquire non - negligible branching ratios into @xmath46 due to their mixing with @xmath41 .    in fig .  3 ( from @xcite ) ,",

    "not far above 9.4  gev the effects of the mixing on the states @xmath104 and @xmath105 are negligible , but for larger @xmath61 the spectrum can differ considerably from the expectations from qcd - based quark models .    [",
    "fig : heavy_masses ]    future experiments at @xmath90 factories could verify this scenario in different ways : through the spectrum of the @xmath83-@xmath41-system beyond the @xmath91-state seen by babar , and/or through a violation of lepton universality in inclusive @xmath65 decays @xmath106 : from @xmath107 one would expect an excess in the @xmath46 final state  @xcite .",
    "if a sm - like higgs boson @xmath58 decays dominantly into a pair of light pseudoscalars with @xmath109  gev ( such that @xmath41 decays dominantly into @xmath46 ) , the detection of @xmath58 will be quite difficult at the lhc : the final state from @xmath110 will contain four @xmath111 neutrinos , which escape undetected and make it difficult to observe peaks in invariant masses corresponding to @xmath41 or @xmath58 ; two @xmath111 leptons at a time ( originating from one @xmath41 boson ) will be nearly collinear , and the average @xmath112 of the particles in the final state is quite low .",
    "important backgrounds originate from @xmath113 production and heavy flavour jets .    up to now , the following proposals for @xmath58 searches at the lhc in this scenario have been made :    \\(i ) in @xcite it has been proposed to consider diffractive higgs production ( @xmath114 ) in order to be sensitive to @xmath115 , which requires to install additional forward detectors . using a track - based analysis in which all events with more than 6 tracks in the central region are discarded",
    ", a viable signal seems possible after accumulating 300  fb@xmath116 of integrated luminosity .",
    "\\(ii ) proposals for signals and cuts appropriate for the @xmath117jets final state have been made in @xcite ; with 100  fb@xmath116 of integrated luminosity , the expected rates after cuts are @xmath118 from @xmath58  production via vector boson fusion , and @xmath119 from @xmath58  production via higgs strahlung ( @xmath120 ) where one can trigger on a lepton from @xmath7 decays .",
    "\\(iii ) in @xcite , the subdominant @xmath121 final state ( with @xmath122 from direct @xmath41 decays ) was discussed : in spite of the small branching fraction it was argued that , for @xmath123  gev and with @xmath58 being produced via gluon - gluon fusion , the tevatron can see a signal over the background for an integrated luminosity @xmath124  fb@xmath116 , and the lhc already for @xmath125  fb@xmath116 .",
    "further details of current atlas and cms studies of bench mark scenarios including the @xmath126 final state can be found in  @xcite .",
    "as in the mssm , one can assume universal soft susy breaking masses and trilinear couplings at the gut or planck scale , which is motivated by a gravitational ( flavour blind ) origin for these terms in minimal supergravity . then , all soft susy breaking terms ( including those involving the singlet in the nmssm ) are specified by universal gaugino masses @xmath127 , universal scalar masses @xmath128 and universal trilinear couplings @xmath129 at a large scale .",
    "the constrained nmssm ( cnmssm ) has the same number of free parameters as the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) : the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath90 of the cmssm are replaced by the yukawa couplings @xmath20 , @xmath38 of the cnmssm .",
    "the allowed ranges of the parameters @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the cmssm have been widely discussed in the literature ; it turns out that these ranges are very different in the cnmssm  @xcite : in order to obtain a non - vanishing vev @xmath130 in the nmssm , the soft susy breaking mass @xmath131 must not be large and positive .",
    "since @xmath131 is hardly renormalized between the gut and the weak scale , the same condition applies to @xmath132 in the cnmssm . in the cmssm ,",
    "small values of @xmath128 ( compared to @xmath127 ) lead to a charged stau ( @xmath133 ) lsp , which is ruled out . in the cnmssm , an additional singlino - like neutralino @xmath134 can have a mass below the @xmath133  mass and be the true lsp . in order to give the correct ( not too large ) dark matter relic density , @xmath135 must be just a few gev below @xmath136 , such that the @xmath134 relic density can be reduced via co - annihilation with the @xmath133 nlsp .",
    "the latter condition fixes @xmath129 in terms of @xmath127 .",
    "finally lep constraints on the higgs sector lead to an upper bound on @xmath20 of @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "hence , the full higgs and sparticle spectrum depends essentially on @xmath127 only .",
    "a preferred range for @xmath127 can be obtained by computing the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath89 as a function of @xmath127 , and requiring that the supersymmetric contributions explain the deviation @xmath138 between the result of the e821 experiment at bnl  @xcite and the sm  @xcite . the result for @xmath139",

    "the nature of the lightest cp - even higgs scalar depends on @xmath127 : for @xmath150  gev , @xmath149 is dominantly singlet - like which allows to satisfy lep constraints even for a mass well below 114  gev . the next - to - lightest state @xmath151 , for @xmath150  gev , is sm - like with a mass just above 115  gev . for @xmath152  gev , the situation is reversed : here @xmath151 is dominantly singlet - like , and the lightest cp - even higgs scalar @xmath149 is sm - like with a mass up to 120  gev for @xmath153  tev .",
    "an interesting scenario is possible for @xmath154  gev , where @xmath155  gev and the reduced coupling @xmath156 of the singlet - like @xmath149 ( for not too small @xmath157 ) is @xmath158  @xcite : in this case a production of @xmath149 at lep could explain the excess of events at lep as discussed before .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath151 with its mass just above 114  gev could generate an even slighter excess of events in this mass range , which has equally been observed  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of the nearly pure singlino - like @xmath134 lsp in the cnmssm on sparticle decay chains are important : first , each sparticle decay cascade will end up in the next - to - lightest @xmath42-odd particle , the charged @xmath133 in the present case .",
    "only subsequently the @xmath133 will decay as @xmath159 , leading to at least one @xmath111 lepton per sparticle .",
    "notably , if the @xmath160 mass difference is small and/or @xmath20 is very small ( in which case the couplings to @xmath134 become tiny ) , the @xmath133 width can become so small that the @xmath133 decay length becomes @xmath161(mm - cm )  @xcite .",
    "such displaced vertices can also appear in scenarios with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking where , however , the decay lengths are rather of @xmath162(m ) .",
    "hence , dedicated simulations of the sparticle signatures at colliders in the cnmssm will be required .",
    "assuming that the susy breaking scale @xmath1 generates the weak scale @xmath163 ( i.e. that no dimensionful terms as @xmath0 are present in the superpotential ) , the nmssm is the most natural supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "its simplest version , the cnmssm ( with soft susy breaking terms from msugra ) , could explain the @xmath164 excess of events in higgs searches at lep , in contrast to the cmssm .",
    "due to @xmath165 , its sparticle spectrum would be very different from the cmssm : the lsp @xmath134 is singlino - like , but every sparticle decay chain contains a @xmath133 decaying , in turn , into @xmath166 .",
    "this last decay can lead to macroscopically displaced vertices .    in the general nmssm , a light cp - odd scalar @xmath41 with @xmath167  gev",
    "could ( i ) explain the @xmath164 excess of events at lep ; ( ii ) alleviate the `` little finetuning problem '' of supersymmetric extensions of the sm , and ( iii ) explain a low @xmath78 mass as measured by babar .",
