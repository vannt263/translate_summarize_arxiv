    "this ratio increases to @xmath44 near the central co source ( c1 in shen & lo s map ) , and could be even larger in the northern @xmath5co source .",
    "the minor differences between the @xmath3co and @xmath5co maps seem hardly compatible with the large ones reported by loiseau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that their analysis is based on ( 2@xmath21 ) data so that a direct comparison is not possible .    comparing our @xmath3co(1@xmath20 ) with the hcn(1@xmath20 ) map of brouillet & schilke ( @xcite ) we find an overall resemblance of the large - scale distribution , but also significant differences .",
    "mainly , the central source is much more pronounced in all velocity channels in hcn than in @xmath3co ; conversely the lobes appear dimmer . the faint 50  kms@xmath6 extension south of the nucleus and the arc - like structure @xmath45 west of the nucleus , discussed in the next section , are also discernable , though less clearly .",
    "the @xmath3co data cast doubts on the standard picture of a circumnuclear molecular torus .",
    "firstly , the emission in fig .",
    "[ fig : int13co ] is strongly asymmetric with respect to the major and minor axes .",
    "secondly , an edge - on torus should appear quite differently in the optically thin @xmath3co line and in the optically thick @xmath5co line .",
    "the @xmath3co(1@xmath20 ) line , for which @xmath46 ( wild et al .",
    "@xcite ) , should exhibit limb - brightening , i.e.  two distant lobes , whereas the optically thick @xmath5co line ( @xmath47 ) should show a more uniform distribution , and emphasize the near side of the torus .",
    "instead , we observe remarkably similar distributions , which suggests that the co is mostly concentrated in two or three sources .",
    "the observations seem better interpreted in terms of molecular gas condensations located at the ends and in the middle of a stellar bar .",
    "such condensations or `` armlets '' have already been observed in several galaxies , including ( reynaud & downes @xcite ) and ( garca - burillo & gulin @xcite ) ; achtermann & lacy ( @xcite ) and larkin et al .  ( @xcite ) have already proposed a similar model in order to explain the optical forbidden lines at the centre of m82 .",
    "we will see in the next sections that the kinematical data support this interpretation .",
    "[ fig : velfi ] shows the velocity field derived from @xmath3co(1@xmath20 ) ( first order moment ) , superimposed on the integrated intensity map .",
    "the dominant rotation pattern shows the eastern side receding ( red - shifted ) and the western side approaching ( blue - shifted ) .",
    "there is a strong velocity gradient around the dynamical centre ( offset ( 0,0 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : velfi ] ) , and the iso - velocity contours are systematically tilted by @xmath48 with respect to the minor axis .",
    "this tilt is visible along the whole major axis of m82 , suggesting that the gas flow is driven by a non - axisymmetrical potential within the inner 500pc . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity field is rather asymmetric , possibly due to the tidal interaction with .",
    "a detailed analysis of individual features is thus difficult  even the inclination of the disk to the line of sight is hard to determine ; analyses of the outer disk and the outflow cones suggest a value of @xmath49 ( gtz et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the position angle ( _ pa _ ) of the major axis is slightly varying depending on the tracer and method used .",
    "that of the optical disk is usually given as @xmath50 , but gtz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used @xmath51 for their thorough kinematical analysis of the optical emission lines .",
    "other angles are also used , e.g.  achtermann & lacy ( @xcite ) use @xmath52 in the analysis of their neii data .",
    "we re - determined the position of the kinematical major axis of the molecular gas from our data cube together with the position of the dynamical centre ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : velfi ] ) .",
    "pa _ of this axis is @xmath53 , @xmath54 different from that of the outer disk .",

    "[ fig : posvel ] shows the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagramme taken along the major axis ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "emission can be traced from @xmath59  kms@xmath6 to @xmath60  kms@xmath6 .",
    "this implies a rotation speed  _ if this reflects simple rotation _  of @xmath61  kms@xmath6 , exactly the same figure as derived by shen & lo ( @xcite ) . we would then obtain the same indicative mass for the central @xmath62  pc region of as shen & lo ( @xmath63 m@xmath64 )",
    "although the @xmath3co brightness distribution is very asymmetric , the main pattern of the p - v diagramme and the ridge of terminal frequencies are rather symmetric with respect to the dynamical centre .",
    "we note that emission from gas at high velocities is detected on both sides of the nucleus , although with a higher intensity for @xmath65 .",
    "the rotation curve derived from the terminal - velocities method applied to p - v diagramme is very steep : we estimate @xmath66kms@xmath6 at @xmath67pc . from @xmath68pc to @xmath69pc the estimated rotation curve stays flat ( @xmath70kms@xmath6 ) and reaches a relative maximum of @xmath71kms@xmath6 at @xmath72pc . the rotation curve ( @xmath73 ) and the related principal frequencies derived in the epicyclic approximation ( @xmath74 and @xmath74-@xmath75/2 ) are represented in fig .  [ fig : omega ] for the inner 500pc .",
    "a large amount of gas is detected at velocities lower than determined by the ridge of terminal velocities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : posvel ] .",
    "there is an s - shaped feature in the p - v diagramme going across the dynamical centre ( denoted as sp in fig .",
    "[ fig : posvel ] ) .",
    "the characteristic pattern of sp suggests the presence of a non - axisymmetric distribution of molecular gas in the form of nuclear mini - spiral arms , which extend from the centre to @xmath76pc .",
    "moreover , the ` figure - eight ' pattern of the p - v diagramme formed by sp and the curve of terminal velocities is typical of a bar - driven gas flow ( kuijken & merrifield @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a nuclear stellar bar of 1kpc diameter was already established by telesco & gezari ( @xcite ) , based on near - infrared observations in the j , k and i bands .",
    "driven by a bar potential , gas clouds follow non self - intersecting ellipsoidal orbits . the major axes of these orbits precess as a function of radius , and hence end up delineating spiral arms , owing to orbit crowding .",
    "the precession of gas orbits is due to the dissipative nature of gas : molecular cloud - cloud collisions and the implied viscosity of the process cause a smooth transition between the bar - driven @xmath77 orbits ( parallel to the bar major axis ) towards @xmath78 orbits ( perpendicular to bar major axis ) , when we go across the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of a nuclear bar potential and a spiral gas response are intimately related .    the existence of two ilrs in the nucleus of is clearly suggested by our observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] ) .",
    "the ring - like appearance of the integrated intensity map ( referred to in the literature as the molecular gas torus ) indicates gas accumulation towards the outer ilr ( oilr ) at @xmath79pc caused by the action of gravitational torques by the stellar bar on the gas .",
    "if we assume that corotation of the stellar bar is located near its end - points ( @xmath80pc ) , we derive a bar pattern speed of @xmath81kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 and from it , the location of two ilrs at @xmath82(iilr)@xmath83pc and @xmath82(oilr)@xmath84pc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : omega ] ) .",
    "the onset of a fast bar instability in the nucleus of is hardly surprising in view of the measured high values of @xmath85 within the inner 500pc .",
    "results of recent near - infrared surveys of galactic centres show that nuclear bar instabilities are ubiquitous and that the pattern speeds of these m=2 instabilities can reach high values on the derived kinematical major axis ( see the case of : garca - burillo et al .",
    "the final output would be the formation of a two - arm gaseous trailing spiral across the oilr .",
    "the tilting of isovelocity contours towards the centre , the ring - like concentration of molecular gas and the ` figure - eight ' pattern of the major axis p - v plot support this theoretical scenario for the nucleus of .",
    "the steep negative - velocity feature between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which is linked to the bar , was also observed in hcn(1@xmath20 ) by brouillet & schilke ( @xcite ) and in @xmath5co ( 1@xmath20 ) by shen & lo ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is more pronounced in hcn than in @xmath5co or @xmath3co , which probably denotes that the gas near the centre of the bar is dense .",
    "this steep negative - velocity feature merges into the western lobe at @xmath88 , leaving a prominent hole in the p - v diagramme at @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "this `` hole '' is also visible in the velocity - channel maps of fig .",
    "[ fig : chann13 ] , where it appears as a @xmath91-wide gap between the western lobe and the central source and centred at @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig : arcchann ] shows a close - up view of velocity - channel maps around this hole .",
    "a faint arc - like structure ( diameter @xmath93 , or 130  pc ) delineates the southern border of the hole , while only very weak emission is visible to the north ( at @xmath94 kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "the hole happens to host the young snr 41.9 + 58 which is the strongest compact radio source in m  82 ( kronberg et al .",
    "this snr is however assumed to be only about 40 years old ( wilkinson & de bruyn @xcite ) and hence can not be the origin of such a large structure .",
    "we note that the arc - like structure and the hole are also visible in the @xmath5co velocity - channel maps shown by lo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( e.g.  in their map at @xmath95  kms@xmath6 , which corresponds to @xmath96  kms@xmath6 ) .    the gas in the co hole seems largely ionized . the h41@xmath97 ( seaquist et al .",
    "@xcite ) and h@xmath98 ( seaquist et al .",
    "@xcite ) recombination line emissions show both a maximum , and the @xmath99 wide associated hii region fills the hole in our @xmath3co channel maps .",
    "the 3  mm continuum emission , which is essentially thermal free - free radiation , also peaks at this position . as concerns molecular lines , wild et al .",

    "the maximum of the atomic ci line falls close to this location ( white et al .",
    "those authors also argued that the enhanced ci abundance in the central region of can be connected to a higher cosmic ray flux there .",
    "copious cosmic rays could be delivered e.g.  by the luminous compact source 41.9 + 58 .",
    "furthermore , as noted by wild et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the secondary peak in the 2.2@xmath101 m image as well as the fir and submm dust emission peaks ( joy et al .",
    "@xcite ; smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) are found right there , and the maxima of the [ neii ] line ( achtermann & lacy @xcite ) are both close to this position . finally , a recent high - resolution map at 408mhz ( wills et al .",
    "@xcite ) clearly shows an emission - free circle of 100pc diameter , right around this source , which is ascribed to a large photoionized zone .",
    "a realistic interpretation is that this is a region with an intense radiation field in which the atomic hydrogen has been ionized ( see wills et al .",
    "such a region might have been created by a large cluster of massive stars whose stellar winds and supernova explosions ( of which 41.9 + 58 is just the latest ) can easily clear a large hole in the interstellar matter . therein hot gas will be the dominant constituent and the intense radiation of the remaining stars will dissociate molecules unless they are shielded within dense clouds .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that the gas deficiency is less pronounced here in the hcn line ( sect .",
    "[ sec : line13co ] ) .",
    "in order to try to understand the remarkable morphology and kinematics of the central 700  pc region we briefly describe what could have happened since the probable close encounter of with .",
    "cottrell ( @xcite ) interpreted the observed large - scale kinematics of the neutral hydrogen gas in terms of tidal disruption of this gas from during the passage of on a hyperbolic orbit .",
    "the fact that the kinematic axis of the hi surrounding lies parallel to the major axis was seen as evidence for the captured gas to be in a polar orbit around . in this picture",
    ", gas would eventually fall into the centre of and thus feed the starburst of this presumably former gas - poor galaxy .",
    "recently , yun et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have proposed the opposite scenario : the large hi streamers which they have found are interpreted as gas torn out of the outer gas - rich hi disk of .",
    "the question arises how in this case gas is transported to the centre to feed the starburst .",
    "there is of course no contradiction because the tidal forces that are responsible for gas disruption in the outer disk of will also have caused instabilities in the gas orbiting in its inner part .",
    "it is well known that tidal interactions induce the rapid formation of bars along which gas can then be transported to the central regions of the galaxies . in view of this , the hypothesis of yun et al",
    ".   seems more attractive , because in this scenario gas may be transported more efficiently to the centre of than from a polar orbit .",
    "we therefore investigate in the following whether the observed kinematics of the @xmath3co emission is consistent with this view .",
    "the maps tracing the molecular gas in have been mostly interpreted in terms of a rotating molecular torus ( e.g.  nakai et al .",
    "@xcite ; loiseau et al .",
    "@xcite ; shen & lo @xcite ) . as pointed out in sect .",
    "[ sec : line13co ] , the @xmath3co high resolution maps reveal a patchy gas distribution and a disturbed kinematics characteristic of gas in orbit around a stellar bar .",
    "the bar forces the outer gas to flow towards the central region , where it is exposed to the intense radiation field produced by the starburst and becomes largely dissociated .",
    "this is when the denser and better shielded clouds get shaped into the two lobes and the central condensation of fig .  3 .",
    "we have compared several p - v diagrammes and find that they support this picture .",
    "these are : @xmath3co ( fig .",

    "5 ) , and hcn ( brouillet & schilke @xcite ; their fig .  5",
    "; shen & lo @xcite ; their fig .  4 ) .",
    "from this we summarize the following : the brightest [ ne ii ] emission peaks ( concentrated between @xmath102 and @xmath103 around @xmath104kms@xmath6 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pvcomp ] ) coincide with depressions in @xmath3co .",
    "the same holds true for the radio recombination lines , which shows that the effect does not just result from visual extinction variations .",
    "finally , hco@xmath100(1@xmath20 ) closely follows the @xmath3co emission and hcn(1@xmath20 ) is brighter near the nucleus and shows little evidence of a hole @xmath45 w of it .",
    "the velocity - integrated emission maps of these lines show that the tracers of current star formation and the ionized gas are confined to radii of @xmath105 , which is also seen in the 3-mm continuum ( free - free radiation ) and the mid - infrared , the latter reflecting the heating of dust by young stars ( telesco & gezari @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the bulk of the co gas is located beyond @xmath106 .",
    "the gas traced by the hcn molecule resides in very dense clouds that are better shielded against the radiation field .",

    "the complex kinematic structure unveiled in previous studies is confirmed . together with the asymmetric morphology of the observed distribution of the molecular gas it makes it difficult to maintain the hypothesis of an edge - on molecular torus , an idea advanced when the first low - resolution single - dish maps of the co gas in the centre of became available .",
    "we rather propose that what we observe is the signature of a bar , the central ( projected ) 200  pc portion of which is relatively void of co gas and probably subject to strong dissociation .",

    "it also hosts the young snr 41.9 + 58 .",
    "we think that this co hole reflects a bubble inside which the gas is ionized and the molecules dissociated .",

    "<S> using the iram interferometer , we have observed the nearby starburst galaxy m82 with a @xmath0 resolution ( @xmath1 pc ) in the 1@xmath20 line of @xmath3co and in the @xmath4 2.6-mm continuum .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the @xmath3co line shows the same gross features as the @xmath5co(1@xmath20 ) map of shen & lo ( @xcite ) , namely two lobes and a compact central source , though with different relative intensities . </S>",
    "<S> the lobes are more conspicuous and the central source is fainter in @xmath3co than in @xmath5co .    </S>",
    "<S> the velocity field observed around the nucleus shows a very steep gradient ( 140 kms@xmath6 over 75pc ) , which is very probably caused by the stellar bar visible in the near infrared . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical centre coincides with the ir peak and is shifted @xmath7 north - east of the compact @xmath3co source . </S>",
    "<S> the two co lobes appear to be associated with the ends of the bar and not with a molecular ring , as usually assumed . </S>",
    "<S> they are probably shaped by the strong uv radiation from the central region . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3co must be more photodissociated than the self - shielded @xmath5co molecules in the central @xmath8250  pc region , which may explain the relative weakness of the @xmath3co central source .    </S>",
    "<S> a 130 pc - wide bubble of molecular gas has been identified , which happens to host the most luminous compact radio source in m82 . </S>",
    "<S> it lies 120 pc west of the ir peak between the central source and the western lobe and seems characterized by warmer gas , strong uv radio free - free radiation , and an enhanced cosmic ray production rate . </S>"
