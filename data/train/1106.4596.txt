    "one of the most fruitful methods to obtain minimal surfaces in @xmath0 is by solving the dirichlet problem for minimal graphs , with possibly infinite boundary values .",
    "this method was originally introduced by h. jenkins and serrin @xcite for minimal graphs in @xmath3 , and extended to @xmath4 by b. nelli and h. rosenberg  @xcite , p. collin and h. rosenberg  @xcite , and l. mazet , h. rosenberg and the second author  @xcite .    in  @xcite , nelli and",
    "rosenberg also constructed vertical catenoids and helicoids .",
    "l. hauswirth  @xcite generalized these examples by studying all minimal surfaces foliated by horizontal constant curvature curves . in this way",
    ", he obtained a 2-parameter family of minimal riemann - type surfaces , which have genus zero and infinitely many ends .",
    "very recently , j. pyo  @xcite , f. morabito and the second author  @xcite have constructed minimal surfaces of genus zero and finite total curvature .",
    "the method of construction in both papers consists of three steps .",
    "first , one solves the jenkins - serrin problem in a suitable geodesic polygonal domain with vertices @xmath5 , satisfying @xmath6 in @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the infinite boundary of @xmath7 ( that we will denote as @xmath9 ) secondly , one uses the conjugation introduced by b. daniel @xcite and hauswirth , r. sa earp and e. toubiana @xcite to obtain a minimal graph bounded by @xmath10 planar geodesics of the surface ( not ambient geodesics in @xmath0 ) , all of them at the same height .",
    "the complete surface is obtained by doubling the previous graph using schwarz reflection principle with respect the horizontal slice that contains the horizontal geodesics ( see figure [ fig : karcher-5 ] ) .",
    "the main theorem of this paper shows that it is possible to take limits in the method of construction described in the above paragraph .",
    "moreover , we have an important control of this limit surface , in such a way we can prescribe the topology of the resulting minimal surface .",
    "this control also allows us to guarantee that the limit set of distinct ends are disjoint . regarding the conformal structure ,",
    "the examples can be constructed with _ parabolic _",
    "conformal type .",
    "this is not rare , because in some sense the minimal surfaces that we construct are limits of minimal surfaces with finite total curvature .",
