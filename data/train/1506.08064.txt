    "thus , it is anticipated that the magnetic field brought a structural anisotropy in the pb(ii)-doped silica hydorgels during the preparation .",

    "the transport of materials in the gels depends on the structure .",

    "if pore size is highly controlled uniformly , the filtering of the column must be improved .",
    "one can intuitively realize anisotropy in mechanical and/or thermomechanical properties due to the anisotropic structure . as described in a monograph @xcite and reported in literatures such as refs .",
    "@xcite , one can control the structure of silica gels by the selection of starting materials , ph control of the solvent , solvent exchange during polymerization stage , and aging .",

    "that a magnetic moment is included in a group of the main chain , the main chains align parallel @xcite .",
    "because silica is diamagnetic , one can not imagine the alignment of silica polymers due to direct interaction with a magnetic field . in a previous paper @xcite , basically base on the results of birefringence measurement and the discussions on a likely mechanism of interaction with the magnetic field",

    "there have been an interest in the structure of scale around several tens or a few hundreds of nanometers .",
    "pores of such scale have been reported in silica aerogels @xcite and commercial gels for column chromatography @xcite . also , along with fractal nature , which were more often reported for silica xerogels ( such as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , such scales were observed in silica hydrogels @xcite .",
    "it is natural to imagine the existence of closed loops of the same scale in the hydrogels .",
    "let us remember the presence of pb@xmath5 ions and that the skeletons made of silicon and oxygen atoms possess a lot of dangling bonds in hydrogels .",
    "we speculate ring currents along close loops due to complexes formed on such skeletons with pb@xmath5 ions through a mechanism similar to that of electric conduction of the conjugated polymers @xcite and the force tending to direct those rings perpendicular to the magnetic field . in this way , providing a positive intrinsic birefringence of silica , in ref .",

    "then , electrons were irradiated to the samples in a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) environment .",
    "we observed the samples by a tem ( hitachi h-9000nar ) .",
    "we should note on the difference between the mechanisms for crystallization in those two kinds of experiments . in the former ,",

    "it is speculated that order of the underlaying gel networks or that of self - similar network structure whose scale is less than that affects to the outer form of the precipitates must influences the crystallinity of precipitates ( discussion with regard to the fractal nature of the gel network on micropore scale will be given later ) .",
    "it may result in faceting behavior ; however , fig .",
    "[ fig : ei ] does not possess a sufficient resolution .",

    "this situation occurs in general . along with the fact that the pore in the network only give the upper limit of the precipitate dimension ,",

    "@xcite is carried as fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] .",
    "the inset is a logarithmic gaussian distribution spectra of the relaxation times ( @xmath10 ) for autocorrelation functions of the electric field of scattered light .",
    "peaks appear in the rage of millisecond for both samples .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath11 of the corrective diffusion mode is usually estimated by fitting by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the scattering vector . since the working wavelength in this measurement was @xmath16 = 532 nm , @xmath13 = @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the scattering angle",
    "is evaluated as @xmath19 m@xmath20 for @xmath18 = @xmath9 @xcite ( @xmath21 is the diffactive index of the media ) .",
    "therefore , for the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] one can estimate @xmath11 on the order of @xmath22 m@xmath23/sec . owing to the stokes - einstein relation",
    "@xmath24 the corresponding characteristic length @xmath25 is roughly estimated as one hundred and several tens of nanometers or a few hundreds of nanometers , where @xmath26 is the temperature multiplied by boltzmann s constant and @xmath27 the viscosity coefficient of the solvent . taking into consideration a note that the estimate of 80 nm was underestimated ,",
    "this characteristic length is speculated to correspond to a long axis of elongated pores .",
    "the present concern has been limited to the direction of magnetic alignment in a scale of micropore .",
    "pore size distribution has not been determined . if there is a fractal nature in the scale under consideration , to determine the distribution around a mean value is meaningless because of a scale - free property .",
    "the dimension of nanocrystallites was not limited only by the compartment within the micropores .",
    "even if one can determine the nanocrystallite size distribution , it unnecessarily coincide to the pore size distribution .",
    "we conclude that the silica gel networks align along the magnetic field .",
    "this conclusion is opposite to that of ref .",
    "this is , however , consistent with a recent result on the sign of measure of birefringence of silica hydrogels prepared in a magnetic field of various strengths @xcite .",
    "we have also overturned a conclusion on the sign of birefringence of ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vessels used as sample cells were cylindrical tube made of borosilicate glass . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we performed the same measurements using square cross - sectional cells made of both borosilicate glass and quartz .",
    "special cares were payed to selection of cells so that the optical path difference of empty cells was on the order of @xmath28 nm . nevertheless , obtained results were qualitatively different from each other .",
    "the former indicted decreasing property of @xmath29 and negative birefringence was measured for @xmath2 @xmath30 5 t. a negative birefringence on the order of @xmath4 was not reproduced for 5 t samples . instead , negative birefringence on the order of @xmath31 was measured for 7 t and 10 t samples .",
    "however , we infer that the resultant negative birefringence was attributed to the effect of the borosilicate glass cell wall @xcite .",
    "it is known that borosilicate glasses include a lot of impurities , and thus the cell wall surfaces are not featureless .",
    "therefore , alignment of silica chains is affected by the surface structure and/or other unexpected factors due to impurities .",
    "on the other hand , a trend of positive birefringence was seen in the latter .",
    "effect of cell wall on the alignment of silica chains is expected to be smaller for quartz glass than for borosilicate glass . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have reinvestigated the results for quartz cells and overturned the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite on the sign of birefringence .",
    "that is , the silica hydrogels prepared in a high magnetic field have a positive birefringence with the optic axis along the direction of magnetic field .",
    "providing a positive intrinsic birefringence , one reaches to a conclusion that silica chains tend to align parallel to the magnetic field    let us discuss the mechanism of magnetic alignment of the silica network in hydrogels . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assumed excitation of soliton type , such as for conducting polymers @xcite , on silica chain with presence on pb@xmath32 ions and this excitation plays a role of electric conduction carrier .",
    "ring currents on loops in gel networks make magnetic moments perpendicular to the loops .",
    "accordingly , the loops tend to align perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "now , we point that excitation is not limited to such type ; excitation accompanying magnetic moments can arise .",
    "in such case , silica chains align parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "confirmation of this speculation is a subject of future researches .",
    "we wish to conclude this paper with the following sentence .",
    "a conclusion of a previous paper @xcite has been overturned : a silica gel network in pb(ii)-doped silica hydrogels aligns parallel to a magnetic field .",
    "let us close this paper with a comment on a future research .",
    "we have constructed a set up of the snarmont method with a mechanical rotating analyzer to reduce the measurement time @xcite . in previous studies",
    "@xcite , the numbers of measurement were small because the measurements were extremely time - consuming .",
    "we expect an improvement of statistics accuracy to support the conclusion on the sign , and to update the magnitude of the measure of birefringence of silica gels .",
