    "the rosenblatt process appears as limit of normalized sums of long - range dependent series ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the last years",
    ", this stochastic processes has been the object of several research papers ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite among others ) .",
    "its analysis is motivated by the fact that the rosenblatt process is self - similar with stationary increments and moreover its exhibits long - range dependence ( or long - memory ) . in this sense",
    ", it shares many properties with the more known fractional brownian motion ( fbm in the sequel ) except the fact that the rosenblatt process is not a gaussian process .",
    "recall that the fbm is the only gaussian self - similar process with stationary increments .",
    "the practical aspects of rosenblatt process are striking : it provides a new class of processes from which to model long memory , self - similarity , and hlder - regularity , allowing significant deviation from fbm and other gaussian processes .",
    "the need of non - gaussian self - similar processes in practice ( for example in hydrology ) is mentioned in the paper @xcite based on the study of stochastic modeling for river - flow time series in @xcite .",
    "the hurst parameter @xmath0 characterizes all the important properties of a rosenblatt process , as seen above .",
    "therefore , estimating @xmath0 properly is an important problem in the analysis of this process .",
    "the hurst parameter estimation from a @xmath1-length path of a fbm or more generally of self - similar or long - range dependent processes , has a long history .",
    "several statistics have been introduced and studied to this end , such as parametric estimators ( maximum likelihood estimator ) as well as semi - parametric estimators ( spectral , variogram or wavelets based estimators ) .",
    "informations on these various approaches can be found in the books of beran @xcite or doukhan _ et al .",
    "but in the particular case of the fbm , the main results concerning this estimation were certainly obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed the optimal method for estimating @xmath0 is obtained from the maximization of the whittle approximation of the log - likelihood introduced by whittle in @xcite ( in the sequel , the whittle estimator ) .",
    "this estimator shares the same asymptotic behavior than the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) , notably it is asymptotically efficient , but numerically the whittle estimator is clearly many more interesting than the mle ( no need to inverse the covariance matrix ) . these properties also hold for long memory stationary gaussian processes as it was established in @xcite and @xcite under almost general conditions : the whittle estimator is asymptotically normal with a @xmath2 convergence rate .    in the case of long memory",
    "non - gaussian time series , there exist very few results concerning the limit behavior of the whittle estimator . in @xcite , the case of fourth order moment linear processes have been considered and it was proved that the whittle estimator is still asymptotically normal with a @xmath2 convergence rate .",
    "but in @xcite , the cases of functionals of long memory gaussian processes have been studied and the conclusion is different : in general , the whittle estimator satisfies a non - central limit theorem with a non gaussian limit distribution and a convergence rate smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "this is notably the case when the functional is the hermite polynomial @xmath3 .    estimating the memory parameter of the rosenblatt process appears to be a challenging problem",
    "this is due to the fact that this process is not a gaussian process , the explicit expression of its probability density is not know and standard techniques can not be applied in this case .",
    "the development of new criteria , based on the malliavin calculus and chaos expansion into multiple wiener - it integrals ( see the monograph @xcite ) , for the convergence of sequences of random variables recently led to new results . in @xcite and @xcite the authors studied the asymptotic behavior of the quadratic variations of the rosenblatt process in order to obtain the asymptotic properties of an estimator for the self - similarity index .",
    "an approach based on wavelets has been also proposed in @xcite",
    ". a common denominator of all these works is that the estimators constructed are consistent but in general their limit behavior is not gaussian .",
    "this not very convenient for practical aspects .",
    "we want to put a new brick to the theory of the long - memory parameter estimation for non - gaussian stochastic processes .",
    "we analyze the limit behavior of the whittle estimator for the self - similarity index @xmath0 of the increments of a rosenblatt process ( where @xmath4 ) .",
    "we will see that , as in the case of the estimators based on the quadratic variations ( see @xcite ) , the whittle estimator has a non - gaussian limit behavior and the convergence rate is @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , if one compares with the fbm case , the chaos expansion of the estimator involves a new term with a strong dependence structure that can not be compensated by the smoothness of the estimator .",
    "this result is not totally surprising .",
    "indeed , from @xcite , the rosenblatt can be obtained as the limit of @xmath6 } h_2(x_k)$ ] when @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a long memory gaussian process and we know from @xcite that the whittle estimator of @xmath9 also satisfies the same kind of non- central limit theorem .",
    "unfortunately , our new result concerning the whittle estimator keeps open the following question : is it possible to propose an asymptotically gaussian estimator of the self - similarity parameter of a rosenblatt process ?",
    "however , monte - carlo experiments attests that the whittle estimator numerically provides accurate estimations , clearly better than with other well known estimators and with almost the same quality than the one obtained for the fbm when @xmath0 is close to @xmath10 .",
    "hence , even if it asymptotically satisfies a non - central limit theorem , the whittle estimator is really interesting for estimating the @xmath0 parameter of a rosenblatt process . + we organized our paper as follows .",
    "section 2 contains some preliminaries on multiple stochastic integrals , the rosenblatt process and the whittle estimator . in section 3",
    "we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the whittle estimator for the self - similarity index .",
    "finally , section [ simu ] contains a numerical study of the estimator and main proofs of this paper are established in section [ proofs ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic concepts used throughout the paper . we will present the the multiple stochastic integrals , the definition and the immediate properties of the rosenblatt process and the basic facts concerning the whittle estimator .    to begin with we call back some elements about multiple stochastic integrals .",
    "let @xmath11 be a classical wiener process on a standard probability space @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 with @xmath14 integer , we introduce the multiple wiener - it integral of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "the basic reference is the monograph @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be an elementary function with @xmath18 variables that can be written as @xmath19 , where the coefficients satisfy @xmath20 if two indexes @xmath21 and @xmath22 are equal and the sets @xmath23 are pairwise disjoint .",
    "for such a step function @xmath15 we define @xmath24 where we put @xmath25 .",
    "it can be seen that the application @xmath26 constructed above from @xmath27 to @xmath28 is an isometry on @xmath27 in the sense @xmath29 = n!\\langle f , g\\rangle_{l^{2}(t^{n})}\\q\\mbox { if } m = n   \\label{isom}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 = 0\\q\\mbox { if } m\\not = n.\\ ] ] since the set @xmath30 is dense in @xmath31 for every @xmath14 the mapping @xmath26 can be extended to an isometry from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and the above properties hold true for this extension .",
    "+ it also holds that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the symmetrization of @xmath15 defined by @xmath35 @xmath36 running over all permutations of @xmath37 .",
    "we will need the general formula for calculating products of wiener chaos integrals of any orders @xmath38 for any symmetric integrands @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which is @xmath41 where the contraction @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 and by extension @xmath44 .",
    "note that the contraction @xmath45 is an element of @xmath46 but it is not necessarily symmetric .",
    "we will denote its symmetrization by @xmath47 .",
    "+      recall that a fbm @xmath48 with hurst parameter @xmath49 and parameter @xmath50 is a centered gaussian process with covariance function @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "it is the only normalized gaussian @xmath0-self - similar process with stationary increments .",
    "the fbm admits the following moving average representation : for every @xmath53 and for every @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a standard brownian motion with time interval @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a strictly positive constant that ensures that @xmath59 for every @xmath53 .",
    "the rosenblatt process is related to the fractional brownian motion .",
    "it shares many properties of the fbm .",
    "for instance , it has the same covariance function ( [ covfbm ] ) as the fbm , it is @xmath0-self - similar and it has stationary increments .",
    "it has the same order of the hlder regularity of its sample paths as the fbm ( that is , the rosenblatt process , as well as the fbm , are hlder continuous of order @xmath60 with @xmath61 ) .",
    "there are also some differences with respect to the fbm .",
    "one of them , is that it is defined only for the self - similarity index @xmath54 and another difference , more important , is that it is not gaussian .",
    "it can be expressed as a double multiple integral with respect to the wiener process and therefore it is an element of the second wiener chaos .",
    "more exactly , a rosenblatt process @xmath62 with self - similarity order @xmath63 and parameter @xmath50 is defined by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a strictly positive constant such that @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath67 we will call a ( standard ) rosenblatt random variable every random variable that has the same law as @xmath68 with parameter @xmath69 . in the sequel we will use the kernel @xmath70 of the rosenblatt process defined by @xmath71    as the second order properties of a rosenblatt process are the same than the ones of the corresponding fbm ,",
    "the process @xmath72 of the increments of a rosenblatt process , defined by @xmath73 with @xmath74 by definition , is a long memory stationary process with covariogram @xmath75 and a spectral density @xmath76 defined for @xmath77 $ ] by : @xmath78 since @xmath79 ( see sinai , 1976 , or fox and taqqu , 1986 ) .      our purpose is to study the asymptotic properties of the whittle estimator of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath80 computed from a sample @xmath81 of a rosenblatt process @xmath62 .",
    "let us briefly introduce the whittle estimator .",
    "the first step is to define the periodogram of the process @xmath82 of the increments of @xmath83 : @xmath84 now , let @xmath85 be a @xmath86-periodic function such that @xmath87)$ ] and define @xmath88 with @xmath76 denotes the spectral density of @xmath82 defined in ( [ covfy ] ) . from ( [ covy ] ) and ( [ perio ] ) , we also have @xmath89 which is a biased estimate of @xmath90 ( see the next section ) .",
    "thus , the periodogram @xmath91 could be a natural estimator of the spectral density ; unfortunately it is not a consistent estimator .",
    "however , once integrated with respect to some @xmath92 function , its behavior becomes quite smoother and can allow an estimation of the spectral density .",
    "the whittle s contrast is a special case of the integrated periodogram @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , this contrast can be written ( see @xcite ) @xmath94 the whittle estimator is thus : @xmath95 but using a classical renormalization ( see fox and taqqu , 1986 for instance ) , the spectral density @xmath76 of @xmath82 can be decomposed as : @xmath96 for all @xmath97 $ ] with @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "+ then @xmath99 for @xmath100 and the minimization of @xmath101 can be write again as a minimization in @xmath102 and this implies that @xmath103    however , for practical use , these definitions @xmath104 and @xmath105 have to be modified .",
    "indeed , the assumption that the process has zero mean is unrealistic .",
    "moreover , the integrals defining the estimators has to be replaced by their approximations by a riemann sum .",
    "thus , define : @xmath106~~\\mbox{and}~~\\overline{y}_n=\\frac 1 n \\ , \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1 } y_k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we prove limit theorems for the integrated periodogram @xmath107 for @xmath108)$ ] satisfying certain conditions . applied to @xmath109 , we will prove the almost - sure convergence of @xmath110 .",
    "applied to @xmath111 and then with a classical taylor expansion also using the case @xmath112 this will provide a non - central limit theorem satisfied by @xmath110 . +   + therefore , the main point is to obtain limit theorems for @xmath107 . for this , we use a ( now ) standard approach based on the chaotic decomposition of the random variable @xmath113 into a sum of multiple stochastic integrals .",
    "since the rosenblatt process at fixed time is a multiple integral of order @xmath114 , the product @xmath115 is a product of two double multiple integrals which can be expressed as a the sum of a multiple integral of order @xmath116 , a multiple integral of order @xmath114 and a deterministic function , which is the expectation of @xmath115 .",
    "this decomposition is transferred to the integrated periodogram @xmath113 , which will be written as sum of two multiple integrals ( one of order 2 , one of order 4 ) plus its expectation .",
    "what we do next , is to analyze these three terms that compose @xmath113 .",
    "we will see that , as in the case of the variation statistic of the rosenblatt process ( see @xcite ) or of wavelet statistic ( see @xcite ) , the dominant term is the one in the second wiener chaos , which will give the asymptotic behavior of @xmath113 .",
    "a detailed study of this term shows that it converges to a rosenblatt random variable .",
