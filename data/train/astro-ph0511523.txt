    "binary radio pulsars in compact short - period orbits around other neutron stars or white dwarfs are valuable to study for a variety of reasons .",
    "the ability to monitor precisely the pulsars as clocks in such systems allows exquisite tests of einstein s theory of general relativity to be performed ( e.g.  taylor & weisberg 1989 ; lyne et al .",
    "additionally , studies of the variations in pulse profile morphology and polarimetry provide probes of relativistic spin - orbit coupling in several systems ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",

    "since many of these binaries will coalesce due to gravitational wave emission well within a hubble time , their merger rate @xcite is of great interest to the gravitational wave detector community as potential sources for current interferometers such as ligo @xcite .    following the discovery of the original binary pulsar b1913 + 16 @xcite , observational progress in finding further relativistic binaries was hampered by a lack of detector sensitivity and computational resources required to detect their strongly time - varying signals @xcite . in recent years , as both of these obstacles are gradually being overcome",
    ", the sample of relativistic binaries with orbital periods less than a day has grown and now numbers eight @xcite . here",
    "we report the discovery of the latest addition to this growing population , psr  j1906 + 0746 , found in the preliminary stages of a large - scale search for pulsars we are carrying out using the 305-m arecibo telescope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this new binary system promises to have a significant impact on all of the science areas mentioned above . in  [ sec : discovery ] we detail the discovery and follow - up observations carried out so far .",
    "we then discuss the implications of these results on the nature of the companion (  [ sec : nature ] ) and merger rate of compact binary systems (  [ sec : age ] ) , and present evidence for pulse profile evolution (  [ sec : profevol ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : future ] , we summarize the main conclusions and look ahead to future work .",
    "psr  j1906 + 0746 , was discovered in precursor observations with the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) system described in paper i. in brief , alfa collects radio signals from the gregorian focus at arecibo using seven cooled receivers which cover different parts of the sky in the 1.21.5  ghz band .",
    "pulsar survey observations with the alfa system ( p - alfa ) were carried out in a precursor phase between 2004 august and 2004 october and covered a total of 15.8  deg@xmath6 in the inner galaxy ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) with 135-s pointings and 14.8  deg@xmath6 in the anti - center region ( @xmath9 , @xmath8 ) with 67-s pointings .",
    "the incoming signals were amplified , filtered and down - converted before being sampled by four wideband arecibo pulsar processors ( wapps ; * ? ? ? * ) . in the configuration used for this survey ,",
    "the wapps provided a spectral resolution of 390.625  khz for both polarizations over a 100-mhz band centered at 1.42 ghz .",
    "the polarization pairs were summed and written to disk every 64  @xmath10s .",
    "initial data reduction was carried out at reduced spectral frequency and time resolution as described in paper i. psr  j1906 + 0746 , was discovered with a signal - to - noise ratio s / n  @xmath11 in data taken on 2004 september 27 .",
    "the pulsar was 2@xmath125 ( 1.47 beam radii ) from the center of the beam ( see paper i ) , where the antenna gain is @xmath135 times smaller than at its center .    with galactic coordinates",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 , psr  j1906 + 0746 lies in the region of sky covered by the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pmps ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "examination of the search output of the 35-minute pmps observation of this position taken on 1998 august 3 showed a 144-ms periodicity with s / n  @xmath16 .",
    "although this was below the nominal s / n threshold of 89 of the pmps , the data were also processed using techniques designed to retain sensitivity to binary pulsars . using the `` stack - and - slide '' algorithm @xcite implemented in the pmps @xcite psr  j1906 + 0746 appears with s / n  @xmath17 .",
    "the pulsar was 38 ( only 0.5 beam radii ) from the center of the beam .",
    "however , due to significant amounts of radio - frequency interference close to 144  ms , psr  j1906 + 0746 was not selected as a candidate in the pmps .",
    "the high degree of acceleration detected in the pmps observation immediately implied that psr  j1906 + 0746 is a short - period binary system . to establish the orbital parameters ,",
    "follow - up observations were initiated in 2005 may using the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank . the data acquisition system used for these 1396-mhz observations was identical to that described by @xcite .",
    "a preliminary orbital ephemeris was obtained from period determinations in 5-min integrations over an initial 9-hr observation .",
    "the ephemeris was then refined in a timing analysis using the tempo software package , where pulse times of arrival ( toas ) were fitted to a model including spin parameters , orbital elements and pulsar position .",
    "the resulting ephemeris , based on 1640 toas spanning 158 days , is given in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "as a check on the solution , the pulsar position was independently derived from a grid of arecibo observations at 3  ghz .",
    "the position thus measured has an uncertainty of 9 arcseconds and is 6.7 arcseconds away from the timing position .",
    "although all data used for the timing solution were collected in the 12  ghz and 34  ghz bands with arecibo , we have also been able to detect psr  j1906 + 0746 at 430  mhz and 6  ghz with arecibo and at 820  mhz with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "the arecibo data were collected using the wapps with 25  mhz bandwidth at 430  mhz and 400  mhz at the higher frequencies .",
    "the gbt data at 820  mhz were obtained using the berkeley ",
    "caltech pulsar machine @xcite in the 48-mhz bandwidth mode described by @xcite . with the exception of 430  mhz ,",
    "the integrated pulse profiles ( figure  [ fig : mfprofs ] ) show that the emission is characterized by a narrow main pulse and significant interpulse feature .",
    "the exponential tails present at 430  mhz are most likely due to interstellar scattering .",
    "flux density estimates based on the off - pulse noise and the radiometer equation ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at each of these frequencies are listed in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "also listed is the spectral index , @xmath18 , obtained from a fit to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the flux density at an observing frequency @xmath21 .    to measure the polarization properties of psr  j1906 + 0746 , a 2.5-hr parkes observation at 1.4  ghz using a wideband correlator was carried out on 2005 may 25 which provided all four stokes parameters across a 256-mhz band . both the main pulse and interpulse have high linear polarization ( about 65% and 50% respectively ) with position angle swings of about @xmath22 across both pulses , increasing for the main pulse and decreasing for the interpulse .",
    "the observed frequency dependence of position angle across the band implies a rotation measure ( rm ) of @xmath23 rad  m@xmath24 , consistent in sign with the faraday rotation seen toward most other pulsars and extragalactic sources along nearby sightlines @xcite .",
    "from the orbital parameters of psr  j1906 + 0746 , we infer a keplerian mass function @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the pulsar mass , @xmath27 is the companion mass and @xmath28 is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky .",
    "our measurement of the orbital periastron advance @xmath29  yr@xmath2 , is , after the double pulsar system @xcite , the second largest observed so far . interpreting this large value within the framework of general relativity",
    "implies that the total system mass @xmath30 . using this , and the constraints from the mass function",
    ", we infer the limits @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "measured masses of the neutron stars in double neutron star binary systems range from 1.25  m@xmath33 ( for psr  j0737@xmath343039b , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to 1.44  m@xmath33 ( for psr  b1913 + 16 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is likely that the mass of psr  j1906 + 0746 is within these limits .",
    "if so , then @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "these inclinations place the size of any shapiro delay well below the current level of timing precision .",
    "although it is possible , in principle , to account for the observed @xmath37 by classical effects ( e.g.  by a tidally induced quadrupole moment from a main sequence star companion , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as discussed by @xcite these are unlikely for this particular orbital configuration .",
    "the simplest interpretation is the relativistic case and the above mass constraints suggest that the companion to psr  j1906 + 0746 is either a massive white dwarf or another neutron star . for the case of a white dwarf companion , the implication @xcite would be that psr  j1906 + 0746 formed from a binary system of near unity mass ratio in which both stars were below the critical core - collapse supernova mass limit @xmath38 . following a phase in which the accretion of matter from the evolved and more massive primary star onto the initially less massive secondary pushed its mass above @xmath39 , the secondary underwent a supernova explosion to form the currently observable pulsar .",
    "two probable endpoints of this scenario are the binary pulsars b2303 + 46 @xcite and j11416545 @xcite .",
    "the alternative case of a neutron star companion is particularly attractive following the recent discovery of the double pulsar system j07373039 @xcite . given the small inferred characteristic age and large magnetic field of psr  j1906 + 0746 , it could be the young second - born neutron star . in this case , as for psr  j07373039a in the double pulsar system , we would expect the companion to be a longer - lived recycled pulsar , spun up to a period of a few tens of ms during an earlier phase of accretion .    to help establish the nature of the companion to psr  j1906 + 0746 , we have carried out a search for radio pulsations in all data collected so far .",
    "following @xcite , we have removed the deleterious effects of the orbital motion on these observations by transforming the time series ( dedispersed to the dm given in table  1 ) to the rest frame of the companion . to account for the unknown orbital inclination , and hence mass ratio , of psr  j1906 + 0746",
    "this process was carried out for 110 different assumed companion masses uniformly sampled in the range @xmath40 .",
    "the corrected time series were then searched for periodic signals by the same fourier transform analysis used in the original survey .",
    "no convincing pulsar candidates were seen down to s / n limits of 6 .",
    "the most sensitive observation we have made so far is a 2.2-hr arecibo observation using 4 wapps to span a 400-mhz band centered at 1.4  ghz . assuming a period of 15  ms and a 10% duty cycle for the putative pulsar , we estimate a limiting flux density of 5@xmath10jy . at the nominal distance of 5.4  kpc ,",
    "the corresponding 1.4-ghz luminosity limit is 0.1  mjy  kpc@xmath6 ; only 0.5% of all currently known pulsars @xcite have a luminosity below this value .",
    "in parallel to these deep periodicity searches , we have also carried out a search for single pulses in the dedispersed time series .",
    "no significant events were found down to flux density limits of 130  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "these deep searches suggest that the companion to psr  j1906 + 0746 is either : ( a ) a white dwarf ; ( b ) a faint radio pulsar with a luminosity below 0.1  mjy  kpc@xmath6 ; or ( c ) a pulsar whose radio beam does not intersect our line of sight . option ( a ) will be hard to test conclusively . a 100  kyr white dwarf at a distance of 5.5  kpc will be of 24th magnitude .",
    "however , given the time necessary for the mass transfer phase in the aforementioned evolutionary scenario , a more probable age for the white dwarf might be @xmath41  myr .",
    "for this larger age , the expected visual magnitude is 29 . even with the very best optical observations it may therefore not be possible to rule out this hypothesis .",
    "given the sensitivity reached by our deep arecibo observations , option ( b ) is unlikely to be testable in the near future .",
    "however , due to the high expected geodetic precession rate ( see below ) it remains a possibility that the radio beam of the putative companion pulsar will precess into our line of sight in future .",
    "a further probe of the nature of the companion would be orbital - phase dependent variations in the pulse profile of psr  j1906 + 0746 .",
    "this effect is now well established in the double pulsar binary system as the relativistic wind from psr  j07373039a impinges on the magnetosphere of its less energetic companion j07373039b @xcite .",
    "while the larger orbital separation and higher rate of spin - down in psr  j1906 + 0746 will make any effect far less for psr  j1906 + 0746 , it may be detectable in the future .",
    "there are no significant pulse profile variations with orbital phase in our current data .",
    "psr  j1906 + 0746 has the smallest characteristic age ( @xmath42  kyr ) of any binary pulsar currently known .",
    "it is also worth noting that , as seen for other young pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a significant amount of polarization is observed . as supernova remnant associations are known for isolated pulsars with similar spin characteristics as psr  j1906 + 0746 ( e.g.  psr  b0656 + 14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have searched the available literature for signs of diffuse radio emission .",
    "no candidates are present in the most recent compilation of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "similarly , no extended radio emission is present at or near the pulsar position in a 332-mhz vla observation of this region @xcite .",
    "the corresponding 1-@xmath43 surface brightness upper limit of @xmath44  w  m@xmath24  hz@xmath2  sr@xmath2 which is fainter than almost all known supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "regardless of the exact nature of the companion to psr  j1906 + 0746 , the small @xmath45 for this pulsar is unusual when placed in context of the radio lifetimes of 10100  myr estimated for normal pulsars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unless @xmath45 is a significant underestimate of the true age of this pulsar , the implication is that we have found a pulsar which is only 0.11% through its active radio lifetime .",
    "since this is highly unlikely to occur by chance , the youth of psr  j1906 + 0746 suggests a potentially significant birth rate for this new class of objects .",
    "a simple estimate of the birth rate can be made by considering the cumulative distribution of characteristic ages .",
    "figure  [ fig : cage ] shows this distribution for a sub - sample of 150 pulsars detected in the pmps which have inferred magnetic field strengths within 1  db of psr  j1906 + 0746 ( i.e.  @xmath46 ) .",
    "this sample shows a linear trend at small ages with a slope of 45  myr@xmath2 .",
    "the relative dearth of pulsars with larger ages reflects the difficulty of detecting them ( e.g.  due to luminosity decay , period - dependent beaming effects , or motion away from the galactic disk ) .",
    "nevertheless , the slope of the trend does provide a good estimate of the formation rate of normal pulsars detectable by the pmps with similar magnetic fields to psr  j1906 + 0746 . since the pmps has only detected one j1906 + 0746-like pulsar in this sample , the inferred birthrate of _ similar pulsars potentially observable in the pmps _ is @xmath47  myr@xmath2 .",
    "to scale this rate over the whole galaxy , we used a monte carlo simulation to estimate the total galactic volume probed by the pmps for j1906 + 0746-like objects .",
    "the simulation seeded a model galaxy with pulsars following the distribution and luminosity functions derived by @xcite .",
    "we find that the pmps should detect roughly one j1906 + 0746-like pulsar for every 40 in the galaxy . with this scaling , we estimate the birth rate of psr  j1906 + 0746-like objects to be @xmath48  myr@xmath2 , where @xmath49 is the unknown fraction of @xmath50  sr covered by the radio beam . for a steady - state population of compact binaries",
    "similar to psr  j1906 + 0746 , we can reasonably assume that the merging rate is equal to the birth rate .",
    "our first - order estimate therefore implies a merger rate of j1906 + 0746-like binaries similar to that derived recently by @xcite for double neutron star binaries .",
    "once the nature of the companion is established , the inclusion of psr  j1906 + 0746 in future population synthesis calculations will provide an important additional constraint on the merger rate of compact binaries ( kim et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of 0.085 for psr  j1906 + 0746 is remarkably similar to that of psr  j0737@xmath343039 @xcite , but smaller than observed for other double neutron star systems .",
    "as proposed recently by @xcite , for psr  j0737@xmath343039 this is likely a selection effect : systems with similar orbital periods but significantly higher eccentricities would coalesce on much shorter timescales than the likely age of psr  j0737@xmath343039 ( @xmath51  yr ) .",
    "as a result , more eccentric binaries are much less likely to be observed . for systems as young as psr  j1906 + 0746 , where there has been less time for significant gravitational wave decay , systems with higher eccentricities could in principle be observed . until further examples of young compact binary pulsars are discovered , it is difficult to conclude whether the low eccentricity is a necessary feature of these systems .",
    "if it is , we will have better constraints on the sequence of events that leads to the formation of pulsars , including supernova kicks ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "if it is not , then there is the exciting possibility of finding other young pulsars in even more compact and eccentric orbits .",
    "it is now established for pulsars observed in four other relativistic binaries ( psr  b1913 + 16 : weisberg et al .",
    "1989 ; kramer 1998 : weisberg & taylor 2002 ; psr  b1534 + 12 : stairs et al .  2004",

    "2005 ) that the mean pulse profile varies with time . with the possible exception of psr  j07373039b @xcite ,",
    "the simplest explanation for this effect is geodetic precession  a general relativistic effect in which the pulsar spin axis precesses about the total system angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the profile variations occur as the precessing pulsar beam changes its orientation with respect to our line of sight .",
    "given the highly relativistic nature of psr  j1906 + 0746 , we also expect to observe this effect in this system .",
    "using the above mass constraints , and the standard geodetic precession formulae @xcite , for psr  j1906 + 0746 we find the expected precession rate is 2.2  yr@xmath2 for the double neutron star case , or 1.6  yr@xmath2 for the neutron star  white dwarf case .",
    "these correspond respectively to precession periods of 164 and 225 yr .",
    "the change in the angle between the line - of - sight and the spin axis is likely to be significantly smaller than the precession rates imply themselves ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pmps detection of psr  j1906 + 0746 provides a 7-yr baseline to look for pulse - shape changes in this new system .",
    "figure  [ fig : profs ] shows a comparison between the integrated profiles at 1400  mhz from the 1998 pmps detection and a recent parkes observation at the same frequency using the same observing system .",
    "we have scaled each profile to the area of the main pulse and formed the `` difference profile '' by subtracting the 2005 profile from the 1998 one . in the absence of any profile evolution",
    ", the difference profile should be free from systematic trends and have a standard deviation consistent with the quadratic sum of the off - pulse noise present in the two input profiles .",
    "we observe a significant departure from random noise around the interpulse region which is not detectable in the 1998 observation .",
    "it is also notable that the peak s / n ( which we define as the peak of the main pulse divided by the off - pulse standard deviation ) seen in 2005 is 80% larger than observed in 1998 . accounting for variations in telescope gain for the two observations , and the fact that the 1998 observation was offset from the nominal position by 3.8 arcmin , we expect a s / n increase of only 30% .",
    "as scintillation is not expected at this frequency for this dm , these observations suggest that the flux density of psr  j1906 + 0746 has increased since 1998",
    ". further observations with better s / n , flux calibration and polarimetric capability are required to confirm and quantify these changes .",
    "we have presented the discovery and initial follow - up observations of psr  j1906 + 0746 , a young 144-ms pulsar in a highly relativistic 3.98-hr orbit about a @xmath52 companion .",
    "the new system emphasizes the relative immunity of surveys with short integration times to the smearing of pulsar signals caused by fast orbital motion .",
    "it also shows the value of storing archival search data for retrospective analysis .",
    "the orbital characteristics and total mass of the binary system , @xmath53 , inferred from the measured periastron advance @xmath54  yr@xmath2 , suggest that the companion is either another neutron star or a massive white dwarf . in the former case , the 112-kyr characteristic age of psr  j1906 + 0746",
    "would imply that its companion is a short - period recycled neutron star .",
    "however , despite intensive searches , we have been so far unable to detect radio pulsations from the companion .",
    "optical searches for a white - dwarf companion could possibly clarify the situation . regardless of the nature of the companion , the apparent youth of psr  j1906 + 0746 implies a birth rate of @xmath5  myr@xmath2 for similar objects in the galaxy . note",
    "that this estimate assumes a beaming fraction for these objects of 20% .",
    "future radio timing and polarimetric observations of psr  j1906 + 0746 should allow the study of several relativistic effects .",
    "the very narrow pulse shape observed ( figure  [ fig : mfprofs ] ) means that our current arecibo toas have an uncertainty of @xmath55s in a 5-min integration .",
    "simulations based on this level of precision show that we expect to measure the gravitational redshift and time dilation parameter , @xmath56 , within the coming year and , within a few years , measure the rate of orbital decay , @xmath57 .",
    "such measurements would determine the orbital inclination and masses of the stars so that the system could possibly be used for further tests of general relativity .",
    "assuming reasonable ranges for the pulsar mass , the orbital inclination angle is likely to be in the range @xmath58 .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of psr  j1906 + 0746 , a young 144-ms pulsar in a highly relativistic 3.98-hr orbit with an eccentricity of 0.085 and expected gravitational wave coalescence time of @xmath0  myr . </S>",
    "<S> the new pulsar was found during precursor survey observations with the arecibo 1.4-ghz feed array system and retrospectively detected in the parkes multibeam plane pulsar survey data . from radio follow - up observations with arecibo , jodrell bank , green bank , and parkes , </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the spin - down and binary parameters of the pulsar and its basic spectral and polarization properties . </S>",
    "<S> we also present evidence for pulse profile evolution , which is likely due to geodetic precession , a relativistic effect caused by the misalignment of the pulsar spin and total angular momentum vectors . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements show that psr  j1906 + 0746 is a young object with a characteristic age of 112  kyr . from the measured rate of orbital periastron advance </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath1  yr@xmath2 ) , we infer a total system mass of @xmath3  @xmath4 . while these parameters suggest that the psr  j1906 + 0746 binary system might be a younger version of the double pulsar system , intensive searches for radio pulses from the companion have so far been unsuccessful . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not known whether the companion is another neutron star or a massive white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the nature of the companion , a simple calculation suggests that the galactic birth rate of binaries similar to psr  j1906 + 0746 is @xmath5  myr@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that psr  j1906 + 0746 will make a significant contribution to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems . </S>"
