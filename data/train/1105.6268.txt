    "this parameterization leaves the form of the hamiltonian @xmath5 unchanged as @xmath3 varies .    in many circumstances , the following criterion adequately estimates the magnitude of the total error @xmath0 at time @xmath6 for a given hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the instantaneous energy of the @xmath10 eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath5 and @xmath11 is the energy of the eigenstate being transferred ( usually the ground state )  @xcite .",
    "we use the convention @xmath12 .",
    "although eq .   provides an expedient heuristic for estimating the accuracy of adiabatic passage , it is ( in general ) neither necessary nor sufficient to bound the fidelity of adiabatic state transfer @xcite .",
    "this equivocality opens the possibility of a modest allocation of resources being used to enable significantly improved error - scaling .",
    "one method of improving the fidelity of adiabatic transfer is via the use of a `` local adiabatic '' evolution  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the local adiabatic approximation is to tailor variation of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath14 to minimize the instantaneous nonadiabatic transition rate @xmath15 .",
    "local adiabatic methods have lead to substantial improvements in the asymptotic error - scaling @xmath0 with respect to the hilbert space dimension @xmath16  @xcite ; however , they do not improve the scaling of the error with @xmath3 .",
    "recently , methods were developed for improving the scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath3 from order @xmath17 to @xmath18 by setting the first @xmath19 derivatives of the hamiltonian to zero at the beginning and end of the evolution  @xcite .",
    "error reduction techniques employing this result are collectively referred to as `` boundary cancellation methods . ''",
    "boundary cancellation methods have two main drawbacks : first , they assume that the first @xmath19 derivatives of @xmath5 are exactly zero , leaving it unclear whether they are robust against small variations in the derivatives of the hamiltonian ; second , in the regime of short @xmath3 these methods can have error - scaling that is inferior to the trivial case wherein no boundary cancellation technique is applied ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",
    "our work addresses these problems : we first provide an analysis of the sensitivity of boundary cancellation methods to small variations in the values of the first @xmath19 derivatives of @xmath5 ; we then show that phase interference can be used to further reduce errors without increasing @xmath19 , providing better error - scaling for short @xmath3 .",
    "we present a new technique for quadratically suppressing the probability of a particular nonadiabatic transition during adiabatic passage .",
    "it works by exploiting a phase interference effect that appears in adiabatic systems with hamiltonians obeying a simple symmetry .",
    "this effect can be exploited in a realistic class of time - dependent hamiltonians that includes many adiabatic algorithms and transport protocols , as well as any hamiltonian obeying @xmath21 .",

    "any time - dependent hamiltonian may be adapted to satisfy eq .",
    ", simply by adjusting its rate of change in @xmath14 at the boundaries .",
    "if eq .   is not exactly satisfied then the phase interference effect will still reduce errors , but it will not necessarily improve the asymptotic error - scaling with @xmath3 .",
    "our method can be used in conjunction with existing boundary cancellation methods to produce even greater improvements in the asymptotic error - scaling with @xmath3 .",

    "we refer to boundary cancellation methods that are augmented by our scheme to produce order @xmath32 error - scaling as `` augmentented boundary cancellation methods . '' in section  [ sec : error1 ] , we will analyze the error robustness of our augmented boundary cancellation method along with the original schemes laid out in refs .",
    "we show that performance improvements are derived from accurate knowledge of the system s eigenspectrum @xmath37 , its total evolution time , and the derivatives of its hamiltonian , and we provide quantitative error - bounds on these quantities .",
    "we provide numerical examples that verify the predictions of our theory in sections  [ sec : search ] and  [ sec : gate ] .",
    "we will break our discussion of the theory of our method into two parts .",
    "first , we discuss the special case for which @xmath20 .",
    "this simple case is conceptually distinct from existing boundary cancellation techniques , which require @xmath38 to produce improvements over eq .  .",
    "we then discuss the more general case in which @xmath39 .",
    "to obtain our results , it is _ not _ necessary to assume that the instantaneous eigenvalues satisfy the ordering condition @xmath40 .",
    "we do however require that @xmath41 , unless transitions between @xmath42 and @xmath22 are strictly forbidden by @xmath5 . for convenience",
    ", we also assume that the phases of the instantaneous eigenvectors are chosen such that @xmath43 .",
    "this choice does not affect the quantum dynamics , but it simplifies the analysis of the error .",
    "we also assume that the hamiltonian is differentiable @xmath44 times and that each derivative is bounded for all @xmath3 .",
    "these last restrictions are put in place order to prevent issues that arise for hamiltonians resembling that of the marzlin  sanders counterexample  @xcite .    given the above assumptions , the error in the adiabatic approximation @xmath0 for a hamiltonian evolution acting on an @xmath16-dimensional hilbert space is given by @xmath45 we know from previous work that @xmath46  @xcite , and asymptotically tight expressions are known for @xmath47 in the @xmath20 case  @xcite .",
    "we therefore begin with this case to illustrate how our phase interference effect can be utilized . given that @xmath20 , the form of @xmath47 reduces to @xmath48 and where @xmath49 .",
    "if we choose @xmath5 to obey  , then the absolute value of eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath50    eq",
    ".   has extrema at @xmath33 .",
    "it is maximized when @xmath34 is odd and vanishes when @xmath34 is even .",
    "thus , when @xmath33 ( even @xmath34 ) , phase interference causes the magnitude of the @xmath10 component of @xmath0 to be quadratically reduced from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .    if @xmath39 then the phase interference effect also suppresses probability of excitation to @xmath53 at @xmath33 for any even integer @xmath54 , but this effect does not directly follow from existing results .",
    "we show in appendix  [ appendix:1 ] using a perturbative expansion ( similar in reasoning to that of refs .",
    "@xcite ) that if the first @xmath19 derivatives of @xmath55 are zero at the boundaries @xmath56 then @xmath57 implying that adiabatic phase interference effects reduce the order of transition amplitude @xmath47 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 when @xmath33 for even @xmath34 .",
    "limits on the precision of physical apparatus prevent perfect phase cancellation in realistic applications .",
    "errors can result from imperfect modelling of the hamiltonian , inexact calculations of the gap integrals , or inaccuracies in the timing or control apparatus .",
    "it is therefore necessary to address the impact of empirical imperfections on the feasibility of augmented boundary cancellation methods and determine when they methods can be experimentally realized .",
    "`` symmetry errors '' occur when the timing symmetry condition   is not precisely satisfied : @xmath58 comparing eq .   with eq .  , we find that the contributions to @xmath47 due symmetry errors are of order @xmath32 so long as @xmath59 .",
    "`` gap errors '' occur when inaccuracies in the estimate of the gap integral leave condition unsatisfied : @xmath60 expanding eq .   in powers of @xmath61",
    ", we find that the contributions to @xmath47 due to gap errors are of order @xmath32 if @xmath62 .",
    "`` timing errors '' occur when the actual evolution time @xmath3 differs from the ideal evolution time @xmath63 : @xmath64 expanding eq .   in powers of @xmath65 , we find that the contributions to @xmath47 due to timing errors are of order @xmath32 if @xmath66 .",
    "`` derivative errors '' can also occur wherein one or more of the derivatives of the hamiltonian that is assumed to be zero is not : @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "such errors do not affect the error - scaling if for all such @xmath69 , @xmath70    in other words , given that the first @xmath19 derivatives of @xmath13 are _ approximately _ zero at the boundaries , the uncertainty in each derivative must shrink polynomially as @xmath3 increases in order to achieve the full promise of an augmented boundary cancellation method . the proof that this criteria is sufficient is not simple : it requires a high - order perturbative analysis of the error in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "details are provided in appendix  [ appendix:2 ] .",
    "if @xmath19 is a constant , then it follows that augmented boundary cancellation methods are error robust in the sense that their error tolerances scale polynomially with @xmath71 .",
    "this is not problematic for numerical studies because additional precision can be provided at poly - logarithmic cost .",
    "however , experimental errors can not always be so conveniently reduced , and boundary cancellation techniques that use a large value of @xmath19 may be impractical .",
    "the situation is even worse if exponential error - scaling is required , which can be obtained if @xmath72 . in such circumstances the tolerances @xmath73 decrease exponentially with @xmath3 and therefore boundary cancellation methods are not error robust .",
    "this implies that boundary cancellation techniques ( augmented or not ) can not in practice achieve exponential scaling without exceedingly precise knowledge of the derivatives of the hamiltonian at the boundaries",
    ". the @xmath20 method may therefore be more experimentally relevant than its higher - order brethren , because of its minimal precision requirements and its superior scaling for modestly short @xmath3 .",
    "as the performance improvements provided by boundary cancellation methods come at the price of increasingly accurate information about the hamiltonian and the evolution time , such information may be viewed as a computational resource for protocols utilizing quantum adiabatic passage .",
    "this suggests that current analyses @xcite of the resources required for generic adiabatic quantum computing may be incomplete .",
    "we illustrate this subtlety in section  [ sec : search ] by showing how to quadratically improve the total error - scaling @xmath74 of an already `` optimal '' quantum algorithm .",
    "adiabatic quantum computing ( aqc ) algorithms are natural candidates for error suppression by our technique . to demonstrate , we examine an algorithm that adiabatically transforms an initial guessed state into the sought state of a search problem  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for this algorithm is    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the state that the algorithm seeks , and @xmath78\\mapsto[0,1]$ ] obeys @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "specifically , we claimed that our augmented boundary cancellation methods reduce @xmath87 from order @xmath31 to @xmath32 . we will now justify why this is the case .    using the path - integral representation of the time - evolution operator presented in  @xcite we have that    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is defined for any @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the set @xmath134 by @xmath135 we analyze the series under the assumption that the first @xmath19 derivatives of the hamiltonian are zero at the boundaries @xmath28 . using integration by parts , we find that @xmath136 then , using the fact that @xmath137 , the first term on the right side of eq",

    "this is because these terms involve contain multiple products of @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , if we perform integration by parts @xmath139 times on the outermost integral , then the term involving @xmath143 becomes multiplied by at least one @xmath142 term , which is zero on the boundary by definition . therefore , no non - zero terms appear in the expansion of these integrals to @xmath141 .",

    "[ sec : theory ] combines with existing methods .",
    "in section  [ sec : error1 ] we claimed without proof that if the uncertainty in the @xmath144 derivative of @xmath5 is @xmath145 for all @xmath68 , then that derivative can safely be assumed to be negligible .",
    "we prove this now by demonstrating that the leading order terms involving @xmath146 or @xmath147 for @xmath68 are of order  @xmath32 under this assumption .",
    "we begin by assuming that , for some @xmath148 , @xmath149 is non - zero at the boundaries @xmath28 and that all lower derivatives are negligible there . following the argument put forward in appendix  [ appendix:1 ] , the lowest order term that appears after applying integration by parts @xmath148 times to eq .",

    "therefore do not affect the error - scaling .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to render errors in the @xmath154 derivative of @xmath5 negligible by taking them to be @xmath153 .    by the same reasoning ,",
    "if the uncertainty in the @xmath144 derivative of @xmath5 is @xmath145 for all @xmath68 , then the total contribution of derivative errors is @xmath32 given that @xmath155 .",
    "this implies that augmented boundary cancellation methods are robust to derivative errors given that @xmath19 is a fixed integer .",
    "this result also trivially implies that existing boundary cancellation methods are robust to derivative errors under the same circumstances",
    ".    if @xmath19 is not bounded from above by a constant then this analysis fails because the previous analysis ignored multiplicative factors of @xmath19 that appear in the analysis .",
    "such terms could make the neglected higher - order derivative terms much larger if @xmath19 is an increasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "this means that if we wish to achieve exponential error - scaling by taking @xmath156 , then the tolerance for derivative errors must shrink even further from the already exponentially small error tolerances obtained by substituting @xmath156 into @xmath145 for fixed @xmath69 .",

    "<S> we present a new technique that improves the scaling of the error in the adiabatic approximation with respect to the evolution duration , thereby permitting faster transfer at a fixed error tolerance . </S>",
    "<S> our method is conceptually different from previously proposed techniques : it exploits a commonly overlooked phase interference effect that occurs predictably at specific evolution times , suppressing transitions away from the adiabatically transferred eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> our method can be used in concert with existing adiabatic optimization techniques , such as local adiabatic evolutions or boundary cancellation methods . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a full error analysis of our phase interference method along with existing boundary cancellation techniques and show a tradeoff between error - scaling and experimental precision . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these findings using two examples , showing improved error - scaling for an adiabatic search algorithm and a tunable two - qubit quantum logic gate .    </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic approximation underpins many important present - day and future applications , such as stimulated rapid adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , coherent control of chemical reactions @xcite , and quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation asserts that a system will remain in an instantaneous eigenstate of a time - varying hamiltonian if the time - variation happens slowly enough . </S>",
    "<S> errors in this approximation correspond to transitions away from the instantaneous ( `` adiabatically transferred '' ) eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> for high - performance applications , it is not always practical to minimize errors by slowing things down . </S>",
    "<S> ambitious future technologies , such as quantum computing devices , will demand simultaneous maximization of both accuracy and speed .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a phase cancellation effect that appears during an adiabatic evolution and can be exploited to polynomially reduce the probability of a given transition at fixed maximum evolution time . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to speed increases at fixed error probability . </S>",
    "<S> unlike alternative methods that obtain improvements by modifying the adiabatic path  @xcite , our technique chooses the evolution time so that destructive interference suppresses the transition . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this phase cancellation effect can be exploited to improve existing adiabatic error reduction strategies such as local adiabatic evolutions or boundary cancellation methods . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an error analysis of our method and conclude that the accuracy improvements come at the price of increasingly precise knowledge of the time - dependent hamiltonian ; this implies that accuracy is an important and quantifiable resource for quantum protocols utilizing adiabatic passage . </S>"
