    "ever since gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were first reported as flashes of cosmic gamma rays lasting for less than a tenth of a second to more than tens of seconds @xcite , they have shown a great diversity .",
    "unfortunately , their energy source and radiation mechanism remain highly speculative ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the first detection of x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite afterglows that faded as a single power law @xmath0 , strongly favored the prior relativistic fireball models @xcite .",
    "even though the origin of prompt gamma - rays remained uncertain , the longer - wavelength afterglows , especially the optical afterglows , have been found broadly consistent with fireball models ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the fundamental understanding of grb afterglows has been questioned by the _ swift _",
    "mission @xcite , which has revealed several unexpected behaviors in the x - ray afterglows ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "some bursts have an initial steep decline , followed by a shallow decline a few hundred seconds later ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "others have erratic flares with strong spectral variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a group , they were proposed to have some canonical behaviors @xcite .",
    "contradictorily , some other bursts also show evidences for a single power - law decline @xcite , which are consistent with the pre-_swift _ observations @xcite .    with the x - ray afterglows being puzzlingly diverse",
    ", it is a great challenge to produce an applicable and self - consistent physical understanding ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "previous works on grb diversity were based on relatively restricted samples , e.g. , 27 bursts in @xcite , with only 10 measured redshifts ; 33 bursts in @xcite , with only 9 measured redshifts ; and 19 bursts in @xcite , with only 12 measured redshifts . with more than 500 _ swift _ grbs detected up to now , we realize that it is urgent to revisit the diversity issue with an extended sample .    using a collection of 150",
    "_ swift _ grbs with well detected x - ray afterglows and known redshifts , we find that there exist some underlying global features in the rest - frame x - ray light curves , which might clarify the diversity issue and provide some strong constraints on the theoretical models .",
    "the structure of this letter is as follows : the sample and data analysis are presented in section  [ sec : sample ] , the rest frame light curves are interpreted in section  [ sec : ugf ] , and the discussions and conclusion are given in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "_ swift _ is a multiwavelength observatory @xcite , which carries three instruments : burst alert telescope ( bat ) , x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , and ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) .",
    "we made extensive use of the automated bat - xrt products provided by the uk _ swift _ science data centre @xcite , the online bat grb event data processing report provided by taka sakamoto and scott d. barthelmy , and the online big table of all well - localized grbs provided by jochen greinerjcg / grbgen.html , which is mainly our source for measured redshifts . ] .    in table",
    "[ tab : sample ] , we list the 150 bursts from grb 050126 to grb 100425a with measured redshifts .",
    "we find the mean redshift @xmath1 2.14 ( with the median @xmath2 ) , which is significantly smaller than the previously evaluated ( e.g. , @xmath1 2.8 for 16 bursts by @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions of the bat duration @xmath3 both in the observer and rest frame are shown in figure [ fig : t90 ] .",
    "the mean value of @xmath3 in observer s frame is 80.4 s , consistent with that deduced in a sample of 237 bursts by @xcite . with the 150 measured redshifts in our sample , we find that the mean value of @xmath3 in the rest frame is 29.2 s. shorter bursts increase significantly in number , but no positive classification can be made .",
    "even so , as indicated in figure [ fig : t90 ] , there is an apparent oddball , grb050509b , which has an extremely short duration @xmath4 s in the rest frame .    to view the overall behaviors of grbs in their rest frame , we take advantage of the _ swift _ burst analyser , which provides the combined bat - xrt light curves in the form of flux density @xmath5 at 10 kev in the observer s rest frame @xcite . with the measured redshift @xmath6 , the isotropic spectral luminosity at a given photon frequency @xmath7 ( which is 10 kev in this work ) in the rest frame can be calculated by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the emitted photon energy in the rest frame for the observed photon energy @xmath7 and @xmath10 is the time measured in the rest frame related to the time @xmath11 measured in the observer s frame . here , a single power - law spectrum has been assumed @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time - dependent photon index , which is available by the _",
    "swift _ burst analyser @xcite . throughout this work , the luminosity distance @xmath14",
    "is calculated by assuming the cosmological parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . according to the error propagation rule",
    ", the uncertainty in the isotropic spectral luminosity can be given by @xmath18 ^ 2\\left[\\sigma_{f_\\nu}^2+f_\\nu^2\\ln^2(1+z)\\sigma_\\gamma^2\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the uncertainties in the measured flux density and photon index , respectively , and the uncertainty in grb redshift measurements is considered negligible .",
    "in figure [ fig : restframelc ] , the calculated x - ray light curves from 0.01 s to @xmath21 s after bat trigger at 10 kev in the rest frame with the spectral evolution of 150 _ swift _ grbs are plotted together .",
    "interestingly , some underlying global features are revealed in both the light curves and spectral evolution , despite the fact that some bursts may have some non - trivial behaviors .",
    "the bulk of the light curves build up a plateau lasting for about tens of seconds with significantly spectral softening and a following power - law decline with almost invariant spectra until the detection limit is reached .",
    "this feature , for instance , is well exhibited by the remarkable naked - eye burst grb080319b @xcite .",
    "there are also several apparent outliers , e.g. , grb060218 , grb100316d , and grb060614 .",
    "the former two showed clear evidences of an associated supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while on the contrary the latter showed unexpected evidences of no associated supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another two peculiar ones are the extremely short burst grb050509b and the optically dark burst grb090417b .",
    "the former had an overall much lower luminosity , and the latter showed evidences of dust extinction and scattering , revealed by the strong spectral softening @xcite , as predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "interestingly , those outliers tend to have a lower redshift .    to explore the underlying global features mentioned above",
    ", we fit a broken power - law model to the light curves with the 145 grbs ( i.e. , without the apparent outliers , grb050509b , grb060218 , grb060614 , grb090417b , and grb100316d ) , assuming a four - parameter function @xmath22 where ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) is the transition position between the two power laws with the indices as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the best - fitting results ( top panel in figure [ fig : restframelc2 ] , dashed line ) are @xmath27 s , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the goodness of fit is measured by the adjusted coefficient of determination , @xmath31 , which is very close to 1.0 and indicates a good fit .",
    "separately , we fit the spectral evolution with another four - parameter function @xmath32 where ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) is the transition position between two linear segments in the log - linear plot , with the slopes as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the best fitting results ( bottom panel in figure [ fig : restframelc2 ] , dashed line ) are @xmath37 s , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .    at this point ,",
    "based on the light curves and spectral evolution history , two emission ingredients can be distinguished in the x - ray emission : an early plateau with significant spectral softening and a following power - law decline without spectral variance . given that @xmath42 , this strongly suggests that the former is connected with the prompt emission and the latter is connected with the afterglow emission . since these two components have been thought to arise from different radiation regions in the relativistic ejecta , the seemingly nice transition in the light curves may raise a fine - tuning issue .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancy between @xmath23 and @xmath33 implies that the interpretation is more complex .    to further explore the details at the junction , we now introduce two additional breaks both in the light curve and in the spectral evolution .",
    "therefore , we have an eight - parameter model for the light curve defined by @xmath43 where , ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) and ( @xmath46,@xmath47 ) are the positions of the first and third break points , respectively , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the sequential four power - law indices .",
    "given these eight free parameters , the position of the second break point is fixed according to equation ( [ eq : lcfit2 ] ) and can be determined by @xmath50^{1\\over { \\alpha_3-\\alpha_2}}. \\label{eq : lcl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the best - fitting results ( top panel in figure [ fig : restframelc2 ] , thick line ) are @xmath51 s , @xmath52 , @xmath53 s , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "given the best - fitting parameters , we have @xmath60 s , and @xmath61 according to equations ( [ eq : lct2 ] ) and ( [ eq : lcl2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we have another eight - parameter model for the spectral evolution defined by @xmath62 where ( @xmath44,@xmath63 ) and ( @xmath46,@xmath64 ) are the first and third break points , respectively , between linear segments in the log - linear plot , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the sequential four slopes .",
    "given these eight free parameters , the position of the second break point is also fixed according to equation ( [ eq : phontofit2 ] ) and can be determined by @xmath67 the best - fitting results ( bottom panel in figure [ fig : restframelc2 ] , thick line ) are @xmath68 s , @xmath69 , @xmath70 s , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "given the best - fitting parameters , we have @xmath77 s and @xmath78 according to equations ( [ eq : spet2 ] ) and ( [ eq : spegamma2 ] ) .",
    "the goodness of fit has been improved for both the light curve and the spectral evolution , though the spectral evolution still appears to be a little more deviant than is presumed by the fitting model .",
    "the general agreement of the three break times of the light curve and those of the spectral evolution , in spite of the fact that the two fittings are made separately , justifies the existence of the extra breaks we have just assumed .",
    "therefore , the four - segment fitting model ( with eight free parameters ) is a more realistic interpretation for the underlying global feature , which , hereby , is composed of an early plateau ( @xmath79 ) with a mild softening ( @xmath80 on average ) , a following steep decline ( @xmath81 ) with a further severe softening ( @xmath82 on average ) , a newly emerging shallow decline ( @xmath83 ) with a slight spectral hardening ( @xmath84 on average ) , and a following single power - law decline ( @xmath85 ) without spectral variation ( @xmath86 ) until the detection limit is reached .",
    "however , as indicated by figure [ fig : restframelc2 ] , the four - segment model is not overwhelmingly better than the two - segment model , since the steep decline and the shallow decline of most bursts are interlacing with each other and can not be well defined in both the light curves and spectral evolution . for some bursts ( e.g. , grb080319b ) ,",
    "the existence of the shallow decline and the steep decline is debatable .",
    "grbs have been exposed to be diverse both in their observed prompt emission and afterglow emission . as a result",
    ", the physical interpretation has remained controversial . in this work , based on the x - ray data @xcite of 150 well - monitored _ swift _ grbs with measured redshifts , we find , in the rest frame , some underlying global features concealed in the observed complex x - ray light curves and the spectral evolution , which could clarify the diversity issue .    generally speaking , two distinct and consequent emission ingredients unequivocally exist in the x - ray light curves as explicitly revealed by the spectral differences shown in figure [ fig : restframelc2 ] , which can be simply recognized as the prompt emission with apparent spectral softening and the afterglow emission without apparent spectral evolution , respectively .",
    "the most straightforward global features are the early plateau ( @xmath87 with @xmath88 on average ) with a mild spectral softening ( with a photon index increase @xmath89 on average ) and the late single power - law decline ( @xmath90 with @xmath91 on average ) without spectral variation ( with a constant photon index @xmath86 on average ) up to @xmath92 s , which are the previously known prompt emission and afterglow emission , respectively .",
    "the transition from the prompt emission to the afterglow emission undergoes two distinct phases : a steep decline ( @xmath93 with @xmath94 on average ) with a severe spectral softening ( @xmath95 on average ) and a shallow decline ( @xmath96 with @xmath97 on average ) with a mild spectral hardening to agree with the invariant spectra in the afterglow emission .",
    "the temporal feature is consistent with the canonical behavior previously proposed @xcite .",
    "the spectral feature supports the speculation that the steep decline is connected with the prompt emission , while the shallow decline is more relevant to the afterglow emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the erratic x - ray flares reportedly existing in half of the bursts are not self - explanatory in our analysis .",
    "since they exhibit significant spectral softening and their peak luminosity follows a steep power - law decline @xmath98 statistically @xcite , they should be connected with the steep declines , which also explains their analogy to the prompt emission .    furthermore , as proposed earlier the spectral feature could be a crucial signature for discriminating the prompt emission from the afterglow emission . for this reason , the high - energy emission detected by the _",
    "satellite which normally decays as a single power law with an index @xmath99 and shows no significant spectral evolution could be more convincingly interpreted as the emission of the external forward shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , despite being composed of complex spikes , the superposition of the prompt x - ray light curves of different bursts exhibits an _",
    "unexpected _ plateau lasting about @xmath100 s on average .",
    "this might signal a rather steady central engines .",
    "furthermore , it indicates that the variabilities displayed by the complex spikes may just manifest the internal instabilities in the relativistic outflows launched by the central engines . for the family of black - hole central engines",
    ", this may shed some lights on the process of accreting onto a nascent black hole .",
    "we assume that the accretion process does not significantly alter the mass of the black hole ( @xmath101 ) and the accretion timescale is that of the free fall @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the newton s constant and @xmath104 is the initial distance of the accreting matter to the central engine",
    ". then we simply estimate the accretion rate as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the number density of the star material being accreted .",
    "the `` steady '' prompt emission may suggest that @xmath107 , which could in turn imply that @xmath108 . such a density profile should hold up to a radius @xmath109 , beyond which the density profile should be steepened to @xmath110 to account for the steep decline @xmath81 , supposing the luminosity of the x - ray emission is still proportional to , where @xmath11 is the ejection time of the last main pulse in which high latitude emission dominates over that of all other pulses . for the global feature of the steep decline found in figure [ fig : restframelc2 ] this model works for @xmath111 . ]",
    "the steep decline continues up to @xmath113 s corresponding to @xmath114 cm . on the other hand , for a magnetar - like central engine",
    ", the plateau phase can be naturally accounted for if the prompt emission is powered by the dipole radiation of the magnetar @xmath115 for @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the so - called spin - down timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quick decline phase could indicate that either the magnetar has collapsed due to significant accretion or the efficiency of converting the wind energy of the spin - down ( @xmath118 ) magnetar decreases with time .",
    "last but not least , we need to mention that the seemingly continuous evolution with a single power law from the prompt to the afterglow phase of most grbs , which was first hinted by the _ bepposax _",
    "satellite @xcite , might provide some strong constraints on the theoretical models .",
    "otherwise , a severe fine - tuning would be needed .",
    "meanwhile , the well - known canonical behavior seems to be overemphasized .",
    "the presence of a steep decline followed by a shallow decline ( @xmath119 with @xmath120 ) in the early x - ray light curves might not be as prevailing as previously thought .",
    "even though , a statistical bias may exist with respect to the bursts with a well - determined redshift , which should be brighter and less affected by dust extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the bursts in our sample that exhibit a single power - law decline tend to have a relatively larger luminosity .",
    "while the bursts that have puzzlingly different features , especially those that clearly exhibit a steep decline followed by a shallow decay , tend to have a much lower luminosity during the shallow decline , which may give some hint on the origin of the shallow declines and disfavor the energy injection models .",
