    "the axino , stable or almost stable on cosmological time scales , is a well - motivated dark matter ( dm ) candidate .",
    "axinos differ from ordinary weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in that they are exceedingly weakly interacting ( ewimps ) , which radically changes their cosmological properties and also ways of testing them in experiment .",
    "relic axinos can be produced in a hot plasma or in decays of heavy particles in the early universe .",
    "the most interesting case is when it can be cold dark matter ( cdm ) - the possibility that was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where axinos were generated in the decays of heavier particle after freezeout in the process that was dubbed _",
    "non - thermal production _ ( ntp ) .",
    "this was next extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to include thermal production ( tp ) through scatterings and decays of particles in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it was also pointed out there that the axino could as well be hot dm ( hdm ) or warm dm ( wdm ) , or that , for instance , one of its populations could be warm while the other cold . since then the axino as dm in cosmology , astrophysics and collider experiments has been studied in many papers  @xcite .",
    "the axino as the superpartner of the axion was first considered right after it was recognized that softly broken supersymmetry ( susy ) was relevant for particle physics  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an experimental confirmation of axino existence would validate two theoretical hypotheses designed to solve two respective hierarchy problems : the strong cp problem by a very light axion  @xcite and the gauge hierarchy problem by susy  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the axion , axino interactions with standard model ( sm ) and minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) particles are suppressed by the axion decay constant @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantity that is most relevant for the axino in astro - particle physics , and at the same time most poorly known , is its mass @xmath1 .",
    "several theoretical calculations of the axino mass followed  @xcite .",
    "a method for calculating axino mass applies to any goldstino ( the superpartner of a goldstone boson ) .",
    "a goldstino related to the goldstone boson has a root in a global u(1 ) symmetry and receives its mass below the susy breaking scale .",
    "susy breaking triggers the super - higgs mechanism and is related to the gravitino mass @xmath2 which has recently been clarified in  @xcite . even though generically axino mass is of order",
    "@xmath2 , a theoretically allowed mass range encompasses all the range relevant for hot , warm and cold dm axinos .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail below .    in the early days ,",
    "a very light hdm - like axino from the decay of a photino was considered  @xcite to constrain the photino mass dependence on the axion decay constant @xmath0 .",
    "rajagopal , turner and wilczek  @xcite considered axinos in a kev mass range .",
    "axinos in this mass range can give a right amount of dm if produced in the thermal equilibrium and constitute wdm in the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "however , this kind of thermal axino is not useful if the reheating temperature @xmath3 after inflation is much lower than the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry breaking scale @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the population of primordial axinos is strongly diluted by cosmic inflation and axinos are subsequently re - generated after reheating .",
    "due to the exceedingly small interaction strength , @xmath4 , the relic abundance of thermal axinos depends on the reheating temperature and on the axion model .",
    "this special feature allows us to have a glimpse on the earliest time after inflation , through the reheating temperature inferred from the relic density of axino dm .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , due to the strongly suppressed interaction strength , it is not necessary to assume @xmath5 parity for axinos to constitute dm .    in this paper , we provide a review of the axino as dm and its implication in cosmology , astro - particle physics and collider phenomenology .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : defa ] , we introduce axino frameworks and present an effective lagrangian describing its interactions . in sect .",
    "[ sec : axinocosmology ] , we discuss in more detail the production of axinos , as well as cosmological applications for the hdm , wdm , cdm , and superheavy axino cases . in sect .  [",
    "sec : axinocolliders ] , we review cdm axino production at colliders and its links with the early universe . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize the discussion of axino dm and its cosmological consequences .",
    "the strong @xmath6 problem can most naturally be solved by introducing a very light axion field @xmath7  @xcite which couples to the gluon anomaly @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath10 is the dual of the field strength @xmath11 for eight gluons @xmath12 .",
    "this interaction term can be obtained after integrating out colored heavy fields below the pq symmetry breaking scale @xmath0 but above the electroweak scale @xmath13 . the axion decay constant @xmath0 is constrained from astrophysical and cosmological considerations to a narrow window @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the upper bound is obtained here assuming that the initial misalignment angle is of order one , and can be lifted if the angle were assumed smaller than one  @xcite .",
    "a general low energy axion interaction lagrangian can be written in terms of the effective couplings with the sm fields @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which arise after integrating out all heavy pq - charge carrying fields .",
    "the resulting effective axion interaction lagrangian terms are  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath17 can be set to one by rescaling @xmath0 .",
    "the axion decay constant @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is defined up to the domain wall number , @xmath21 . the derivative interaction term proportional to @xmath22 preserves the pq symmetry .",
    "the @xmath23-term is related to the phase of the quark mass matrix , and the @xmath17-term represents the anomalous coupling .",
    "the axion - lepton interaction term @xmath24 is analogous to the axion - quark interaction term .",
    "two prototype field theory models for _ very light _",
    "axions have been considered in the literature . at the sm level ,",
    "one considers the six sm quarks , @xmath25 , as strongly interacting matter fermions . above the electroweak scale @xmath26",
    "one additionally introduces beyond the sm ( bsm ) heavy vector - like quarks ( @xmath27 ) , which in the interaction lagrangian  ( [ eq : efflagr ] ) are next integrated out .    at the field theory level",
    "the axion is present if there exist quarks carrying the net pq charge @xmath28 of the global u(1)@xmath29 symmetry . in the kim - shifman - vainstein - zakharov  ( ksvz ) model  @xcite",
    "one introduces only heavy quarks as pq charge carrying quarks .",
    "this results in @xmath30 , and @xmath31 below the @xmath13 , or below the qcd scale @xmath32 .",
    "the gluon anomaly term ( the @xmath17 term ) , induced by an effective heavy quark loop , then solves the strong @xmath6 problem .",
    "the axion field is a component of the sm singlet scalar field @xmath33 . in the dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitskii ( dfsz ) model  @xcite instead one does not assume any net pq charge in the bsm sector , and instead the sm quarks are assigned the net pq charge , _ i.e. _  , @xmath34 and @xmath35 below the electroweak scale @xmath13 . here also , the axion is predominantly a part of the sm singlet scalar field @xmath33 .",
    "several specific implementations of the ksvz and dfsz frameworks can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite which , however , require a whole host of additional bsm fields",
    ". therefore , any references to the properties of the ksvz and the dfsz models can serve at best as just guidelines . in this respect",
    ", it is unfortunate that there exists only one reference clarifying the axion - photon - photon coupling from a string - derived bsm framework  @xcite .",
    "susy models of very light axion can provide a clue about the magnitude on the axion decay constant @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was speculated that it is related to the mssm higgs / higgsino mass parameter @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "recently , a permutation symmetry @xmath38 has been used to relate @xmath0 and @xmath36 , realizing the old hypothesis in terms of a discrete symmetry  @xcite .",
    "using a discrete symmetry toward an approximate global symmetry is theoretically welcome in that it evades the wormhole breaking of the pq symmetry  @xcite .",
    "before one considers spontaneous symmetry breaking of u(1)@xmath29 , the axion lagrangian can be said to have the axion shift symmetry ( which is just a phase rotation ) , @xmath39 , and the physical observables are invariant under the pq phase rotation .",
    "below @xmath0 , the pq rotational symmetry is broken , which is explicitly reflected as a breaking of the axion shift symmetry through the appearance of the @xmath23 and @xmath17 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efflagr ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath23 term enters into the phase and a discrete shift of the axion field can bring it back to the original value .",
    "the @xmath17 term is the qcd vacuum angle term and if the vacuum angle is shifted by @xmath40 then it comes back to the original value .",
    "thus , even though the u(1)@xmath29 is broken , one of its discrete subgroups , _",
    "i.e. _  , the one corresponding to the common intersection of the subgroups corresponding to the @xmath23 and @xmath17 terms , can never be broken . as a result ,",
    "the combination @xmath41 is invariant under the axion shift symmetry , and @xmath41 is defined to be an integer signifying the unbroken discrete subgroup of u(1)@xmath42  @xcite .",

    "this suppression is manifest in the dfsz axion model or in the ksvz model if the heavy quark mass is relatively low compared to the pq scale in which case the heavy quark is of course not integrated out .",
    "however , susy must be broken at low energy and thus a susy relation between the axino and the axion is modified .",
    "in fact , the most important axino parameter in cosmological considerations , the axino mass @xmath1 , does not even appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : laxino ] ) .",
    "susy breaking generates the masses for the axino and the saxion and modifies their definitions .",
    "the saxion mass is set by the susy soft breaking mass scale , @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "the axino mass , on the other hand , is strongly model dependent . an explicit axino mass model with susy breaking",

    "the case @xmath76 was also considered in  @xcite but this model gives @xmath77 .",
    "as first pointed out by tamvakis and wyler  @xcite , the axino mass is expected to receive at least a contribution at the order of @xmath78 at tree level in the spontaneously broken global susy . in the literature ,",
    "a whole range of the axino mass was considered ; and in fact it can be even much smaller  @xcite , or much larger , than the @xmath71  @xcite . because of this strong model dependence , in cosmological studies one usually assumes the axino interactions from the u(1)@xmath29 symmetry and treats axino mass as a free parameter .",
    "recently , the issue of a proper definition of the axion and the axino was studied in the most general framework , including non - minimal k@xmath79hler potential  @xcite . in that study ,",
    "axino mass is given by @xmath80 for @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath84 , axino mass depends on the details of the k@xmath79hler potential , and it was shown that the case given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : susyglobbr ] ) belongs to one of these examples . in gauge mediation scenario ,",
    "the gaugino mass is the dominant axino mass parameter . in the case of gravity mediation ,",
    "the axino mass is likely to be greater than the gravitino mass but one can not rule out lighter axinos  @xcite .",
    "one lucid but often overlooked aspect of the axino is that its definition must be given at a mass eigenstate level .",
    "the coupling to the qcd sector given in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : laxino ] ) can plausibly be that of the axino but it does not give the axino mass .",
    "this is because the axino is connected to two kinds of symmetry breaking , the pq global symmetry breaking and the susy breaking , which in general are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "the pq symmetry breaking produces an almost massless pseudo - goldstone boson ( the axion ) , while susy breaking produces a massless goldstino .",
    "the massless goldstino is then absorbed into the gravitino to make it heavy via the super - higgs mechanism .",
    "this raises the question of what the axino really is .",
    "this issue is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : axinodef ] taken from ref .",
    "the axino must be orthogonal to the massless goldstino component .",
    "therefore , for the axino to be present in a spontaneously broken supergravity theory , one has to introduce at least two chiral fields  @xcite . even though its name refers to the axion - related qcd anomaly",
    ", one must select the component which is orthogonal to the goldstino .",
    "if there are two sm singlet chiral fields , this is easy since there is only one component left beyond the goldstino .",
    "however , if more than two chiral fields are involved in susy breaking , more care is needed to identify the orthogonal mass eigenstate . among the remaining mass eigenstates beyond the goldstino ,",
    "a plausible choice for the axino field is the component whose coupling to the qcd anomaly term is the biggest . for two initial chiral fields in fig .  [",
    "fig : axinodef ] , @xmath85 has the anomaly coupling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : laxino ] ) and hence the @xmath44 coupling to the qcd sector is equal to or smaller than those given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : laxino ] ) .",
    "the remaining coupling is the one to the @xmath86 components of a massive gravitino .",
    "therefore , for the two initial chiral fields , axino cosmology must include the gravitino , as well , if @xmath85 is not identical to @xmath44 .",
    "the `` leakage '' is parametrized by the @xmath87-term of the initial axion multiplet @xmath46 . with more than two initial chiral fields ,",
    "the situation involves more mass parameters . one notable corollary of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the axino cdm relic abundance for @xmath88 is an over - estimation if @xmath46 obtains the @xmath87-term .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "the exceedingly weak strength of axino interactions makes axino detection in direct dm search experiments as well as at collider experiments rather hopeless .",
    "however , at the lhc a signal of axino dm in @xmath5-parity conserving scenarios may show up in the properties of the losp .    with axino dm",
    ", the losp typically decays with the lifetime of less than one second . therefore , even if it is unstable on cosmological time scales , it is practically stable inside a collider detector , although it will decay outside it .",
    "one spectacular signature of non - standard dm would be to detect an electrically charged ( stau ) or colored ( stop ) massive particle as a losp that would be seemingly stable in a detector .    however , this would still leave the question open whether the lsp is the axino or for example the gravitino .",
    "measuring the losp lifetime would not be sufficient .",
    "if the losp is an electrically charged particle , such as stau , then this could be possible with the analysis of three - body decay of the charged nlsp slepton into the corresponding lepton , the lsp and a photon .",
    "one way would be to measure the spin of the lsp through the polarization of the final - state lepton and photon  @xcite .",
    "another is to measure the branching ratio and the angular distributions of the decay products in the three - body decays of the losp  @xcite .",
    "even if a stable massive neutral particle , such as the neutralino , is detected at the lhc through a missing energy signature , this will still not guarantee its dm nature conclusively since it could decay outside of detectors . a signal indicating",
    "the same mass would therefore be necessary in direct and indirect dm searches .",
    "the absence of one could indicate the existence of lighter stable particle , such as the axino or the gravitino , playing the role of dm . in this way , with the axino as dm , a large region of the ( c)mssm which would be forbidden with neutralino dm becomes allowed  @xcite .    with much luck , one could in principle measure at the lhc",
    "enough quantities to estimate , at least roughly , the relic abundance of the losp and compare it with the cosmological value .",
    "if the two were radically different , again this would indicate a non - standard choice for dm .",
    "a model - independent study of axino dm from collider information was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on the thermal and non - thermal production of axinos and the cold dm density , @xmath89 and from the information inferred on the relic density of losp at colliders",
    ", one could attempt to determine a relation between the reheating temperature and the mass of axino .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_ma ] ( taken from ref .",
    "axino is an intriguing candidate for dm in susy with the axion solution of the strong @xmath6 problem .",
    "the mass and interactions are highly dependent on the axion model and its coupling to sm particles are suppressed by the pq scale @xmath0 .",
    "however , susy breaking alters the connection so that the axino becomes massive and can also have mixing with the goldstino  @xcite .",
    "axinos can be produced in the thermal plasma in the early universe in scatterings and decays of heavier particles and in out - of - equilibrium decays of heavier particles .",
    "axino relic density can be obtained to coincide with the correct density of dm .",
    "axinos can be hdm , wdm or cdm depending on their mass range and production mechanism",
    ". there could also be two populations of axinos , for example one warm and one cold , from different production modes . in the case of heavy axinos",
    ", neutralinos can be produced from decays of axinos and extend the available parameter space and help to explain the positron anomaly in pamela and ams-02 .",
    "the identification of losp and its interactions at colliders might provide a relationship between the reheating temperature and the axino mass , and also glimpses into the earliest moments of the universe after inflation if the dm is made up of thermally produced axinos .",
