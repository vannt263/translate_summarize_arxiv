    "our exploration of the evolution of the cosmic metal enrichment relies mainly on two methods .",
    "one is based on the detection of absorption lines in the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies crossing qso sight - lines ( prochaska et al .",
    "2003 ) , and gives information of one line of sight in the galaxy .",
    "the other uses emission lines of the warm ism ( hii regions ) detected in the integrated galaxy spectra , and is observationally much more challenging at high redshift because important lines get very weak and redshifted to the near ir .",
    "the warm ism metallicity and the mass of galaxies are strongly correlated in the low-@xmath11 universe ( lequeux et al .",
    "more massive galaxies have higher metallicity than less massive galaxies . this mass - metallicity ( m - z ) relation has never been detected at high redshift .",
    "in fact , measurements of the stellar mass ( strongly correlated with the dynamical mass ; brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) require deep optical / nir photometry of faint targets , and are not easy to obtain for a sufficiently large sample for which metallicity is known .    to explore any evolution with redshift , luminosity , as a proxy for mass , can be used instead , although luminosity is more difficult to interpret physically than mass .",
    "the metallicity of large @xmath12 galaxy samples has been studied in relation to the galaxy luminosity by kobulnicky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , lilly , carollo , & stockton ( 2003 ) , kobulnicky & kewley ( 2004 ) and liang et al .",
    "kobulnicky & kewley ( 2004 ; hereafter kk04 ) have used about 200 galaxies from the team keck redshift survey ( tkrs ; wirth et al .",
    "2004 ) and found a luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) relation displaced towards higher luminosities with respect to the same relation detected at @xmath13 ( kennicutt 1992 ; jansen et al .",
    "this suggests a redshift evolution of the l - z relation . at higher",
    "@xmath11 , only a handful of galaxies have been studied so far ( pettini et al .",
    "2001 ; shapley et al . 2004 ) and again low metallicities are found compared to galaxies with similar luminosity at low redshifts .",
    "do we also expect the m - z relation to evolve with time ?",
    "shifts of the l - z relation will arise from simple luminosity evolution ( i.e. changing the mass  to - light ratio ) and this is well documented in galaxies over @xmath14 ( schade et al .",
    "1996 ; vogt et al .",
    "in particular passive fading of stellar populations ( as observed in early - type galaxies , e.g. aragon - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ) would shift l - z but not m - z .",
    "however , astrophysically , we would expect the star - formation activity over @xmath14 to manifest itself in changes of metallicity as well as mass .",
    "the question is what is the form of this change and can it be detected ?    from a different prospective ,",
    "the cold ism , damped lyman-@xmath6 ( dla ) galaxies detected in qso spectra have metallicities @xmath15 solar at @xmath3 ( prochaska et al .",
    "2003 ) , i.e.  one order of magnitudes lower than line emitters at similar redshifts ( kk04 ) .",
    "part of the discrepancy could be due to the fact that the absorption lines statistically probe the outskirt of galaxies , where metallicity is lower , while emission line flux originates in the central more metal rich region ( chen , kennicutt , & rauch 2005 ; ellison et al . 2005 ; schulte - ladbeck et al .  2005 ) .",
    "another possibility is that dlas and line emitters are probing different galaxies all together .",
    "unfortunately , so far no information on masses of dla galaxies is available .    in this work",
    "we present the first attempt to derive the mass - metallicity relation in high redshift galaxies selected by near - ir photometry down to small masses .",
    "the sample is selected from the @xmath16 galaxies of the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ; abraham et al .",
    "2004 ) and canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; crampton et al.1995 ; le fvre et al .",
    "1995 ; lilly et al .",
    "masses were estimated using deep optical - nir photometry and metallicities using optical spectroscopy .",
    "for consistency with gdds , metallicities for the cfrs galaxies were recomputed using emission line fluxes published by lilly et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter lcs ) .",
    "before continuing our discussion it is important to emphasize that measurements of physical parameters can differ by some factor , depending on how they are estimated .",
    "for instance , masses can change by a factor of @xmath17 , depending on which initial mass function ( imf ) is applied .",
    "similarly , metallicities can be different by a factor of @xmath18 , depending on which set of lines and/or calibrator are considered ( kennicutt , bresolin & garnett 2003 ; kk04 ) .",
    "thus , we paid special attention to deriving results , and comparing them with other works , in a consistent fashion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we describe the sample section from the gdds ; in  3 we present the gdds composite spectrum used to derive an overall stellar absorption and dust extinction ;  4 &  5 describe the stellar mass and the metallicity derivations , respectively , for the gdds and the cfrs samples ;  6 &  7 are about the luminosity - metallicity and mass - metallicity relations , respectively ; in  8 we discuss possible systematic effects ;  9 is on the modeling of the redshift evolution of the m - z relation ; the discussion and the concluding remarks are in  10 and  11 . throughout the paper",

    "one of the puzzling results of the m - z relation obtained for the star - forming galaxies by t04 and here , is that these galaxies appear to be generally metal rich for their stellar mass .",

    "first we have to consider that there are systematic differences between different metallicity calibrators ( see  [ metcal ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the metallicity decreases with the distance from the galaxy center ( garnett et al .",
    "according to rolleston et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , in the milky way the oxygen abundance goes from @xmath163 to 8.6 , at 6 kpc and 12 kpc from the center , respectively , with a radial gradient of @xmath164 dex kpc@xmath49 .",
    "although the quantitative result depends on the empirical method used to measure metallicity , and although some extragalactic studies indicate lower central metallicities ( kennicutt et al .",

    "the fiber aperture for the sdss sample ( @xmath165 ) corresponds to a median diameter of 4.6 kpc ( t04 ) . at a distance of 4.6/2 kpc from the center , according to rolleston et al .",

    "we show that other possible systematic effects are not going to dramatically change our conclusions on the evolution of the m - z relation .      if there is a gradient of the metallicity with the distance from the center ( vila - costas & edmunds 1992 ; zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 ; garnett et al .",
    "1997 ; rolleston et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is important to make sure that this effect is not dominating when comparing samples obtained using different slit apertures .",
    "we considered that the central part of a galaxy is more luminous than the outer part , and at high redshift is going to dominate the signal in the spectra .",
    "kewley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have investigated the aperture effects as a function of redshifts , and found that the metallicity is generally not more than 0.1 dex larger than the average in the @xmath166 kpc central region .",
    "this 4 kpc corresponds to an angular size @xmath167 for galaxies at @xmath168 . for this reason",
    ", the aperture effects are not strongly affecting the @xmath3 results , because the region probed is generally large enough , and because residual offsets are affecting galaxies in a similar way .",
    "the sdss fiber aperture corresponds to a median projected diameter of 4.6 kpc ( circular area is 16.6 kpc@xmath40 ) , with a range extending from 1 to 12 kpc@xmath40 , from the low to the high redshift end . however , t04 estimated a modest ( 0.1 dex ) metallicity change in the same redshift interval .",
    "the gdds extraction aperture rectangle is @xmath169 arcsec@xmath40 and corresponds to @xmath170 kpc@xmath40 and @xmath171 kpc@xmath40 , from @xmath172 to 0.96 .",
    "the median for the sample is @xmath173 kpc@xmath40 .",
    "the dispersion of the physical area in the sdss sample is higher than in gdds , and the median value is lower .",
    "it is hard to estimate precisely the mean difference between the two apertures due to the large aperture dispersion in the sdss , we do not expect the aperture effect to be important .",
    "for the cfrs sample , the slit aperture is twice the gdds aperture in the dispersion direction ( 1.3 arcsec , or 9.3 kpc at @xmath174 ) and 20@xmath175 in the perpendicular direction , so the galaxy area probed is larger than the sdss area .",
    "however , following kewley et al.(2005 ) and considering the small metallcity dispersion observed in the sdss sample , we expect the effect to be small .",
    "another related effect is the galaxy inclination .",
    "t04 estimated 0.2 dex higher metallicity in fully face - on galaxies than in fully edge - on galaxies , for fixed mass . for 15 of our gdds galaxies we obtained hst / acs f814w images ( abraham et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "one - third are face - on , 1/3 are edge - on and 1/3 are intermediate ( figure  [ f6 ] ) .",
    "because this is a random effect , it would make the dispersion in the metallicity larger , but any significant difference between the @xmath4 and the @xmath3 samples would remain basically unchanged .      a very important systematic effect to take into account is linked to the several metallicity calibrators used by different studies .",
    "kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the metallicity based on an electron - temperature sensitive method is on average a factor of 2.5 lower than that derived using the empirical method by kewley & dopita ( 2002 ) .",
    "this factor becomes @xmath17 , when compared with the calibrator used by us ( kk04 ) .",
    "we do not discuss here what the best method is , because this is still controversial and is a strong function of what is observationally available ( e.g. , what set of emission lines are used ) .",
    "however , because of these differences , we have paid particular attention to comparing metallicities after converting to the _ same calibrator _ , namely , the kk04 one .",
    "this is the minimum requirement necessary to make the detection of the redshift evolution of the m - z relation more robust .",
    "another possible bias to consider is the dust extinction . as stated in ",
    "[ dust ] , dust extinction does not have a huge effect on the metallicity .",
    "this decreases by only 0.2 dex if @xmath59 goes from 0 to 3 .",
    "we applied @xmath176 and @xmath78 for gdds and cfrs galaxies , respectively .",
    "the choice of using a lower extinction in the cfrs is justified by the higher luminosity of the cfrs galaxies , not entirely accounted for by the relatively higher stellar masses of the same sample with respect to the gdds sample .",
    "indeed , the cfrs is a @xmath57 selected survey that used the 4 m canada - france - hawaii telescope , thus cfrs very likely could not identify highly extincted galaxies .",
    "the gdds is a @xmath1 selected survey that used a larger telescope , so suffers less from this bias .",
    "brinchman et al .  (",
    "2004 ) found that massive ( @xmath177 m@xmath178 m@xmath179 ) star - forming galaxies on average suffer 3 times ( in magnitudes ) more extinction than low mass galaxies ( @xmath180 m@xmath181 m@xmath8 ) , i.e. , opposite to what we have assumed .",
    "even if there was no bias in the cfrs sample , assuming a larger extinction in the more massive galaxies would have a small effect on the correlation , but the scatter would be larger .",
    "we now attempt to derive an empirical model describing the redshift evolution of the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "this will allow to predict the stellar mass ( or the metallicity ) of a galaxy at a given redshift and metallicity ( or stellar mass ) .",
    "let us arbitrarily assume that at high redshift the shape of the sdss relation is preserved , but it moves towards higher masses .",
    "we prefer to move the sdss relation in the @xmath182 direction instead of the @xmath183 direction , because this can better reproduce @xmath3 gdds and cfrs points in the m - z plane .",
    "the best match is obtained if the m - z relation is moved to the right by @xmath184 ( black solid curve in figure  [ f13 ] ) . at",
    "higher redshift only the few galaxies studied by shapley et al .",

    "of course we have to consider the big uncertainty due to the way metallicities are measured .",
    "however , eq .  [ z ] describes in a simple and powerful fashion the evolution of the metal cosmic abundance in the universe for different mass bins .",

    "is provided by a sfr which stops earlier in more massive galaxies than in low - mass galaxies ( heavens et al .",

    "another way to describe this is a gas fraction ( gas mass over total mass ) available for star formation , that declines more rapidly in more massive galaxies , or a period of star formation that lasts longer in less massive galaxies .",
    "theoretical scenarios explaining these observations , must properly consider gas flows in both directions ( in and out of the galaxy ) .",
    "galactic flows are mainly driven by the formation of massive stars which blow out gas from the galaxy , and by the gravitational potential of the galaxy ( related to its mass ) , which on the one hand confines the gas in the galaxy , and on the other attracts metal - poor gas from the external igm .",
    "the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic times was predicted by pei & fall ( 1995 ) using infall , outflow and closed - box ( no flows ) models .",
    "larson ( 1974 ) described in his early work that low mass galaxies are metal poor due to the gas loss after supernova explosions .",
    "ferrara & tolstoy ( 2000 ) found later on in their models that indeed galaxies with gas mass @xmath193 m@xmath8 lose mass in outflows .",
    "we tried to reproduce the m - z relation evolution using the closed - box approach .",
    "although the large dispersion in the m - z point distribution can indicate that galactic flows play a role in the chemical state of galaxies , the closed - box model allows one to start to understand what basic assumptions are necessary to explain the observations .",
    "we use the pgase modeling ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 , 1999 ) and assume that initially the galaxy is only made of gas with a given total mass @xmath194 and zero metallicity . as the gas collapses and stars form ,",
    "the total mass remains constant , and part of the gas is turned into stars .",
    "both stellar mass and metallicity increase simultaneously as the galaxy evolves .",

    "another galaxy with stellar mass @xmath205 m@xmath8 at @xmath204 , will only have doubled its stellar mass after the same time interval has passed .",

    "all this is generally based on the @xmath33 luminosity , a parameter that poorly constrains the galaxy mass , because the @xmath33 luminosity is easily extincted by dust , and represents short - lived massive stars more than the bulk of the stellar mass .",

    "remarkably , the best fit predicts that the stellar mass of dla galaxies is @xmath208 m@xmath8 , all the way from @xmath209 to 4.1 .",
    "this suggests that typical dlas are not originating in very low - mass dwarf galaxies , but are intermediate mass systems .",
    "the estimated stellar mass would be 2 times higher ( + 0.3 dex ) if the metallicity derived using the @xmath45 parameter is overestimated by a factor of 2 ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ; kk04 ) .",
    "figure  [ f15 ] and eq .  [ z ] also suggests that local dwarf star - forming galaxies , with metallicities of @xmath210 solar ( aloisi et al .  2003 ; and references therein ) , have stellar masses of the order of @xmath211 m@xmath8 . in the distant universe , the star - forming galaxies at @xmath212 of the k20 with stellar masses ( after correcting for bg03 imf ) of @xmath213 m@xmath8 ( fontana et al.2004 ) would have a mean metallicity slightly over solar , in agreement with results derived using uv stellar features by de mello et al.(2004 ) . in a previous gdds work ( savaglio et al .",
    "2004 ) we have studied the ism absorption in a sample of 13 galaxies at mean redshift @xmath214 and found indication of high metal enrichment .",
    "the average stellar mass of this sample is @xmath215 m@xmath8 , which leads again , according to eq .",
    "[ z ] , to metallicity slightly above solar .    for the lbgs studied by pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) at @xmath216 , applying the kk04 calibrator and a modest dust extinction of @xmath78 , the reported emission line fluxes of 4 galaxies give @xmath217 . at the redshift of the galaxies , eq .",
    "[ z ] gives a mean stellar mass of @xmath215 m@xmath8 , i.e.  about a factor of 2 less massive than the mean value in the @xmath5 lbgs of shapley et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "massive lbgs are often used to derive the high-@xmath11 sfr history of the universe ( the madau plot ; madau et al .",
    "the madau plot is then used to derive the cosmic chemical evolution . a discrepancy with the dla metallicity evolution ( which is lower and steeper )",
    "was noticed by madau , pozzetti , & dickinson ( 1998 ) . the discrepancy is likely because the metallicity evolution of different galaxies with substantially different stellar masses are compared .",
    "this is confirmed by by hopkins , rao , & turnshek ( 2005 ) , who found that dlas have a dominant role in the sfr density only in the late universe ( @xmath218 ) , but at higher redshift their contribution is much less important .",
    "we also note that even if the analytic model of the cosmic metallicity evolution by pei et al .",
    "( 1999 ) resembles the dla metallicity evolution , this alone does not necessarily prove that the cosmic chemical evolution is well represented by the dla galaxies .",
    "our empirical model can be tested using recent results on a dla sample at @xmath219 ( ledoux et al .",
    "2005 ) showing a correlation between feii absorption equivalent width ( representing the galaxy dynamical mass ) and metallicity .",
    "metal rich dlas have larger feii ew than metal poor dlas , a result which is reminiscent of the m - z relation .",
    "if properly translated , their correlation at a mean redshift of @xmath220 is consistent with our m - z relation ( c.  ledoux , private communication ) .",
    "the observed evolution of the m - z relation can be reproduced by a closed - box scenario where the e - folding time is shorter for more massive galaxies .",
    "a star formation more concentrated in time in massive galaxies than in less massive galaxies is consistent with the `` downsizing '' scenario of galaxy formation .",
    "other models can not be ruled out by our simple approach .",
    "one shortcoming of our simple model is that it makes no attempt to consider the impact of galaxy - galaxy mergers on the evolution .",
    "this is known to evolve rapidly with redshift ( le fvre et al .",
    "mergers have the most dramatic effect when they are between galaxies of similar mass , and in many such cases the merger product will no longer be star - forming and hence not be included in these samples .",
    "the existence of a tight m - z relation implies that an equal mass merger will shift galaxies to the right in figure  [ f16 ] , the net effect will be to make the model tracks less steep . a model which included merging",
    "would then have to have a different form for @xmath221 in order to compensate for this effect .",
    "a full treatment of merging would require a detailed semi - analytic ( e.g. , springel et al .",
    "2005 ) or hydrodynamical model ( nagamine et al .",
    "2004 ) of galaxy formation which is beyond the scope of this work , though we believe the empirical relations we have discovered will greatly inform such a comparison .",
    "we note that it is much more straight - forward to compare stellar mass with metallicity as galaxies assemble in a model as one has to make less assumptions ( e.g. , about dust ) than one does with a luminosity comparison .",
    "in this paper , we investigated for the first time the high-@xmath11 mass - metallicity relation .",
    "we used galaxies from the gdds and cfrs , for which stellar mass estimates were possible thanks to the available multi - band optical - nir photometry ( crampton et al .",
    "1995 ; le fvre et al .  1995",
    "; lilly et al .",
    "1995 ; mccarthy et al . 2001 ; chen et al.2002 ) .",
    "the metallicity was measured using the @xmath45 and @xmath113 over a sample of star - forming galaxies at @xmath16 . for the cfrs sample , we recalculated values measured by lilly et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using the recent calibrator provided by kobulnicky & kewley ( 2004 ) .",
    "stellar mass and metallicity are measured simultaneously for 56 galaxies .",
    "thanks to the large mass range , @xmath222 m@xmath8 , and the size of the sample , we unambiguously detect a @xmath223 significant correlation between stellar mass and metallicity at @xmath3 ( eq .",
    "[ met2 ] ) .",
    "such a m - z relation is displaced with respect to the m - z relation at @xmath4 , towards higher stellar masses , or lower metallicities .",
    "galaxies at a given metallicity are more massive than galaxies in the local universe with similar metallicity .",
    "we attribute the origin of this to the redshift evolution of the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "although the shape of the m - z relation depends to some extend on the choise of the metallicity calibrator , our result on the evolution of the m - z relation is robust , as all metallicities are estimated using the same calibrator .",
    "the stellar mass is more tightly correlated to metallicity than the luminosity ( the dispersion around the best fit is 1.6 times smaller ) . moreover , the redshift evolution of the m - z relation is more significant than the redshift evolution of the metallicity found in large samples of galaxies with different stellar mass .",
    "we find the m - z evolution to be more rapid in lower - mass galaxies indicating that they are still actively being constructed .",
    "in contrast the more massive galaxies have already reached solar metallicity at @xmath224 indicating that the bulk of their star - formation has completed .",
    "based on the observed results , we derive an empirical model for the evolution of the mass - metallicity relation as a function of redshift which works surprisingly well . from this , one can estimate the expected stellar mass of a galaxy at a given metallicity and redshift .",
    "if our model is correct , we predict that the stellar mass of dlas is @xmath225 m@xmath8 at any redshift .",
    "according to the same model , the few lbgs at @xmath226 studied by pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) may have stellar masses of the order of @xmath227 m@xmath8 .",
    "the predicted masses are @xmath17 times higher if the @xmath121-based metallicity calibrator is used ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "our empirical model is nicely reproduced by a toy scenario of galaxy formation where the important prescription is a star formation that proceeds more rapidly in more massive galaxies , as described by the downsizing scenario for galaxy formation . any more detailed model of galaxy formation must also reproduce the observed m - z relation as a function of redshift .",
    "future programs can test our predictions .",
    "for instance , by measuring metallicities of galaxies with known masses in the @xmath228 universe .",
    "galaxies of the gdds and k20 ( fontana et al .  2004 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ) would be a suitable testbed to this goal . to measure metallicities ,",
    "nir spectroscopy would be required , not an easy , but possible , task for those faint galaxies .",
    "stellar masses of dlas can directly be measured by obtaining @xmath1 band photometry of qso fields .",
    "this can more efficiently be done using the nir capabilities of @xmath229 over low-@xmath11 targets , to limit the confusion with the qso psf .",
    "alternately ground - based adaptive optics may advance to the point where this is possible with larger telescopes .",
    "finally , our proposed model of star formation history of galaxies , which is a function of mass , can be compared with the sfr history of the universe in mass bins ( juneau et al .",

    "<S> we have investigated the mass - metallicity ( m - z ) relation using galaxies at @xmath0 from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) and canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> deep @xmath1 and @xmath2 band photometry allowed us to measure stellar masses for 69 galaxies . from a subsample of 56 galaxies , for which metallicity of the interstellar medium is also measured </S>",
    "<S> , we identified a strong correlation between mass and metallicity , for the first time in the distant universe . </S>",
    "<S> this was possible because of the larger base line spanned by the sample in terms of metallicity ( a factor of 7 ) and mass ( a factor of 400 ) than in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation is much stronger and tighter than the luminosity - metallicity , confirming that stellar mass is a more meaningful physical parameter than luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we find clear evidence for temporal evolution in the m - z relation in the sense that at a given mass , a galaxy at @xmath3 tends to have lower metallicity than a local galaxy of similar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath4 sloan digital sky survey m - z relation , and a small sample of @xmath5 lyman break galaxies with known mass and metallicity , to propose an empirical redshift - dependent m - z relation , according to which the stellar mass and metallicity in small galaxies evolve for a longer time than in massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this relation predicts that the generally metal poor damped lyman-@xmath6 galaxies have stellar masses of the order of @xmath7 m@xmath8 ( with a dispersion of 0.7 dex ) all the way from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed redshift evolution of the m - z relation can be reproduced remarkably well by a simple closed - box model where the key assumption is an e - folding time for star formation which is higher or , in other words , a period of star formation that lasts longer in less massive galaxies than in more massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> such a picture supports the downsizing scenario for galaxy formation . </S>"
