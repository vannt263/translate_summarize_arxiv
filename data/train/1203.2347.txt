    "this simplified picture ( even its beyond - markovian version ",

    "these difficulties have spurred introducing various formalisms to somehow incorporate non - markovian effects into open system s dynamics , e.g. , through adding memory kernels @xcite or even devising specific dynamical equations valid for non - markovian regimes ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "an interesting question in open quantum system theory is that given the interaction hamiltonian of a system and its environment whether the induced dynamics on the system is markovian or not .",
    "several methods have been suggested to assess non - markovianity of a dynamics . here ,",
    "based on the idea that underlying correlations play key role in a reduced dynamics , we employ quantum discord ( qd ) to define a measure for non - markovianity . to alleviate the need for the state of the environment in calculating qd in our scheme , we have considered an experimentally measurable lower bound for qd by using a monogamy property for tripartite quantum systems .",
    "this bound being nonvanishing provides a sufficient condition for non - markovianity of a quantum dynamics .",
    "we also have discussed two examples to illustrate the result of this study . in the first example",
    ", it has been shown that qd can signal non - markovianity in a process which eludes the entanglement measure of non - markovianity .",
    "the second example has featured an explicit quantum dynamics whose non - markovianity is strictly due to the production of quantum correlation not in the form of entanglement . here , the initial state of the system and environment was a product state and remained separable in time , while the state of the environment did not vary in time either .",
    "having powerful non - markovianity measures at hand , one can think of various applications in quantum information theory .",
    "for example , an intriguing question is that how one should engineer an environment so that the generated sub - dynamics of the attached system becomes markovian .",
    "this is important because , for example , it has been argued @xcite that one can perform adiabatic quantum computation in an indirect fashion in an open system , provided that the effective system dynamics is a markovian evolution with fixed points encoding ground states of some given hamiltonian .",
    "such scenarios require ability to decide whether an environment induces markovian sub - dynamics .",
    "our method provides a way to go to answer this question .",
    "given an interaction hamiltonian with unknown coupling constants , @xmath116 , and a preparation of the system and environment ( assuming being feasible ) , @xmath26 , we can find the state of the system and the environment as a function of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and check for which values of @xmath116 , @xmath21-discord remains zero in time . as a result , we are in principle able to manipulate coupling constants such that the desired map becomes markovian or non - markovian on demand .    _",
