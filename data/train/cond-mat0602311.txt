    "recent years have seen an explosion of results and discussions on a particular symmetry in the fluctuations of various dissipation functions .",
    "while started in the context of smooth dynamical systems and of thermostating algorithms and simulations @xcite , soon the symmetry was judged relevant in the construction of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . moreover",
    ", a unifying scheme was developed under which the various fluctuation symmetries were found to be the result of a common feature .",
    "the basic idea is there that a dissipation function for a physical model can be identified with the source of time - symmetry breaking in the statistical distribution of system histories , see e.g. @xcite for more details .",
    "that dissipation function is mostly related to the variable entropy production but , depending on the particular realization , can also refer to heat dissipation or to dissipative work . for a given effective model",
    ", one of course always needs to check again that basic relation between time - reversal and dissipation .",

    "is done on the particle . at the same time , some of it flows as heat @xmath3 to the surrounding medium , checking the conservation of energy @xmath4 for the evolution during a time interval @xmath5 .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fluctuating quantities and they are path - dependent .",
    "our main result concerns a symmetry in the fluctuations of @xmath2 .",
    "we give conditions on the potential and on its time - dependence @xmath1 under which the fluctuation symmetry for @xmath2 is exact , i.e. , that for all times @xmath6 , without further approximation , @xmath7    here , the particle s position is initially distributed with @xmath8 according to thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the notation @xmath10 refers to the dissipated work which equals the work @xmath2 up to a difference in free energies . if the evolution would be reversible , then @xmath11 . in general , and confirming the second law , we have @xmath12 but also takes into account the trajectories where @xmath13 .",
    "the exact fluctuation symmetry tells us that such `` negative dissipative work '' trajectories are exponentially damped .",
    "+ since the heat @xmath3 differs from the dissipated work only by a temporal boundary term @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is non - extensive in time @xmath6 , one could perhaps expect that @xmath3 satisfies the standard fluctuation symmetry , i.e. , that the same as in is true after taking the logarithm and letting @xmath17 : @xmath18 for @xmath19 the heat per unit time .",
    "interestingly , that is not what always happens , see @xcite .",
    "we will explain how the unboundedness of the potential @xmath20 can change the symmetry .",
    "for small enough @xmath19 ( basically , for @xmath21 ) the relation remains intact but for all large enough @xmath19 the lefthand - side of saturates and is constant .",
    "+ in what follows , we discuss the symmetry relations and in mathematical detail .",
    "in particular , we give near to optimal conditions on potential and protocol for which holds .",
    "before , that was shown only for the case of a harmonic potential where the minimum of the potential is moved with a fixed speed via an explicit calculation @xcite .",
    "there it was also found that can be broken and the modification was explicitly calculated . here",

    "we find optimal conditions on potential and protocol under which the dissipated work satisfies an exact fluctuation symmetry , i.e. , one that is valid for all times .",
    "the heat differs from that dissipated work via a temporal boundary term and also satisfies some general fluctuation symmetry asymptotically in time . because the potential is unbounded , that last symmetry is not the same as in the standard steady state fluctuation theorem .",

    "such dynamics have been considered before in a wide variety of contexts but for fluctuation theorems the emphasis has been on the gaussian case .",

    "counter examples ( for which the work does not satisfy an efs ) will show why these conditions are close to optimal .",
    "we end with a discussion on the relevance of temporal boundary terms in the large deviations of the heat .",
    "for the proofs we refer to section [ ssec : proofs ] .",
    "first look at quadratic potentials , e.g. for @xmath54 which coincides with the potential if @xmath55 . for that class of quadratic potentials , as in",

    "+ [ prop : harmonic ] if the distribution of the work @xmath59 is gaussian , then for a general protocol @xmath23 in : @xmath60 for all times @xmath6 .    that fluctuation symmetry is easily checked to hold also for quadratic potentials which are more general than .",
    "one could argue that any gaussian distributed observable can be made to satisfy a fluctuation theorem by rescaling the mean and the variance .",
    "however , that is not what happens here : no scaling at all is required for the work @xmath59 to satisfy the exact fluctuation symmetry .",
    "+ for more general potentials , we start by specifying a general condition : + * assumption : * we assume that there exists an involution @xmath61 on path - space , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and such that @xmath64    the involution @xmath61 relates trajectories under the protocol @xmath41 and its time - reversed protocol @xmath65 .",

    "then assumption and hence the efs are verified .",
    "the efs for the harmonic case @xmath74 with constant velocity @xmath75 as in , see @xcite , is treated by proposition [ prop : harmonic ] but is of course also a special case of proposition [ prop : cases ] .",

    "we can then safely assume that the trajectory satisfies @xmath79 and gives that the work @xmath80 .",

    "for the fluctuations of the heat we start from a situation where we already have the efs for the ( dissipative ) work .",

    "the reduced variables @xmath267 can for example be chosen to consist of the microscopic trajectory for the system and of the sequence of energies of the environment . for a thermal environment at all times in equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath9",
    ", we thus get @xmath268 where @xmath3 is the heat that flowed into the reservoir . on the other hand we can take @xmath250 and @xmath251 as equilibrium distributions , say of the weak coupling form @xmath269 where @xmath270 combines the micro - state @xmath271 of the system and the energy @xmath263 of the environment",
    ", @xmath272 describes the reservoir - distribution , @xmath273 is the energy of the system with parameter @xmath41 . similarly , @xmath274 if we have that @xmath275 , i.e. , that the energy exchanges to the environment remain small compared to the dispersion of the energy distribution in the reservoir , we get from in that context that @xmath276 which is a version of the jarzynski relation .",
    "for the fluctuation symmetry we are interested in the large deviations of @xmath277 from its average as @xmath193 .",
    "such deviations can arise from two sources .",
    "first there are the large deviations of the work @xmath44 , which however , we know , satisfies an efs .",
    "secondly there is the possibility that @xmath278 also fluctuates to order @xmath6 .",
    "this second effect is responsible for the deviations from the standard fluctuation relation .",
    "after all , an energy is typically exponentially distributed and we can thus expect a competition with the fluctuations of the work . + in order to clearly see the influence of the unboundedness of the temporal boundary , we consider here the simplest set - up in which deviations from the standard fluctuation symmetry can be calculated exactly .",
    "+ we consider a particle moving under the influence of a quadratic potential and a random force . for each time step",
    "@xmath279 we take the work done on the particle @xmath280 to be a random variable distributed according to a gaussian of average @xmath281 and variance @xmath282 .",
    "although a more general scenario is of course possible .",
    "] let us also consider the analogue of the work as the sum @xmath283 . by construction ,",
    "the work per unit time @xmath284 is again gaussian with average @xmath285 and variance @xmath286 .",
    "if @xmath287 , then , automatically , the probability density function @xmath288 satisfies , for all @xmath6 , @xmath289 that is the ( gaussian ) analogue of the exact fluctuation symmetry for the work ( that we here , by the previous construction , assume from the start ) .",
    "+ we now consider a new random variable ( the analogue of the heat ) : @xmath290\\ ] ] where @xmath291 are real parameters , with density @xmath292 .",
    "the aim of our toy model is to compute @xmath293 that can follow from @xmath294 with @xmath295 the large deviation rate function of the heat : @xmath296 .",
    "the function @xmath295 is the legendre transform of the generating function @xmath297 with @xmath298 where , collectively , @xmath299 and @xmath300 represent their mean while @xmath301 corresponds to the covariance matrix of @xmath302 . doing the gaussian integrals in ( [ eq : en ] ) and taking the limit @xmath303 leads to @xmath304\\\\[3mm]\\ + \\infty                     & { \\rm otherwise } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath305 .",
