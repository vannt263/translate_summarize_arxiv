    "we will now attempt to determine those sets @xmath377 for which @xmath367 .",
    "the remainder of this section will be devoted to answering this question .",
    "we will reduce this question to an equivalent geometric question in @xmath378 where , as above , @xmath378 denotes a hyperplane in @xmath257 , the quotient geometry of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath254 .    to do this we will fix some subspace @xmath379 such that @xmath380 . choose an identification of one of the cosets @xmath258 , say @xmath258 , with @xmath381 .",
    "choose this identification so that the unique point @xmath382 is the point identified with the zero vector in @xmath381 .",
    "note that with this identification if @xmath383 correspond to @xmath384 respectively then @xmath385 corresponds to @xmath386 .",
    "now for each point @xmath387 of @xmath388 there exists a unique point @xmath77 of @xmath381 such that @xmath389 . for",

    "this partitioning of @xmath388 induces a partitioning of @xmath31 : @xmath392 where @xmath393 .",
    "similarly we have the partitioning of @xmath17 : @xmath394 where @xmath395 for all @xmath396 .",
    "[ partition example ] take @xmath397 and @xmath398 .",
    "put @xmath399 , @xmath400 and @xmath401 .",

    "then @xmath413 as required .",
    "we take @xmath414 to be the coset containing @xmath415 say .",
    "thus @xmath416 and @xmath417 .",
    "then for example if we choose our identification so that @xmath418 corresponds to @xmath419 we have @xmath420 .    now the useful property of this partition is that for @xmath421 we have @xmath422 .",
    "thus @xmath367 if and only if for every @xmath423 we have @xmath424 .",
    "note that the partition of @xmath31 yields a partition of @xmath425 : @xmath426 furthermore @xmath367 if and only if for every @xmath423 we have @xmath427    thus we have proved the following proposition :    [ partition criterion ] let @xmath428 and suppose @xmath429 for all @xmath430 . then @xmath1 is a complete cap if and only if the partition of @xmath431 induced by @xmath31 satisfies equation  [ partition condition ] for all @xmath423 .",
    "[ partition cap example ] we continue with the notation of the previous example . thus @xmath432 . hence to obtain a complete cap @xmath1 we require a partition of @xmath433 into 4 subsets , @xmath434 satisfying equation  [ partition condition ] for all @xmath435 .",
    "it is not too difficult to find such partitions .",

    "this partition corresponds to the complete cap @xmath440 where which @xmath441 and @xmath442 .",
    "let @xmath443 denote the complement of a hyperplane @xmath444 of @xmath445 .",

    "if @xmath450 and @xmath451 then we say the secant line through @xmath452 and @xmath453 is of type @xmath454 .",
    "equation  [ partition condition ] is the condition that every point of @xmath444 lies on at least one secant line of type @xmath137 for all @xmath423 . since @xmath455 and since there are @xmath456 secant lines we must have @xmath457 .",
    "thus @xmath458 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath459 then every point of @xmath444 must lie on exactly one secant line of each type @xmath423 .",

    "also @xmath464 .",
    "since @xmath465 , this gives @xmath466 .",

    "clearly , if a partition of @xmath446 exists which satisfies equation  [ partition condition ] for some value @xmath468 of @xmath13 then such a partition exists for all values of @xmath13 less than @xmath468 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a complete cap in @xmath93 satisfying @xmath469 . then @xmath470 where @xmath471 is a complete cap in a hyperplane @xmath472 . in particular , @xmath473 .",
    ". then @xmath33 is periodic with vertex @xmath475 . by lemma",
    "[ sebastiens lemma ] , @xmath1 is also periodic with vertex @xmath103 .",
    "choose any hyperplane @xmath476 of @xmath2 not containing @xmath103 and put @xmath477 .",
    "then @xmath470 ( with respect to the vertex @xmath103 ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is complete in @xmath2 , it follows that @xmath478 is complete in @xmath476 .",
    "also the hyperplane @xmath479 of @xmath476 is a tangent hyperplane for @xmath478 and thus @xmath480 .",
    "hence @xmath481 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath1 is a complete cap meeting a hyperplane @xmath19 in 3 points .",
    "choose a codimension 2 subspace @xmath483 contained in @xmath19 and disjoint from @xmath1 .",
    "write @xmath484 .",
    "then @xmath485 is a line in @xmath17 .",
    "put @xmath486 . then @xmath487 and @xmath488 .",
    "thus @xmath482 implies that we are in the case described in section  [ family ] with @xmath398 .",
    "thus by theorem  [ sufficient conditions ] ( and remark  [ t or u odd ] ) we have maximal caps with @xmath482 of all cardinalities @xmath489 where @xmath490 or @xmath491 , i.e. , of cardinalities @xmath492 for @xmath493 .",
    "now we show that there for all @xmath320 there exist complete caps with @xmath482 and with @xmath366 for all @xmath494 . by proposition  [ partition criterion ]",
    "we must find a partition of @xmath495 into 4 subsets indexed by @xmath496 satisfying equation  [ partition condition ] .",
    "there are very many ways to do this .",
    "we give one construction here .",
    "we proceed by induction on @xmath497 . since we have assumed that @xmath498 the first case is @xmath499 .",
    "we exhibited such a partition for @xmath499 in example  [ partition example ] .",
    "now we will inductively construct from this example a partition for all values of @xmath500 .",
    "suppose we have a partition of @xmath446 into four sets @xmath501 , @xmath502 , @xmath503 and @xmath504 where we further suppose that @xmath505 .",

    "then @xmath508 . let @xmath509 .",
    "we partition @xmath510 into 4 sets : @xmath511 by defining @xmath512 .",
    "this partition almost satisfies equation  [ partition condition ] .",
    "however the point @xmath513 is not contained in any of the three sets @xmath514 , @xmath515 and @xmath516 . to overcome this defect",
    "we modify the partition slightly .",
    "note that every point of @xmath517 different from @xmath83 lies on at least two secants of each type @xmath518 .",
    "consider the three points of @xmath446 : @xmath519 , @xmath520 and @xmath521 and the line in @xmath444 : @xmath522 , @xmath523 and @xmath524 .",
    "each of the three points of this line lies on secants of all types which do not utilize @xmath525 nor @xmath526 .",
    "specifically we have @xmath527 , @xmath528 and @xmath529 .",
    "we shift @xmath530 into @xmath531 , @xmath532 into @xmath533 and @xmath534 into @xmath535 .",
    "this modified partition now satisfies equation  [ partition condition ] .",
    "also note that we have not shifted any of the points @xmath536 nor indeed any of the points of @xmath446 and so our induction proceeds using the same points @xmath536 at each stage .",
    "in conclusion we see that there are complete caps , @xmath1 in @xmath12 with @xmath482 of cardinality @xmath537 for all @xmath538 .",
    "thus we have the following .",
    "suppose @xmath493 and that @xmath1 is a complete cap in @xmath12 .",
    "further suppose that @xmath1 meets a hyperplane @xmath19 of @xmath12 in exactly 3 points .",
    "then @xmath190 is one of the numbers : @xmath539 or , if @xmath540 , @xmath190 may also be @xmath537 or @xmath541",
    ". moreover complete caps of all these sizes exist for all corresponding values of @xmath11 .",
    "in this section we assume that @xmath1 is a complete cap meeting a hyperplane @xmath19 in 4 points . as usual",
    "we choose a codimension 2 subspace @xmath8 contained in @xmath19 and disjoint from @xmath1 .",
    "note that when @xmath543 there are two possibilities ; either these four points lie in a fano plane or they do not .",
    "now if they do lie in a fano plane they form a periodic set and it follows as in section  [ double plane ] that if @xmath1 complete then @xmath544 and @xmath1 is large .",
    "it remains to consider the case where @xmath545 consists of four points spanning a three dimensional projective subspace of @xmath19 . in order to determine all solutions to equation  [ coset equations ] we first assume that this three dimensional subspace is @xmath19 and thus that @xmath546 . without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath547 , @xmath548 , @xmath549 and @xmath550 . thus @xmath551 and @xmath552 .",
    "let @xmath553 denote the group of projectivities of @xmath554 which stabilize , @xmath33 , @xmath411 , @xmath555 and @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath553 contains the subgroup @xmath114 of projectivities which permute the points @xmath556 and @xmath557 and which also fix the point @xmath558 .",
    "the group @xmath553 also contains the projectivities @xmath559 and @xmath560 defined by : @xmath561 , @xmath562 , @xmath563 , @xmath564 and @xmath565 and @xmath566 , @xmath567 , @xmath568 , @xmath569 , and @xmath570 .",
    "suppose that @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy equation  [ coset equations ] and further that @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not correspond to either trivial or singleton solutions of that equation .",
    "thus @xmath571 and @xmath572 .",
    "since @xmath553 acts transitively on @xmath39 we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath573 .",
    "now the subgroup of @xmath553 fixing @xmath574 contains the group @xmath114 .",
    "the action of @xmath114 decomposes the remaining points of @xmath39 into two orbits : @xmath575 and @xmath576 .",
    "thus without loss of generality we have two cases to consider : ( i ) @xmath577 and ( ii ) @xmath578 . these two cases are distinguished by the fact that in the former case the point @xmath579 lies on the secant through the two given points of @xmath31 while in the latter case it does not .",
    "thus we find only one new solution to equation  [ coset equations ] .",
    "this solution is determined by @xmath587 , @xmath588 , and @xmath589 where @xmath590 .",
    "note that @xmath591 .",
    "thus we have five solutions in total : the two trivial solutions , the two singleton solutions and this new solution .",
    "notice that for the new solution and for both of the singleton solutions we have @xmath592 and @xmath593 . since @xmath594 ,",
    "if @xmath1 is complete there must be at least one @xmath50 for which the trivial solution occurs .",
    "in particular , we may apply theorem  [ sufficient conditions ] to obtain complete caps @xmath1 with @xmath542 and @xmath33 not periodic .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a complete cap with @xmath542 . if @xmath33 is periodic then @xmath595 .",
    "suppose then that @xmath33 is not periodic and that @xmath596 of the pairs of cosets @xmath597 utilize the new solution , @xmath327 of them utilize singleton solutions and @xmath598 of them utilize the trivial solution .",
