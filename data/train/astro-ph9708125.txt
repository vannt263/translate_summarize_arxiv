    "the large - scale distribution of galaxies at early epochs provides a powerful means of discriminating amongst various cosmological world models and mechanisms for the formation of structure ( see , e.g. , white 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the most comprehensive surveys of the large  scale distribution of galaxies have been carried out in the relatively `` local '' universe ( e.g. , shectman _",
    "et al . _",
    "1996 ) , while hints of what is happening at larger redshifts ( @xmath19 ) have been obtained using pencil ",
    "beam apparent - magnitude limited redshift surveys ( e.g. , broadhurst _",

    "a general result seems to be that the ( small scale ) correlation function of the more distant galaxies is reduced significantly in amplitude relative to the present time ( e.g. , efstathiou 1995 , brainerd _",
    "et al . _",
    "1995 , le fvre _ et al . _",
    "1996 , etc . ) , while on larger scales the one - dimensional , `` line  of  sight '' structures appear to be quite prominent to at least @xmath20 , with a typical comoving distance between structures of @xmath21 mpc along the line of sight .",
    "it is not yet clear how these two observational results should be combined to form a coherent picture , since it is so difficult to obtain information in the `` transverse '' direction in surveys of faint galaxies , so that the nature of the structures giving rise to the `` spikes '' in one - dimensional redshift surveys is ambiguous ( kaiser & peacock 1991 ) .",
    "locally , at least , it appears that the line of sight structures seen in the pencil - beam surveys are likely to be related to the cell  like `` wall  void '' geometry seen in more extensive , large solid - angle redshift surveys ( e.g. , de lapparent _ et al . _  1986 ,",
    "landy _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) .",
    "in addition to the difficulties presented by the `` geometry '' of very deep redshift surveys , it is not clear to what extent galaxies are reliable tracers of mass , particularly at high redshifts where a large degree of `` bias '' is expected for objects forming within massive dark matter halos ( e.g. , bardeen _ et al . _  1986 , brainerd & villumsen 1992 , mo & fukugita 1996 , baugh _ et al",
    "however , a measurement of the bias of a class of objects at high redshift ( and the evolution of the bias with redshift ) can be used to constrain the connection between the sites of their formation and the overall mass distribution , which can in turn be used to constrain models of structure and galaxy formation ( e.g. , cole & kaiser 1989 , mo & white 1996 ) .    in this paper , we present the first results of a large survey of the galaxy distribution at @xmath13 .",

    "keck telescopes allows an assessment of the growth of structure in the galaxy distribution at significantly higher redshift than has been previously accessible . in a separate paper ( giavalisco _",
    "et al . _",
    "1997 ) , we analyze the angular correlation function of the photometrically selected @xmath13 galaxy candidates in a number of fields . here",
    "we focus on a single field in which we have obtained the most complete spectroscopic observations to date , with data analogous to `` pencil beam '' surveys at smaller redshifts . aside from probing the structures traced by galaxies at significantly earlier epochs than has been possible previously , working at @xmath22 also has the advantage that a reasonable angular scale for multi - object spectroscopy on large telescopes maps onto relatively large _ co - moving _ scales ; our field size of 9by 18at @xmath22 traces ( transverse ) structure equivalent to a field 24by 48at @xmath23 . as we will discuss below , the relatively large transverse co - moving scale provides a distinct advantage in assessing the galaxy clustering properties on scales that remain in the linear regime to the present day , allowing for a relatively straightforward analytic treatment .",
    "in this paper we use the the first observations of relatively large scale structure traced by star forming galaxies at @xmath13 to estimate the amount by which this population must be biased relative to the overall mass distribution expected for standard cosmological models .",
    "the measurement of this bias will allow us to infer a corresponding dark matter halo mass scale , and makes possible future direct comparisons with gravitational n - body and semi - analytic simulations of early structure formation .",
    "we will show that the implied halo mass scale of the `` lyman break galaxies '' supports the conclusion that they likely represent the progenitors of the massive galaxies of the present epoch ( steidel _ et al . _  1996a , giavalisco , steidel , & machetto 1996 , mo & fukugita 1996 , baugh _ et al . _",
    "the present work focuses on one of the fields in a survey for @xmath13 galaxies based on ground - based images in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 photometric system ( steidel & hamilton 1993 ) , which is designed to be sensitive to the lyman break in objects having redshifts primarily in the range @xmath27 .",
    "a complete description of the observations and techniques used in this survey will be published elsewhere ( steidel _ et al . _",
    "the field under discussion consists of two adjacent pointings of the palomar 5 m hale telescope with the cosmic prime focus camera .",

    "the northern field is centered on the `` ssa22 '' deep redshift survey field of cowie _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) , at @xmath31 @xmath32 15  01(j2000 ) , and includes most of a nearby region observed as part of the canada - france redshift survey ( lilly _ et al . _",
    "the southern field is centered 525  south of that position .",
    "the size of the full contiguous field is 1764 in the n - s direction and 874 in the e - w direction .",
    "we refer to the two separate pointings `` ssa22a '' and `` ssa22b '' for the northern and southern fields , respectively .",
    "spectroscopic observations of `` lyman break '' candidates were obtained using the keck i telescope in 1995 october and 1996 august , and using the keck ii telescope in its first week of scientific observations during 1996 october .",
    "we obtained spectra of as many candidates as possible by using 7 different slit masks with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) , each covering roughly 4by 7regions and including @xmath331520 candidate objects per mask .",
    "typical total exposure times were 1.53 hours per mask , in separate 1800s integrations .",
    "the resolution of the spectra , using a 300 line mm@xmath34 grating , was approximately 12  , and the grating tilt was adjusted so that the wavelength coverage for each slit included the 4300 - 7000   range .",
    "objects were assigned slits based on a number of factors , the most important being the maximization of the number of @xmath22 candidates on each mask .",
    "objects were prioritized on the basis of how unambiguously the lyman discontinuity could be discerned from the broad - band photometry .",
    "about two - thirds of the objects discussed here satisfied our `` robust '' color criteria ( see steidel _",
    "et al . _",
    "1995 ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , while the rest were selected using our `` marginal '' criteria , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38 . in practice ,",
    "most of the `` marginal '' candidates that have been observed spectroscopically also have @xmath39 in order to maximize the number of galaxies in the desired redshift range , @xmath27 .",
    "a total of 181 objects satisfy these adopted color criteria in the survey region , of which 113 satisfy the `` robust '' color criteria .",
    "details of the selection criteria and the resulting redshift selection function will be presented elsewhere ( steidel _ et al . _  1997",
    "; dickinson _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "approximately 80% of the objects assigned slits resulted in redshifts , with 78 objects having @xmath40 and 59 having @xmath27 . with the exception of a small amount of contamination by galactic stars ( approximately 5% of the objects satisfying the color criteria turn out to be galactic stars , although there is essentially no contamination by stars for objects fainter than @xmath41 ) , all identified color  selected objects are at high redshift ( @xmath40 )",
    ". some of the spectra which remain unidentified may be objects at somewhat lower redshift than our primary selection window , since then the strongest spectral features would fall in regions of much lower instrumental sensitivity ; however , there is no obvious trend with either @xmath42 color or apparent @xmath26 magnitude for the unsuccessful redshifts .",
    "a higher success rate was achieved during 1996 october due to much improved photometry and ( therefore ) photometric selection , and also higher quality slit masks .",
    "nine of the objects with confirmed redshifts @xmath40 ( most having @xmath43 ) were subsequently shown not to satisfy either of the above selection categories on the basis of the improved photometry ; in addition , two @xmath44 objects were found serendipitously on slits designed for color  selected objects .",
    "for consistency , in the present paper we confine ourselves to only the 67 @xmath45 objects satisfying the adopted photometric selection criteria given above , for which an accurate redshift selection function has been determined from the results of our spectroscopy in a number of different fields .",
    "the redshifts of the galaxies in the sample were measured from strong absorption features in the rest  frame far ",
    "uv , mostly of interstellar origin ( see steidel _ et al . _",
    "1996a , lowenthal _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) and , when present , the lyman @xmath46 emission line .",
    "for spectra in which both absorption and emission are present , the redshifts defined by lyman @xmath46 emission are systematically higher than the absorption line redshifts by @xmath47 , or @xmath48 km  s@xmath34 . based on limited near - ir spectroscopy of some of the high redshift galaxies ( pettini _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) it appears that neither the emission lines nor the absorption lines actually coincide with the true systemic redshift of the galaxy ; the `` true '' redshift probably lies in between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this uncertainty probably dominates over any measurement uncertainties , and so we adopt the standard deviation of the velocity difference as the typical uncertainty of the measured redshifts , @xmath51 km  s@xmath34 . because most of the spectra exhibit lyman @xmath46 emission at some level , whereas a smaller number of spectra exhibit only absorption features , we have adopted the position of lyman @xmath46 emission as the primary redshift indicator .",
    "a histogram of the @xmath40 galaxies ( and the two faint qsos which were discovered using the same photometric technique ) in the ssa22a+b field sample is given in figure 1 , with a bin size of @xmath52 , or @xmath53 km  s@xmath34at @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution of the objects on the plane of the sky for both the spectroscopically confirmed and photometric candidate @xmath13 samples is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the most striking feature in the redshift histogram is the `` spike '' of 15 objects at @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , one of the two @xmath45 objects whose spectrum was obtained serendipitously also falls within the same redshift bin .",
    "the spectra of all 16 objects in this narrow redshift range are plotted in figure 3 , and the relative positions and photometry for the same objects summarized in table 1 .",
    "we will not include the serendipitous object ssa22a s1 in the analysis that follows , but it is intriguing that an object with strong lyman @xmath46 emission ( but very weak continuum ) was found despite the very small effective solid angle covered by the mask slitlets .",
    "while spectroscopy in several fields suggests that our @xmath55 selection criteria find galaxies over the broad range @xmath18 ( steidel _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , in this field , the one we have sampled most densely , nearly one quarter of the redshifts lie between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . a concentration",
    "this strong is unlikely to arise from poisson sampling of our selection function  using the statistical technique described in the appendix we find that only 1 in 400 data sets generated by randomly drawing redshifts from our selection function ( figure 1 ) contain as significant a departure from poisson expectations  and so this group of galaxies almost certainly indicates a true peak in the density field at @xmath58 . from figure 1",
    "the approximate galaxy overdensity at this redshift is @xmath59 . at first glance",
    "this seems surprisingly large : in the local universe the rms mass fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath60 mpc is @xmath61 , and since ( for @xmath11 ) each bin in the histogram corresponds to a comoving volume of @xmath62 mpc@xmath63 we expect the relative mass fluctuation among bins @xmath64 to be approximately @xmath65 . yet the bin at @xmath58 contains a galaxy overdensity @xmath66 that is 25 times larger than the expected @xmath64 . in this section",
    "we will see what we can learn from the existence of this single large galaxy overdensity",
    ". the main conclusion will be the obvious one : lyman - break galaxies must be very biased tracers of mass .",
    "a more complete analysis of the galaxy distribution at @xmath22 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our approach will be straight - forward .",
    "we will calculate a mass associated with the spike , treat the spike as a peak in the density field smoothed on this mass scale , and then calculate the probability of observing a peak so high within our survey volume for three representative cosmologies ( @xmath11 , @xmath9  open , and @xmath67  flat ) .",
    "the mass scale and peak height both depend on the bias parameter @xmath68 , and we will see how large the bias must be in order to make it reasonably probable that we would have observed the spike in our survey volume .    the first step is to calculate the mass associated with the spike . for concreteness we will consider only the 15 objects between @xmath56 and @xmath57 to be associated with the `` spike '' structure .",
    "this is the interval that maximizes the significance of the spike according to the statistical technique in the appendix , and within it there is no evidence for substructure .",
    "a two - sample two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( press _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) ) shows at the 95% level that galaxies in the spike have a different areal distribution from spectroscopically observed galaxies outside the spike , so the apparent `` edge '' of the spike in the southern half of the field ( figure  2 ) is probably real .",
    "there is not much evidence though that we have observed an edge to the spike in any other direction , and thus we can only set a lower limit to its transverse size of @xmath33 9@xmath69 115 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "this is corresponds to @xmath70 by @xmath71 comoving mpc@xmath72 .",
    "the effective depth of the structure for the same cosmology is @xmath73 comoving mpc , where @xmath74 takes into account the redshift space distortions caused by peculiar velocities .",
    "the mass associated with the structure is therefore @xmath75m@xmath7 , provides a _ much _ larger co - moving field of view and so we are able to set a correspondingly larger lower limit to the size of structures we observe . given our much sparser sampling density , we are probably sensitive _ only _ to structures on relatively large angular scales ; because the relevant mass scales are ( potentially ) so different , the relationship between this structure and those seen in other pencil - beam surveys is not at all clear . ] where @xmath76 is the mean density of the universe and @xmath77 , the mass overdensity , is related to the observed galaxy overdensity @xmath78 through @xmath79 .",
    "following the prescription in the appendix we estimate a galaxy overdensity in this region of @xmath80 .    it remains to estimate @xmath81 . in principle",
    "we do not even know if @xmath81 is greater or less than 1 : a collapsing object will appear more dense in redshift space than in real space , while an object that has already collapsed and virialized will appear less dense in redshift space .",
    "we will see below though that it is difficult to produce even a moderately non - linear overdensity on this mass scale at @xmath82 , and so we will make the conservative assumption that we are observing an object which is just breaking away from the hubble expansion rather than an object which has already collapsed . in this case",
    "we can use the zeldovich approximation to correct for peculiar velocities . in the zeldovich approximation",
    "each mass element maintains its linear - theory velocity , and as a result the density of a fluid element evolves according to @xmath83^{-1}$ ] where the @xmath84 are initial eigenvalues of the tensor of deformation and @xmath85 is the linear - growth factor .",
    "high peaks in the density field are roughly isotropic ( bardeen _ et al . _  1986 ) , and so we can reasonably use a simple expression for the redshift - distortion factor @xmath81 ( _ e.g. _ padmanabhan ( 1993  ",
    "8) ) that holds when we view a collapsing object along a principal axis : @xmath86 where @xmath87 ( lahav _ et al . _",
    "1991 ) . for @xmath88",
    "this becomes @xmath89 , which is the expression we use .",
    "after we have estimated the peak height @xmath90 ( defined below ) , we can return to this peculiar - velocity correction and gauge how wrong our assumption of isotropy is likely to have been . in the high - peak limit",
    "the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor have approximate relative sizes @xmath91 @xmath92 ( bond 1988 ) .",
    "we will see below that @xmath90 ranges from 25 for the parameter values we consider ( table 2 ) , and so the assumption of isotropy is poor in some cases .",
    "fortunately the peculiar - velocity correction is smallest when the assumption is worst , and in the end our conclusions would not be affected much by the expected level of anisotropy .",
    "we make a crude attempt to quantify this by randomly rotating a deformation tensor with eigenvalues in the `` typical '' ratio above and calculating the exact peculiar velocity correction for each rotation . even in the worst case ( @xmath93 )",
    "the @xmath94 spread in @xmath81 is only about 10% across the randomly rotated ensemble .",
    "this is small compared to the poisson uncertainty in @xmath78 and will be neglected .",
    "we can now calculate @xmath95 and @xmath77 for any assumed bias .",
    "selected values are shown in table 2 .",
    "the final step is to calculate whether the density field smoothed on mass scale @xmath95 would plausibly contain a peak of height @xmath77 in our survey volume .",
    "this will let us assess whether an assumed bias value is consistent with the existence of the spike . because rms fluctuations on the ( large ) mass scale @xmath95 are much smaller than unity , the smoothed density field should be well approximated by linearly evolved initial conditions , and we should be able to use linear theory to calculate the probability of observing a peak of height @xmath77 .",
    "the one complication is that nonlinear effects may have begun to accelerate the peak s growth ; in order to analyze the spike with linear theory we will need to estimate the linear theory height @xmath96 that corresponds to the measured peak height @xmath77 . spherically - symmetric collapse is one of the few cases where nonlinear growth is quantitatively understood , and it would be convenient if we could use spherical collapse results to correct for nonlinear growth in our spike . but how accurately can we model the growth of a peak through spherical collapse ?",
    "one issue is whether the peak is likely to have been roughly spherical in the first place , and we saw above this is strongly affected by its height @xmath97 where @xmath29 is the rms relative mass fluctuation on the mass scale of the spike .",
    "a second issue is whether the previous collapse of smaller perturbations within the peak could generate non - radial motions large enough to slow down  or prevent  the peak s collapse ( _ e.g. _ peebles 1990 ) .",
    "this depends on the spectral index of density fluctuations @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , because ( for fixed @xmath100 ) @xmath98 controls the level of small - scale power .",
    "bernardeau ( 1994 ) argues that for @xmath101 and @xmath102 typical peaks _ will _ grow at roughly the rate predicted by the spherical collapse model , at least until @xmath103 , and this conclusion is supported by the @xmath104-body experiment of thomas & couchman ( 1992 ) . since in all scenarios",
    "considered the spike overdensity satisfies @xmath101 , and since cdm spectra on the mass scales of interest to us have effective spectral indices @xmath105 , we will adopt the spherical collapse @xmath106 transformation as approximated by bernardeau : @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "this should at least give us a lower limit on @xmath96 , since previous collapse on smaller scales ( which we have neglected ) slows down non - linear growth .",
    "table 2 shows two estimates of the number density of regions with mass overdensity @xmath108 for each cosmology and bias value . the first estimate @xmath109 is the number density @xmath110 of peaks of height @xmath108 in the gaussian - smoothed density field , from bardeen _ et al .",

    "both @xmath109 and @xmath113 have been normalized to units of 1 over our survey volume , which we will take to be an 18by 9rectangular field between @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath116 in this table , then we would expect to see on average one peak with linear height @xmath117 in a volume this size , and the corresponding bias value and cosmology are roughly consistent with the existence of the spike .",

    "it is clear from table  2 and figure  4 that an overdensity similar to the one we observe would not occur in any of these cosmologies unless lyman - break galaxies were very biased tracers of mass .",

    "a second qso , called ssa22a d14 , has @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and even at the coarse resolution ( @xmath144 ) of our survey spectra several metal line absorption systems are evident ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "there is a probable damped lyman alpha system at @xmath145 , an optically thick lyman limit system at @xmath146 , and another metal line system having a relatively strong lyman @xmath46 absorption line and also the c  iv @xmath147 doublet at @xmath148 .",

    "we also note that there is no confirmed lyman break galaxy or photometrically selected candidate that is near enough to the sightline of ssa22a d14 to be ( plausibly ) responsible for any of these absorption systems , adding to the growing number of high redshift absorption systems that are fainter than our typical limits for the detection of lyman break galaxies , @xmath150 ( see steidel _ et al . _",
    "it would clearly be of great interest to obtain a higher resolution spectrum of ssa22a d14 so that the nature of the absorption line systems could be better discerned .",

    "the fortuitous placement of two reasonably bright qsos within the ssa22 field is obviously of great interest for a comparison of the structure seen in emission versus that seen in absorption along the same line of sight .",
    "although the significance is not completely clear , the fact that all three of the most prominent features in the redshift histogram have counterparts in metal line absorption systems is particularly intriguing ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "1996 ) and suggestive of large  scale coherence ( with large covering fraction ) in the overall distribution of gas and stars at high redshift . while suggestions of large scale structure in absorbing gas from correlations of qso absorption line systems ( both transverse to and along the line of sight ) have been many ( e.g. jakobsen _ et al . _  1986 ; sargent & steidel 1987 ; steidel & sargent 1992 ; dinshaw and impey 1996 ; williger _ et al . _",
    "1996 , quashnock _ et al . _",

    "an interesting sidelight is that the volume of one of our survey fields ( @xmath33 few @xmath157 mpc@xmath63 ) is well - matched to the present - day density of x - ray selected clusters with @xmath158 kev ( @xmath159 mpc@xmath160 ( eke _ et al . _  1996",
    ") ) . in an average field of this volume",
    "we would expect to see 0.3 , 1.0 , 1.1 structure that is destined to become a cluster by the present day for @xmath11 , @xmath9 open , @xmath67 flat , and this raises the possibility that structure we have found at @xmath58 may be an abell cluster in its infancy .",
    "it is on the right mass scale , and ( depending on the bias ) its linear overdensity @xmath96 when evolved to the present day could reach the spherical top - hat threshold of @xmath161 for collapse and virialization .",
    "given the sampling density of the photometrically selected candidates in the ssa22a+b field , we have probably only found @xmath162% of the objects in the @xmath163 structure to the same apparent magnitude level .",
    "if each lyman - break galaxy is the progenitor of a present - day galaxy brighter than @xmath164 , this would imply @xmath162 such galaxies within the structure , lending further support to the notion that the `` spike '' is a proto - cluster .",
    "in many respects the structure we have identified is very similar to a less evolved version of the structure found at @xmath165 by le fvre _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) as part of the cfrs redshift survey .",
    "the results we have presented above are based on a single field of a `` targeted '' redshift survey using lyman break photometric selection criteria and focusing on the redshift range @xmath18 .",
    "a larger sample will test the validity of the conclusions outlined here and will give a full picture of the correlation function of star  forming galaxies at high redshift on scales from kpc to tens of mpc . whether or not one can reach significant cosmological conclusions on the basis of only about 70 redshifts in one field , we regard it as extremely promising that one can now feasibly _ observe _ the large  scale distribution of galaxies at very early epochs .",
    "we would also like to emphasize how efficiently one can address these issues by using photometric methods to `` pre - select '' the volume / epoch studied .",

    "we use a simple method to look for clustering in the galaxy redshifts . rather than place the redshifts into bins and look for unusually crowded bins ( _ e.g. _ cohen _ et al .",
    "1996a ) , we scan our unbinned data for galaxy pairs , triplets , quartets , and so on whose redshifts are closer together than we would expect from poisson statistics . if the product of our selection function and the density of lyman - break galaxies were equal to a known constant @xmath166 over the redshift range of interest , then without clustering the probability that a group of @xmath104 galaxies would span a redshift interval @xmath167 would be given by the the erlangian distribution ( eadie _ et al . _",
    "1971 ) @xmath168 in this case it would be easy to find significantly clustered groups of galaxies ; we could simply consider each group of @xmath104 neighboring galaxies in turn , and calculate the probability that in the absence of clustering they would be contained in a redshift interval smaller than the observed @xmath169 : @xmath170 with @xmath171 , the ( unnormalized ) incomplete gamma function , given ( _ e.g. _ ) in press _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) .",
    "if this probability were very close to zero , it would suggest that the small separation of the @xmath104 neighbors was inconsistent with poisson sampling of a uniform background , and we would consider those @xmath104 galaxies a cluster candidate .",
    "( in this section we use `` cluster '' to denote an arbitrarily small  or large  group of galaxies whose proximity is unexpected from poisson statistics . )    in practice the product @xmath166 of our selection function and the mean density of lyman - break galaxies is neither precisely known nor constant with redshift , and so we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we estimate the shape of @xmath172 by placing the redshifts of all our spectroscopically - confirmed marginal and robust lyman - break galaxies ( there are 208 , of which 69 are in ssa22a or ssa22b ) into bins of width @xmath173 , and fitting the resulting histogram with a cubic spline ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "we then transform our redshifts @xmath132 into a coordinate system @xmath174 in which @xmath166 is roughly constant , and the problem is reduced to searching for significantly clustered groups of galaxies in the midst of a constant poisson background of unknown intensity @xmath166 .",
    "this is just the `` on source / off source '' problem familiar from high - energy astrophysics , where we observe @xmath175 counts during a time interval @xmath176 in one part of the sky , and @xmath177 during @xmath178 in another , and must decide whether there is any evidence for an intrinsically higher count rate in region 2 . in our case",
    "we want to decide whether there is evidence for the presence of a cluster ( _ i.e. _ an elevated count rate ) in the redshift interval @xmath178 between two arbitrarily selected galaxies .",
    "we begin by estimating the `` background count rate '' @xmath166 from the density of galaxies outside this candidate cluster .",
    "if there are @xmath175 galaxies at redshifts less than or equal to the lowest - redshift cluster member and @xmath179 galaxies at redshifts greater than or equal to the highest - redshift cluster member , bayes theorem gives @xmath180 where @xmath176 is the interval between the lowest - redshift galaxy in our sample and the lowest - redshift cluster member , and @xmath181 is the interval between the highest - redshift cluster member and the highest - redshift galaxy in our sample . with this probabilistic distribution for @xmath166",
    ", we can proceed analogously to the case above where @xmath166 was known exactly . since the probability that the group of @xmath177 galaxies would be contained in _",
    "exactly _ the observed interval @xmath178 is    @xmath182 the probability that they would be contained in an interval smaller than the observed @xmath178 is @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 is the incomplete beta function ( press _ et al . _  1994 ) , and we have substituted the erlangian distribution for @xmath186 , assumed a uniform prior for @xmath166 over the interval @xmath187 $ ] and taken the limit @xmath188 ( see jaynes ( 1990 ) or loredo ( 1992 ) for more detailed derivations of similar results . )",
    "this expression for @xmath189 lets us assess the degree to which the redshifts of any @xmath177 adjacent galaxies are inconsistent with poisson sampling of a uniform background ; groups of galaxies with @xmath189 very close to 0 ( or to 1 ) are not expected in the absence of clustering , and so by calculating @xmath189 for _ all _ groups of @xmath177 adjacent galaxies in our sample , with @xmath190 , we can locate the most statistically significant clusters ( or voids ) in our redshift distribution . in practice",
    "we restrict our attention to clusters ( or voids ) with @xmath191 , since larger features are interpreted with this technique as part of the selection function rather than of the galaxy distribution .    after using this procedure to locate candidate clusters in our redshift distribution",
    ", we estimate the significance of each cluster by comparing its @xmath189 to the distribution of @xmath189 in simulated data sets with redshifts randomly drawn from the smooth selection function in fig 1 .",
    "if a candidate cluster has a @xmath189 so small that it appears in only 1 of 100 random data sets , we assign that cluster a significance of 99% .",
    "this technique has the obvious flaws that the estimate of the background level is not correct when there is more than one strong spike in the data , and that we take no account of correlations between galaxies in calculating significances .",
    "neither is critical in the present application , because we have only one dominant spike , and it is on a scale many times larger than the lyman - break galaxy correlation length ( giavalisco _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "once we have identified a significant cluster we may want to associate an overdensity @xmath192 with it though the relationship @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the number density of galaxies within the cluster and @xmath195 is the background number density .",
    "@xmath195 will in general be well determined by the many galaxies outside the cluster , but @xmath194 is more problematic .",
    "we are defining the edge of the cluster to fall _ exactly _ on the lowest- and highest - redshift members , so should we include those two galaxies in estimating @xmath194 ? in  3 we exclude from the @xmath194 calculation any galaxy whose position is explicitly used in defining the cluster boundary .",
    "there are three such galaxies  one sets the low - redshift edge , another the high - redshift edge , and the third sets the southern edge of the cluster ( fig 2)and to estimate estimate @xmath194 we use the formula @xmath196 with @xmath197 .",
