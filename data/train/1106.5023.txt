    "the cms collaboration at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern recently reported the observation of long - range two - particle angular correlations on relative pseudorapidity ( @xmath4 ) for charged particle pairs at mid - rapidity with relative azimuth ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 ( near - side or same - side - ss ) in high multiplicity proton - proton ( p - p ) collisions at @xmath1 = 7 tev  @xcite .",
    "the collaboration noted the visual similarity of this same - side `` ridge '' with two - particle angular correlation structures observed in heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "for the latter , two - dimensional ( 2d ) angular correlation analysis reveals at least two structures which produce same - side , relative @xmath0 elongated correlations : ( 1 ) a quadrupole , @xmath7 , independent of @xmath0 ( within two units at mid - rapidity ) whose amplitude is approximately proportional to the square of the eccentricity of the transverse distribution of colliding nucleons from the impacting nuclei  @xcite , and ( 2 ) a 2d peak centered at ( @xmath8 ) = ( 0,0 ) whose amplitude and width on relative pseudorapidity increase markedly with more central collisions ( i.e. reduced impact parameter )  @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole correlation in heavy ion collisions is conventionally attributed to pressure driven , hydrodynamic flow  @xcite due to rapid equilibration of a partonic medium  @xcite .",
    "inconsistencies between this assumed scenario and other rhic data have been found however  @xcite ; alternate mechanisms for quadrupole correlation production have been studied  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0-elongated 2d peak at rhic is not understood although many ideas have been proposed .",
    "the appearance of one or both of these ridge - like correlation structures in p - p collisions at the lhc would be quite interesting .    a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the @xmath0-elongated 2d correlation peak observed in the heavy ion collision data at rhic .",
    "several of these authors have extended their models to include the cms p - p results .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that flux tubes of color glass condensate  @xcite formed immediately after impact produce correlations among the hadron fragments which are transported outward by an assumed radial flow .",
    "shuryak  @xcite and voloshin  @xcite invoked similar ideas except the initial stage correlations result from beam - jets , which are the fragmentation results of forward going nucleon remnants following semi - hard partonic scattering .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that the same - side ridge is generated by fast parton ( from semi - hard scattering ) - soft , `` thermal '' parton recombination into final - state hadrons .",
    "wong  @xcite explained the same - side ridge by way of scattering ( momentum kick ) between fast , transverse scattered partons and soft partons of a medium .",
    "levin and rezaeian  @xcite argued that the long - range rapidity and azimuth correlations between charged hadron pairs produced from two bfkl parton showers will contribute to the cms ridge .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite interpreted the cms results in terms of energy density fluctuations in the initial collision stage which manifest in the final - state via hydrodynamic expansion ; the relevant correlation being a quadrupole .    within perturbative qcd field  @xcite suggested that initial and final state radiation effects in partonic @xmath2 and @xmath9 processes may contribute to extending the @xmath0 range of the jet correlations .",
    "sjstrand  @xcite and trainor  @xcite independently suggested that fragmenting color flux tubes , as in the lund model of soft particle production  @xcite , stretching between transverse scattered colored partons and longitudinal colored nucleon remnants from semi - hard collisions could produce @xmath0 elongation in the jet correlation peak .",
    "none of the preceding models have been shown to account for all of the correlation  @xcite and @xmath10 spectrum  @xcite features in the heavy - ion data from rhic which are associated with the @xmath0-elongated peak phenomenon .    in a physical model - independent analysis trainor and kettler",
    "@xcite showed that the systematic dependences of the quadrupole correlation amplitude on collision centrality , event multiplicity , and collision energy ( @xmath11 ) determined from rhic heavy - ion data  @xcite , when extrapolated to lhc energies for high multiplicity p - p collision events , predicted quadrupole amplitudes which were in reasonable agreement with the cms near - side ridge .",
    "they suggested that the cms ridge and the quadrupole correlations at rhic have a common dynamical origin , but not necessarily hydrodynamic .",
    "boek  @xcite also showed that the transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) selected azimuth projections of the cms 2d correlations at larger relative pseudorapidity  @xcite were well described with @xmath12 ( dipole ) and @xmath7 ( quadrupole ) terms only .",
    "in the present analysis the 7 tev p - p angular correlation data from the cms experiment were fitted in 2d angular space ( @xmath8 ) using a multi - component model similar to that used to describe angular correlations from au - au collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "four data sets were studied corresponding to combinations of event selection ( minimum - bias or high multiplicity ) and particle @xmath10 selection ( @xmath13  gev/@xmath14 or @xmath15  gev/@xmath14 ) .",
    "additional components ( soft gluon radiation , azimuth quadrupole and same - side gaussian ridge on azimuth ) were included in the fitting model in order to phenomenologically represent the correlation structures expected for each class of theoretical models listed above .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to determine which phenomenological description(s ) of the p - p cms correlation data is preferred based on fit quality in an effort to guide ongoing theoretical studies of the cms ridge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the phenomenological fitting model is explained in the next section ; fitting results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] .",
    "the relation of this analysis to previous studies of these data and the implications of the fitting phenomenology for theoretical models of @xmath0-elongated angular correlations in high energy collisions are discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : v ] .",
    "the two - particle angular correlation distributions from cms  @xcite and the star experiment at rhic  @xcite represent inclusive sums of all charged particle pairs within the tracking acceptances of the respective detectors .",
    "there is no special leading particle or `` trigger '' particle in this type of analysis and in this sense the cms angular correlations may be referred to as _ minimum - bias_. correlations are obtained from normalized , binned ratios of real to mixed - event pairs , the latter being constructed by taking the two particles in a pair from different but similar events . if events produce more than one jet within the acceptance all intra - jet charged particle pairs contribute to the correlation peak at small relative angles near ( 0,0 ) .",
    "inter - jet two - particle correlations are indistinguishable from background for uncorrelated jets .",
    "particle pairs from separate jets of a correlated , back - to - back dijet appear as a broad , opposite - side or away - side ( @xmath16 , as ) ridge on azimuth centered at @xmath17 .",
    "the same - side @xmath0-elongated correlations may or may not be associated with jets ; proximity of correlation structures on relative angle does not necessarily imply proximity in absolute ( @xmath18 ) space .",
    "the primary elements of the present fitting function were developed previously by the star collaboration in order to describe 2d angular correlation data for charged particle production from minimum - bias p - p collisions at @xmath1 = 0.2  tev  @xcite .",
    "those studies used @xmath10 cuts and like - sign and unlike - sign pair combinations to reveal simple geometrical shapes in the correlations .",
    "those structures include : ( 1 ) a jet - like , 2d gaussian peak at small relative angles with an accompanying away - side , @xmath19-independent ridge corresponding to approximately back - to - back dijets ( e.g. pythia predictions in @xcite ) or other @xmath10 conserving correlation effects , ( 2 ) a narrower 2d exponential peak at zero opening angle representing quantum correlations  @xcite among identical charged particles , and ( 3 ) a 1d gaussian ridge on @xmath19 which is the 2d manifestation of charge - ordering first observed on relative @xmath0 in collisions at the isr  @xcite .",
    "the latter is thought to represent longitudinal ( beam direction ) fragmentation as described for example in the lund model  @xcite . with the addition of an @xmath0-independent quadrupole",
    "this phenomenological model quantitatively describes the 2d angular correlation data from minimum - bias au - au collisions at star  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above model components important terms could arise from color coherence effects  @xcite .",
    "soft gluon radiation amplitudes from color connected partons in hard scattering @xmath20 processes interfere producing increased yields in the hard scattering plane defined by the incident and scattered partons . assuming hadronization does not obliterate the soft gluon distribution the resulting final state hadrons will increase the particle yield near the accompanying jet with a larger increase occurring along the beam direction , or on relative pseudorapidity than on relative azimuth .",
    "this next - to - leading - order process may therefore contribute to the cms ridge .",
    "for dijets within the acceptance soft gluon radiation will also contribute to the away - side correlation ridge on azimuth .",
