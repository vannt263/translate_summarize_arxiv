    "there are many approaches to calculate the entropy and the thermodynamics of a black hole .",
    "one can follow the original route where methods of field second quantization in a collapsing object are used to calculate the temperature @xmath2 @xcite , and then uses the black hole laws to find the corresponding entropy @xcite . or one can use the euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity @xcite and its developments @xcite , to obtain those thermodynamic properties @xcite ( see also @xcite and compare with @xcite ) .",
    "there are still other methods .",
    "the method we follow here is the one that builds a lorentzian hamiltonian classical theory of the gravity field and possibly other fields , and then obtain a lorentzian time evolution operator in the schrdinger picture .",
    "afterward one performs a wick rotation from real to imaginary time , in order to find a well defined partition function .",
    "the prescription implicit in this approach is , first , find the hamiltonian of the system , second , calculate the time evolution between a final state and an initial state , i.e. , between the final bra vector state @xmath6 , with metric @xmath7 on a spatial hypersurface @xmath8 at some generic prescribed time @xmath9 , and the initial ket vector state , @xmath10 , with metric @xmath11 on a spatial hypersurface @xmath12 at some generic prescribed time @xmath13 , and , third , euclideanize time . here , the amplitude to propagate to a configuration @xmath6 from a configuration @xmath10 , is represented by @xmath14 in the schrdinger picture .",
    "euclideanizing time , @xmath15 and summing over a complete orthonormal basis of configurations @xmath16 one obtains in general the partition function @xmath17 $ ] , of the field @xmath18 at a temperature @xmath19 and at some chemical potential @xmath3 , where @xmath20 is the eigenenergy of the eigenstate @xmath16 , and @xmath21 is the eigenvalue of some variable conjugate to @xmath3 , such as the particle number ( when @xmath3 is effectively the chemical potential ) , or the charge number ( when @xmath3 is the electric potential ) , for instance .",
    "this route is based on the hamiltonian methods for covariant gravity theories @xcite and for black hole spacetimes on the hamiltonian method of kucha @xcite .",
    "it was developed by louko and whiting in @xcite for the specific problem of finding black hole entropies and thermodynamic properties .",
    "indeed kuchar @xcite applied his procedure to the full vacuum schwarzschild black hole spacetime , which is really composed of a spherically symmetric white hole plus a black hole plus two asymptotically flat regions .",
    "these regions are well pictured in a carter - penrose diagram . by considering the spacelike foliations of the full manifold , the true dynamical degree of freedom of the phase space of the schwarzschild black hole",
    "was found .",
    "this degree of freedom , represented by one pair of canonical variables , is composed of the mass @xmath22 of the solution and its conjugate momentum , which physically represents the difference between the killing times at right and left spatial infinities .",
    "louko and whiting @xcite , by adapting the formalism to a spacelike foliation to the right of the future event horizon of the solution , and imposing appropriate boundary conditions , obtained the hamiltonian @xmath23 , the time evolution operator @xmath24 in the schrdinger picture , the associated partition function and finally the thermodynamics .",
    "this method has been applied for various theories of gravity , in several different dimensions , and in either asymptotically flat or asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "there are several applications of the formalism to four - dimensional spacetimes @xcite , now , it is clear that it is important to understand the physics in several different dimensions .",
    "indeed , hints from many places like string theory , ads / cft ( anti de sitter / conformal field theory ) conjecture , extra large dimensions and the connected braneworld scenarios , point out to the possibility of a world with other space dimensions . a first attempt to study the thermodynamics of a higher dimensional black hole using the hamiltonian approach was done for @xmath25 lovelock gravity @xcite . a related formalism developed in @xcite studied some higher dimensional black holes that admit a reduction to a two - dimensional dilaton - gravity theory .",
    "there are also incursions in the application of the formalism into lower dimensional dilaton - gravity theories , e.g. , in @xmath26 @xcite , and in @xmath27 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a connection between the hamiltonian formalism of @xcite and the path - integral formalism of @xcite is made .",
    "so here , we are interested in applying the hamiltonian formalism introduced by louko and whiting @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) , to the @xmath0-dimensional , @xmath28 , reissner - nordstrm black holes with spherical , planar , and hyperbolic horizon compact topology , and with a negative cosmological constant , i.e. , in an asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "spherically symmetric electrically charged black holes in @xmath0 dimensions are also known as tangherlini black holes @xcite , or simply @xmath0-dimensional reissner - nordstrm ads black holes , see also @xcite for the kerr the @xmath0-dimensional kerr black holes .",
    "planar toroidal compact black holes in four dimensions were discussed in @xcite and charged ones in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hyperbolic toroidal compact black holes in four dimensions were studied in @xcite , and the charged version of the three together in @xcite . in @xmath0 dimensions",
    "these topological black holes were analyzed in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the solution for kerr - ads black holes in @xmath0 dimensions was found in @xcite .",
    "one notes that if the cosmological constant is nonnegative , black holes with nonspherical topology do not exist .    to develop the hamiltonian formalism for these @xmath0-dimensional ads black holes",
    "an important issue one has to deal with is to find the asymptotic fall - off conditions at infinity . in four dimensions",
    "the problem was settled by henneaux and teitelboim @xcite , where through the precise asymptotic structure of the kerr - ads metric and acting on that structure with the four - dimensional ads group one was able to find the correct fall - off conditions .",
    "louko and winters - hilt @xcite used these fall - off conditions to study the four - dimensional reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole . in @xmath0 dimensions no such procedure is available ,",
    "although the kerr - ads metric solution in @xmath0 dimensions has already been found @xcite .",
    "thus , by following the same procedure as in @xcite one should be able to arrive at the correct fall - off conditions .",
    "fortunately , in our case the problem is much simpler and we can adapt with some care to @xmath0 dimensions the fall - off conditions of @xcite .",
    "then , after following other procedures , one finds the reduced hamiltonian , and a statistical analysis can finally be performed .",
    "we study the grand canonical ensemble and find a very general effective action @xmath4 , or equivalently , a very general partition function . from the action @xmath4 one",
    "can readily extract all the relevant thermodynamical information .",
    "we study the phase transitions of the system and the thermodynamic quantities , such as temperature and entropy , of the solution containing a black hole .",
    "the phase transitions are between hot flat space and black holes , two different sectors of the solution space , one with trivial topology , the other with black hole topology , respectively .",
    "these phase transitions show similarities with the bose - einstein condensation phenomenon .",
    "there are several particular results that can be obtained from our general action formula @xmath4 .",
    "first , within works using a hamiltonian thermodynamics formalism we recover the thermodynamics for spherically symmetric reissner - nordstrm - ads black holes in four dimensions ( @xmath29 ) @xcite , the thermodynamics for ads black holes with planar and hyperbolic topology in four dimensions ( @xmath29 ) @xcite , and the results for the spherical black hole in a finite box with radius @xmath30 ( when @xmath31 ) in a lovelock @xmath25 theory , which can also be called a gauss - bonnet theory , without a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "second , within works using an euclidean path integral method we also recover from our general action formula , when appropriate , the thermodynamics of the @xmath0-dimensional spherical reissner - nordstrm black hole studied in @xcite , as well as the thermodynamics of the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole studied in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we obtain the thermodynamics of the reissner - nordstrm - ads black holes in four dimensions ( @xmath29 ) with spherically symmetric studied in @xcite , which in turn recovers results found in @xcite and in @xcite , as well as the thermodynamics obtained in @xcite for the charged ads black holes in planar topology .",
    "the paper layout is thus the following : in sec .",
    "[ bh ] we write the ansatz for the black hole solutions of the charged black holes in @xmath0 dimensions with spherical , planar toroidal , and hyperbolic toroidal topology , plus the ansatz for the vector potential @xmath32 , following it with the metric and vector potential solutions for the @xmath0-dimensional black holes .",
    "the carter - penrose diagram of the charged black holes in @xmath0 dimensions with spherical , planar toroidal , and hyperbolic toroidal topology , is then depicted . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] , the adm form for the metric and @xmath32 are spelled out , the canonical description for the einstein - maxwell action in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions is done and is followed by the reconstruction of the action .",
    "after the canonical transformations , we reduce the hamiltonian to the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "there follows the canonical quantization through the schrdinger representation of the time evolution operator . in sec .",
    "[ thermo ] the thermodynamics is studied .",
    "first , there is the construction of the partition function for the grand canonical ensemble through the imposition of euclidean boundary conditions on the time evolution operator found previously .",
    "then , the critical points of the effective action in the partition function integral are obtained .",
    "next , the effective action is evaluated at the critical points , where , depending on the value of the effective action at these critical points , one can obtain hot flat space or a black hole through a phase transition .",
    "the results are compared to previous results .",
    "it is then possible to determine the expected values of the energy and charge , plus the entropy , from the saddle point approximation of the partition function of the ensemble . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "we choose @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 throughout .",
    "the electrically charged ads black hole solution can be generically written as ( see @xcite ) @xmath37 where we have @xmath28 , @xmath38 is the schwarzschild time coordinate , @xmath39 is the schwarzschild time coordinate , and @xmath40 is a function that yields horizons and thus black holes .",
    "its form depends on the theory , we will be interested in @xmath0-dimensional general relativity .",
    "the constant @xmath5 has values @xmath41 whether the topology is spherical , planar toroidal , or hyperbolic toroidal , all three being compact topologies .",
    "the angular part of the metric ( [ general_metric ] ) is , for each @xmath41 , @xmath42 in the spherical case , @xmath43 , one can take the range of coordinates as the usual one @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 . in the planar case , @xmath47 , the range is arbitrary , though finite for a compact surface , and we can choose @xmath45 . in the hyperbolic - compact surface case ,",
    "@xmath48 , the situation is in general more involved , and we need to choose a finite area surface for the black hole horizon in order to be able to study its thermodynamics .",
    "for example , in @xmath29 spacetime dimensions , the horizon is a 2-dimensional hyperbolic torus , i.e , a riemann surface with genus @xmath49 . for more details ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the vector potential one - form which is generically written as @xmath50 where the electric potential @xmath51 depends on the theory one is studying .",

    "usually one defines the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xmath66 , which in principle , for asymptotically well defined spacetimes is a well defined quantity .",
    "the black holes we study here are asymptotically ads and so have a well defined mass . however",
    ", depending on the values one gives for the cyclic coordinates of the torus , one gets different answers in the planar and hyperbolic toroidal cases , not so in the spherical case which has well defined angular coordinates .",
    "moreover , when performing our canonical analysis , as it will be done here , a mass which is the one necessary to make the important canonical transformations , and renders the expressions most simple , pops up .",
    "we call this mass the canonical mass @xmath22 .",
    "the relation between the canonical mass and the mass parameter is , as we will see , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the area of the @xmath54 unit surface .",
    "for instance , in the spherical case and for zero cosmological constant , one has @xmath69 , where now in the spherical case @xmath22 is also the adm mass , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the area of the @xmath54 unit sphere @xcite . the same applies for the electrical charge , although here the ambiguities are not as strong . here the canonical charge @xmath72 , i.e. , the one necessary to make the important canonical transformations , and the charge parameter are equal , @xmath73 .",
    "none of these is the adm ( gauss ) charge @xmath74 .",
    "for instance , in the spherical case and for zero cosmological constant , one has @xmath75 .",

    "in the subsequent developments we follow the basic formalism developed by kucha @xcite . the canonical coordinates are @xmath39 and @xmath81 , which are functions of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath82 .",
    "now , @xmath83 is generically on the horizon as analyzed in @xcite , but for our purposes @xmath83 represents the horizon bifurcation @xmath54-manifold of the carter - penrose diagram ( see , @xcite ) .",

    "the canonical coordinates @xmath82 and the lapse function @xmath85 are taken to be positive .",
    "the angular coordinates are left untouched , due to the symmetries assumed .",
    "the ansatz ( [ adm_ansatz ] ) is written in order to perform the foliation of spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces , and thus separates the spatial part of the spacetime from the temporal part .",
    "indeed , the canonical analysis requires the explicit separation of the time coordinate from the other space coordinates , and so in all expressions time is treated separately from the other coordinates .",
    "it breaks explicit covariance of the einstein - maxwell - ads theory , but it is necessary in order to perform the hamiltonian analysis .",
    "the metric coefficients of the induced metric on the hypersurfaces become the canonical variables , and the momenta are determined in the usual way , by replacing the time derivatives of the canonical variables , the velocities . then , using the hamiltonian one builds a time evolution operator to construct an appropriate thermodynamic ensemble for the geometries of a quantum theory of gravity .",

    "we can now write the action evaluated at the critical points , where also @xmath299 and @xmath3 are determined as functions of the critical pair @xmath346 .",
    "the full expression is @xmath347 where @xmath348 , see eq .",
    "( [ areal ] ) . expression ( [ eff_action_at_critpts ] ) is quite general .",
    "it can be compared with other studies that have chosen a particular dimension of spacetime , or a particular asymptotic regime , or a particular topology .",
    "for instance , for generic @xmath0 and @xmath43 one finds from ( [ eff_action_at_critpts ] ) an action for @xmath0-dimensional reissner - nordstrm black holes which was not explicitly shown in @xcite .",
    "if , for generic @xmath0 and @xmath43 , we further put @xmath349 one finds from ( [ eff_action_at_critpts ] ) the following action @xmath350 which is the action found in @xcite . in addition , by putting @xmath29 and @xmath43 into ( [ eff_action_at_critpts ] ) one finds @xmath351 which is the action first found in @xcite .",
    "if we further assume @xmath349 , one finds the hawking - page action @xmath352 @xcite . or",
    ", by putting @xmath29 and @xmath47 into ( [ eff_action_at_critpts ] ) one finds @xmath353 , which was found in @xcite .",
    "we defer a full comparison to the next subsection , after having studied the phase transitions of the system .",
    "now , the ensemble in this case has already been identified as the grand canonical , where @xmath354 ( or @xmath299 ) and @xmath3 are fixed .",
    "what now is needed is to obtain the most stable thermodynamic solutions for this ensemble . in order to do that",
    ", it is necessary to know the interval of the order parameter @xmath3 in which a given critical point is a global minimum , local minimum or none of the latter .",
    "each different minimum represents a physical system , such as hot flat space , for instance .",
    "note that , hot flat spaces and black holes , are two different sectors of the solution space , one with trivial topology , the other with black hole topology , respectively . to be definitive ,",
    "let us fix the temperature , or @xmath299 , on the boundary .",
    "now , @xmath3 is also fixed on the boundary , but we can fix it with any value we like .",
    "so , imagining changing the parameter @xmath3 , fixed on the boundary , one finds that , for instance , one local minimum may turn into a global minimum , signaling that a phase transition occurs at a certain value of @xmath3 .",
    "the saddle point approximation of the partition function ( [ partition_function_ren ] ) chooses the global minima of the critical points for each value of @xmath3 , on the understanding that @xmath299 is fixed . from eqs .",
    "( [ crit_r ] ) , ( [ crit_q ] ) , ( [ crit_r2 ] ) , and ( [ crit_q2 ] ) one finds the values of the critical points in terms of @xmath261 and @xmath267 .",
    "( [ crit_r2 ] ) and ( [ crit_q2 ] ) are at the origin of the @xmath322 , and do not depend on the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "( [ crit_r ] ) and ( [ crit_q ] ) will change in value as @xmath3 changes .",
    "the expression ( [ crit_q ] ) implies that once @xmath261 is determined for a critical point , @xmath267 is immediately given .",
    "so , on the plane @xmath322 , the critical points are found by the curve defined through ( [ crit_q ] ) , for each given @xmath3 .",
    "then , if we replace the value of the charge as a function of @xmath261 , i. e. , @xmath355 as given in ( [ crit_q ] ) , into the effective action ( [ eff_action ] ) we obtain a one variable function of @xmath261 , written as @xmath356 which is a function of @xmath261 .",
    "now , not all @xmath261 are solutions , i.e. , critical points , only those defined by ( [ crit_r ] ) belong to the solution manifold . choosing from those that belong to the solution manifold we are interested in solutions that minimize the effective action . in order to find out which is a minimum , for a given @xmath3 , and even which is the lowest minimum of them all",
    ", it suffices to analyze the one variable function given in ( [ eff_action_r ] ) .",
    "this function could have been written with respect to @xmath267 , thus allowing us to find the minima in @xmath267 .",
    "however , as we are dealing with a black hole whose entropy we also want to determine , and as the entropy is proportional to the horizon area , which is itself a function of @xmath261 , it is much more convenient to study the effective action as a function of @xmath261 .",
    "now , the first critical point is at @xmath357 . at this point",
    "the action ( [ eff_action_r ] ) is equal to zero , @xmath358 .",
    "this critical point is always there , as @xmath357 does not depend on any one parameter , except perhaps the dimension , which is considered here as @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 then @xmath357 is no longer a critical point , but for any other critical point to be a global minimum it will have to obey that @xmath359 .",
    "this is valid for all the other dimensions where @xmath357 is in fact a critical point . if @xmath360 , the critical point in question is not a global minimum .",
    "all this reasoning is valid when there are no two critical points such that @xmath359 . in the case of two critical points with @xmath359 , the one that gives the least value of ( [ eff_action_r ] ) is the global minimum .",
    "so the first step is finding the zeros of ( [ eff_action_r ] ) .",
    "not only do the zeros help finding the global minimum , but also they give the intervals for the order parameter @xmath3 for each different global minimum . in other words ,",
    "the zeros help discriminate the physical phases .",
    "the zeros of the effective action ( [ eff_action_r ] ) are given by @xmath361 the first zero , @xmath362 is independent of @xmath3 . in relation to the second zero ,",
    "there follow different conclusions , depending on the value of @xmath344 for @xmath363 . indeed",
    ", @xmath363 must respect @xmath364 so that at least a zero of the form of ( [ zeros_eff_action_r_2 ] ) exists .",
    "then , if @xmath365 were smaller than the right hand side of ( [ ineq_2 ] ) there would be no new zeros , besides @xmath366 .",
    "this would mean physically that there would be no black hole , and there would only be a heat bath with temperature @xmath367 ( see @xcite for the particular case of schwarzschild - ads ) .",
    "if the equality of ( [ ineq_2 ] ) holds , then we have a double zero at @xmath368 .",
    "this point is also a critical point , i.e. , it is a solution for the system .",
    "if we replace the equality in ( [ ineq_2 ] ) back in ( [ crit_r ] ) , we see that @xmath369 . here",
    "both @xmath370 and @xmath371 are global minima , so there is a degeneracy . here , there is an equal probability for the system to consist of a heat bath alone or a charged black hole of radius @xmath371 with thermal radiation .",
    "the equality in ( [ ineq_2 ] ) marks the threshold from which the critical point @xmath372 is a global minimum .",
    "once the inequality in ( [ ineq_2 ] ) holds , then @xmath372 is the only global minimum , ending the degeneracy , i.e. , @xmath373 .",
    "this implies the stable solution consists of a charged black hole of radius @xmath372 in equilibrium with a heat bath temperature @xmath367 .",
    "perhaps some other minor comments in relation to @xmath374 are in order .",
    "the other critical point @xmath374 is always less than @xmath372 , and the effective action ( [ eff_action_r ] ) is always positive at @xmath374 as long as @xmath375 .",
    "once @xmath376 , then both the critical point @xmath377 and @xmath378 . at the same time",
    "however , the action ( [ eff_action_r ] ) at @xmath374 is always larger than at @xmath374 , once there are two different critical points @xmath380 .",
    "if any critical point @xmath380 is less than zero , it has lost its physical meaningfulness .",
    "all the previous discussion is general , and applies directly to the spherical topology .",
    "however , if the topology is different , i.e. , @xmath343 , then the inequality in the expression ( [ ineq_2 ] ) holds always .",
    "this means that @xmath372 is always the global minimum .",
    "therefore the classical solution is found in the global minimum of the critical point @xmath340 of the effective action @xmath315 ( eq .",
    "( [ eff_action ] ) ) . differently from the spherical case ,",
    "there are no phase transitions , as discussed in @xcite .    for an illustration of the previous discussion ,",
    "a choice is made , namely , @xmath25 , @xmath43 , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 .",

    "this second set yields , as @xmath432 , a divergent @xmath429 and a divergent @xmath439 , and also leads to an entropy going to infinity as @xmath440 . in this limit the heat capacity and the thermal energy",
    "diverge too .",
    "as in the spherical case , these solutions , represent metastable black holes which can quantum tunnel into hot flat space and vice versa .",
    "since we have taken from the start that our box is ads infinity ( i.e. , @xmath422 at the outset ) , our boundary conditions do not recover these metastable solutions , and we will not discuss them anymore ( see @xcite for further analysis ) .",
    "the first set , which fixes @xmath261 and @xmath267 , is of our concern now . in @xcite , the temperature @xmath354 and electrostatic potential @xmath3 tend to zero as @xmath433 , and the energy tends to zero as well , @xmath441 .",
    "here we have fixed precisely the temperature at infinity ( following @xcite ) so that @xmath435 .",
    "but the difference between the two adjustments is merely one of choosing the zero point .",
    "after these remarks we can proceed , and by putting @xmath29 , @xmath47 into ( [ eff_action_at_critpts ] ) we find @xmath442 which was first found in @xcite .    the analysis displayed in ( a ) and ( b ) above , and the comparisons made ,",
    "show that the new action , eq .",
    "( [ eff_action ] ) , for general @xmath0 and arbitrary topologies recovers previous results in the appropriate limits .",
    "the partition function @xmath320 can now be written , for @xmath443 , through the saddle - point approximation @xmath444\\,,\\\\       \\ln\\mathcal{z}_{\\textrm{ren}}(\\beta,\\phi ) & \\approx & \\ln\\textrm{p }       -i_*(r_{\\textrm{h}}^+,\\textbf{q}^+)\\ , .",
    "\\label{log_z_approx } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath445 is a slowly varying prefactor , and @xmath446 is the effective action evaluated at the global minimum critical point . by ignoring the prefactor s logarithm , which closer to @xmath340 is less relevant , we are able to determine the value of @xmath266 at the critical point , where we find that it corresponds to the value of the mass of the classical solution of the black hole given in eqs .",
    "( [ general_metric])-([general_f ] ) .",
    "thus , when the critical point dominates the partition function , we have that the mean energy @xmath447 is given by @xmath448 where @xmath449 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ m_r_h ] ) evaluated at @xmath340 .",
    "the thermal expectation value of the charge is @xmath450 as given in eq .",
    "( [ crit_q ] ) .",
    "we also can write the temperature @xmath451 as a function of the critical point @xmath452 and the electric charge @xmath453 @xmath454 with @xmath452 explicitly written in ( [ crit_r ] ) , and where @xmath453 is given in in eq .",
    "( [ crit_q ] ) . if we replace the value of the charge of the extreme black hole solution , which is given in @xmath455 , the maximum the charge can attain inside the domain of integration of the partition function , into the expression for the temperature , eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) , then we get a null temperature . it can be shown that @xmath456 , which through the constant @xmath3 heat capacity @xmath457 tells us that the system is thermodynamically stable .    finally there is the entropy of the black hole , @xmath458 , which is given by @xmath459 we see that the extreme black hole , despite having null temperature , has an entropy proportional to its horizon area .",
    "from a hamiltonian thermodynamics formalism we have found a quite general effective action ( [ eff_action_at_critpts ] ) valid for charged higher dimensional @xmath28 ads ( negative cosmological constant ) spacetimes , with spherical , planar , and hyperbolic topologies .",
    "there are black hole as well as hot flat spacetime solutions .",
    "it was shown that the phase transitions , already present for the reissner - nordstrm ads black hole in four dimensions , show up again for the generic @xmath0-dimensional charged case . in these phase transitions a black hole turns into hot flat space and vice - versa . however",
    ", this phase transition does not happen for nonspherical topologies .",
    "we have also calculated the entropy of these higher dimensional charged ads black holes .",
    "this entropy is given by a quarter of the horizon area for any topology considered .",
    "it is thus obtained that the entropy relation with the quarter of the horizon area is kept for arbitrary higher dimensions , and that the topology does not affect the relation .",
    "since the hamiltonian formalism yields a correct consistent expression for the entropy of a black hole , we have proved that the formalism has a wide applicability , both to higher dimensions and to nonspherical topologies .",
    "these results may be of value for investigations on ads / cft physics .",
