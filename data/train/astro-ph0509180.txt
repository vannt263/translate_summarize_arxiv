    "among the outstanding characteristics of be stars are their phase transitions evidenced by the balmer line emission intensity changes . these changes can be ought either to variations of the physical structure and size of a more or less permanent circumstellar envelope ( ce ) , or to the creation of a new ce during mass ejection events that undergo the central star .",
    "some keys on the ce formation can be obtained from the time scales of their emission line variation , which can be related directly with the disc formation . in this contribution",
    "we present the cyclic long - term h@xmath0 line emission changes observed in @xmath0  eri .",
    "we collected in the literature the spectroscopic and photometric records of the h@xmath0 line variation and studied them as a function of time .",
    "we also take advantage of new observations of the @xmath0  eri h@xmath0 line emission changes , to derive information on time scales that characterize complete transitions .",
    "the time scales of these cycles matter to understand the disc formation mechanisms ( porter 1999 , okazaki 2001 ) .    if the evolution of the ce in @xmath0  eri , i.e. formation and subsequent dissipation , has to be understood in terms of a viscous decretion disc model ( porter 1999 , okazaki 2001 ) , from the expected average viscous time scales @xmath1 days ( clark et al .",
    "2003 ) we would derive two different series of values of the viscosity coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "the time scales implied by the ce formation , 2 years roughly , we would obtain @xmath2 0.08 which is of the same order as expected for ce envelopes studied by clark et al .",
    "the time required by the decrease from maximum to zero is either 10 years in the 1974 - 1989 cycle or 6 years during the 1991 - 2000 cycle .",
    "this imply @xmath3 which is about 4 times smaller than implied in the formation process .",
    "we may then wonder whether the bulk redistribution of material in the circumstellar disc occurs only as a consequence of a viscous redistribution of angular momentum .",
    "the long - term h@xmath0 line emission variation in @xmath0  eri has a long - term , roughly cyclical  phase transitions every 14 - 15 years .",
    "the disc formation time scale , i.e. period when the h@xmath0 line emission increases from zero to its maximum , agrees with the viscous decretion model . on the other hand , the time required for the disc dissipation ranges from 6 to 12 years , which may question the viscous disc model .",
