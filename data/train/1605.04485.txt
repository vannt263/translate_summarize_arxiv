    "the fundamental description of dynamically arrested states of matter is a crucial step towards understanding the properties of very common amorphous solid materials such as glasses and gels @xcite , and of more technologically specialized materials , such as spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the main fundamental challenge posed by these materials derives from their inability to reach thermodynamic equilibrium within experimental times , and from the fact that their properties depend on the protocol of preparation , in obvious contrast with materials that have genuinely attained thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "understanding the origin of this behaviour falls outside the realm of classical and statistical thermodynamics , and must unavoidably be addressed from the perspective of a non - equilibrium theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , a major challenge for statistical physics is to develop a microscopic theory able to predict the properties of glasses and gels in terms not only of the intermolecular forces and applied external fields , but also in terms of the protocol of preparation of the material .    _ first - principles _ theoretical frameworks exist , leading to _ quantitative _ predictions of the dynamic properties of structural glass forming liquids near their dynamical arrest transitions , one of the best - known being mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite .",
    "however , this theory , as well as the equilibrium version of the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of dynamical arrest @xcite , are meant to describe the dynamics of _ fully equilibrated _ liquids .",
    "hence , the phenomenology of the transient time - dependent processes , such as aging , occurring during the amorphous solidification of structural glass formers , falls completely out of the scope of these _ equilibrium _ theories .",
    "thus , it is important to attempt their extension to describe these non - stationary non - equilibrium structural relaxation processes , which in the end constitute the most fundamental kinetic fingerprint of glassy behavior .    in an attempt to face this challenge , in 2000 latz @xcite proposed a formal non - equilibrium extension of mct which",
    ", however , has not yet found a specific quantitative application . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the scgle theory has recently been extended to describe non - stationary non - equilibrium processes in glass - forming liquids @xcite .",
    "the resulting non - equilibrium theory , referred to as the _ non - equilibrium _ self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( ne - scgle ) theory , was derived within the fundamental framework provided by a non - stationary extension @xcite of onsager s theory of linear irreversible thermodynamics @xcite and of time - dependent thermal fluctuations @xcite , with an adequate extension @xcite to allow for the description of memory effects .",
    "the ne - scgle theory thus derived , aimed at describing non - equilibrium relaxation phenomena in general @xcite , leads in particular @xcite to a simple and intuitive but generic description of the essential behavior of the non - stationary and non - equilibrium structural relaxation of glass - forming liquids near and beyond its dynamical arrest transition .",
    "this was explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a model liquid of soft - sphere particles .",
    "the recent comparison @xcite of the predicted scenario with systematic simulation experiments of the equilibration and aging of dense hard - sphere liquids , indicates that the accuracy of these predictions go far beyond the purely qualitative level , thus demonstrating that the ne - scgle theory is a successful pioneering first - principles statistical mechanical approach to the description of these fully non - equilibrium phenomena .    as an additional confirmation ,",
    "let us mention that for model liquids with hard - sphere plus attractive interactions , the ne - scgle theory predicts a still richer and more complex scenario , involving the formation of gels and porous glasses by arrested spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "as we know , quenching a liquid from supercritical temperatures to a state point inside its gas - liquid spinodal region , normally leads to the full phase separation through a process that starts with the amplification of spatial density fluctuations of certain specific wave - lengths @xcite . under some conditions",
    ", however , this process may be interrupted when the denser phase solidifies as an amorphous sponge - like non - equilibrium bicontinuous structure @xcite , typical of physical gels @xcite .",
    "this process is referred to as _ arrested _ spinodal decomposition , and has been observed in many colloidal systems , including colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite , mixtures of equally - sized oppositely - charged colloids @xcite , lysozyme protein solutions @xcite , mono- and bi - component suspensions of colloids with dna - mediated attractions @xcite , and thermosensitive nanoemulsions @xcite . from the theoretical side",
    ", it was not clear how to extend the classical theory of spinodal decomposition @xcite to include the possibility of dynamic arrest , or how to incorporate the characteristic non - stationarity of spinodal decomposition , in existing theories of glassy behavior @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite it has been shown that the ne - scgle theory provides precisely this missing unifying theoretical framework .",
    "recently the ne - scgle theory was extended to multi - component systems @xcite , thus opening the route to the description of more complex non - equilibrium amorphous states of matter . until now",
    ", however , the ne - scgle theory faces the limitation of referring only to liquids of particles with radially symmetric pairwise interparticle forces , thus excluding its direct comparison with the results of important real and simulated experiments involving intrinsically non - spherical particles @xcite and , in general , particles with non - radially symmetric interactions .",
    "the present work constitutes a first step in the direction of extending the ne - scgle theory to describe the irreversible evolution of the static and dynamic properties of a brownian liquid constituted by particles with non - radially symmetric interactions , in which the orientational degrees of freedom are essential .",
    "more concretely , the main purpose of the present paper is to describe the theoretical derivation of the ne - scgle time - evolution equations for the spherical harmonics projections @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , of the non - equilibrium and non - stationary static structure factor @xmath13 and of the collective and self intermediate scattering functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for this",
    ", we start from the same general and fundamental framework provided by the non - stationary extension of onsager s theory , developed in ref .",

    "( [ relsigmadifnonspher13])-([flmsqframenonstats ] ) below , in which @xmath8 is the delay time , and @xmath9 is the evolution ( or `` waiting '' ) time after the occurrence of the instantaneous temperature quench . the solution of these equations describe the non - equilibrium ( translational and rotational ) diffusive processes occurring in a colloidal dispersion after an instantaneous temperature quench , with the most interesting prediction being the aging processes that occur when full equilibration is prevented by conditions of dynamic arrest .",
    "although this paper only focuses on the theoretical derivation of the ne - scgle equations , as an illustration of the possible concrete applications of the extended non - equilibrium theory , here we also solve the resulting equations for one particular system and condition .",
    "we refer to a liquid of dipolar hard - spheres ( dhs ) with fixed positions and subjected to a sudden temperature quench .",
    "this is a simple model of the irreversible evolution of the collective orientational degrees of freedom of a system of strongly interacting magnetic dipoles with fixed but random positions . although this particular application by itself has its own intrinsic relevance in the context of disordered magnetic materials , the main reason to choose it as the illustrative example is that eqs .",

    "spherical particles , the development of the ne - scgle theory for liquids of non - spherical particles requires the previous development of the _ equilibrium _ version of the corresponding scgle theory . such an equilibrium scgle theory for non - spherical particles , however , was previously developed by elizondo - aguilera et al .",
    "@xcite , following to a large extent the work of schilling and collaborators @xcite on the extension of mode coupling theory for this class of systems .",

    "<S> the non - equilibrium self - consistent generalized langevin equation theory of irreversible processes in liquids is extended to describe the positional and orientational thermal fluctuations of the instantaneous local concentration profile @xmath0 of a suddenly - quenched colloidal liquid of particles interacting through non spherically - symmetric pairwise interactions , whose mean value @xmath1 is constrained to remain uniform and isotropic , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such self - consistent theory is cast in terms of the time - evolution equation of the covariance @xmath3 of the fluctuations @xmath4 of the spherical harmonics projections @xmath5 of the fourier transform of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theory describes the non - equilibrium evolution after a sudden temperature quench of both , the static structure factor projections @xmath6 and the two - time correlation function @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the correlation _ delay _ time and @xmath9 is the _ evolution _ or _ waiting _ time after the quench . as a concrete and illustrative application we use the resulting self - consistent equations to describe the irreversible processes of equilibration or aging of the orientational degrees of freedom of a system of strongly interacting classical dipoles with quenched positional disorder . </S>"
