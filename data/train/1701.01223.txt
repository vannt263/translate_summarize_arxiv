    "how gossip spreads in a small community , how a political leader reaches or fails to reach voters , and how some students learn faster than others among those with comparable intellectual capacity are three questions that fall into the study of social opinion dynamics .",
    "it is no surprise that the research question has attracted the attention of many disciplines in a short span of time and a sizable penetrating literature has been accumulated .",
    "we refer to the survey papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for only a partial panorama .",
    "these publications can roughly be divided into those that take a bayesian perspective such as @xcite and those that put forward non - bayesian models such as @xcite . yet",
    "another classification is that while most of the research focuses on formation of a consensus @xcite , there are also those that study disagreement as in the case of hegselmann and krause model @xcite , @xcite or as in @xcite .",
    "the study of consensus has several engineering applications including multi - agent coordination @xcite , information fusion in sensor networks @xcite , consensus in small - world networks @xcite and distributed optimization algorithms @xcite .",
    "we study consensus formation via nash equilibrium in a dynamic game of a prescribed duration played by members in a social network .",
    "each member ( player or agent ) independently minimizes a cost function that represents  its \" ( can be read as  his / her \" ) motive .",
    "an integral cost function penalizes its differences of opinion from its neighbors as well as from its own initial opinion , weighted by influence and stubbornness parameters .",
    "each member uses its rate of change of opinion as a control input .",
    "this defines a dynamic non - cooperative game that turns out to have a unique nash equilibrium . for two representative cases obtained by suitable assumptions on the information structure ( graph topology ) , we are able to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the opinion trajectories of all members in the nash solution .",
    "these trajectories are then examined under different assumptions on the relative sizes of influence and stubbornness parameters .",
    "nash equilibrium is only one among a wide range of equilibrium concepts in games .",
    "one interpretation in @xcite suggests that if the same game is played several times with no strategic dependencies between consecutive plays , then a nash equilibrium is most likely reached .",
    "this is for static games but one can extend the interpretation to dynamic games as well .",
    "the point of the matter is that it is a very useful construct ( and presently the only rigorous one ) if the research objective is to examine under what conditions , from independent motives of agents , a pattern of collective behavior emerges .    in @xcite ,",
    "a static game of opinion dynamics is posed and the best response function in a nash solution is used to postulate an update scheme .",
    "the convergence of this dynamic scheme to a consensus is examined .",
    "one can view our game model here as a dynamic version of @xcite .",
    "the optimal control of consensus model and control through a leader model in @xcite also use integral cost functions and has similarities to our model except that the objective in their case is control of consensus via external actions .",
    "the non - cooperative dynamic game model here is inspired by the foraging biological swarm models in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we pose the opinion dynamics game in its most generality . in section 3",
    ", we study two specialized versions and obtain explicit nash solutions for these two games that represent extreme cases of information structure .",
    "section 4 contains a number of simulation results for the games of section 2 and 3 .",
    "the last section is on conclusions .",
    "we represent a social network of @xmath0 agents by a weighted directed graph @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the set of all nodes ( agents ) , @xmath3 is the set of all ordered pairs of connected nodes , and @xmath4 is the influence of agent @xmath5 on agent @xmath6 when @xmath7 .",
    "one - sided or two - sided connection between the nodes indicate one - sided or two - sided interaction between the agents . the neighborhood of agent @xmath6 is defined to be the set of all agents with whom agent @xmath6 interacts , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the reason for a directed graph representation is because we can interpret the weight on the edges to be the influence of an agent on its neighbor or the value its neighbor gives to the opinion of an agent .",
    "thus , two neighbors can have different levels of influence on each other .",
    "let @xmath9 be the opinion at time @xmath10 of agent @xmath6 and let it be normalized so that for every @xmath10 in the interval @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "each agent has an initial opinion @xmath13 $ ] about a certain issue , where the values @xmath14 and @xmath15 indicate the extreme cases .",
    "for example , @xmath14 may be interpreted as strong disagreement and @xmath15 as strong agreement cases .",
    "let @xmath16'\\in [ 0,1]^n$ ] denote the opinion profile at time @xmath10 in the network of @xmath0 agents , where ` prime ' denotes transpose .",
    "the cost functional of agent @xmath6 is postulated to be @xmath17 ^ 2 \\\\",
    "+ \\frac{1}{2 } k_i \\left[x^i(t)-x^i(0 ) \\right]^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left[u^i(t)\\right]^2 \\biggr ) dt,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the parameter that weighs the susceptibility of agent @xmath5 to influence agent @xmath6 , @xmath19 weighs the stubbornness of agent @xmath6 or the reluctance of @xmath6 to divert from its initial opinion .",
    "the control of agent @xmath6 is assumed to be @xmath20 , so that agent @xmath6 controls the rate of change of its opinion .",
    "the coefficient of the control term in the cost is normalized to @xmath15 , without loss of generality .",
    "the integral in the time interval @xmath11 $ ] indicates that the agent penalizes the cumulative effect in each of the three terms in the integrand .",
    "considering the first term , for instance , what it penalizes as part of the cost is the sum total of the divergence from the opinions of the neighbors , not the instantaneous differences from their opinions .",
    "this cost functional , which should be viewed to be a model of the motive of agent @xmath6 towards a prevailing social issue , is prompted by @xcite , in which a static model for the motives of agents in a social network was used and by @xcite , in which a similar cost functional modeled the motives of members in a foraging biological swarm .",
    "if each agent in the social network minimizes its cost , then we have a non - cooperative dynamic ( or , differential ) game played by @xmath0 agents @xmath21 a solution to such a game , if it exists , is a _",
    "nash solution _ , or a _ nash equilibrium _ of the game .",
    "note that although @xmath22 is specified as @xmath23^n$ ] , its final value @xmath24 is left free .",
    "thus , the optimization each agent carries out is one of _ free terminal condition _ , @xcite .",
    "the game ( [ game ] ) lies within the framework of theorem 6.11 in @xcite and is in fact a quadratic game as we show in the appendix so that a unique nash equilibrium exists by theorem 6.12 of @xcite .",
    "instead of using this result ( after transforming the problem to the set up of @xcite ) , it is easier to use the necessary conditions provided by theorem 6.11 of @xcite .",
    "we thus state those necessary conditions in the set up of our game ( [ game ] ) first .",

    "however , if we assume that followers-1 are more loyal to their leader and they run a good campaign in order to attract the followers-10 , then they are able to steal followers-10 from their leader . for fig .",
    "3(c ) , we increase the influence of leader-1 to 20 and the cross impact of followers-1 on followers-10 to 10 , while all other parameters are the same .",
    "it can be seen that rather than following leader-10 , followers-10 tend to follow followers-1 due to social impact .",
    "the main conclusion of this study is that a consensus , nash equilibrium , can spontaneously be reached from independent motives of agents in a social network in the long run .",
    "how unanimous this consensus is depends on the initial differences of opinion , on the susceptibility of agents to influence , and on the stubbornness of agents .",
    "if one member is singled out as a leader who firmly sticks to its opinion , then a consensus about the leader s opinion is again formed in the long run . if an opinion game is played in a finite interval a full consensus is never reached in the presence of stubborn members .",
    "the game with leader can also be viewed as a game of learning in which the leader is the teacher and the others , students . here , it may be more instructive to examine the situation when learning is poorly achieved .",
    "it is clear that initial ignorance of the subject and reluctance to learn , all contribute to this .",
    "but , a low willingness to update is also a negative factor .",
    "the game studied can be extended in several directions .",
    "the opinion on a single issue is not essential and one can consider each agent having opinions on several issues as e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the technicality such an extension requires is that @xmath9 is no longer a scalar but a vector with each entry representing the level of opinion on one issue .",
    "one can also extend the game considered here to a network in which agents can have different  types \" of motives .",
    "then , the integrands of the cost functions the agents use will not have a uniform structure , e.g. , non - quadratic cost functions may be employed along with quadratic ones .",

    "this is the approach used in this appendix .",
    "the uniqueness of a nash solution when one exists is , however , a direct consequence of the above transformation and will not be separately addressed .",
