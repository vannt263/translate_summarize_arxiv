    "the landauer - buttiker approach to mesoscopic physics is rather novel .",
    "one of the great success of this approach is the landauer - buttiker conductance formula . to understand this approach further and the key to generalize",
    "this approach is the friedel sum rule ( fsr ) .",
    "it has been the subject of much study recently . while exact proofs can be given for bulk samples @xcite , in low dimensional systems some attempts to derive it ignore the effects of the leads @xcite .",
    "buttiker and his co - workers , emphasize the effects of the leads and find a correction term to the fsr @xcite .",
    "they state that leads can result in non - conservation of charge in quantum regimes and in such regimes fsr will break down .",
    "when the system is in the wkb limit , then charge is conserved and fsr works very well .",
    "recent explicit calculations @xcite for an impurity in a quantum wire contradicted this result .",
    "a single attractive impurity in a quantum wire can produce many resonant states that can all be classified as fano resonances @xcite .",
    "such an impurity in a quantum wire has attracted many theoretical investigation @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that the friedel sum rule is exact at the fano resonance which is a pure quantum interference phenomenon ( and not a wkb regime ) , and very bad in the regimes away from the fano resonance ( that are in the wkb regime ) .",
    "@xcite shows that other semi - classical formulas like the wigner delay time ( wdt ) also become exact at the fano resonance .",
    "an analysis of charge conservation and the origin of semiclassical behavior in a quantum regime is missing in refs . @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that there is no connection between charge conservation and validity of fsr in the sense that fsr can be violated even when charge is conserved .",
    "we shall also show that although such an impurity in a quantum wire give strong back scattering that is quantum mechanical in nature , such scattering do not disperse a wave packet .",
    "we shall also show that this explains why semi - classical theories are exact in a purely quantum mechanical regime .",
    "when one considers transport in mesoscopic systems then one typically considers a system as shown in fig 1 .",
    "the system between the points a and b is a grand canonical system coupled to reservoirs .",
    "the way we study grand canonical systems in text books is that the reservoir hamiltonian and the system hamiltonian can be decoupled .",
    "this allows one to construct a grand canonical partition function .",
    "but mesoscopic samples are so small that the actual modeling of the coupling to the reservoirs is necessary @xcite . the leads ( here we show only two leads but there can be many ) are ideal wires that connect the system to the reservoirs .",
    "they inject and absorb electrons and also define the correct boundary conditions for the system .",
    "the region between a and b is an elastic scatterer",
    ". a particle injected by reservoir 1 will freely propagate along lead 1 and will be incident on the scatterer between a and b. the reflected part will be absorbed by reservoir 1 and the transmitted part will be absorbed by reservoir 2 .",
    "the absorbed electrons are completely thermalized inside the reservoirs and their coherence is destroyed .",
    "phase shifts are defined with respect to points a and b and not with respect to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "density of states ( dos ) is also the local density of states ( ldos ) integrated between the points a and b @xcite .",
    "the scattering problem is completely defined with the points a and b @xcite provided the total charge in the region between a and b ( or the integrated ldos in the region between a and b ) is conserved .",
    "the region outside that can be parametrized with chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) and temperature ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the same for the two reservoirs , then we get an equilibrium situation , and if they are different then we get non - equilibrium situation",
    ". all this will become explicit in our model calculation .",
    "as a simple realization of such a system ( as shown in fig .",

    "the free regions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the leads . for a symmetric scatterer in 1d ,",
    "the scattering matrix is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the reflection amplitude and @xmath2 is the transmission amplitude of the scatterer .    if we consider a two channel quantum wire with a delta function potential .",
    "the scattering matrix will be 4x4 as shown below . @xmath9\\ ] ] we are using a notation that @xmath10 as it is a reflection amplitude for an electron incident along the first transverse mode from the left lead and scattered back to the first transverse mode in the left lead .",

    "similarly , @xmath12 as it is a transmission amplitude for an electron incident along the first transverse mode from the left lead and scattered forward to the first transverse mode in the right lead .",
    "one can easily understand the rest .",
    "one can solve the scattering problem to find that for @xmath13 and @xmath14 taking values 1 or 2 , @xmath15 if @xmath16 then @xmath17 if @xmath18 then @xmath19 here @xmath20   sin[{\\beta \\pi \\over w } ( y_j+w/2)]\\ ] ] @xmath21 @xmath22   sin[{\\nu \\pi \\over w } ( y_j+w/2)]\\ ] ] @xmath23 can take any integer value greater than 2 ( i.e. , @xmath23=3,4,5 , ... ) .",

    "one can define the points a and b as the cut off points beyond which the localized charge has decayed to negligible values .",
    "also in real systems @xmath23 will have some cut off that can have several physical origins like decoherence or work function of the quantum wire .",
    "the @xmath13th injectivity at a point @xmath35 is due to the incident electron of velocity @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is defined as @xmath38 where , @xmath39 is plank s constant , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is incident wave vector , @xmath27 is particle mass , @xmath42 represents coordinate and @xmath43 is quantum mechanical wave function due to unit current incident in the @xmath13th channel .",

    "13 is its universality . at any resonance ( or quasi bound state ) @xmath53 $ ] change by unity and hence @xmath54 will change by @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 can be determined from asymptotic wave function ( @xmath57 ) and so one can completely avoid integrating the ldos to find the dos .",
    "the purpose of this section is to explain the discrepancy observed in ref .",
    "@xcite about the fsr .",
    "namely the fsr becomes exact in a purely quantum regime like the fano regime and bad away from the fano regime .",
    "according to our previous understanding , it should have been the opposite .",
    "such an explanation requires a detailed analysis of charge conservation and quantum behavior as follows .",
    "a physical origin of such a behavior will become clear in the next section .    to understand where fsr may go wrong ,",
    "we first inspect a derivation of the fsr @xcite .",
    "we present it for 1d as the steps can be repeated for q1d .",
    "suppose there is an extended potential @xmath58 ( to be dimensionally correct in the subsequent analysis , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is electronic charge ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath61 is analytic , we can make an expansion as @xmath62 @xmath63   + ..... \\ ] ] essentially this means breaking up the increment @xmath64 ( although an infinitesimal perturbation , it is an extended potential ) into many local increments @xmath65 and integrating the effect of all these local increments .",
    "@xmath65 is therefore a delta function potential at @xmath66 . now without any loss of generality , we can say that @xmath67 for all @xmath68 .",
    "in other words @xmath64 is a constant potential . since @xmath67 for all @xmath68 ,",
    "the local perturbation @xmath65 is also equal to @xmath69 , numerically .",
    "one has to remember that the two perturbations @xmath67 and @xmath70 are actually different .",
    "one of them is a global perturbation or an extended perturbation while the latter is a local perturbation .",
    "however , for @xmath71 , one can neglect this difference between them to write @xmath72 @xmath73\\ ] ] note that now we have an approximate equality and this can be further justified by explicit calculations as shown below .",
    "now one may propose that instead of increasing the potential everywhere by an infinitesimal amount @xmath69 , one may keep the potential constant and instead decrease the incident energy by @xmath74 .",
    "thus @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77\\ ] ]    one can prove that @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the pldos .",
    "pdos is therefore @xmath80 .",
    "one can take any potential in 1d and check that this equation is exact as done in ref .",
    "therefore , from eqs .",
    "17 and 18 , @xmath81 this on summing over @xmath13 and @xmath14 and further simplification gives @xmath82 ) \\approx \\pi[\\rho(e ) - \\rho_0(e)]\\ ] ] thus we have derived fsr .",
    "replacing @xmath83 by -@xmath84 is an approximation .",
    "thus , @xmath56 is not exactly equal to @xmath85 $ ] and so naturally one can expect that @xmath56 is also not exactly equal to @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "in fact @xcite , @xmath87   - im(r_{ll } + r_{rr})/4e\\ ] ] we have used suffixes ` @xmath88 ' and ` @xmath89 ' , instead of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the reasons are obvious as @xmath90 is for the electrons incident from the left and reflected back to the left lead , while @xmath91 is for the electrons incident from the right and reflected back to the right lead .",
    "one may consider eq .",
    "21 as a new fsr but the correction term @xmath92 $ ] is not very universal .",
    "it can be different for different kinds of resonances .",
    "secondly , in quasi 1d we will see that this correction term will also depend on internal details of the potential and can vary from sample to sample .",
    "so the correction term is @xmath93 .",
    "@xcite and others assume that this term is due to the non - conservation of charge in the system .",
    "they assume ( see eqs .",
    "11 and 12 in ref @xcite ) that this term can be related to self energy due to the escape probability of an electron in to the leads .",
    "so according to @xcite , in quantum regimes , this term can be large .",
    "an essential component of this work is to establish that this correction term is not due to non - conservation of charge .",
    "although in 1d , 2d and 3d the correction term is large when the escape probability to the leads is large ( that is charge is not conserved in the grand canonical system ) and vice versa , this is not true in q1d .",
    "we show below that the correction term can be large in q1d even when charge is conserved and also the correction term can be zero in the fano regime which is a quantum regime .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that @xmath94 -[\\rho^{gc}(e ) - \\rho^{gc}_0(e)]=\\ ] ] @xmath95 \\over k}(r_{ll}+r_{rr } ) + { cos[2kl ] \\over k}(ir_{ll } - ir_{rr})\\ ] ] this has two implications .",
    "first is that since @xmath96 - im(r_{ll } + r_{rr})/4e \\ne \\pi [ ( \\rho(e ) - \\rho_0(e)]$ ] , it follows from eq .",
    "21 that @xmath97\\ ] ] it can only be an approximate equality as shown before .",
    "the second implication is that the correction term @xmath98 is not due to the lack of charge conservation .",
    "this is explained below .",
    "when we integrate over all energy then we get that the rhs of eq .",
    "22 goes as @xmath99 .",
    "the global charge has to be conserved , implying @xmath100=0 $ ] . hence from eq .",
    "22 , @xmath101 $ ] goes as @xmath99 . since only positive energy states are propagating states that we are interested in",
    ", one can always take the integration over @xmath32 in the positive energy regime instead of taking it from @xmath102 to @xmath103 . as @xmath104 is a non - propagating state , in the propagating regime @xmath105$]=0 .",
    "so charge is conserved in the grand canonical system .",
    "so the correction term in eq .",
    "21 is arising due to the error involved in the substitution in eq .",
    "17 and has nothing to do with charge conservation .",
    "it is just an error due to an approximation in the algebra .",
    "although in the appendix we have considered a 1d system , all the steps can be repeated for a single channel q1d system .",
    "only the expressions for @xmath90 and @xmath91 will be different and @xmath106 .",
    "so for a single channel quantum wire , @xmath107 - im{r_{ll}+r_{rr } \\over 4(e - e_1)}\\ ] ] first of all note the presence of sample specific parameter @xmath108 in the correction term that was ignored in ref .",
    "this equation is the same whether evanescent modes are present or not present .",
    "however , only the expressions for @xmath90 and @xmath91 changes completely in presence and absence of evanescent modes . from eq",
    ". 3 @xmath109={{\\gamma_{11 } \\over k_1 } ( 1+\\sum_{n>1 } { \\gamma_{\\nu \\nu } \\over 2 \\kappa_\\nu } ) \\over ( 1+\\sum_{n>1 } { \\gamma_{\\nu \\nu}\\over 2 \\kappa_\\nu})^2 + ( { \\gamma_{11 } \\over 2k_1})^2}\\ ] ] for a delta function potential in 1d , @xmath109={{\\gamma_{1d } \\over k_1 }   \\over 1 + ( { \\gamma_{1d } \\over 2k_1})^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 . in comparison with the 1d case , the only difference in quasi one dimension ( q1d ) ( compare eqs .",
    "25 and 26 ) is the term @xmath111 if we remove this term then the correction term is negligible for @xmath112 which is the semi - classical regime .",
    "complications in q1d arise because of the series term @xmath113 .",
    "even for @xmath114 , @xmath115 can become zero and then the correction term can become 0 in a purely quantum regime . at the fano resonance",
    "this is exactly what happens , i.e. , rhs of eq .",
    "25 becomes 0 precisely due to the fact that @xmath115=0 at the fano resonance ( see eq . 9 ) . also note that although each term in the series decreases with energy , the sum does not decrease easily as the series is a divergent series .",
    "it goes as @xmath116 $ ] where @xmath117 is the total number of terms in the series or the total number of evanescent modes @xcite .",
    "one can make the transverse width @xmath118 to create an infinite number of evanescent modes and then one can see from eq .",
    "25 that the correction term goes to zero implying that fsr is exact in 2d . in real quantum wires",
    ", we have to truncate the series at some value @xmath117 .",
    "for any arbitrary number of evanescent modes , the correction term can be as large as @xmath119 or @xmath120 $ ] , making the two qualitatively and quantitatively different , except in a narrow energy regime close to the upper band edge . at the upper band edge @xmath121",
    "diverge as the first term in it ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) diverges and hence rhs of eq .",
    "25 becomes 0 .",
    "the fact that fsr becomes exact at the fano resonance is very counterintuitive .",
    "fsr is similar to wdt and so it was also checked that wdt at the fano resonance becomes exact @xcite . the similarity between wdt and fsr",
    "can be seen from eqs .",
    "19 and 20 .",
    "@xmath123 = \\ ] ] @xmath124 = \\sum_{\\alpha \\beta } \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\rho_{\\alpha \\beta}(x ) dx\\ ] ] @xmath125 is the wdt for particles transmitted from the @xmath13th channel to the @xmath14th channel and there are @xmath126 of such particles",
    ". one can choose @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 \\over   re[s_{\\alpha \\beta}}]$ ] .",
    "we have also seen that the lhs in eq .",
    "28 is the semi - classical limit of the lhs of eq .",
    "18 integrated over @xmath66 .",
    "so in the semi - classical limit , wdt times the number of particles involved gives the pdos .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that in the fano regime also the wdt ( @xmath129 ) gives the pdos ( @xmath130 ) exactly , in spite the fact that fano resonance is a quantum phenomenon .",
    "this happens for single channel quantum wires as well as for multi channel quantum wires . another way to see that the wdt is semi - classical is that its derivation is based on non - dispersive wave - packets .",
    "below we show how non - dispersive wave - packets are realized in the quantum regime of fano resonance and as a result wdt becomes exact ( that is wdt gives the pdos correctly ) .",
    "we start by presenting a derivation of the wdt based on non - dispersive wave - packets .",
    "let us consider an incident gaussian wave packet in 1d representing an ensemble of non - interacting particles .",
    "@xmath131 is the weight of the @xmath132th fourier component in the incident gaussian wave packet .",
    "@xmath133 dk\\ ] ] after the wave packet traverses a distance @xmath134 , its form will be @xmath135 dk\\ ] ] here , @xmath136 is the transmission amplitude of the potential in the region of length @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath137 is the time that the wave packet would have taken if the potential was absent .",
    "@xmath138 is the time that the wave packet takes in presence of the potential .",
    "if we go to the semi - classical limit then we should get close to classical behavior that implies @xmath139 is also a gaussian wave - packet like @xmath140 . from this one",
    "can derive wdt .",
    "normally , @xmath136 is complex and energy dependent .",
    "this is the essential cause of dispersion .",
    "the weight of the @xmath132th component in the transmitted wave packet are @xmath141 and hence @xmath142 is no longer a gaussian wave packet .",
    "if @xmath136 is a real number , then the dispersion will be like a free particle as @xmath132 and @xmath28 in @xmath142 are identical to that of a free particle ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "one simple example where this happens is when the incident energy is much smaller than the potential height , wherein one gets @xmath1440 and @xmath145 - 1 . in this case",
    "@xmath146 is real .",
    "one finds the wdt @xmath147 and it correctly gives the pdos ( that is @xmath148 ) .",
    "this explains why fsr is exact in case of single channel fano resonance where the particle is completely reflected back due to an effective potential that is infinite .",
    "at the single channel fano resonance @xmath149 and wdt give the correct pdos .",
    "this also shows that the correctness of wdt and hence fsr at fano resonance is always true in single channel quantum wires .",
    "it requires the presence of a transmission zero and that is always there for all potentials that support a fano resonance .",
    "but the correctness of fsr or wdt does not only occur in case of single channel quantum wires where @xmath146=-1 as in semi - classical limit , but it also happens in multi channel quantum wires where @xmath1500 and @xmath1510 .",
    "so how for such a system wdt or fsr remain exact ?    in order to show how one can get non - dispersive wave packets in the presence of quantum scattering , we take clue from the kink - antikink solution of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "suppose we have a delta function potential in a 2 channel quantum wire .",
    "let us have four identical gaussian wave packets incident on it along all possible channels .",
    "that means two will be incident from the left and two will be incident from the right . among the two that are incident from the left , one will be in the first channel or in the fundamental transverse mode and one will be in the 2nd channel that is the first excited transverse mode .",
    "similarly for the two that are incident from the right .",
    "all these wave packets are scattered at the same time and we call this time @xmath152 . after scattering , the resultant wave packet on the right in the fundamental mode ( say ) and moving away from the potential and at a distance @xmath134 from the delta function potential will be @xmath153dk_1\\ ] ] @xmath154dk_2\\ ] ] @xmath155dk_1\\ ] ] @xmath156dk_2\\ ] ] here @xmath157 is for example the time taken by a particle in going from first channel in the left lead to the first channel on the right lead , and so on .",
    "one has to start with an infinitesimal potential so that with a small probability a particle goes from channel 2 on left to channel 1 on the right with an infinitesimal @xmath158 .",
    "and then by increasing the potential to its actual value , one can get actual @xmath158 etc .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "so fsr as well as wdt will be correct if @xmath161 is also a gaussian wave packet .",
    "one way to get that is if @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 are simultaneously real .",
    "because then the weight of the @xmath132th component is a real number times @xmath166 and further those real numbers are complimentary to each other and also summed .",
    "that is if @xmath162 increases then @xmath163 decreases and the first two terms in eq .",
    "32 compensate each other and so on .",
    "one can also show that @xmath167 , and @xmath168 . in the following figure",
    "we show that @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 are simultaneously real at the fano resonance . since they are real , their squares add up to make 1 .",
    "so they are also complementary to each other and compensate each other . if @xmath169 is small the @xmath172 is large and so on .",
    "actually , all the phase shifts vary strongly with energy as is expected in a quantum regime , but the variations are around 0 and becoming exactly 0 at the fano resonance .",
    "one can check the outgoing wave packets in the other channels also .",
    "they all show similar behavior at the fano resonance .",
    "although , the individual wave packets get strongly scattered , the four scatterings compensate each other in such a way that the outgoing waves are similar to the incoming waves .",
    "so the derivation of wdt holds good and so naturally the wdt also holds good . and then summing over all the particles making the wave packet , one naturally gets that fsr holds good .",
    "this provides a physical picture that helps us to understand why semi - classical formulas based on un - dispersed wave packets hold good in an extreme quantum regime .",
    "semi - classical formulas are always much simpler and easy to understand as it has classical analogies .",
    "for larger systems , that is when the sample size is larger than the inelastic mean free path , it has been argued that the scattering matrix approach do not take into account the conservation of charge @xcite .",
    "fsr can break down due to non - conservation of charge @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that even for mesoscopic systems , that is when sample size is smaller than inelastic mean free path , although charge is conserved , the scattering matrix approach does not give the dos exactly . in a quantum wire ,",
    "the correction term due to the evanescent modes is quite complicated and it is not possible to make any general statement about it like correction term is negligible in semi - classical regime and large in quantum regimes .",
    "quite counter intuitively , the correction term in eq .",
    "25 , becomes 0 at the fano resonance as a result of which the fsr becomes exact .",
    "we do not know of any system where this correction term can become exactly 0 .",
    "we have shown that in single channel quantum wire , this is true for all potential that exhibit a fano resonance as it only requires the presence of a transmission zero .",
    "we have also taken a scatterer in a multi channel quantum wire that has fano resonance , wherein all the @xmath173s are non zero and also strongly energy dependent .",
    "but the correction term is once again exactly 0 making the fsr exact at the fano resonance .",
    "we provide a physical understanding of this based on non - dispersive wave packets that are crucial for the derivation of semi - classical formulas like fsr and wdt .",
    "this gives us a general prescription to check for a given fano resonance in a multi - channel quantum wire , if semi - classical formulas will be exact or not .",
    "although , the quantum mechanical scattering can strongly disperse the different partial waves , the resultant of all possible partial waves in the hilbert space and their scattering compensate each other in such a way that the resultant wave - packet is un - dispersed .    the advantage of using fsr to know the dos of a system has certain advantages .",
    "it makes it un - necessary to find the local wave - functions inside a scatterer and also removes the problem of integrating the ldos to find the dos .",
    "also fsr is expected to work in presence of electron - electron interactions @xcite . an easy way to see",
    "this is to consider the kohn - sham theorem @xcite , which essentially means that an electron passing through an interacting system , actually passes through a one body effective potential that accounts for exchange and correlation effects exactly .",
    "the author is grateful to ictp , italy for support where a part of this work was done .",
    "let us calculate the dos @xmath174 for the system in fig .",
    "we first consider the electron incident from the left ( as shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , with incident wave vector @xmath132 .",
