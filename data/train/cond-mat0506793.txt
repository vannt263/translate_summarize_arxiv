    "recent discovery of superconductivity in the intermetallic perovskite mgcni@xmath0  @xcite with t@xmath4 k was a great surprise due to large ni contents and this compound was rather expected to be near ferromagnetic critical point  @xcite . it was established that electron ",
    "phonon mechanism is responsible for superconductivity in this material , but few details are still not clear .",
    "nmr @xmath5 relaxation time experiments  @xcite or specific heat measurements  @xcite have resulted in typical behaviors , supporting _",
    "s_wave type pairing with electron ",
    "phonon coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , rather unconventional behaviors have been observed in other experiments ( e.g. increase of critical temperature with pressure @xcite or unusual low  temperature behavior of london penetration depth @xmath7  @xcite ) , which can be partly connected with spin fluctuations likely appearing due to vicinity of ferromagnetism . moreover , complex dynamical properties of this superconductor , as e.g. soft  mode behaviors and instability of ni vibrations  @xcite ,  @xcite , make its theoretical analysis quite cumbersome .    in this paper",
    "we report on predictions of superconductivity in related sc@xmath0inb compound , which also seems to be close to magnetism limit due to weak ferromagnetic properties of sc@xmath0 in .",
    "it was already revealed that sc@xmath0inb crystallizes in a perovskite structure ( space group @xmath8m-3 m , catio@xmath0 type ) with lattice constant @xmath9   @xcite",
    ". however , the same number of valence electrons of boron and indium elements may give rise to lattice instabilities and in / b antisite defects are plausible .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed by full potential kkr method @xcite , @xcite within the lda framework employing von barth - hedin formula for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] presents electron density of states ( dos ) in sc@xmath0inb compound . the fermi level ( e@xmath1 )",
    "is located on the decreasing slope of large dos peak with the @xmath10 value being as large as @xmath11 states / ry .",
    "the main contributions can be attributed to sc ( @xmath12states ) and in ( @xmath13states ) ( see tab .  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "noteworthy , appearance of a large dos peak close to @xmath14 , coming essentially from transition metal ni@xmath12 states , was also characteristic of electronic structure of mgcni@xmath0 ( mg contribution was negligible ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the sc@xmath0inb case is not similar , since in plays more active role in formation of electronic states near @xmath14 due to one electron more on @xmath13shell .",
    "the best agreement for the main phase composition leads to consider that the p ",
    "elements b and in are neither fully ordered nor randomly distributed , with about 0.70  in and 0.30  b atom on the 1a site , then 0.65  in and 0.35  b atom on the 1b site of the space group @xmath8m-3 m .",
    "consideration for such a type of atomic disordering was already reported in literature  @xcite .",
    "both the compositions of the two compounds ( 3 - 1 - 1  and  2 - 1 ) confirm that boron is a difficult element to combine , thus the remaining boron should be detected in the xrd pattern , unless it is difficult to evidence effectively as a very light and often poorly crystallised element .",
    "susceptibility and resistivity measurements were made using a a.c .",
    "susceptometer in temperature ranging from 50 to 2  k. millimeter sized pieces of the ingot were measured successively and lead to the same results .",
    "a typical record is shown on figure  [ fig : exp ] , thus revealing the onset of a superconducting state down to 4.4  k , the transition being very sharp with no detectable hysteresis loop .",
    "a change in the resistivity trace was also observed simultaneously .",
    "unexpectedly , the rest of the ingot and the small pieces rapidly change their brittle and bright aspects after several hours let in ambient atmosphere .",
    "besides , a tentative to melt twice the main parts of the initial ingot was made , but at this time no evidence for any superconducting transition was found",
    ". then , several new syntheses were undertaken , thus operating as possible similarly as for the first one procedure .",
    "again , the new ingots we obtained do not display any transition down to 2  k. as revealed by the theoretical derivations ( see below ) , the superconducting state and the related transition look fairly dependant on the p  element ordering and the stoichiometry in the 1a and 1b sites .",
    "so , we anticipate that during and after the different melts , the new samples do not exhibit the same atom ordering as it was resulting from the first attempt .",
    "new syntheses are now scheduled to be undertaken using different methods and techniques in order to achieve optimized compounds .",
    "because of experimental problems with synthesis , effect of boron site vacancy on electronic structure near e@xmath1 and superconducting properties was simulated using kkr method with coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "we have found significant change in @xmath15 values not only for b , but also for sc , i.e. for 7% boron deficiency ( sc@xmath0inb@xmath16 ) , employing the same values of @xmath17 , total @xmath18 decreased over 30% to 0.62 , which resulted in @xmath19 k. in sc@xmath0inb@xmath20 coupling constant is so small ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22  k seems to be below the standard low  temperature measurements . similar decrease ( but less rapid than in the case of b vacancy ) of critical parameters was detected from kkr - cpa analysis when antisite in / b disorder increased .",
