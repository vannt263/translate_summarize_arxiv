    "spin coherent dynamics and transport in quantum dots has attracted a lot of attention due to its relevance to the potential new generation of spintronic devices@xcite ( e.g. , datta - das transistor@xcite and storage devices@xcite ) , and for quantum computation and information processes,@xcite where quantum coherence of the electron spin is desirable .",
    "recent experiments demonstrate the possibility to coherently manipulate quantum states of single and double electron spins in quantum dot systems.@xcite such control can be achieved , for instance , via fast bias / gate voltage pulses , electron spin resonance ( esr ) fields and coherent optical fields .",
    "those experiments indicate the feasibility of using a single electron in quantum dot system as a quantum bit and reveal encouraging spin coherence lifetimes for quantum processing .",
    "in addition , a variety of interesting spin - coherent effects have been reported during recent years .",
    "for instance , coherent rabi oscillations generated by an esr field were studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite in quantum dot systems in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "coherent spin - dynamics was probed via time - resolved faraday rotation ( trfr ) technique , revealing coherent dynamics of net carrier spins in semiconductor bulk , quantum well and quantum dots.@xcite in addition to quantum coherent oscillations , quantum beats of the spin magnetization due to zeeman splitting in a semiconductor quantum dot system were observed via time - resolved faraday rotation technique,@xcite and quantum beats in the trfr signal were measured for magnetic fields higher than @xmath3 t in a quantum dot system.@xcite quantum coherent beating in the magnetoresistance of a double - barrier structure with both diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) well and contacts was also predicted.@xcite additionally to this , coherent oscillations of polarized current in magnetotransport through zeeman split levels of quantum dots were investigated via quantum rate equations.@xcite    quantum coherent oscillations ( ringing ) of the current flowing through a single level quantum dot attached to nonmagnetic leads was predicted in a transient time scale after a bias voltage is turned on.@xcite here we describe transport in the same transient regime but including spin - dependent effects .",
    "an understanding of the spinfull case can better guide possible experimental measurements of the ringing response which now comes up with new spin - based signatures . here",
    "we apply the nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) formulation developed in [ ] to account for ( i ) zeeman splitting of the dot level and/or ( ii ) ferromagnetic leads .",
    "these two additional features introduce new spin - dependent effects . for example , the coherent oscillations reported previously in [ ] become spin - dependent with slightly different frequencies for each spin component of the current .",
    "this spin - splitting of the frequency generates quantum coherent beats of the total current @xmath4 and of the spin current @xmath5 .",
    "we also find a dynamical tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) that shows coherent oscillations , coherent beats and attains negative values in the transient regime for small enough temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the system and the formulation adopted , in sec .",
    "iii we present and discuss the results and in sec .",

    "it is composed of one quantum dot coupled via tunnel barriers to a left ( l ) and to a right ( r ) lead .",
    "both ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic leads are considered . for the ferromagnetic case both parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) alignments are analyzed .",
    "we assume that for zero bias voltage ( @xmath6 ) the spin-@xmath7 and spin-@xmath8 levels are above and below the fermi energy @xmath9 of the reservoirs , respectively .",
    "this _ prepared _ configuration gives rise to a relatively high transient spin current in the case of nonmagnetic leads as we will describe in sec .",
    "when the bias voltage is turned on ( @xmath10 ) both levels attain resonance with the emitter states , thus resulting in the subsequent spin dynamics .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the free - electron energy with a time - dependent contribution @xmath14 due to the bias voltage .",

    "we neglect the zeeman splitting of the leads @xmath26 in our model.@xcite the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 annihilate and create , respectively , one electron with spin @xmath18 in the dot.@xcite for the leads - dot coupling we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant coupling parameter .",
    "we do not account for spin relaxation and spin decoherence in our model , which is reasonable for short enough times .",
    "previous studies have found for the relaxation and decoherence times , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , typically @xmath33 ms@xcite and @xmath34s.@xcite    the time dependent current is given by a sum of the currents flowing into and out of the dot , @xmath35 . in the noninteracting case and wideband limit they read@xcite @xmath36,\\ ] ] and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the tunneling rate , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the constant density of states for spin @xmath18 in lead @xmath41(@xmath42 ) .",

    "( [ iin ] ) and ( [ iout ] ) we find the results presented in the next section .",
    "for comparison we apply the master equation ( me ) technique to calculate the current and spin - current .",
    "while the negf is valid for both @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the me approach is accurate only for @xmath55 ( sequential - tunneling limit ) .",
    "so we will restrict the comparison only for relatively high temperatures , which correspond to the range of mutual validity of the two approaches .",
    "the current expression in the me formulation is given by@xcite @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the probabilities to have no electron , one electron with spin @xmath18 and two electrons , respectively , in the dot .",

    "( [ imastereq])-([matrixm ] ) can account for coulomb interaction in the sequential limit , we are interested in comparing the results obtained from both the me and the negf ( which is noninteracting in the present formulation ) , thus we simply assume @xmath70 in the above me expressions .",
    "some effects of coulomb interaction in a transient response ( sequential limit ) can be found , for instance , in [ ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the total current @xmath4 and the spin current @xmath5 in the emitter lead,@xcite obtained via negf .",
    "different zeeman energies are considered .",
    "for @xmath2 there is no spin current [ fig . [ fig2](b ) ] and the current [ fig . [ fig2](a ) ] presents the typical coherent oscillations that arise after a bias voltage is turned on.@xcite the oscillatory frequency is given by @xmath71 ( or equivalently the period @xmath72 ) and the damping is due to the leads - dot coupling . we may note that for the parameters adopted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we have @xmath73.@xcite in the presence of zeeman splitting the frequency @xmath74 becomes spin dependent , with @xmath75 , so the spin components of the current oscillate with distinct frequencies . in the case of relatively close frequencies ,",
    "quantum beats of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are seen , with beating frequency given by @xmath78 [ figs . [ fig2](c)-(f ) ] .",
    "the spin current observed in the presence of zeeman energy [ figs .",
    "[ fig2](d ) and ( f ) ] comes from the initial configuration ( @xmath6 ) of the system . for @xmath6 the occupations are @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "when the bias voltage is turned on at @xmath0 the spin @xmath7 electrons in the emitter lead can start to flow through the dot , while the spin @xmath8 ones have to wait till the initial @xmath8 electron in the dot leaves to the collector lead ( pauli blockade ) . since this tunnel event takes a typical time of @xmath81 a spin current",
    "is expected in this time range . in the case of initially both @xmath80 and @xmath82 , which can be achieved by taking @xmath83 high enough in order to forbid thermal occupation of the spin split levels , an oscillatory spin current around zero is observed .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) we show @xmath84 and @xmath85 separately .",
    "for @xmath2 the currents @xmath84 and @xmath85 coincide , while for @xmath86 and @xmath87 they differ , thus generating spin current . eventually for high enough times ( @xmath88 ) both @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 become close to each other , thus resulting in @xmath89 . the difference in frequency for each spin component",
    "is clearly seen in figs . [ fig3](b)-(c ) . in particular as @xmath1 increases , we observe a blue shift for the frequency @xmath90 and a red shift for @xmath91 .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) we analyze the effects of temperature on the coherent oscillations .",
    "we find that as @xmath92 increases the oscillatory behavior tends to disappear in both the current and the spin - current .",
    "this is expected since with increasing @xmath93 the coherence is washed out . for comparison",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4](e)-(f ) the total and the spin currents calculated via the master equation technique ( dots ) .",
    "we find close agreement between the nonequilibrium green function and the master equation results , except by the strongly suppressed coherent oscillations still seen in the negf calculation for @xmath94 .",
    "as the temperature increases these coherent oscillations ( ringing ) disappear and both negf and me approaches give equal results . additionally to this",
    ", we note that the spin current is suppressed with increasing @xmath92 .",
    "for even higher temperatures we find zero spin current for all times , which is related to the fact that @xmath95 approaches @xmath96 with increasing @xmath92thus resulting in a less effective transient pauli blockade . when the leads are ferromagnetic , though , the source of spin current is not only the initial configuration of the system but also the leads itself , so @xmath77 remains nonzero even for high temperatures , as we describe next .",
    "figure ( [ fig5 ] ) shows the current and the spin current against time in the presence of ferromagnetic leads for differing temperatures and @xmath86 .",
    "both p and ap configurations are analyzed .",
    "here we have enlarged the time scale compared to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] because some contrasting features between p and ap alignments are better seen after @xmath97 ( e.g. , @xmath98 ) . for @xmath99",
    "the standard inequality @xmath98 is only true when we approach the sequential limit for @xmath94 .",
    "curiously , for @xmath100 and @xmath101 we find @xmath102 slightly above @xmath103 for @xmath99 .",
    "this unusual behavior can be qualitatively understood in terms of tunnel rates and the initial ( _ prepared _ ) spin - population of the dot .",
    "initially ( @xmath6 ) the dot is occupied by one spin @xmath8 electron . when the bias voltage is applied ( @xmath10 )",
    "this electron can leave the dot to the collector lead with a tunnel rate given by @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath104 is bigger for ap than for p configuration , the initial spin @xmath8 electron leaves the dot faster in the ap alignment .",
    "this turns the pauli blockade less effective in this configuration , thus allowing the emitter current @xmath102 to be slightly greater than @xmath103 at initial times .",
    "when @xmath92 exceeds the coupling strength @xmath45 , the coherent oscillations of both the current and the spin current are strongly suppressed and the standard inequality @xmath105 is recovered even for short times after @xmath0 .",
    "here we also see an agreement between the results obtained via negf and me , except by the coherent oscillations residually present in the negf calculation for @xmath94 . as the temperature increases even further these residual oscillations of the current and the spin - current",
    "are washed out and both negf and me approaches converge to the same results . finally , we observe that the spin current does not tend to zero with increasing temperature as we see in the nonmagnetic case [ compare figs .",
    "[ fig4](f ) and [ fig5](f ) ] .",
    "the suppression of @xmath77 is observed only with increasing time in the ap alignment , remaining finite for the stationary limit in the p configuration .    in fig .",
    "( [ figtmr ] ) we show the time - dependent tmr , defined as tmr=@xmath106 .",
    "coherent oscillations and quantum beats are seen for both @xmath100 and @xmath107 and is only residually observed for @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly , the tmr attains negative values for short times and small temperatures.@xcite in panel ( c ) we compare the tmr obtained via negf ( solid line ) and me ( dots ) with essentially no contrast between them .    finally in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the spin resolved currents and the spin current in the ferromagnetic case for @xmath2 . here",
    "[ in contrast to the nonmagnetic case , fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] and no beats are seen since @xmath84 and @xmath85 have the same frequency .",
    "additionally , the oscillation amplitudes and the decaying rates can differ for each spin component . in the parallel configuration",
    "we observe that @xmath84 starts oscillating with a higher amplitude than @xmath85 but its oscillations are faster suppressed .",
    "this is due to the inequality @xmath109 .",
    "the interplay between oscillation amplitudes and decaying rates gives rise to a _",
    "node _ in the spin current seen around @xmath110 [ fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ] . for long enough times",
    "both @xmath84 and @xmath85 attain their respective stationary values with @xmath111 [ fig . [ fig7](a ) ] . in the ap alignment @xmath84 starts oscillating with a higher amplitude than @xmath85 but , in contrast to the p case , the decaying rate is the same for both spin component ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "consequently no node is observed in the spin current , which simply oscillates decaying to zero .",
    "we have calculated spin - dependent transport through a zeeman split quantum dot level after a bias voltage is turned on .",
    "the dot is coupled to two leads ( source and drain ) that can be ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic .",
    "quantum coherent oscillations ( ringing ) and beats of the current and of the spin current are found in a transient time scale .",
    "the frequency of the beats can be tuned via the zeeman splitting energy @xmath1 .",
    "we also report a spin current @xmath77 that arises when @xmath113 and @xmath114 for nonmagnetic leads . for the ferromagnetic case",
    "the spin current can be seen even for @xmath2 and high temperatures ( @xmath115 ) . in particular",
    "@xmath77 goes to zero as the time evolves in the ap alignment and remains finite in the stationary limit for the p configuration .",
    "the tunnel magnetoresistance was also analyzed .",
    "we found quantum coherent beats and negative values of the tmr due to the transient dynamics of incoming and outgoing spin polarized electrons in the quantum dot .",
