    "the galactic centre ( gc ) probably harbours a great number of transient x - ray sources .",
    "past x - ray observations have revealed that the majority of the transient sources with the luminosity of @xmath4erg  s@xmath3 are low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , containing a neutron star or black hole ( eg . , sakano et al .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations have lowered the detection threshold by 12 orders , thus providing access to potential new x - ray populations of sources with luminosity in the range @xmath5@xmath6erg  s@xmath3 . here",
    "we report two relatively faint x - ray transients , which exhibit unusual properties .",
    "we have compared the _ xmm - newton_/epic and _ chandra_/acis survey data obtained during the period between september 2000 and june 2002 .",
    "we detected several transients within the 0.3@xmath70.3  deg@xmath8 field centred at ( @xmath9,@xmath10)=(@xmath11 , @xmath12 ) . among them",
    "we detected xmm j174544@xmath02913.0 and xmm j174457@xmath02850.3 at the respective j2000 positions of ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) coordinates with an error radius of 8@xmath17 .",
    "xmm j174544@xmath02913.0 was detected in september 2000 ( @xmath18erg  s@xmath3 ) , but not in july or september 2001 with the lowest 3@xmath19 upper limit for the 210 kev luminosity of @xmath20erg  s@xmath3 , assuming a distance of 8.0  kpc . as for xmm",
    "j174457@xmath02850.3 we determined its 210 kev x - ray luminosity to be @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23erg  s@xmath3 in july 2001 , september 2001 and may 2002 respectively .",
    "furthermore , in the july 2001 observation the source flux declined by a factor of two or more in 10  ks .",
    "[ fig : spec ] show the _ xmm _ spectra of the two sources when they were in the high state .",
    "xmm j174544@xmath02913.0 was found to have an extremely strong iron line with a centre energy of 6.68@xmath240.02 kev and an equivalent width ( ew ) of 2.4@xmath25 kev , whereas xmm j174457@xmath02850.3 exhibits a very hard continuum with photon index of 0.98@xmath26 with a weak 6.7-kev line ( ew=180@xmath24140 ev ) .",
    "both the spectra are absorbed by a large column density : 12.4@xmath241.8 and 5.9@xmath241.1 @xmath27 h  @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "xmm j174457@xmath02850.3 showed marginal evidence for softening of the spectrum from the high state ( @xmath29 ) to low state ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the strong iron line and transient nature of xmm j174544@xmath02913.0 is quite similar to ax j1842.8@xmath00423 ( terada et al .",
    "thus , as suggested by terada et al . , it is likely to be a magnetised cataclysmic variable ( cv ) viewed from a pole - on inclination , which causes an apparently strong line at 6.7 kev from helium - like iron .",
    "however the large luminosity of over @xmath6erg  s@xmath3 is quite unusual for cvs and some additional component , for example a jet , may contribute to the observed emission .    the nearly featureless and flat spectrum of xmm j174457@xmath02850.3 , as well as the existence of diffuse emission around the source , suggests that it may be a neutron star or black hole binary . the weak but significant iron line and the flat index point to this being a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "however , both the quiescent luminosity of @xmath23erg  s@xmath3 and the peak observed luminosity of @xmath31erg  s@xmath3 are unusually low , suggesting the possibility of a wide eccentric orbit characteristic of many be star x - ray binary systems ."
