    "problems concerning planar graphs have always been among the most extensively studied topics in graph theory . in this paper",
    ", we study a generalization of proper coloring introduced by ore and plummer in 1969  @xcite : a _ cyclic coloring _ of a plane graph is a vertex - coloring such that any two vertices incident with the same face receive distinct colors . the cyclic coloring conjecture of borodin  @xcite asserts that every plane graph with maximum face size @xmath1 has a cyclic coloring with at most @xmath8 colors .",
    "there are many results on the cyclic coloring conjecture and related problems .",
    "we would like to particularly mention the facial coloring conjecture of  @xcite , which implies the cyclic coloring conjecture for odd values of @xmath1 .",
    "this conjecture , which was addressed e.g.  in  @xcite , asserts that every plane graph has an @xmath9-facial coloring with at most @xmath10 colors , i.e.  a vertex coloring such that any vertices joined by a facial walk of size at most @xmath9 receive different colors .",
    "we refer the reader to in an excellent survey  @xcite by borodin for further results related to the cyclic coloring conjecture .    despite a significant amount of interest ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the cyclic coloring conjecture has been proven only for three values of @xmath1 : the case @xmath3 , which is equivalent to the four color theorem proven in  @xcite ( a simplified proof was given in  @xcite ) , the case @xmath4 known as borodin s six color theorem  @xcite , and the recently proven case @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "amini , esperet and van den heuvel  @xcite , building on the work in  @xcite , proved an asymptotic version of the cyclic coloring conjecture : for every @xmath12 , there exists @xmath13 such that every plane graph with maximum face size @xmath14 has a cyclic coloring with at most @xmath15 colors .",
    "the graphs which witness that the bound in the cyclic coloring conjecture is the best possible contain vertices of degree two ; in particular , they are not @xmath0-connected . in 1987 ,",
    "plummer and toft  @xcite conjectured the following :    [ conj ] every @xmath0-connected plane graph with maximum face size @xmath1 has a cyclic coloring with at most @xmath2 colors .",
    "this conjecture is the main subject of this paper .",
    "we would like to remark that conjecture  [ conj ] fails if the assumption on @xmath0-connectivity is replaced with the weaker assumption that the minimum degree is at least @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the upper bound stated in conjecture  [ conj ] is not tight for large @xmath16 : borodin and woodall  @xcite showed that every @xmath0-connected plane graph with maximum face size @xmath17 has a cyclic coloring with at most @xmath18 colors , and this bound was lowered to @xmath19 by enomoto , hork and jendrol  @xcite .",
    "conjecture  [ conj ] has been proven for all but finitely many values of @xmath1 .",
    "the cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 follow from four color theorem and borodin s six color theorem , respectively .",
    "the conjecture was proven for @xmath20 in  @xcite , for @xmath21 in  @xcite , for @xmath22 in  @xcite and finally for @xmath5 in  @xcite .",
    "our main result is a proof of the cases @xmath23 and @xmath24 of conjecture  [ conj ] :    [ main - thm ] every 3-connected plane graph with maximum face size @xmath25 has a cyclic coloring that uses at most @xmath2 colors .",
    "we employ the discharging method to prove theorem  [ main - thm ] ; we refer to the survey  @xcite for a detailed exposition of the method .",
    "we start by identifying a set of configurations that can not be contained in a minimal counterexample , i.e. , a counterexample with the smallest number of vertices , in section  [ sec - redu ] .",
    "such configurations are referred to as _",
    "reducible configurations_. we then consider a minimal counterexample @xmath26 and assign _ initial charges _ to the vertices and faces of @xmath26 with the property that the sum of the initial charges is negative .",
    "we then redistribute the charge using _ discharging rules _",
    ", which are described in section  [ sec - rules ] .",
    "the redistribution preserves the overall sum of the charges .",
    "finally , we show that if @xmath26 contains none of the reducible configurations , then every vertex and face has non - negative charge after applying the rules in section  [ sec - analysis ] , which is a contradiction .    unfortunately , the arguments related to checking the reducibility of some of the configurations and the analysis of the final charge turned out to be complex and we had to resort to computer assistance .",
    "we have made our programs verifying the correctness of our proof available on - line at  http://www.ucw.cz/~kral/cyclic-16/ ; we have also uploaded their source codes to arxiv as ancillary files .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the notation used in our proof . throughout this paper ,",
    "all of the graphs that will be considered are plane graphs unless explicitly stated .",
    "@xmath27-vertex _ is a vertex of degree @xmath27 .",
    "we also define a _ @xmath28-vertex _ to be a vertex with degree at least @xmath27 , and a _",
    "@xmath29-vertex _ to be a vertex with degree at most @xmath27 .",
    "the _ size _ of a face @xmath30 of a plane graph , denoted by @xmath31 , is the number of vertices that are incident with it .",
    "analogous to the definition of a @xmath27-vertex , a @xmath27-face is a face of size @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , a _",
    "@xmath28-face _ and a _ @xmath29-face _ are faces that have size at least @xmath27 and at most @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the _ boundary walk _ of a face in a plane graph is the sequence of vertices that bounds the face .",
    "a pair of vertices are said to be _ cyclically adjacent _ if they are incident to a common face .",
    "the _ cyclic degree _ of a vertex is the number of vertices which are cyclically adjacent to it .",
    "most of the configurations are depicted in figures [ fig - triangles+column][fig - gen ] using the notation that we now describe .",
    "a circled vertex in a configuration depicts its exact degree , i.e. , the vertex must be incident with as many edges as depicted in the figure .",
    "the vertices depicted by bold circles are required to have the cyclic degree equal to the number given in the figure next to the vertex in addition to having the degree as depicted .",
    "in addition , we sometimes restrict the face sizes by writing the constraint on the face size in the middle of the face ; for example in the first configuration depicted in figure  [ fig - gen ] , the bottom middle face is required to have size at least @xmath32 and the top left face is required to have size @xmath33 , where @xmath9 is the size of the bottom middle face .",
    "when describing the discharging rules , we use the following notation ( see figure  [ fig - triangles+column ] for an illustration ) . let @xmath34 be a part of the boundary walk of a face @xmath30 .",
    "with respect to a face @xmath30 , a triangle @xmath35 is an _ a - triangle _ if @xmath36 , a _",
    "b - triangle _",
    "if @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the neighbors @xmath39 and @xmath40 of @xmath41 distinct from @xmath42 and @xmath43 are adjacent , and a _ c - triangle _ if @xmath44 is neither an a - triangle nor a b - triangle .",
    "if @xmath34 is incident with a @xmath45-face @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is incident with another @xmath45-face , we say that @xmath49 is a _ column _",
    "( with respect to @xmath30 ) . if @xmath50 is a part of the boundary walk of a face @xmath30 and neither @xmath51 nor @xmath52 is contained in a @xmath53-face , we say that @xmath54 is _ isolated _ ( with respect to @xmath30 ) .",
    "if @xmath55 and @xmath54 is contained in a @xmath53-face @xmath56 that does not share an edge with @xmath30 , then we say that @xmath56 is the _ sink _ of @xmath54 ; otherwise , @xmath54 is the sink of itself .",
    "a large part of our proof is computer - assisted .",
    "however , the proof itself was also constructed in a computer - assisted way .",
    "once the types of the discharing rules are fixed , e.g. , we have decided to transfer some amount of charge from a face of some given size @xmath9 to an incident @xmath57-triangle , the conditions that the final charge of every vertex and face is non - negative become linear constraints .",
    "more precisely , there is a single variable for each rule type , and a single linear constraint for each possible neighborhood structure of a vertex or a face that is not excluded by reducible configurations .",
    "hence , the amounts of charge transferred by individual rules can be determined by solving a linear program ( or it is determined that no such amounts for the given set of rule types using existing reducible configurations ) .",
    "we remark that this approach that we have followed is not new and has actually been used by various researchers earlier .",
    "let us give more details about how we have proceeded in the case of our proof .",
    "first , it is not clear what types of discharging rules should be considered .",
    "we started with rule types close to those in subsections  [ sec - large ] , [ sec - med ] and [ sec - heavy ] and later added further rule types in an ad hoc way .",
    "we then repeated the following steps .",
    "we ran a linear program solver to determine a minimal set of infeasible constraints .",
    "each such constraint corresponds to a particular neighborhood structure ( configuration ) . to proceed further , it was necessary to either find a new reducible configuration that would exclude one of these configurations or add a new rule type that would move charge inside the configuration .",
    "after this , we reran the linear program solver to determine a new minimal set of infeasible constraints .",
    "when the solver produced a solution , we found a possible set of discharging rules , i.e. , a proof .",
    "since each rule type adds a new variable to the linear program , it is necessary to be careful with adding new rule types to keep the linear program of manageable size .",
    "for example , it would have been ideal to have rules of the types as those in subsection  [ sec - addit ] for all face sizes but this would have resulted in a linear program too large to be solved in a reasonable amount of time . as a compromise , we have started with rougher rules from subsection  [ sec - med ] and combine them with finer rules from subsection  [ sec - addit ] .",
    "another concern might be that most linear program solvers ( we have used the gurobi solver ) work in floating arithmetic ; however , the solution output by the solver can be rounded to rational values and checked with exact arithmetic computations .",
    "in this section , we describe reducible configurations that are used in our proof .",
    "the reducible configurations in figures [ triangle0][fig - gen ] are named using the following convention : the name of the configuration refers to the size of a face that the configuration primarily concerns and the subscript is used to distinguish different types of configurations related to faces of the same size .",
    "in addition to the configurations presented in the figures , there are two additional reducible configurations : deg is the configuration comprised of a single vertex with cyclic degree at most @xmath58 , and tfedge is the configuration comprised of a @xmath0-face and a @xmath53-face sharing an edge .",
    "these two configurations are reducible by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1(e ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.6 ) , respectively .",
    "we will also need the following proposition to justify the reducibility of some of our configurations .",
    "[ prop-3ver ] if @xmath26 is a @xmath0-connected graph with at least five vertices , then every vertex of degree three is incident with an edge @xmath59 such that the contraction of @xmath59 yields a @xmath0-connected graph .      in this subsection",
    ", we introduce reducible configurations triangle@xmath60 , triangle@xmath61 and triangle@xmath62 , and argue that they are reducible . the configurations can be found in figures  [ triangle0 ] , [ triangle1 ] and [ triangle2 ] .",
    "when analyzing the configurations , we use the following notation . let @xmath57 be the face that is incident with the vertices @xmath63 and @xmath64 but is not the @xmath0-face , and denote by @xmath65 the set of colors that appear on all of the vertices that are incident with @xmath57 except for the vertices @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , we define the faces @xmath67 and @xmath68 to be the faces incident with the edges @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "[ triangle - lemma ] the three configurations denoted by triangle@xmath60 , which are depicted in figure  [ triangle0 ] , and the configuration denoted by triangle@xmath61 , which is depicted in figure  [ triangle1 ] , and the two configurations denoted by triangle@xmath62 , which are depicted in figure  [ triangle2 ] , are reducible .",
    "assume that a minimal counterexample @xmath26 contains one of the configurations in figures  [ triangle0 ] ,  [ triangle1 ] or  [ triangle2 ] and let @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 ( otherwise , @xmath26 would contain the reducible configuration tfedge ) .",
    "first contract the edge @xmath73 ( the resulting graph is @xmath0-connected by proposition  [ prop-3ver ] ) . by minimality , we can color the resulting graph with @xmath2 colors .",
    "this yields a coloring of @xmath26 of all vertices except for @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath74 is non - empty , then @xmath64 is cyclically adjacent to vertices of at most @xmath18 colors and we can complete the coloring . hence , assume that @xmath75 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath63 was colored with @xmath76 , @xmath77 with @xmath78 , @xmath59 with @xmath0 , @xmath30 with @xmath9 and @xmath79 with @xmath2 .",
    "we can also assume that @xmath80 contains the colors from @xmath45 to @xmath81 and @xmath82 contains the colors from @xmath83 to @xmath18 .",
    "we first analyze the three configurations depicted in figure  [ triangle0 ] .",
    "if we can recolor @xmath63 with a color from @xmath84 , then we can color @xmath64 with @xmath76 , so @xmath85 .",
    "if we can recolor @xmath77 with a color from @xmath86 , then @xmath64 can be colored with @xmath78 , hence @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , @xmath88 contains all the colors from @xmath0 to @xmath18 , which is impossible since @xmath89 .",
    "we next analyze the configuration depicted in figure  [ triangle1 ] .",
    "if we can recolor @xmath77 with a color from @xmath90 , then we can color @xmath64 with @xmath78 , hence @xmath91 .",
    "likewise , if we can recolor @xmath63 with a color from @xmath92 , then we can color @xmath64 with @xmath76 . in particular",
    ", the vertex @xmath63 is cyclically adjacent to vertices with the colors from @xmath45 to @xmath81 and to two vertices of each of the colors from @xmath93 ( once on the face @xmath57 and once on the face @xmath67 ) .",
    "in addition to these @xmath94 vertices , @xmath63 is also cyclically adjacent to @xmath77 , @xmath64 , @xmath59 and @xmath30 .",
    "hence , its cyclic degree must be at least @xmath95 , which violates the description of the configuration .",
    "it remains to analyze the configurations depicted in figure  [ triangle2 ] .",
    "let @xmath96 be the set containing all colors in @xmath97 and the color assigned to the vertex of the @xmath45-face containing @xmath77 that is not adjacent to @xmath77 .",
    "since the cyclic degree of @xmath77 is at most @xmath98 , it holds @xmath99 . if we can recolor @xmath77 with a color from @xmath100 , then @xmath64 can be colored with @xmath78 .",
    "hence , @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath63 can be recolored with @xmath0 or @xmath45 , we can color @xmath64 with @xmath76 .",
    "since this is impossible and @xmath102 , it holds that @xmath103 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath96 contains at least @xmath104 colors , which exceeds its size .",

    "* lemma 3.1(d ) ) .",
    "the reducibility of the remaining configurations was verified with the assistance of a computer .",
    "we have independently prepared two programs , which are available at http://www.ucw.cz/~kral/cyclic-16/ as ` test - reducibility1.c ` and ` test-reducibility2.cc ` .",
    "the input files needed to check the reducibility of the configurations are also available on - line .",
    "we next describe the structure of the input files and the way used to reduce the configurations .",
    "we have verified that all configurations depicted in figures  [ fig - four][fig - gen ] are reducible in the following manner .",
    "if a possible minimal counterexample @xmath26 contains the configuration in question , we replace it with a configuration with a smaller number of vertices to obtain a graph @xmath105 .",
    "each input file consists of two blocks : the first block describes the new configuration and the second block the original configuration , i.e. , the configuration that we are verifying to be reducible .",
    "the two blocks have a similar structure .",
    "the first line of each block contains two integers @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the integer @xmath106 is the number of faces forming the configuration and @xmath107 is the number of vertices with no neighbors outside the configuration ( these are the circled vertices in the figures ) .",
    "let us call such vertices _",
    "each of the following @xmath106 lines describes one of the faces of the configuration .",
    "there are two kinds of faces : _ bounded _ faces with a specific size and _ unbounded _ faces with size between @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( inclusively ) for some @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "a line describing a bounded face starts with @xmath112 and it is followed by the list of vertices incident with the face .",
    "the internal vertices incident with the face are represented by numbers between @xmath76 and @xmath107 and the remaining vertices incident with the face are represented by lowercase letters .",
    "a description of an unbounded face in the first block starts with a range @xmath113@xmath114 ; it is possible that @xmath115 .",
    "the rest of the line contains all internal vertices of the face and possibly some others represented by lowercase letters .",
    "in addition to these vertices , the face is incident with @xmath27 vertices where @xmath27 satisfies that @xmath116 ( note that @xmath117 in general ) . in the second block ,",
    "the line describing an unbounded face starts with a positive integer giving the index of the corresponding face in the first block ( the indices start from one ) .",
    "for example , the input file to verify the reducibility of the configuration eight@xmath60 that is depicted in figure  [ fig - explred ] is the following .    .... 5 9 5 - 7 a 8,9 8 - 9 - 5,6,7,9 7 - 9 - 2,3,4,5,6 5 - 7 b 1,2 0 ab 1,3,4,7,8 5 10 1 a 8,9 2 - 5,6,7,9,10 3 - 2,3,4,5,6 4",
    "b 1,2 0 ab 1,3,4,7,8,10 ....    note that we have not specified the three @xmath0-faces formed by internal vertices , e.g. , the one formed by the vertices @xmath76 , @xmath78 and @xmath0 , since the constraints that they impose on the coloring are implied by the presence of the other faces . in addition , we have also not specified the existence of the other @xmath0-face containing the vertex @xmath78 . if the configuration can be checked to be reducible without this additional assumption , it is also reducible with this additional assumption ( we give more details further ) .",
    "the program assumes the existence of a cyclic coloring of @xmath105 using at most @xmath2 colors and checks using this assumption that @xmath26 also has a cyclic coloring using at most @xmath2 colors .",
    "when doing so , we assume that all the faces described in the input are pairwise different .",
    "for example , the face incident with @xmath118 and @xmath32 is different from the face incident with @xmath76 and @xmath78 in figure  [ fig - explred ] . in all the configurations that we analyze , all the faces share vertices with a single face of the configuration and hence this assumption is valid because the graph @xmath26 is @xmath0-connected .",
    "another fact that needs to be verified is that @xmath105 is @xmath0-connected ; for most of our reductions , this is implied by proposition  [ prop-3ver ] since the contracted edge is incident with a @xmath0-vertex contained in a @xmath0-face formed by three @xmath0-vertices ( in the example , the edge contracted joins the vertices @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) . in the remaining few cases ,",
    "this follows by an easy analysis of the configurations .",
    "in addition , the ranges of the numbers of non - internal vertices on unbounded faces are determined using the absence of the configurations deg and triangle@xmath60 .",
    "for example , since the vertex @xmath0 has cyclic degree at least @xmath121 , the unbounded face incident with it must have size between @xmath122 and @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the number of non - internal vertices incident with this face is between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which corresponds to the range @xmath119@xmath32 given in the input file .",
    "we now describe how the program checks the existence of a cyclic coloring of @xmath26 .",
    "the program enumerates all possible colorings of non - internal vertices and checks whether the coloring extends in @xmath105 , and if so , it also checks that it extends in @xmath26 .",
    "note that some of the colorings of non - internal vertices considered by the program are not feasible .",
    "for example , we have neglected in the considered configuration one of the @xmath0-faces containing the vertex @xmath78 and the constraints that it imposes . since testing the extendibility of a larger set of colorings",
    "does not harm the validity of our arguments , this does not affect the correctness of our arguments as long as all the constraints on the coloring of internal vertices are represented .",
    "in fact , this negligence is useful in the considered case since the very same input file can be used to justify the reducibility of all the configurations eight@xmath60 .",
    "in this section , we describe the discharging phase of our proof .",
    "each vertex @xmath54 of a minimal counterexample is assigned charge @xmath125 and each face @xmath30 is assigned @xmath126 . using euler s formula ,",
    "the overall sum of the initial charge is @xmath127 .",
    "the charge then gets redistributed among the vertices and faces as follows .",
    "first , each @xmath0-vertex @xmath54 that is contained in exactly one @xmath53-face gets @xmath76 from this face , and each @xmath0-vertex @xmath54 that is contained in two @xmath45-faces @xmath128 and @xmath129 gets @xmath130 from each of @xmath128 and @xmath129 ; note that a @xmath0-vertex can not be contained in a @xmath0-face and a @xmath53-face .",
    "other rules are more complex and are described in the rest of the section .",
    "we start with simpler rules to redistribute the charge , which we call basic rules , and we then tune the discharging process by introducing more complex rules .",
    "each face @xmath131 of size @xmath132 redistributes its charge as follows .",

    "* each c - triangle and non - column @xmath45-face that shares an edge @xmath34 with @xmath131 receives @xmath134 from @xmath131 , where @xmath135 is @xmath112 if the third face incident with @xmath136 is a @xmath53-face , and @xmath135 is @xmath76 , otherwise .",
    "* the sink of each isolated vertex incident with @xmath131 receives ` iso`@xmath133 from @xmath131 .",

    "each of these rules can be associated with one of the vertices @xmath136 , @xmath194 , and its amount only depends on the sizes of the faces containing @xmath136 ( in addition to the shape of @xmath30 ) .",

    "the analysis of the final charge of @xmath45-faces is similar to that of @xmath0-faces .",
    "we now focus of faces with sizes between @xmath148 and @xmath196 ( inclusively ) .",
    "the _ inventory _ of a face is the number of adjacent a - triangles , b - triangles , columns and @xmath53-faces distinguished by the number of their vertices that are incident with another @xmath53-face .",
    "the inventory is enough to determine the final of @xmath145-faces .",
    "the program enumerates all possible inventories of @xmath145-faces and checks that the final charge of all @xmath145-faces is non - negative .",
    "the program also enumerate possible inventories of @xmath9-faces , @xmath197 , discards those that give a non - negative lower bound on the final amount of charge of the considered face @xmath30 .",
    "for each of the non - discarded inventories , the program enumerates all cyclic orders determining which the edges of the @xmath9-face are contained in the elements of the inventory .",
    "some of the enumerated configurations can be excluded by the reducible configurations and get discarded ( this actually finishes off the analysis of @xmath156-faces and @xmath171-faces ) .",
    "in addition , lower bounds of the sizes of the other faces adjacent to @xmath30 are obtained , e.g. , the configuration gen@xmath62 is used to establish that an incident face must have size at least @xmath198 . in the remaining cases",
    ", the program enumerates all possible sizes of faces that affect the charge sent or received by @xmath30 , i.e. , faces next to a - triangles , faces incident with @xmath0-vertices of c - triangles at @xmath199-faces , and faces incident with the @xmath0-vertices of non - column @xmath45-faces at @xmath148-faces , and it checks that the final charge of @xmath30 is non - negative .",
    "it remains to analyze the final amount of charge of @xmath200-faces .",
    "we account the charge sent out by a @xmath9-face @xmath30 to its vertices , @xmath201 .",
    "if @xmath34 is an edge of @xmath30 shared contained in an a - triangle , b - triangle or a column , then @xmath202 is assigned to each of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath42 is an isolated vertex , it is assigned ` iso`@xmath203 .",
    "if @xmath167 is a path on the boundary of @xmath30 and @xmath34 is contained in a c - triangle or a non - column @xmath45-face , then @xmath204 is assigned to @xmath42 and @xmath205 is assigned to @xmath43 . if the edge @xmath163 is also in a triangle or a @xmath45-face @xmath30 ( which can not be an @xmath57-triangle , @xmath67-triangle or a column ) , then @xmath206 and we assign @xmath207 to @xmath43 in addition , i.e. , @xmath43 is assigned @xmath208 in total .",
    "otherwise , @xmath209 and @xmath43 is assigned @xmath210 .",
