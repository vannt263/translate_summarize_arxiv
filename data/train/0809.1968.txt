    "in recent years , there has been an increased awareness of the threats posed by newly emerging and high - profile infections disease , such as sars , the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , hiv , ebola , whooping cough , dengue fever and the spread of influenza .",
    "these diseases exhibit large scale spatial contagions and long - term spatial patterns  @xcite .    at present",
    ", there is a great deal of interest in the role of spatial structure in both ecology and epidemics .",
    "all systems are to some degree spatially extended ; however , the classical theory of the dynamics of epidemics ignores spatial effects with its assumption of homogeneous mixing .",
    "it is likely that local processes will play an important role in the majority of infectious diseases interactions particularly when an infection occurs through the direct contact of infected and susceptible individuals  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "there has been some attempt to take explicitly spatial structure into account when examining the spreading of parasites  @xcite . for example , recent models show that interactions between local populations may generate complex spatial patterns by dispersal  @xcite . in modern societies",
    ", individuals can easily travel over a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "the interconnections of areas and populations through various means of transport have important effects on the geographical spread of epidemics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the spatial structure and the different levels of the diffusion and transport processes are responsible for the heterogeneity , that is an erratic outbreak patterns observed in the worldwide propagation and persistence of diseases  @xcite , recently documented for synchronization and waves  @xcite , and large - scale spatial patterns ( e.g. spiral waves  @xcite and turing patterns  @xcite ) in measles , dengue fever , sars , and influenza . in order to describe such a complex phenomenon and develop powerful numerical forecasting tools , different levels of description are possible , ranging from a simple global mean - field to detailed individual - based simulation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , cellular automata  @xcite , coupled map lattices  @xcite , etc .",
    "dispersing individuals may react in a complex manner to local ecological and epidemiological situations  @xcite , but rare long - distance dispersal events may be important in nature  @xcite .",
    "the modeling methods that summarize dispersal in a diffusion coefficient in the classical theory  partial differential equations  cannot give insights into the importance of rare events  @xcite .",
    "for humans and other social animals in which hosts are distributed in heterogeneous patches on a large scale , there are two critical sides to transmit .",
    "the first is local transmission among individuals within patches or communities ( cites , towns , and villages ) .",
    "the second is the transmission between patches . with this point of view",
    ", there is a clear conceptual link between ecological and epidemiological theory ; a body of recent works have focused on the analogies of the spatial dynamics between infectious disease and ecological metapopulations  @xcite .",
    "the twofold issues are to dissect how infection processes at the local scale determine spatio - temporal patterns of epidemics and understand how these patterns are affected by the spatial spread between neighborhoods or patches , for instance , the epidemic wavefronts observed in the spatio - temporal spread of the black death in europe from 1347 to 1350  @xcite and west nile virus  @xcite .    generally speaking , several generic questions can be asked when studying the dynamics of epidemic spreading .",
    "one is the explanation of the possible oscillations   with respect to the temporal evolution of the densities of infection waves in homogeneous or heterogeneous realistic situation , as well as the spatial resonance problem .",
    "another one concerns the study of the possibility that a disease spreading eventually arrives at a steady states and the time arrived  @xcite .",
    "in addition , our model can also investigate what enables some species to persist while others become extinct .",
    "this question has shaped the history of research on population dynamics and remains a central issue for ecologists and epidemiologists  @xcite .",
    "although the spatial structure has been developed for susceptible - infected - resistant ( sirs ) models in previous studies , the modulation of such effects in combination with individuals mobility is also unknown .",
    "we aim to bridge this gap in this paper .",
    "specifically , we aim to elucidate the phase space on the extinction and persistence and contrast them with the prediction obtained mean - field , as well as the effect of mobility on persistence criteria .",
    "we also examine how the spatial pattern depend on the mobility and coupling strength within multi - patches case .",
    "in a recent report , van ballegooijen and boerlijst ( vbb ) showed that there were three types of spatial pattern in a spatial susceptible - infected - resistant model for disease dynamics by using a grid - structured contact network , also called cellular automata model  @xcite .",
    "they were localized disease outbreaks with self - limiting in size , turbulent waves , and stable spiral waves respectively .",
    "furthermore , they predicted that there existed a trade - off between the parameters of infection period and infection rate , which emerges from the evolutionary dynamics of the system on the stable spiral waves , and referred to this relationship as _ emergent trade - off_. these results give a guide to understand the spatial features of epidemic such as wave speed and wavelength , as well as the persistence and extinction relationship depending on the parameters . to model the spatio - temporal phenomena ,",
    "a feasible approach is the combination of grid - based models and movements of individuals . in this paper",
    "we take the framework proposed by vbb as a starting point in assessing the phase transitions between the persistence and extinction rather than emergence of the stable spiral waves .",
    "we use a spatial susceptible - infected - resistant model . the population with @xmath0 individuals",
    "is categorized according to its infection status : susceptibility ( s ) , infectious ( i ) , or resistant ( r )  @xcite . within a subpopulation ,",
    "the dynamics for the local populations obey a basic reaction scheme conserving the number of population , which has been studied both in physics and mathematical epidemiology , namely the stochastic infection dynamics process identified by the following set of reactions  @xcite    [ eq : reaction ] @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3    the first reaction ( eq .  )",
    "reflects the fact that an infected host ( i ) can infect susceptible ( s ) neighbors with infection rate @xmath4 ; the second reaction ( eq .  )",
    "indicates the acquisition of resistance that hosts are infectious for a fixed period @xmath5 , after which they become resistant ( r ) ; and the third reaction ( eq .  )",
    "indicates the loss of resistance that after a fixed period @xmath6 , resistant hosts once again become susceptible . in the sense of individual / local - level model",
    ", infected hosts can infect adjacent susceptible hosts at infection rate @xmath4 . here , the infection rate is not equal the probability of infection , see  @xcite . in the short - range case ,",
    "the infectious neighborhood consists of two / eight direct nearest - neighbors ( nn ) in a 1d/2d square lattices .",
    "in addition , some recent investigations have included long - range processes in one- and two - dimensional lattice models , reporting quite different results on the occurrence of self - sustained oscillation , extinction and persistence  @xcite , as well as increasing coupling between subpopulation ( subcommunity ) in spatially structured environment can lead to population outbreaks  @xcite .",
    "thus , an understanding of the joint effect of short- and long - range interaction on the individuals ( including the mobility called as the diffusion , hopping , or stirring , hereafter , we refer as mobility ) is desirable from ecological and statistical physical point of view  @xcite .",
    "of course , in present paper , we also further study the outbreak of disease inspired stochastic lattice epidemic model with a nearest - neighbor interaction .    for ease of comparison , we follow the vbb s model by considering a regular network of sites , each of which contains one of a single susceptible individual ( s ) , an infected individual ( i ) and resistant ( r ) .",
    "the susceptibles are infected by contact with an infected host at a rate @xmath4 , and the transmission can only occur locally .",
    "every time - step @xmath7 , cells state change according to the rules in earlier studies  @xcite , which are illustrated in the corresponding eq .  .      the deterministic rate ( or mean - field ) equations describe the temporal evolution of the stochastic lattice system , defined by the reactions  , in a mean - field context ,",
    "i.e. they neglect all spatial correlations .",
    "they may be seen as a deterministic description ( for example emerging in the limit of large system sizes ) of systems without spatial structure .",
    "the study of the rate equation is the ground on which the analysis of the epidemics spreading and outbreak . in particular , the properties of the rate equations are extremely useful for the epidemics persistence by estimated values for the classical expression of @xmath8the basic reproduction number .",
    "@xmath8 is defined as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infective during its infectiousness period in an entirely susceptible population  @xcite . for the standard sirs mean - field approximation , also referred in reaction  , are as follows :    [ eq : mf ] @xmath9 @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the number of susceptibles and infected , respectively .",
    "the number of recovered individual @xmath13 is obtained by conservation of the entire population , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "the key quality describing the infection is the basic reproduction number @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 and the initial relative number of susceptibles are greater than a critical value @xmath17 , an epidemic develops ( @xmath18 ) . as the number of infected individuals increases , the number of susceptibles @xmath11 decreases , and thus the number of contacts of infected individuals with susceptibles decreases until @xmath19 , when the epidemic reaches its maximum and subsequently decays .",
    "this processes alternative again with the time going if @xmath16 .",
    "fadeout is most likely to occur in the period immediately following a major epidemic ( the so - called inter - epidemic trough ) .",
    "an important observation is that deterministic models can not reproduce such effects : the ability of populations to recover from very low levels is a well - known weakness of many deterministic models  @xcite .",
    "to begin with , we revisit some of the findings by vbb @xcite .",
    "their results then serve as a reference point for illustrating the difference of our elaborated approach from their results .",
    "this is justified by the fact that vbb only provide the spatial pattern resulting from static dispersal among individuals within single patch , as well as emergence of trade - offs between spiral waves and turbulent waves .",
    "our crucial measures are the phase transition between the global extinction and persistence of the epidemic , and the effect from the movements of individuals on it . in these simulations",
    "we set there is no migration among patches , i.e. , coupling parameter @xmath20 , in which our simulations faithfully repeat the general findings by vbb  @xcite that three types of spatial patterns emerge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) but find the differences when the mobility of individuals is turned on .      in this subsection",
    ", we analyze the relationship of infection rate and infection periodic on phase transition between global persistence and extinction within single patch . in the final subsection",
    ", we will introduce the multipatches into the spatial structure model by the coupling strength between the two patches .",
    "when the individuals are statical in the local site , then the infection only happens in the nearest neighbors , this form referred to as _",
    "local interaction_. specially , we can study the dynamics of such spatially extended model in one- or two - dimensional space by defining appropriate microscopic rules .",
    "equation   shows the explicit transition rates of cells state in space , where the susceptibles infected by infectious is isotropic .",
    "grid size used in the simulations is @xmath21 cells and time - step equals to 0.01 .",
    "larger grid sizes do not change the evolutionary dynamics ( see the computer code for the ca model at http://7y.nuc.edu.cn/jinzhen/english1.aspx ) .",
    "the persistence phase space is that the epidemics will persist when the parameters lie in this domain . here",
    ", we refer to @xmath22-parameters space .",
    "their values are determined by simulating @xmath21 cell lattices with ten independent runnings .",
    "each lattice is initially set with random occupied by 100 infected individuals .",
    "for each obtained data , we fix the infection period @xmath5 , and chose an initial infection rate @xmath4 . then , increased @xmath4 by small step ( we use @xmath23 ) and 10 thousand time units are simulated with that infection rate value to determine the critical value of the phase transition . here , we find that 10 thousand time units is a long - term run for persistence on this system . however , the typical waiting time @xmath24 until extinction occurs is generally very long when the system size @xmath0 is large .",
    "this suggests to consider the dependence of the waiting time @xmath24 on @xmath0 .",
    "quantitatively , we discriminate between persistence and extinction by using the concept of extensively , adapted from statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "if the epidemic is not extinct at that time , the pair parameters values are assumed to be within the persistence space . in the present model , we find that the epidemic will be persistence when parameter @xmath4 is between a minimal critical infection rate @xmath25 and a maximal critical infection rate @xmath26 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the definitions of persistence and extinction in the presence of absorbing states are intimately related to the concept of long - term .",
    "the threshold result for the deterministic model can be used to identify two domains in the space of essential parameters @xmath8 , namely @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where the model solutions behave in qualitatively different ways .",
    "we endeavor to describe the spatially stochastic model in a similar way , by identifying domains in the space of its essential parameters where model solutions behave in qualitatively different ways .",
    "we perform extensive computer simulations of the system   on the phase transition , which describes the persistence and extinction with respect to the @xmath22-parameters space shown in fig .",
    "[ extinction ] which also demonstrates that there exists a trade - off between infection period and infection rate . in order to compare the classic mean - field approximation of non - spatial theory @xmath8 and the spatial structure of individuals on the phase transition",
    ", we use the power laws to fit the simulation data .",
    "moreover , previous studies show that the infection rate ( @xmath4 ) and the virulence ( @xmath29 ) also have a relation of power laws on the parameters of the infection rate and virulence  @xcite . yet",

    "this has important implications , as it implies that for a wide range of @xmath34 space there are two parameter domains in the @xmath34 space .",
    "one is domain of extinction and the other is domain of persistence .",
    "this contrast with the result obtained in spatially explicit model where the parameter domain is divided into three : domains ( i ) disease free ; domain ( ii ) endemic ( see fig .  [ extinction ] ) .",

    "how does individuals mobility , in addition to nonlinearity , affect the system s behaviors ( i.e. , persistence and extinction , spatial pattern , invasion speed and so on ) ?",
    "the insight of this important issue can be gained from the cellular automata model .",
    "in particular , one can compare the results of present paper with the previous works  @xcite .",
    "two models are commonly used to predict spatial spread of a disease .",
    "the first is the distributed - contacts model , often described by a contact distribution among stationary individuals .",
    "distributed - contacts models are particularly appropriate for the study of plant disease  @xcite , but researchers are also using the closely related framework of contact networks to study disease transmission in human population  @xcite or animal species . notice that recently developing spatial moment closure methods are also based on this framework  @xcite . the second is the distributed - infectives models , often described by the mobility of infected individuals .",
    "this approach relies on the assumptions that disease is transmitted through interactions between dispersing individuals , and that infected individuals move in uncorrelated random walks .",
    "medlock and kot developed a distributed - infectives framework that uses a flexible kernel - based approach similar to that employed in distributed - contact models  @xcite .",
    "they found that inappropriate application of either the distributed - contact or distributed infectives approaches can generate inaccurate projections of epidemic spread .",
    "hence , here we consider a scenario that the transmission process involves components of both distributed - contacts and distributed infectives  diffusion of infected individuals .",
    "for instance the spread of rabies that foxes tend to be restricted to discrete home ranges . in central europe , the home range size is about 4 @xmath68 , but this may differ considerably between areas ( range 2.5 - 16 @xmath68 )  @xcite . based on previous subsection , now we investigate the individuals with a certain form of mobility .",
    "namely , at rate @xmath69 all individuals can exchange their position with a nearest neighbor .",
    "each individual randomly exchanges with its eight neighbor ( north , west , south , east , northwest , southwest , southeast , and northeast ) at each time step .",
    "this is reasonable for the realistic system .",
    "these exchange processes lead to an effective mobility of the individuals .    in this subsection",
    "we analyze the dynamics of the system by considering individual spatial diffusion process .",
    "in fact , the susceptibles mobility will also lead to the spread of the disease since it changes the spatial distribution of the infected individuals .",
    "in present paper , we consider the mobile individuals including susceptible , infected , and resistant .",
    "hereafter , we refer the terms _ exchange _ , _ mobility _ , and _ diffusion _ to as the same meaning  the mobility of individuals within nearest neighbors .",

    "we refer to the mobility as following @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
