    "in recent years a special interest in the physics of elementary particles is related with muons .",
    "experimental study of the muon anomalous magnetic moment revealed a certain discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results .",
    "the subsequent in 2010 year measurement of the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen has led to another problem , called the proton charge radius puzzle @xcite . after a new measurement of the lamb shift @xcite in muonic deuterium it became clear that there is a discrepancy in the values of the charge radius of the proton and deuteron determined by electronic and muonic atoms .",
    "this may mean that the muons are playing an important role in subatomic physics , which is not fully understood .",
    "the experimental crema collaboration program includes other muon atoms , especially muonic helium ions @xcite , but it apparently can be extended to the study of other light muonic atoms .",
    "the transition energy @xmath5 in light muonic atoms can be precisely measured by laser spectroscopy as in muonic hydrogen .",
    "therefore , additional theoretical study of muon bound states and a calculation of their energy levels , along with experimental investigations , can contribute to a better understanding of the essence of the problem .",
    "the interest in muonic ions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is also connected to the fact that , as has been established in this case , there is a strong cancelation of two main contributions to the one - loop vacuum polarization and the structure of the nucleus @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the lamb shift value lies in a wide range of wavelengths @xmath9 nm from ultraviolet to infrared region of the spectrum , making it possible for its study of laser spectroscopy methods .",
    "the measurement of transition frequencies gives an opportunity to obtain more exact information about nuclear size and structure .",
    "another important conclusion arising out of this cancelation is that a more significant role than usual , beginning to play the contributions of higher order in @xmath10 , as well as contributions containing large degrees of nuclear charge z. their methodical analysis is very important to increase the accuracy of calculation of the lamb shift @xcite . as usual ,",
    "the most important corrections in the lamb shift are the corrections to the vacuum polarization , the nuclear structure and recoil , as well as complex combination corrections to the vacuum polarization and relativism , which we explore in this paper .",
    "fundamentals of calculating of energy spectra for light muonic atoms were formulated many years ago in relativistic approach based on the dirac equation , and in nonrelativistic schrdinger method in @xcite ( see other references in review articles @xcite ) .",
    "after recent experiments of the crema collaboration in 2010 year there were many works devoted to the muonic atoms , in order to overcome the arisen difference in the magnitude of the charge radius of the proton @xcite ( see other references in @xcite ) .",
    "they carried out a new analysis of the main contribution to the lamb shift and hyperfine structure of the spectrum and the various corrections that have quite significant numerical value .",
    "there was also analyzed a number of relatively subtle effects in the fine and hyperfine structure , which however did not lead to any considerable change in the results ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend our previous calculations of the lamb shift in muonic helium ions @xcite on other muonic ions such as muonic lithium , muonic beryllium and muonic boron .",
    "we consistently calculate the contributions of orders @xmath11 within the framework of the quasipotential method in quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it is important to know also the hyperfine splitting of levels for the evaluation of observed transition frequencies @xcite . as in previous works",
    "we take modern numerical values of fundamental physical constants from @xcite .",
    "since the corrections to the structure of the nucleus play a key role further , let us write explicitly used values of the nuclear charge radii : @xmath12 fm , @xmath13 fm , @xmath14 fm , @xmath15 fm , @xmath16 fm , @xmath17 fm .",
    "let us begin by recalling the basic assumptions of the quasipotential approach in the calculation of the lamb shift .",
    "muonic ion is described by the schrdinger equation with the breit hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the muon and nucleus masses , @xmath23 , @xmath24 for nucleus with half - integer spin , @xmath25 for nucleus with integer spin .",
    "the exact solution of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath26 is then used in the calculation of the shifts of @xmath27 and @xmath28p energy levels by perturbation theory .    as is well known the basic contribution to the lamb shift in muonic atoms is determined by the effect of electron vacuum polarization ( vp ) in @xmath29-interaction .",
    "the potential of particle interaction corresponding to this effect has the form : @xmath30 it gives the shift of energy levels for @xmath27 and @xmath31 states which can be presented in analytical form ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36,\\ ] ] @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39.\\ ] ] expressions and give the following numerical values to the lamb shift in the muonic ions : @xmath40 we retain two significant figures after the decimal point in all obtained expressions .",
    "the order of contributions and is clearly extracted in front of integrals . for the calculation of muon vp contribution we use again and changing @xmath41 . corresponding numerical values which have the order @xmath42 are included in tables  [ tb1],[tb2],[tb3 ] .",
    "the two - loop vacuum polarization effects in the one - photon interaction can be divided into two parts : loop - after - loop correction ( vp - vp ) and two - loop vacuum polarization operator correction which we denote further as the `` 2-loop vp '' correction .",
    "the potential of loop - after - loop vp effect has the form @xcite : @xmath43 calculating the matrix elements of the potential in the first order perturbation theory , we find the contribution to the lamb shift of order @xmath44 : @xmath45    there is another correction to the potential which is determined by the amplitude with two sequential electron and muon loops : @xmath46.\\ ] ] it gives the correction of order @xmath47 to the lamb shift @xmath48 which is included in tables  [ tb1],[tb2],[tb3 ] .",

    "one part of three - loop vp effects with successive loops in the scattering amplitude ( loop - after - loop - after - loop , two - loop - after - loop ) can be derived as potential .",
    "corresponding contributions to the potential and the lamb shift @xmath48 are the following : @xmath56 @xmath57,\\ ] ] @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60    another part of the diagrams corresponds to the three - loop corrections to the polarization operator .",
    "they were first calculated for the @xmath48 lamb shift in muonic hydrogen in @xcite .",
    "an estimate of their contribution to the lamb shift is included in tables  [ tb1]-[tb3 ] .",
    "finally , there exists another one - loop vacuum polarization correction of order @xmath42 in the lamb shift known as the wichmann - kroll correction @xcite .",
    "its calculation was discussed repeatedly in @xcite , so we restrict ourselves here by including numerical results in the final tables as well as the whole light - by - light contribution ( see detailed calculation in @xcite ) .",
    "almost all of the corrections presented in this section are written in the integral form , and are therefore specific character for each muon atom .",
    "the presented numerical values provide important information about the change in the value of corrections in different muonic ions .",
    "the electron vacuum polarization effects modify not only the coulomb potential , but also all other terms of the breit hamiltonian .",

    "different corrections with fairly high degrees of fine structure constant @xmath4 have been taken into account .",

    "the first group includes the corrections specific to each muonic ion , which are presented in the integral form and calculated analytically and numerically .",

    "this effect is due to compensate for two basic contributions to the lamb shift from a one - loop electronic vacuum polarization and nuclear structure of order @xmath101 . as a result",
    "the corrections of higher order in @xmath10 , enhanced by nuclear charge degrees , become more important .    as noted above , the problem of the lamb shift in muonic ions of lithium , beryllium and boron",
    "was studied many years ago in @xcite .",
    "one part of results in @xcite was obtained with the use of nonrelativistic wave functions and treating the finite nuclear size and vacuum - polarization potentials as small perturbations .",

    "another part of the results in @xcite was obtained by means of numerical solution of the dirac equation and treating the remaining small corrections due to the muon self - energy , the higher - order kllen - sabrey vacuum polarization term , and nuclear polarization by perturbation theory . to compare our results with such calculation in @xcite",
    "we must take the sum of a few lines of our tables , corresponding to the first and second - order perturbation theory , and in the case of effects on the structure of the nucleus to the sum of corrections of one - photon and two - photon amplitudes .",
    "since our other corrections are numerically small , it is convenient further to compare the complete results for the lamb shift .",
    "our values of the charge radii of nuclei are slightly different from the values of @xcite , what is one of the reasons for the differences of total numerical results .",
    "another reason is related to corrections of a higher order , accounted for in this paper .",
    "for example , we use the value of the charge radius of lithium nucleus @xmath156 fm from @xcite .",
    "it is slightly different from the value 2.560 fm used in @xcite .",
    "this difference gives an addition of 82 mev to our result from table  [ tb1 ] due to structure correction of order @xmath101 . in turn , our structure correction of order @xmath106 becomes smaller on 7 mev and reduces essentially the divergence from the value of the lamb shift in @xcite .",
    "it is necessary also to point out that the nuclear charge density distribution in our work and in @xcite are slightly different .",
    "the same situation occurs for the other nuclei .",
    "note also that there is another contribution to the polarizability of the nucleus , for which we use an estimate from @xcite .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the ( -2 ) moment of the total electric - dipole photo - absorption cross section @xmath157 . in the case of light nuclei there",
    "exists a simple formula @xmath158 @xcite which allows to obtain an estimate for the cross sections of lithium , beryllium and boron .",
    "the main uncertainty of the calculation is related with nuclear structure and polarizability corrections .",
    "the errors of corresponding contributions to the lamb shift are presented explicitly in tables , where we have indicated only one total value of the lamb shift corresponding to dipole parameterization for the nuclear charge form factor .",
    "the uncertainties connected with the value of nuclear charge radius appear at the calculation of other structure corrections but they are much less basic .",
    "weak interaction contribution is very small and is not considered in this study ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , with proper experimental accuracy we can obtain more precise values of the nuclear charge radii .",
