    "1.2 cm    in recent years , a number of experimental and theoretical studies have been made to understand the decay of light di - nuclear systems ( a @xmath5 60 ) formed through low - energy ( e@xmath6 @xmath5 10 mev / nucleon ) , heavy - ion reactions . in most of the reactions",
    "studied , the properties of the observed , fully energy damped yields have been successfully explained in terms of either a fusion - fission ( ff ) mechanism or a heavy - ion resonance behavior @xcite .",
    "the strong resonance - like structures observed in elastic and inelastic excitation functions of @xmath7mg+@xmath7 mg @xcite and @xmath0si+@xmath0si @xcite have indicated the presence of shell stabilized , highly deformed configurations in the @xmath8cr and @xmath9ni compound systems , respectively . in a recent experiment using eurogam ,",
    "the present collaboration studied the possibility of preferential population of highly deformed bands in the symmetric fission channel of the @xmath9ni compound nucleus as produced through the @xmath0si+@xmath0si @xcite reaction at e@xmath10 mev .",
    "the present work aims to investigate the possible occurence of highly deformed configurations of the @xmath9ni and @xmath11ca di - nuclei produced in the @xmath0si+@xmath0si and @xmath0si+@xmath2c reactions through the study of light charged particle ( lcp ) emission . in - plane coincidences of the lcp s with both evaporation residues ( er ) and ff fragments have been measured .",
    "the lcp s emitted from ff fragments may provide informations on the deformation properties of these fragments .",
    "moreover , the in - plane angular correlations data will be used to extract the temperatures of the emitters . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the er results .",
    "1.2 cm    the experiments were performed at the ires strasbourg vivitron tandem facility using 112.6 mev @xmath0si beams on @xmath0si ( 180 @xmath12g/@xmath13 ) and @xmath2c ( 160 @xmath12g/@xmath13 ) targets .",
    "both the heavy ions and their associated lcp s were detected using the * icare * charged particle multidetector array @xcite .",
    "the heavy fragments ( er , quasi - elastic , deep - inelastic and ff fragments ) were detected in eight telescopes , each consisting of an ionization chamber ( ic ) followed by a 500 @xmath14 m si detector .",
    "the in - plane detection of coincident lcp s was done using four triple telescopes ( si 40 @xmath14 m , si 300 @xmath14 m , 2 cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward angles , 16 two - element telescopes ( si 40 @xmath14 m , 2 cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward and backward angles and two telescopes consisting of ic s followed by 500 @xmath14 m si detectors placed at the most backward angles .",
    "the ic s were filled with isobutane and the pressures were kept at 30 torr and at 60 torr for detecting heavy fragments and light fragments , respectively .",
    "typical inclusive and exclusive ( coincidence with all er s detected at 15@xmath15 ) energy spectra of @xmath4 particles at 40@xmath3 for the @xmath0si+@xmath0si reaction are shown by solid histograms in fig . 1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively .",
    "exclusive @xmath0si+@xmath2c @xmath4 spectra measured at 40@xmath3 in coincidence with s and p er s at 15@xmath16 are also displayed in fig .",
    "1.2 cm    the data analysis was performed using cacarizo , the monte carlo version of the statistical - model code cascade @xcite .",
    "the angular momenta distributions , needed as the principal input to constrain the calculations were taken from compiled @xmath0si+@xmath0si @xcite and @xmath0si+@xmath2c @xcite complete fusion data .",
    "the other ingredients for the realistic statistical - model calculations such as the nuclear level densities and the barrier transmission coefficients , are usually deduced from the study of the evaporated light particle spectra . in recent years , it has been observed in many cases that the standard statistical model can not predict the shape of the evaporated @xmath4-particle energy spectra satisfactorily @xcite , with the measured average energies of the @xmath4 particles generally much lower than the corresponding theoretical predictions .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain this anomaly either by changing the emission barrier or by using a spin - dependent level density .",
    "the change in the emission barriers and consequently the transmission probabilities affects the lower energy part of the calculated evaporation spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - energy part of the spectra depends critically on the available phase space obtained from the level densities at high spin as well as the corresponding transmission coefficients . in hot rotating nuclei formed in heavy - ion reactions",
    ", the level density at higher angular momentum should be spin dependent . the level density , @xmath17 , for a given angular momentum @xmath18 and energy @xmath19",
    "is given by the well known fermi gas expression : @xmath20^{1/2 } ) , \\label{lev}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the level density parameter , @xmath22 is the pairing correction and e@xmath23 = @xmath24j(j+1 ) is the rotational energy , @xmath25 is the effective moment of inertia , @xmath26 is the rigid body moment of inertia and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the deformation parameters @xcite .    by changing the deformation parameters one can simulate the deformation effects on the level densities .",
    "the cacarizo calculations have been performed using two sets of input parameters : one with a standard set and another with non - zero values for the deformation parameters .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "1 show the predictions of cacarizo using the standard parameter set with the usual liquid drop model deformation .",
    "it is clear that the average energies of the measured @xmath4 spectra are lower than those predicted by the standard statistical - model calculations .",
    "the dashed lines show the predictions of cacarizo using @xmath27 = 3.2 x 10@xmath29 and @xmath28 = 2.2 x 10@xmath30 .",
    "the shapes of the inclusive as well as the exclusive @xmath4 energy spectra are well reproduced after including the deformation effects .    in the case of @xmath0si+@xmath2c",
    "an interesting result is observed . in order to explain the inclusive energy spectra of @xmath4-particles it has been necessary to use the similar deformation parameters as for @xmath0si+@xmath0si system .",
    "however , it was not possible to explain the exclusive energy spectra of @xmath4 particles obtained in coincidence with all of the er s using this set .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 energy spectra have been generated in coincidence with individual s and p er s as shown in fig .",
    "the shape of the @xmath4 spectrum ( solid histograms ) obtained in coincidence with s is completely different from the spectrum obtained in coincidence with p.    the dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 are the predictions of cacarizo using non - zero values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath4 spectrum measured in coincidence with p is reasonably well reproduced by the theoretical curve .",
    "however , the model could not predict the shape of the @xmath4 spectrum obtained in coincidence with s. this is due to the fact that in this case , there may be additional contributions to the @xmath4-particle spectra from the decay of unbound @xmath31be , produced through a binary decay such as asymmetric ff and/or an orbiting mechanism with @xmath11ca @xmath32 @xmath33s+@xmath31be .",
    "this confirms the double - humped structure found in the inclusive @xmath33s velocity spectra measured by harmon et al . @xcite .",
    "the question of the real nature ( ff or orbiting ) of this decay process remains open .",
    "1.7 cm    inclusive as well as exclusive energy spectra of @xmath4-particles have been measured for the reaction @xmath0si+@xmath0si and @xmath0si+@xmath2c , respectively .",
    "the observed energy spectra of @xmath4 particles are not well reproduced by the standard statistical - model calculations with the usual liquid drop model deformation . however",
    ", a satisfactory description of the measured energy spectra has been achieved by invoking the changes in the level density and barrier due to the onset of large deformation effects at high spins .",
    "the @xmath4 spectra obtained in coincidence with s for the reaction @xmath0si + @xmath2c have an additional component which may come from the decay of @xmath31be , which is unbound and produced through the binary decay of @xmath11ca @xmath32 @xmath33s+@xmath31be .",
    "work is in progress to analyse the proton energy spectra as well as the angular correlations of both the proton and @xmath4 in - plane angular correlations .",
