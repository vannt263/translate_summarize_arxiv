    "evidence has been mounting in recent years that turbulence plays an important role in the physics of the ism as well as in governing star formation .",
    "it is believed that turbulence is responsible for generating the hierarchy of structures present across a range of spatial scales in the ism ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in such models",
    "the ism has a fractal structure and the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations is a power law , indicating that there is no preferred  cloud \" size .    on the observational front , power spectrum analysis of hi intensity fluctuations is an important technique to probe the structure of the neutral ism in galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the power spectra of the hi intensity fluctuations in our own galaxy , the lmc and the smc all show power law behavior ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) which is a characteristic of a turbulent medium .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that the hi distribution in several galaxies in the m81 group has a fractal distribution . @xcite",
    "have estimated the power spectrum of optical intensity fluctuation for the galaxies m  81 , m  51 and ngc  1365 using digitized images in different bands .",
    "the power spectra were found to show both long and short range order .",
    "further , @xcite used the fourier transform power spectra of the v and h@xmath4 images of a sample of irregular galaxies to show that the power spectra in optical and h@xmath4 pass - bands are also well fit by power laws , indicating that there is no characteristic mass or luminosity scale for ob associations and star complexes . @xcite",
    "have estimated the power spectrum of the supernovae remnants cas  a and crab .",
    "the power spectrum is found to be power law , indicating the presence of magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "recently @xcite have presented a visibility based formalism for determining the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations in galaxies with extremely weak emission .",
    "this formalism is very similar to that used for analyzing radio - interferometric observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropies @xcite .",
    "this formalism was first applied to a dwarf galaxy , ddo  210 .",
    "interestingly , the hi power spectrum of this extremely faint , largely quiescent galaxy was found to be a power law with the same slope ( @xmath5 ) as that observed in much brighter galaxies .",
    "we @xcite have applied the same technique to an external spiral galaxy ngc  628 ( m  74 ) and found a different slope @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we use the same formalism to measure the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuation for a sample of 6 more dwarf galaxies . for completeness",
    ", we also include the existing results for ddo  210 and ngc  628 , and search for correlations with other galaxy properties , e.g , the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "any detected correlation would provide insights into the nature of turbulence in the ism . in section 2",
    "we discuss the galaxies in our sample . in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the power spectrum estimator used in our work . in section 4",
    ", we perform simulations to support the analytical results obtained in section 3 .",
    "the method of analysis is discussed in section 5 . in the last section we present our results and conclusions .",
    "we briefly discuss some of the relevant properties of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "a few of the galaxy parameters are also summarized in table  [ tab : profile ] which contains - row(1 ) : type of the galaxy ; row(2 ) : distance in mpc ; row(3 ) : log[sfr ] in m@xmath7yr@xmath8 measured from h@xmath4 emission ; row(4 ) : angular extent of the galaxy calculated from moment 0 map at hi column density @xmath9 atoms  @xmath10 ; row(5 ) : velocity dispersion ( km  s@xmath8 ) , row(6 ) : inclination in hi and row(7 ) : references .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     both hi density fluctuations as well as spatial fluctuations in the velocity of the hi gas contribute to fluctuations in the hi specific intensity .",
    "considering a turbulent ism , @xcite have shown that it is possible to disentangle these two contributions by studying the behavior of the hi power spectrum as the thickness of the frequency channel is varied . if the observed hi power spectrum is due to the gas velocities , the slope of the power spectrum is predicted to decrease with increasing thickness of the frequency channel . to test this",
    "we have repeated the power spectrum analysis increasing the channel thickness @xmath11 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to @xmath12 , figures [ fig : mom0 ] and [ fig : mom01 ] , and table  [ tab : result ] also show the results for @xmath13 where the channel thickness spans the entire frequency range that has significant hi emission .",
    "we do not find a significant change in the slope of the power spectrum for any of the galaxies . since for all the galaxies",
    "the thickest channel is considerably larger than the velocity dispersion , we conclude that the hi power spectrum is purely due to density fluctuations and not gas velocities .",
    "the fact that the slope does not change with channel thickness can be used to constrain the value of @xmath14 , the slope of the velocity structure function ( eg . @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath15 values are tabulated in table  [ tab : result ] .    the galaxies in our sample have slope @xmath4 ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the two galaxies ddo  210 and ngc  3741 have slope @xmath18 , while the slope is @xmath1 for ngc  628 , ugc  4459 and and  iv , and @xmath17 for gr  8 .",
    "we have proposed a possible explanation for this dichotomy in the values of @xmath4 in @xcite .",
    "this was based on the fact that ddo  210 , where the power spectrum was measured across length - scales @xmath19 , had a slope of @xmath16 while ngc  628 , a nearly face - on galaxy where the power spectrum was measured across length - scales @xmath20 had a slope of @xmath21 .",
    "we have interpreted the former as three dimensional ( 3d ) turbulence operational at small scales whereas the latter was interpreted as two dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence in the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "for a nearly face - on disk galaxy we expect the transition from 2d to 3d turbulence to be seen at a length - scale corresponding to the scale height of the galaxy .",
    "continuing with this interpretation implies that we have also measured 3d turbulence in ngc  3741 , and 2d turbulence in ugc  4459 , gr  8 and and  iv .",
    "the power spectrum analysis can be used to determine the scale - height of nearly face - on galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite have applied this method to estimate the scale height of lmc . in a recent study @xcite",
    "we have placed an upper limit of @xmath22 for the scale - height of ngc  628 .",
    "our simulations ( section 4 ) show that we expect the slope of the hi power spectrum to change corresponding to a transition from 3d to 2d turbulence at the scale - height .",
    "the baseline @xmath23 at which this break occurs can be used to estimate the scale - height @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the distance to the galaxy .",
    "in addition to ngc  628 , our sample contains 3 more nearly face - on galaxies with @xmath26 , namely ddo  210 , ugc  4459 and gr  8 .",
    "ddo  210 has 3d turbulence across the baselines @xmath27 .",
    "the absence of a break in the power spectrum places a lower limit of @xmath28 pc on the scale - height .",
    "the galaxies ngc  628 , ugc  4459 and gr  8 exhibit 2d turbulence for the entire @xmath23 range ( table  2 ) in the measured hi power spectrum .",
    "this imposes the upper limit of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively on the scale - height .",
    "note that the scale - height of @xmath29 for ngc  628 differs from our earlier estimate @xcite because of the extra factor of @xmath32 indicated by our simulations .",
    "the energy input from star formation is believed to be a major driving force for the turbulence in the ism @xcite .",
    "hence , it is very interesting to check whether the slope of the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations in these galaxies has any correlation with the sfr .",
    "any correlation , if present , will provide an insight into the processes driving turbulence in the ism .    in a recent study @xcite calculate the sfr per unit area for 9 irregular galaxies and investigate the correlation with the v - band and h@xmath4 power spectra .",
    "the length - scales they probe are @xmath33 pc . in h@xmath4",
    "they find that the power spectra becomes steeper as the sfr per unit area increases .",
    "however they do not find any correlation in the v - band .",
    "in this paper we probe length - scales @xmath34 pc to @xmath35 kpc .",
    "we test for a possible correlation between the slope of the power spectrum and the sfr per unit area and per unit hi mass for the 5 dwarf galaxies in our sample ( figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) .",
    "we report results using the area estimated from both , the hi disk and the optical disk .",
    "the data for the sfr , angular extent , inclination in hi and hi mass for these galaxies are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sfr is determined from h@xmath4 emission , and the angular extent in hi is determined from the moment0 maps at a column density of @xmath9 atoms  @xmath10 . for the angular extent and inclination of the optical disk",
    "we use the parameters from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient is found to have values @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the hi and optical disks respectively , indicating the absence of any correlation between the slope of the power spectrum and the sfr per unit area .",
    "we have similar result for sfr per unit hi mass for these 5 galaxies .",
    "however , we note a few points that should be taken into consideration when interpreting this conclusion .",
    "the h@xmath4 emission is not a good tracer of sfr in low mass galaxies due to stochastic star formation @xcite .",
    "also , the length - scales across which the power spectrum has been estimated for the dwarf galaxies in our sample are substantially larger than the optical disk where star formation occurs .",
    "turbulence can also possibly be related to different parameters of the galaxy .",
    "we test for correlations between the slope of the hi power spectrum and the following parameters : total hi mass , hi mass to light ratio , total dynamical mass , total baryonic mass , gas fraction , baryon fraction .",
    "we use the estimates of these observable quantities from @xcite . in all the cases the linear correlation coefficient",
    "is found to lie between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , indicating the absence of correlation .    in the above analysis we have considered galaxies with both 2d and 3d turbulence taken together , which in turn can suppress the correlations .",
    "hence , we further investigated the correlations by considering the 4 galaxies in our sample ( including ngc  628 ) with 2d turbulence . in this case",
    "the correlation coefficient comes out to be -0.70 and -0.74 for sfr per unit area of optical and hi disks respectively .",
    "this indicates a strong correlation and the result is similar to that of @xcite , namely that the surface density of star formation rate is larger for galaxies with steeper hi power spectrum .",
    "these findings indicate a possible link between star formation and the nature of turbulence in the ism",
    ". however , it would not be realistic to speculate on a possible cause and effect relation between these two .",
    "it is quite possible that the observed correlation is an outcome of extraneous factors which influence both .",
    "finally , we note that the total number of galaxies in all of our analysis is rather small for a statistical conclusion .",
    "a larger galaxy sample is required for a better understanding of the generic features , if any , of turbulence in the ism of faint dwarf galaxies .",
