    "the occurrence of rare events can vastly contribute to the evolution of physical systems because of their potential dramatic effects .",
    "their understanding has gathered a strong interest and , focusing on stochastic dynamics , a large variety of numerical methods have been developed to study their properties .",
    "they range from transition path sampling  @xcite to `` go with the winner '' algorithms  @xcite and discrete - time  @xcite or continuous - time  @xcite population dynamics ( see  @xcite for a review ) , and they have been generalized to many contexts  @xcite . in physics , those are being increasingly used in the study of complex systems , for instance in the study of current fluctuations in models of transport  @xcite , glasses  @xcite , protein folding  @xcite and signalling networks  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the procedure amounts to determining a large deviation function ( ldf ) associated to the distribution of a given trajectory - dependent observable , which in turns can be reformulated in finding the ground state of a linear operator ( see  @xcite for a recent review of many aspects of this correspondence ) .",
    "in fact , this question is common to both statistical and quantum physics , and the very origin of population dynamics methods lies in the quantum monte - carlo algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the idea of population dynamics is to translate the study of a class of rare trajectories ( with respect to a determined global constraint ) into the evolution of several copies of the original dynamics , with a local - in - time selection process rendering the occurrence of the rare trajectories typical in the evolved population .",
    "the decay or growth of the population is in general exponential , at a rate which is directly related to the distribution of the class of rare trajectories in the original dynamics . two versions of such algorithms exist : the non - constant total population and the constant total population , for which a uniform pruning / cloning is applied on top of the cloning dynamics so as to avoid the exponential explosion or disappearance of the population . while the later version is obviously more computer - friendly , the former version presents interesting features : first , it is directly related to the evolution of biological systems ( stochastic jumps representing mutations , selection rules being interpreted as darwinian pressure ) ; second , the uniform pruning / cloning of the population , although unbiased , induces correlations in the dynamics that one might want to avoid ; last , in some situations where the selection rates are very fluctuating , the constant - population algorithm can not be used in practice because of finite - population effects ( population being wiped out by a single clone ) , and one has to resort to the non - constant one .    in this article ,",
    "we focus on the non - constant population algorithm , that we study numerically in a simple model where its implementation and its properties can be examined in great details . in section  [ the cloning algorithm and the large deviation function ] ,",
    "we recall for completeness the relation between large deviations and the precise population dynamics . in section",
    "[ sec : avepopldf ] we describe issues related to the averaging of distinct runs , that we quantify in section  [ parallel behaviour in log - populations ] . in section  [ sec : time_correct ] we propose a new method to increase the efficiency of the population dynamics algorithm by applying a realization - dependent time delay , and we present the results of its application in section  [ sec : psi_timedelay ] .",
    "we characterize numerically the distribution of these time delays in section  [ sec : time - delay - prop ] .",
    "our conclusions and perspectives are gathered in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a method commonly used in order to determine the large deviation function is the so - called `` cloning algorithm ''  @xcite .",
    "this method has its origin in the study of continuous - time markov chains and their dynamics . in this section",
    "we make a review of the theoretical background behind the algorithm , of how populations are generated and of how the ldf is evaluated .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of possible configurations of a system which evolves continuously in time with jumps from @xmath1 to @xmath2 occurring at transition rate @xmath3 .",
    "the probability @xmath4 to find the system at time @xmath5 in configuration @xmath1 evolves in time following the master equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the escape rate from configuration @xmath1 .",
    "if we define an additive observable @xmath8 over trajectories of the system ( extensive in time , such as the number of configuration changes along the trajectory ) , which increases by an amount @xmath9 each time the system changes from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , the probability @xmath4 can be detailed into @xmath10 .",
    "this probability is defined as the probability of finding the system at time @xmath5 in the configuration @xmath1 and with a value @xmath8 of the observable . in this case",
    "@xmath11 we can bias the statistical weight of histories by introducing a parameter @xmath12 which fixes the average value of @xmath8 , such that @xmath13 favors its non - typical values ( @xmath14 characterizes the non - biased case ) and for @xmath15 ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are the `` @xmath12-modified '' rates . this new stochastic process is called `` @xmath12-modified dynamics '' and can be conveniently rewritten as @xmath18 \\hat{p}(c , s , t)\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) can be seen as the evolution equation of the ( non - conserved ) probability @xmath21 with rates @xmath22 , supplemented with a population dynamics where configurations are multiplied at a rate @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the conjunction of these `` mutation '' and `` selection '' processes constitutes the cloning algorithm .",
    "the first term of the rhs conserves the probability while the second term represents the creation or destruction of clones of the system .",
    "the non - probability preserving `` selection '' process allows to render typical in the @xmath13 biased dynamics an atypical class of histories of the original @xmath24 process .",
    "a detailed description of the corresponding cloning algorithm is given below .",
    "consider @xmath25 clones of the system ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath25 copies of the system initially in the same configuration @xmath1 ) .",
    "the dynamics is continuous in time and described by the times of configuration changes .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the times at which each of the clones @xmath27 will evolve .    1 .",
    "the first clone to evolve corresponds to the clone @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath28 changes its configuration from @xmath1 to @xmath2 with probability @xmath30 3 .",
    "@xmath28 is replaced by @xmath31 copies , where @xmath32 is the cloning factor and @xmath33 is a random number uniformly distributed on @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the next evolution of each copy @xmath28 will occur at @xmath35 where @xmath36 is chosen from a exponential law of parameter @xmath37 , and is drawn independently for every copy .",
    "5 .   if @xmath38 , @xmath28 is erased .",
    "if @xmath39 , we make @xmath40 copies of @xmath28 .    the repetition of this procedure will result ( after an enough time ) in an exponential growth ( or decay ) of the number of clones .",
    "we restrict for simplicity our study to situations were the ldf is positive and the population thus increases in time . we can keep track of the different changes in the number of clones and of the times where these changes occur and we will denote by @xmath41 the time - dependent population . once we have generated @xmath41 , we can compute the ldf from the slope in time of the log - population @xmath42 , which constitutes an evaluation of the population growth rate .",
    "this can be done in different ways , for example by fitting @xmath43 by @xmath44 and taking the ldf as @xmath45 or also by computing @xmath46 from @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the maximum and minimum values for @xmath41 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 their respective times",
    ". we will refer later to this procedure as the `` bulk '' slope estimator of the ldf .",
    "note that in some situations one can extend the previously described algorithm to keep population constant , by uniformly pruning or cloning the copies at each step so as to effectively preserve the total population size without biasing its evolution .",
    "however , we are interested in situations where such approach can not be applied in practice , for instance when the cloning rate is highly fluctuating .      throughout this article",
    "we focus our attention on a toy system where population discreteness can be studied simply : the birth and death process in one site .",
    "the system presents two states @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the transition rates read @xmath54 and @xmath55 so that equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) for this process becomes @xmath56 additionally , for our purposes , we will consider as additive observable @xmath8 the activity @xmath57 for which @xmath58 : @xmath57 represents the total number of configuration changes up to final time @xmath5 .",
    "an advantage of considering this process for our analysis is that the large deviation function for the activity can be determined analytically .",
    "the large - time cumulant generating function @xmath59 , also corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue of following matrix ( see equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) ) @xmath60 which it is found to be @xmath61{1 - 4c(1-c)(1-e^{-2s})}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) will allow us to assess the quality of our numerical results .",
    "the inverse of the difference between the eigenvalues of @xmath62 @xmath63 allows us to define the typical convergence time @xmath64 to the large time behaviour for equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned before , the cloning algorithm results ( as time goes to infinity ) in an exponential growth ( for @xmath65 ) or decay ( for @xmath66 ) of the number of clones .",
    "as we will see later , the `` discreteness effects '' in the evolution of our populations are strong at initial times .",
    "that is why the determination of the ldf using this algorithm is constrained not only to the parameters @xmath67 , the initial number of clones @xmath68 and the number of realizations @xmath69 but also to the final time ( or the maximum population ) until which the process evolves in the numerical procedure .    in order to obtain an accurate estimation of  @xmath46",
    ", we should average several realizations of the procedure described in section  [ populations and the large deviation function ] . to perform this average",
    ", we will define below a procedure that we have called `` merging '' which will allow us to determine in a systematic way the average population from which we can obtain an estimation of the ldf  @xmath46 .",
    "noteworthy , this erroneously could be seen as obtaining  @xmath46 from the growth rate of the average ( or equivalently the sum ) of several runs of the population dynamics .",
    "this procedure would be incorrect since it amounts to performing a single run of the total population of the different runs , with a dynamics that would partition the total population into _ non - interacting _ sub - populations , while , as described in section  [ populations and the large deviation function ] , the population dynamics induces effective interactions among the whole set of copies inside the population .",
    "in fact , the right way of performing this numerical estimate comes from computing  @xmath46 from the average growth rate of several runs of the population _",
    "i.e. _ , from taking the average @xmath70 of the slopes of several @xmath71 instead of the slope of @xmath72 .",
    "the two results differ in general since @xmath73 .",
    "one can expect that the two results become equivalent in the large @xmath68 limit as the distribution of growth rate should become sharply concentrated around its average value ; however , they are different in the finite @xmath68 regime that we are interested in .",
    "let s consider @xmath74 populations @xmath75 .",
    "the average population is defined as @xmath76 . in order to compute @xmath77",
    ", we introduce a procedure that we have called `` merging '' of populations which is described below .    given",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 the result of merging these two populations @xmath80 is another population @xmath81 which represents the total number of clones for each time where a change in population for @xmath82 and @xmath83 has occurred .",
    "if @xmath84 is the average population for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the merged population and the average population are related through @xmath85 .",
    "if we add , for example , to our previous result another population @xmath86 , the result @xmath87 is related to the average by @xmath88 .",
    "these `` merging '' procedure can be done for each of the populations in @xmath89 so that @xmath90=\\mathcal{m}(\\mathcal{m}(\\mathcal{m}( ...",
    "(\\mathcal{m}(\\mathcal{m}(n_{1},n_{2}),n_{3}),n_{4}), ... ),n_{j-1}),n_{j})\\ ] ] is the result of systematically merging all the populations in @xmath89 .",
    "the average population @xmath77 can be recovered from @xmath91 $ ] as @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "similarly , in the case of log - populations , @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 ) is obtained from merging all the populations in @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath46 is then computed from the slope of @xmath96 with @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "issues can emerge in the determination of @xmath46 which are not only related to the dependence of the method in @xmath25 ( the initial number of clones ) and @xmath74 ( the number of populations ) . at initial times",
    "there is a wide distribution of times at which the first series of jumps occurs .",
    "this means that fluctuations at initial times induce that some populations remain in their initial states longer than others , producing an effective delay compared to other populations that evolve faster in their initial regime . from a practical point of view",
    ", this can induce that the numerical determination of @xmath46 becomes a slow and inefficient task .",
    "one way of dealing with this issue comes from restricting the evolution of @xmath89 up to a maximum time @xmath50 or a maximum population @xmath48 .",
    "however , this implies that if @xmath50 or @xmath48 are not long enough , the determination of @xmath46 will be strongly affected by the behaviour of @xmath89 at initial times .",
    "we now discuss two issues that are encountered in the numerical evaluation of the ldf : ( i ) the influence of how the dynamics is halted ; and ( ii ) the role of initial population in the initial regime .",
    "let s call @xmath98 the set of final times of @xmath89 , with @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 depends on @xmath102 whenever the simulation is stopped at @xmath48 ( as in figure  [ fig : merge ] ) or at @xmath50 .",
    "this due to the fact the algorithm is continuous in time and the last @xmath103 does not exactly lead to @xmath50 .",
    "we say that the average population @xmath77 represents @xmath89 only if the average is made in the interval @xmath104 $ ] where all the populations are defined .",
    "in other words , the average population in this interval takes into consideration all the populations while for times @xmath105 some populations have stopped evolving .",
    "this phenomenon is especially evident when considering a maximum population limit @xmath48 for the evolution of the populations ( figure  [ fig : merge](a ) ) . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath77 depends on the distribution of final times of @xmath89 which are not necessarily equal to @xmath50 .",
    "+    an alternative that can be considered in order to overcome the influence of initial discreteness effects in the determination of @xmath46 is to get rid of the initial transient regime where these effects are present . in other words , to cut the initial time regime of our populations .",
    "let s call @xmath106 the initial cut in log - populations and equivalently @xmath107 the initial cut in times .",
    "@xmath108 is the distribution of times at @xmath109 . in that case , similarly as we analysed before , the average population @xmath77 represents @xmath89 only if the average is made in the interval @xmath110 $ ] which can be in fact very small and could result in a bad approximation of @xmath46 ( figure  [ fig : merge](b ) ) .",
    "as we will see in the next section , log - populations after a long enough time become parallel _ i.e. _ , once the populations have overcome the discreteness effects regime , the distance between them is constant .",
    "we will use this fact in order to propose a method which allows us to overcome the problems we have described in this section . throughout this article",
    ", we consider for our simulations @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "given @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we define the distance between these populations at @xmath116 ( with @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) , as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the time interval @xmath121 spent at @xmath116 and @xmath122 is the time where @xmath121 changes to @xmath116 .",
    "evidently there are cases where @xmath123 but @xmath118 , @xmath117 but @xmath124 and @xmath123 and @xmath124 , however @xmath125 for these cases can also be computed . the last analysis ( and definitions )",
    "is also valid for log - populations . @xmath125 and",
    "@xmath126 enjoy interesting properties that we discuss below .",
    "+      in figure  [ fig : distance1 ] , we show two log - populations and the distance between them .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : distance1](a ) log - populations after a long enough time become parallel _ i.e. _ , once the populations have overcome the discreteness effects , the distance between them becomes constant as can be seen in figure  [ fig : distance1](b ) .",
    "the region where the distance between populations is constant characterizes the exponential regime of the populations growth , _",
    "i.e. _ , the region where the discreteness effects are not strong anymore .     +    if we consider some population @xmath128 as reference , using the definitions above , it is possible to determine the distance @xmath129 between @xmath130 and the rest of populations in @xmath131 . in figure",
    "[ fig : distance2](a ) we show their average @xmath132 in light blue and its average over @xmath133 realizations @xmath134_{r}$ ] in dark blue .",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ the cloning algorithm and the large deviation function ] , the parameter @xmath12 characterizes atypical behaviours of the unbiased dynamics , and this induces a dependence in @xmath12 of the population growth .",
    "a population with a large value of @xmath12 corresponds to a large deviation of @xmath57 .",
    "also , as it is clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : distance2](b ) , the time of entrance of the system into a regime free of discreteness effects depends on @xmath12 .",
    "based on the results we just illustrated , we propose a method in order to improve the approximation of @xmath46 and reduce the influence of the initial discrete population size regime we described in subsection  [ discreteness effects at initial times ] .",
    "we aim at giving more weight to the exponential regime in the determination of @xmath46 .",
    "as we will see below , this can be done through a delay in the evolution of populations .",
    "consider @xmath74 populations @xmath89 , their respective log - populations @xmath135 and their distribution of final times @xmath136 .",
    "we define as  delay \" @xmath137 of @xmath138 ( with respect to a fixed reference population @xmath128 ) the time interval    @xmath139    such that , if @xmath140 , @xmath138 is ahead with respect to @xmath130 , and if @xmath141 , @xmath138 is delayed with respect to @xmath130 .",
    "this lag can be compensated by performing on @xmath138 the time translation    @xmath142    which produces that @xmath143 and @xmath130 share not only the final population @xmath48 but also the same final time @xmath144 . moreover , considering also the fact that log - populations are parallel at large times , this procedure produces that @xmath143 and @xmath130 overlap in the region that we have called free of discreteness effects .",
    "the result of performing this transformation to all the populations in @xmath135 is shown in figure  [ fig : delayedpop ] .",
    "+    figure  [ fig : delayedpop ] also illustrates many of the points we have discussed up to now .",
    "one of them is related to the `` wide '' distribution of final times , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath145 and @xmath146 can be very distant one from each other .",
    "this along with the fact that the average population depends on @xmath145 makes that the determination of @xmath46 omits a considerable region where the populations have already entered the exponential regime .",
    "this implies precisely that more weight is given to the initial discreteness effects than to the exponential regime .",
    "these effects are in fact present up to relatively long times which means that if we would like to get rid of the region were discreteness effects are strong by cutting the populations , the determination of @xmath46 would be restricted to the interval @xmath110 $ ] . by applying precisely this time delay correction to @xmath135",
    "we solve these two problems .",
    "first , we give more importance precisely to the region where the population growth is exponential .",
    "second , we omit naturally the very first initial times of the evolution of our populations .",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ sec : bdp ] , the inverse of the difference between the eigenvalues of @xmath62 ( equation  ( [ eq : ws ] ) ) @xmath64 allows us to define the typical convergence time to the large time behaviour for equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "a crucial remark is that , as observed numerically , the duration before the population enters into the exponential regime is in fact larger than the time scale given by the gap : for instance , for the parameters used to obtain figure  [ fig : delayedpop ] , from equation  ( [ eq : tgap ] ) one has @xmath147 .",
    "the understanding of the duration of this discreteness effects regime would require a full analysis of the finite - population dynamics and its associated discreteness effects , which are not fully understood .",
    "we propose in this section a numerical procedure to reduce its influence .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : delayedpop ] , and as it is proved in figure  [ fig : varlogpop ] , the variance of log - populations ( black ) increases as a function of the time , faster during the transient regime , and slower during the exponential growth regime until the variance becomes constant .",
    "after the time - delay correction , the variance of the delayed log - population ( blue ) decreases to zero as a function of time .",
    "the @xmath12-dependent decrease rate is shown in figure  [ fig : varlogpop](b ) .",
    "as we discussed in section  [ populations merging ] , the large deviation function @xmath46 can be recovered from the slope in time of the logarithm of the average population .",
    "we also mentioned in section  [ discreteness effects at initial times ] , an alternative we can consider to overcome the discreteness effects would be to eliminate the initial transient regime where these effects are strong .",
    "as we will synthesize later , the improvement in the estimation of @xmath46 comes precisely from these two main contributions , the time delaying of populations and the discarding of the initial transient regime of the populations .",

    "@xmath149 is obtained through a time delay procedure over @xmath135 , as was described above .",

    "however if we rescale the distributions of time delays by their respective @xmath189 , as shown in figure  [ fig : histogram](b ) , the distributions become independent of @xmath12 as @xmath190 \\hat{p } \\left(\\frac{\\delta \\tau } { \\sigma_{s } \\left[\\delta\\tau \\right]}\\right)$ ] .",
    "this provides a strong numerical evidence supporting the existence of a universal distribution @xmath191 .",
    "in this paper we analysed the discreteness effects at initial times in population dynamics . during the initial transient regime of the evolution of populations",
    ", there is a wide distribution of times at which the first series of jumps occurs .",
    "this means that fluctuations at initial times produce that some populations remain in their initial states for much longer than others , producing a gap in their individual evolution .",
    "this induces a relative shift that lasts forever .",
    "these effects play an important role specially for the determination of the large deviation function which may be obtained from the growth rate of the average log - population ( section  [ the cloning algorithm and the large deviation function ] ) .",
    "however , in section  [ discreteness effects at initial times ] we saw how by restricting the evolution of our populations up to a maximum time @xmath50 ( or population @xmath48 ) which is not `` large enough '' , the average population ( and @xmath46 ) is strongly affected by the behaviour of @xmath89 at initial times .",
    "we proposed as an alternative to overcome the influence of initial discreteness effects to get rid of the regions of the populations where these effects are present .",
    "in other words , to cut the initial transient regime of the populations . in that case , we saw that the average of populations is restricted to the interval @xmath110 $ ] which can be in fact very small and this can induce a poor estimation of @xmath46 ( figure  [ fig : merge](b ) ) .",
    "complementary to this , we found a way of emphasizing the effects of the exponential growth regime in the determination of @xmath46 by using the fact that log - populations after a long enough time become parallel ( figure  [ fig : distance1](a ) ) and that once the populations have overcome the discreteness effects , the distance between them becomes constant ( figure  [ fig : distance1](b ) ) and the discreteness effects are not strong anymore ( section  [ parallel behaviour in log - populations ] ) .",
    "we argue in section  [ time delay correction ] that this initial discreteness effects or initial `` lag '' between populations could be compensated by performing over the populations a time translation ( equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) ) .",
    "this time delay procedure is chosen so as to overlap the population evolutions in their large - time regime ( figure  [ fig : delayedpop](b ) ) .",
    "the improvement in the estimation of @xmath152 comes precisely from these two main contributions , the time delaying of populations and the discarding of the initial transient regime of the populations .",
    "we showed how the the numerical estimations for the ldf are improved as the initial instances of the populations are discarded ( independently of the method used to compute the growth rate of the average population , see figure  [ fig : psi2 ] ) .",
    "also , it is was shown that if additionally , we perform the time delay procedure , the estimation of @xmath152 is improved even more and closer to the theoretical value ( section  [  bulk \" and  fit \" slopes ] ) .",
    "this result was confirmed later in section  [ relative distance and estimator error ] by computing the relative distance of the numerical estimators with respect to the theoretical value and their errors . as we observed ( figure  [ fig : relatived ] ) , the deviation from the theoretical value is higher for values of @xmath12 close to @xmath52 , but is smaller after the `` time correction '' for almost every value of @xmath12 .",
    "similarly for the error estimator ( figure  [ fig : error ] ) .",
    "our numerical study was performed on a simple system , and we hope it can be extended to more complex phenomena",
    ". however , there remain open questions even for the death - and - birth system we have studied . the duration of the initial discrete - population regime could be understood from an analytical study of the population dynamics itself .",
    "our numerical results also support a power - law behaviour in time of the variance of the delays .",
    "furthermore , it appeared that the distribution of the delays takes a universal form , after rescaling the variance to one .",
    "those observations open questions for future studies .",
