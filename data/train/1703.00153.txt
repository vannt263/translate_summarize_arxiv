    "although most of the experimental measurements are in good agreement with the standard model ( sm ) predictions , there are still some unexplained discrepancies and theoretical issues that the sm can not solve@xcite .",
    "so the sm is generally regarded as an effective realization of an underlying theory to be yet discovered .",
    "the small but non - vanishing neutrino masses , the hierarchy and naturalness problems provide a strong motivation for contemplating new physics ( np ) beyond the sm at tev scale , which would be in an energy range accessible at the lhc .",
    "many extensions of the sm contain hidden sectors .",
    "these corresponding hidden particles are uncharged under the sm gauge group , and can be natural candidates of dark matter .",

    "they can explain the generation of strong cp violation and neutrino mass .",
    "these coupling operators give us an opportunity to probe the hidden world . in this work",

    "the first and second matrices are used to diagonalize the mass terms and the third matrix is used to canonically normalize the kinetic terms .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 are sine and cosine of the new mixing angle @xmath37 given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the masses of the sm boson @xmath34 and the dark boson before mixing . after the above rotating",
