    "in the late 1940s a `` big bang '' theory of nucleosynthesis was postulated by george gamow and his students , ralph alpher and robert herman . in 1948 ,",
    "alpher and herman used this theory to predict a blackbody background with a present temperature of about @xmath5 .",
    "similar calculations were done with similar results by ya .",

    "taylor in 1964 .",
    "independent of the above calculations , p.j.e .",
    "peebles argued in 1965 that there ought to be a blackbody background of radio noise left over from the early universe , red shifted to a present temperature of about @xmath6 .",
    "peebles based his argument on the fact that if there had not been an intense radiation field during the initial few minutes of the expanding universe , that nucleosynthesis would have proceeded at such a rate that a substantial amount of the primordial hydrogen would have been fused into heavier elements",
    ". this would be in direct conflict with the fact that roughly 75 percent of the observed baryonic matter of the universe is hydrogen .",
    "the intense radiation field was needed in order to prevent the hydrogen nuclei from fusing .",
    "this radiation field would have survived , albeit at lower and lower temperatures as the universe continued to expand .",
    "therefore this radiation would be present today and if there had been no interaction of the radiation field with other constituents of the universe , the radiation field would be isotropic , homogeneous and a perfect blackbody . in 1964 , arno penzias and robert wilson discovered this relic radiation field using a 20 foot horn reflector antenna located on crawford hill at holmdale , new jersey .    since 1965",
    "a variety of experiments have been performed in order to confirm that penzias and wilson actually observed the relic radiation of the big bang .",
    "it is hypothesized that this relic radiation , with a temperature of @xmath7 , would be dominate in the wavelength range @xmath8 .",
    "the wavelength at which the maximum intensity would occur is found from the wien displacement law @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately this entire range of wavelengths is not observable from the earth s surface .",
    "molecular absorption bands in the earth s atmosphere prevent observations at wavelengths less than @xmath12 . rocket borne instruments",
    "are needed to observe the wien tail of the relic radiation .",
    "a number of groups have measured the intensity of the relic radiation and have found it to be remarkably isotropic ( discounting the dipole moment observed because of our galaxy s peculiar motion in the direction of the virgo cluster of galaxies ) , and well fit by a blackbody _ except _ in the wien tail of the spectrum , @xmath13 .",
    "this data is shown in table  [ cmbr ] below . as seen in table  [ cmbr ] ,",
    "measurements of @xmath14 , with the exception of the cobe data , indicate a considerable short - wavelength excess in the cosmic microwave background radiation , cmbr .",
    "many attempts were made to explain blackbody distortions of this type , including :    1 .",
    "very early superstars or hypercactive protogalaxies released extraordinary amounts of radiant energy that was then reradiated in the infrared by a prodigious density of cosmic dust .",
    "2 .   a hot igm would compton scatter photons off of energetic electrons and thereby raise the photon energy .",
    "it should be noted that in both scenarios above , the parameters of the model have been adjusted in order to provide a `` best fit '' for the observations .",
    "the first model has great difficulty in providing the necessary energy and amount of dust to fit the observed excess .",
    "the second model is easier to formulate and match to the observations .",
    "however this model requires that all of the baryonic mass of the universe be contained in the igm , _ eg .",

    "this is in direct conflict with the constraint on @xmath17 by primordial nucleosynthesis , steigman ( 1989 ) , @xmath18 .",
    "the claim made by tw that primordial nucleosynthesis constraints are `` not in strong conflict with our results since extrapolation from current d ( deuterium ) abundance measurements back to primordial abundances is somewhat uncertain since it depends sensitively on the amount of stellar processing , and therefore on galactic and stellar evolution models .

    "however , the former is needed to estimate the mass of a cloud since the cloud is mostly ionized .",
    "the ionized and neutral hydrogen number densities are related through a simple ionization balance equation @xmath21 where @xmath0 and @xmath22 are the recombination coefficient and photoionization rate , respectively .",
    "the clouds are much larger than the angular diameter of the qso .",

    "the baryonic mass budget of the universe remains an open question .",
    "studies of primordial nucleo synthesis , steigman ( 1989 ) , show that the fraction of the critical density contained in baryons is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the uncertainty in the hubble parameter , @xmath50",

    "results from the previous section indicate that the baryonic mass contained in the lyman-@xmath0 clouds is @xmath54 the lyman-@xmath0 clouds have been extensively studied .",
    "peterson ( 1978 ) and sargent _ et al . _  ( 1980 ) have shown that these clouds : are not associated with galaxies as evidenced by the lack of clustering , have low metal abundance and exist in large numbers .",
    "they are inter - galactic in nature and of primordial abundances .",
    "they are thought to be confined by pressure equilibrium with the rest of the igm , @xmath55 .",
    "we now assume that the remainder of the baryonic mass , as indicated by primordial nucleosynthesis , is contained in the rest of the igm , @xmath56 .",
    "since the igm is also of primordial abundance , the number density of the igm is @xmath57 the above equations can be evaluated for @xmath58 @xmath59    a lower limit can be set on the temperature of the igm , at @xmath1 , by choosing the minimum mass in the luminous matter , @xmath60 and assuming pressure equilibrium with the lyman-@xmath0 clouds @xmath61 with @xmath49 , @xmath62 at @xmath1 .",
    "the lack of observed neutral hydrogen , gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) , indicates that if the igm exists , beyond lyman-@xmath0 systems , it is ionized and hot as indicated by the above temperature relationship .",
    "we now seek solutions to the temperature - redshift relation for the igm . the temperature of the igm at any epoch will directly affect the interaction of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) with the hot electrons of the igm .",
    "we have already established the temperature of the igm at the epoch @xmath1 , and this will be used as a boundary condition for the temperature - redshift relation as a function of redshift .    consider the universe as a closed system and any expansion or contraction is consequently adiabatic .",
    "therefore solutions with constant entropy are desired for the thermal history of the igm .",

    "non - relativistic expansion indicates that @xmath67 , and since the volume scales as @xmath68 , the temperature scales as @xmath69 , and the case of cooling a non - relativistic gas by adiabatic expansion is solved , field & perrenod ( 1977 ) , hereafter fp .        .",
    "note that at low @xmath98 , _ i.e. _  non - relativistic temperatures , @xmath99 and the average kinetic energy is @xmath100 . for large @xmath98 ,",
    "_ i.e. _  relativistic temperatures , @xmath101 and the average kinetic energy is @xmath102 .",
    "the transition between the two limits is smooth , `` nature abhors sharp corners , '' professor of physics emeritus stan christensen , kent state university . ]",
    "the derivative of energy with respect to temperature ( needed for the entropy per particle calculation ) is @xmath103 the volume may be eliminated from eq .",
    "( [ electron ] ) by @xmath104 . then eq .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) is used to integrate eq .",
    "( [ electron ] ) to define the entropy per particle for both relativistic and non - relativistic adiabatic cooling by expansion .",
    "an additional source of cooling for the electron gas in the igm is from inverse compton scattering of cmbr photons off of hot igm electrons .",
    "the change in entropy with respect to redshift from inverse compton scattering is @xmath105 the compton power loss per scattering , rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) , is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the thompson scattering cross section , @xmath108 has its usual relativistic meanings , @xmath109 is as defined before , and @xmath110 is the initial photon energy density , in this case the undisturbed cmbr , @xmath111 , where @xmath14 is the photon temperature .",
    "therefore we can write the entropy change for one electron due to inverse compton scattering as @xmath112    setting @xmath113 implies @xmath114 . the power loss per electron",
    "is averaged over the electron distribution @xmath115 where the substitution @xmath116 , as the cmbr photons are always relativistic .",
    "the integral is evaluated to be @xmath117    the total entropy per particle of the igm is then @xmath118 the temperature @xmath98 required to hold eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) constant is found as a function of redshift .",
    "this defines the temperature - redshift relationship for the igm , figure [ history ] .",
    "also shown in figure [ history ] is the case for non - relativistic expansion and the model calculated by tw .",
    "the boundary conditions in figure [ history ] are @xmath119 at @xmath1 , as found previously ( lower limit ) , and @xmath120 as an intermediate value .",
    "the difference between this work and tw is evident in figure [ history ] .",
    "the differences result from the boundary conditions .",
    "tw chose @xmath121 in order to fit the observed x ray background .",
    "this work calculates @xmath121 from pressure equilibrium between the lyman-@xmath0 cluds and the constraints on the fractional mass contained in baryons by primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is clearly evident that the model proposed by tw would have a substantially greater effect upon the cmbr than the model presented here .    , for different initial temperatures @xmath98 .",
    "also shown is the model proposed by tw and the temperature from purely non - relativistic adiabatic expansion . ]",
    "we have previously shown that the igm , if it exists , is hot and optically thin .",
    "inverse compton scattering , an efficient cooling mechanism for the igm , also redistributes energy from the hot electrons to the photons of the cmbr .",
    "the redistribution of energy will in turn change the distribution in frequency of the photon gas , hence distorting the blackbody spectrum of the relic radiation .",
    "the effect is most noticeable in the wien tail of the spectrum , and many authors have previously calculated this distortion in efforts to understand the reported excess in the wien tail of the cmbr .",
    "therefore this work is not unique in method , but because of the vastly different thermal history of the igm presented in the previous section as compared to other author s efforts ( most notable tw and fp ) , our calculated distorted cmbr is correspondingly different , albeit of the same nature as tw and fp .",
    "the reader is directed to tw for a superb description of the methodology for calculating the distortion of the cmbr , it will not be reproduced here .",
    "only the results will be reported .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ cobe ] .",
    "three different models are shown in figure [ cobe ] corresponding to different epochs when radiation from qsos first ionized the igm .",
    "these models are model 1  @xmath122 , model 2  @xmath123 , and model 3  @xmath124 .",
    "the models start by adjusting the initial temperature of the cmbr so that the output temperature of the distorted cmbr is @xmath125 k in the range 1 cm @xmath126 0.05 cm , to correlate to cobe90 .",
    "( this is done only to show that the results of cobe90 do not disallow a hot igm . )",
    "previous authors have adjusted the density and temperature of the igm in order to model the cosmic x ray background and the highly distorted cmbr by matsumoto _",
    "et al . _  ( 1988 ) .",
    "the initial scope of this work was to adjust the parameter @xmath4 in order to present a model of the igm that also matched the results of previous measurements of the cmbr , discounting cobe90 .",
    "the preliminary results of cobe90 have changed the path of this work . whereas it has been boldly stated that cobe90 has shown there is not a hot ( ionized ) igm ,",
    "the results shown here show that cobe90 data is inconclusive as to the existence of the hot igm .",
    "the cobe90 results do put limits on the parameter space of temperature and density of the igm as evidence by figure [ cobe ] .",
    "a hot , thin igm may still exist , but certainly not to the extent as to be the source of the cosmic x ray background as has been previously postulated , tw and fp .    .",
    "the models differ in the epoch at which the radiation from qsos first ionized the igm , these are model 1  @xmath122 , model 2  @xmath123 , and model 3  @xmath124 .",
    "also shown are previous temperature measurements of the cmbr by previous authors including cobe90 .",
    "it is noted that all three models from this work are in agreement with the cobe90 measurements ( including the uncertainty in the measurements ) . ]",
    "previous efforts , fisher ( preprint ) , calculated an effective recombination coefficient for optically thin hydrogen clouds .",
    "an evolutionary model of the diffuse uv background was then calculated and its effects on the stability of metal - free lyman-@xmath0 cloud systems , because of radiation pressure , was modeled . from this model , limits were derived on the epoch of photoionization of the lyman-@xmath0 clouds .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed mass of luminous matter in the universe were used to determine the temperature and density of the igm at the epoch @xmath1 .",
    "this was used as a boundary condition to determine the thermal history of the igm .",
    "finally , the distortion of the cmbr because of this hot igm was calculated and compared to previously published data .",
    "this mode was found to disagree with the distortion as measured by the berkeley - nagoya group , but was found to be consistent with the preliminary results of the cosmic background explorer to high accuracy .",
    "this model of the igm is not capable of producing the cosmic x ray background as measured .    the most interesting result of this work is its implication for the distortion of the cmbr .",
    "much effort had been made to explain the distortion in the wien tail of the cmbr , as measured prior to the launch of the cobe satellite .",
    "the original intent of this study was to proceed along the same path as previous authors , most notably tw , and determine if the then observed distortion could be attributed to inverse compton scattering of the cmbr photons by hot igm electrons .",
    "the hoped for end result was to compare the required density and temperature of the igm to the observed conditions in the lyman-@xmath0 forest cloud systems . only after the model was complete , and the lack of a gross distortion similar to that published by the berkeley - nagoya group failed to appear , were the results of cobe made known . whereas it has been stated that cobe disproves a hot igm , this study indicates that the results , published to date , only dispel the previous results of the berkeley - nagoya group , and set a boundary , in temperature - density space , allowed for the igm .",
    "a hot igm may still exist and only after cobe extends the spectra to even shorter wavelengths , @xmath127 0.01 cm , will the limits on the existence of the hot igm proposed here be discounted or substantiated .",
    "several observations are needed to support the theoretical findings presented here , most notably the cobe spectra noted above .",
    "other observations are needed to better define the limits on many of the physical characteristics of the lyman-@xmath0 cloud systems , including size , temperature , and distribution in neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "all of these values were used to determine the temperature and density of the igm .",
    "however , it is noted that drastic changes in the values of these parameters is not expected , and therefore the result of a hot igm will not change .",
    "the results of extending the cobe spectra to shorter wavelengths is most anxiously awaited .",
