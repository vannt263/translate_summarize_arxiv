    "the application of electromagnetic ( em ) fields to control the propagation of light through a medium has widespread applications in non - linear optics @xcite .",
    "one important example is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite where an optical control field modifies the transmission @xcite and the group velocity of light @xcite .",
    "the propagation of light through an eit medium can be described in terms of dark state polaritons @xcite . by varying the control field",
    "one can reversibly convert between the light and atomic excitations and thereby implement photon storage @xcite .",
    "the use of highly excited rydberg states in eit @xcite creates additional possibilities due to their extremely strong interparticle interactions and extreme sensitvity to external electric fields @xcite .",
    "for example , rydberg eit has been used to modify the frequency of light @xcite , study interactions in cold rydberg gases @xcite and probe electric fields inside vapour cells @xcite and close to surfaces @xcite .",
    "a feature of rydberg states is the large dipole moment to nearby states which scales with the square of the principal quantum number , @xmath4 .",
    "the large dipole moments are exploited to achieve the strong coupling regime in cavity qed @xcite .",
    "transitions between neighbouring rydberg states are typically in the microwave or millimeter wave regime .",
    "microwave or millimeter wave coupling is of interest in the context of precision measurement of the rydberg quantum defects @xcite , electric fields @xcite , and studies of multiphoton ionization @xcite , which can exhibit features of dynamical localisation @xcite .",
    "in addition the microwave field can be used to enhance resonant energy transfer to dipole - coupled pair - states @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the effect of resonant microwave fields on eit involving highly excited rydberg states . by modelling the experimental data we show that adding microwave coupling between rydberg states can switch the group index of the sample by @xmath2 .",
    "we also show that microwave dressing leads to complete or almost complete suppression of the eit due to enhanced interaction effects .",
    "the experiments are performed on a cloud of laser - cooled @xmath1rb atoms using the experimental setup described in @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup and atomic level scheme are shown schematically in ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "the atoms are loaded into a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) in 1  s and then after optical molasses are prepared in the 5s  @xmath5s@xmath6 @xmath7 state by optical pumping .",
    "eit spectroscopy is then performed using counter - propagating probe and coupling laser beams focused to 1/e@xmath5 radii of 12  @xmath8 m and 66 @xmath8 m , respectively .",

    "the plane of polarisation of the microwave field is orthogonal to the direction of the pump and probe beams .",
    "this configuration leads to microwave coupling to multiple magnetic sub - levels ( see section 3 ) and was constrained by the experimental geometry .",

    "the fits obtained from the model are also shown in .",
    "the experiment is modelled using the 10-level atom shown in interacting with an em field given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the polarization unit vectors representing @xmath18 transitions and @xmath19 is the polarization unit vector in the @xmath20 direction .",

    "the natural decay linewidths of the 46@xmath59 and 45@xmath60 states are approximately 2  khz and can be neglected , so only the decay channel from 5@xmath61 to 5@xmath59 at a rate @xmath62 mhz is included using operator @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to spontaneous emission , the dephasing due to the finite linewidth of the probe and coupling fields ( giving rise to dephasing rates @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively ) is included , as well as the dephasing of the rydberg states with respect to the other states ( rate @xmath66 ) .",
    "the latter is most likely due to fluctuating electric and magnetic stray fields .",
    "the linewidth of the microwave source is negligible .",
    "for eit the important linewidth is the relative linewidth @xmath67 of the two - photon transition between the probe and coupling laser , typically taken equal to @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "however , for the eit locking scheme used to stabilise the coupling laser transition @xcite , @xmath67 is actually less than the linewidth of either laser .",

    "@xmath71 is independent of @xmath65 ; instead it is only through @xmath67 that the linewidth of the coupling laser enters . setting the column density , cd@xmath78 and assuming the weak probe limit",
    ", the transmission becomes a function of 8 parameters , i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath80 which can be determined from fitting experimental data .",
    "we began by fitting to data using the probe laser only , reducing the system to 2-levels to obtain cd and @xmath81 ( 1.5@xmath82 m@xmath83 and @xmath84 mhz , respectively ) .",
    "subsequently , we fit the 3-level eit transmission , which determines the quantities @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 mhz , @xmath89 mhz and @xmath90 mhz , respectively ) .",
    "finally the remaining three variables , related to the microwave dressing , @xmath91 , @xmath42 and @xmath66 are determined using the 10-level model .",
    "@xmath92 scales proportional to the applied microwave field as expected , @xmath93 fluctuates between @xmath94 and 0 mhz and @xmath95 is 0.3 mhz . using this method we obtain excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction ( red solid curve ) and the experimental data ( black solid curve ) for each microwave power , as shown in .",
    "the calculated lineshape is sensitive to the number of levels included in the model .",
    "reducing the number of states removes the symmetry in the system , leading to anomalous resonances which are not observed in the experiment .",
    "this 10-level w model represents the minimum number of states required to accurately reproduce both the detuning of the microwave splitting and the peak amplitudes .",
    "one attractive aspect of eit is the possibility to obtain a very high group index resulting in slow light @xcite . by varying the group index",
    "one can change the mixing angle between the light and matter components of dark state polaritons @xcite and thereby implement photon storage @xcite .",
    "the group index of the system is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the frequency of the probe laser and @xmath98/2 $ ] is the refractive index .",
    "the large group index arises from the rapid variation of @xmath99 with @xmath97 due to the coupling laser .",
    "an interesting feature of microwave dressing is the ability to modify the dispersion and hence the dynamics of the rydberg dark state polaritons @xcite on relatively fast time scales . in practice ,",
    "the time response of the dark - states which produce the dispersive feature is limited by eit transients which depend on the multi - photon rabi frequency @xcite .    to illustrate the potential of microwave dressing to modify the dispersion we extract the real part of the susceptibility from the 10-level model and use this to calculate the group index which is plotted in .",
    "we see that on resonance , the microwave field allows independent control of the group index and absorption which could prove useful in controlling the interaction between dark state polaritons . at a probe detuning of @xmath100 = 1",
    "mhz without and with the microwave field the group index is switched from approximately @xmath101 ( figure 4(e ) ) to @xmath102 ( figure 4(f ) ) within the transparency window .",
    "the negative group index corresponds to `` superluminal '' or backwards propagation @xcite , albeit with increased dissipation .",
    "however , in contrast to the simple probe - only case ( a ) , with microwave dressing one can vary both the microwave and coupling laser powers to trade - off between pulse speed , bandwidth and transparency .",
    "all of the data presented above are taken in the weak probe regime of eit where @xmath103 , resulting in a resonant dark state with all the population in the ground state .",
    "as the probe rabi frequency is increased , dipole - dipole interactions between rydberg atoms prevent more than a single rydberg excitation if the resulting energy shift of the rydberg state , @xmath104 , is larger than the energy width of the two - photon resonance , @xmath105 .",
    "this is known as dipole - blockade @xcite .",
    "the blockade mechanism modifies the eit dark state as now only a single photon can create transparency in the blockaded volume .",
    "this causes a suppression of transmission on resonance @xcite .",
    "figures 5(a ) and ( b ) show eit data taken for a weak and strong probe rabi frequency , showing the interaction induced suppression . if a weak microwave coupling ( @xmath106 ) is now introduced from 46s@xmath6 to 45p@xmath6 , the suppression is dramatically enhanced , as illustrated in figures 5(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "as the microwave coupling is weak the effect on the group index is small and increased eit suppression occurs predominantly due to the change in the form of the interactions . without the microwave field ,",
    "@xmath107 for two atoms both in the @xmath108 state scales as @xmath109 with a coefficient of @xmath110 ghz @xmath8m@xmath111 @xcite , giving a blockade radius of approximately 3.5  @xmath8 m for @xmath112  mhz .",
    "the microwaves however drive a resonant coupling , resulting in an interaction shift scaling as @xmath3 .",
    "( the coefficient is approximately @xmath113 ghz @xmath8m@xmath114 using the dipole matrix element from above . ) as illustrated in figure 5(e ) , this @xmath3 potential can be expected to yield a larger blockade radius , hence a larger average number of blockaded atoms and an enhanced suppression of eit . for two atoms prepared in the superposition of rydberg states driven by the resonant microwave field",
    ", the blockade radius would be approximately 7  @xmath8 m , neglecting any interaction with rydberg atoms outside the blockade sphere .    to evaluate the role of the van der waals interaction in the change in the transmission between ( a ) and ( b ) , we develop the following simple model .",
    "we postulate that any non - blockaded atom driven by the two laser fields has a probability @xmath115 to be in the dark state and inhibit the formation of a dark state in any atom located at a distance @xmath116 , a probability @xmath117 to be in a dark state and not inhibit the formation of a dark state in neighbouring atoms , and a zero probability of affecting atoms beyond @xmath118 .",
    "we define the blockade radius @xmath118 by the equation @xmath119 , where @xmath104 is the @xmath109 shift shown in figure 5(e ) , and we set @xmath120 with @xmath121 the population of the @xmath108 state calculated as described in section 3 .",
    "( @xmath121 does not exceed about 0.3 for the parameters considered . )",
    "we thus assume that any blockaded atom scatters the probe laser as if the coupling laser was not present and that any non - blockaded atom forms a transparent dark state as if the rydberg - rydberg interaction was not present .",
    "accordingly , we take the susceptibility to be @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the susceptibility of an atom in the dark state , @xmath124 the susceptibility of a two - level atom , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the number densities of dark state and blockaded atoms , respectively . assuming that the blockade spheres do not overlap , we can write @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "( @xmath73 is the local atomic density , which we derive from the experimental cd assuming a gaussian density profile . for a constant @xmath73 ,",
    "a blockade sphere contains @xmath129 blockaded atoms on average , since the atoms are distributed randomly and the centre of the sphere , which is occupied by a dark state atom , is of zero measure .",
    "typically , @xmath130 for @xmath131 @xmath8 m . )    the weak - probe data in ( a ) and ( c ) is fitted using the procedure described above to obtain the model parameters shown in .",
    "the local susceptibilities @xmath132 , @xmath124 and @xmath133 are then calculated using the same parameters but with the higher probe rabi frequency of figure 5(b ) , taking into account the spatial intensity profile of the probe beam ( including its attenuation as it passes through the medium ) . the resulting transmission profile of the atomic cloud is represented by a solid curve in figure 5(b ) . for the parameters considered ,",
    "the transmission profile obtained by correcting equation ( [ eq : chiav ] ) for the overlap of the different blockade spheres is almost the same as without correction , except for @xmath134 where it is up to 4% higher .",
    "we conclude from the reasonable agreement between the model and the data that the decrease in the experimental transmission between ( a ) and ( c ) is consistent with a blockade of rydberg excitation by the van der waals interaction .    using the same model to calculate the transmission with the microwave field present , with @xmath120 and the blockade radius still given by the @xmath135 van der waals interaction , leads to the result represented by the solid curve in figure 5(d ) .",
    "this result is in clear disagreement with the experimental transmission .",
    "( the @xmath136 van der waals interaction is unimportant as far as determining the blockade radius is concerned since the @xmath137 is not directly coupled to the @xmath138 state . )",
    "a better match to the data is obtained by taking @xmath115 to be the total population in the rydberg states and @xmath104 to be the @xmath3 dipole - dipole shift when determining the blockade radius ( the dotted curve ) .",
    "however , the model still underestimates the suppression of eit , and the data is more closely approximated by the transmission profile calculated assuming that the whole atomic cloud is blockaded ( the dashed curve ) .",
    "these results indicate that the @xmath3 dipole - dipole interaction between rydberg states resonantly coupled by the microwave field is significant and point to the ensuing breakdown of the approximation of a pair - wise interaction @xcite .    .",

    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated microwave dressing of electromagnetically induced transparency involving highly excited rydberg states .",
    "the microwave field splits the eit peak resulting in independent control of the absorptive and dispersive properties of the medium .",
    "consequently a microwave field could be used to control the interaction time between rydberg polaritons .",
