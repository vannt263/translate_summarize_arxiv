    "bright spheroids ( elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies ) tend to be less dense than faint spheroids , in two distinct ways .",
    "bright spheroids have larger scale lengths , @xmath1 , and lower mean densities within @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the half - light radius and @xmath3 is the total luminosity .",
    "bright galaxies also tend to have density profiles that are less concentrated toward the center .",
    "the luminosity densities of elliptical galaxies and bulges rise approximately as power laws at the smallest observable radii , @xmath4 .",
    "faint galaxies ( @xmath5 ) have @xmath6 while bright galaxies have @xmath7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of the second correlation raises two questions . why do bright galaxies have lower central concentrations than faint galaxies ; and how is this correlation maintained in the face of mergers ?",
    "big galaxies will sometimes accrete small galaxies , and the small galaxy will be resistant to tidal disruption due to its higher density ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a small galaxy that survived such a merger with its central regions intact would create a new , high - density core in the merger remnant , destroying the observed correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath8 .    the survivability of compact galaxies during mergers is relevant to the origin of galaxies with kinematically distinct cores .",
    "forbes , franx & illingworth ( 1995 ) investigated whether the properties of such galaxies were consistent with the accretion hypothesis .",
    "they found no strong evidence for abnormal surface brightness profiles ( ` cores within cores ' ) but noted that `` this problem can possibly be circumvented by adding a massive black hole to the host galaxy .",
    "the [ host ] galaxy might be able to disrupt the victim galaxy , resulting in a density profile more like that which is seen . ''",
    "they suggested that `` simulations with realistic density profiles and possible black holes would be valuable . ''    here we present the results of such simulations .",
    "we consider mergers between initially spherical galaxies with a mass ratio of @xmath9 ; each galaxy has a power - law central density cusp as well as a central point mass representing a supermassive black hole .",
    "the galaxies structural parameters are scaled in accordance with observed relations (  2 ) .",
    "we find , in agreement with the suggestion of forbes , franx & illingworth ( 1995 ) , that the black hole in the primary galaxy is effective at disrupting the cusp of the secondary galaxy , yielding a remnant density profile that is only slightly more centrally concentrated than that of the primary galaxy at the start of the simulation .",
    "the initial galaxies were generated from dehnen s ( 1993 ) spherical density law , @xmath10(r / a)^{-\\gamma}(1+r / a)^{\\gamma-4}$ ] .",
    "initial particle velocities were assigned from the unique isotropic distribution function that reproduces dehnen s density law in the combined potential of the stars and a central point mass representing the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "our primary galaxy had @xmath11 , characteristic of the shallow cusps of bright galaxies , and our secondary galaxy had @xmath12 , characteristic of the steep cusps of dwarf galaxies .",
    "each `` black hole '' was assigned a mass of @xmath13 times that of its parent galaxy .",
    "this is slightly above , but consistent with , the current best estimate of @xmath14 for the average ratio of black hole mass to luminous galaxy mass in the local universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "henceforth the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 will refer to the primary ( massive ) and secondary ( dwarf ) galaxies respectively .",
    "all of the simulations had @xmath17 .",
    "the mass @xmath18 and scale length @xmath19 of the primary galaxy were set to unity .",
    "the orbital period at the half - mass radius of the primary is @xmath20 in model units .",
    "the scale length of the secondary galaxy was computed from the relation = r_e,2r_e,1(r_e,1a_1/r_e,2a_2 ) where the ratio @xmath21 between effective radius and scale length is given by dehnen ( 1993 ) as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "real spheroids have @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 the mass - to - light ratio of the stars ; hence @xmath25 . setting @xmath26 ( e.g. @xcite ) and @xmath27 ( e.g. @xcite ) gives @xmath28 . using our assumed mass ratio of @xmath9 and the adopted values for @xmath8 ,",
    "equation ( 1 ) then implies @xmath29 .",
    "the center of the secondary galaxy was initially displaced from the center of the primary galaxy by @xmath30 times the half - mass radius of the primary along the @xmath31-axis .",
    "the initial velocity of the secondary galaxy was assigned one of four values determined by @xmath32 , the angular momentum of the secondary s orbit in units of the angular momentum of a circular orbit .",
    "we chose @xmath33 ; the initial velocity vector of the secondary galaxy was parallel to the @xmath34 axis .",
    "the primary galaxy was assigned @xmath35 particles and the secondary galaxy @xmath36 particles . since @xmath37 , all particles had the same mass .",
    "this was done to avoid any spurious relaxation due to mass segregation .",
    "the evolution was followed using the tree code gadget of springel et .",
    "al ( 2000 ) , a parallel algorithm with continuosly variable time steps for each particle .",
    "the parameters in this code that most strongly affect the accuracy of the integrations are the softening length @xmath38 and the time step parameter @xmath39 .",
    "we chose @xmath40 , slightly smaller than the radius @xmath41 at which the two black holes would be expected to form a hard binary .",
    "this softening length corresponds to @xmath42 pc with typical scalings .",
    "our value @xmath43 for the accuracy parameter was chosen so as to require @xmath44 time steps for a star in a circular orbit with radius @xmath38 around the large black hole .",
    "extensive testing was carried out to ensure that the selected values for the tree - code parameters resulted in no changes in the density profiles of either galaxy on length scales @xmath45 when integrated in isolation .",
    "the merger simulations were continued until roughly one crossing time of the primary galaxy after formation of the hard black - hole binary .",
    "integrations were carried out on the parallel supercomputers at the rutgers center for advanced information processing ( a sun hpc-10000 ) and at the san diego supercomputer center ( cray t3e ) .",
    "all simulations used @xmath46 processors .    in order to test the influence of the secondary s black hole on the evolution , each run was repeated using a secondary galaxy with the same initial density profile but lacking a central point mass . to test the importance of the primary s black hole , a further set of runs were carried out in which neither galaxy contained a black hole .",
    "the velocity distribution functions for the models without black holes were computed as in dehnen ( 1993 ) .",
    "the results are summarized in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "figure 1a shows , for @xmath47 , the number of particles initially associated with the two galaxies that remain within spheres of radius @xmath48 ( primary ) and @xmath49 ( secondary ) around their respective black holes ; these are roughly the respective radii inside of which the final density profile of each galaxy shows substantial evolution .",
    "figure 1 reveals two ways in which the merger causes the central density of the final object to be less than the sum of the central densities of the two initial objects . 1",
    ". the density of stars around the black hole in the primary galaxy drops steadily throughout the simulation , and drops suddenly whenever the secondary galaxy passes near the primary s center ; the drops are preceded by jumps resulting from the impulsive increase in the gravitational force caused by the passage of the small galaxy .",
    "the density of stars around the black hole in the secondary galaxy also drops , but only after the secondary passes sufficiently close to the center of the primary . in the case of plunging orbits ,",
    "@xmath50 or @xmath51 , the first close passage occurs during the first infall ; the drop in density of the secondary is again preceded by a jump indicating that the mechanism is impulsive addition of energy , this time from the gravitational force of the primary s black hole . in the case of the more circular orbits ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 , the central density of the secondary remains high until the radius of its orbit has decayed to @xmath54 .",
    "the presence of the black hole in the secondary galaxy might naively be expected to contribute to the stability of that galaxy s core by enhancing the gravitational force there .",
    "in fact the opposite is true : the density at late times in the runs without a second black hole is generally _ higher _ than in the run with two black holes ( fig .",
    "this is probably a consequence of three - body ejection of stars by the pair of black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the softening of the inter - particle forces in gadget does not permit this process to be followed with high accuracy .",
    "the final central densities that we observe in the runs with two black holes should therefore be interpreted as upper limits .",
    "removing the black hole from the primary galaxy has almost no effect on its evolution , but the central density of the secondary galaxy now remains high throughout the merger ( figure 1b ) .",
    "figures 2a - d show the final density profiles from the four runs in which both galaxies contained black holes .",
    "the profiles are centered on the black hole binary and were computed using mapel ( @xcite ) . the secondary s density ( fig .",
    "2a ) is lowered at small radii , @xmath55 , due to impulsive heating from the primary black hole , and at large radii , @xmath56 , due to tidal forces from the primary galaxy .",
    "the greatest decrease in central density occurs in the runs with lowest @xmath57 , i.e. the most plunging orbits . in the case of stars initially associated with the primary galaxy ,",
    "the final density profile is remarkably independent of @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "the primary galaxy was found to always exhibit a @xmath58 central density cusp at the end of the simulations ; a similar result was found by nakano & makino ( 1999a , b ) when they dropped a black hole into the core of a galaxy containing no black hole . the net result ( fig .",
    "2c ) is a remnant density profile that rises modestly above that of the initial , primary galaxy at small radii , more so in the runs with larger @xmath57 .",
    "however the slope of the surface brightness profile ( fig .",
    "2d ) is only slightly increased near the center compared with that of the primary galaxy .",
    "we note that many bright elliptical galaxies also show mild inflections in their central surface brightness profiles on similar scales ( e.g. figure 1 of @xcite ) , perhaps relics of past mergers .",
    "when the black hole is removed from the primary galaxy , the secondary galaxy survives the merger intact , with almost no change in its density profile at small radii ( fig .",
    "the final density profile of the remnant is roughly a superposition of the two initial profiles ( figure 2 g ) ; a substantial inflection in the surface brightness profile now appears at a radius of @xmath54 ( figure 2h ) .",
    "profiles of this sort are rarely if ever observed in the brightest elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our merger simulations are the first in which the central densities of the merging galaxies are realistically high and in which both galaxies contain `` black holes . ''",
    "barnes ( 1999 ) described mergers of identical dehnen models with cusp slopes @xmath59 but without black holes ; he found that the cusps survived the mergers with little change . we find a similar result here in the runs without black holes except that the density of the primary galaxy falls due to energy input from the secondary . the opposite case ",
    "mergers between galaxies with central black holes but no cusps  has been treated extensively ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a number of authors have investigated the effects of dropping one or two black holes into a pre - existing galaxy , either with a central density cusp ( @xcite ) or without ( @xcite , 1999b ) .",
    "the simulations closest in spirit to ours are those of holley - bockelmann & richstone ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors followed the evolution of a dense secondary galaxy as it moved in the fixed gravitational field of a less - dense primary containing a black hole ; the secondary contained no black hole .",
    "the decay of the secondary s orbit was induced artificially using standard expressions for the dynamical friction , with corrections due to the changing mass of the secondary .",
    "since the density of the primary galaxy was fixed in these simulations , the authors did not observe the drop in the primary s central density which we see here ( fig .",
    "2b ) ; hence the central densities of their merger remnants were too high , partly explaining their conclusion that all but the most plunging orbits resulted in merger remnants with unphysically steep cusps .",
    "holley - bockelmann & richstone also observed a stronger dependence of the secondary s density evolution on its initial orbit than seen here , probably because of the approximate way in which orbital decay was treated .",
    "our results support the hypothesis that the persistence of low - density cores in giant galaxies is a consequence of the existence of supermassive black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central density did nevertheless increase in our simulations , and since a typical bright galaxy is expected to have accreted many smaller galaxies since its formation ( e.g. @xcite ) , one might still predict the formation of dense nuclei in bright galaxies , contrary to what is observed .",
    "however our simulations are not able to follow the evolution of a black - hole binary on sub - parsec scales as it ejects stars from the core and lowers the density there still more ( @xcite ) .",
    "future work should be directed toward understanding the effects of hierarchical mergers on galaxy density profiles , using @xmath60-body codes that can deal efficiently with unsoftened particles and hence follow the interaction of a binary black hole with the surrounding stars .",
