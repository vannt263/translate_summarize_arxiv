    "as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars evolve toward compact objects with surrounding planetary nebulae ( pne ) , mass - loss occurs in the spherically symmetric circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) with low ( @xmath930kms@xmath6 ) expansion velocities . despite the spherical symmetry in the progenitor objects , pne typically exhibit morphologies , such as axisymmetric structures , that are clearly not formed through normal agb mass - loss mechanisms @xcite .",
    "maser emission ( sio , h@xmath1o and oh ) from agb stars can provide insights into the structure and dynamics of the cse . in late - type stars ,",
    "the conditions for the formation of the various species of masers are typically met in a progression of zones .",
    "the sio masers occur relatively close to the star and have velocities near the radial velocity of the star .",
    "the h@xmath1o and oh masers are found in the circumstellar wind region at progressively further distances from the star .",
    "the h@xmath1o and oh spectral profiles are often double peaked , and the velocity range covered by the oh is larger than that of the h@xmath1o .",
    "there is a small but growing number of evolved stars which have been shown to deviate from this prototypical agb envelope .",
    "these objects have been dubbed ",
    "water - fountain \" sources due to their high - velocity h@xmath1o masers . to date",
    "there are three confirmed water - fountain sources : iras16342@xmath03814 @xcite , iras19134 + 2131 @xcite , and w43a @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1o masers associated with these objects are characterized by wide velocity ranges @xmath10kms@xmath6 .",
    "specifically , for iras16342@xmath03814 , iras19134 + 2131 , and w43a , @xmath11 is 259kms@xmath6 , 132kms@xmath6 and 180kms@xmath6 respectively ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these velocties are much greater than those of the typical oh / ir star in which differences between the blue- and red - shifted peaks of the oh masers are @xmath22040kms@xmath6 @xcite and roughly 75% of this range ( 1530 kms@xmath6 ) for the h@xmath1o masers @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the two sources ( iras16342@xmath03814 and w43a ) that have detected oh masers , the h@xmath1o masers have a larger @xmath11 than the corresponding oh .    in addition to the unusual spectral characteristics , the h@xmath1o masers associated with the water - fountain sources appear to exhibit unique spatial structures as revealed by radio interferometric images . in the first very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi )",
    "study of the h@xmath1o masers toward w43a , @xcite showed that the water masers are formed in a collimated precessing jet with a true 3-dimensional space velocity of 145kms@xmath6 .",
    "studies of iras16342@xmath03814 @xcite and iras19134 + 2131 @xcite have yielded similar bipolar maser distributions albeit without the precession observed in w43a .",
    "the h@xmath1o masers toward iras16342@xmath03814 and w43a are also more extended than the oh masers in these sources .",
    "the bipolar jets traced by the h@xmath1o masers , presumably along the polar axis of the star , may represent the onset of the axisymmetric morphologies that typify pne .",
    "the dynamical ages of the jets for iras19134 + 2131 and w43a are estimated to be @xmath250yr and @xmath240yr respectively @xcite . that for iras16342 - 3814 is estimated to be @xmath2150yr @xcite .",
    "thus the evolutionary stage that these water - fountain sources represent is likely very short , so such objects must be quite rare .",
    "maser emission from oh12.8@xmath00.9 was first observed by @xcite who classified it as a type ii oh / ir star because of its characteristic double - peaked 1612-mhz oh maser profile .",
    "the star has been associated with the infrared source iras18139 - 1816 @xcite which is @xmath226arcsec away .",
    "the exceptional spectral characteristics of the h@xmath1o masers toward oh12.8@xmath00.9 , were first highlighted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the very large array ( vla ) to show that the  anomalous \" h@xmath1o and oh maser emission was coincident to within 1@xmath12 , and therefore belonged to the same source .",
    "@xcite also found double - peaked profiles for both the oh and the h@xmath1o with the peaks of the oh separated by @xmath223kms@xmath6 and h@xmath1o peaks separated by nearly twice this amount , @xmath242kms@xmath6 .",
    "although the velocity range for the h@xmath1o is not as wide as the other water - fountain sources , @xcite found that the shape and variations in the spectra are consistent with the water - fountain class and are compatible with an axisymmetric wind .",
    "engels suggested that oh12.8@xmath00.9 may represent an earlier evolutionary stage of water fountain , and that the h@xmath1o maser velocities may increase with increasing post - agb wind speeds .",
    "although the spectral characteristics provide a hint that oh12.8@xmath00.9 is related to the water - fountain sources , to verify that it is truly a member of this class requires high - resolution vlbi imaging of the h@xmath1o maser emission .",
    "we therefore observed the h@xmath1o masers associated with oh12.8@xmath00.9 using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) in order to map the maser distribution . in this article , we present the first vlbi images of the h@xmath1o masers toward oh12.8@xmath00.9 and discuss the nature of this interesting source .",
    "we observed the 22.2 ghz h@xmath1o and both the 1612 mhz satellite - line and the 1667 mhz main - line oh maser emission from oh12.8@xmath00.9 ( @xmath13 , j2000 ) .",
    "observations of the h@xmath1o masers occurred on 2004 june 21 for 5 hrs starting at 04:43 ut ( jd 2453177.7 ) .",
    "observations of the oh masers occurred in two 5hr epochs on 2004 march 16 starting at 11:04 ut ( jd 2453081.0 ) and 2004 july 25 starting at 02:29 ut ( jd 2453211.6 ) . oh12.8@xmath00.9 and three continuum calibrators ( 1751 + 096 , j1832@xmath02039 , and 3c345 ) were observed using the 10 stations of the vlba .",
    "the vlba is operated by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "reference frequencies of 22.23508 , 1.61223 , and 1.66736ghz were used for the h@xmath1o , the oh satellite - line , and the oh main - line maser transitions respectively .",
    "the h@xmath1o data were recorded in dual circular polarization using two 8-mhz ( 112.6kms@xmath6 ) bands centered on the local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity of @xmath058.0kms@xmath6 .",
    "system temperatures and point source sensitivities were on the order of @xmath2120k and @xmath29jyk@xmath6 respectively .",
    "the oh data were recorded in dual circular polarization using four 0.5-mhz ( 92.7kms@xmath6 ) bands centered on the lsr velocity of @xmath058.0kms@xmath6 .",
    "system temperatures and point source sensitivities were on the order of @xmath2160k and @xmath29.5jyk@xmath6 respectively .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator operated by nrao in socorro , new mexico . auto and cross - correlation spectra consisting of 512 channels with channel spacings of 15.63khz ( @xmath20.22kms@xmath6 ) and 0.98khz ( @xmath20.18kms@xmath6 ) for the h@xmath1o and oh respectively were produced .",
    "calibration was performed in accordance with standard vlba spectral - line procedures using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) maintained by nrao .",
    "the bandpass response was determined from scans on the continuum calibrators and was used to correct the target source data .",
    "a preliminary inspection of the auto - correlation ( ac ) spectra for the 10 antennas at this point showed that the 1667 mhz main - line oh transition was not detected toward oh12.8@xmath00.9 .",
    "both the h@xmath1o and the 1612 mhz satellite line of oh were detected in the ac spectra of all antennas .",
    "the time - dependent gains of all antennas relative to a reference antenna were determined by fitting a template ac spectrum ( from the reference antenna with the target source at a high elevation ) to the ac spectra of each antenna .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was established by scaling these gains by the system temperature and gain of the reference antenna .",
    "errors in the gain and pointing of the reference antenna and the atmospheric opacity contribute to the error in the absolute amplitude calibration , which is accurate to about 1520% .    to correct any instrumental delay , a fringe fit was performed on the continuum calibrator scans and residual group delays for each antenna were determined .",
    "residual fringe - rates were obtained by fringe - fitting a strong reference feature in the spectrum of each maser transition . at this stage in the reduction ,",
    "no fringes for the 1612 mhz oh line were detected on baselines other than the shortest ( los alamos  pie town ) vlba baseline . the likely cause for this non - detection is localized interstellar scattering along the line - of - sight to oh12.8@xmath00.9 , which is relatively close to the galactic center , a direction known to exhibit anomalously high scattering on certain lines of sight @xcite .",
    "thus , the remaining discussion applies only to the h@xmath1o maser data .",
    "the fringe - rate solutions from the fringe fit were applied to all channels in the h@xmath1o maser spectrum . an iterative self - calibration and imaging procedure",
    "was then performed on the reference channel .",
    "the resulting residual phase and amplitude corrections were applied to all channels in the band .",
    "a low - resolution cube of images @xmath14 pixels ( @xmath2@xmath15mas ) was formed covering the observed velocity range to locate regions of emission using a synthesized beam of @xmath16mas .",
    "two regions of emission were identified corresponding to spectral channel ranges from @xmath037.8kms@xmath6 to @xmath029.4kms@xmath6 and from @xmath086.2kms@xmath6 to @xmath075.7 kms@xmath6 .",
    "full - resolution cubes of images @xmath17 pixels ( @xmath2@xmath18mas ) were generated for each range of channels using a synthesized beam of @xmath19mas .",
    "the rms off - source noise ( @xmath20 ) was typically 3mjybeam@xmath6 in all channels .    in order to extract maser component parameters , two - dimensional gaussian functions were fit to the emission in the individual channel maps .",
    "image quality was assessed using the off - source rms noise and the deepest negative pixel in the image .",
    "a cutoff flux density was conservatively set at 10@xmath20 .",
    "features with flux densities greater than this cutoff were fit with gaussians to determine component parameters .",
    "errors in the fitted positions of identified features were computed following the methods outlined in @xcite .",
    "these errors ranged from 5@xmath21as for features with high signal - to - noise , to 60",
    "@xmath21as for features with lower signal - to - noise .",
    "because the emission from each maser feature extends over multiple spectral channels , it is desirable to determine a single velocity , flux density and position for each maser feature . in lieu of a full three - dimensional ( 3-d ) gaussian fit to the image cube",
    ", we used a flux - density - squared weighted averaging scheme to calculate nominal positions and velocities for each maser from the previously identified features .",
    "this method takes into account the increased significance of stronger emission channels .",
    "the velocities and relative offset positions thus represent weighted averages over the number of spanned channels . the assigned flux density is simply the peak value over the same range of channels .",
    "figure  [ spot_map ] shows the spectral ( upper sub - panels ) and spatial ( lower sub - panels ) distributions of the h@xmath1o masers toward oh12.8@xmath00.9 from the analysis of our vlba images .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the entire range of h@xmath1o maser emission from the star .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) show enlarged views of the blue - shifted masers to the north and the red - shifted masers to the south respectively .    focusing on the upper sub - panel of figure  [ spot_map](a ) ,",
    "we see the previously observed spectral characteristics of the oh12.8@xmath00.9 .",
    "the 1612 mhz oh masers form a double - peaked profile with peaks at @xmath068.0 and @xmath043.7kms@xmath6 . the center of the profile is roughly @xmath055.8kms@xmath6 , which is consistent with the stellar radial velocity of @xmath22kms@xmath6 previously determined from the oh emission @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1o spectrum also has a double - peaked profile , however , the h@xmath1o masers have a greater velocity extent with peaks at @xmath081.7 and @xmath033.3kms@xmath6 . the midpoint between these peaks ( @xmath057.5kms@xmath6 )",
    "is slightly offset from the stellar velocity .",
    "the lower sub - panel of figure  [ spot_map](a ) shows that the masers occupy two distinct regions oriented roughly north ",
    "south on the sky with an angular separation of @xmath2109mas .",
    "the position angle of the axis of separation between the centers of the northern and southern maser regions is 1.5@xmath3 east of north .",
    "this double - lobed distribution is consistent with vlbi observations of other water - fountain sources that show the masers occupy widely separated clumps along a presumed polar axis .",
    "separations of @xmath23000mas ( 6000 au ) , @xmath2150mas ( 2400 au ) and @xmath2700mas ( 1700 au ) were determined for iras16342@xmath03814 , iras19134 + 2131 and w43a respectively @xcite ( note that the distances to all sources are somewhat uncertain , with w43a the most reliably known ) . the linear separation of the two maser regions toward oh12.8@xmath00.9 is approximately @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the distance in kpc .",
    "unfortunately , the distance to oh12.8@xmath00.9 is unknown .",
    "if we assume the star is associated with the galactic center @xcite , at @xmath25kpc , then the linear separation between the blue- and red - shifted masers is @xmath2870au .    upon closer inspection of the blue- and red - shifted maser regions ( figure  [ spot_map ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) , we find that the masers are aligned along arc - like structures .",
    "the blue- and red - shifted arcs are approximately 10 and 12mas ( 80 and 96au at 8kpc ) across respectively , corresponding to an opening angle for the jet that likely drives their formation of 1013@xmath3 .",
    "these arcs have an orientation that is roughly perpendicular to the separation ( polar ) axis .",
    "one might expect such a morphology in the case of an edge - on shock front propagating outward into a slower ambient medium .",
    "such arc - like structures have also been observed for the h@xmath1o masers toward iras 16342@xmath03814 , and have been shown to have a global outward motion @xcite .",
    "further observations of oh12.8@xmath00.9 will be required to measure the proper motions of its h@xmath1o masers .",
    "although the radial velocity range for the h@xmath1o is not as wide as the more well - known water - fountain sources , @xcite found that the shape and variations in the h@xmath1o maser spectra are consistent with this class .",
    "the velocity difference between the blue- and red - shifted h@xmath1o masers also appears to be increasing over time from early values of @xmath26kms@xmath6 @xcite to our most recent measurement of @xmath27kms@xmath6 .",
    "values of @xmath11 based on the most dominant features in the h@xmath1o spectra as published in the literature are listed in table  [ accel_table ] and plotted in figure  [ accel_plot ] .",
    "all values prior to those in this work are determined from low spatial resolution ( i.e. single dish and vla ) observations and are therefore subject to spatial blending of multiple maser features in a single spectral channel . from figure  [ accel_plot ]",
    "we see that @xmath11 is obviously not constant over time , and that the masers are undergoing some form of acceleration ( possibly non - linear ) .",
    "since the errors in @xmath11 as determined from the literature are not well known , we chose to perform a simple least - squares fit to the points assuming constant acceleration .",
    "this fit yields a value of @xmath28kms@xmath29 or @xmath30kms@xmath6yr@xmath6 for the relative acceleration of the blue- and red - shifted masers in the radial direction .",
    "the 3-d acceleration is likely larger by a factor of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the inclination of the jet .",
    "the true 3-d velocities and accelerations of the masers remain to be determined through future vlbi proper motion studies .    as mentioned previously , the distance to oh12.8@xmath00.9 is unknown , which makes estimating the dynamical age of the outflow difficult . if we make several assumptions , namely : that the motions of the masers in the plane of the sky are comparable to the line - of - sight acceleration , that the dynamical center of the outflow is the midpoint along the axis of separation between the two maser regions , that the distance to the source is 8kpc , and that the masers have zero initial velocity , then an upper limit to the dynamical age of the outflow can be computed . under these assumptions , we compute a dynamical age of @xmath2109yr using the current spatial extent of the masers and the previously determined acceleration .",
    "similarly , a dynamical age of @xmath271yr is determined using the current expansion velocity of 24.2kms@xmath6 and the above acceleration .",
    "these two ages are roughly consistent with each other and with the ages computed for the three other water - fountain sources . for comparison , the dynamical ages of iras16342@xmath03814 , iras19134 + 2131 and w43a have been estimated to be @xmath2150yr @xcite , @xmath250yr @xcite and @xmath240yr @xcite respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the small velocity spread between the blue- and red - shifted masers of oh12.8@xmath00.9 relative to the other water - fountain sources would seem to indicate that the outflow is relatively young , the upper limit on the dynamical age is intermediate to those of the other sources in the class . assuming the acceleration remains constant at 0.68kms@xmath6yr@xmath6 , then the time to reach an outflow velocity comparable to the other water fountain sources ( @xmath33kms@xmath6 ) is only about 220yr or roughly twice the current dynamical age of oh12.8@xmath00.9 .",
    "using the vlba we have produced the first high - resolution interferometric images of the h@xmath1o masers toward the oh / ir star oh12.8@xmath00.9 .",
    "these images show that the masers lie in a double - lobed structure typical of objects belonging to the water - fountain class of sources .",
    "we also find that the two groupings of masers are arranged in arc - like structures suggestive of a bow - shock morphology .",
    "the spatio - kinematic structure determined from our vlba observations provides strong evidence that oh12.8@xmath00.9 is indeed a water fountain source , and that the outflow is accelerating in the line - of - sight direction .    in future observations",
    ", we hope to map the scatter - broadened oh masers using a shorter - baseline connected element interferometer such as the vla or the multi - element radio linked interferometer ( merlin ) .",
    "such observations should verify that the h@xmath1o masers lie further from the underlying star than the oh masers ; a characteristic evident in the other water - fountain sources .",
    "we also plan to undertake a multi - epoch vlbi campaign to study the proper motions of the h@xmath1o masers .",
    "such observations should allow us to characterize the three - dimensional motion of the masers , determine the distance to oh12.8@xmath00.9 , and determine a dynamical center and age for the outflow .",
