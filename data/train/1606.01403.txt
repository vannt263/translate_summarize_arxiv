    "the explosive growth in the number of mobile devices running the android platform has attracted the attention of hackers for the wealth of sensitive information that are usually stored on mobile devices , including phone numbers , short messages , confidential emails and correspondences , and banking information and credentials .",
    "the availability of this information in many mass - market mobile devices makes them a desirable target for hackers , who excelled at developing a large number of mobile malicious software ( malware ) , making the security of mobile devices one of the most important and challenging areas of research .",
    "for example , according to a report by mcafee , the total number of mobile malware continued its linear climb as it broke 8 million in the second quarter of 2015 , and increased by 17% over the first quarter of the same year @xcite .",
    "moreover , new malware families and variants were reported to appear approximately 1 million times in the same quarter . to address this trend , antivirus ( av )",
    "vendors analyze a large number of malware samples daily in order to prevent them from spreading widely and to guide users on disinfection and risk management by classifying malware into broad families .",
    "mobile as well as traditional malware analysis for detection and classification falls into two broad types : static and dynamic analysis . in static analysis",
    ", strings of bytes associated with malware samples are discovered through reverse engineering and used as a signature for identifying malicious software .",
    "although fast and efficient , static techniques are often prone to high false positive rates due to evolution in code basis and code repacking . furthermore , additional cost of those techniques is required for reverse engineering to generate reliable and meaningful signatures .",
    "on the other hand , dynamic and behavior based analysis aims to provide methods for effectively and efficiently extracting unique patterns of each malware family based on its behavior .",
    "malware samples of the same family often use the same code base , provide the same functionality using the same order of behavioral events  @xcite , and so on . in analyzing mobile malware , unique behavior patterns can be represented by various symbols ( e.g. , permission set , api call , and system call ) and used to identify malware families . to this end , researchers previously proposed various detection and classification methods for malware analysis based on their behavior , including permission - based , api call - based and system call - based methods .",
    "permission - based detection methods are not efficient in classifying benign applications as benign , since relevant rule sets only focus on detecting the malware .",
    "api call - based detection methods can not generate distinct signatures until decompilation or disassembly process is completed , which is often expensive .",
    "system call - based detection methods can more accurately detect malicious behavior than other methods , since it is impossible to modify original functionality of system calls : malware creators always attempt to disguise malicious behavior as normal behavior .",
    "however , proposed methods in this category mainly deal with frequency of system calls well presented in malware .",
    "the number of invoked system calls is usually small , and most of the system calls used in malware ( e.g. , read ( ) , write ( ) ) are also observed in both benign applications , affecting the accuracy of those methods . to this end , one needs to consider more features , such as arguments in the system call and network activities , to enhance malware detection and classification via behavior profiling .    to overcome the drawbacks in previous methods , we propose a feature - rich anti - malware system based on behavior profiling called andro - profiler . our proposed behavior profiling system comprises mobile devices and a remote server to facilitate profiling , and adopts profiling method in the malware analysis domain .",
    "we exploit system calls , including their arguments provided by lkm ( loadable kernel module ) and system logs ( e.g. , sms , call , and network i / o ) provided by droidbox @xcite as feature vectors for malware characterization .",
    "we define system calls and system logs as integrated system logs from which we directly infer behavior patterns representation using the concept of behavior profiling of bayer @xcite .",
    "we assume that : a ) malware samples have unique malicious behavior patterns , b ) malicious behavior is determined by system calls , and c ) such system call set has influence on the behavior of the program ( malware ) .",
    "we prepare representative behavior profile for each malware family represented by integrated system logs including system calls , their arguments , and system logs of droidbox  an analysis system we utilize in this work .",
    "we construct the behavior profile of each malware sample through its integrated system logs by executing it on an emulator .",
    "then , by comparing the behavior profiles across samples , we can detect and classify malware samples into related families .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we propose a novel anti - malware system based on behavior profiling called andro - profiler .",
    "we classify malware by exploiting the behavior profiling extracted from integrated system logs .",
    "our method captures the behavior profiling by converting integrated system logs into human - readable contexts , which helps analysts analyze malware intuitively .",
    "2 .   andro - profiler enables av vendors to react to many species of malicious samples by classifying and matching them with those previously detected quickly and efficiently .",
    "our system can help detect new malware including existing malware s variants and zero - day exploits .",
    "this is further highlighted through in - depth experiments using real - world malware samples .",
    "our proposed method is robust , and can be extended with additional features that depict the unique behavior patterns of malware .",
    "our method can easily employ static analysis technique to capture malicious behavior , in combination of the dynamic behavior , which is shown to outperform existing techniques in the literature .",
    "this feature of our work is highlighted by a comparison with the prior literature , experimentally .",
    "based on where the scan and monitoring of the mobile malware takes place , malware analysis methods are classified into three types : detection methods on the mobile device , detection methods outside the mobile device , and hybrid detection methods .",
    "we classify the literature based on the type of the malicious behavior into permission - based and footprint - based methods .",
    "footprint - based methods include system call - based , api call - based , decompiled code - based , and xml information - based methods .",
    "the detection methods on mobile device scan malicious behavior patterns on the mobile device and return the analysis results to the user . however , those approaches do not consider the resource constraints on the mobile device : low computing power and limited battery life , affect their usability and user experience .",
    "the detection methods outside mobile device execute detection algorithms on an emulator or a real device running the targeted applications , and conduct static or dynamic analysis for determining the nature of those applications .",
    "those approaches do not need to consider resource constraints , but can not respond to new malware families quickly . to overcome the drawbacks in both approaches ,",
    "hybrid approaches have been introduced in mobile malware analysis .",
    "client modules deployed on mobile devices collect information related to installed applications on those devices and send the information to a remote server .",
    "the remote server then analyzes log files using their detection algorithms of choice , while not impeding usability and user experience .",
    "table  [ tab : related ] summarizes the various malware detection or classification methods in the literature . in the following , we elaborate on some of the related works in each category .",
    "c c c c    approach & method & feature & previous works + & permission & permission &    .various malware detection@xmath1classification methods in previous works . [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     andro - profiler misclassified 225 benign samples as malware .",
    "we conducted a deep analysis to understand the high false positives with andro - profiler .",
    "interestingly , we found that some benign samples collected user s sensitive information , which we defined as a trigger for classifying malicious applications ( e.g. , imei , device i d , uuid , latitude , and longitude ) . to understand whether other anti - malware systems and scanners considered those benign applications as malware or not , we uploaded those suspected googleplay samples to virustotal and checked scanning results of various anti - virus vendors . as a result",
    ", we found that 110 out of the suspicious benign samples ( accounting for about @xmath2 ) were diagnosed as malware .",
    "the high rate of misclassification of benign applications is , however , understandable given various potential reasons for such infiltration of gray area applications into the market place  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of detecting zero - day malware detection .",
    "we define an application as a zero - day malware if it has malicious behavior and it can not be detected by av vendors . in order to verify that we had appropriately detected zero - day malware , we made 91 variant samples consisting of adwo and airpush families by leveraging adam @xcite .",
    "all samples used as the base application for the variants are among the ones which are used in the previous experiments , and detected by virustotal as malware samples . after creating the variants , we uploaded them ( as samples ) to the virustotal , and checked scanning results of various anti - virus ( av ) vendors such as f - secure , kaspersky , clamav , and avast .",
    "we noted that none of the submitted samples is reported as a malware when we carried out our experiment . as a result of our experiment using andro - profiler",
    ", we found that it performed well in detecting all of the variant malware samples with @xmath3 classification accuracy on average , regardless of the update method .",
    "our proposed system only takes 55 seconds / mb for classifying each malware ; we exclude setup time for analysis such as booting time of emulator .",
    "the majority of this time is spent in making the behavior profile ; it takes only 0.2 seconds on average to classify malware into each family .",
    "while the performance of our system is operationally reasonable , our system is scalable both horizontally and vertically by design .",
    "horizontally , and given that our server side components are run in a virtual environment , one can fork multiple servers by utilizing multiple virtual machines that exploit the multi - core nature of today s commodity computers .",
    "vertically , our system can benefit from being developed in a lower level language , such as the c language , which would make the classification process run faster .",
    "andro - profiler has a few limitations for detecting and classifying malware , since our proposed method uses integrated system logs as a feature vector and employs dynamic analysis techniques to capture malware s behavior .",
    "first , it is difficult for our system to analyze malware that are executed only under given conditions ( e.g. , sdk version , cellular network connection status , time , or place ) .",
    "however , this shortcoming is addressable by having various platforms tailored with various settings , as used for traditional malware in  @xcite .",
    "it is also impossible for our system to analyze malware embedding anti - malware analysis techniques .",
    "second , our emulator - based anti - malware system is dependent on sdk version of emulator , so our approach has limitation on analyzing malicious behavior related to privilege escalation .",
    "however , those are common drawbacks of dynamic analysis method or emulator - based detection method and addressed in the literature at some expense .",
    "finally , our approach analyzes malware on an emulator without interaction between human and device : autonomous installation and execution .",
    "when a malware behave upon an update or by utilizing a drive - by download attack @xcite , our approach is limited in reacting to such malware . however , autonomous installation and execution is an inevitable procedure for automation of dynamic analysis .",
    "depending on the number of malware samples to be analyzed , one can adopt manual human interactions to analyze malware samples and vet the outcomes of the automatic classification procedure , as used in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented andro - profiler , an anti - malware system based on behavior profiling .",
    "using andro - profiler , we classified malware by exploiting the behavior profiling extracted from integrated system logs , which are implicitly equivalent to distinct behavior characteristics .",
    "our behavior profiling is simple and relatively easy to understand , whereas andro - profiler is capable of distinguishing benign and malicious applications , and malicious applications into families .",
    "furthermore , andro - profiler is capable of detecting zero - day threats , which are missed by antivirus scanners .",
    "our experiments demonstrate that andro - profiler performs well in detecting and classifying malware families with over @xmath0 classification accuracy on average regardless of update method while crowdroid , a closely related work from the literature , performs under @xmath4 classification accuracy on average .",
    "our experiment results indicate that it takes 55 seconds / mb to analyze a malware on average , with a lot of opportunities for improvements on scalability .",
    "our system hence enables av vendors to react to many species of malicious samples by classifying and matching these with previous ones effectively and efficiently .",
    "there are several directions that we will pursue in the future .",
    "first , we would like to augment our system to not only rely on dynamic and behavioral features , but also static features that are easy to obtain from the applications at scale .",
    "furthermore , we will explore scalability issues associated with our system by implementing some of the guidelines noted in subsection _ efficiency of malware classification_.",
