    "in recent decades , quantitative financial risk measurement has provided a fundamental toolkit for investment decisions , capital allocation and external regulation .",
    "value - at - risk ( var ) and expected shortfall ( es ) are tail risk measures that are employed , as part of this toolkit , to help measure and control financial risk .",
    "var represents the market risk as one number , a quantile of the risk distribution , and has become a standard measurement for capital allocation and risk management , since it was proposed in 1993 .",
    "however , var has been criticized because it can not measure the expected loss for violating returns and is not mathematically coherent , in that it can favour non - diversification .",
    "es , proposed by artzner _",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) , gives the expected loss , conditional on returns exceeding a var threshold , and is a coherent measure , thus in recent years it has become more widely employed for tail risk measurement and is now recommended in the basel capital accord .",
    "volatility estimation can play a key role in calculating accurate var or es forecasts . since the introduction of the auto - regressive conditionally heteroskedastic ( arch ) model of engle ( 1982 ) and the generalized ( g)arch of bollerslev ( 1986 ) , both employing squared returns as model input , very many different volatility measures and models have been developed .",
    "since parkinson ( 1980 ) and garman and klass ( 1980 ) proposed the daily high - low range as a more efficient volatility estimator compared to the daily squared return , the availability of high frequency intra - day data has generated several popular and efficient realized measures , including realized variance ( rv ) : andersen and bollerslev ( 1998 ) , andersen _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) ; and realized range ( rr ) : martens and van dijk ( 2007 ) , christensen and podolskij ( 2007 ) . in order to further deal with the well - known , inherent micro - structure noise accompanying high frequency volatility measures , zhang , mykland and at - sahalia ( 2005 ) and martens and van dijk ( 2007 ) designed the sub - sampling and scaling processes , respectively , aiming to provide smoother and more efficient realized measures . in this paper",
    "the method of sub - sampling is extended to apply to the realized range measure .",
    "hansen _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) extended the parametric garch model framework by proposing the realized - garch ( re - garch ) , adding a measurement equation that contemporaneously links unobserved volatility with a realized measure .",
    "gerlach and wang ( 2015 ) extended the re - garch model through employing rr as the realized measure and illustrated that the proposed re - garch - rr framework can generate more accurate and efficient volatility , var and es forecasts compared to traditional garch and re - garch models .",
    "hansen and huang ( 2016 ) recently extended the parametric re - garch framework to include multiple realized measures .",
    "however , the tail - risk forecast performance of these parametric volatility models heavily depends on the choice of error distribution . a semi - parametric model that directly estimates quantiles and expectiles , and",
    "implicitly es , called the conditional autoregressive expectile ( care ) model is proposed by taylor ( 2008 ) .",
    "the relevant expectile can be estimated via asymmetric least squares ( als ) , which is transformed to be an estimate of es through a connection discovered by newey and powell ( 1987 ) .",
    "gerlach , chen and lin ( 2012 ) developed the non - linear family of care models and an associated bayesian estimation framework .",
    "further , gerlach and chen ( 2016 ) extended care type models through employing daily high - low range as input , whilst gerlach , walpole and wang ( 2016 ) proposed a care - x framework ; again finding that allowing rr to drive the model dynamics led to more accurate tail risk forecasts .    in this paper ,",
    "a realized conditional autoregressive expectile ( re - care ) framework is proposed , which is roughly analogous to the re - garch framework and is close to a semi - parametric realized garch model .",
    "the re - care incorporates the care model , but adds a measurement equation that links the latent conditional expectile with the realized measure .",
    "the work in gerlach and chen ( 2016 ) allows a likelihood formulation for care models , giving an mle that is equivalent to the als estimator .",
    "a standard parametric assumption on the errors of the re - care measurement equation allows this formulation to be extended , permitting an re - care likelihood to be developed and an ml estimator to be explored .",
    "further , an adaptive bayesian mcmc algorithm is developed as a competitor for the re - care model . to evaluate the performance of the proposed re - care models , employing the range and various realized measures as inputs ,",
    "the accuracy of var and es forecasts will be assessed and compared with competitors such as the care , garch and re - garch models .",
    "the care model includes a nuisance parameter , currently not estimable by standard methods , for which taylor ( 2008 ) employed a grid search estimator that optimized the sample violation rate .",
    "this paper extends that approach in three ways .",
    "first , the quantile loss function is proposed as a more suitable optimization criterion .",
    "second , a two - step search method , consisting of a coarse grid , followed by a refined grid search , is proposed as an alternative , helping to reduce the computing time in estimating this parameter , whilst maintaining an equivalent level of accuracy .",
    "third , a fast , efficient random walk metropolis method is proposed to perform the optimization , which corrects a convergence issue for this parameter in the proposed model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ realized_measure_section ] reviews some realized measures and proposes the sub - sampled rr .",
    "expectiles and their connection with existing care type models , as well as a review of re - garch type models comprises section[expectile_care_section ] .",
    "section [ model_section ] proposes the realized - care class of model ; the associated likelihood and the adaptive bayesian mcmc algorithm for parameter estimation are presented in section [ beyesian_estimation_section ] .",
    "the simulation and empirical studies are discussed in section [ simulation_section ] and section [ data_empirical_section ] respectively .",
    "section [ conclusion_section ] concludes the paper and discusses future work .",
    "this section provide a review of some realized measures and proposes the sub - sampled realized range .    for day @xmath0 ,",
    "representing the daily high , low and closing prices as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the most commonly used daily log return is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the associated volatility estimator .",
    "the high - low range ( squared ) , proposed by parkinson ( 1980 ) , proved to be a much more efficient volatility estimator than @xmath5 , based on the range distribution theory ( see e.g. feller , 1951 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 scales ra to be an approximately unbiased volatility estimator .",
    "several other range - based estimators , e.g. garman and klass ( 1980 ) ; rogers and satchell ( 1991 ) ; yang and zhang ( 2000 ) were subsequently proposed ; see molnr ( 2012 ) for a full review regarding their properties .",
    "the range allowing for overnight price jumps is proposed in gerlach and chen ( 2015 ) : @xmath8 where again the associated volatility estimator squares @xmath9 , then divides by @xmath7 .",
    "if each day @xmath0 is divided into @xmath10 equally sized intervals of length @xmath11 , subscripted by @xmath12 , several high frequency volatility measures can be calculated . for day @xmath0 , denote the @xmath13-@xmath14 interval closing price as @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the high and low prices during this time interval . then rv is proposed by andersen and bollerslev ( 1998 ) as : @xmath18^{2}\\ ] ] martens and van dijk ( 2007 ) and christensen and podolskij ( 2007 ) developed the realized range , which sums the squared intra - period ranges : @xmath19    through theoretical derivation and simulation , martijns and van dijk ( 2007 ) show that rr is a competitive , and sometimes more efficient , volatility estimator than rv under some micro - structure conditions and levels . gerlach and wang ( 2015 ) confirm that rr can provide extra efficiency in empirical tail risk forecasting , when employed as the measurement equation variable in an re - garch model . to further reduce the effect of microstructure noise , martens and van dijk ( 2007 ) presented a scaling process , as in equations ( [ rv_scale ] ) and ( [ rrv_scale ] ) .",
    "@xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the daily squared return and squared range on day @xmath0 , , respectively .",
    "this scaling process is inspired by the fact that the daily squared return and range are each less affected by micro - structure noise than their high frequency counterparts , thus can be used to scale and smooth rv and rr , creating less micro - structure sensitive measures .",
    "further , zhang , mykland and at - sahalia ( 2005 ) proposed a sub - sampling process , also to deal with micro - structure effects . for day @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath10 equally sized samples are grouped into @xmath24 non - overlapping subsets @xmath25 with size @xmath26 , which means : @xmath27 then sub - sampling will be implemented on the subsets @xmath28 with @xmath29 interval : @xmath30    representing the log closing price at the @xmath13-@xmath14 interval of day @xmath0 as @xmath31 , the rv with the subsets @xmath28 is : @xmath32    we have the @xmath33 rv with @xmath34 sub - sampling as ( supposing there are @xmath35 minutes per trading day ) :    @xmath36    then , denoting the high and low prices during the interval @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , we propose the @xmath33 rr with @xmath34 sub - sampling as : @xmath41 @xmath42    for example , the 5 mins rv and rr with 1 min subsampling can be calculated as below respectively : @xmath43 @xmath44",
    "the @xmath45 level expectile @xmath46 , defined by aigner , amemiya and poirier ( 1976 ) , can be estimated through minimizing the following expectation : @xmath47 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a continuous r.v .",
    ", @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 equals 1 when @xmath51 and @xmath52 otherwise . if @xmath53 , the following asymmetric sum of squares equation is employed for @xmath46 in taylor ( 2008 ) : @xmath54 so that minimizing this equation results in the asymmetric least squares ( als ) estimator of @xmath46 .",
    "no distributional assumption is required to estimate @xmath46 here .",
    "as discussed in section [ introduction_sec ] , es is defined as @xmath55 , which stands for the expected value of @xmath48 , conditional on the set of @xmath48 that is more extreme than the @xmath56-level quantile of y , denoted @xmath57 .",
    "newey and powell ( 1987 ) found a general relationship between the expectile and es : if @xmath58 , taylor ( 2008 ) showed this relationship can be formulated as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 ; i.e. @xmath46 occurs at the quantile level @xmath61 of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 can be used to estimate the @xmath56 level quantile @xmath57 , and then scaled to estimate the associated es .",
    "taylor ( 2008 ) proposed the care type models that have the similar form as the caviar type models ( engle and manganelli 2004 ) , i.e. symmetric absolute value ( sav ) , asymmetric ( as ) and indirect garch ( ig ) . here",
    "we present only the care - sav model :    * care - sav * : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the day @xmath0 return , and @xmath64 is the @xmath45 level expectile for day @xmath0 , while @xmath45 is removed from the notation for the reason of brevity .",
    "further , gerlach and chen ( 2015 ) employed the range in the care framework , simply replacing the lagged return in the care - sav model by the lagged intra - day range ; their paper found that the ra - care type models demonstrated superiority compared to the return - based care models .",
    "gerlach , chen , and lin ( 2012 ) extended the care model by adding a return equation and asymmetric gaussian ( ag ) errors , showing that the resulting maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) was equivalent to the als estimator .",
    "gerlach and chen ( 2015 ) extended this framework to a care - x model , allowing any realized measure to drive the care equation , though they only considered the range .",
    "the sav version of their model can be written :    * care - x - sav * @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the asymmetric gaussian distribution and @xmath67 is the realized measure at time @xmath0 . both the care - sav and care - x - sav can be estimated by als , or by maximum likelihood ( ml ) assuming the ag error distribution : these estimators are mathematically equivalent .",
    "thus , the ag is only employed so as to construct a quasi - likelihood function , that has its mode exactly coinciding with the als estimator , and that subsequently allows a bayesian estimator , as developed in gerlach , chen , and lin ( 2012 ) for care models and gerlach and chen ( 2015 ) for care - x models .",
    "these care - type models can all produce one - step - ahead forecasts of @xmath68 ( expectiles ) , which can be directly employed as var estimates , by an appropriate choice of @xmath45 ; more on this later .",
    "then , equation [ expectile_es_equation ] can be employed to scale these expectile forecasts to produce forecasts of es .",
    "this paper extends the care - x model class to incorporate a measurement equation , analogous to the realized garch class of models .",
    "the innovative realized - garch framework was developed in hansen _",
    "comparing to the conventional garch model , re - garch employs a measurement equation , which captures the contemporaneous connection between unobserved volatility and a realized measure of variance .",
    "the superiority of re - garch compared to garch has been demonstrated by several authors , including hansen _",
    "( 2011 ) , watanabe ( 2012 ) and gerlach and chao ( 2016 ) .    *",
    "re - garch * @xmath69 where the 3rd equation is the measurement equation . here",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 ; hansen _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) made several suggestions , including @xmath72 and focused on @xmath73 .",
    "watanabe ( 2012 ) further extended the model through incorporating the student - t or skewed - t ( hansen , 1994 ) for @xmath74 , also employed in gerlach and chao ( 2016 ) .",
    "the advantage of a measurement equation is that more information about the latent volatility can be incorporated into the likelihood .",
    "further , asymmetric effects of positive and negative return shocks on volatility are incorporated in an innovative manner .",
    "the proposed realized care model class , which adds both these features to the existing care - x framework , is now presented .",
    "consider a zero - mean return process with conditional distribution @xmath75 and conditional volatility at time t given by @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath56-level quantile is then given by @xmath77 , which in an expectile framework is also @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the dynamics on @xmath76 will imply the dynamics on the expectile series @xmath68 in a care model .",
    "further , the relationship between the realized measure @xmath67 and @xmath76 also implies a relationship between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we thus propose two realized care models implied by two sets of volatility dynamics .    under the volatility dynamics in ( [ rgarch ] ) , the indirect garch realized - care - ig is proposed , as follows :    * realized - care - ig ( re - care - ig ) * @xmath78 where @xmath79\\times100 $ ] is the percentage log - return for day @xmath0 , @xmath67 is the realized measure at time @xmath0 and it is sufficient for positivity under the square root to enforce @xmath80 . in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath81 as well as square roots of the scaled and sub - sampled versions of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "also , we make the standard choice @xmath84 for the measurement error .",
    "the top three equations in the realized - care above are named as : the _ return equation _ , the _ care equation _ and the _ measurement equation _ , respectively .",
    "the measurement equation here captures the contemporaneous dependence between the expectile @xmath68 and realized measure @xmath67 , analogous to capturing that between unobserved volatility and the realized measure in the re - garch framework .",
    "if the volatility dynamics are instead those of standard deviation garch , the implied realized - care - sav model is :    * realized - care - sav ( re - care - sav ) * @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and the choice @xmath84 is made here .",
    "there are two return - related `` error '' series in these re - care models : one is the additive @xmath88 , which is assumed to follow an ag distribution , so that the mle coincides with the als ( in care models ) ; the second is the multiplicative @xmath89 , that appears in the measurement equation and is employed to capture the well known leverage effect .",
    "again , if @xmath68 is a multiple of @xmath90 then , we will have @xmath91 , as usual , but to keep a zero mean asymmetry term @xmath92 , we need to know @xmath93",
    ". the re - care model says nothing about this second moment .",
    "thus , we instead substitute an empirical estimate @xmath94 , being the sample mean of the squared multiplicative errors .",
    "we note that @xmath95 is preserved if @xmath96 is an unbiased estimate .",
    "the term @xmath97 thus still generates an asymmetric response in volatility to return shocks .",
    "further , the sign of @xmath98 is expected to be opposite that from an re - garch model , since the expectile @xmath68 is negative for the low quantile levels , e.g. @xmath99 , considered in the paper .",
    "the re - care framework can be easily extended into other nonlinear care versions , e.g. by choosing the expectile dynamics in gerlach , chen and lin ( 2012 ) ; however we focus solely on the re - care - sav type models in this paper .    in order to guarantee that the series @xmath68 does not diverge ,",
    "a necessary condition for both re - care type models is @xmath100 , which is subsequently enforced during estimation .",
    "this condition can be derived through substituting the measurement equation into the care equation in either ( [ rcareig ] ) or ( [ rcaresav ] ) . the care equation in re - care framework can produce one - step - ahead expectile forecasts ( var ) , which can be mapped to es forecasts directly through employing equation ( [ expectile_es_equation ] ) .",
    "with @xmath101 , the als as specified in equation ( [ als_r_equation ] ) is employed by taylor ( 2008 ) to estimate @xmath64 , after the expectile level @xmath45 is estimated through a grid search : @xmath45 is chosen to make the in - sample violation rate ( @xmath102 ) as close as possible to the quantile level @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath103 for each grid value of @xmath45 , the als estimator of the care equation parameters @xmath104 is found , yielding an associated vrate(@xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath105 is set to the grid value of @xmath45 s.t .",
    "vrate is closest to the desired @xmath56 .",
    "then , the als estimator of @xmath106 conditional on @xmath107 is found .",
    "gerlach , chen and lin ( 2012 ) , gerlach and chen ( 2016 ) develop an asymmetric gaussian ( ag ) distribution and include it as the error distribution in an observation equation for a care model , i.e. @xmath108 in ( [ range_care_sav_equation ] ) .",
    "this makes the construction of a likelihood function feasible .",
    "the scale factor @xmath109 is a nuisance parameter and can be integrated out , gerlach , chen and lin ( 2012 ) employ a jeffreys prior in this integration and show that maximizing the resulting integrated likelihood function produces identical estimation as the als approach .",
    "however , the likelihood formulation also allows access to powerful computational bayesian approaches , such as adaptive mcmc algorithms , for estimation .",
    "the care ( integrated ) likelihood in this setting is : @xmath110      because the re - care framework has a measurement equation , with @xmath111 , the full log - likelihood function for re - care ( as in model [ rcaresav ] ) is the sum of the log - likelihood @xmath112 for the care equation and the log - likelihood @xmath113 from the measurement equation . in the re - garch framework",
    ", the measurement equation variable contributes to volatility estimation , thus the garch equation in - sample and predictive log - likelihood values are improved compared to the traditional garch .",
    "thus , we expect the measurement equation in the re - care to also facilitate an improved estimate @xmath45 and of @xmath64 , leading to more accurate var and es forecasts .    @xmath114    where @xmath115 is the measurement equation residual series , e.g. in the re - care - sav model ( [ rcaresav ] ) , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .    for the re - garch model framework , hansen _ et.al _",
    "( 2011 ) studied the asymptotic properties of the quasi - maximum likelihood estimator , conjecturing a central limit theorem .",
    "yao and tong ( 1996 ) considered the asymptotics of als estimation for expectile regression and showed consistency of the estimator .",
    "results from both these papers allow us to conjecture the consistency and asymptotic normality of the ml estimator obtained by numerically maximizing the log - likelihood function above .",
    "we leave the proofs for future work .",
    "however , convergence issues in the numerical likelihood optimization , to be discussed , lead us to instead consider mcmc estimation .      given a likelihood function , and the specification of a prior distribution , bayesian algorithms can be employed to estimate the parameters of an re - care model .",
    "a two - step adaptive bayesian mcmc method , extended from that in gerlach and wang ( 2016 ) is employed .",
    "first , the parameters are dived into two blocks : @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where groupings are chosen to maximize within group correlation of mcmc iterates ; e.g. here the stationarity constraint @xmath120 induces some correlation among the three parameters , whilst in garch models the equivalent of @xmath121 are known to be highly negatively correlated .",
    "priors are chosen to be uninformative over the possible stationarity ( and positivity , where relevant ) regions , e.g. @xmath122 , which is a flat prior for @xmath123 over the region @xmath124 .",
    "an adaptive mcmc algorithm , extended from that in gerlach and wang ( 2016 ) , based on that in chen and so ( 2006 ) , employs a random walk metropolis ( rw - m ) for the burn - in period and and independent kernel metropolis - hastings ( ik - mh ) algorithm ( metropolis et al . , 1953",
    "; hastings , 1970 ) for the sampling period",
    ". the burn - in period uses a gaussian proposal distribution for the random walk process of each parameter group .",
    "the covariance matrix of the proposal distribution in each block is tuned towards a target accept ratio of @xmath125 ( roberts , gelman and gilks , 1997 ) .",
    "then the ik - mh sampling period incorporates a mixture of three gaussian proposal distributions .",
    "the sample mean of the last 10% of the burn - in period samples are used as the proposal mean vector , while the sample variance - covariance matrix @xmath126 is employed so that the three gaussian proposal var - cov matrices are : @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 respectively , where @xmath126 is calculated as the covariance of the last 10% of the burn - in period samples , for each block .      as discussed in section [ care_likelihood_section ] ,",
    "the estimation of care type models relies on a full grid search of the optimal expectile level @xmath45 , e.g employing @xmath24 equally spaced trial values of @xmath45 on @xmath129 $ ] , as proposed in taylor ( 2008 ) .",
    "for each grid value of @xmath45 , the als estimator of the care equation parameters @xmath104 is found , yielding an associated vrate(@xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath107 is set to the grid value of @xmath45 s.t .",
    "vrate is closest to the desired @xmath56 .",
    "this paper extends that approach in three ways .",
    "first , the quantile loss function , equation ( [ q_loss ] ) , is proposed as a more suitable optimization criterion than the vrate , which e.g. may not detect autocorrelation in violations .",
    "further , since quantiles are elicitable , in the sense defined by gneiting ( 2011 ) , and the standard quantile loss function is strictly consistent , i.e. the expected loss is a minimum at the true quantile series , minimizing ( [ q_loss ] ) is a more reasonable choice to estimate @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the selected expectile level @xmath45 during the grid search should be the one that minimizes the quantile loss function : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a series of expectiles at level @xmath56 for the return observations @xmath132 .",
    "taylor ( 2008 ) and gerlach , chen , and lin ( 2012 ) both employed als during the expectile level grid search procedure .",
    "however , employing the same approach for the re - care model generates abnormal loss function values and tends to suffer from convergence issues . as an illustration ,",
    "consider the top plot in figure [ fig_vloss ] , showing the minimized quantile loss function values against the grid of values for @xmath45 in the re - care - sav model , for a simulated data set . though it is possible that a satisfactory estimate of @xmath45 is obtained",
    ", it is clear that an un - expectantly non - smooth function over @xmath45 results .",
    "our investigations showed that this non - smoothness , which occurred in all simulated and real datsets that we tried , was a result of intermittent non - convergence of the als optimization , using the optimization toolbox in matlab .",
    "further , when the optimization was changed to be via a genetic algorithm , only minimal improvements were made : in fact , the resulting plots were qualitatively the same and are thus not shown , to save space .",
    "therefore , the usual search procedure and optimization needs to be adjusted for re - care models .    as an alternative , and the second contribution here",
    ", we propose to employ a stochastic optimization algorithm , employing a fast rw - m approach , to allow improved accuracy in estimation of @xmath45 and convergence in estimating @xmath104 for each grid value of @xmath45 . for each value of @xmath45",
    "considered , the rw - m algorithm from the burn - in period of the full mcmc sampling scheme is employed to give a few thousand iterates of the parameters , and thus of the series @xmath133 , each of which is evaluated via the quantile loss function in ( [ q_loss ] ) , with the minimum loss over the iterates eventually chosen ; then @xmath105 the value of @xmath45 associated with the overall minimum of these minimum loss values over the grid of @xmath45 . to illustrate the improvement under this approach , the bottom plot of figure [ fig_vloss ] shows the relationship between @xmath45 and the corresponding minimum loss function , which is now quite smooth and regular , and importantly monotonic , with any remaining non - smoothness being due to the monte carlo error inherent in the rw - m stochastic search method .",
    "this sort of improvement is found in all data sets , simulated and real , that we tried .",
    "however , our approach is more time consuming since an mcmc run is required for each grid value of @xmath45 .",
    "re - care - rr @xmath45 full grid search with ml and rw - m approaches employ quantile loss function as objective function . ]",
    "the third contribution is to make the proposed method faster than a pure grid search , without sacrificing accuracy . to assist in speeding things up , we propose to find a smaller and more refined region than @xmath129 $ ] on which to do a more targeted grid - search , via the following two - step approach .",
    "first , a coarse grid search in undertaken and the results employed to identify a smaller area where the loss function is comparatively low , followed by a refined grid search inside that area .",
    "* proposed two - step target @xmath45 search approach * + * step 1 * : choose @xmath134 equally spaced values for @xmath45 , generated in @xmath135 $ ] ; we set @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , the latter chosen because the empirical study with full grid search shows @xmath105 is well always inside that region .",
    "the minimum loss function ( [ q_loss ] ) is calculated for these @xmath24 values , based on the rw - m search algorithm .",
    "for the first @xmath45 trial value @xmath139 , the rw - m is run for a minimum of 10,000 iterations , and a maximum 15,000 iterations , and is stopped if the maximum of the likelihood function has not changed for more than 1000 iterations ; typically this has occurred before the 10000th iterate . for the remaining @xmath140 values , say @xmath141 , ( @xmath142 ) the estimated mle of the parameters from @xmath143 are used as the mcmc starting values , and the rw - m is run for a minimum of 2,000 iterations , with a maximum of 10,000 iterations , and again stopped when the maximum of the likelihood has not changed for 1000 iterations ; this typically happens between 2000 and 4000 iterations .",
    "an example of the @xmath136 calculated loss function vs @xmath45 values from step 1 is presented in the top plot of figure [ fig_target_search ] , where @xmath144 generates the minimum loss function value and is selected .    *",

    "in this paper , the realized - care , a new model framework to estimate and forecast financial tail risk , is proposed . through incorporating intra - day and high frequency volatility measures , improvements in the in - sample expectile estimation accuracy ( compared to care model ) and out - of - sample forecasting of tail risk measures",
    "are observed , compared to re - garch models employing realized volatility , and traditional garch and care models , as well as forecast combinations of these models .",
    "specifically , re - care models with rao , rr and sub - sampled rr generate the most accurate var forecasts , while re - care models employing rr , scrv , subrv are the most accurate for es forecasting in the empirical study of nine financial return series .",
    "forecast combinations methods employing the mean and median of the forecasts also produce competitive tail risk forecasting results .",
    "regarding back testing of var forecasts , the re - care type models are also generally less likely to be rejected than their counterparts . regarding the var and",
    "es joint loss function values , re - care model s var and es forecasts consistently had lower loss than all other models considered , especially the re - care - rr and re - care - subrv models .",
    "the combined series `` fc - mean '' and `` fc - med '' are also highly competitive regarding this loss function .",
    "further , the model confidence set results also favour the proposed re - care framework , especially re - care - rr , re - care - subrv and re - care - subrr .",
    "in addition to being more accurate , the re - care models generated less extreme tail risk forecasts , regularly allowing smaller amounts of capital allocation without being anti - conservative or significantly inaccurate . the re - care type models with rr , sub - sampled rv , sub - sampled rr should be considered for financial applications when forecasting tail risk , and should allow financial institutions to more accurately allocate capital under the basel capital accord , to protect their investments from extreme market movements .",
    "this work could be extended by developing different re - care specifications , perhaps considering alternative distributions for the measurement equation , by using alternative frequencies of observation for the realized measures and extending the model to allow multiple realized measures and measurement equations , as per hansen and huang ( 2016 ) .",
