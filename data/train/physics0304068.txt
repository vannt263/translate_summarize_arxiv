    "this limit was obtained by fitting each sequence of @xmath341 data points with a fifth - degree polynomial .",
    "fits of the data points  ( [ eq : dataset1 ] ) with larger numbers of data points display more irregular estimate curves ; this can for instance be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : fit6points ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : fit9points ] .    as we have seen above",
    ", the uncertainty in the fitted value can be evaluated by visually prolongating the fitting curves ( i.e. , curves such as those of figs .",
    "[ fig : fit2ndpasslimits][fig : fit9points ] ) .",
    "another uncertainty must in general be taken into account in order to obtain a reliable estimate for the fitted quantity : the uncertainty in the data points .",
    "all the curves presented in this appendix do contain error bars that reflect the uncertainties in the estimates of  ( [ eq : limitexample ] ) that come from the uncertainties in the data points  ( [ eq : dataset1 ] ) .",
    "we evaluated the uncertainty associated to each fit of @xmath337  data points  ( [ eq : dataset1 ] ) by calculating three fits : a fit with the middle values of the ordinates , a fit with the higher values , and a fit with the lower values ; the three estimates of the fitted quantity  ( [ eq : limitexample ] ) obtained through this procedure define an estimate with an error bar ( see , e.g. , fig .  [ fig : fit9points ] ) .",
    "other ways of estimating the uncertainty in the fit result can be used ; a good choice of uncertainty evaluation yields successive estimates of the fitted quantity that are compatible with a smooth curve of estimates [ see , e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : fit9points ] , where the less precise estimates of limit  ( [ eq : limitexample ] ) lie in the prolongation of the more precise values , which are on the right of the plot ] .",
    "one of the advantages of the local - fit method presented in this appendix is that data points that are located far from the abscissa of interest ( @xmath333 , here ) can fruitfully be used in evaluating the fitted quantity [ limit  ( [ eq : limitexample ] ) , in our example ] .",
    "thus , as fig .",
    "[ fig : fit9points ] illustrates , data points  ( [ eq : dataset1 ] ) with `` large '' abscissas can yield more precise estimates of limit  ( [ eq : limitexample ] ) than data points with small abscissas .",
    "this behavior is particularly useful when data points in the region of interest have relatively large uncertainties .",
    "the procedure detailed in this appendix also allows one to study the quality of lists of numerical results that should lie on a smooth curve , but whose coherence is not obvious through a simple inspection or plot of the values . in fact , curves such as those found in figs .",
    "[ fig : fit2ndpasslimits][fig : fit9points ] can be very sensitive to small errors in a list of numerical values .",
    "we have not noticed such errors in the @xmath0 values of tables  [ tbl : a60p ] and  [ tbl : a60d ] while evaluating the asymptotic coefficients reported in table  [ tbl : asymptcoefs ] ; this provided an additional check of the values reported in these tables ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : check ] ) .    the local - fit method described here",
    "is not restricted to the asymptotic study of the bethe logarithm that we have used as an example . in general , it can yield precise estimates of quantities that are local to a set of data point [ such as limit  ( [ eq : limitexample ] ) ] , including , for instance , perturbation coefficients of non - analytic expansions [ e.g. , eq .",
