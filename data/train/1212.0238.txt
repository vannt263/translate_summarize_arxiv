    "the formation mechanism of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) is an important problem of modern astronomy ( e.g.  lin & mohr 2004 ; vonderlinden et al .  2007 ; hansen et al .",
    "2009 ; garijo , athanassoula , & garcia - gmez 1997 ; tutukov , dryumov , & dryumova 2007 ; jordn et al .",
    "some of the bcgs are cd  galaxies ( matthews , morgan , & schmidt 1964 ) which are characterized by an extended `` envelope '' or halo .",
    "the physical properties of these unique objects were reviewed e.g.  by tonry ( 1987 ) , kormendy & djorgovski ( 1989 ) , schombert ( 1992 ) and jordn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "according to one of the proposed scenarios , bcgs are formed in cluster cooling flows , when the gas density has grown enough to cool and condense , leading to star formation in the cluster core ( silk 1976 ; cowie & binney 1977 ; fabian 1994 ) . in this scenario",
    "there should be color gradients of the optical haloes in the sense that the latter should become redder with increasing radius .",
    "however , such gradients have not been found ( andreon et al .",
    "1992 ) . also ,",

    "2001 ; peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; tamura et al.2001 ) puts this possibility of cd formation in doubt .",
    "the second hypothesis on the formation of cds supposes a rapid merging of galaxies during cluster collapse ( e.g. , merritt 1983 ) .",
    "however , as merritt ( 1985 ) argues , the truncation of galaxy haloes during cluster collapse would lead to time scales for dynamical friction longer than a hubble time and thus  turn off \" subsequent evolution in the cluster , i.e.  the growth rates after the cluster s virialization are slowed down .",
    "also , according to simulations made by dubinski ( 1998 ) , the central galaxy does not develop the extended envelope that is characteristic of cd  galaxies .",
    "cd  galaxies which formed by the above - mentioned scenarios are expected to be located near to the centres of their host cluster and are expected to have a radial velocity close to the mean of the cluster galaxies . meanwhile ,",
    "some cds are located at an appreciable projected distance from the geometric centre of the cluster and their median absolute peculiar velocity with respect to their host cluster s mean velocity is @xmath227 per cent of the host cluster s velocity dispersion ( e.g.  oegerle & hill 2001 , coziol et al.2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "this fact poses problems for the mentioned mechanisms of formation of bcgs .",
    "the third hypothesis for the cd formation is _ galactic cannibalism _",
    "( ostriker & hausman 1977 ; searle , sargent & bagnuolo 1973 ; ostriker , & tremaine , 1975 ; hausman & ostriker 1978 ; white 1976 ; dressler 1980 ; barnes 1989 ; baier & schmidt 1992 ; garijo et al .",
    "it appears to be the one that is most compatible with observational evidence . according to this mechanism , cds",
    "are formed as a result of galaxies falling in along primordial filaments and their subsequent merging ( e.g.  west et al .",

    "; torlina et al .  2007 ) . the weak trend of the optical major axis of the bcgs to be aligned with their parent clusters major axes ( binggeli 1982 ;",
    "struble 1987 ; rhee & katgert 1987 ; lambas , groth , & peebles 1988 ) supports the hypothesis of the formation of the former as a result of hierarchical merging ( niederste - ostholt et al .",
    "mergers of red galaxies , apparently without significant merger - triggered star formation ( dry mergers ) , have been observed at low redshift ( e.g.  van dokkum 2005 ) . according to aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , gao et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , delucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) , the stellar mass of bcgs grows by a factor of between 3 and 4 via mergers since @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been argued ( e.g.  merritt 1985 ; tremaine 1990 ) that the observed dominance of bcgs can not be achieved via cannibalism of other cluster members , since the high velocity dispersion of clusters makes frequent merging of galaxies unlikely . by studying the surface brightness and color profiles of a few cd  galaxies and analysis of their globular cluster systems jordn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) concluded that cds appear to have formed rapidly ( e.g. , dubinski 1998 ) at early times , via hierarchical merging prior to cluster virialization .",
    "a related mechanism for formation of cds involves tidal stripping by cluster galaxies which pass near the cluster centre .",
    "the stripped material falls to the centre of the potential well and may form the halo of the giant galaxy there ( gallagher & ostriker 1972 ; richstone 1975 , 1976 ) .",
    "garijo et al.(1997 ) mention that this theory can not explain , however , the difference between central dominant cluster galaxies with and without a prominent halo , and that the velocity dispersion of stars in cd haloes is three times smaller than the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "so this theory has a difficulty in explaining why the tidally stripped material is slowed down as it builds up a cd halo .    in this paper",
    "we present arguments in favour of the cannibalism model of the formation of cd  galaxies .",
    "we look for correlations between the cd  luminosity and its host cluster parameters , including the number of its members , which was not considered in other models .",
    "our emphasis is on the formation of cd  galaxies in clusters of bautz - morgan ( bm ) type  i ( bautz & morgan 1970 ) , since the performed analysis is applicable only to clusters with a single dominant galaxy . for comparison we considered a sample of clusters containing cd  galaxies as well as one or more other galaxies of comparable luminosity , and call the latter clusters `` non - bmi type '' ( or nbmi in what follows ) .",
    "the observational data we used allows us to suggest that clusters of bmi and nbmi types have different evolution histories .",
    "in the analysis presented here we looked for possible correlations between the @xmath0-band luminosity of cd  galaxies on the one hand , and the cluster richness and the velocity dispersion on the other . for the selection of clusters we started out from the compilation of bcgs in abell clusters ( abell et al .",
    "1989 ) by coziol et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , using clusters of any bm  type containing a cd  galaxy , but restricting ourselves to clusters with redshift @xmath4 . in compiling our list",
    "we excluded all supplementary s - clusters , and exluded most clusters that had more than one significant redshift components along the line of sight .",
    "we required that the mean redshift be based on at least five spectroscopic members .",
    "however , in the analysis involving the cluster velocity dispersion @xmath5 we only used those clusters with at least 10 cluster member redshifts .",
    "we took the cluster velocity dispersions @xmath5 from the most recent version of the abell cluster redshift compilation maintained by one of us ( see andernach et al .",
    "2005 for a description ) .",
    "a few velocity dispersions were taken from a recent analysis by zhang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "we used the abell number count , @xmath6 , as an indicator of the cluster richness .",
    "@xmath6 is the number of galaxies in the magnitude range between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath7 is the apparent photored magnitude of the third - brightest cluster member , located within one abell radius , @xmath9 , of the cluster centre , where @xmath10 .",
    "the values of @xmath6 were taken from abell et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and were mostly based on estimated redshifts used to determine the abell radii .",
    "thus we understand that @xmath6 is not a precise measure of the cluster richness .",
    "nevertheless , it is an appropriate parameter , since it gives the number of galaxies in the central region of a cluster where merging of galaxies preferentially takes place .",
    "for those clusters which had other significant components at different redshift along the line of sight , we corrected the abell count @xmath6 downwards , in proportion to the number of measured redshifts in the component containing the cd  galaxy , as compared to the number of redshifts in all components along the line of sight ( see the values marked with an asterisk in column  6 of table  1 below ) .",
    "in our study we considered separately the bmi type clusters with a dominant cd  galaxy and nbmi clusters . according to bautz & morgan ( 1970 )",
    "the bmi clusters are defined as _",
    "clusters containing a centrally located cd galaxy_. in bmii types the brightest galaxies _ are intermediate in appearance between class cd and the virgo - type giant ellipticals_. bmiii types were defined as _",
    "clusters containing no dominant galaxies_. we introduced a quanitative criterion to differentiate between clusters .",
    "we assumed a cd  galaxy as dominant and the cluster as of bmi type , if the cd s @xmath0-band magnitude was brighter than the second - brightest cluster member by @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity of the brightest galaxy 2.5  times higher than that of the second - brightest galaxy .",
    "when this `` luminosity gap '' was less than a factor of 1.9 , i.e.  the @xmath0-band magnitude difference was less than @xmath12 , we assumed that the cluster was of nbmi type . to avoid the ambiguity of finding the second - brightest galaxy in a cluster we imposed a lower limit of 0.035 for the cluster redshift . since the clusters with a luminosity gap between the first and second - brightest galaxy in the range @xmath13 may belong to either of the bmi or nbmi classes , we omitted these intermediate clusters .",
    "we list the luminosity gap @xmath14 between the cd and 2nd - brightest cluster member in column  4 of table  1 .    for the determination of the cd  galaxy luminosity we used the @xmath15 apparent magnitude from the 2mass extended source catalogue ( jarrett et al .",
    "the 2mass magnitudes have been widely used in galaxy studies ( e.g.  temi , brighenti , & mathews 2008 ; courteau et al .  2007 ; masters , springob , & huchra , 2008 , etc .",
    "the @xmath0  band is more appropriate for our study , since it encompasses the light of the predominantly red population in early - type galaxies .",
    "note that lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that 2mass photometry is free from possible errors which may be caused by the sky background subtraction and crowding .",
    "the most important inconsistency may be produced by the extrapolation scheme to generate  total magnitudes \" ( jarrett et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "lin & mohr ( 2004 ) used a correction scheme to extrapolate isophotal magnitudes to  total \" magnitudes and showed that both schemes are consistent .",
    "bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) mentioned that 2mass magnitudes have problems in detecting the low surface brightness light , such as haloes of cd  galaxies ( e.g.  schombert 1988 ) .",
    "in addition , lauer et al .  ( 2007 ) demonstrated that 2mass photometry is likely to underestimate the total light from cds .",
    "however , it is obvious that the errors in the 2mass @xmath0-magnitudes may not create correlations of absolute magnitude @xmath16 with the corresponding cluster parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , which also are determined with some errors .",
    "the errors may only increase the dispersion and thus dilute or even destroy the correlations we are seeking .",
    "the absolute stellar magnitudes @xmath16 of the cd  galaxies were deduced using the mean redshift of their host cluster ( andernach et al .",

    "we found that clusters of bmi and nbmi types have different properties that give clues to their different evolution histories .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0-band luminosity of cd  galaxies on the host cluster richness expressed by the abell number count @xmath6 is stronger in bmi clusters ( cf .",

    "also the cd  galaxy luminosity hosted in bmi clusters depends on the cluster velocity dispersion , @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath31 , and the slope of the regression line is @xmath51 .",
    "meanwhile , the cd  luminosity in nbmi clusters does not depend on the host cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "the correlations of the cd  luminosity with the parent cluster parameters for bmi clusters allow us to suggest that cd  galaxies in these clusters were formed and evolved preferentially within one and the same cluster .",
    "the absence of the cd  luminosity correlations with the parent cluster parameters for nbmi type clusters shows that the cd  galaxy in them was formed in a cluster that is in the process of merging with another cluster , or has already merged with other groups or clusters .",
    "the parameters of the composite cluster will obviously differ from those of the _ initial _ cluster in which the cd  galaxy was formed , and correlations observed in bmi clusters will be weakened or erased in composite nbmi clusters .",
    "also , the velocity dispersion of the composite cluster will not be proportional to the cluster mass .",
    "we suppose that the luminosity of the cd  galaxy formed in the initial cluster would fit the correlations seen in figures  3 an 4 .",
    "merging of other groups and clusters with the initial cluster will increase the richness and velocity dispersion of the resulting observed cluster , while the luminosity of the cd  galaxy will remain the same .",
    "the richer and more massive the initial cluster is , ( and consequently the brighter the formed cd  galaxy ) , the more groups will merge with it , the larger will be the increase of richness and velocity dispersion , and the farther to the right from the regression line determined by bmi clusters in figures  3 and 4 the corresponding point will be located . as a result , the slope of the regression line of @xmath16 vs.  @xmath6 for nbmi clusters will decrease . since the correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath29 for bmi clusters is generally weaker , the correlation for nbmi clusters even disappears .",
    "the steeper slope of the regression line for nbmi clusters in figure  5 also favours the suggestion made on the different evolution histories of bmi and nbmi clusters .",
    "merging of groups and clusters with the initial cluster will increase the richness and velocity dispersion of the observed cluster .",
    "if the mean velocity of member galaxies of merged groups differs significantly from that of the initial cluster , the increase of the velocity dispersion will obviously be stronger than the increase in richness .",
    "therefore , the slope of the regression line for nbmi clusters in the graph @xmath52 becomes steeper than for bmi type clusters .",
    "the cluster(s ) that merge with the initial cluster ( forming the cd ) are generally poorer , and their brightest galaxy will usually be fainter than the cd  galaxy in the initial cluster",
    ". however , it is possible that the luminosity of the bcg in the cluster that merges with the initial one is comparable to , or even brighter than that of the cd  galaxy",
    ". this may be the case for some nbmi clusters in our sample ( a1736b , a2051 , a2969 ) where the cd  galaxy is even fainter than the brightest galaxy formed in the merged ( currently seen ) cluster .",

    "dependence of the cd  galaxy luminosity on its peculiar velocity _ + figure  6 shows that the luminosity of the cd  galaxy in clusters of bmi type increases with the peculiar velocity of the cd  galaxy , while it shows the opposite trend in clusters of nbmi clusters .",
    "a different dependence of the cd  luminosity on its peculiar velocity in clusters of bmi and nbmi clusters is explained within the assumed model of a different evolution of bmi and nbmi clusters .",
    "we suggest that the increase of the cd  galaxy luminosity hosted in bmi clusters may be explained in the following way .",
    "the cd  galaxy may be formed not at the exact gravitational centre of the corresponding cluster and will oscillate about it ( quintana & lawrie , 1982 ) .",
    "the higher the velocity of its movement , the more chances it will have to encounter with other members of the cluster and the larger will be the number of galaxy mergers . therefore ,",
    "cds with higher peculiar velocity become more luminous .",
    "this fact favours the cannibalism model of the cd galaxy formation .",
    "we found that the cd  luminosity hosted in bmi clusters depends on the cluster richness ( cf .",
    "fig .  4 ) .",
    "obviously the same must be the case in the initial cluster that later became of nbmi type after its merging with other groups or clusters .",
    "the poorer the initial cluster , the fainter will be the formed cd  galaxy . at the same time",
    ", the richer the merged cluster , the higher will be the peculiar velocity of the cd  galaxy , since the mean redshift of the merged cluster will differ more from the redshift of the initial cluster .",
    "therefore , the fainter the cd  luminosity , the higher may be its peculiar velocity , which is consistent with fig .",
    "this supports the conclusion we made on the different evolution histories of clusters of bmi and nbmi types .",
    "we note also that cd  galaxies in nbmi clusters may be located far from the bottom of the gravitational well of the cluster .",
    "the projected separation of the bcg from the x - ray peak of the corresponding cluster was measured by hudson et al .",
    "among the brightest galaxies with a large separation there are clusters common to our list : a0754 , a1736 and a3376 with separations of 714 , 642 and 939  kpc , respectively .",
    "the first two are of nbmi type , and the third one , a3376 , by its @xmath65 value is close to an nbmi cluster , but for the sake of reliability , we excluded this cluster from our analysis . hence , this fact also supports the suggested hypothesis on different evolution of bmi and nbmi clusters .",
    "the difference of merging efficiency on cluster richness and velocity dispersion _",
    "+ according to all models of cd  galaxy formation , the cd  luminosity depends on the parent cluster mass .",
    "this is the case when the cd was formed in the cluster cooling flow or by a rapid merging of galaxies during cluster collapse . according to the cannibalism model , the higher the cluster mass",
    ", the stronger will be the gravitational force towards the cluster center , and consequently more member galaxies will be attracted to the central area and may be cannibalized .",
    "the mass of a cluster may be estimated from its velocity dispersion .",

    "below we show that the cluster richness is more decisive for the formation of a cd  galaxy .",
    "the luminosity of the cd  galaxy depends on the richness @xmath6 of the host cluster .",
    "according to the regression line in figure  4 , an increase of @xmath16 by one magnitude from @xmath66 to @xmath67 in bmi clusters corresponds to an increase of @xmath6 from 16 to 138 .",
    "according to the regression line in figure  5 , an increase of @xmath6 from 16 to 138 corresponds to an increase of @xmath5 from 468  kms@xmath18 to 840  kms@xmath18 , i.e.  by 1.8  times .",
    "if the effectiveness of the cluster richness and the velocity dispersion for the formation of the cd  galaxy are about the same , we may expect that for an increase of the luminosity from @xmath66 to @xmath67 the velocity dispersion must increase by about 1.8  times .",
    "however , the regression line in figure  3 shows that for such an increase of @xmath16 the velocity dispersion increases in fact from 190  kms@xmath18 to 1340  kms@xmath18 , i.e.  by 7.1  times .",
    "this means that the cluster richness is by @xmath68 times more effective for the cd  formation than the velocity dispersion which is commonly used to estimate the cluster mass .",
    "this finding strongly favours the cannibalism model of the cd  galaxy formation .",
    "the higher the bmi cluster richness , the more of its members may be cannibalized , and the more luminous will be the resulting cd  galaxy .",
    "hence , the cluster richness , i.e.  the number of member galaxies , plays a more decisive role in the cd  formation than the cluster mass determined by velocity dispersion .",
    "models for cd  formation other than the cannibalism scenario do not differentiate between the mass of the cluster and the number of its members .    it is evident that in nbmi clusters the luminosity of the cd  galaxy formed in the initial cluster may not depend on the parameters of the ( presently ) observed cluster formed as a result of merging of the initial cluster with other galaxy groups or clusters .",
    "rough estimate of the number of galaxies merged to form the cd _ + suggesting that cd  galaxies were assembled through the so - called dissipationless `` dry '' mergers of gas - poor , bulge - dominated systems ( tran et al .",
    "2005 ; van dokkum 2005 ; bell et al .  2006 ; de lucia et al .  2006 ;",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ) we roughly estimate the number @xmath69 of merged galaxies required to form the observed cd .",
    "dry mergers are consistent with the high central densities of ellipticals and their old stellar populations .",
    "if mergers are responsible for the formation of bcgs , then , as has been shown by several authors ( malumuth & richstone 1984 and references therein ) , the luminosity growth will be at the expense of fainter members .",
    "assuming that the merged galaxies are ordinary faint galaxies , with an absolute magnitude @xmath70 ( see tovmassian , plionis & andernach 2004 ) for isolated e / s0 galaxies , we estimate that the faintest cd with @xmath71 are formed by the assembly of only about 13 galaxies with a mean luminosity of an isolated e / s0 galaxy . the most luminous cds with @xmath72 are formed by merging of about 80 ordinary e / s0 galaxies .",
    "the rate of galaxy merging in poor and rich clusters _ + merritt ( 1985 ) and tremaine ( 1990 ) showed that the efficiency of merging depends on the cluster velocity dispersion @xmath5 in the sense that a high velocity dispersion will prevent frequent merging . in agreement with this ,",
    "forman & jones ( 1982 ) , and schombert ( 1987 ) mentioned that a cluster with a lower velocity dispersion would have a higher rate of mergers .",
    "we compared the velocity dispersion @xmath5 of clusters of bmi type located near to the lower and upper envelopes of the @xmath73 distribution in figure  1 .",
    "the mean @xmath5 for 7  clusters with the least luminous cds and known @xmath5 ( a0912a , a1076 , a1227a , a2110 , a2170b , a2544 , a3104 ) is @xmath74kms@xmath18 .",
    "these clusters are poor .",
    "their mean @xmath6 is @xmath75 .",
    "the mean @xmath5 for 12 clusters with the most luminous cds in figure  1 ( a0085a , a0399 , a0655 , a0690a , a1146 , a1644 , a1738 , a2420 , a2457 , a3112b , a3571 , a4059 ) is @xmath76kms@xmath18 .",
    "the mean @xmath6 of these clusters is @xmath77 .",
    "the mwu two - tailed tests show that the difference of the velocity dispersion @xmath5 of these two subsamples is highly significant @xmath78 = 0.0128 ) .",
    "hence , the process of merging is fast in poor clusters of bmi type with small velocity dispersion .",
    "the situation is different in clusters of nbmi type , where no difference of @xmath5 of clusters with the most and least luminous cd  galaxies is observed .",
    "the mean @xmath5 of the 12 nbmi clusters hosting most luminous cd  galaxies ( median @xmath79 ) is @xmath80kms@xmath18 and that of the 9 clusters with the least luminous cd  galaxies ( median @xmath81 ) is @xmath82kms@xmath18 .",
    "the evolution of cd  galaxies in rich and poor clusters _",
    "+ the evolution of cd  galaxies in bmi clusters may be followed in the frames of the adopted cannibalism model in figure  1 .",
    "our figure  2 suggests that clusters at low redshift are poorer on average .",
    "however , part if this can be explained by the fact that rich clusters are rare and the local volume is small .",
    "since the velocity dispersion of poor clusters is small , the process of merging in them is fast . at the same time , the reservoir of galaxies for merging is also small .",
    "therefore , the process of luminosity increase in cd  galaxies in poor clusters terminates in a relatively short time , and it may reach only a modest luminosity . the final stage of poor clusters may be a fossil group ( tovmassian 2010 ) . thus , cd  galaxies in nearby poor clusters almost reached their possible maximum , rather low luminosity .",
    "the mean @xmath6 of the five poorest bmi clusters with @xmath83 ( a0912a , a1308a , a2271 , a0376 , a1890 ) is @xmath84 , and that of the five poorest clusters in our highest distance range ( @xmath85 ; a0038 , a1023 , a1068 , a1076 , a3854a ) is @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the distant poor clusters are relatively rich , the process of cannibalism in them probably still continues , and cds in these clusters did not yet reach their possible maximum luminosity .",
    "the situation is different in rich clusters .",
    "the velocity dispersion of rich clusters is high .",
    "therefore , the rate of merging in rich clusters is low and lasts longer also due to the larger reservoir of candidate galaxies for merging .",
    "the cd  galaxies in rich clusters slowly move up in figure  1 , occupying almost uniformly the space from the smallest to the highest luminosities in each redshift range .",
    "thus , the upper envelope of this distribution may be explained without invoking the malmquist bias , but simply by the fact that cds are observed in clusters of different richness and assuming cannibalism for their formation    hence , the observational data favour the cannibalism model of the cd galaxy formation . we conclude that cd  galaxies in clusters of bmi type were formed and evolved in one and the same cluster .",
    "we suggest also that cds in nbmi clusters were originally formed in poorer cluster and are observed now in clusters that were formed by merging with other galaxy groups and clusters .",
