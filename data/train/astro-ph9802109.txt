    "observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide one of the key constraints for cosmological models and a significant quantity of experimental data already exists . by comparing the power spectrum of the cmb fluctuations derived from these experiments with the power spectra predicted by different cosmological models it is possible to set constraints on the value of certain cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys , mapping large scale structure ( lss ) , provide another cosmologically important set of observations .",
    "the clustering of galaxies in redshift - space is systematically different from that in real - space ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mapping between the two is a function of the underlying mass distribution , in which the galaxies are not only tracers , but also velocity test particles ( @xcite ) .",
    "many techniques have been developed for estimating this mapping ( @xcite ) .",
    "statistical quantities can be generated for a given cosmology and these used to constrain model parameters through comparison with survey data ( @xcite ) .",
    "estimates derived separately from each of these two data sets have problems with parameter degeneracy . in the analysis of lss data ,",
    "there is uncertainty as to how well the observed light distribution traces the underlying mass distribution . the light - to - mass linear bias , @xmath18 , introduced to account for this uncertainty , affects the value of many central cosmological parameters , and makes any identified optimum degenerate ( @xcite ) . similarly , on the basis of cmb data alone",
    ", there is considerable degeneracy ( @xcite ) between @xmath19 and the energy density @xmath20 due to the cosmological constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to poor estimation of the baryon ( @xmath21 ) and total mass ( @xmath0 ) densities ( @xcite ) .    in this letter , we combine results from a bandpower approach covering a range of cmb experiments , with a likelihood analysis of the iras 1.2jy survey , performed in spherical harmonics .",
    "we present a self - consistent formulation of cmb and lss parameter estimation .",
    "in particular , our method expresses the effects of the underlying mass distribution on both the cmb potential fluctuations and the iras redshift distortion .",
    "this breaks the degeneracy inherent in an isolated analysis of either data set , and places tight constraints on several cosmological parameters .",
    "indeed , it is unsurprising that the two data sets are complementary , given that they sample our universe at extreme ends of its evolution . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our attention to inflationary , cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , assuming a flat universe with linear , scale - independent biasing .",
    "other recent studies which combine cmb and lss include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of cmb fluctuations by the cobe satellite ( @xcite ) , several other experiments have also measured cmb anisotropies over a wide range of angular scales .",
    "these experiments include ground - based beam - switching experiments such as tenerife ( @xcite ) , python ( @xcite ) , south pole ( @xcite ) and saskatoon ( @xcite ) ; balloon - borne instruments such as argo ( @xcite ) , max ( @xcite ) , and msam ( @xcite ) and the ground - based interferometers cat ( @xcite ) and ovro ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations have resulted in a first estimate of the cmb power spectrum and they are discussed in more detail by @xcite . in particular , hancock et al .",
    "display the window function @xmath22 for each experiment and convert the level of anisotropy observed in each case to flat bandpower estimates @xmath23 centered on the effective multipole @xmath24 of the corresponding window function ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting cmb data points are plotted in fig .",
    "[ cmbdata ] , together with their 68 per cent confidence limits .",
    "these confidence limits have been obtained using likelihood analyses and hence incorporate uncertainties due to random errors , sampling variance ( @xcite ) and cosmic variance ( @xcite ) .",
    "a discussion of possible additional uncertainties due to contamination by foreground emission is given by @xcite .",
    "the data points plotted in fig .",
    "[ cmbdata ] differ slightly from those given in @xcite as follows .",
    "the old python point has been replaced by two new points corresponding to the py iii@xmath25 and py i , py ii and py iii@xmath26 observations respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tenerife point has been updated following the analysis of the full two - dimensional data - set and a detailed treatment of atmospheric effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "the saskatoon points have been increased by 5 per cent , as suggested by the recent investigation of systematic calibration errors in the saskatoon experiment ( leitch , private communication ) .",
    "we have added the results from the second cat field , reported in @xcite and also the ovro point reported by @xcite .",
    "temperature fluctuations in the cmb are usually described in terms of the spherical harmonic expansion @xmath27 from which we define the ensemble - average cmb power spectrum @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , we may describe the fluctuations in terms of their autocorrelation function @xmath29 the power in the cmb fluctuations observed by an experiment with window function @xmath22 is then given by @xmath30 and for each experiment we define the flat bandpower by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is defined ( @xcite ) as @xmath33 this flat bandpower estimate is centred on the effective multipole @xmath34 we wish to compare these bandpower estimates with those predicted by different cosmological models .",
    "varying the values of model parameters , we calculate corresponding , predicted cmb power spectrum @xmath35 , using the boltzmann code of @xcite .",
    "this is then used to calculate the predicted flat bandpower @xmath36 for each experiment . the chi - squared statistic for a given set of parameter values , @xmath37 , is then @xmath38_i -\\left[\\delta t_l^{\\rm pred}({\\alphacmb})\\right]_i \\right)}^2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the number of cmb data points plotted in fig .",
    "[ cmbdata ] ( 20 in this analysis ) .",
    "moreover , since the cmb data points plotted in fig .",
    "[ cmbdata ] were chosen such that no two bandpower estimates come from experiments which observed overlapping patches of sky and had overlapping window functions , we may consider them as _ independent _ estimates of the cmb power spectrum . as the cosmic variance has already been taken into account in deriving the flat bandpower estimates , the likelihood function",
    "is given simply by @xmath40 .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume that the universe is spatially flat , and that there are no tensor contributions to the cmb power spectrum .",
    "we take the primordial scalar perturbations to be described by the harrison - zeldovich power spectrum for which @xmath41 , and further assume that the optical depth to the last scattering surface is zero .",
    "the normalisation of the cmb power spectrum is determined by @xmath2 , which gives the strength of the quadrupole in @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the average cmb temperature .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe is given by hubble s parameter @xmath45 , while @xmath46 and @xmath21 denote the density of the universe in cdm and the baryons respectively , each in units of the critical density .",
    "given that we assume a flat universe , but investigate models where @xmath47 the shortfall is made up through a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath48 such that @xmath49 furthermore , we restrict our attention to models that satisfy the nucleosynthesis constraint @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we consider the reduced set of cmb parameters @xmath50 in section 4 , we derive a set of joint parameters linking these to the iras parameter set .",
    "the iras surveys are uniform and complete down to galactic latitudes as low as @xmath51 from the galactic plane .",
    "this makes them ideal for estimating whole - sky density and velocity fields . here",
    ", we use the 1.2 jy iras survey ( @xcite ) , consisting of 5313 galaxies , covering 87.6% of the sky with the incomplete regions being dominated by the 8.7% of the sky with @xmath52 .    in principle",
    ", the method we are using can be extended to account explicitly for the incomplete sky coverage .",
    "however , we adopt the simpler approach of smoothly interpolating the redshift distribution over the missing areas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of this interpolation on the computed harmonics have been shown to be negligible ( @xcite ) .      in this letter , we assume linear , scale - independent biasing , where @xmath4 measures the ratio between fluctuations in the iras galaxy distribution and the underlying mass density field : @xmath53 we note that biasing may be non - linear , stochastic , non - local , scale - dependent , epoch - dependent and type - dependent ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . for a linear bias parameter , @xmath4 , the velocity and density fields in linear theory ( @xcite ) are linked by a proportionality factor @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 statistically , the fluctuations in the real - space galaxy distribution can be described by a power spectrum , @xmath56 , which is determined by the _",
    "rms _ variance in the observed galaxy field , measured for an 8  radius sphere ( @xmath57 ) and a shape parameter ( e.g. @xmath58 in equation  [ eqngamma ] ) .",
    "the observed @xmath57 is related to the underlying @xmath59 for mass through the bias parameter , such that @xmath60 .",
    "the approach we use in this letter follows fisher , scharf & lahav ( 1994 ; hereafter fsl ) , and we include here only a brief introduction to our technique .",
    "fsl provides a detailed description of the spherical harmonic approach to parameter estimation .",
    "a flux - limited , redshift - space density field can be decomposed into spherical harmonics @xmath61 , with coefficients @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of galaxies in the survey , and @xmath64 is an arbitrary radial weighting function  this process is analogous to fourier decomposition , but instead using spherical basis functions .",
    "the sum over galaxies in this equation can be rewritten as a continuous integral of the density fluctuation field @xmath65 over redshift - space : @xmath66 \\ , y_{lm}(\\hat\\bfs ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the radial selection function of the survey , evaluated at the real - space distance of the @xmath68 galaxy .    as detailed in fsl , assuming the perturbations introduced by peculiar velocities are small , the expected linear theory values for the harmonic coefficients are @xmath69 here , @xmath70 is the real - space window function , while @xmath71 is a `` correction '' term which embodies the redshift distortion .    for a given set of cosmological parameters , redshift - space harmonics",
    "@xmath72 can be calculated for different weighting functions @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",

    "in addition to the @xmath78 from equation  [ almeqn ] , these predicted harmonics will also have a shot - noise contribution @xmath79 due to the discreteness of survey galaxies .",
    "note that the argument of the exponent in equation  [ iraslike ] is simply @xmath80 , and that here the normalisation of the likelihood function does depend on the free parameters ( unlike in the cmb likelihood function ) .    in this letter ,",
    "we follow fsl and use four gaussian windows centered at 38 , 58 , 78 , and 98  each with a dispersion of 8 . for each window ,",
    "we compute the corresponding weighted redshift harmonics for the iras 1.2jy catalog , and use these to determine the likelihood of a given set of parameter values . since our analysis is valid only in the linear regime , we restrict the likelihood computation to @xmath81 ( corresponding to 120 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "hence , the iras likelihood function has a parameter vector @xmath82 again , the linkage between these and the cmb parameters is discussed in section 4 below .",
    "given the large number of parameters available between the two models , it is important both to find links for joint optimisation , and to decide which parameters can be frozen . from section 3 , we have six variables between the two models : \\{@xmath2 , @xmath83 , @xmath46 , @xmath84 , @xmath57 , @xmath58}. these can be reduced further by expression in terms of core cosmological parameters .",

    "<S> observations of large scale structure ( lss ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) each place separate constraints on the values of cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a joint likelihood based on various cmb experiments and the iras 1.2jy galaxy redshift survey and use this to find an overall optimum with respect to the free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our formulation self - consistently takes account of the underlying mass distribution , which affects both the cmb potential fluctuations and the iras redshift distortion . </S>",
    "<S> this not only allows more accurate parameter estimation , but also removes the parameter degeneracy which handicaps calculations based on either approach alone . </S>",
    "<S> the family of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models analysed corresponds to a spatially - flat universe with an initially scale - invariant spectrum and a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> free parameters in the joint model are the mass density due to all matter ( @xmath0 ) , hubble s parameter ( @xmath1 ) , the quadrupole normalisation of the cmb power spectrum ( @xmath2 ) in @xmath3k , and the iras light - to - mass bias ( @xmath4 ) . throughout the analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the baryonic density ( @xmath5 ) is required is to satisfy the nucleosynthesis constraint @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> results from the two data sets show good agreement , and the joint optimum lies at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath3k , and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the 68 per cent confidence intervals are : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . for the above parameters the normalisation and shape of the mass power - spectrum are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the age of the universe </S>",
