    "high resolution quasar absorption line spectroscopy has enabled the statistical detection of intergalactic metals at cosmic overdensities as low as @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "the inferred metallicities are around @xmath7 , with lines associated with a substantial fraction of forest lines with @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "additional metal lines , such as ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) are also detected in the low density intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "observations indicate metallicity increases with density ( @xcite ) and the distribution of metals in the igm is inhomogeneous ( @xcite ) .    a crucial ingredient in many of these studies are the ionisation corrections which convert the observed ionic abundances to metallicities .",
    "these corrections depend on the density and temperature of the igm , as well as the intensity and spectral shape of the metagalactic ultra - violet background ( uvb ) .",
    "the former may be modelled using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations which follow the enrichment history of the igm ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is usually calculated using detailed models for the uvb intensity and spectral shape ( @xcite ) .",
    "simulations of intergalactic metal enrichment typically assume the metagalactic ionising radiation field is spatially uniform .",
    "this is expected to be a reasonable approximation for hydrogen ionising photons at @xmath9 , when the mean free path of ionising photons is much larger than the average separation between ionising sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the epoch of reionisation is thought to complete around @xmath6 , when quasars are numerous enough to provide the hard photons ( @xmath10 ) needed to doubly ionise helium ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , observations of the and forest indicate the uvb spectral shape fluctuates significantly on scales of @xmath11 mpc at these redshifts , producing a wide range of values for the to column density ratio , @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these fluctuations are thought to arise from the small number of quasars lying within the short ( ionising photon ) mean free path expected at the tail - end of reionisation ( @xcite ) , although small scale radiative transfer effects ( @xcite ) , collisionally ionised gas ( @xcite ) or a significant number of thermally broadened lines ( @xcite ) may also produce column density ratios with @xmath13 .",
    "these spatial inhomgeneities in the uvb spectral shape should also have an impact on the ionisation balance of the metals in the igm . ) to quasars at @xmath14 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this line - of - sight proximity effect arises because of the @xmath15 dependence of the ionisation radiation _ intensity _ around the quasar when the igm is optically thin , and it will manifest itself even after reionisation has long completed .",
    "this effect is slightly different to the large scale fluctuations in the uvb _ spectral shape _ discussed here , which are expected to be important toward the tail - end of reionisation when the ionising photon mean free path is small . ]",
    "intriguingly , independent of the spectral shape of the ( spatially uniform ) uvb used to make ionisation corrections , several studies find evidence for scatter in the igm metallicity at fixed density ( @xcite ) .",
    "this scatter may be intrinsic , or it may instead be partially attributable to spatial fluctuations in the spectral shape of the uvb .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find little evidence for inhomogeneity in the @xmath16 $ ] they infer from the observed optical depth ratio @xmath4 , implying that spatial variations in the uvb spectral shape are small .",
    "there is also some evidence from metal line analyses for a hardening of the uvb spectrum at @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , perhaps due to the onset of reionisation .",
    "however , other studies are consistent with no evolution at the same redshifts ( @xcite ) . quantifying the effect of a spatially inhomogenous uvb on intergalactic metal absorption lines",
    "is thus desirable , both as a potential probe of reionisation and for examining the systematic bias , if any , spatially uniform ionisation corrections impart to constraints on the distribution of metals in the igm .",
    "analytical arguments have previously highlighted the importance of small scale fluctuations in the hydrogen ionising radiation field for metals associated with high column density systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , there has been no detailed examination of the impact of a spatially inhomogeneous uvb at @xmath10 on metals associated with lower column densities .",
    "a self - consistent treatment would require multi - frequency cosmological radiative transfer in a large ( @xmath17 ) volume coupled to a detailed chemodynamical model .",
    "in contrast , current state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations of igm metal enrichment generally assume a spatially uniform uvb ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , but see @xcite ) while large cosmological radiative transfer simulations of reionisation are still restricted to a treatment of hydrogen and helium only ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we instead use a comparatively simple model which includes most of the relevant aspects of the spatially inhomogeneous uvb expected towards the tail - end of reionisation ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we combine this model with a large hydrodynamical simulation of the igm to explore the impact of spatial fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape on intergalactic carbon and silicon at @xmath18 . in particular , we focus on the ratio of to absorption , which is sensitive to the shape of the uvb either side of the ionisation edge ( @xcite ) .",
    "we describe our hydrodynamical simulation and model for spatial fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the four toy uvb models we use in this work . in section 4",
    "we proceed to examine the impact of spatial fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape on synthetic absorption spectra constructed from our simulations .",
    "we compare our results to observational data in section 5 , and conclude in section 6 .",
    "all atomic data is taken from @xcite , solar abundances are from @xcite and all distances are given in comoving units .",
    "we use the r4 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation described in @xcite to model the igm density field .",
    "the simulation was performed in a @xmath19 mpc box with @xmath20 particles using the parallel tree - sph code gadget-3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we use a snapshot drawn from the simulation at @xmath27 .",
    "our model for spatial fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape is similar to the approach described by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the model applies to fluctuations in the uvb spectrum at the tail - end of reionisation only , following the overlap of regions when the ionising photon mean free path is set by the abundance of lyman limit systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is good evidence to suggest that reioniation is indeed completing by @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , and this assumption should therefore be reasonable .",
    "note , however , that the model will not apply to the patchy ionisation state of the pre - overlap igm during the early stages of reionisation at @xmath28 , and does not include the effect of detailed , small scale radiative transfer effects on the igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "further modelling will thus be required to address the impact of spatial variations in the uvb spectral shape on intergalactic metals during the heart of reionisation .",
    "firstly , to create a volume large enough to contain several ionising photon mean free paths , we stack the hydrodynamical simulation volume around the original @xmath19 mpc box to create a cube @xmath29 on each side .",
    "we identify haloes in the volume using a friends - of - friends halo finder .",
    "quasar luminosities are assigned to the haloes by monte carlo sampling the @xcite b - band quasar luminosity function at @xmath18 .",
    "the luminosities are uniquely mapped to the halo masses by rank ordering both quantities and assigning the brightest quasars to the most massive haloes .",
    "this approach enables us to distribute sources on large scales while following the ionisation state of gas in detail in the central @xmath19 mpc box .",
    "however , it will only approximately model the clustering properties of the sources .",
    "fortunately , the rarity of bright quasars means that poisson fluctuations rather than clustering is expected to dominate the resulting uvb fluctuations ( @xcite ) , so this limitation is unlikely to significantly affect our results .",
    "we require the number of quasars in a volume , v , to satisfy    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the @xcite quasar luminosity function",
    ". the lower limit of the integral is @xmath32 , corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "the b - band luminosity of each quasar is converted into a luminosity below the lyman limit using a broken power law spectrum ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )    @xmath34    we consider two cases for the extreme uv ( euv ) spectral index , @xmath35 . in the first case",
    "we assume a constant value of @xmath36 , consistent with the mean obtained by @xcite for radio quiet quasars , @xmath37 . however , a wide range of values are measured for the euv spectral index ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we also consider a variable euv spectral index .",
    "scatter in @xmath35 is included by monte - carlo sampling a gaussian with mean @xmath38 and standard deviation @xmath39 over the range @xmath40 , similar to the dispersion measured by @xcite .    once the luminosity and spectral energy distribution for each quasar is specified , the specific intensity of the uvb , @xmath41 @xmath42 $ ] , at frequencies between the and ionisation edges , @xmath43 , is given by    @xmath44    the sum is made over all quasars in the @xmath29 volume , where @xmath45 is the distance of quasar @xmath46 from @xmath47 , which is always in the central @xmath48 box .",

    "this expression assumes quasars are point sources surrounded by discrete , poisson distributed absorbers ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath55 , following the analogous distribution for absorbers ( @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , the slope of the column density distribution is not constrained observationally and may deviate from the distribution for absorbers associated with high column densities , @xmath56 ( @xcite ) . finally , in this work we model the contribution to the uvb from quasars only . the non - thermal emission from quasars is thought to dominate the uvb at @xmath57 , but star forming galaxies will make an increasingly significant contribution to the uvb at lower frequencies at @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the soft spectra of these sources are unlikely to significantly contribute to spatial fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape at @xmath10 .",
    "the four toy uvb models used in this work are summarised in table 1 .",
    "the models are constructed by evaluating eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : jhe2 ] ) on a @xmath58 grid within the central @xmath59 simulation box",
    ". the size of each grid cell , @xmath60 mpc , is chosen to match the scales of @xmath11 mpc on which the to optical depth ratio is observed to vary at @xmath61 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this choice also represents the best compromise between resolution and efficiency ; the construction of the photo - ionisation balance look - up tables ( see section  [ sec : makespec ] ) becomes very time consuming if the number of grid cells much larger .",
    "however , note that the rarest , high amplitude fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape on small scales will not be fully captured in the simulation . in each grid cell",
    "the specific intensities are evaluated at @xmath62 different photon energies spanning the range @xmath63 .",
    "lastly , all four models are renormalised by a factor of @xmath64 to give identical mean specific intensities at the ionisation edge @xmath65 .",
    "this renormalisation yields photo - ionisation rates of @xmath66 ( cf .",
    "@xmath67 prior to the renormalisation ) , consistent with observational constraints derived from the forest opacity at @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .    models uvb1 and uvb2 are constructed using a single euv spectra index , @xmath36",
    ". however , the value of the mean free path at the ionisation edge , @xmath52 , is rather uncertain . in this work",
    "we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath68 at @xmath18 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , but the exact value will depend on the to column density ratio , @xmath69 , which exhibits significant fluctuations approaching @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thus also consider a smaller mean free path for model uvb2 , @xmath70 , consistent with the constraints recently presented by @xcite at @xmath6 . model uvb3 instead uses a variable euv spectral index and @xmath71 mpc .",
    "the final model , uvb4 , is identical to model uvb1 , aside from the spectral shape between @xmath72 and @xmath73 ryd .",
    "resonant absorption due to lyman series lines will also produce significant spatial fluctuations in the uvb between at @xmath74 and the ionisation edge at @xmath75 ( @xcite ) .",
    "model uvb4 mimics these fluctuations by assuming the uvb spectrum computed with eqs .",

    "the spectra recover their intrinsic shape at high energies , where the photon mean free path is long and the attenuation of the radiation by the intervening absorbers is negligible .",
    "model uvb3 , which assumes a variable euv spectral index , is much harder than the other models at high energies .",

    "[ fig : uvbspectra ] again displays model uvb1 , but the dotted curves now show the range encompassing 95 per cent of all fluctuations around the median specific intensity .",
    "fluctuations are largest close to the ionisation edge where the attenuation of the radiation is strongest , while towards higher frequencies the increasing mean free path produces much smaller departures from the median . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed line shows the widely used uvb model of @xcite ( hm01 ) for emission from galaxies and quasars at @xmath18 .",
    "the spectrum has been renormalised to match the specific intensity of uvb1 at @xmath85 .",
    "the softness parameter of the hm01 spectrum is @xmath86 , around @xmath87 lower than uvb1 . although the features of the toy uvb spectra presented here are broadly similar to the more detailed model of hm01 , there are some important differences .",
    "in particular , our toy models do not include more complex effects such as recombination emission ( @xcite ) or sawtooth absorption by the lyman series ( @xcite ) which are important to consider when performing detailed modelling of observational data .",
    "the fluctuations in the specific intensity are quantified in more detail in fig .",

    "somewhat counter - intuitively , the variable euv spectral index model ( uvb3 ) produces fewer of the large , rare fluctuations from the mean than uvb1 , which assumes a constant @xmath35 but is otherwise identical .",
    "this is because the three quasars which lie closest to the centre of our simulation volume ( and hence dominate the rare , high amplitude fluctuations ) have randomly assigned euv spectral indices which conspire to reduce fluctuations in the specific intensity at @xmath75 .",
    "recall the quasar luminosities are normalised in the b - band , and in this instance the euv spectra for the three closest quasars all have @xmath89 .",

    "the lack of a clear correlation with density , obtained from a voigt profile analysis of synthetic absorption spectra was systematically higher in regions where @xmath93 compared to regions with lower optical depths ( and hence densities ) .",
    "they suggested this implied the fluctuating uvb model they used was harder in higher density regions .",
    "however , this interpretation is in disagreement with our findings here .",
    "this earlier result is likely spurious , and probably results from the assumptions of pure turbulent broadening in the voigt profile analysis ( @xcite ) and a spatially uniform photo - ionisation rate . ]",
    "is mainly due the low number density of bright quasars , resulting in a radiation field which varies on scales much larger than the jeans scale ( see the discussions in _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . note , however , that fluctuations on scales @xmath94 ( typically those associated with the radiation field in close proximity to the quasars ) will be smoothed over , but these fluctuations are also rather rare . on the other hand , if additional physics such as small scale radiative transfer effects are important , or if ionising sources are far more numerous ( _ e.g. _ galaxies ) , the ionising radiation field may be more closely correlated with the igm density on small scales .",
    "we now turn to examine the impact of our spatially inhomogeneous uvb models on synthetic quasar absorption spectra .",
    "we use a simple _ a posteriori _ approach to including metals within our hydrodynamical simulation .",

    "however , additional heating from feedback is not included in our hydrodynamical simulation , and we thus likely underpredict the amount of and absorption due to collisionally ionised gas .",

    "this is illustrated by the thin curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionfrac ] , which are computed for gas with @xmath167 ; this temperature lies toward the upper range of the scatter observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : trho ] .",
    "secondly , only values of @xmath181 ( lower right panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] ) are readily observable in our synthetic spectra , which from eq .",
    "( [ eq : convert_tau ] ) corresponds to @xmath182 .",
    "thirdly , the range of @xmath161 fluctuations will in practice be smaller than indicated by the range of @xmath183 shown by the shading in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionfrac ] . fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape are _ maximised _ at @xmath75 where the mean free path is shortest ( _ e.g. _ fig .",
    "[ fig : uvbspectra ] ) , whereas and have ionisation potentials above and below @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuations do not have an equal probability of occurring in this range , and have a higher probability of lying close to the median ( _ e.g. _ fig .  [ fig : flucpdf ] ) .",
    "the shaded regions thus correspond to an upper limit in the expected @xmath161 variation for each model .    with these points in mind ,",
    "the @xmath161 ratio nevertheless shows only modest variation ( @xmath184 dex ) over the shaded range in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionfrac ] for @xmath163 , with the largest variations occurring for uvb2 and uvb4 . towards larger @xmath169 ( _ i.e. _ softer spectra ) , @xmath161 noticeably flattens for all models , and becomes almost constant for uvb1 , uvb2 and uvb3 .",
    "larger variations in @xmath161 do occur at lower densities , especially for model uvb3 where the to ratio changes by @xmath185 dex within the shaded range for @xmath186 .",
    "the to optical depth ratio for _ all _ pixels in fig .  [ fig : ratios ] is slightly broader than the uniform case for uvb3 at low values as a consequence .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : convert_tau ] ) we infer that and absorption from such low density gas is not detectable in the synthetic spectra .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionfrac2 ] the individual carbon ( upper panels ) and silicon ( lower panels ) ionisation fractions for several different ions are shown against @xmath169 .",

    "the left panels display the results for uvb2 , while uvb4 is shown on the right .",
    "models uvb1 and uvb3 display similar behaviour to uvb2 within the equivalent ranges for @xmath169 .",
    "note the and fractions for model uvb2 are largely insensitive to the uvb spectral shape for @xmath188\\ga 2 $ ] and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "this is because the uvb is very soft , resulting in photo - ionisation rates that are too low to significantly change the and fractions in the higher density gas responsible for most of the absorption . on the other hand ,",

    "consequently , as the ionising photon mean free path becomes smaller toward higher redshift , the average uvb spectral shape softens and variations in the _ observed _ to ratio do not become significantly more pronounced as a result of spatial fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape .",
    "the and absorption systems typically originate from overdense regions with @xmath190 in our simulations , where the and fractions change less rapidly with increasing @xmath169 compared to lower density .",
    "it is this behaviour , combined with the smaller fluctuations expected in the uvb spectral shape at frequencies above and below the ionisation edge , which explain the similarity between the to optical depth ratios for the uniform and fluctuating models in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the to ratio , where the same spatial variations in the uvb spectral shape significantly increase fluctuations in @xmath2 from lower density gas as the mean free path is lowered ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of any observational evidence for fluctuations in the @xmath4 ratio ( or the inferred silicon to carbon ratio ) is thus not necessarily indicative of a spatially uniform uvb at @xmath6 . on the other hand , slightly larger @xmath4 fluctuations are expected at lower densities , although the weaker absorption from these regions is much more difficult to detect .",
    "we now examine whether uvb fluctuations can be detected statistically in the observational data , and whether or not they contribute to the observed scatter in the igm metallicity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pixel optical depth ( pod ) procedure provides a powerful tool for statistically analysing metal absorption at low gas densities ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , the procedure involves recovering optical depths for a base transition ( _ e.g. _ absorption ) on a pixel - by - pixel basis and pairing these with metal optical depths recovered at the same redshift . given suitable calibration ,",
    "typically achieved using a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation , information may then be derived on the abundance and distribution of metals in the igm .",

    "@xcite and @xcite noted this scatter may be attributable to spatial variations in the metallicity of the igm , although they did not rule out the possibility that spatial fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape ( and hence the assumption of a uniform ionisation correction ) may also play a role . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite performed a pod analysis for and found no evidence for additional scatter in the @xmath3 ratio beyond the aforementioned scatter in the metallicity .",
    "the study concluded that a uniform @xmath192 $ ] is favoured and that inhomogeneities in the spectral shape of the uvb are small .",

    "for the pod analysis we construct absorption spectra which resemble high resolution , high signal - to - noise observational data ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",

    "continuum fitting errors are mimicked by performing an iterative continuum correction to the synthetic spectra . we compute the median transmitted flux in each synthetic line - of - sight and deselect all pixels below @xmath196 of this value , where @xmath197 is the rms noise amplitude in each pixel .",
    "the median flux is computed again for the remaining pixels , and the procedure is then continued until convergence is reached .",
    "the results of our pod analysis are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : pod ] .",
    "the data points with 1@xmath197 error bars in the left panel correspond to the @xcite observational measurements for q1422@xmath198230 .",

    "the curves display the recovered pixel optical depth against optical depth for spectra constructed using model uvb4 , which we find has the largest impact on the recovered optical depths .",
    "the solid curves are obtained from the spatially inhomogeneous uvb model , while the dotted curves corresponds to the optical depths recovered from the spatially averaged spectrum .",
    "the curves are almost indistinguishable , indicating that the predicted spatial inhomogeneities in the uvb spectral shape approaching reionisation will not significantly impact on the ionisation correction for c@xmath108 .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed curves in fig .  [ fig : pod ] use the spatially uniform uvb model , but now also include different assumptions for the lognormal scatter in the igm metallicity at fixed density .",
    "the dashed curves assume zero scatter , @xmath202 , while the dot - dashed curves correspond to @xmath203 .",
    "the impact on the recovered optical depths is especially prominent for the higher percentiles , suggesting that spatial variations in metallicity rather than the uvb spectral shape will dominate any scatter . as noted by @xcite , the fiducial model with @xmath101",
    "is in somewhat better agreement with the higher percentiles .    in the right hand panel",
    "we compare the same model to the pod measurements for and presented by @xcite for the same quasar .",
    "again , the recovered optical depths are very similar for the spatially inhomogeneous and uniform uvb models , and scatter in the metallicity has a much larger impact on the recovered optical depths .",
    "the fiducial model with @xmath101 is again in better agreement with the higher percentiles , although the agreement is poorer for the median .",
    "note also , in contrast to the and pixel optical depths , lognormal scatter in the metallicity at fixed density _ lowers _ each percentile for @xmath204 as a function of @xmath150 .",
    "the explanation for this behaviour is that scatter in metallicity is added to _ both _ of the pixel optical depths , in contrast to the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pod ] . adding this scatter enables the detection of both and absorption in more pixels at lower densities due to their higher metallicities",
    "; these pixels are otherwise hidden in the flat ( noise and continuum error dominated ) part of the correlation at @xmath205",
    ". however , for this uvb model the fraction ( and hence optical depth ) decreases more rapidly with decreasing gas density relative to the fraction .",
    "consequently , a greater fraction of optical depths with low @xmath204 are now _ detectable _ , leading to the lowering of the @xmath204 percentiles observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pod ] .    finally , we caution the reader not to take the differences between the observational data and simulations too seriously ; the @xcite and @xcite metallicities we have used to construct our spectra are derived under the assumption of a different uvb model .",
    "there is therefore no reason to expect our model to match the data exactly using these metallicities ; the comparison here is instead largely illustrative and one may always fine tune the metallicity to enable a given uvb model to match the data .",
    "the key point is that we clearly expect variations in the _ spatial distribution _ of metals to dominate any scatter in the and optical depths at fixed density , even in the presence of the spatially inhomogeneous uvb expected at the tail - end of reionisation .",
    "we use a large hydrodynamical simulation of the igm combined with a toy model for spatial inhomogeneities in the uvb spectral shape to investigate the impact of spectral hardness fluctuations on the ionisation balance of intergalactic carbon and silicon at @xmath6 .",
    "we construct synthetic quasar absorption spectra from the simulations , assuming the metallicity of the igm traces the underlying gas density ( @xcite ) .",
    "we carefully examine the impact of the uvb fluctuations on the and optical depths .",
    "four different spatially inhomogeneous uvb models which employ a variety of different assumptions for the uvb spectral shape are considered in our analysis .",
    "we reconfirm that fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape expected at the tail - end of reionisation have a significant impact on the to optical depth ratio ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , some of the lowest values for this ratio also result from lines which are predominantly thermally broadened ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , while the to ratio is indeed sensitive to the average spectral shape of the uvb , we find the predicted fluctuations have little impact on @xmath4 measured in our synthetic spectra .",
    "the majority of the detectable and absorption in our synthetic spectra originates from regions with @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "these absorbers are predominantly photo - ionised in our simulations , and we may thus exclude collisional ionisation as a possible explanation for the small impact of uvb fluctuations on our simulated spectra .",
    "instead , we find the ratio of observable to optical depths varies relatively little considering the wide range of fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape .",
    "this is in part because of the longer mean free path for photons above and below the ionisation edge , which results in smaller fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape at these frequencies .",
    "however , as fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape become larger as the opacity increases , the spatially averaged uvb spectral shape becomes softer ; uvb models which produce the largest fluctuations in @xmath2 also have photo - ionisation rates which are too low to have a significant impact on the observed to ratio . at lower gas densities , or for uvb models which predict a larger fraction of relative to ( _ e.g. _ for lyman series absorption ) , the expected variation in the to ratio can be slightly larger , but it is more difficult to detect due to the correspondingly smaller gas densities and/or fraction of triply ionised carbon produced .    finally , we briefly examine the observational consequences for studies of the igm metallicity using and absorption at @xmath6 .",
    "we perform a pixel optical depth analysis on our synthetic spectra , and find that the predicted uvb hardness fluctuations will have little impact on observations compared to spatial variations in the igm metallicity .",
    "we conclude that the lack of any observed fluctuations in the @xmath4 ratio does not provide a stringent limit on the non - uniformity of the uvb spectral shape , and in particular does not preclude the possibility of reionisation completing around @xmath1 . on the other hand , we confirm the observed scatter in the igm metallicity inferred from and absorption @xmath1 is likely to be intrinsic , reinforcing its potential as a powerful constraint on intergalactic metal enrichment scenarios .",
