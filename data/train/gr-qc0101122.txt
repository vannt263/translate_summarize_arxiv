    "in the treatment of the motion of _ extended _ bodies in classical field theory , the derivation of radiation reaction forces is based upon certain expansions of the retarded field potentials in powers of the retardation  @xcite .",
    "the resulting local equations of motion involve derivatives of the acceleration and generally suffer from the existence of unphysical runaway solutions . under certain model circumstances ,",
    "we trace the origin of these problems to the expansion of the functions of the retarded arguments resulting in the replacement of the original nonlocal delay equations of motion by local higher - derivative equations that exhibit runaway solutions . in this general context",
    ", the properties of the delay equations that appear in classical field theory were first studied by l.  bel  @xcite .",
    "although our approach is rather general , for the sake of concreteness we discuss physical situations involving only the gravitational interaction .",
    "consider , for instance , inspiraling compact binaries that are expected to be promising sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "for a binary that is comprised of two compact objects  neutron stars or black holes  with , say , approximately equal masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 in nearly circular orbits about each other , the relative orbital radius decays because orbital energy is emitted in the form of gravitational radiation .",
    "the dynamics of a usual binary system can be adequately described using the post - newtonian approximation scheme that is valid in case the gravitational field is everywhere ` weak ' and the motion is slow , that is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the characteristic orbital speed and @xmath4 is the speed of light .",
    "although einstein s equations have a hyperbolic character associated with the retarded gravitational interaction , the standard post - newtonian approximation scheme of general relativity deals with functions of instantaneous coordinate time @xmath5 rather than the retarded time @xmath6 , where ( for the binary system ) @xmath7 is the effective distance between the bodies ( approximately the relative orbital radius ) .",
    "the gravitational potentials , which are originally functions of the retarded time , are expanded in taylor series about @xmath5 using the effective small parameter in this expansion that can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the relative orbital frequency and @xmath10 is the binary period . because the gravitational waves emitted by the binary have an effective frequency of @xmath11 and wavelength @xmath12 , the small parameter in the expansion",
    "can be reduced to the ratio @xmath13 . due to the observational fact",
    "that in typical astronomical systems @xmath14 , the first few terms of such an expansion can be used to derive the post - newtonian equations of motion that describe , for instance , the orbital evolution of the binary pulsars discovered by hulse and taylor  @xcite .",
    "the post - newtonian equations of motion of binary stars are similar to the abraham - lorentz form in electrodynamics  @xcite but , because of the tensorial character of the gravitational field , these equations involve not only the third , but the fourth and fifth derivatives of the stars positions with respect to time as well .",
    "schematically , the equation of the relative orbital motion reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radius vector connecting the stars , the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time , @xmath17 and per reduced mass @xmath18 is the newtonian force , @xmath19 is the post - newtonian force , @xmath20 is the post - post - newtonian force and @xmath21 is the gravitational radiation reaction force responsible for the decay of the orbital period ( @xmath22 ) associated with the emission of gravitational waves by the binary system . in the quadrupole approximation under consideration here ,",
    "the gravitational waves carry away energy and angular momentum , but not linear momentum  @xcite ; therefore , the total momentum of the binary system is conserved and this fact is responsible for the absence of a force term proportional to @xmath23 in  .",
    "moreover , all tidal , spin - orbit , and spin - spin interactions are neglected in  ; the only parameters in equation   are the masses and the separation between the centers of mass of the members of the binary system .",
    "we mention that relativistic hydrodynamical ( euler ) equations similar to system   have been derived to describe the motion of the fluid elements of the stars  @xcite .",
    "the higher time - derivative equations of the form   can not be used directly to predict the dynamical evolution of a physical system because of the existence of so - called runaway modes that have been much discussed in the literature on electrodynamics but not in connection with astrophysical problems involving gravitational radiation reaction and the calculation of templates of the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing binaries  @xcite .",
    "in analogy with electrodynamics , the existence of these runaway modes suggests that the truncated equations of the form   may not correctly predict the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the original true dynamical delay - type equations  @xcite that involve the retarded time @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the existence of runaway modes can cause serious difficulties for numerical integration in addition to the problems associated with the inaccuracies inherent in the approximation of higher - order derivatives by finite differences  @xcite .    in case",
    "the post - newtonian expansion parameter @xmath24 is sufficiently small , we will provide in the following section a theoretical basis for eliminating the runaway solutions by replacing system   with a new model that is a system of second - order ordinary differential equations .",
    "within this theory , high - order vector differential equations like equation   are not the desired approximate equations of motion , and they should not be used for numerical integration . rather , system   must be viewed merely as an intermediate step in the derivation of the physically correct , second - order model equation with no runaway solutions that faithfully approximates the dynamics of the underlying delay - type equation . for illustration purposes , we apply this approach in section  [ sec:3 ] to a discussion of one - dimensional gravitational dynamics of a two - body system .",
    "as expected , the reduced model predicts the correct motion of the binary except possibly when @xmath24 is not small and residual terms that have been neglected in equation   start to play a significant role .",
    "indeed , for an inspiraling binary system , the effective delay @xmath25 increases to some noticeable finite value as the system approaches coalescence .",
    "motivated by this physical scenario , we introduce a simple model involving variable delay in section  [ sec:4 ] that can be expressed as a duffing - type differential - delay equation .",
    "this model is then analyzed to show some specific behavior of this delay equation that is not predicted by expansion in powers of the delay .",
    "finally , section  [ sec:5 ] contains a discussion of our results .",
    "the delay - type equations of motion with retarded arguments are usually too complicated for mathematical analysis ; therefore , we limit our discussion in this section to equations with constant delays . although this is an unrealistic restriction in general , we note that for an astrophysical binary system consisting of compact point - like neutron stars or black holes moving around each other along circular orbits , the delay is almost constant .",
    "in fact , a close approximation to this delay is the ratio @xmath26 , where @xmath7 , the radius of the relative orbit , is changing very slowly due to the emission of gravitational energy in the form of gravitational waves .",
    "taking into account the last remark , let us consider a family of delay differential equations of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is viewed as a real dimensionless parameter and @xmath29 is a variable in @xmath30 ; intuitively , the constant delay @xmath28 corresponds in effect to @xmath31 .",
    "the members of this family are examples of a more general and widely studied class called retarded functional differential equations ( see  @xcite ) .    using the delay equation   as an abstraction for the retarded - time model that is supposed to be approximated by a system of the form",
    ", we will discuss an approach for extracting the ` correct ' dynamical equations of motion from system   that eliminates the runaway solutions .",
    "our approach assumes the existence of an attractor for the underlying delay - type equation .",
    "we will rely on the work of bel  @xcite for ( numerical ) evidence in favor of the existence of attractors in the retarded equations of motion with space - dependent delays that appear in electrodynamics ; but , we know of no mathematical proof for the existence of attractors for these equations or for the similar delay - type equations of astrophysics .",
    "indeed , the proof of the existence of attractors for delay - type equations with space - dependent delays remains a challenging mathematical problem of physical significance . for the delay equation  , however , if @xmath32 is sufficiently small , then the corresponding member of the family",
    "has a global @xmath33-dimensional attractor such that the restriction of the delay equation to this attractor is equivalent to a first - order system @xmath34 of ordinary differential equations .",
    "we will eventually outline a proof of this result .",
    "but , let us first discuss our approach to eliminating the runaway solutions .    the solutions of the delay equation   approach the attractor exponentially fast ; therefore , the system @xmath34 on this attractor determines ( asymptotically ) the true dynamical behavior of the system , hence we consider it to be the ` correct ' physical model .",
    "on the other hand , it is easy to see that if equation   is expanded in the small parameter @xmath28 and truncated at some order @xmath35 , then an @xmath35th - order ordinary differential system @xmath36 akin to system   is obtained such that the coefficient of the @xmath35th - order time derivative of @xmath29 contains the factor @xmath37 and is therefore singular in the limit as @xmath38 .    for @xmath39 and sufficiently small",
    ", the high - order differential equation @xmath36 has an equivalent first - order system @xmath40 that has an @xmath33-dimensional ( invariant ) slow manifold .",
    "moreover , this slow manifold has corresponding stable and unstable manifolds ; in effect , the first - order system has ( physical ) solutions that are asymptotically attracted to the slow manifold and ( unphysical or runaway ) solutions that are asymptotically repelled from the slow manifold .",
    "the restriction of the first - order singularly perturbed system of differential equations to its slow manifold is of course an @xmath33-dimensional first - order system of ordinary differential equations @xmath41 on this @xmath33-dimensional manifold .",
    "our main result states that _ in appropriate local coordinates , the system @xmath41 on the slow manifold agrees to order @xmath35 in @xmath28 with the first - order system @xmath34 on the global attractor of the underlying delay differential equation ; therefore , the system @xmath41 , which can be obtained directly from the high - order differential equation @xmath36 , is a faithful approximation of the ` correct ' physical model . _",
    "generalizing to the abraham - lorentz type equation   ( analogous to @xmath36 ) , the correct physical model is obtained as the system of ordinary differential equations ( analogous to @xmath41 ) that determines the motion on the slow manifold of a corresponding first - order system that is viewed as being singularly perturbed relative to the small parameter @xmath24 .    while there is evidence that the mathematical assertions in the scenario just proposed are valid , some of these assertions have not yet been rigorously justified in full generality , even for the case of fixed delays . in the remainder of this section",
    "we will provide some evidence , in the case of fixed delays , for the existence of a global attractor and for the claim that the dynamical system on this attractor is well approximated by the dynamical systems on the slow manifolds of singularly perturbed first - order systems obtained by truncations of the expansion of the delay equation in powers of the delay .",
    "our approach for the elimination of runaway solutions is equivalent to the procedure of iterative reduction ( also called order reduction ) that is often used to eliminate runaway solutions by means of the evaluation of the higher time - derivative terms in equations like ( [ 5der ] ) by the repeated substitution of the equations of motion and the subsequent reduction of the resulting equation to one of the second order ( cf .",
    "thus , our approach provides a theoretical framework for the rigorous justification of iterative reduction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , a procedure that has been justified so far by physical intuition .    for _ conservative _ higher time - derivative systems ,",
    "the order reduction procedure has been investigated within the frameworks of lagrangian and hamiltonian dynamics by a number of authors ( see  @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that under suitable conditions  relevant , for instance , to euler - lagrange equations analogous to equation   truncated at the fourth order  higher - derivative lagrangians can be iteratively reduced by redefinitions of position variables  @xcite .",
    "returning to the delay equation  , we note that it has an infinite - dimensional state space of initial conditions .",
    "for example , if the delay @xmath28 is a fixed positive number , then the natural state space of initial conditions is the infinite - dimensional vector space of continuous @xmath30-valued functions on the interval @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "this space endowed with the supremum norm is a banach space that we will denote by @xmath43 .",
    "note that for an arbitrary continuous @xmath30-valued function @xmath44 defined on the interval @xmath45 $ ] , the function @xmath46 given by @xmath47 is in @xmath43 . under the assumption that @xmath48 is a smooth function and @xmath49",
    ", there is a unique continuous solution @xmath50 of the corresponding delay equation in the family   such that @xmath50 is uniquely defined for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath53 is defined to be the function @xmath54 in @xmath43 .    to see",
    "that there is an attractor for the family   in case @xmath28 is sufficiently small , it is convenient to introduce the fast time @xmath55 , valid for @xmath56 , so that with @xmath57 the family   takes the form @xmath58 and each member of this family , parametrized by @xmath28 , has the same state space  the continuous functions on the interval @xmath59 $ ] . for each @xmath56",
    "the delay equation   is equivalent to the corresponding member of the family  .",
    "for @xmath60 the corresponding differential equations are not equivalent , but this is of no consequence because we are only interested in the solutions of the family   for @xmath56 . by viewing the unperturbed system  , namely @xmath61 , as a delay equation with unit delay ,",
    "it is clear that the solution with initial state @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 on the interval @xmath59 $ ] and by the constant @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the initial state in @xmath43 thus evolves at time @xmath66 to its final constant state , the function defined on the interval @xmath59 $ ] with the constant value @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath33-dimensional space of constant functions on @xmath59 $ ] is a global attractor for the delay equation @xmath61",
    ". moreover , the convergence to this attractor is faster than any exponential ( the solution reaches the attractor in finite time ) , and the dynamical system on this attractor is given by the ordinary differential equation @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath48 is appropriately bounded and @xmath28 is sufficiently small , then , because the contraction rate to the attractor is exponentially fast , the attractor persists in the family   in analogy with the persistence of attractors in finite - dimensional dynamical systems ; in fact , each corresponding member of the family   has an @xmath33-dimensional attractor in the state space @xmath43 and the restriction of the dynamical system to this attractor is an ordinary differential equation .",

    "the bifurcation points ( corresponding to the existence of centers ) are given by @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a non - negative integer .",
    "these are the values of @xmath145 such that the characteristic equation has pure imaginary roots .",
    "a computation shows that if @xmath157 is even , then as @xmath145 increases a pair of pure imaginary roots crosses the imaginary axis into the right half - plane , and if @xmath157 is odd , then the roots cross into the left half - plane . under the assumption that the bifurcations are supercritical",
    ", a stable limit cycle appears after the bifurcation in the first case ; in the second case , a stable limit cycle disappears . for the parameter values used to obtain figure  [ fig:1 ] , the bifurcation values computed from equation   are ( approximately ) @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 for @xmath162 such that @xmath163 . at @xmath164",
    "a limit cycle appears , at @xmath165 the limit cycle disappears , and so on .",
    "thus , these bifurcations account for the appearance and disappearance of oscillations in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we note that a similar sequence of bifurcations occurs whenever @xmath150 . on the other hand , if @xmath166 ( for example if @xmath149 ) , then all bifurcation points correspond to roots of the characteristic equation crossing into the right half - plane . in this case",
    ", the bifurcations can be subcritical .",
    "indeed , for @xmath149 , numerical simulations indicate that no limit cycle appears . as a result ,",
    "solutions starting near the unstable rest point become unbounded .",
    "the slow dynamical system , obtained by reduction from a truncation of an expansion of a delay equation in powers of the delay , approximates the dynamics on the global attractor of the delay equation as long as the delay is sufficiently small ; but , as our examples show , the ordinary differential equations obtained by expansion , truncation , and reduction _ can not _ be used in general to predict the correct dynamical behavior for sufficiently large delays .",
    "we have mentioned , for example , that the dimension of the attractor of a family of delay equations , parametrized by the delay , can increase in dimension so that that the corresponding slow vector field is no longer defined on the attractor . but this is not the only possible scenario for the appearance of new attractor dynamics ; for example , the attractor could cease to exist or be a manifold for some values of the delay .",
    "the abraham - lorentz type equation   can be used , after reduction to a slow manifold , to predict the relative orbital motion of a relativistic binary system in the regime where the delay is sufficiently small .",
    "the size of the maximum allowed delay would have to be computed on a case - by - case basis using the explicit form of the delay equation that models the dynamics of a coalescing pair of neutron stars .",
    "the results of this section show that for sufficiently large delay the attractor does not in general correspond to the slow manifold .",
    "the question remains whether such a divergence of behaviors could ever occur in the case of retarded equations of classical field theory .",
    "this is an interesting open problem .",
    "it is expected that interferometric gravitational wave detectors that are presently under construction will be able to detect signals from massive coalescing binary systems . for the analysis of such forthcoming data , it is important to have theoretically predicted wave forms ( ` templates ' ) for the relevant astrophysical processes . to this end ,",
    "extensive computations are necessary that need to take gravitational radiation reaction into account  @xcite .",
    "the standard approach leads to higher time - derivative equations that involve runaway modes and inevitably produce incorrect results .",
    "we have determined the source of the difficulty by investigating delay equations , which are essentially nonlocal , and the higher time - derivative equations that are obtained by truncations of the ( post - newtonian ) expansions in powers of the delay . for sufficiently small delays ,",
    "a proper justification is provided for the usual method of replacing terms with higher - derivatives by terms with at most first derivatives using repeated substitution of the equations of motion ( ` iterative reduction ' ) .",
    "we have shown that in the investigation of the solutions of higher - derivative equations that represent phenomena involving radiation reaction , it is essential to reduce such equations to the corresponding slow manifolds before numerical analysis .",
    "our work suggests , however , that unexpected nonlocal phenomena could occur for sufficiently large delays that can not be predicted using the local equations of motion even after iterative reduction ."
