    "turbulent thermal convection is a problem of great research interest  ( see , for example ,  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "one interesting issue is to understand the scaling behavior of the velocity and temperature fluctuations .",
    "turbulent thermal convection is often investigated experimentally in rayleigh - bnard convection cells , which are closed cells of fluid heated from below and cooled on the top .",
    "such confined turbulent convective flows are highly inhomogeneous as thermal and viscous boundary layers are formed near the top and bottom of the cell . scaling laws for the central region of such confined turbulent thermal convection have been put forth and shown to be in good agreement with the existing experimental measurements  @xcite . on the other hand , shell models focussing on the energy cascade process",
    "have been studied intensively and proved to be useful for understanding the scaling behavior of velocity fluctuations in inertia - driven turbulence  ( see , for example ,  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is thus natural to also construct shell models for turbulent thermal convection .",
    "shell models are , by construction , boundary - free and thus shell models for turbulent thermal convection are necessarily models of _ homogeneous _ turbulent thermal convection . it is known that the presence of boundaries generates coherent structures such as plumes and a large - scale mean flow in confined turbulent thermal convection , and these coherent structures can affect the scaling behavior  @xcite .",
    "thus , scaling behavior in confined turbulent thermal convection and scaling behavior in homogeneous turbulent thermal convection as studied in shell models can be different .",
    "several shell models for turbulent thermal convection have been proposed and different scaling behavior reported . specifically , bolgiano - obukhov ( bo ) scaling  @xcite plus intermittency corrections has been reported in the shell model constructed by brandenburg  @xcite and also in the modified model by suzuki and toh  @xcite for some parameter range . on the other hand ,",
    "kolmogorov 1941 ( k41 ) scaling  @xcite plus intermittency corrections has been reported by jiang and liu  @xcite using a shell model extended from the gledzer - ohkitani - yamada ( goy ) model  @xcite , which we shall denote as the goyt model . in this paper",
    ", we show that buoyancy is not always significant and directly relevant to the statistical properties even though there is an explicit coupling between velocity and temperature in the equations of motion in all these shell models .",
    "we clarify that the two different types of scaling behavior reported correspond respectively to the case when buoyancy is relevant to the statistical properties and the case when it is not . specifically , the scaling behavior is bo plus intermittency corrections when buoyancy is relevant , and k41 plus intermittency corrections ( as one would expect for temperature behaving as a passive scalar ) when buoyancy is irrelevant .",
    "we show that the intermittency corrections of temperature could be solely attributed to fluctuations in the entropy transfer rate when buoyancy is relevant but due to fluctuations in both energy and entropy transfer rates when buoyancy is irrelevant .",
    "this difference might be used as a criterion to distinguish whether temperature is behaving as an active or a passive scalar .",
    "two classes of shell models have been proposed for studying turbulent thermal convection .",
    "the first class consists of the shell model proposed by brandenburg  @xcite and its modified versions  @xcite .",
    "the other class consists of the goyt model , the shell model extended from the goy model  @xcite and the sabrat model  @xcite from the sabra model  @xcite .",
    "the sabra model  @xcite was proposed to eliminate some undesirable periodic oscillations in the goy model , and have essentially the same scaling behavior as the goy model .",
    "the scaling behavior in the first class of shell models is bo plus corrections in some parameter range while the scaling behavior in the second class of shell models is always k41 plus corrections . in this paper",
    ", we focus on two shell models , one from each class . the first one , denoted as the brandenburg model , is the modified model proposed by suzuki and toh  @xcite without the drag term .",
    "the second is the sabrat model .",
    "the basic idea of a shell model is to consider variables in discrete  shells \" in fourier @xmath0-space , and construct a set of ordinary differential equations for these variables per shell . for shell models for turbulent thermal convection ,",
    "there are two variables , the velocity and temperature variables , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they can be roughly thought of as the fourier transforms of the velocity and temperature fields with wavevector @xmath3 , whose magnitude satisfies @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 is the wavenumber of the @xmath6th shell , with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the wavenumber corresponding to the largest scale in the system .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the forcing term acting only on the first few shells .",
    "the nonlinear terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 are taken to couple quadratically with the nearest shells and sometimes also the next nearest shells , and are constructed to satisfy two conservation laws of energy and entropy ( proportional to @xmath13 ) in the limit of @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath16   - \\alpha g\\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^n { re\\{u_n \\theta^ * _ n } \\ }   & = & 0   \\\\ { d \\over { dt}}\\left[{1 \\over 2}\\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^n { |\\theta _ n|^2 } \\right ] & = & 0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a result , the nonlinear terms @xmath17 and @xmath18 should have a fluxlike form such that the evolution equations of energy and entropy in the @xmath6th shell are : @xmath19   & = & f_u(k_n)-f_u(k_{n+1})- \\nu k^2 _",

    "consider eq .",

    "the third term of the right hand side is the rate of energy dissipation in the @xmath6th shell due to viscosity while the last term is the power injected into the @xmath6th shell by the buoyancy forces .",

    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , we find that eq .",
    "( [ buoyant ] ) is satisfied for most of the shells only in the brandenburg model with @xmath68 larger than the critical value .",
    "when @xmath68 is smaller than the critical value , buoyancy is insignificant in all except the largest shells .",

    "indeed we find bo scaling plus corrections when buoyancy is significant and k41 scaling plus correction when it is not .",
    "the two different scaling behavior can be understood by studying the evolution equations of energy and entropy . in the intermediate range where external forcing is not acting and where energy and entropy dissipation rates are both small , eqs .",

    "one expects the statistical properties to be controlled by the entropy cascade .",
    "specifically , one expects  @xcite the statistical properties of @xmath1 and @xmath2 to be determined solely by @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath103 : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are dimensionless random variables that are independent of @xmath103 and statistically independent of @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",

    "( [ rsh2u ] ) and ( [ rsh2theta ] ) indicate that the conditional statistics of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at fixed values of @xmath108 continue to deviate from simple k41 scaling .",

    "the results of @xmath118 do not depend on @xmath121 and are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that for brandenburg model with large @xmath68 , @xmath118 are indeed well described by the bo values of @xmath122 .",
    "also , as expected , for both the brandenburg model with small @xmath68 and the sabrat model , @xmath118 s continue to deviate from the k41 values of @xmath123 .",
    "various shell models have been proposed for turbulent thermal convection .",

    ", we have shown that buoyancy is not always significant and relevant to the statistical properties in these shell models even though there is an explicit coupling term with temperature in the equation of motion for velocity .",
    "we have further clarified that bo scaling plus corrections would be observed only in the shell models in which buoyancy is significant . for shell models in",
    "which buoyancy is insignificant , the statistical properties remain the same as in the case in which the coupling term with temperature is absent .",
    "we have argued that the statistics properties are controlled solely by the cascade of entropy when buoyancy is significant but controlled by both the cascades of energy and entropy when buoyancy is not significant , and shown how this leads to the two different scaling behavior in the two cases .",
    "we have further shown that the intermittency corrections are solely attributed to fluctuations of the entropy transfer rate when buoyancy is significant but are caused by fluctuations of both the energy and entropy transfer rate when buoyancy is insignificant . as a result , the conditional temperature structure functions at fixed entropy transfer rate would have simple scaling when buoyancy is significant but remain anomalous when buoyancy is insignificant .",
