    "there are several unique features in baryonic @xmath0 decays . first , a peak near the threshold area of the dibaryon invariant mass spectrum has been observed in many baryonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "second , three - body decays usually have rates larger than their two - body counterparts ; that is , @xmath20 .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in terms of the threshold effect , namely , the invariant mass of the dibaryon is preferred to be close to the threshold .",
    "the configuration of the two - body decay @xmath21 is not favorable since its invariant mass is @xmath22 . in @xmath23",
    "decays , the effective mass of the baryon pair is reduced as the emitted meson can carry away much energy .",
    "the low mass threshold effect can be understood in terms of a simple short - distance picture @xcite . for singly charmful baryonic",
    "@xmath0 decays , experimentally we have @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have a pattern like @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes a charmed baryon .    the experimental measurements for doubly charmful @xmath0 decays are summarized in table [ tab:2bodycharm ] . for @xmath28",
    "decays , we extract their branching ratios using @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , @xmath31 where the second errors originate from the uncertainties in @xmath32 ranging from 0.83% to 1.74% and @xmath33 from 1.2% to 10.1% @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is expected that the charged and neutral @xmath0 decays to @xmath34 should have similar rates .",

    "in this work we have studied the doubly charmful two - body and three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays @xmath39 and @xmath19 . for the former decay ,",
    "our prediction for its branching ratio of order @xmath17 ( see table [ tabc ] ) is consistent with the extrapolation from @xmath40 and from @xmath41 provided that the dynamical suppression of @xmath42 relative to @xmath6 is taken into account .",
    "as pointed out before , a naive estimate of the branching ratio @xmath3 for the decay @xmath19 is too small by three to four orders of magnitude compared to experiment .",
    "previously , it has been shown that a large enhancement for the @xmath4 production can occur due to a charmonium - like resonance ( for example , the @xmath5 state discovered by belle ) with a mass near the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "motivated by the babar s observation of a resonance in the @xmath43 system with a mass of order 2930 mev , we have studied the contribution to @xmath44 from the intermediate state @xmath9 which is postulated to be a first positive - parity excited @xmath10-wave charmed baryon state . assuming that a soft @xmath11 quark pair is produced through the @xmath12 and @xmath13 meson exchanges in the configuration for @xmath45 , it is found that the branching ratio of @xmath46 is of order @xmath16 .",
    "this is in agreement with experiment for @xmath47 , but slightly smaller for @xmath18 . in conjunction with the previous analysis @xcite",
    ", we conclude that the enormously large rate of @xmath19 arises from the resonances @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",

    "( we use a tilde to denote states with antisymmetric orbital wave functions ( i.e. @xmath60 ) under the interchange of two light quarks . )",
