    "in the past decades , searching for the mysterious particle , majorana fermion , proposed by ettore majorana in 1937 @xcite has continued to be an important issue in high - energy physics .",
    "recently , the field of topological superconductors and superfluids@xcite in condensed matter physics has been drawing much attention since these topological matters are capable of hosting majorana fermions . instead of seeking for it in high - energy experiments , topological matters in condensed matter systems may shed light on finding this elusive majorana fermion .",
    "majorana fermion , half state of a fermion , obeys non - abelian statistics and possesses the non - local property .",
    "both of the significant ingredients render such topological matters a great potential to realize quantum computers @xmath12 the dream which scientists have been pursuing for over 30 years .",
    "topological matters are classified by distinct topological numbers based on dimension and symmetries of the system . in analogous to the framework of topological insulators characterized by a @xmath13 invariance , non - centrosymmetric superconductors which break inversion symmetry but preserve time reversal symmetry are generally termed as time - reversal - invariant ( tri ) superconductors .",
    "inversion symmetry breaking leads to the mixing of spin - singlet and spin - triplet cooper pairings@xcite . as a result",
    ", intensive studies have been dedicated to investigate fully gapped tri superconductors for their potential to be a topological nontrivial matter , termed as tri topological superconductors@xcite . in order to have fully gapped superconductors , many proposals for creating majorana fermions rely on the proximity effect of @xmath14-wave superconductors@xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of these approaches lies in the fact that most @xmath14-wave superconductors have low critical temperatures and majorana fermions can be generated only in very low temperatures .",
    "it is therefore desirable to seek alternative approaches based on high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors .    in real materials , the heavy - fermion superconductor , @xmath15 @xcite",
    ", discovered in the early days and the recent finding of superconductivity at the interface between @xmath16 and @xmath17@xcite are typical examples of tri superconductors in which spin - orbit interaction comes into play due to lack of inversion center .",
    "recently , it is argued that the contact of heavy metals with superconductors can induce the rashba spin - orbit interaction in the interface@xcite . in particular , for au / ybco interface , it is estimated that the rashba spin splitting energy at fermi surface is of the order 200 mev@xcite .",
    "there is also experimental evidence showing that there may exist intrinsic spin - orbit interaction in cuprate superconductors@xcite . from theoretical point of view , however , the strength of available spin orbit interaction is too small to turn a @xmath3-wave cuprate superconductor into a fully gapped tri superconductor",
    ". therefore , even though the ideal scheme is to generate majarona fermions via tri topological superconductors , its feasibility is low in high @xmath0 cuprates and it is necessary to seek for alternative approaches .    in this paper , we investigate effects of the rashba spin - orbit interaction on high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors .",
    "based on the mean - field theory of _ t - j model@xcite , we show that the gap function @xmath3-vector for the induced spin - triplet pairing is generally not aligned with the internal magnetic field of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this fact respects the @xmath18 point group symmetry and for typical strength of the rashba interaction , the superconductor is still gapless with each nodal point of the original @xmath3-wave superconducting state being split .",
    "the resulting nodal points are protected by symmetries in the symmetry class diii@xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the splitting nodal structures , zero - energy majorana edge modes that are determined by projection of bulk nodes to edges@xcite always exist for any orientations of interfaces that are not exactly in @xmath19 $ ] or @xmath20 $ ] directions .",
    "in particular , near @xmath21 $ ] direction in which @xmath3-wave is subdominant to @xmath2-wave , there exist sizable dispersive majorana edge states .",
    "our results indicate that the presence of these majorana modes gives rises to a small plateau in tunneling spectrum near zero bias peak .",
    "furthermore , these majorana modes always result in 4@xmath7-josephson effect in typical junctions and hence flux trapped in tricrystal experiments jump in unit of two flux quanta .",

    "@xmath215 is fixed to be @xmath422 and the energy for the quasi - particle of @xmath254 is chosen at the nodal point with the fourier wavevector @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath423 is the minimum energy of quasi - particles in s@xmath8 with fixed @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath423 generally does not vanish except when s and s@xmath8 are the same or @xmath424 .",
    "( b ) comparison of the enegy - phase relation due to quasi - particles ( solid circle ) and majorana modes ( open circle ) localized at the sis@xmath8 junction .",
    "the josephson current due to quasi - particles is heavily suppressed.,width=302 ]      in this subsection , we examine stability of @xmath348 periodicity and effects due to energy dispersion along @xmath23 axis . specifically , we examine whether the @xmath348 periodicity is spoiled by the presence of quasi - particles .",
    "we first note that the @xmath248 periodicity relies on the conservation of fermion pairty . in the presence of quasi - particles ,",
    "the fermion parity is no longer conserved@xcite .",
    "however , if the energies of quasi - particles are gapped , the fermion parity is approximately conserved at low temperatures@xcite . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the bulk superconducting states in realistic parameter regime are gapless .",
    "however , the sis@xmath8 junction involves the coupling of the superconducting states in two different orientations .",
    "when two superconducting states couple , since the fourier wavevector @xmath174 that is parallel to the junction is conserved , only quasi - particles with the same @xmath174 couple . due to different orientations of s and s@xmath8",
    "relative to the junction , @xmath174 of nodal points for s and s@xmath8 are not the same . as a result , quasi - particles at nodal points of s ( or s@xmath8 ) couple to quasi - particles at finite energies of s@xmath8 ( or s ) .",
    "hence the resulting quasi - particles residing near the junction are gapful and there is an energy gap , @xmath423 , associated with each orientation of the tunneling junction . in fig.[fig16]a , we examine @xmath423 versus @xmath364 by fixing @xmath426 . here",
    "the energy of the quasi - particle for s side is chosen at the nodal point with the fourier wavevector @xmath174 and @xmath423 is defined to be the minimum energy of quasi - particles in s@xmath8 with fixed @xmath174 .",
    "it is seen that except for special orientations when s and s@xmath8 are the same or @xmath424 , @xmath423 generally does not vanish .",
    "the parity conservation thus holds for quite general orientations of s and s@xmath8 .",
    "in addition to the protection of the pairty conservation , the momentum mismatch also suppresses the quasi - particle contribution .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig16]b .",
    "it is seen that @xmath427 for the contribution of quasi - particles is much more flat in comparison to that due to majorana modes .",
    "hence the josephson current ( @xmath428 ) due to quasi - particles is heavily suppressed and leads to little effects .",
    "finally , we discuss effects of the energy dispersion ( @xmath425 ) along @xmath23-axis .",
    "it is generally accepted that high-@xmath0 cuprates are approximately two dimensional with weak dispersion along @xmath23-axis .",
    "therefore , results derived in the above are approximately correct . for high-@xmath0 cuprates with one cuo@xmath429 per unit cell",
    ", the energy dispersion along @xmath23-axis can be approximated by@xcite @xmath430 with @xmath431 .",
    "following the discussion on eq.([spectra ] ) , for a given @xmath425 , nodal points are determined by @xmath432 . in other words , @xmath433 changes the fermi surface . for realistic parameters , @xmath434 , nodal points are along axes @xmath163 on which @xmath435 is satisfied .",
    "hence nodal points have no @xmath425 dispersion .",
    "therefore , all results based on projection of nodal points ( including @xmath248 periodicity ) are the same except that there are more majorana edge modes due to the @xmath425 dispersion . on the other hand , for @xmath436 , the @xmath425 dispersion changes the fermi energy by 10% for a give @xmath425 . as a result , there is no qualitative change on the dispersive majorana modes except for the corresponding 1% change of the range for the existence of the dispersive majorana modes .",
    "in conclusion , we have explored effects of the rashba spin - orbit interaction on the tunneling spectroscopy of high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors . the mean - field phase diagram in the large - u limit of hubbard model",
    "is established .",
    "it is shown that due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya and spin dipole - dipole interactions induced by the spin - orbit interaction , the majority regime in the phase diagram is gapless with pairing symmetry of superconductivity being @xmath437-wave .",
    "furthermore , the gap function @xmath3-vector for @xmath2-wave superconductivity is not aligned with the internal magnetic field of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "as the spin - orbit interaction is turned on , we find that the ground state undergoes a phase transition to a topological gapless phase with each nodal point originated from pure @xmath3-wave being split into two stable nodal points characterized by the symmetry class diii . due to the splitting nodal structure",
    ", zero - energy majorana modes always exist for any interfaces that are not exactly in @xmath4 or @xmath5 directions .",
    "in addition , due to non - aligned @xmath3-vector , as the @xmath2-wave amplitude further increases beyond the rashba spin - orbit interaction , a transition of nodal point configuration occurs .",
    "the ground state is still gapless .",
    "however , the majorana flat band near @xmath180 in @xmath6 edge becomes the dispersive majorana edge modes .",
    "in addition to the mean - field phase diagram , the tunneling conductances for the nis and sis@xmath8 junctions are also computed .",
    "our results indicate that due to the presence of dispersive majorana modes , a small plateau with shoulders near the zero bias peak would be induced in the tunneling spectrum .",
    "this small plateau with shoulders is a result due to the dirac cone of dispersive majorana modes at the edge .",
    "the appearance of the dirac cone at @xmath180 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] is a manifestation of @xmath2-wave order parameter and results from competition between the @xmath3-wave and @xmath2-wave pairing symmetries .",
    "when the @xmath3-wave dominates for @xmath438 , there are only flat bands at the edge , exhibiting a single zbcp in the tunneling spectrum . only when @xmath439 , the dirac cone near @xmath180 emerges and results in the additional feature that exhibits the feature of a small plateau with shoulders .",
    "the existence of the dirac cone at the edge requires particular symmetries .",
    "general perturbations such as disorders do not respect these symmetries and would not yield the feature of a small plateau with shoulders in the tunneling spectrum@xcite .",
    "hence the corresponding feature can not be generated by disorders .",
    "the feature of a zero - bias conductance peak sitting on a small plateau with shoulders has been frequently observed in tunneling spectrum of @xmath6 edge during the past@xcite .",
    "even though these evidences may not be the unique signature to conclude the existence of dispersive majorana fermions and further evidence from other measurements is in order , they show supportive evidence for dispersive majorana modes and indicate the importance of the spin - orbit interaction in high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "in addition , we find that the overlap of dispersionless majorana flat - bands in a josephson junction always results in 4@xmath7-periodicity in josephson effect .",
    "in particular , for typical configurations of @xmath7-ring in tricrystal experiments that can trap a half - flux vortex , we find that as long as the difference of the orientations for @xmath27 axes of two crystals involved in a junction is within @xmath9 , the junction always exhibit 4@xmath7-periodicity in josephson effect . for typical configurations of tricrystal experiments , one has @xmath440 , @xmath441 , and @xmath442@xcite . the edge of crystal b in facing a is along @xmath5 direction .",
    "if the orientation of interfaces is perfect , since there is no edge state in @xmath5 edge , one expects that there is no majorana fermion trapped in the @xmath7-ring .",
    "however , in real experiments , there may exist deviations in orientations of edges .",
    "any deviation of the edge for crystal b from the @xmath5 direction would satisfy eq.([tricrystal ] ) .",
    "this would result in trapped majorana fermions between a and b so that the trapped flux in the @xmath7-ring jumps in unit of two flux quanta in externally applied magnetic fields . this would be consistent with the experimental observation that @xmath443-flux quanta has not been observed in tricrystal experiments@xcite .",
    "therefore , the above analyses indicate that majorana fermions may have been already observed in tunneling experiments on high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "while so far in this work we only consider results based on the mean - field theory , we expect our results are robust in the presence of correlation effects as long as the symmetry of the system is not changed .",
    "even though our results show agreement with past experimental observations , definite confirmation of majorana fermions in high-@xmath0 cuprates requires further experimental studies .",
    "nonetheless , our results offer important signatures to look for in future experiments . in particular ,",
    "the setup configuration for tricrystal experiments would offer a unique way to hold majorana fermions in high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "all the signatures we find are crucial for successfully searching majorana fermions and are left for future experimental confirmations .",
