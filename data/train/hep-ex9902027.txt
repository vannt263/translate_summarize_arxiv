    "this report has been given at the request of the organizers of the delphi symposium .",
    "it summarizes the most exciting news on neutrino oscillations and neutrino masses , as they were presented at the neutrino 98 conference ( @xmath098 ) at takayama ( japan ) in june 1998 , at the ringberg euroconference ( new trends in neutrino physics ) in may 1998 , and in various recent publications .",
    "one of the fundamental questions in particle physics is as to whether neutrinos have a mass ( @xmath1 , massive neutrinos ) or are exactly massless ( like the photon ) . for the following reason this question is directly related to the more general problem whether there is new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) : in the minimal sm neutrinos have a fixed helicity , always @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this implies @xmath4 , since only massless particles can be eigenstates of the helicity operator .",
    "@xmath1 would therefore transcend the simple sm .",
    "direct kinematic measurements of neutrino masses have so far yielded only rather loose upper limits , the present best values being @xcite : @xmath5 these limits will very likely not be improved considerably in the future .",
    "access to much smaller mass values is provided by neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "they allow , however , to measure only differences of masses squared , @xmath6 , rather than masses directly . for completeness",
    "we summarize briefly the most relevant formulae for neutrino oscillations in the vacuum , considering for simplicity only two neutrino flavours @xmath7 , e.g.  @xmath8 ( two - flavour formalism ) .",
    "the generalisation to three or more flavours is straight - forward in principle , but somewhat more involved in practice @xcite .",
    "the two flavour eigenstates @xmath9 are in general related to the two mass eigenstates @xmath10 with masses @xmath11 by a unitary transformation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mixing angle .",
    "if @xmath14 , the two eigenstates @xmath10 evolve differently in time , so that for @xmath15 a given original linear superposition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 changes with time into a different superposition .",
    "this means that flavour transitions ( oscillations ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 can occur with certain time - dependent oscillatory probabilities . in other words ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : if a neutrino is produced ( or detected ) at a as a flavour eigenstate @xmath20 ( e.g.  @xmath21 from @xmath22 ) , it is detected , after travelling a distance ( baseline ) @xmath23 , at b with a probability @xmath24 as flavour eigenstate @xmath25 ( e.g.  @xmath26 in @xmath27 ) . the probability @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 & = \\sin^2 2\\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\left ( 1.267   { \\displaystyle\\frac{\\delta m^2 } { { \\rm ev}^2 } \\cdot \\frac{l/{\\rm m}}{e/{\\rm mev}}}\\right ) \\end{array}\\right\\rbrace \\begin{array}{l } { \\rm for}\\ \\nu_a \\neq \\nu_b\\\\ ( { \\rm flavour~change}\\\\ \\nu_a \\to \\nu_b ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 neutrino energy .",
    "thus the probability oscillates when varying @xmath33 , with @xmath13 determining the amplitude @xmath34 and @xmath35 the frequency of the oscillation .",
    "the smaller @xmath35 , the larger @xmath33 values are needed to see oscillations , i.e.  significant deviations of @xmath36 from zero and of @xmath37 from unity . notice the two necessary conditions for @xmath0 oscillations : ( a ) @xmath14 implying that not all neutrinos are massless , and ( b ) non - conservation of the lepton - flavour numbers .",
    "the masses @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the flavour eigenstates are expectation values of the mass operator , i.e.  linear combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 m ( \\nu_b ) = \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot m_1 + \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot m_2 \\end{array}\\ ] ] for a small mixing angle : @xmath43 , @xmath44 . for maximum mixing ( @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 .",
    "the most exciting new results presented at @xmath098 come from super - kamiokande on atmospheric neutrinos ; they show convincing evidence for neutrino oscillations and thus for massive neutrinos .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are created when a high - energy cosmic - ray proton ( or nucleus ) from outer space collides with a nucleus in the earth s atmosphere , leading to an extensive air shower ( eas ) by cascades of secondary interactions .",
    "such a shower contains many @xmath47 ( and @xmath48 ) mesons ( part of ) which decay according to @xmath49{0.4pt}{1ex}\\hspace*{-4pt}\\rightarrow}e^+ \\nu_e \\overline{\\nu}_\\mu & & { \\;\\rule[0.5ex]{0.4pt}{1ex}\\hspace*{-4pt}\\rightarrow}e^- \\overline{\\nu}_e \\nu_\\mu \\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] yielding atmospheric neutrinos . from ( [ e5 ] ) one would expect in an underground neutrino detector a number ratio of @xmath50 if all @xmath51 decayed before reaching the detector .",
    "this is the case only at rather low shower energies whereas with increasing energy more and more @xmath51 survive due to relativistic time dilation ( atmospheric @xmath52 ) . consequently the expected @xmath53 ratio rises above 2 ( fewer and fewer @xmath54 ) with increasing @xmath0 energy . for quantitative predictions",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , which include also other ( small ) @xmath0 sources , have been performed modelling the air showers in detail and yielding the fluxes of the various neutrino species ( @xmath55 ) as a function of the @xmath0 energy @xcite .",
    "the various calculations agree on the absolute @xmath0 fluxes only within @xmath56 whereas the agreement on the flux ratio @xmath53 is much better , namely within @xmath57 .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos reaching the underground super - kamiokande detector can be registered by neutrino reactions inside the detector , the simplest and most frequent reactions being cc quasi - elastic scatterings : @xmath58    super - kamiokande ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) @xcite is a big water - cherenkov detector in the kamioka mine ( japan ) at a depth of @xmath59 1000 m. it consists of 50 ktons ( 50000 m@xmath60 ) of ultrapurified water in a cylindrical tank ( diameter = 39 m , height = 41 m ) .",
    "the inner detector volume of 32 ktons is watched by 11146 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts , diameter = 20@xmath61 ) mounted on the volume s surface and providing a 40% surface coverage . the outer detector , which vetos entering particles and tags exiting particles , is a 2.5 m thick water layer surrounding the inner volume and looked at by 1885 smaller pmts ( diameter = 8@xmath61 ) . a high - velocity charged particle passing through the water produces a cone of cherenkov light which is registered by the pmts . the cherenkov image of a particle starting and ending inside the inner detector is a ring , the image of a particle starting inside and leaving the inner detector is a disk .",
    "a distinction between an @xmath62-like event ( [ e7]a ) and a @xmath52-like event ( [ e7]b ) is possible ( with an efficiency of @xmath63 ) from the appearance of the   has an image with a diffuse , fuzzy boundary whereas the boundary of a @xmath51 image is sharp .",
    "the observed numbers of @xmath52-like and @xmath62-like events give directly the observed ratio @xmath64 which is to be compared with the mc - predicted ratio @xmath65 ( for no @xmath0 oscillations ) by computing the double ratio @xmath66 agreement between observation and expectation implies @xmath67 .",
    "the events are separated into fully contained events ( fc , no track leaving the inner volume ) and partially contained events ( pc , one or more tracks leaving the inner volume ) . for fc events the visible energy @xmath68 , which is obtained from the pulse heights in the pmts ,",
    "is close to the @xmath0 energy . with this in mind",
    ", the fc sample is subdivided into sub - gev events ( @xmath69 gev ) and multi - gev events ( @xmath70 gev ) . in the multi - gev range",
    "the @xmath0 direction is determined as the direction of the cherenkov - light cone , since at higher energies the directions of the incoming @xmath0 and the outgoing charged lepton are close to each other .",
    "the double ratio @xmath71 has been measured previously by kamiokande , the smaller predecessor of super - kamiokande with 3.0 ktons of water , yielding @xcite @xmath72   = 0.57 \\pm { 0.08 \\atop 0.07}\\ { \\rm ( stat.)}\\ \\pm 0.07\\ { \\rm ( syst . ) } & \\mbox{from 233 multi - gev events . }",

    "@xmath71 is significantly smaller than unity ( atmospheric @xmath0 anomaly ) which is due , as it turns out ( see below ) , to a deficit of @xmath74 and not to an excess of @xmath54 in @xmath64 .",
    "a natural explanation of this deficit is that some @xmath74 have oscillated into @xmath75 or @xmath76 according to ( [ e3 ] ) before reaching the detector .",
    "however , the solution @xmath77 of kamiokande ( not of super - kamiokande ) is ruled out by the chooz experiment ( see below ) so that probably only @xmath78 remains .",
    "this explanation has been evidenced by a study of the @xmath0 fluxes and of @xmath71 as a function of the zenith angle @xmath79 between the vertical ( zenith ) and the @xmath0 direction .",
    "a @xmath0 with @xmath80 comes from above ( down - going @xmath0 ) after travelling a distance of @xmath81 km ( effective thickness of the atmosphere ) ; a @xmath0 with @xmath82 reaches the detector from below ( up - going @xmath0 ) after traversing the whole earth with @xmath83 km .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows for multi - gev events ( for which the @xmath0 direction can be determined ) the dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath84 as measured by kamiokande @xcite .",
    "up-@xmath21 are seen to be missing ( @xmath85 ) whereas down-@xmath21 appear in the expected frequency @xmath86 ) . in terms of @xmath0 oscillations",
    "this means that part of the up-@xmath21 have changed their flavour on their long way through the earth whereas for down-@xmath21 @xmath23 is so small that @xmath87 , eq .  ( [ e3 ] ) , is practically zero .",
    "the @xmath21 deficit in fig .  [ fig3 ] is the larger , the larger @xmath79 and thereby @xmath23 is .",
    "a quantitative oscillation analysis yielded as the best - fit parameters @xcite @xmath88 the fit ( dotted histogram in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) describes the data points rather well .",
    "super - kamiokande @xcite has measured the @xmath89 dependence not only of @xmath71 , but also of the @xmath26 and @xmath21 fluxes separately : fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the @xmath89 distributions ( crosses ) of ( a ) fc @xmath62-like and ( b ) fc @xmath52-like + pc events in the multi - gev range .",
    "( the pc events turned out to be practically all @xmath21 events ) .",
    "the rectangles show the mc predictions for no oscillations . an up - down asymmetry is defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of events with @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . for no oscillations ,",
    "@xmath94 is expected for @xmath95 gev , independently of the mc model . from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the following experimental values were obtained @xcite : @xmath96 whereas there is no asymmetry for @xmath26 , @xmath97 being compatible with zero , a clear asymmetry with a @xmath98 significance is observed for @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , whereas for @xmath62-like events the data agree reasonably well with the mc prediction , for @xmath52-like events a deficit is found at larger @xmath79 .",
    "no explanation other than @xmath0 oscillations could be found for this deficit .",
    "an oscillation analysis yielded a much better fit for @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) than for @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath103 to be compared with ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows in the @xmath104 plane the allowed regions from kamiokande ( 90% cl ) and from super - kamiokande ( 68 , 90 , 99% cl ) .",
    "the kamiokande and super - kamiokande 90% cl regions have only a small overlap around @xmath105 ev@xmath106 . with this @xmath35 value , the distance @xmath107 for a full oscillation ( oscillation length @xmath108 ) is @xmath109 km according to eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) for @xmath110 gev .    in conclusion :",
    "evidence has been found by kamiokande and more significantly by super - kamiokande for @xmath0 oscillations @xmath99 with @xmath111 ev@xmath106 and maximal mixing .",
    "for a hierarchical mass scenario @xmath112 this implies more generally , this value can be regarded as a lower limit of @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "for completeness we mention two experiments , kamiokande@xcite and macro @xcite , that have recently measured up - going ( @xmath115 ) muons which pass through the detector from outside . owing to their large zenith angle",
    "@xmath79 they can not be atmospheric muons  those would not range so far into the earth  , but are rather produced in cc reactions by energetic ( @xmath116 gev ) up - going @xmath117 in the rock surrounding the detector . in both experiments a deficit ,",
    "although not very significant because of large errors , is observed in the flux of upward through - going muons as compared to the theoretical expectation : @xmath118 from kamiokande and @xmath119 from macro ; the errors are mainly due to the relatively large theoretical flux uncertainty . using the zenith angular distribution of the upward through - going muons for an oscillation analysis , kamiokande obtains the following best - fit parameters in the physical region ( to be compared with the values ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e13 ] ) ) : @xmath120 however",
    ", the 90% cl allowed region in the ( @xmath121 ) plane ( not shown ) is much larger than the allowed kamiokande region in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which shows that the through - going muon data are much less restrictive than the data with @xmath0 interactions taking place in the detector .",
    "similarly , macro obtains an allowed region around the values @xmath122",
    "solar neutrinos come from the fusion reaction @xmath123 inside the sun with a total energy release of 26.7 mev after two @xmath124 annihilations .",
    "the @xmath0 energy spectrum extends up to about 15 mev with an average of @xmath125 mev .",

    "[ tab2 ] it seems evident that there are three independent @xmath128 values .",
    "this requires a minimum of four different @xmath0 species since for three @xmath0 flavours the three possible @xmath128 are not independent : @xmath129 .",
    "the fourth @xmath0 must be a sterile ( inactive ) neutrino ( @xmath130 ) , which does not participate in the weak interaction ( e.g.  a right - handed @xmath0 ) , since from the lep experiments the number of light active neutrinos , coupling to @xmath131 , is known to be 3 an alternative , leaving it at three @xmath0 species , is of course that one of the measurements in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] is wrong .",
    "we now discuss , step by step , some possible mass assignments in a qualitative way ( fig .",
