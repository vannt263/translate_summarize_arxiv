    "since the fluctuations in @xmath138 itself are small , the resulting average is an unbiased estimate of the microcanonical susceptibility at the ( canonical ) average energy associated with that temperature .",
    "for the canonical susceptibility , we use ( [ equ : def_chi4 ] ) , with canonical averages throughout , including @xmath141 we estimate canonical averages by averaging over the data from the eight energies that are representative of the relevant temperature .",
    "the canonical and microcanonical susceptibilities satisfy @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the specific heat per particle at constant volume .",
    "the behavior of @xmath143 that we have computed for the wca mixture is unremarkable .",
    "it rises slowly with lowering temperature , indicative of mean - square potential energy and kinetic energy fluctuations that are virtually independent of temperature over the lowest temperatures we have considered .",
    "we show results for both susceptibilities in figure  [ fig : wca_ens ] , together with an estimate of @xmath144 .",
    "[ in evaluating @xmath144 , the derivative and specific heat are evaluated by a finite difference analysis of the temperature dependence of the the mean energy and @xmath73 ] .",
    "the data is at the low temperature @xmath111 . at large @xmath9",
    ", @xmath139 is not saturated by the difference term @xmath144 .",
    "instead the microcanonical contribution is larger .",
    "however , at smaller @xmath9 , the difference term exceeds the microcanonical part for times near the peak . just as in the ( 2)-tlg",
    ", the difference term becomes more significant at smaller @xmath9 , and at later times .",
    "since the size of the difference term reflects coupling between energy fluctuations and dynamics , it would appear that motion over large distances couples strongly to the local value of the energy while local rearrangements do not .",
    "very recently , szamel and flenner @xcite measured the contribution of global energy fluctuations to the canonical susceptibility @xmath146 , in a model glass - former with brownian dynamics ( here , @xmath147 is the potential energy contribution to the heat capacity , at constant volume ) .",
    "since brownian dynamics are non - conservative , @xmath148 does not represent a bound on the canonical @xmath8 .",
    "however , the results of @xcite show that while @xmath148 and the unconstrained susceptibility are not equal , they are of the same order of magnitude for large @xmath9 . we find a similar situation in the ( 2)-tlg ; in the wca mixture then the difference term @xmath144 is much smaller than the canonical susceptibility at these wave vectors .                    in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , only the fluctuations of the real part of @xmath149 were considered .",
    "we prefer to consider the full phase factor since both real and imaginary parts contribute to the fourier transform of the density ; both parts contribute to our @xmath8 .",
    "numerical contributions of the two components of of @xmath8 are similar , except when either of @xmath9 or @xmath4 is very large or very small ."
