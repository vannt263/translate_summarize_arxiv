    "two independent methods are used to identify strongly interacting galaxies : a tailored visual classification system complemented with spectrophotometric redshifts and stellar masses , as well as the cas merger criterion ( @xmath11  0.35 and @xmath12 ; conselice 2003 ) , based on cas asymmetry @xmath13 and clumpiness @xmath14 parameters .",
    "this allows one of the most extensive comparisons to date between cas - based and visual classification results .",

    "the corresponding lower limit on the minor ( 1/10 @xmath19 1/4 ) merger fraction ranges from 3.6% to 7.5% .",
    "this is the first , albeit approximate , empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers over the last 7 gyr . *    * ( 2 ) for an assumed value of @xmath6  0.5 gyr for the visibility timescale , it follows that _ each massive ( @xmath7  @xmath20 @xmath9 ) galaxy has undergone @xmath6  0.7 mergers of mass ratio  @xmath21  1/10 over the redshift interval @xmath18  0.240.80 .",

    ", such extensive comparisons have not been attempted to date , and are long overdue .",
    "_ we find qualitative agreement between the observations and models , with the ( major+minor ) merger rate from different models bracketing the observed rate , and showing a factor of five dispersion _",
    "one can now anticipate that in the near future , improvements in both the observational estimates and model predictions will start to rule out certain merger scenarios and refine our understanding of the merger history of galaxies . *    * ( 4 ) the idea that galaxy interactions generally enhance the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies is well established from observations ( e.g. , joseph & wright 1985 ; kennicutt et al . 1987 ) and simulations ( e.g. , hernquist 1989 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005b ) .",
    "however , simulations can not uniquely predict the factor by which interaction enhance the sf activity of galaxies over the last 7 gyr , since both the sfr and properties of the remnants in simulations are highly sensitive to the stellar feedback model , the bulge - to - disk ( @xmath27 ) ratio , the gas mass fractions , and orbital geometry ( e.g. , cox et al 2006 ; di matteo et al .",

    "in @xmath0cdm models of galaxy evolution , there are in principle three main mechanisms to build bulges of spiral galaxies : major mergers , minor mergers , and secular processes ( see wjkbk08 for details ) .",
    "the major merger of two spiral galaxies destroys the disk component and leaves behind a classical bulge , around which a stellar disk forms when hot gas in the halo subsequently cools , settles into a disk , and forms stars .",
    "minor mergers can also grow bulges in several ways .",
    "a tidally induced bar and/or direct tidal torques from the companion can drive gas into the inner kpc ( e.g. , quinn et al .",
    "1993 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ; jogee 2006 and references therein ) , where subsequent sf forms a compact high @xmath30 stellar component , or disky pseudobulge .",
    "in addition , the stellar core of the satellite can sink to the central region via dynamical friction .",
    "finally , bulges can also have a secular origin : here , a stellar bar or globally oval structure in a _ non - interacting _ galaxy drives gas inflow into the inner kpc , where subsequent sf forms a disky pseudobulge ( e.g. , kormendy 1993 ; jogee 1999 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; jogee , scoville , & kenney 2005 ) .",
    "these different mechanisms to form bulges have been postulated for a long time .",
    "however , what is still missing is a quantitative assessment of the relative importance of different bulge formation pathways in high and low mass spirals .",
    "for instance , although bulges are an integral part of massive present - day spiral galaxies , we still can not answer the following basic question : do most bulges in massive spirals form via major mergers , minor mergers , or secular processes ?",
    "another thorny issue is the prevalence of bulgeless galaxies .",
    "there is rising evidence that bulgeless galaxies are quite common in the local universe ( e.g. , bker et al .",
    "2002 ; kautsch et al .",
    "2006 ; bjm08a ; kormendy & fisher 2008 ) . yet , in @xmath0cdm models of galaxy evolution , most galaxies that had a past major merger at a time when their mass was a fairly large fraction of their present - day mass , are expected to have a significant bulge .",
    "so far , no quantitative comparisons have been done between observations and model predictions to assess how serious is the challenge posed by bulgeless galaxies .    in wjkbk08 , we attempt one of the first quantitative comparisons of the properties of bulges in a fairly complete sample of high mass ( @xmath31 ) spirals to predictions from @xmath0cdm - based simulations of galaxy evolution .",
    "we derive the bulge - to - total mass ratio ( @xmath32 ) and bulge srsic index @xmath33 by performing @xmath34 bulge - disk - bar decomposition on @xmath35-band images of 146 bright , high mass , moderately inclined spirals .    *",
    "( 1 ) interestingly , we find that as many as @xmath6  56% of high mass spirals have low @xmath36 bulges : such bulges exist in barred and unbarred galaxies across all hubble types ( fig .",

    "3a and 3b ) .",
    "*    * ( 2 ) we compare the observed distribution of bulge @xmath32 in high mass spirals to predictions from @xmath0cdm - based semi - analytical models . in the models , a bulge with @xmath37  0.2 can exist in a galaxy with a past major merger , only if the last major merger occurred at @xmath38 ( lookback @xmath21  10 gyr ) .",
    "the predicted fraction of high mass spirals with a past major merger and a bulge with a present - day @xmath39 is _ a factor of over fifteen smaller _ than the observed fraction ( @xmath6  66% ) of high mass spirals with @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "the comparisons _ rule out major mergers as the main formation pathway for bulges in high mass spirals_. contrary to common perception , _ bulges built via major mergers seriously fail to account for the bulges present in @xmath6  66% of high mass spirals_. *    * ( 3 ) in the models , the majority of low @xmath37  0.2 bulges exist in systems that have experienced _ only minor mergers , and no major mergers _ ( fig .",
    "these bulges can be built via minor mergers and secular processes .",
    "so far , we explored one realization of the model focusing on bulges built via satellite stars in minor mergers and find good agreement with the observations .",
