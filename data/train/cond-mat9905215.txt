    "renormalization - group ( rg ) theory @xcite has drastically improved our perspective about phase transition . when it is combined with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations",
    ", it becomes a very powerful tool to investigate critical phenomena .",
    "however , the so - called monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) method @xcite requires an elaborate scheme and experience , and application has been restricted to simple models such as the ising ferromagnet up to now . in this paper",
    "we reformulate the mcrg method and present a simple way to obtain the rg flow diagram in a mc simulation , which can provide essential information about critical phenomena .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , problems in the conventional mcrg scheme are explained and remedies for each problem are presented .",
    "in fact , modification of the conventional scheme leads to use of binder s parameter @xcite and the second parameter , which is used in recent high - precision numerical analyses @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , expected behavior of rg flow in the @xmath2 lattice @xmath1 model is presented for comparison with the mc result . some caution on mc simulation just at the upper critical dimension",
    "is also presented . in sec .",
    "iv , details of the mc simulation of the lattice @xmath1 model are described . in sec .",
    "v and vi , results of the mc simulation for @xmath0 are presented . in sec .",
    "vii , we summarize the result and discuss possible applications of the method to more complicated models .",
    "in the conventional mcrg scheme @xcite , critical exponents are calculated from eigenvalues of the linearized rg transformation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes coupling strength of the @xmath5th term of a block - spin hamiltonian with block size @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denotes the original size of the system .",
    "one problem is that one should use the proper definition of block spin , otherwise @xmath4 goes to zero or infinity as @xmath6 becomes large even at the critical point . for the ising model ,",
    "the majority rule is one of the options .",
    "however , it can not be extended to more complicated models .",
    "there are infinite kinds of definitions and location of the fixed point ( along an irrelevant direction ) depends on it @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use one that seems most simple and suitable for monte carlo simulation , |s_b s_b/ , [ sbar ] where @xmath8 denotes summation of all spins in the block .",
    "this definition is implicitly used in the definition of binder s parameter . actually , we use coarse - grained spin obtained by cutting high - momentum modes off , as in ref.@xcite . however , we set @xmath9 at the last stage , therefore real - space rg and momentum - space rg do not make much difference .",
    "another problem is that the block size @xmath6 should be much smaller than @xmath7 , otherwise the behavior of the block spin is affected by a boundary condition that is nonuniversal .",
    "thus one faces a tradeoff that for larger @xmath6 , behavior of block spins become more asymptotic ( couplings of irrelevant terms become smaller ) but their behavior deviates from bulk one .",
    "the solution is to use the following matrix = k_i(b l , b l ) k_j(b l , b ) , [ rgm2 ] instead of ( [ rgm1 ] ) . at the critical point ,",
    "= k_i(l , l ) k_j(l,1 ) should be satisfied and eigenvalues of the matrix ( [ rgm2 ] ) coincide with that of ( [ rgm1 ] ) .",
    "thus one can use as large a block size as the system size .    yet",
    "another , and most severe problem , is referred to as the `` redundancy problem '' @xcite . in the conventional mcrg scheme",
    ", one should observe very large numbers of block - spin interaction terms to construct a fixed - point hamiltonian .",
    "however , in the continuum @xmath1 theory , there are only two kinds of independent coupling constants ( mass and coupling ) .",
    "the lattice hamiltonian approaches this continuum asymptotically after the momentum - space rg transformation , and the two terms are enough to observe essential rg flow .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian defined on @xmath10-dimensional continuum space : = d. [ hcont ] note that it is not a microscopic hamiltonian : it is a phenomenological hamiltonian and the parameters @xmath11 should be determined to reproduce experimental results . in other words",
    ", it is the logarithm of probability of observing a specific configuration of some physical quantity @xmath12 in the experiment .",
    "this means that short length scale fluctuations beneath the resolution @xmath13 of the observation device are already integrated out and absorbed into the parameters @xmath11 .",
    "thus parameters depend on the cutoff length @xmath13 and should be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "we also denote the physical quantity @xmath12 averaged over a volume of linear length @xmath13 by @xmath15 .",
    "we replace the parameters in ( [ hcont ] ) by `` regularized '' ones defined as follows :    @xmath16 in terms of this regularization , the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "all possible values of the regularized parameter fall on a two - dimensional manifold on which @xmath19 is satisfied .",
    "this regularization is suitable for mc simulations , compared to the field theoretical one , @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ rgf3 ] and fig.[rgf4 ] show schematic rg flow of these regularized parameters in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively : high temperature , low temperature , gaussian , and wilson - fisher fixed point are denoted by h , l , g , and wf , respectively .",
    "now let us return to the lattice model defined as follows : h_l = 2_<ij > ( s_i - s_j)^2 + _ i 2s_i^2 + s_i^4 .",
    "[ hlat ] where the summation @xmath23 suns over all nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "if we apply the momentum - space rg transform of factor @xmath6 to ( [ hlat ] ) , the renormalized hamiltonian takes the following form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the symbol @xmath26 denotes summation over @xmath27 for each component of @xmath28 , @xmath29 denotes fourier components of @xmath30 , and s_b()= ( l / b)^-d _ ||/b e^i s ( ) is coarse - grained spin at @xmath31 . actually , higher terms such as @xmath32 are present in @xmath33 but they vanish as @xmath7 and @xmath6 become large .    note that @xmath34 by definition and there are only two kinds of interesting terms .",
    "if we set @xmath9 , the term ( [ hlbb ] ) is exactly the binder s parameter and we denote it by @xmath35 .",
    "the term ( [ hlbc ] ) vanishes if we set @xmath9 , so we must stop rg transform at @xmath36 .",
    "then it becomes , where @xmath37 .",
    "for simplicity , we use the following quantity : c_l [ cldef ] .",
    "recently , several different parameters have been proposed as the second parameter @xmath38 to estimate and eliminate the subleading scaling field .",
    "we will review these works in sec.ii a.    now consider the following matrix : = ( b_bl , c_bl ) ( _ 1,_1 ) ( ( b_l , c_l ) ( _ 1,_1 ) ) ^-1 = ( b_bl , c_bl ) ( _ b,_b ) ( ( b_l , c_l ) ( _ 1,_1 ) ) ^-1 instead of .    at the fixed point ,",
    "= ( b_bl , c_bl ) ( _ b,_b ) is satisfied and eigenvalues of @xmath39 coincide with that of @xmath40 as long as @xmath41 is a nonsingular matrix .    thus scaling behavior of renormalized parameters can be extracted from that of @xmath42 , as long as @xmath43 : if we draw arrows from@xmath42 to @xmath44 in the @xmath35-@xmath38 plane , the renormalization flow diagram of factor @xmath6 is obtained . from this diagram",
    ", one can determine whether the mc result is asymptotic enough or not , by checking whether @xmath42 converge to a fixed point .",
    "when a subleading scaling field is expected to be very large , such as in the recent monte carlo studies of five - dimensional ( 5d ) ising model @xcite , this rg flow diagram is very useful compared to a many parameter fit to a single observable @xmath35 .",
    "a linearized rgt matrix @xmath45 is calculated , for example , from linear fitting (    c b_bl ( , , ) + c_bl ( , , )    ) = * r*_b (    c b_l ( , , ) + c_l ( , , )    ) + (    c b_0 + c_0    ) [ lfit],where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are fitting parameters and we use values of @xmath48 and @xmath44 at several different parameters @xmath49 near the fixed point .",
    "selection of this parameter is a delicate problem : when it is too close to the fixed point , @xmath42 and @xmath44 become very close to each other and the rg flow is buried in statistical errors , while when it is far from the fixed point , nonlinear dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath50 induces a systematic error . thus the parameter range for the fitting",
    "should be determined carefully .",
    "of course @xmath51 can be calculated from @xmath49 derivatives of @xmath35 and @xmath38 at the fixed point .",
    "however , derivatives with respect to irrelevant direction vanish as @xmath7 becomes large and buried in statistical errors",
    ". thus values of @xmath52 at parameters well apart from the fixed point along an irrelevant direction are needed to calculate the second eigenvalue .",
    "here we compare our definition of @xmath38 , `` the second parameter '' ( the first one is the binder s parameter ) , with preceding works .",
    "ballesteros _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a finite - size correlation length defined below as ^2 , which is related to @xmath38 as @xmath53 .",
    "hasenbusch @xcite used the ratio between the partition function of a periodic and antiperiodic hamiltonian . in momentum representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian for an antiperiodic boundary condition ( apbc ) is obtained by replacing @xmath54 summation of the lattice hamiltonian by @xmath55 for each direction @xmath56 to which the apbc is imposed .",
    "let us denote the partition function of a periodic and antiperiodic hamiltonian by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "it then reads : z_a / z_p= ( -h_a ) ( -h_p ) = ( -h_p ) ( h_p - h_a ) ( -h_p ) = < ( h_p - h_a)>_p where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the periodic and antiperiodic hamiltonian , respectively , @xmath61 denotes average with respect to @xmath59 .",
    "when the apbc is imposed to a direction of @xmath62 , it reads h_a - h_p ~ _ 2|k_1| l ( ) ( - ) for large @xmath7 .",
    "one can see that @xmath63 has a similar form as that of @xmath38 . in the real - space rg scheme ,",
    "both @xmath38 and @xmath63 can be regarded as an effective coupling between two block spins defined on @xmath64 block .",
    "near the gaussian fixed point , finite - size behavior of @xmath35 and @xmath38 can be predicted from finite - size perturbation theory proposed by chen and dohm@xcite . note that",
    ", when @xmath2 , there is one kind of divergent subdiagram ( fig .",
    "[ fish ] ) whose factor is proportional to @xmath65 $ ] at the critical region , where @xmath66 are some constants .",
    "thus perturbation is restricted to the range @xmath67 and one can not set @xmath68 .",
    "however , the limit for @xmath7 rapidly diverges as we approach the gaussian fixed point , and good agreement between perturbation theory and monte carlo data is expected for a certain parameter range and lattice size .",
    "then one can predict scaling behavior for large @xmath7 , which is far beyond the computational limit of monte carlo simulation , from the perturbation theory .    here",
    "we investigate finite - size behavior of @xmath35 and @xmath38 at the finite - size critical point ( to one - loop order ) : = -12 l^-d_0 1 2 j ( ) where @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath35 takes the so - called zero - mode value : b_zm 2.1844 .    as for @xmath38 , to one - loop order ,    c_l = 8 ^ 2 . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath70^{-2 } \\sim a_1 + a_2 \\ln l$ ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are some positive constant .",
    "thus the plot of @xmath42 for a certain range of parameters including critical temperature approaches @xmath73 as @xmath7 increases or @xmath74 decreases , indicating that the gaussian fixed point is infrared stable",
    ". however , approach to the point @xmath73 for increasing @xmath7 is extremely slow , and one can not expect asymptotic gaussian behavior in mc simulations , even when @xmath7 is very large .",
    "critical exponents estimated from mc results may also differ from the gaussian ( classical ) value and depend on the bare parameters .",
    "thus one can extract only very restricted information from mc simulations at the upper critical dimension .",
    "we investigated the @xmath75 system with @xmath76 for @xmath21 and the @xmath77 system with @xmath78 for @xmath2 , imposing a periodic boundary condition on each directions .",
    "we used the following hamiltonian : h=2_<ij > ( s_i - s_j)^2 + 2 _ i s_i^2 + _ i s_i^4 where @xmath79 denotes the spin on the site @xmath5 . since we can not use the regularization condition @xmath80 before the simulation , we used the following one @xmath81 we used several fixed @xmath82 and tuned @xmath83 to reach the critical region .",
    "actual values of parameters are listed in the later sections .    for parameters",
    "well apart from the gaussian fixed point , @xmath84 single cluster flips @xcite and @xmath85 metropolis sweeps are performed between successive observations . in the cluster - update stage ,",
    "length of @xmath30 is kept fixed and only its sign is changed . in the metropolis update step ,",
    "a new value for @xmath30 is chosen uniformly from a range @xmath86 . by the cluster update ,",
    "all spins are flipped four times on average between observations . for all observed quantities ,",
    "the correlation coefficient between successively observed values was less than @xmath87 .",
    "as we approach the gaussian fixed point , parameters behave as follows : ~0 ~ .",
    "thus the nearest neighbor coupling @xmath88 tends to diverge .",
    "since the bond - cutting probability of wolff s algorithm is @xmath89 , the cluster update tends to end up with flipping the whole system and does not accelerate the simulation . in these cases",
    "we increased the number of metropolis sweeps until the above mentioned condition is satisfied .",
    "thermal averages of observables at @xmath83 slightly away from the actually used value were calculated using reweighting techniques @xcite . for all system sizes ,",
    "at least @xmath90 observations were done after thermalization , and statistical errors were estimated by the jack - knife procedure .",
    "multiplicative lagged fibonacci sequence @xmath91 was used as a random number generator .",
    "all runs were performed on vpp-300 at jaeri .",
    "simulations were performed at the following parameters ( see also fig . [ ab0 ] ) for @xmath76 ;    ising case : : :    @xmath92 case a : : :    @xmath93 case b : : :    @xmath94 case c : : :    @xmath95 case d : : :    @xmath96 .    figure [ rg3mc ] shows the rg flow diagram of @xmath35 and @xmath38 near the wilson - fisher rg fixed point .",
    "all lines are drawn from @xmath42 to @xmath97 . dashed and",
    "solid lines correspond to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "one can see that the rg flow shown in fig .",
    "[ rgf3 ] is well reproduced .",
    "moreover , the linear fitting procedure ( [ lfit ] ) provides an estimate for critical exponents as @xmath100 , @xmath101 from @xmath102 data and @xmath103 from @xmath104 data , which is in agreement with the most recent @xmath105-expansion result @xmath106 @xcite and the monte carlo result @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "thus one can see that the two observables @xmath35 and @xmath38 are enough to capture the essential rg flow .",
    "simulations were performed at the following parameters ,    ising case : : :    @xmath108 case a : : :    @xmath109 case b : : :    @xmath110    for @xmath111 and @xmath85 . near the gaussian fixed point ( case b ) , there is a severe , critical slowing down ( owing to large fluctuation of the @xmath112 mode ) , which can not be removed by the cluster update , and we did not perform @xmath99 simulation . for case",
    "b , perturbation expansion agrees well with the mc result : fig.[bl4d](a ) and [ bl4d](b ) show the plot of @xmath35 and @xmath38 , respectively , against @xmath113 for fixed @xmath114 , together with perturbation results .",
    "note that there are no free parameters to be fitted , unlike the ising case @xcite , and the agreement is both qualitative and quantitative .",
    "figure [ rgmc4 ] shows a rg flow diagram of @xmath35 and @xmath38 obtained from mc simulations .",
    "all lines are drawn from @xmath42 to @xmath97 . dashed and",
    "solid lines correspond to @xmath115 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "simulations at a parameter closer to the gaussian fixed point than case b are very difficult owing to aforementioned critical slowing down .",
    "instead , finite - size perturbation provides reliable results near the gaussian fixed point and it indicates that the plot of @xmath42 approaches the gaussian fixed point as @xmath7 increases . thus one can conclude that there is no rg fixed point except for the infrared - stable gaussian fixed point .",
    "the renormalization - group flow diagram obtained by the method presented in this paper provides qualitative information such as the stability of a specific rg fixed point against some perturbation , as well as quantitative improvement of the estimated value of a critical exponent by eliminating leading correction - to - scaling terms .",
    "however , in lattice models , there exists @xmath116 systematic error owing to the substitution of integral by finite summation of @xmath117 mesh , and one can not get rid of this as long as the finite lattice system is concerned .    our method can be easily extended to @xmath1 models with several or unusual quartic coupling constant(s ) : h = dx ( ) ^2 + ^2 + _",
    "n _ n _ ijklc_ijkl(n ) _ i _ j _ k _ l , such as the chiral @xmath118 model of a triangular antiferromagnet @xcite , and the ginzburg - landau model of a type - ii superconductor under a weak or strong magnetic field , with or without point / columnar impurities ( see @xcite for transition of a pure system under a strong field ) .",
    "the multiple quartic term tends to generate an irrelevant operator whose correction exponent is very small , making it difficult to observe asymptotic behavior in mc simulations",
    ". thus critical behavior of these models has been a controversial issue and application of the mcrg method to these models seems very interesting .",
    "a rg flow diagram of regularized quartic terms @xmath119 will reveal the critical behavior , as in ref.@xcite of the @xmath120 antiferromagnetic potts model .",
    "another important problem is the estimation of the correction exponent for the @xmath121 term at the wf fixed point .",
    "an @xmath105 expansion analysis indicates that it becomes positive at the wf fixed point @xcite .",
    "however , whether the exponent is larger or smaller than @xmath122 of @xmath1 theory , which we assumed as a _ leading _ correction , should be confirmed numerically .",
    "similarly , the effect of sixfold anisotropy on the critical behavior of a three - dimensional xy model is another interesting subject since the anisotropy is expressed by the @xmath123 term ."
