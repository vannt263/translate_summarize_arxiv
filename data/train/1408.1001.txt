    "extreme events have fundamental importance to life , as they are often associated with survival and losses . ",
    "extreme events to do with gains or amusement receive far less attention in general , dissociated from individual events .",
    "rare and large magnitude events of interest arise in physical , technological , social , and other systems  @xcite .",
    "the classical theory of extremes in uncorrelated sequences ( or , in sequences in which the auto - correlation is decaying sufficiently fast )  @xcite has a statistical orientation ; it is not- and can not be concerned with _ prediction _ or with uncovering mechanisms that can produce extremes ; but it is rather concerned with e.g. expected return times , which can be useful in designing structures of a certain required life time , such as sea walls  @xcite .",
    "since newton revolutionized science , it has become a paradigm that predictions should be based on validated models .",
    "these models describing fluctuating phenomena often take the form of a system of differential equations , also referred to as a _ dynamical system_. since the work of lorenz it has become clear that even though some phenomena can be modeled quite accurately , they can be inherently unpredictable because of their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "such systems are called chaotic , characterized by positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "this imposes a time horizon on predictions ; beyond that only statistical properties can be robustly estimated , which is what classical extreme value theory is concerned with . in contrast with that , in our analysis we consider prediction lead times shorter than the decorrelation time in a time series .    in the context of",
    "model - based or _",
    "model - driven _ predictions ( mdp ) equivalent with initial value problems for deterministic differential equations , like e.g. a weather forecast , one can often read that extremes are much harder to predict .",
    "unfortunately a systematic study of the dependence of some appropriate prediction skill score  or a measure of predictability in a more general sense  of any model on the magnitude of events is still lacking .",
    "inaccuracy of the model may be an important factor leading to such a dependence of its prediction skill on the event magnitude , beside details of its chaotic nature .",
    "in contrast , in pure _ data - driven _ prediction ( ddp ) , model errors are not present , as the basis of the prediction ( of any kind ) does not involve a model in the form of equations or an algorithm , only observational / measurement data . instead , beyond errors in measuring the present conditions ( as with initial conditions for mdp ) , the prediction is compromised by the finite size of the data set .",
    "that is , the said virtue of ddp can be exploited  when employing it in its pure form  only if enough and good quality data ( with a high precision of observation and high signal - to - noise ratio ) is available  @xcite",
    ".    one might expect that the slogan that ` extremes in comparison with more moderate events are harder to predict ' extends to ddp .",
    "in fact , just the opposite has been reported by hallerberg and kantz  @xcite for simple autoregressive processes at least , indifferently to whether the probability distribution is exponentially decaying or according to a power - law , and also for some observational data  @xcite : _ stronger events are easier to predict_. this counter - intuitive statement is based on a measure of prediction skill that derives from the so - called _ receiver operating characteristic _ ( roc ) _ curve _",
    "@xcite that takes into account the true positives  meaning that an event is correctly predicted to happen  as well as the false negatives . concerning rare events , such a measure of prediction skill",
    "is regarded  @xcite more meaningful than other _ proper _",
    "@xcite so - called _ skill scores _ for probabilistic predictions like the brier or ignorance scores .",
    "this is so , because the roc statistics has been viewed to not depend on the relative frequency of events ( only that the accurate evaluation of the statistics requires a sufficient number of events ) .",
    "the latter characteristic is thought to allow for the comparison of the roc - predictability of events between two situations where the events have different frequency  @xcite .",
    "whether the above statement  @xcite can be _ maintained _ in case of more complex processes has been an open question so far  addressed but not settled with a consensus .",
    "recently two studies  @xcite have been published concerning the predictability of extreme events in dynamical systems with seemingly contradictory results as to whether stronger events are more predictable .",
    "franzke  @xcite applied the method set out in  @xcite to predict extreme threshold exceedances in a systematically derived stochastic dynamical system representing climate variability by the resolved ( slow ) variable(s ) and weather variability by noise in place of the unresolved ( fast ) variable(s )  @xcite .",
    "he maintained the earlier statement  @xcite in this case , measuring the prediction skill by the roc statistics , but on the basis of considering only two high threshold values . on the other hand , sterk et al .",
    "@xcite considered a number of dynamical systems of various complexity , and various physical observables .",
    "they evaluated finite - time maximal lyapunov exponents ( ftmle ) of trajectories that lead to extremes , and concluded that no generally applicable statements can be made , but the predictability of extremes depends on the system ( and so the attractor geometry ) and on the observable in question , as well as the prediction lead time .",
    "we emphasize that in their study the authors did not take model errors into account .    to summarize the essence of the above review , we can list three different views encountered in the literature regarding the predictability of extremes :    ( 1 ) : :    stronger extremes are better predictable . ( 2 )",
    ": :    stronger extremes are less predictable .",
    "( 3 ) : :    stronger extremes can be better or less predictable depending on    various factors .    without giving details , e.g. assumptions of these statements ,",
    "they seem to be contradictory to each other . on this basis",
    "we set out the following objectives for the present paper :    ( i ) : :    keeping to the assumption of ( 1 ) , we evaluate the predictability of    _ peak - over - threshold _ events measured by a roc - based quantity , using    time series data of finite length produced by the lorenz-84    model  @xcite . with an attention to ( 3 ) , we evaluate ( i.a ) the    dependence of predictability _ itself _ on various factors , and also    what is more relevant to the question : ( i.b ) the magnitude - dependence    of predictability  whether increasing / decreasing or nonmonotonic ",
    "depending on some of those same factors .",
    "( ii ) : :    we argue for an analogy between a certain class of ddps and mdp , and    that the latter is usually understood as something that below we will    refer to as an _ on - demand _ mdp , in which case any input data belongs    to a single time instant .",
    "we believe this is an assumption of ( 2 ) .",
    "this objective ( ii ) is to reconcile ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , suggesting that ( 2 )    can be true when model errors are present , even if the predictability    is measured by the same roc - based quantity as that assumed by ( 1 ) .",
    "( iii ) : :    for on - demand mdp and the analogous ddp where the time of input is    arbitrary , we will be able to carry out an assessment of the lead    time - dependence of the predictability of what we will call    _ threshold - exceedance - in - an - interval _ events in a straightforward    manner .",
    "this will turn out to have a bearing on the    magnitude - dependence of predictability . this objective ( iii ) together    with ( i.b ) are to revisit point ( 1 ) , possibly extending that point    from stochastic processes to dynamical systems .",
    "( iv ) : :    however , to show that ( 3 ) does not necessarily contradict ( 1 ) , we    recall that ( 3 ) was stated on the basis of measuring predictability by    ftmles .",
    "this also assumes an arbitrary input time on - demand mdp or    analogous ddp .",
    "accordingly , in the autonomous l84 we calculate the    ftmles of trajectories that lead to extremes , and compare their    average to the roc - based measure of prediction skill  looking for any    qualitative mismatch .    to motivate our top objective ( i ) and ( iii ) we remark that    ddp is gaining increasing prominence nowadays given that data is relatively much more easily accessible than models .",
    "this is certainly the case with geophysical phenomena that we are primarily interested in , such as meteorology .",
    "furthermore , performing predictions based on data can be far less costly than those based on simulating complex models , while the skill may not be much worse  @xcite .",
    "next we recapitulate the methodology of the applied prediction scheme and the used roc - based measure of prediction skill .",
    "lorenz s 1984 model of global atmospheric circulation , simulated to produce time series data for the purpose of assessing the predictability of threshold exeedance events , is also briefly described .",
    "subsequently , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our results on the dependence of predictability on several factors , such as : the makeup of the so - called precursory structure  made use for a prediction  in terms of the observables involved , the prediction lead time , and the magnitude of extreme events .",
    "these results pertaining to objectives ( i ) and ( iii ) are summarized in a compact table format in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] and discussed subsequently regarding objectives ( ii ) and ( iv ) . to close our presentation",
    "we pose a few open questions for future research into practical aspects of the prediction of extremes , which might potentially have theoretical ramifications .",
    "we provide in appendices [ sec : max_find_alg ] and [ sec : pred_model_driv ] , respectively , the description of an algorithm for finding the maximum of a function of one variable and a definition of the finite - time lyapunov exponents .",
    "our aim is to predict large excursions of some ( scalar ) physical observable @xmath0 , exceeding a chosen threshold level @xmath1 , before that exceedance happens .",
    "figure [ fig : time_history ] pictures the situation as the observable evolves _ continuously _ in time , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , occasionally exceeding the threshold .",
    "we intend to examine situations when @xmath4 is generated by a process that can be described by an ordinary or stochastic differential equation , examples of which for our case study will be briefly described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "when one does not have a validated model , only the time series @xmath4 , one can still perform ddp ; when the opposite is the case , one can do mdp .",
    "the following methodological description regarding the prediction task closely follows  @xcite .",
    "it applies to ddp as well as mdp , on which we comment in the end of this section .",
    "we introduce a discrete - time _ binary _ event variable :    @xmath5    where the times @xmath6 , @xmath7 , belong to consecutive apexes , that is , local maxima or peaks , of the continuous evolution of @xmath0 for consecutive values of @xmath8 , and in general they are not equally ` spaced ' .",
    "thereby the continuous - time evolution is _",
    "discretized_. ( this can be viewed as a restriction on generality , and it will be relaxed further below . ) this approach is often referred to as the peak - over - threshold ( pot ) approach . the prediction is based on a like - wise discrete - time precursory structure @xmath9 of size @xmath10 , whose different members , observables desirably related to @xmath0 , may belong to different times , e.g. @xmath11 , preceding the current time @xmath6 , specified by delays @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",

    "( [ eq : likelihood ] ) expresses bayes theorem relating the conditional probabilities : the likelihood and the posterior probability .",
    "our prediction @xmath26 is controlled by a threshold @xmath27 $ ] of stringency on @xmath28 .",
    "note that an actual choice is meant to be made as to the applied value of @xmath29 in practice , for which reason this kind of prediction is not probabilistic , but we call it a categoric prediction .    depending on @xmath29 , the rate of true positives , or the _ hit rate _ ,",
    "i.e. , the frequency of making correct predictions , yields as follows :    @xmath30    in the above @xmath31 is a volume element in the precursory space , and @xmath32 is the heaviside step function .",
    "another measure of the overall goodness or skill of prediction is the",

    "another roc curve is also shown , to be referred to as @xmath40-roc curve , obtained by writing within the scope of the heaviside function in the definitions ( [ eq : hit_rate ] ) , ( [ eq : far ] ) , and also in ( [ eq : chi_hat ] ) , @xmath40 instead of @xmath28 and @xmath41 instead of @xmath29 .",

    "furthermore , the @xmath28-roc curve is always concave  @xcite , while the @xmath40-roc curve is not necessarily concave . besides , in accordance with the above statement on the trade - off situation , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 are all monotonic functions , and , therefore",

    "the ideal situation when extreme events ( @xmath52 ) and nonevents ( @xmath53 ) can be predicted with certainty ( @xmath54 ) is represented by the @xmath55 corner in the roc diagram . in this case",
    "no choice has to be made on the applied stringency @xmath29 .",
    "clearly this is possible only in case of the deterministic but not the stochastic version of a model , and there are further factors  to be demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ]  that can compromise the prediction skill . in the nonideal situation",
    "an optimal @xmath29 is to be chosen . a unique optimum exists only in terms of a single - objective optimization problem , defined by a scalar - valued cost function .",
    "however , in our case the minimization of the false alarm rate and the maximization of the hit rate are both ` valid ' objectives .",
    "it takes a _ specific application _ to be possibly able to define a scalar - valued cost function @xmath56 . for our _ general assessment _ of predictability",
    "we choose to consider the intuitive measure :    @xmath57    the distance of the roc curve from the ideal corner . with no prediction skill at all : @xmath58 .",
    "other summary statistics for the roc curve have also been defined , such as the area under the curve  @xcite , or the slope @xmath59  @xcite . unlike these two",
    ", the distance @xmath60 can be associated to actual predictions specified by an actual choice for @xmath29 .",
    "we note that it is not trivial to interpret what the comparison of @xmath60 with a proper skill score of probabilistic prediction means .",
    "perhaps the most obvious factor that compromises the prediction skill in the data - driven framework is the finite size @xmath61 of the data set : @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the distributions @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath64 will be approximated in our study by histograms @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , of a certain uniform bin size @xmath69 ; different values of @xmath70 can be assigned to the different bins by a sensible algorithm .",
    "let us denote by @xmath71 the unique linear bin size applied in all @xmath10 dimensions after suitable nondimensionalization .",

    "( [ eq : likelihood ] ) . with the discrete formulation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hit_rate ] ) and ( [ eq : far ] ) , accordingly , the roc curve turns into ( the graph of ) a staircase ( function ) , given by a set of discrete data points : @xmath72 , @xmath68 , belonging to stringency levels @xmath73 :    @xmath74    note that in the above the histograms @xmath65 and @xmath66 do not need to be normalized ; and e.g. @xmath67 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , denote the same set .",

    "this entails an appropriate sign of the bias of the estimator , and a standard deviation of the estimator much smaller than the modulus of the bias .",

    "an approach to fix this problem is the following .",
    "the available data is divided equally into ` training ' and ` evaluation ' data sets .",
    "then , the conservative estimates are defined again by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hit_rate_discr ] ) and ( [ eq : far_discr ] ) , but the different terms appearing in them are associated with different data sets : @xmath67 is derived from the training data set , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are derived from the evaluation data set . note that the latter requires the use of the same grid forming the bins in case of the training and evaluation data sets .    a further issue to do with small bin sizes when many bins contain",
    "a single data point is that the ` roc staircase ' can have an excessively large _",
    "last _ step .",
    "this is so , because bins that contain single data points tend to have empty counterparts mutually between the ` training ' and ` evaluation ' data sets .",
    "this way @xmath80 can even be realized .",
    "too large bin sizes would of course also deteriorate the prediction skill .",
    "therefore , there should be an _",
    "optimal _ bin size yielding ( locally ) minimal @xmath60 .",
    "our numerical experience shows that there is always , for any given prediction lead time or threshold level @xmath1 , a unique ( globally ) optimal _ uniform _ bin size defining the _ regular _ grid .",
    "we note finally that the above description of evaluating predictability applies clearly to the case of data - driven prediction .",
    "however , evaluating the model - driven predictability of binary exceedance events measured by the same roc - based measure of prediction skill can be done in exactly the same way : by simulating long trajectories of the model and by binning the resulting time series data .",
    "this is more obviously true when mdp is thought of in the sense that the complete pdfs , @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath64 , or rather the histograms , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , are established preliminary to making any predictions .",
    "we will refer to such an mdp as an ` archival ' mdp .",
    "note that in this sense any ddp is archival .",
    "the archival mdp and the corresponding ddp differ only in that in principle unlimited data is available to establish the pdfs for mdp .",
    "but mdp can be thought of also in the sense that the model is only simulated ` on - demand ' , to produce an ensemble forecast from which the likelihood of a threshold exceedance can be established .",
    "the case of on - demand mdp corresponds to imposing a constraint on archival mdp or ddp , namely that the components of the precursory structure @xmath20 of the archival mdp or ddp belong to the same time instant ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 $ ] ) , @xmath20 thereby representing the _ initial conditions _ for the on - demand mdp .",
    "note that it is allowed that @xmath20 excludes some variables that determine the considered phenomenon ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 being the dimension of the phase space , as detailed in appendix [ sec : pred_model_driv ] ) ; the excluded variables can be initialized arbitrarily , or possibly as a random sample from a probability distribution .",
    "we refer here to the practice of stochastic parametrization of unresolved processes in weather forecast models .    as for the definition of the binary event in case of on - demand mdp the following",
    "can also be taken : in an event a chosen observable exceeds a set threshold in a chosen future time interval , defined by a leading window of width @xmath85 at a lead time @xmath86 ahead of the present time .",
    "let us call this an event of _ threshold exceedance in an interval _ ( tei event in short ) .",
    "in contrast to considering the threshold exceedance of apexes of the time evolution , i.e. , pot events , here @xmath86 can be set arbitrarily , not restricted to discrete values ; accordingly , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are defined in continuous - time .",
    "we will take this approach when assessing predictability with respect to the prediction lead time in sec .",
    "[ sec : lead_time ] .",
    "the bin size @xmath71 for a ddp would in this case correspond roughly to the precision @xmath89 of measuring initial conditions for a mdp .",
    "( the difference is that @xmath71 corresponds to averaging of the distributions , e.g. @xmath64 , over predefined fixed bins , whereas @xmath89 corresponds to a smoothing of the distribution : @xmath90 , where @xmath89 can be thought of as the standard deviation of the measurement error distribution @xmath91 . ) in order to well - approximate the skill of mdp for a given measurement precision , the time series has to be long enough so that the likelihood for all bins , even those which cover a relatively small portion of the invariant measure of the attractor , is well - approximated on the first place . that is , the ratio of the prediction skill of ddp and that of mdp ( with no model errors ) , which is always smaller than unity , depends on @xmath92 .",
    "we carry out the assessment of the predictability of extremes in a model of geophysical relevance .",
    "it constitutes a nonlinear dynamical system featuring complex chaotic deterministic dynamics .",
    "yet , it is simple enough  involving just three scalar prognostic variables  to yield time series data relatively inexpensively , and to allow for a more tangible demonstration of some aspects of predictability .",
    "our choice of a model , lorenz s model of global atmospheric circulation ( l84 ) with standard parameter settings , reads as follows  @xcite :    @xmath93    the model describes  in a very coarse manner  @xcite  the meridional heat transport via eddies , represented by principal mode amplitudes @xmath94 and @xmath95 , given rise by the baroclininc instability of the midlatitude jet , represented by its average speed @xmath0 .",
    "the instability occurs for appropriate conditions defined by the large scale meridional temperature gradient , represented in the model by @xmath96 , due to differential heating between the equator and the poles .",

    "this model enjoys popularity in teaching  @xcite as well as theoretically oriented weather and climate research  @xcite .",
    "we will examine the autonomous dynamics in perpetual winter conditions realized by , say , @xmath97 , since this gives rise to chaotic dynamics , which is nontrivial from the point of view of predictability .",
    "let us label the autonomous dynamics / model by m1 , as a synonym of ( [ eq : l84 ] ) , when the forcing takes the above indicated form . in order to assess the dependence of predictability on intrinsic system properties , according to objective ( i.a ) , we will consider also nonautonomous dynamics .",
    "it is achieved by introducing some driving or time - dependent forcing to the l84 system in the form of @xmath98 , where the fluctuating process ( in a mathematical sense ) @xmath99 can be seen as an unresolved , i.e. , physically not modeled , ( physical ) process . however , from the point of view of data - driven predictability , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : pred_data_driv ] , autonomous and nonautonomous systems are not distinguished  the _ driving mimics additional degrees of freedom _ of the system .",

    "<S> in a low - order model of the general circulation of the atmosphere we examine the predictability of threshold exceedance events of certain observables . </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood of such binary events  the cornerstone also for the _ categoric _ ( as opposed to probabilistic ) prediction of threshold exceedences  is established from long time series of one or more observables of the same system . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction skill is measured by a summary index of the roc curve that relates the hit- and false alarm rates . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the examined systems suggest that _ exceedances of higher thresholds are more predictable _ ; or in other words : rare large magnitude , i.e. , extreme , events are more predictable than frequent typical events . </S>",
    "<S> we find this to hold provided that the bin size for binning time series data is optimized , but not necessarily otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> this can be viewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive ( and seemingly contrafactual ) statement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive stochastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> however , we argue that for dynamical systems in general it may be typical only , but not universally true . we argue that when there is a sufficient amount of data depending on the precision of observation , the skill of a class of data - driven categoric predictions of threshold exceedences approximates the skill of the analogous model - driven prediction , assuming strictly no model errors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , stronger extremes in terms of higher threshold levels are more predictable both in case of data- and model - driven prediction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that a quantity commonly regarded as a measure of predictability , the finite - time maximal lyapunov exponent , does not correspond directly to the roc - based measure of prediction skill when they are viewed as functions of the prediction lead time and the threshold level . </S>",
    "<S> this points to the fact that even if the lyapunov exponent as an intrinsic property of the system , measuring the instability of trajectories , determines predictability , it does that in a nontrivial manner .    </S>",
    "<S> extreme event , data - driven prediction , precursory structure , prediction skill , roc curve , finite - time lyapunov exponent </S>"
