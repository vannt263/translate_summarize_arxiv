    "1 gives rise to a small kink in @xmath127 associated with the energy @xmath126 at which the transverse phonon begins to contribute to the pairing interaction , this is a small feature and plays no role in determining @xmath128.@xcite therefore , within the bcs framework , the fact that @xmath3 is close to the energy of a kohn anomaly @xmath126 , must be viewed as a coincidence .",
