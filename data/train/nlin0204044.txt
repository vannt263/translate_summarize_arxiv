    "in recent years , considerable progress has been achieved in the understanding of intermittency and anomalous scaling of fluid turbulence . the crucial role in these studies was played by a simple model of a passive scalar quantity advected by a random gaussian field , white in time and self - similar in space , the so - called kraichnan s rapid - change model @xcite . there , for the first time the existence of anomalous scaling was established on the basis of a microscopic model @xcite and the corresponding anomalous exponents were calculated within controlled approximations @xcite and a systematic perturbation expansion in a formal small parameter @xcite .",
    "detailed review of the recent theoretical research on the passive scalar problem and the bibliography can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    within the approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , nontrivial anomalous exponents are related to  zero modes , \" that is , homogeneous solutions of the closed exact differential equations satisfied by the equal - time correlation functions . in this sense , the rapid - change model appears `` exactly solvable . ''    in a wider context , zero modes can be interpreted as statistical conservation laws of the particle dynamics @xcite .",
    "the concept of statistical conservation laws appears rather general , being also confirmed in numerical simulations by refs .",
    "@xcite , where the passive advection in the two - dimensional navier  stokes velocity field @xcite and a shell model of a passive scalar @xcite were studied .",
    "this observation is rather intriguing because in those models no closed equations for equal - time quantities can be derived due to the fact that the advecting velocity has a finite correlation time ( for a passive field advected by a velocity with given statistics , closed equations can be derived only for different - time correlation functions , and they involve infinite diagrammatic series ) .    one may thus conclude that breaking the artificial assumption of the time decorrelation of the velocity field is the crucial point @xcite .",
    "an important issue related to the effects of the finite correlation time is the universality of the anomalous exponents .",
    "it was argued that the exponents may depend on more details of the velocity statistics than only the exponents @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this idea was supported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the case of short but finite correlation time was considered for the special case of a local turnover exponent . in those studies , the anomalous exponents were derived to first order in small correlation time , with kraichnan s rapid - change model @xcite or analogous shell model for a scalar field @xcite taken as zeroth order approximations .",
    "the exponents obtained appear nonuniversal through the dependence on the correlation time .    in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequent papers @xcite , the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) and operator product expansion ( ope ) were applied to the rapid - change model and its descendants . in that approach ,",
    "anomalous scaling emerges as a consequence of the existence in the model of composite operators with negative scaling dimensions , identified with the anomalous exponents .",
    "this allows one to construct a systematic perturbation expansion for the anomalous exponents , analogous to the famous @xmath6 expansion in the rg theory of critical behavior , and to calculate the exponents to the second @xcite and third @xcite orders . for passively advected",
    "_ vector _ fields , any calculation of the exponents for higher - order correlations calls for the rg techniques already in the lowest - order approximation @xcite .    besides the calculational efficiency , an important advantage of the rg approach is its relative universality : it is not related to the aforementioned solvability of the rapid - change model and can also be applied to the case of finite correlation time or non - gaussian advecting field . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for the case of compressible flow ) the rg and ope were applied to the problem of a passive scalar advected by a gaussian self - similar velocity with finite ( and not small ) correlation time .",
    "the energy spectrum of the velocity in the inertial range has the form @xmath0 , while the correlation time at the wavenumber @xmath1 scales as @xmath2 .",
    "it was shown that , depending on the values of the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath10 , the model reveals various types of inertial - range scaling regimes with nontrivial anomalous exponents . for @xmath3 ,",
    "they coincide with the exponents of the rapid - change model and depend on the only parameter @xmath12 , while for @xmath13 they coincide with the exponents of the opposite ( `` quenched '' or `` frozen '' ) case and depend only on @xmath6 .",
    "the most interesting case is @xmath14 , when the exponents can be nonuniversal through the dependence on the correlation time ( more precisely , on the ratio @xmath15 of the velocity correlation time and the turnover time of the passive scalar ) . in the field",
    "theoretic language , the nonuniversality of the exponents in this regime is a consequence of the degeneracy of the corresponding fixed point of the rg equations .",
    "it agrees with the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite since the borderline @xmath14 , including the `` kolmogorov '' point @xmath16 , corresponds to the case of a local turnover exponent .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the same relation @xmath14 for the boundary between the time - decorrelated and quenched cases is encountered in a model of passive advection by a strongly anisotropic flow , studied in refs .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the same boundary will be observed with very general assumptions on the velocity statistics .",
    "although the possibility of the nonuniversality of anomalous exponents for @xmath14 was demonstrated by the rigorous rg analysis , the practical calculation by ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that they appear universal ( independent of @xmath15 ) to the first order in @xmath6 and @xmath10 : in the one - loop approximation , the anomalous dimensions of the relevant composite operators depend on a combination of the model parameters ( couplings ) that remains constant along the line of the fixed points .",
    "this fact is rather disappointing , because it means that in the one - loop approximation it is impossible to judge how the finite correlation time affects intermittency , in particular , whether the anomalous scaling is enhanced or suppressed in comparison with the rapid - change or quenched limits .    in this paper , we present the anomalous exponents to order @xmath7 ( two - loop approximation ) for the most interesting case @xmath14 , including the exponents of the anisotropic contributions , and study their dependence on @xmath15 .",

    "although the anomalous exponents have a well - defined limits for @xmath18 , they show interesting irregularities in the vicinity of the quenched limit : a rapid falloff when @xmath23 increases from zero , with infinite slope for @xmath21 , with a pronounced minimum for @xmath24 . on the contrary ,",

    "( [ beta ] ) the exact relation @xmath76 follows which shows that the @xmath71 functions can not vanish simultaneously for finite values of their arguments , except for the case @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , to find the fixed points we must set either @xmath22 or @xmath23 and simultaneously rescale @xmath66 so that the anomalous dimension @xmath75 remain finite .",
    "these two options correspond to the two limits ( [ rc1 ] ) and ( [ rc2 ] ) , so that the rapid - change and quenched cases are fixed points of the general model .",
    "the analysis shows that the former is ir stable ( and thus describes the inertial - range asymptotic behavior ) for @xmath3 while the latter is stable for @xmath4 .",
    "most interesting is the case @xmath14 , when the @xmath71 functions become proportional , and the set @xmath77 reduces to a single equation . as a result , the corresponding fixed point is degenerate : rather than a point , one obtains a line of fixed points in the @xmath66@xmath15 plane .",
    "they can be labelled by the value of the parameter @xmath15 , which has the meaning of the ratio of the velocity correlation time and the scalar turnover time .",

    "the scaling functions @xmath82 can be decomposed in irreducible representations of the @xmath83 group . in the simplest case of uniaxial anisotropy ( which is sufficient to reveal _ all _ anomalous exponents )",
    "one can write @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath86th order gegenbauer polynomial ( legendre polynomial for @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 is a unit vector that determines the distinguished direction .",
    "the leading behavior of the functions @xmath89 for @xmath90 ( inertial range ) is found from the corresponding operator product expansion and has the form @xmath91 where the `` anomalous exponent '' @xmath92 is nothing other than the critical dimension of the irreducible traceless @xmath86th rank tensor composite operator built of @xmath8 fields @xmath93 and minimal possible number of derivatives @xcite .",
    "for @xmath94 such an operator has the form @xmath95 here the dots stand for the appropriate subtractions involving the kronecker @xmath96 symbols , which ensure that the resulting expressions are traceless with respect to any given pair of indices , for example , @xmath97 .",
    "we also note that the numbers @xmath8 and @xmath86 necessarily have the same parity , that is , they can only be simultaneously even or odd .",
    "for the most interesting case of the degenerate fixed point , the dimensions @xmath92 are calculated in the form of series in the only independent exponent @xmath5 , that is , @xmath98 in the lowest order one obtains @xcite : @xmath99 with @xmath100 . for @xmath101 ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath102 depend not only on @xmath9 but also on the parameter @xmath15 , the ratio of the velocity correlation time and the scalar turnover time , that labels fixed points in the @xmath66@xmath15 plane ( see above ) .",

    "@xcite in detail .",
    "analogous calculations for the finite correlated case are more difficult in two respects . first , there are more relevant feynman diagrams in the same order of perturbation theory ( for zero correlation time , many diagrams contain closed circuits of retarded propagators and vanish ) .",
    "second , and more important distinction , is that the diagrams for the finite correlated case involve _ two _ different dispersion laws : @xmath104 for the scalar and @xmath105 for the velocity fields . as a result , the calculation , as well as",
    "expressions for the renormalization constants , become rather cumbersome already in the lowest ( one - loop ) approximation ; see refs .  @xcite .",
    "the latter difficulty can be circumvented as follows .",
    "careful analysis shows that in the ms scheme all the needed anomalous dimensions , @xmath75 from ( [ beta ] ) and @xmath106 , in contrast with the respective renormalization constants @xmath107 and @xmath108 , are independent of the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath10 in the two - loop approximation ( for the one - loop approximation this is obvious from the explicit expressions ; see @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus sufficient to calculate them for any specific choice of the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath10 that guarantees uv finiteness of the diagrams .",
    "the most convenient choice is @xmath109 and arbitrary @xmath6 : all the diagrams remain finite , the exponents in the aforementioned dispersion laws become identical , and the practical calculations drastically simplify and become feasible .    to avoid possible misunderstandings",
    ", it should be emphasized that such an independence is _ not _ guaranteed by the renormalizability of the model .",
    "the renormalizability in the analytic regularization only guarantees that the renormalization scheme can be chosen such that the correlation functions , along with the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath110 in the rg equations , will be analytic at the origin in the space of two complex variables @xmath6 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we used another scheme in which the functions @xmath71 and @xmath110 are _ independent _ of @xmath6 and @xmath10 in the first two orders , which does not exclude _ nonanalytic _ dependence on these parameters in higher orders .",
    "we expect that in the three - loop approximation nonanalytic constructions like @xmath111 will indeed appear in the anomalous dimensions , in particular , due to the necessity to take into account uv finite parts of the two - loop diagrams ( with our choice of the sharp ir cutoff in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , the one - loop diagrams have no uv finite parts ; cf .",
    "@xcite for the rapid - change case ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the knowledge of the renormalization constants for @xmath109 is sufficient to obtain the anomalous dimensions , @xmath71 functions , coordinates of the fixed points , and the critical dimensions of composite operators for arbitrary values of @xmath10 and @xmath6 , including the most interesting case @xmath14 , which we always discuss from now on .",
