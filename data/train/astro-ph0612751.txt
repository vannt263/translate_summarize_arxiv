    "x - ray spectral observations of accretion powered black holes in binary systems show that there are at least two spectral components present .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the higher energy , power - law component reflects the presence of a possibly geometrically thick but optically thin , hot corona .",
    "the relative importance of these components changes with time , especially during periods of strong variability when these sources undergo outbursts . if the power - law component dominates , the state is called low / hard ( lh ) state , while if the black - body dominates the state is called high / soft ( hs ) state . the nomenclature",
    "hard / soft reflects the shape of the spectrum , while high / low reflects the presumed accretion rate in these states . for a review on spectral states ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in general this picture holds for high - mass black holes , i.e. agn ( active galactic nuclei ) , as well .",
    "however the low - mass black holes , i.e. x - ray binaries , are the best studied objects with regards to the temporal behaviour . there",
    "the timescale for outbursts is on the order of weeks to months and years , while in agn it is much longer .",
    "hence theoretical models of accretion flows around black holes concerning the long - term stability properties are observationally best tested against x - ray binaries .",
    "many authors have addressed the thermal and physical states of the accretion flow in these systems .",
    "much of the work has concentrated on what is required of the thermal and physical states of the accretion flow in order to reproduce the x - ray spectra . in these papers ,",
    "the system is usually assumed to be in a steady configuration , and the effort is devoted to computation of the resulting spectrum .",
    "there has also been consideration given to physical and thermal interactions between the proposed cool ( disc ) and hot ( corona ) plasmas , and it is these considerations which have the strongest bearing on the time - dependent behaviour of the flow .",
    "we briefly discuss some of this work .",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduced the concept of a two - phase accretion model .",
    "their disc consists of an inner , hot , optically thin and geometrically thick corona , and an outer , standard , optically thick , but geometrically thin , disc .",
    "the plasma in the inner parts of the corona is a two - temperature plasma , where electrons and ions interact via coulomb collisions .",
    "the main aim of the model was to provide an explanation of the spectrum of cyg x-1 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite present models for spectra of seyfert galaxies given three different underlying assumptions on the flow geometry .",
    "they discuss a  sandwich  geometry where the corona and the disc literally form a sandwich .",
    "corona and disc are either separated radially as in @xcite or vertically .",
    "models similar to @xcite were developed by @xcite .    while these models were mostly concerned with the explanation of the observed spectra of the corresponding object",
    ", others considered the structural properties of these two - phase discs and the interactions between the phases .",
    "@xcite and @xcite present a two - phase accretion disc model where the two phases interact by compton cooling of the corona by soft photons and the disc and heating of the disc by illumination of the corona , respectively .",
    "they carry out a extensive parameter study of their model , and also include the effects of mass and energy loss to a wind .",
    "@xcite examine effects of thermal conduction on two - phase media .",

    "they find stability / instability strongly dependent on the assumed coronal heating mechanism . in a later paper",
    "they consider mass loss / gain of both phases due to thermal conduction for stationary accretion disc models following the considerations of @xcite",

    "his model is based on .",
    "he calculates the detailed structure of the transition layer between disc and corona for an one - temperature corona . in order to dissolve the disc",
    ", he needs a large evaporation rate which only can be achieved if the conductive length scale is larger than the radius , so that radial thermal conduction enters the problem .",
    "he gives caveats and questions to what extent this type of accretion flow can be represented in a 1d model .",
    "one important point in all two - phase models discussed above is how to determine the relative amounts of luminosity produced in each of the two phases .",
    "most authors simply introduce a parameter which predetermines the fraction of luminosity produced or or the fraction of accretion rate in each phase .",
    "@xcite assume viscous heating to operate in both the hot corona and cool disc .",
    "given their constraints on the scaleheight of both parts , they find that most of the heat is produced in the corona .",
    "some ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) constrain this important parameter through some boundary conditions at the interface between corona and disc .",
    "all of these models however assume a stationary accretion flow .",
    "it was realised fairly early that accretion in a standard optically thick disc around a black hole is viscously unstable at near - eddington accretion rates @xcite .",
    "then electron scattering renders the accretion flow unstable .",
    "@xcite discovered that in these circumstances the radial advection of energy can not be neglected .",
    "they dubbed such discs `` slim discs''and found that these instabilities are stabilised by radial advection of energy .",
    "the name comes from the fact that the ratio of disc scale - height to radial distance , @xmath0 , is close to unity ( thermal energy close to kinetic energy ) , so that the usual thin disc approximation is at best marginally applicable .",
    "these accretion flows are optically thick adafs ( advection dominated accretion flow ) .",
    "these flows are applicable to the high / soft state .",
    "a similar picture holds for optically thin accretion flows .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed an optically thin counterpart to the optically thick adaf .",
    "they consider an optically thin disc , i.e. corona , close to the black hole and an standard optically thick disc further out .",
    "their model is applicable to lower accretion rates or the so - called low / hard state .",
    "the exact transition rate from the optically thin adaf to the optically thick disc is not predicted by these models , but is determined to match the observations .",
    "many of the observed black hole accretion discs show state transitions , i.e. transitions from the high / soft to the low / hard state and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the spectrum changes from very soft and black - body dominated ( attributed to the disc ) to a hard , power law dominated spectrum ( attributed to the corona ) .",
    "these changes appear to reflect changes in the accretion rate and flow geometry as discussed by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the various physical concepts which are required in order to determine the time - dependence of such accretion flows .",
    "many of the physical properties of such flows are not well - defined and it is necessary to make many simplifying assumptions along the way .",
    "we shall need to consider three possible disc states , when the disc is a standard disc with little or no corona , when the disc has a sizeable corona , and when the disc evaporates altogether and there is only a corona present .",
    "we also need to determine how the accretion flow transitions from one of these states to another .",
    "for example , if the disc is truncated at low accretion rates and the inner flow is filled with a hot corona , then we need to determine the transition radius below which the disc can not exist any more .",
    "thus we need to introduce a time - dependent two - phase model for black hole accretion discs , where mass can be exchanged between the two phases owing to thermal conduction .    because the modelling of all these processes is computationally demanding ( apart from all the physical complications this comes about basically because we need to follow thermal timescales in the inner hot disc for several viscous timescales of the outer cool disc ) , we present here just one example of a time - dependent computation .",
    "we take as an initial condition a steady - state flow where the hot and optically thick corona sandwiches a cool and geometrically thin disc for which the accretion rates in each component are predetermined .",
    "this is similar to some of the models derived in the literature of the kind invoked to explain the spectral characteristics of these objects ( see above ) .",
    "we then fix the total accretion rate at the outer boundary and allow the disc to evolve , permitting radial viscous evolution of both the disc and coronal components , and well as thermal energy and mass flow between them .",
    "we give a detailed description of the physical assumptions we make to describe model in sect .",
    "[ sect : model ] .",
    "these assumptions of necessity over - simplify the problem and are certainly not unique .",
    "they should however give a reasonable indication of the sort of behaviour we might expect from such discs . in sect .",
    "[ sect : importance ] we discuss the relative contributions of the corona and disc to the total luminosity and we also briefly review some observational results .",

    "we assume that at a given radius the general accretion flow consists of an optically thick but geometrically thin accretion disc which is sandwiched by a hot geometrically thick and optically thin corona above and below . in the following we refer to these parts of the flow as disc and corona , respectively .",

    "the disc or the corona might cease to exist if either of them is evaporated , we discuss the treatment of these cases in section  [ sect : trunc ] .",
    "we model the disc as a standard accretion disc in the so - called one - zone approximation .",
    "hence the density @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 just represent some average values at a given radius @xmath3 . taking constant density ,",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium gives a pressure distribution of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the rotational frequency of the disc which we assume to be keplerian , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the pressure at a height @xmath8 above the midplane .",
    "the pressure in the midplane , which we also take to be the representative pressure for the disc , contains contributions of gas and radiation pressure , @xmath9 where we consider a fully ionised , solar metallicity gas .",
    "thus we set the mean molecular weight @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath12 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "when the disc is optically thick , the disc radiates as a black body and we can treat the radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation , i.e. we write for the one - sided radiative losses in the disc @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the rosseland mean of the opacity .",
    "we use the tabulated values of the opal opacity project@xcite for the solar composition of @xcite .",

    "the viscosity produces a torque @xmath24 which gives rise to viscous dissipation @xmath25 in both cases we made use of the fact that the disc rotates at the keplerian speed , i.e. @xmath26 .",

    "we assume a pure hydrogen plasma for the corona ( number density of electrons equals number density of protons ) .",
    "an extension to non - hydrogen plasmas involves factors of a few percent in  ( [ eq : eoscorona ] ) .",
    "given the other approximations made here , not least the simplification of the one - zone model , we can safely neglect these factors for the purposes of this paper .",
    "we use the same viscosity prescription in the corona as for the disc ( see eq .",

    "as long as @xmath43 does not greatly exceed unity , there are only factors of about two involved .",
    "they are however comparable to the likely errors we make in the vertical averaging and thus we neglect them .",

    "we take the rate as calculated by @xcite .    the electrons cool radiatively by bremsstrahlung and other cooling processes ( atomic line cooling etc . ) . while there are cooling rates for different metallicities and physical conditions available in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the field length formally goes to infinity , but then physically there is no mass flux due to conduction either .",
    "we are only interested in an average mass flux in the transition layer .",

    "hence our disc evaporation criterion approximately coincides with the point where the electron scattering optical depth of the disc , @xmath114 becomes lower than unity .",

    "in the course of this paper we simply assume that it can not exist and these parts of the accretion flow are completely filled with hot coronal gas .",
    "the truncation criterion used in this paper is somewhat unrealistic , since even long before the disc becomes optically thin to electron scattering , it is optically thin to absorption and then it can not thermalize internally produced or incoming radiation .",

    "`` dead '' disc cells do not have thermal conduction , produce no torque , are neither heated by the corona nor by viscous dissipation .",

    "the innermost cell of the outer disc is defined as the cell where most of the mass is evaporated in the corona .",
    "the outermost cell of the inner remnant disc still loses mass to the next `` dead cell '' for angular momentum conservation .",
    "if the surface density , i.e. mass , of the disc in this cell is sufficiently high , then the disc is reactivated again .",
    "as the surface area of the disc annuli increases proportionally to @xmath221 , the outwards advected mass hardly ever manages to reactivate a disc cell .",
    "this case does not occur in the model presented in this paper . if the corona did fully condense into the disc , then the corresponding torques and accretion rates in this parts of the corona decrease towards zero . if the scale - height of the corona shrinks below some limit ( physically we should take the point when the optical depth with respect to absorption becomes larger than unity ) , this part of the flow then is in a disc only state .",
    "mass and energy influx from either side into the corona is still allowed .",
    "the corona starts to exist again if the optical absorption depth of the corona has shrunk below a certain threshold .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we start with a stationary disc and corona extending over the total computational domain . to compute the initial disc and corona structure we neglect radial advection , and we take the fraction of accretion occurring in the corona as @xmath222 .",
    "initially ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap1 ] ) in the outer regions the disc begins to evaporate into the corona , whereas in the inner regions the corona begins to condense into the disc ( see panel 1 in fig .  [ fig : schemat ] ) .",
    "since the disc loses a lot of matter in the outer parts by evaporation into the corona , the corona temporarily starts to flow outwards ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap1]d ) .",
    "most of the matter is in the disc , and the corona is two - temperature inside a radius of @xmath223 .",
    "although the corona close to the black hole has got a very small surface density in the initial model , as the outer disc however evaporates mass into the corona , this matter is then transported inwards through the corona .",
    "further in , the coronal accretion rate decreases as part of the coronal matter condenses into the disc and fills up the corona to surface densities of about @xmath224 g @xmath225 .",
    "this process happens very quickly , i.e. on the viscous timescale of the corona .",
    "the increase in coronal mass in the inner regions leads to an increase in the coronal luminosity .",
    "the inner corona itself condenses into the disc and increases the disc surface density ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap1]b and  [ fig : schemap2]b ) .",
    "since most of the matter condenses very close to the actual transition radius between the evaporating disc and recondensing corona ( which starts at around @xmath226 and increases eventually to around @xmath227 ) , it takes about a viscous timescale of the disc at that radius to increase the surface density of the inner disc .",
    "this timescale is @xmath210 times longer compared to the viscous timescale of the corona .    at the transition radius ( where the flow changes from an evaporating disc to and recondensing corona ) , the disc starts to flow outwards ( see panel 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemat ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap2]d ) . the accretion flow in the disc",
    "is then divided into three zones . in the inner zone",
    "the disc is moving inwards , in the intermediate zone it is moving outwards , and all the accretion is carried by the corona . in the outer zone the disc is moving inwards . at the boundary of the intermediate and the outer zone , despite the fact that the disc flow is towards this radius , the surface density of the disc declines rapidly .",
    "this comes about because most of the mass flowing into this region from both sides is quickly evaporated into the corona .",
    "an empty ring , or gap , develops in the disc at this point .",
    "this gap consists of coronal gas only and is compton cooled by soft photons from both the outer and inner disc remnants .    once this gap has formed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap3 ] ) , the inner disc is accreted and the gap widens . a decline in the disc scale - height is already visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap2]c , but the truncation of the disc is fully evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap3 ] . the inner disc disperses .",
    "this state is shown schematically in panel 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig : schemat ] .",
    "most of the inner disc gets accreted while a small part flows outwards ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap3]d ) .",
    "the luminosity of the disc declines .",
    "eventually we are left with an accretion flow where the inner part consists of a corona only and the mass supply for this corona is produced by the outer remnant disc ( cf .",
    "panel 3 of fig .",
    "[ fig : schemat ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : schemap4 ] ) .",
    "we show the luminosity evolution of the corona and disc in fig .",
    "[ fig : acclum ] .",
    "initially , the luminosity of the corona increases very quickly ( caused as we described above by a filling of the inner parts of the corona on the short viscous timescale of the corona at the transition from the two- to a one - temperature plasma ) , but can not exceed the disc luminosity as long as a disc exists ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : importance ] ) . on the much longer , viscous timescale of the disc the disc luminosity increases ( causes by a steady increase of surface density of the inner disc ) , before the luminosity drops with the development of the gap .",
    "once the inner disc is completely accreted , the dominant part of the radiation comes from the hot corona .",
    "the disc becomes steady - state at this point , and no significant further evolution occurs .",
    "the results of these computations indicate that a disc around a 10 @xmath228 black hole , accreting at @xmath229 relaxes to a state in which the outer disc is a standard accretion disc with a small corona , but the inner regions ( @xmath230 ) consist of only hot coronal gas which has evaporated from the disc .",
    "these calculations basically agree with the results of who concluded that for a stationary disc there would be net condensation of the corona in the inner disc and net evaporation further out .",
    "this comes about for the following reasons .",
    "the calculation of the evaporation / condensation rate ( eq .  [ eq : evapcond ] ) shows that the sign of the term @xmath231 determines condensation and evaporation , while the @xmath232 term given its strong temperature dependence determines the magnitude of the condensation / evaporation .",
    "this strong temperature dependence also ensures that for the heating and cooling mechanisms considered in this paper the mass transfer rate mainly depends on the upper boundary of the integration , i.e. the coronal values for the temperature .    to get an idea what causes the evaporation / condensation in the two zones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemat ] we assume that the only heating is the @xmath233 heating ( [ eq : qplusc ] ) and compton cooling ( [ eq : comptcoolctl ] ) and bremsstrahlung are the only cooling mechanisms .    within the corona the system is usually in thermodynamical equilibrium or quickly relaxes back to equilibriumm ",
    "faster closer to the black hole than further out .    in the two - temperature plasma ( zone i ) compton cooling dominates .",
    "if we calculate the difference between volume heating and cooling , we get @xmath234 where we have neglected compton heating and the relativistic generalisation in ( [ eq : comptcoolctl ] ) . within the corona , this term is about zero ( assuming thermal equilibrium ) . to get the evaporation / condensation rate , we need to integrate the difference over the range of temperatures from the disc to the coronal values .",
    "if the corona is a two - temperature plasma , then the fraction @xmath235 is small , but the closer we get to the one - temperature plasma within the transition layer , the bigger it becomes .",
    "then the difference  ( [ eq : heatcool1 ] ) becomes increasingly negative .",
    "the corona condensates onto the disc .    in zone ii we have got",
    "a one - temperature plasma and bremsstrahlung dominates the cooling .",
    "we need to calculate ( for simplicity we use the classical bremsstrahlung result , i.e. @xmath236 ) @xmath237 where @xmath238 is an arbitrary constant of proportionality .",
    "while the difference is zero in the corona , the further down we integrate towards the disc temperature , the smaller gets @xmath239 and the larger the second term in the difference .",
    "cooling dominates heating in the transition layer and thus the corona condenses into the disc .",
    "this is in contrast with our results presented in section  [ sect : results ] .",
    "the outer parts of the disc evaporate because the outward advection in the initial phases of the disc evolution lead to a imbalance between heating and cooling .",
    "heating dominates there and hence the disc evaporates .",
    "we now discuss some of the additional physical processes which we have neglected here , but which will need to be taken into account if the model is to be developed further .",
    "further out other cooling mechanisms than compton cooling and bremsstrahlung will be more efficient and eventually lead to a condensation of the corona .",
    "we neglect atomic cooling and only allow for bremsstrahlung and compton cooling for both the corona and the transition layer .",
    "the temperature dependence of bremsstrahlung and compton cooling ensures that the evaporation / condensation rate ( cf .",
    "[ eq : evapcond ] ) only depends on the upper limits of the integral involved . if we needed to include cooling processes other than bremsstrahlung ( i.e. atomic cooling etc . ) , then the calculation of the evaporation / condensation rate would be much more difficult . in the transition",
    "layer the gas then can have a significant absorption optical depth which in turn leads to photoionisation processes and significant radiation pressure .",
    "photoionisation and radiation pressure also influence the corona if it starts to collapse and may lead to an outflow ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : windflow ] ) .",
    "the increase in cooling may also be responsible for changing the sign of @xmath240 from evaporation to condensation in the outer parts of the disc and thus will stop the transition radius to move outwards .    with the widening of the inner gap a lack of soft photons develops and the electron temperature reaches temperatures in excess of @xmath241 k.",
    "this invalidates our use of non - relativistic bremsstrahlung rates .",
    "however given the other underlying approximations in the model , the missing factors of a few should not influence the results too much . in a more realistic model",
    ", pair production will set in ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and help to cool the corona .",
    "pair production increases the electron scattering optical depth and thus also leads to a rise in the compton cooling rate .",
    "in fact , many , if not all observations of agn hint at the existence of a population of hot electrons in a very narrow range of electron temperatures ( about 100 kev , which corresponds to @xmath242 k ( for ngc 4151 , see * ? ? ?",
    "these authors deduce an optical depth for the corona of @xmath243 .",
    "this is much higher than the values encountered in the model presented in this paper .",
    "the study of these cases is very important but requires further work .",
    "we have neglected the possibility of a wind / outflow throughout these calculations .",
    "physically given the large ratio of @xmath0 for the corona , the corona is only marginally bound within the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "thus it may well be that mass , energy and angular momentum is carried away in an outflow , jet or wind .",
    "this might then eventually lead to a reduction of @xmath0 until a stable state is found .",
    "this would then be an additional cooling mechanism for the corona .",
    "observations of low - luminosity agn and x - ray binaries in their low / hard state indicate that they are dominated by large - scale outflows @xcite .",
    "these outflows can be driven magnetically ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or by radiation pressure as well ( cf . sect .",
    "[ sect : othercool ] ) .",
    "another important question to be answered is the production of the corona .",
    "our model presented in this paper shows that once we start with a tiny corona and consider thermal conduction , the corona is produced mainly from the outer optically thick disc .",
    "how the corona came into existence in the first place is not clear . as described in sect .",
    "[ sect : trunc ] , we have run simulations for a one - phase black hole accretion disc but allowing for the transition to an optically thin flow .",
    "the simulations are similar to the ones reported in @xcite , except that we now use a prescription by @xcite for the optically thick - thin transition .",
    "as reported before , we still find limit cycles for the same range of accretion rates . during the high-@xmath82 phase , where the inner accretion disc is depleted ,",
    "this part of the accretion flow becomes optically thin and the temperature rises to about @xmath242 k close to the black hole .",
    "this might be a promising mechanism to produce a corona and a possible explanation for the so - called very high ( vh ) or steep power law ( spl ) state in x - ray binaries .",
    "this optically thin coronal part ( being geometrically thick ) then can flow out-/inwards on top of the accretion disc .",
    "in the course of this paper , we neglect non - keplerian rotation for the corona .",
    "we here discuss some possible effects of the inclusion of non - keplerian rotation into the model .",
    "these could play an important role in determining energy dissipation and the redistribution of angular momentum ( i.e. accretion ) in the disc and the corona .",
    "it will be important to investigate the outcome of including these effects in future computations .",
    "since the corona is geometrically thick , radial pressure gradients lead to a deviation from pure keplerian rotation .",
    "corona and disc thus rotate at different speeds . at their boundary ( the transition layer )",
    "torques arise which lead to angular momentum exchange between the two phases .",
    "the work done by these torques leads to an additional heating of the corona , in particular the ions .",
    "further angular momentum exchange arises from the mass transfer due to thermal conduction as then both layer rotate on different speeds .",
    "we give here a rough calculation of the torques and dissipation rates which might arise from these processes and the effect of the extra torque on the accretion flow .",
    "the rotation frequency @xmath244 in the presence of a radial pressure gradient is given by @xmath245 where @xmath29 is the coronal density , @xmath246 the pressure and @xmath3 the radial distance from the black hole .",
    "we approximate the pressure gradient by @xmath247 with @xmath248 .",
    "since @xmath249 and @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the sound speed and @xmath137 is the scale - height of the corona , we get @xmath252 if @xmath253 , then for small @xmath254 we can write @xmath255 thus coronal and disc flow rotate at different speed .",
    "the differential rotation leads to a free energy per unit surface area of about @xmath256 we note that usually @xmath257 and thus @xmath258 .",
    "this energy is released on a multiple of the local dynamical timescale , i.e. we set @xmath259 where @xmath260 is a parameter and @xmath261 the dynamical timescale .",
    "the release of the free energy ( [ eq : free - e ] ) leads to an additional heating of the corona at a rate @xmath262 if we put  ( [ eq : deltaomega ] ) into the last equation , then we get @xmath263 the heating timescale for this process is @xmath264 thus the heating timescale is longer than the thermal timescale @xmath265 of the corona ( @xmath266 ) for @xmath267    the differential rotation leads to a torque which tries to speed up the corona and slow down the disc , i.e. the torque is @xmath268 if only the torques given in eqns .",
    "( [ eq : torquecorona ] ) and  ( [ eq : torquedisc ] ) would be at work in the corona and disc , respectively , then in a stationary keplerian disc ( neglecting mass exchange due to thermal conduction ) matter flows at a speed @xmath269 as long as @xmath270 decreases with increasing radial distance , i.e. @xmath271 , then matter always flows inwards as expected .",
    "if we include the effects of the extra torque  ( [ eq : torquediff ] ) , then the contribution to the speed of matter is @xmath272 for a near keplerian rotating flow we approximate @xmath273 and put in eq .",
    "( [ eq : torquediff ] ) to get @xmath274 and @xmath275 for corona and disc , respectively .",
    "the relative contribution to the inflow caused by the viscous torques are @xmath276 and @xmath277 thus for @xmath278 the corona starts to flow outwards and for @xmath279 the inflow speed of the disc is dominated by the extra torque .",
    "for a typical disc and corona , we have @xmath280 , @xmath42 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 , then we have    * an outflowing corona for @xmath284 * and an inflowing disc dominated by the extra torque for @xmath285 .",
    "* since we physically can not resolve timescales smaller than the dynamical timescale , i.e. @xmath286 , @xmath287 has to be smaller than @xmath288 for both effects to work .    if we include the effects of thermal conduction , then the limit on @xmath289 for the outflow of the corona decreases(increases ) if the disc evaporates(corona condenses ) , since then the mass exchange transfers angular momentum as well .",
    "if the disc evaporates ( @xmath290 ) , the corona yields angular momentum at a rate of @xmath291 .",
    "the extra torque can be produced by the poloidal component of the magnetic field , @xmath292 , in the disc which slightly overextends into the corona .",
    "the smaller speed transforms the poloidal field into an azimuthal field .",
    "it creates an twist leading to a azimuthal field of the order of @xmath293 after one orbit .",
    "thus the torque produce by this process can be expressed as @xmath294 we furthermore can assume that the poloidal magnetic field strength @xmath292 is essentially equal to the intrinsic disc magnetic field @xmath295 .",
    "thus we slightly underestimate @xmath295 .",
    "if we further use @xmath296 , then we can write for the torque in  ( [ eq : tmag ] ) @xmath297 for @xmath298 we get with eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaomega ] ) @xmath299 finally we can use @xmath300 and arrive at @xmath301 the comparison of  ( [ eq : tmag3 ] ) and  ( [ eq : torquediff ] ) allows to estimate @xmath289 .",
    "we get @xmath302 for typical values for the corona ( @xmath303 , @xmath304 ) and typical values for the disc ( @xmath305 and @xmath281 ) we get @xmath306 . for @xmath307",
    "this leads to @xmath308 . since we underestimate @xmath295 , another factor larger than unity applies to the result in  ( [ eq : fec ] ) .",
    "hence our estimate of @xmath289 given the physical picture of the magnetic torque discussed above is compatible with an outflowing corona .",
    "it however constrains @xmath289 to be not significantly larger than unity .",
    "note that the inclusion of thermal conduction introduces a non - constant accretion rate @xmath309 and @xmath310 for the corona and disc , respectively , even for the stationary case .",
    "then extra factors enter the estimations presented above .",
    "the physical process presented here might be responsible for driving a corona produced close to the black hole further outwards where it can be influence the spectrum and may condense into the disc ( cf . sect .",
    "[ sect : prodcor ] ) .",
    "we present time - dependent simulations for a two - phase accretion flow around a black hole .",
    "we start with a flow which initially consists of a cool and geometrically thin but optically thick accretion disc , sandwiched by a hot and geometrically thick but optically thin corona .",
    "we show that as the disc evolves , the disc - corona sandwich vanishes inside a certain radius . a gap in the disc develops and the inner disc is fully accreted . in the final state",
    ", we are left with a coronal hot inner flow and a disc - corona sandwich further out .",
    "the general behaviour of the disc as described in this paper is not completely unexpected , since there is mounting evidence that the accretion flow around black holes at low accretion rates is truncated inside some radius ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : importance ] ) . while we assume a stellar mass black hole of 10 solar masses , the result is likely also to apply to higher black hole masses , i.e. agn .",
    "the result is in support of the unified scenario of @xcite , where the optically thick disc is truncated below a certain radius for low accretion rates and only reaches the last stable orbit for higher accretion rates close to the eddington limit .    for our model",
    ", we tried to keep the number of assumptions as small and the physics as simple as possible .",
    "but clearly there are still areas for improvement which we discuss in section  [ sect : discussion ] and plan to include in the future work .",
    "the model presented here nevertheless gives an indication that the standard disc at low accretion rates can not exist close to the black hole .",
    "the physical reasons for this are discussed in section  [ sect : evapcrit ] .",
