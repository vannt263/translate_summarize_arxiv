    "@xcite the ground state properties of the metallic and semiconducting systems are normally described by considering local spin density approximation ( lsda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange correlation functional.@xcite the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems , are described by adding orbital dependent hartree - fock ( hf ) potential to the lsda / gga functional , which is known as a lsda+@xmath0/gga+@xmath0 approximation.@xcite in this approximation , one has to deal with the double counting ( dc ) of the interactions . in this situation",
    "the best way is to identify and subtract the mean - field - part of the hf potential .",
    "czy@xmath7yk and sawatzky have proposed a scheme that is applicable for the weakly correlated system , which is known as around mean field ( amf ) dc scheme.@xcite for strongly correlated systems , amf dc scheme may not be valid . in these systems , one can prefer the fully localized ( fl ) dc scheme , where the average effect for localized states is subtracted with integer occupation numbers.@xcite it is also well known that lsda+@xmath0 calculations often converge to the local minima and hence they may predict the wrong ground state of the system.@xcite in order to know the magnetic ground state of a system , one has to compare the energy of various spin configurations . if no constraint is applied to the moments of the magnetic ions , it has normally been seen that the magnetic moment ( mm ) inside the muffin - tin sphere of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) solutions is slightly different .",
    "in such a situation , a small change in mm may predict the wrong ground state of the system , where several kinds of competing interactions among various degrees of freedom are present .    from above discussions ,",

    "many groups proposed that the orbital ordering is the key factor responsible for low temperature structural transitions observed in these compounds.@xcite due to this structural transition , geometrical frustration gets relaxed and hence these compounds show magnetic transitions .",
    "however , the non - coincidence of the structural and magnetic transitions also suggest the presence of a certain degree of geometrical frustration in these compounds .",
    "the experimentally observed values of the magnetic moments are found to be much smaller than the expected value of 2 @xmath14 , which has been attributed either to the presence of the large but negative value of orbital momentum or to the presence of a certain degree of geometrical frustration.@xcite these discussions clearly show that the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds are decided by the complex interplay of the electron , lattice , spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",

    ", one may come to the conclusion that the fl dc scheme is not suitable for predicting the correct ground state of the compound .",
    "however , the careful analysis of the data suggests that the cause of this discrepancy lies in the unconstrained nature of the calculations , which is clear from the following discussion .",
    "the mm per v atom of fm ( m@xmath68 ) and afm(os1 ) ( m@xmath69 ) solutions for the fl dc scheme is shown in table i , for @xmath0=1 - 6 ev .",

    "the value of @xmath70 m is @xmath210.13 @xmath71@xmath72 , for @xmath223 ev . at this stage",
    ", one may conjecture that the observed extra mm per v atom in fm solution as compared to afm solution appears to responsible for making the total energy of the fm solution less than that of afm for @xmath0=1 - 3 ev .",

    "however , in spite of this discrepancy , the amf dc scheme seems to predict the correct afm ground state of the compound , as the energies of afm solutions are less than the fm solutions , where afm structure is the experimentally observed ground state of the compound .",
    "in order to verify the above conjecture , we have performed the constrained calculations , where the magnitude of the mm of each v atoms is kept same for every type of solutions as described in computation details section .",

    "the decrease in the @xmath70@xmath74 with increasing @xmath0 gives rise to more stability to the os2 as compared to os1 .",
    "thus , the present work shows the capability of both dc schemes , in predicting the experimentally observed afm ground state on invoking the constraint calculations .",
    "this work also suggests that for @xmath223 ev , afm(os1 ) is the ground state due to the existence of only one type of os1 solution in the afm phase , whose energy is less than the fm solution .",
    "however , for @xmath33 ev , afm(os2 ) is the true ground state of the system , as its energy is less than both afm(os1 ) and fm solutions . from the above discussion",

    "the @xmath23@xmath4-@xmath5@xmath23 shows non - monotonic behavior for both the dc schemes , where it first increases from @xmath20 0.19 to @xmath20 0.23 for @xmath0=1 - 3 ev and then decreases at @xmath0=4 ev . above @xmath0=4",

    "this figure suggests the stabilization of afm(os1 ) ground state for @xmath23@xmath4-@xmath5@xmath23 @xmath240.25 and for higher values , afm(os2 ) ground state is stabilized .",
    "the existence of two orbital solutions in afm phase for higher @xmath0 may not be surprising , as it is well known that the magnetic structure of strongly correlated electron system is decided by the orientation of the orbitals in the space .",
    "the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules deal with this particular aspect of the strongly correlated electron system .",
    "this is expected to occur because of the presence of various interactions , where the delicate balance of spin , orbital , charge and lattice degrees of freedom decides the electronic and magnetic properties of the compounds . at this stage , it is difficult to identify some parameters , which are responsible for the existence of two orbital solutions .",
    "however , one may get some insight by looking at the electron occupancies of @xmath11 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 orbitals along with the mm of the v atoms , as shown in table ii .",
    "first of all we consider os1 solution .",
    "it is evident from the table that the total number of @xmath11 electrons show small @xmath0 dependence within fl dc scheme , as its value decreases from 2.48 to 2.42 with increasing @xmath0 , whereas amf dc scheme do not provide any @xmath0 dependence to the total number of @xmath11 electrons .",

    "however , @xmath76 and @xmath77 electrons do not show much @xmath0 dependence within the amf dc scheme and hence mm remains almost the same , which is @xmath20 1.37 @xmath14 . for @xmath223 ev",
    ", the large value of mm is observed for both dc schemes . in os2 solution",
    ", the fl dc scheme shows a slight @xmath0 dependence to the total number of @xmath11 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 electrons , which leads to the increment of mm from 1.61 to 1.66 @xmath14 , when @xmath0 increases from 4 to 6 ev .",
    "the amf dc scheme does not show any @xmath0 dependence to the total number of @xmath11 electrons .",

    "the spin - orbit interaction is very effective for the large suppression of the mm , as shown by kato @xmath55 @xmath56.@xcite the effect of the spin - orbit interaction is not considered in the present work . on comparing the mm of both the solutions , one can find that the mm of os2 solution is always more than that of the os1 solution . as mentioned earlier in the manuscript",
    ", such a small difference in the mm of two solutions may lead to a difference in their energy .",
    "thus , at this stage one may attribute the negative value of @xmath61 in fig .",
    "5 to the higher value of mm for the os2 solution , that may further rise the doubt about afm(os2 ) , as a true ground state of the compound at higher @xmath0 .",
    "in order to address this doubt , we have carried out the constrained calculations , where the magnitude of mm of v atoms is kept same in both the cases .",
    "the results , thus obtained show that the energy of afm(os2 ) is always less than that of afm(os1 ) for all values of @xmath0 and for both the dc schemes .",
    "thus , this work clearly suggests that the afm(os2 ) is the true ground state of the compound , where anti - ferro oo corresponding to os2 solution stabilizes the afm order for @xmath33 ev .",
    "these results also suggest that the reason for the existence of two orbital solutions at higher @xmath0 appears to be due to the existence of two orbital states with respect to the afm ordering as explained above .",
    "finally , we discuss the dependence of the ground state insulating gap on various parameters studied here .",
    "both the dc schemes show similar @xmath0 dependence gaps in afm(os1 ) ground state . at @xmath0=1",
    "ev , the calculation gives metallic state . at @xmath0=2",
    "ev , a small gap of @xmath20 0.06 ev is opened up , which increases to @xmath20 0.09 ev at @xmath0=3 ev .",
    "it is important to note that the experimentally observed insulating gap of the compound is @xmath20 0.32 ev @xcite , which is much larger than the highest gap obtained in afm(os1 ) solution .",
    "thus afm(os1 ) does not appear to be the ground state of the compound , as the value of @xmath0 required to open up the experimental band gap will be higher than 3 ev . in the afm(os2 ) ground state , both the dc schemes show different @xmath0 dependence band gap . at @xmath0=4",
    "ev , fl dc scheme shows a band gap of @xmath20 0.36 ev , whereas amf dc scheme fails to create any hard gap . at @xmath0=5",
    "ev , the amf dc scheme creates a hard gap of @xmath20 0.51 ev , which increases to 0.93 ev at @xmath0=6 ev . the value of band gap within the fl dc scheme increases from @xmath20 0.96 to 1.5 ev , when the value of @xmath0 changes from 5 to 6 ev . on comparing the calculated band gap with the experimental one",
    ", we can conclude that the afm(os2 ) is the real ground state of the compound and the value of @xmath0 of this compound is expected to be @xmath20 4 ev .",
    "this value of @xmath0 appears to make sense in the light of the work of canosa _",
    "_ , where @xmath11 electrons of znv@xmath1o@xmath2 compound are put in the intermediate localization range.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have studied the applicability of the lsda+@xmath0 method in understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of a complex system , where several types of competing interactions among electron , spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom exist , by considering znv@xmath1o@xmath2 compound as a case study .",
    "our work clearly suggests that the unconstrained lsda+@xmath0 calculations are not the correct methods for predicting the exact electronic and magnetic ground states of such systems .",
    "it is suggested that the constrained lsda+@xmath0 calculations should be preferred , if one wants to predict the real magnetic ground state of an unknown complex system , as small change in the magnetic moments of magnetic atoms in various spin configurations may lead to the prediction of wrong ground state of the compound .",
    "the present study on znv@xmath1o@xmath2 compound shows the existence of only one type of orbital solution corresponding to ferromagnetic solution .",
    "however , in the antiferromagnetic phase , two kinds of orbital solutions afm(os1 ) and afm(os2 ) , exist for @xmath33 ev and only afm(os1 ) is found to exist for @xmath223 ev .",
    "the ground state solution of the compound changes from afm(os1 ) to afm(os2 ) with varying @xmath0 , which is related to the discontinuous change in the electronic occupancy difference of @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals ( @xmath23@xmath4-@xmath5@xmath23 ) .",
    "such change in the ground state occurs around @xmath0=3 ev .",
    "the detailed analysis of the @xmath0 dependent band gaps suggests that the afm(os2 ) is the true ground state of the compound .",
