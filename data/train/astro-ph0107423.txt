    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) models provide a solid framework capable to explain most of the properties of the universe at large scales . in the last few years a very large effort has been spent in the investigation of the detailed structure of the virialized haloes within the cdm scenario , in which dark particles are assumed to be cold and collisionless . using n - body simulations",
    "it was showed that virialized haloes are well described by an universal density profile , the navarro , frenk , @xmath1 white model ( 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) .",
    "this profile diverges at the center showing a cuspy core : @xmath2 .",
    "recent high - resolution n - body simulations show that as the numerical resolution is increased , the resulting dark density profile goes as @xmath3 ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . on galactic scales",
    "the theory seem to be in conflict with the observations , since the rotation curves of lsb and dwarf galaxies rise too slowly with respect to the predictions of the cdm model .",
    "indeed , the rotation curves of these galaxies call for a finite central density ( soft core ) , in conflict with the cuspy cores predicted by the model .",
    "note that lsb and dwarf galaxies are systems strongly dark matter dominated , so their rotation curves are good tracers of the underlying dark haloes gravitational potential and therefore good candidates to explore the innermost shape of the dark matter distribution .",
    "recently , however , some authors have challenged the existence of soft cores in centers of galaxies measuring h@xmath0 rotation curves of late - type dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "basically they find two results : hi rotation curves for most of the galaxies are affected by beam - smearing and a good agreement with concentration values predicted by the nfw model ( van den bosch and swaters 2000 ) .",
    "we have carried out h@xmath0 rotation curves at the tng of dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "the spatial resolution in the central regions is a factor 10 better than with respect the hi data published in literature for the same galaxies . in fig.1",
    "we reproduce the circular velocities for the galaxies ugc4325 , ugc11861 and f571 - 8 ( empty circles are our h@xmath0 observations and filled circles are hi data ) . from a comparison between optical and radio data it is interesting to note that hi observations for these galaxies are not affected ( or are very little ) by beam smearing ( see marchesini et al . at this conference , for details ) . to discriminate between the nfw and king models as representative profile of the primeval dark halo",
    ", we built a fiducial galaxy .",
    "the dotted lines in the top panels represent a nfw profile while the dotted lines in the bottom panels are due to a king profile .",
    "accounting for the disc formation ( dashed lines ) we computed next the adiabatic contraction of the dm component due to the cooling of the baryons into the virialized haloes . the final rotation curve",
    "is then obtained ( solid lines ) and compared with the h@xmath0 data .",
    "the final curve is best fitted for all galaxies assuming that the dark matter in the primeval halo is distribuited as a king profile . on galaxy cluster scale , there are at least two clusters with evidence of soft cores : cl0024 + 1654 as inferred by strong lensing technique ( tyson et al .",
    "1998 ) and a1705 as revealed by the chandra data ( ettori et al . at this conference ) .",
    "the central densities of the galaxies analyzed here or taken from the literature and of cl0024 + 1654 seem to confirm the evidence that the central density is independent on the halo mass ( firmani et al .",
    "future observations will increase the sample and put these observational findings on a more robust basis .",
    "-3.6truecm    -0.5truecm    -3.6truecm    -0.5truecm",
    "the question is : how can we justify the existence of soft cores in galaxies and in galaxy clusters ?",
    "warm dark matter ( wdm ) has been proposed in order to solve the conflict with cdm models . however , even if interesting , this scenario is unable to produce soft cores at galactic scales ( see e.g. avila - reese et al .",
    "a possible solution is to assume a weakly self - interacting cold dark matter ( sidm ) ( spergel @xmath1 steinhardt 2000 ) .",
    "it is well known that the nfw profile is far from thermal equilibrium , and shows , in fact , a inner positive temperture gradient .",
    "collisions between dark particles would modify the velocity distribution to a maxwellian distribution generating a constant velocity dispersion .",
    "we have developed different approaches to explore the sidm regime : thermodynamic ( firmani et al . 2000 ) and dynamic models building a cosmological boltzmann code ( firmani , donghia , @xmath1 chincarini 2000 , astro - ph/0010497 ) . here , we propose a new numerical procedure applied to n - body simulations ( donghia , firmani , @xmath1 chincarini 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "our technique is capable to simulate a single halo of any size and mass in a cosmological framework coupling semi - numerical technique and n - body simulations .",
    "the cosmological initial conditions are fixed by the mass aggregation history of the halo using semi - analytical models and only the dynamical evolution of the halo is followed by the n - body code . to achieve this , the hydra code has been ad hoc modified and our version can describe simulations both of collisional and collisionless dark haloes . in our simulations",
    "we assume a cross section inversely proportional to the particle velocity dispersion : @xmath4 @xmath5/gev with @xmath6 the halo velocity dispersion in units of 100 km / s .",
    "the top panels of fig . 2 show the dark density profiles of haloes of @xmath7 ( left panel ) and @xmath8 ( right panel ) as obtained in a sidm model .",
    "each halo have been modeled assuming the cross section value above ( in the figure the corresponding density profiles have empty circles ) and a cross section three times larger ( filled circles ) . in the same plot",
    "solid lines are the nfw profiles . within a hubble time",
    "a modest self - interaction cross section value creates soft cores in haloes of any size and a three times stronger cross section value produces larger soft cores .",
    "bottom panels of fig . 2 show the corresponding halo radial dispersion velocity profiles ( symbols have the same meanings as above ) . this is the case in which any trend towards the core collapse is avoided by the competition between a mass accretion determined by the halo merging history and a thermalization process by collisions .",
    "-0.3truecm h@xmath0 rotation curves carried out at tng of two late - type dwarf galaxies and one lsb galaxy show evidence of soft cores as the mass distribution of cl0024 + 1654 on galaxy cluster scales . integrating the information from galaxies to clusters of galaxies the halo central density seems to be independent of the halo mass .",
    "wdm in unable to produce visible soft cores , but sidm in a _ very weak _ self - interacting regime ( @xmath4 @xmath5/gev ) produces soft cores in agreement with the available observations on different scales .",
