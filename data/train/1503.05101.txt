    "in  @xcite , berry conjectures that there should be complex - valued eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in @xmath1 whose nodal set @xmath2 has knotted connected components , and raises the question of whether there can be eigenfunctions of a quantum system whose nodal set has components with higher order linking , as in the case of the borromean rings , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "furthermore , berry remarks that it should be possible to construct these sets so that they are _ structurally stable _ in the sense that any small enough perturbation of the corresponding eigenfunction ( in the @xmath3 norm with @xmath4 ) still has connected components in the nodal set that are diffeomorphic to the knot or link under consideration .    as a side remark ,",
    "let us recall  @xcite that a physical motivation to study the nodal set of a quantum system is that it is the locus of destructive interference of the wave function .",
    "it is related to the existence of singularities ( often called dislocations ) of the phase @xmath5 and of vortices in the current field @xmath6 .",
    "the existence of knotted structures of this type , especially in optics and in fluid mechanics , has recently attracted considerable attention , both from the theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite viewpoints .",
    "the main result of this paper solves these problems of berry by showing that any finite link can be realized as a collection of connected components of the nodal set of a high - energy eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator , and that the link is structurally stable in the same sense as above .",
    "specifically , we have the following    [ t.main ] let @xmath0 be any finite link in @xmath1",
    ". then one can deform it with a diffeomorphism @xmath7 of @xmath1 so that @xmath8 is the union of connected components of the nodal set @xmath2 , where @xmath9 is a complex - valued eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator in @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the link @xmath8 is structurally stable for the function  @xmath9 .",
    "we recall that the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator are the square - integrable functions @xmath9 satisfying the equation @xmath10 in @xmath1 .",
    "it is well - known that the eigenvalues are of the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 a nonnegative integer , and that the degeneracy of the corresponding eigenspace is @xmath13 .",
    "the key idea of the proof of theorem  [ t.main ] is that , using techniques introduced in  @xcite , one can prove that there are complex - valued solutions to the helmholtz equation @xmath14 in @xmath1 , such that the link @xmath0 is a union of connected components of the nodal set @xmath15 , up to a diffeomorphism .",
    "this is pertinent to the study of the eigenvalues of the harmonic oscillator because , in balls of radius @xmath16 , the high - energy asymptotics of the eigenfunctions are determined by the helmholtz equation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "heuristically , one can understand why this is true by introducing the rescaled variable @xmath17 , in terms of which eq .",
    "is read as @xmath18 the way to make this precise is by computing the high - order asymptotics of the laguerre polynomials , which govern the radial part of the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "going over the fine details we will see that the accidental degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the harmonic oscillator is an essential ingredient of the proof too , essentially because it ensures the existence of families of isoenergetic eigenfunctions with a rich behavior in the angular variables .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t.main ] is given in section  [ s.main ] , although the proofs of two technical lemmas are relegated to sections  [ s.lemma1 ] and  [ s.lemma2 ] .",

    "let us begin by fixing an orthogonal basis of eigenfunctions associated with the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , we will take @xmath19 where @xmath20 are spherical coordinates and we are using the standard notation for the laguerre polynomials and the spherical harmonics . here the indices of the eigenfunctions range over the set @xmath21 and the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath22 is @xmath23 notice that the eigenvalue is independent of  @xmath24 .",
