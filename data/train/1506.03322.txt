    "at low temperatures , the longitudinal resistivity of metallic systems exhibits quantum oscillations when submitted to a sufficiently high magnetic field .",
    "these so - called shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations are , in particular , characteristic of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) confined in semiconducting structures and appear at low magnetic fields prior to the development of the quantum hall effect in clean systems .",
    "the analysis of the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the sdh oscillations @xcite provides a valuable information on the quantized density of states ( e.g. the landau level shape,@xcite and the cyclotron and spin gaps @xcite as well as on the nature of the carrier scattering @xcite and the associated quantum life times .@xcite while the most detailed studies were historically undertaken in high mobility gaas - based 2deg , other 2d systems of high quality have slowly emerged , enabling us to explore the influence of different parameters such as the valley @xcite and spin degrees of freedom , @xcite as well as the effect of magnetism in these systems .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we present an investigation of the sdh oscillations in a high quality `` magnetic 2deg '' in a diluted magnetic semicondutor , cdmnte .",
    "@xcite cdmnte is grown by substituting a small fraction of cd atoms by mn in the original ( non - magnetic ) cdte ii - vi semiconductor .",
    "the high quality of these systems was recently demonstrated by the observation of the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite a systematic comparison of the sdh oscillations in both systems is made here to identify the particular effects related to the presence of magnetic mn ions .",
    "the sdh oscillations in cdte exhibits a behavior similar to the widely studied gaas - based 2deg ; a field / temperature independent landau level broadening characteristic of long range scattering mechanism , and an exchange - enhanced spin gap leading to spin - split oscillations ( a doubling of the frequency ) above a critical magnetic field . in cdmnte , the sdh oscillation exhibit an additional beating pattern with nodes where the oscillations have a vanishing amplitude .",
    "we show that this behavior is a consequence of the giant giant zeeman splitting ( gzs ) resulting from the @xmath0 exchange interaction between electrons and the @xmath1 mn spins .",
    "@xcite the sdh characteristics can be well - described by incorporating the electron - mn exchange interaction into the traditional lifshitz - kosevich formalism .",
    "@xcite for a good quantitative description , the formation of mn pair clusters with direct mn - mn antiferromagnetic interactions , which reduce the average mn spin polarization , has to be considered .",
    "another peculiarity of the magnetic 2deg is a decrease of the landau level broadening with increasing temperature , together with an increase in the broadening with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this suggests a connection between the landau level broadening and the mn spin polarization , as expected in the presence of local fluctuation in the mn concentration .",

    "the laser illumination was limited to @xmath13  @xmath14w/@xmath15 but permanently maintained as it was found to assure the most stable conditions over the different experimental runs ( the resulting heating effects on the 2deg were estimated directly from the magneto - resistance ) .",

    ", the sdh amplitude tends to zero in the region of the nodes , while at higher fields , they are characterized by a local minimum of the sdh amplitude associated with a doubled sdh oscillation frequency .",
    "the presence of a strong electron - manganese exchange interaction gives rise to a giant zeeman splitting ( gzs ) in the 2deg , which grows quickly as the localized mn spins are polarized by the applied magnetic field .",
    "the gzs saturates when the mn spin polarization has reached its maximum value , for a magnetic field of typically @xmath38  t at low temperatures .",
    "this `` brillouin - like '' strong field dependence of the gzs , compared to the smaller linear increase of the cyclotron gap ( @xmath39  mev / t ) , leads to the rather unusual situation where the spin gap @xmath40 can be several times larger than the cyclotron gap . as the magnetic field increases , the conditions @xmath41 , where @xmath28 is a ( decreasing ) integer , are successively satisfied .",
    "these magnetic field - dependent commensurability of the spin and cyclotron gaps leads to a maximized density of states when the fermi level lies in the center of coinciding ( degenerate ) levels .",
    "when the spin - resolved landau levels are all equally - spaced ( @xmath27 ) , the maximum density of states is a factor of two smaller .",
    "the observed sdh beating are therefore a direct manifestation of the gzs in magnetic 2degs .",
    "we note that the `` nodes '' conditions(@xmath27 ) should also be accompanied by a doubling of the sdh frequency , similar to the one observed at high enough magnetic fields in cdte ( fig .",

    "[ fig1 ]  ( b ) . in the lower magnetic field regime , where @xmath42 , the density of state modulation is so small that the nodes conditions result in a disappearance of the sdh .",
    "in order to quantitatively describe the data in both cdte and cdmnte , we have derived the formula describing the sdh oscillation in the case of an arbitrarily large spin splitting @xmath40 . we have used the kubo - greenwood expression  @xcite @xmath43 to calculate the conductivity @xmath44 of electrons , where @xmath45 is the fermi - dirac distribution .",

    "the effective carrier concentration @xmath49 is proportional to the density of states at fermi level @xmath53 and can be written as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the zero - field density of states and @xmath56 is the modulation of @xmath57 for @xmath58  t ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .    the relative change of the conductivity can then be written as @xmath61 where the exponent @xmath62 depends on the type of scattering ( @xmath63 for long - range scattering and @xmath64 for short range scattering where @xmath65 .",

    "is directly taken into account by using the third ( `` cluster '' ) term of eq.[equspinsplitting ] . in this term , the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) af interaction is expected to be rather strong ( @xmath111k @xcite ) , such that for magnetic fields lower than 5  t(=@xmath112 , where @xmath113  mk ) , nn are always anti - ferromagnetically coupled and thus do not contribute to the gzs .",

    "this is usually explained in terms of non - homogeneous distribution of mn.@xcite the value of @xmath119k suggests that the influence of the mn pair clusters originates from the next nearest neighbors ( nnn ) interaction of manganese ions .",
    "the small but non - zero value observed for @xmath121mk can be attributed to higher order af interactions .    as a conclusion ,",
    "the beating pattern of the sdh oscillations is profoundly modified by the magnetic sub - system , and therefore constitutes a powerful tool to characterize the e - mn interaction , the mn concentration , as well as the mn - mn interactions in cdmnte systems .      in fig .",

    ", width=321 ]    in addition to the previously analyzed beating patterns , which manifest themselves as repeated deviations from the solid black line , we observe that the overall envelope of the amplitude of the oscillations depends only weakly on temperature .",
    "this is particularly evident when comparing the almost parallel solid black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] to the case of cdte ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) where the @xmath123 slope of the oscillation amplitude is strongly increasing with temperature , a usual consequence of the sdh temperature damping .",
    "this suggests that the usual sdh temperature damping , described by the `` @xmath124 '' function in eq .",
    "( [ equsdh ] ) , is compensated by some non - trivial temperature dependence of the disorder damping ( exponential term in eq .",
    "( [ equsdh ] ) . more precisely , the observed behavior points toward an unusual temperature narrowing of the ll broadening ( at thus a reduced `` disorder damping '' at higher temperature ) which can not be anticipated within the most standard forms of scattering .",
    "another interesting observation is the non - linearity of the overall envelope in the @xmath123 scale , which is indicated at low temperature by the red line in fig .",
    "this @xmath123 non - linearity implies a magnetic field dependence of the landau level broadening @xmath68 .",
    "we note that the value of quantum lifetimes in cdte and cdmnte are here very similar , in agreement with the previous observations .",
    "@xcite however , the observed field and temperature dependence of this quantity in cdmnte points out to the occurrence of additional physical effect contributing to the level broadening .",
    "again , the main difference between cdte and cdmnte qws is the presence of manganese spins . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the observed dependence of the broadening are qualitatively reminiscent of the behavior of the average manganese spin polarization @xmath125 , which increase ( decreases ) with the magnetic field ( temperature ) , as can be seen by considering the ( dominant ) brillouin function in eq .",
    "( [ equspinsplitting ] ) . as the spin polarization of the manganese system directly determines the position of the landau level , a _ variation _ of the manganese content @xmath126 which appears in the pre - factor @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ equspinsplitting ] ) will shift the energy level position proportionally to @xmath125 .",
    "a non - homogenous mn distribution at the local scale is therefore at the origin of an additional level broadening .",

    "the data were fitted using @xmath135ev and @xmath136% which gives an estimation for the relative mean fluctuation of the mn concentration .",
    "this value is in good agreement with expected statistical fluctuation of number of manganese ions @xmath137 per one electron ( or per area defined by de broglie wavelength ) . in our sample @xmath138 , giving fluctuations @xmath139 .",
    "the resulting total ll broadening @xmath68 is plotted as a function of magnetic field and temperature in the inset of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the extracted `` non - magnetic '' broadening @xmath133 is smaller in cdmnte than in cdte .",
    "this is actually not surprising , because our approach considers an _ additional _ source of broadening in cdmnte while the total broadening are similar in both systems .",
    "physically , a smaller @xmath133 broadening in cdmnte could be attributed to a reduction of the intra - landau level spin - flip scattering in cdmnte . indeed , while the opposite spin levels in cdte always belong to the same landau level , in cdmnte the gzs puts into coincidence opposite spins with different orbital quantum number which might affect the spin - flip scattering processes .",
    "we finally note that the value of @xmath140% is obtained by assuming that the temperature / field dependent landau level broadening originates _ only _ from fluctuation in the manganese concentration , and thus constitutes an upper bound for the mean fluctuations .",
