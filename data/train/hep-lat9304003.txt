    "the effort toward construction of chiral gauge theories on the lattice is primarily motivated by the fact that a full nonperturbative understanding of the standard su(2 ) @xmath0 u(1)@xmath1 electroweak theory is required to answer a variety of unsolved questions such as the upper bound of the higgs boson and fermion masses in the full theory and the magnitude of the baryon number violation in the standard model .",
    "the lattice approach provides a potentially useful tool for these purposes .",
    "however , there is a serious difficulty in this approach : because of fermion doubling@xcite , each lattice fermion field yields 16 fermion modes , half of which has one chirality and the other half the opposite chirality , so that the lattice theory is non - chiral .",
    "there are several attempts to avoid this difficulty . among the proposals , the wilson - yukawa formulation @xcite has been extensively investigated during the last few years . in particular it has been found through numerical studies@xcite and analytical work@xcite that the fermion doublers decouple in the continuum limit if the wilson - yukawa coupling is sufficiently large .",
    "recently it has been reported@xcite in a quenched simulation of a @xmath2 chiral model that the charged fermion mass is approximately equal to the sum of the neutral fermion mass and the scalar boson mass on a @xmath3 lattice .",
    "this relation suggests that the charged state is a scattering state of the neutral fermion and the scalar boson , and is not a bound state .",
    "based on this interpretation it was claimed that charged fermion states do not exist in the symmetric phase of the global chiral model for strong wilson - yukawa coupling , and hence the wilson - yukawa formulation fails .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a large finite size effect is seen in the data of ref.@xcite for charged fermion propagators between @xmath4 and @xmath3 lattices and that the relation among the masses does not hold on an @xmath4 lattice",
    ". thus much further analysis of the model , especially a systematic study of finite size effect , is needed to see if the conclusion is tenable .",
    "we have carried out such an analysis and we report on the results in this article .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we define the action of the @xmath2 chiral model we study and consider several bosonic and fermionic field operators , especially the two kinds of dirac fermions , neutral and charged .",
    "we measure two - point correlation functions of these operators in the simulation whose parameters are also summarized . in sect.3 spectra in the broken phase are investigated .",
    "we extract masses of neutral and charged fermions as well as those of scalar particles .",
    "in sect.4 we present and discuss the results of our monte carlo simulation in the symmetric phase in detail .",
    "emphasis is placed on the fermionic charged state , which has been argued not to exist as a single particle in this phase@xcite .",
    "finite size effects for the charged fermion state are examined by means of the large wilson - yukawa coupling expansion .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect.5 .",
    "we investigate a chiral u(1 ) higgs - fermion system in the wilson - yukawa formulation with the action given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is a non - linear u(1 ) scalar field satisfying @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the hopping parameter of the boson , the yukawa coupling constant , and the wilson - yukawa coupling constant respectively . the phase transition between the broken phase and the symmetric phase occurs at @xmath10 in the quenched theory .",
    "the action @xmath11 is invariant under a global @xmath12 transformation given by @xmath13 { } \\omega_{l , r } \\in { \\rm u(1)_{l , r } } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\psi_n   & \\rightarrow & ( \\omega_l p_l + \\omega_r p_r)\\psi_n , \\nonumber\\\\   \\bar   \\psi_n   & \\rightarrow   & \\bar \\psi_n ( \\omega_l ^\\dagger p_r + \\omega_r ^\\dagger p_l ) . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the scalar field @xmath14 and the _ chiral _ fermion fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 are assigned the charges @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",

    "the fermion fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 are usually called `` neutral '' and `` charged '' in view of the eventual gauging of the global @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "this distinction is not important since @xmath25 will be the `` charged '' fermion if the @xmath26 symmetry is gauged .",
    "the most important distinction between @xmath25 and @xmath27 is that the wilson - yukawa coupling is reduced to an ordinary wilson term and the yukawa coupling to a mass term for the neutral fermion @xmath25 .",
    "in fact one easily sees that @xmath28 furthermore , the right - handed component of the neutral fermion has the shift symmetry@xcite .",
    "consequently , it is expected to appear as a massless particle at the point @xmath29 .",
    "it has been shown ( @xcite@xcite ) that the physical fermion state of the @xmath25 field appears in the continuum limit while doublers of the @xmath25 are decoupled when the wilson - yukawa coupling @xmath9 is large enough ( @xmath30  ) .    in terms of the charged fermion , on the other hand",
    ", the action is written as @xmath31 since @xmath30 is needed for the doublers to decouple , the field @xmath27 interacts strongly with the scalar field through the wilson - yukawa coupling .",
    "we investigate this strongly coupled system through the monte carlo simulation .      in order to extract the properties of the scalar state of the model , we consider three different correlation functions at zero spatial momentum defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 means the connected part of correlation functions .    in the symmetric phase ( at @xmath36 in the quenched approximation )",

    ", each scalar field configuration is rotated globally so that it satisfies @xmath48 .",
    "consequently @xmath49 and the massive @xmath50 propagator can be fitted by the same form as before .",

    "the doubler propagator is fitted with the first term in ( [ eqn : neut - ansat ] ) because its `` time doubler '' is much heavier .",
    "we will also compare data to the semi - analytical prediction ( [ eqn : neut - ansat ] ) with the monte carlo estimation of @xmath73 as an input .",
    "for the charged fermion , the form of the propagator is not known .",
    "we found that the formula ( [ eqn : neut - ansat ] ) does not fit the charged fermion propagator well .",
    "we therefore tried a single pole form@xcite for the fit given by @xmath74 we extract the mass @xmath75 using the data over a time interval @xmath76 varing @xmath77 in order to see whether the mass is stable .",

    "see table [ table : scal - sim ] for statistics .",
    "the fermion propagators are calculated by the conjugate gradient method with the point - source in the broken phase and the wall - source in the symmetric phase . the anti - periodic ( periodic ) boundary condition in the time direction ( the spatial directions ) is used .",

    "this also can be seen from the following equation @xmath97 we fit the neutral fermion propagator with ( [ eqn : neut - ansat ] ) and the charged fermion propagator with ( [ eqn : char - ansat ] ) .",

    "( the relation @xmath99 in the broken phase has been also observed in ref.@xcite using the momentum space propagators . )",

    "we have checked that these values are insensitive to the fitting range .",
    "our value @xmath103 on an @xmath4 lattice obtained with the metropolis algorithm is substantially larger than the value quoted in ref.@xcite using([eqn : scal - ansat - sigma ] ) ] @xmath104 of ref.@xcite , which employed the cluster algorithm@xcite . in order to make a direct comparison we generated 120,000 configurations with the same cluster algorithm and found @xmath105 on an @xmath4 lattice , which perfectly agrees with our metropolis value quoted above .",
    "thus the discrepancy is not caused by a different choice of the algorithm .",
    "for those who may be interested in resolving this problem , we provide our data of @xmath102 in table [ table : scal - prop - symm ] .",
    "the calculation of the neutral fermion propagator has been performed with the parameters in table [ table : fermi - sim ] .",

    "we have therefore tried to extract the mass through a fit of the form ( [ eqn : char - ansat ] ) over the range @xmath108 .",
    "the value of @xmath75 as a function of @xmath77 is plotted in fig.[figure : char - stabl ] .",
    "since the value of @xmath75 significantly changes with the variation of @xmath77 , the charged fermion mass can not be extracted reliably by the fit .",
    "we are therefore not able to confirm the relation claimed in ref.@xcite that @xmath109 on a @xmath3 lattice",
    ". we should comment that our propagator numerically differs from that of ref.@xcite by 3 to 5 standard deviations , exhibiting a faster decrease with @xmath110 .",
    "( see fig.[figure : char - bds ] . )",
    "our data of @xmath107 for both sizes are given in table [ table : scal - prop - symm ] .",
    "the discrepancy probably originates from the difference of the scalar field configurations noted before .      in order to understand the nature of the charged fermion state",
    ", we have to find a good explanation for both the @xmath110 dependence of the rest energy @xmath111 and the large finite size effect of the propagator .",
    "it has been reported in ref.@xcite that the large wilson - yukawa coupling expansion explains the data of ref.@xcite . however , the agreement is only qualitative .",
    "in addition our charged fermion propagator is different from that of ref.@xcite and their results for the scalar mass and the wave function renormalization constant , which were used in the calculation of ref.@xcite as an input , are also different from ours .",
    "furthermore the large finite size effect of the charged fermion propagator was not discussed in terms of the large wilson - yukawa coupling expansion in ref.@xcite .",
    "we therefore think that a reanalysis of our data in terms of the large wilson - yukawa coupling expansion is neccesary .",
    "we have performed the expansion for the charged fermion propagator up to the next - to - leading order as in ref.@xcite . to this order",
    "the analytic expression for @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the expansion parameter and @xmath115 .",
    "the leading order contribution @xmath116 is the convolution of the neutral fermion propagator @xmath117 and the scalar propagator @xmath118 the boundary conditions in the time direction imply @xmath119 for the fermion field and @xmath120 for the scalar field , where @xmath121 . in ( [ eqn:1w ] ) , @xmath122 is the left - handed part of the 4-point - vertex contribution given by @xmath123 with @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the bosonic 4-point green s function .",
    "following ref.@xcite we take the mean - field result for @xmath126 .",
    "similar formulae can be obtained for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "see ref.@xcite for details .    in order to compute the right handed side of ( [ eqn:1w ] ) we use the values of @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath73",
    "determined in our numerical simulation results for @xmath107 and the simulation data for the two lattices are compared in fig.[figure : char-1w ] for @xmath131 and in fig.[figure : char-1w-0.1 ] for @xmath132 .",
    "the agreement between the data and the prediction is excellent at @xmath131 and is very good even at @xmath132 .",
    "the leading order contribution to @xmath107 is the convolution of the neutral fermion propagator and the scalar propagator , each of which has very small lattice size dependence .",
    "it turns out , however , that their convolution has a large size dependence , which explains the size effect in our data .",
    "the next - to - leading order correction is found to be relatively small .",
    "the analytic predictions for @xmath127 and @xmath128 also agree with the data very well .",
    "( see fig.[figure : char-1w - sr ] and fig.[figure : char-1w - sm ] ) .    as a further check",
    ", we have performed the large wilson - yukawa coupling expansion of the charged fermion propagator in the broken phase . in this case",
    "the disconnected part has to be separated out from the two - point function of the scalar field , and the connected part is the sum of contributions from the massless nambu - goldstone boson and the massive real scalar particle .",
    "therefore , we should add the following contribution @xmath133 to ( [ eqn:1w ] ) and replace the scalar propagator @xmath134 with the sum of those for the nambu - goldstone boson and for the real scalar particle : @xmath135 here @xmath136 means that @xmath137 is omitted in the sum for @xmath138 .",
    "the results up to the next - to - leading order are plotted in fig.[figure : char-1w - bro ] .",
    "the expansion works well also in the broken phase .    within the large wilson - yukawa coupling expansion it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the charged fermion is a scattering state of the scalar particle and the neutral fermion . the good agreement between the data and the result of",
    "the expansion therefore provides strong evidence that no charged fermion exists as a single particle state in the symmetric phase .",
    "we have investigated the spectrum of fermions in the wilson - yukawa formulation through a quenched simulation of the u(1 ) chiral wilson - yukawa model . in the broken phase the neutral fermion state exists and the charged fermion operator generates the same state . in the symmetric phase",
    "the charged fermion mass can not be extracted by a single hyperbolic cosine fit even at large @xmath110 and charged fermion propagators suffer a large finite size effect .",
    "we found that not only this large finite size effect but also the form of charged fermion propagators can be explained by the large wilson - yukawa coupling expansion . within the expansion",
    "the charged fermion in the symmetric phase is interpreted as a scattering state of the scalar boson and the neutral fermion .",
    "we conclude that no charged fermion exists as a single particle asymptotic state in the wilson - yukawa model in _ both _ phases .",
    "only the scalar boson and the `` neutral '' dirac fermion exist in this model .",
    "although our data differ from those of ref.@xcite and our reasoning which leads to our conclusion is quite different , we agree on the nature of the charged fermion state in the wilson - yukawa formulation .    we can generalize this conclusion as follows . in more complicated chiral models with the wilson - yukawa coupling",
    ", we can always redefine fermionic field variables so that the wilson - yukawa coupling turns into a free wilson mass term .",
    "only those states generated by such field variables can appear as fermionic single particle states in the strong wilson - yukawa coupling region . and these states are necessarily dirac fermions with vector - like global charges .",
