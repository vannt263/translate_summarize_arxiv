    "supersymmetry is a well - motivated solution to the gauge hierarchy problem  @xcite . within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model  ( sm ) , the mssm , it is remarkable that one also finds an excellent unification of gauge couplings , a candidate for the dark matter , and the potential to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",

    ", it can only do so within a specific and tightly constrained region of the mssm parameter space .",
    "successful ewbg requires a significant new source of cp violation beyond the ckm phase of the sm  @xcite , and a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition  @xcite .",

    "new sources of cp violation are strongly constrained by searches for permanent electric dipole moments  ( edms ) of atoms , neutrons , and electrons  @xcite .",
    "mssm ewbg requires a significant phase in a light electroweak gaugino - higgsino ( chargino and neutralino ) sector  @xcite .",
    "such phases induce edms at one - loop order through quantum corrections involving first- and second - generation squarks and sleptons  @xcite .",
    "to avoid the experimental bounds on permanent edms , these sfermions must be heavier than about @xmath4  @xcite . at two - loop order there arise quantum corrections involving charginos and higgs bosons that can not be decoupled in this way  @xcite , further constraining the allowed mssm parameter space  @xcite .",
    "successful ewbg also requires a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "this can be achieved within the mssm if the lightest higgs boson is sm - like , and one of the scalar top quarks ( stops ) is very light  @xcite .",
    "precision electroweak constraints force the light stop to be mostly right - handed . on the other hand",
    ", the lep - ii bound on the light sm - like higgs boson mass of @xmath5  @xcite implies that the second mostly left - handed stop must be much heavier .",
    "a recent re - analysis of the electroweak phase transition within the mssm indicates that the acceptable stop and higgs sector parameters lie within the ranges  @xcite    cc ( -150)^2 m__r^2 -(50)^2 , &   0|a_t - |/m_q_3 0.7 , +  m_q_3 ^ 2(6)^2 , &   515 .",
    "the tachyonic right - handed stop mass implies that the lightest stop mass eigenstate is lighter than the top quark .",
    "it also implies that the standard electroweak vacuum is only metastable against decay to a deeper colour - breaking vacuum , but this is acceptable provided the electroweak vacuum forms first and is sufficiently long - lived  @xcite . in the region",
    "consistent with viable ewbg , the light stop mass as well as the light higgs boson mass are both found to lie below @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "together , the dual requirements of new cp - violation and a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition largely fix the mssm super particle spectrum : all sfermions other than the mostly right - handed stop ( and possibly a right - handed sbottom ) must be very heavy , while the electroweak gauginos and higgsinos must remain relatively light .",

    ", a light mostly - right - handed stop is difficult to probe at the lhc .",
    "direct searches for a light stop at the tevatron require this state to be relatively degenerate with the lightest supersymmetric particle  ( lsp ) or to decay primarily into three- or four - body modes  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a light stop that is nearly degenerate with a mostly - bino neutralino lsp can lead to an acceptable thermal relic density through co - annihilation between these states  @xcite .",

    "@xcite proposed a search for stops in association with a hard photon or a gluon jet .",
    "the additional tag provides a trigger which can be combined with a cut on missing @xmath8 in the event to provide a viable mono - jet or mono - photon signature of the light stop when it is nearly degenerate with the lsp  @xcite . with a very small mass difference between the stop and a neutralino lsp , the flavour - violating decay mode @xmath9 can lead to a displaced vertex in the context of minimal flavour violation  @xcite .",
    "light stops can also form stoponium , which may potentially be detected through its decays to diphotons  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we show that the light stop required for ewbg in the mssm leads to significant modifications of the production and decay rates of the higgs boson relative to the sm .",

    "the light stop required for electroweak baryogenesis is unique in that it pushes these effects to their limits . on account of the large hierarchy between the masses of the heavy sfermions and the light stop implied by mssm ewbg , we make use of an effective theory in which the heavy states are integrated out explicitly to compute the low - energy higgs - stop couplings  @xcite . the changes in the properties of the higgs boson induced by the light stop",
    "are directly related to the effects of the light stop on the electroweak phase transition .",
    "a measurement of these shifts at the lhc ( and other colliders ) would therefore provide direct information about the nature of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the outline of this papers is as follows . in section  [ rates ]",
    "we compute the effects of a light stop on higgs boson production and decay in the context of mssm ewbg .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for higgs boson searches at the tevatron and lhc in section  [ coll ] .",
    "section  [ concl ] is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "some additional discussion of parameter dependences is collected in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "the dominant higgs boson production mode at the tevatron and the lhc is gluon fusion , @xmath10  @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "this process is dominated by a top quark loop . if the sm is extended to include new coloured particles coupling to the higgs boson , such as stops in supersymmetry , they too will run in loops and contribute to the amplitude for this process .",
    "the interference with the top can be constructive or destructive , depending on the spin of the new particle and its couplings to the higgs boson .    for a lighter sm - like higgs boson , with mass below about @xmath11 ,",
    "the most effective discovery mode at the lhc is through its decays to photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "this process arises from loops containing charged particles . in the sm ,",
    "the leading contribution to the amplitude comes from the @xmath12 gauge bosons , while the top quark provides a smaller contribution that interferes destructively . when the sm is extended to include new charged states",
    ", these exotics will also contribute to the diphoton higgs width .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm is extended beyond the sm to include a pair of @xmath13 doublets , and many new charged and colored states couple to these doublets .",
    "even so , in much of the mssm parameter space consistent with current collider bounds , the phenomenology of the lightest higgs boson is very similar to that of the sm higgs .",
    "the direct higgs search bounds from lep - ii generally prefer larger values of the higgs pseudoscalar mass parameter , @xmath14 , to push up the mass of the lightest @xmath15-even higgs boson @xmath16  @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the couplings of the @xmath16 state to sm particles are nearly identical to those of the sm higgs , up to corrections on the order of @xmath17 from mixing with the other higgs states , and loop effects due to the superpartners . for superpartner masses above a few hundred @xmath18 ,",
    "these loop corrections tend to be fairly mild , and the properties of the @xmath16 state are very similar to those of the sm higgs boson  @xcite .    in the small corner of the mssm parameter space that is consistent with generating the baryon asymmetry through ewbg , there exists a very - light , mostly right - handed stop  @xcite .",
    "this state is unusual , compared to the other superpartners in this scenario , as well as the stops that are usually considered in other supersymmetric scenarios , in that it derives most of its mass from the vacuum expectation values  ( vevs ) of the higgs fields . as such , its effect on higgs production and decay is potentially comparable to that of the top quark .",
    "it is precisely this effect that we investigate in the present work .    at tree - level in the mssm , when the right - handed stop soft mass @xmath19 is much smaller than the left - handed soft mass @xmath20 and there is not much left - right stop mixing , the coupling of the lighter mostly right - handed stop to the sm - like higgs boson is given by  @xcite g_h^0_1_1^ * v , [ gthtree ] where @xmath21 , and we normalize @xmath22 .",
    "when this coupling is positive , the light stop loops contributing to gluon fusion and di - photon decay interfere constructively with the loops of the top quark .",
    "this coupling , when it is positive , is also proportional to the higgs - stop interaction responsible for generating a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition in mssm ewbg  @xcite .",
    "thus , this scenario prefers weaker left - right stop mixing , and the increase in the strength of the phase transition is directly related to the effect of the light stop on the properties of the @xmath16 higgs boson .",
    "in contrast , when this coupling is negative or when there is strong left - right stop mixing ( for which the expression of eq .",
    "is no longer valid ) the interference of the stop loops with the top loops is destructive  @xcite .  .",
    "this quantity is always small in the light stop mssm ewbg scenario , even for @xmath23 , on account of the hierarchy @xmath24 . ]",
    "the @xmath25 coupling of eq .   receives corrections enhanced by large logarithms of the ratio @xmath26 in the light stop scenario motivated by mssm ewbg .",
    "to re - sum these logs , the heavy susy and higgs states should be integrated out at their mass thresholds  @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective theory consists of the sm with a single higgs boson @xmath16 augmented by a light stop @xmath27 and lighter gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "equivalently , the effective theory coincides with the spectrum of focus ",
    "point  @xcite , pev - scale  @xcite , or split supersymmetry  @xcite with an additional light stop . the matching and running conditions for this effective theory",
    "are computed in ref .",

    "etc_.    in this _ light - stop effective theory _",
    "( lst ) , the coupling of the stop to the higgs boson comes from the operator - q|_1 ^ 2||h|^2 , [ qcoup ] where @xmath27 is the light stop and @xmath30 is the higgs field .",
    "the coupling @xmath31 is obtained by matching at the scale @xmath28 where all the heavy higgs bosons and sfermions are integrated out .",
    "the matching condition is q(m ) = g_h^0_1_1^*(m)/v + ( ) , [ gtheff ] where @xmath32 is as in eq .   with running parameters evaluated at scale @xmath28 , and the threshold corrections",
    "are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the coupling relevant at lower scales , on the order of the higgs mass , is obtained by renormalization group  ( rg ) evolution in the effective theory down from the scale @xmath28 .",
    "expanding the higgs field about its vev , the interaction of eq .  ,",
    "evaluated near the higgs boson mass scale , then generates the effective @xmath25 coupling and contributes to the light stop mass according to g_h^0_1_1^ * & = & vq , [ lststuff ] + m__1 ^ 2 & = & m_u_3 ^ 2 + qv^2 .",
    "the coupling @xmath31 is also responsible for driving the electroweak phase transition to be first order when it is positive .",
    "therefore the effects of the light stop on the properties of the higgs boson are in direct proportion to the role of the light stop in the electroweak phase transition .    in fig .",
    "[ qcoupfig ] we show the value of the coupling @xmath31 at the light higgs mass scale in the lst as well as the uncorrected tree - level value , @xmath33 given in eq .  , evaluated using running parameters .",
    "we also set @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and we assume the gluino is light and do not integrate it out explicitly .",
    "the tree - level and lst couplings are very similar for @xmath37 but deviate significantly as this ratio grows , illustrating the improvement from the effective theory treatment .    to compute the effect of the light stop on higgs boson production and decay , we input the higgs - stop coupling as well as the higgs boson and light stop masses computed in the lst into cpsuperh  @xcite .",
    "we use a top quark mass of @xmath38 , and the gaugino / higgsino parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume all sfermions other than the light stop and all higgs bosons other than the @xmath16 are very heavy with a common mass @xmath28 . unlike the sfermions , mssm ewbg does not require that the heavy higgs states be much heavier than the electroweak scale with @xmath43 .",
    "however , @xmath44 helps to induce a strongly first - order phase transition  @xcite , and relaxing the assumption of @xmath45 will only modify our results by corrections on the order of @xmath46  @xcite . in our treatment",
    "we also remove by hand the finite corrections to the yukawa couplings from heavy superpartners since these decouple as @xmath47 provided the gluino and higgsinos remain relatively light  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ hgg1 ] we show the ratio of the decay width of the higgs boson to a pair of gluons @xmath48 computed in the lst relative to the value in the sm with the same value of the higgs boson mass as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath36 . in generating these figures we scan over the ranges @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these parameter ranges are a superset of the values that are consistent with a strongly first - order phase transition required for ewbg .",

    "[ hgg1 ] we see a significant enhancement in the decay width to gluons relative to the sm by as much as a factor of four .",
    "since this decay width is nearly proportional to the higgs production rate through gluon fusion at hadron colliders at leading order  ( lo ) , including the tevatron at @xmath54 and the lhc at @xmath55 , our results imply a strong enhancement in this production mode .",
    "width is at lo .",
    "while nlo corrections are significant , their effect is to rescale both the sm and squark lo contributions to the production rate in nearly the same way  @xcite .",

    "the diphoton branching fraction is significantly suppressed , particularly for the lower values of @xmath60 and @xmath49 favoured by ewbg .",
    "the suppression originates from two sources .",
    "first , there is destructive interference between the stop and the @xmath12 gauge bosons in the loop - level amplitude for @xmath61 .",
    "second , the enhancement of the higgs boson decay width into gluons increases the total decay width , thereby diluting the fraction of decays to photon pairs . between these two effects ,",
    "the suppression factor for @xmath62 relative to the sm is always less about 0.7 and as small as 0.5 within the region of parameters consistent with ewbg .",
    "the light charginos that are also required for successful ewbg can further modify the higgs boson decay width to diphotons .",
    "we find that this effect is less than about @xmath63 once the lep - ii bound of @xmath64 is imposed on the lightest chargino  @xcite .",

    "we also assume that gluon fusion makes up @xmath66 of the inclusive production rate before including the enhancement from a light stop , which is approximately the expected fraction contributing to the inclusive signal for a light sm higgs boson at the lhc with @xmath67  @xcite . from figs .",
    "[ hgg1 ] and [ hgg2 ] we know that the higgs boson production rate through gluon fusion is enhanced while the branching ratio into diphotons is suppressed .",
    "the total rate is approximately proportional to the product of these quantities .",

    "for example , the rate for inclusive @xmath70 at the lhc ( assuming the gluon fusion makes up @xmath66 of the total rate ) is increased by a factor of 1.753 within the parameter region consistent with viable ewbg . on the other hand",
    ", the suppression in the @xmath61 branching fraction reduces proportionally the signal rates from higgs production through vector - boson - fusion  ( vbf ) or in association with @xmath71 or @xmath72 . interesting further possibilities that we do not explore are higgs boson production in association with light stops  @xcite , or a modification of the higgs self - couplings  @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous section indicate that within the parameter region consistent with mssm ewbg the production and decay of modes of the @xmath16 higgs boson are significantly modified relative to the sm by the presence of a light stop .",
    "measuring higgs boson couplings at the tevatron and lhc will be extremely challenging , and will require both a large amount of integrated luminosity and a detailed understanding of systematics .",
    "even so , the effects of a light stop consistent with mssm ewbg on @xmath16 higgs boson observables are large enough that they can likely be distinguished from a sm higgs boson by lhc data , and may also have a discernible impact on tevatron higgs searches .    before discussing the future prospects of detecting this scenario ,",
    "let us also point out that the modifications of the higgs properties induced by a light stop do not run afoul of existing collider bounds or modify the limits imposed by previous higgs boson searches .",
    "the most stringent bound comes from lep - ii , which places a lower limit on the sm higgs boson mass of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this limit also applies to the @xmath16 state in the light stop scenario .",
    "present limits from the tevatron strongly constrain a sm higgs boson with mass near @xmath73 through searches for inclusive higgs production with decays to @xmath74  @xcite . for lighter sm - like higgs bosons with @xmath75 ,",
    "the tevatron bounds are much weaker and are dominated by the @xmath72 associated production channels with decays to @xmath76 .",
