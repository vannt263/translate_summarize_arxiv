    "systems of frictionless hard spheres serve as prototypical models in statistical physics , displaying a variety of emergent complex phenomena @xcite . owing their popularity to their inherent simplicity ,",
    "systems of frictionless hard spheres are used to model gases @xcite , supercooled liquids @xcite , dense suspensions @xcite and granular media @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of hard - sphere systems stems from the absence of energy scales in the hard - sphere interactions .",
    "it is this simplicity which makes these systems a preferred choice of model for the investigation of complex phenomena in particulate systems .",
    "perhaps the most extensively studied model of hard spheres is the fully inertial fluid , in which collisions between particles are entirely elastic . in these systems ,",
    "collisions are instantaneous , i.e. , colliding particles spend no time at all in contact , but instead conservation of energy and momentum determines the postcollision velocities as a function of the pre - collision velocities .",
    "event - driven simulations of these systems are carried out by predicting the next collision time from the instantaneous velocities and positions of the particles @xcite .",
    "then , the system is evolved forward in time directly to the next collision .    here",
    "we shall rather focus on non - brownian hard particles immersed in a viscous fluid , in the overdamped limit where inertia is negligible .",
    "we shall assume further that hydrodynamic interactions are negligible .",
    "this assumption has been made in the context of flow near jamming @xcite , where it appears to capture at least qualitatively the critical behavior in the dense limit @xcite . within the framework of these assumptions",
    ", contacts are formed between the particles upon collisions , as they are pushed towards each other .",
    "these contacts persist for finite intervals of time , during which repulsive forces are exerted between the particles in contact .",
    "our simulational approach is based on the exactly derivable equations of motion of overdamped dynamics in the hard - sphere limit , neglecting hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "these equations are used to build an event - driven simulation .",
    "the equations of motion are entirely based on geometric information , which allows us to calculate the contact forces between the constituent hard particles , and hence their distribution and evolution @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to evolve the system according to the equations of motion , while carefully handling the formation of new contacts and the opening of existing contacts between particles .",
    "our method shares some similarities with the method of contact dynamics @xcite used in dry granular materials , in which contact forces and velocities are resolved iteratively under a set of complementarity relations .",
    "the simulational scheme presented below has merits and disadvantages with respect to existing methods . in terms of bare complexity ,",
    "the method we present is far inferior to conventional molecular dynamics methods , in which the running time typically scales linearly with the number of particles , given that interactions are sufficiently short ranged .",
    "the running time of the scheme presented here scales at least quadratically with the number of particles .",
    "this is a consequence of the event - driven nature of the scheme , together with the effectively long - range interactions which can span the entire system at high packing fractions .",
    "however , when compared to existing methods in which hardsphere dynamics is approached by reducing the loading rates in systems of soft - potential interactions @xcite , our method has the advantage of directly sampling the hard - sphere limit .",
    "furthermore , our method requires essentially no adjustable parameters ; particle trajectories are invariant when length and time are measured in the appropriate microscopic units .",
    "the formalism presented here allows for useful extensions of the methods built in this work .",
    "for instance , it is straightforward to introduce hard boundaries ( such as various container shapes , hoppers , or inclined planes ) , or constructing composite particles made of any number of beads , which can be floppy or constrained as rigid bodies .",
    "the method can also be used to generate jammed packings under various loading geometries , while maintaining complete control over the identity of particles in contact , in distinction from existing methods @xcite .",
    "this control allows us to properly account for rattlers in jammed states , with no ambiguity whatsoever .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ equationofmotion ] derives the equations of motion for overdamped , frictionless hard spheres , either driven by external forces , or under imposed spatial deformations , neglecting hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "we also include an extension of our formalism for simple shear flow under fixed imposed pressure .",
    "section  [ contactnetwork ] illustrates the concept of the instantaneous contact network , which is geometric information on which the equation of motion is based .",
    "section  [ simulationdetails ] contains an elaborate description of our simulational scheme and ends with a prescription for generating jammed configurations under shear or compression .",
    "section  [ results ] describes applications of our simulation method and presents some results from our simulations , illustrating the utility of our event - driven approach .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] presents concluding remarks .",
    "consider a system of @xmath0 frictionless hard spheres ( referred to in the following as particles ) in a volume @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath2 dimensions , such that there are no overlapping particles , and some of the particles are exactly in contact : the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii . when the system is unjammed , the number of contacts @xmath3 in the system remains smaller than the number of spatial degrees of freedom @xmath4 .",
    "note that we subtract @xmath2 translations but not rotations due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we denote the @xmath2 dimensional vector of the @xmath5th particle coordinates as @xmath6 , its time derivative as @xmath7 , and define the directional differences @xmath8 , the pairwise distances @xmath9 , and the normalized directions @xmath10",
    ". we will refer to the _ contact network _ as the set of all pairs of particles that are in contact at some instance in time , and the geometric information that accompanies the network , namely the directions @xmath11 , and the pairwise distances @xmath12 .",
    "we begin the derivation with accounting for the hard - sphere interactions ; given some vector of particles velocities  @xmath13 , the rate of change induced on a pairwise distance @xmath12 is @xmath14 the above relation consists of a linear transformation of vectors from the space of the particles ( of dimension @xmath15 ) to vectors in the space of contacts ( of dimension @xmath16 ) .",
    "we define @xmath17 then eq .  ( [ foo01 ] ) can be written in bra - ket notation as @xmath18 here and in the following we use bra - ket notations with uppercase letters to denote vectors from the space of the particles ( e.g. , @xmath19 for particle velocities ) , and bra - ket notations with lower - case letters to denote vectors from the space of contacts ( e.g. , @xmath20 for the vector of pairwise distances ) .",
    "as the particles are completely rigid , they can not penetrate each other .",
    "we thus impose a constraint on the particles velocities : they must keep the distance between the pairs of particles that are in contact unchanged , if the contact force exerted between the pairs of particles is positive .",
    "we will see in section 3 how a given set of contacts between the particles does not change except at discrete points in time .",
    "except for at those discrete time points , the velocities must satisfy @xmath21 in the next two subsections we present the derivation of the equations of motion for the case of dynamics under external forces , and the case of spatial deformations of the system ( e.g. , compression or shear ) .",
    "section [ constantpressure ] contains an extension of our formalism to systems of hard particles under simple shear , with fixed imposed pressure , as opposed to fixed volume .      in our framework , there are three forces acting upon each particle : a drag force @xmath22 , the force exerted on a particle by its neighbors with which it is in contact @xmath23 , and some external driving force @xmath24 . assuming that the dynamics is overdamped , and neglecting hydrodynamic interactions , the net force on each particle must always be zero : @xmath25 we assume conventional stokes drag forces acting upon particles , which are opposite in sign and proportional to their velocities : @xmath26 where @xmath27 has units of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath27 may generally depend on the radius of the @xmath29th particle ; however , for the sake of brevity , we consider here monodisperse spheres , as the extension to polydisperse spheres is straightforward .",
    "denoting the magnitude of the ( purely repulsive ) force exerted between the @xmath30th and @xmath29th particles as @xmath31 , the forces exerted on a particle by its neighbors with which it is in contact can be written as @xmath32 the above equation , similarly to eq .",

    "we next follow eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) and operate on eq .",
    "( [ velocities2 ] ) with @xmath33 , requiring that this operation vanishes : @xmath39 the operator @xmath40 is symmetric and semi - positive definite , hence unless it is singular ( see subsect .  [",

    "( [ velocities2 ] ) provides us with the velocities @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the identity operator .",
    "this concludes the derivation of the equations of motion for the case of external driving forces ; the contact forces and the instantaneous velocities are completely determined by the external driving force @xmath38 and by the geometry of the underlying contact network encoded in the operator  @xmath33 .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) provides us with the instantaneous velocities for our system subjected to an external driving force @xmath38 .",
    "if instead one wishes to impose some mode of strain on the system , e.g.  shear or compression , the equations must be slightly modified to account for the imposed deformation instead of the driving forces .",
    "the following subsection derives the equations of motion for frictionless hard spheres under spatial deformations , assuming that the particles are immersed in a _ flowing viscous fluid _ , described by an affine velocity field @xmath44 .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions are neglected .",
    "this simple model has been originally proposed by durian @xcite , and recently popularized by olsson and tietel @xcite and others @xcite as a model for non - brownian suspension flows .",
    "the framework presented in the previous subsection naturally allows for the extension to spatial deformations within this model .",
    "the strain rate tensor @xmath45 is related to the affine velocity field via @xmath46 the affine velocity field @xmath44 should be chosen such that the desired deformation geometry is acheived .",
    "for instance , for simple shear in the @xmath47-plane one can choose @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the strain - rate . for compression",
    ", one can choose @xmath50 .",
    "special care should be taken when imposing periodic boundary conditions , since the velocities @xmath44 must be continuous across the boundaries .",
    "the operation @xmath51 results in a contact - space vector which contains the rate of change of pairs of particles in contact due to the imposed deformation ; contacts which pass across the boundary should be accounted for properly . in the case of simple shear , continuity of the velocities",
    "can be assured by employing lees - edwards boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the drag forces are now considered to be proportional to the * difference * between the imposed affine velocities and the velocities of the particles @xcite , i.e. @xmath52 using eqs .",
    "( [ moo00 ] ) and ( [ straindragforces ] ) , the force - balance equation now reads @xmath53 from here the velocities are extracted as @xmath54 to account for the hard - particle interactions , we again follow eq .",

    "the idea is to add a compressional component to the deformation rate tensor such that the resulting pressure under simple shear will be set at some pre - determined fixed pressure  @xmath58 . to this aim",
    ", we characterize the affine flow by the deformation rate tensor @xmath45 parametrized ( in two - dimensions , with a trivial extension to three - dimensions ) as @xmath59 the parameter @xmath60 stands for the ratio between the rate of isotropic compression and the rate of simple shear .",
    "a suitable choice for the affine velocities is @xmath61 as stated in subsection  ( [ spatialdeformations ] ) , the above affine velocity field should be understood to include the necessary modifications of the size and shape of the box , and the associated changes in the periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "the equations of motion derived above hold for a single instance in time .",
    "they are entirely based on the geometric information encoded in the operator @xmath33 , which is defined on the existing set of contacts at that time , and on the driving force @xmath38 or the imposed spatial deformation encoded in @xmath44 .",
    "given a configuration of the system we consider all the pair of particles in contact as our contact network ( see fig .  [ contactnetworkfig ] ) , and based on this set we calculate the operator @xmath33 .",
    "however , this set of contacts is ever - changing , as particles move apart or collide .",
    "nevertheless , the events of ` breaking ' a contact between two particles , or the formation of a new contact between two colliding particles , are instantaneous . as a result",

    "subsection ( [ correctionstep ] ) describes an algorithm which allows for the preservation of the accuracy of the contact network during long simulation runs .",
    "subsection ( [ jammed ] ) explains how jammed configurations can be generated using our simulational method .",
    "the main idea is to evolve the system by integrating the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) in time increments @xmath74 , until an occurrence of an event in which the contact network changes .",
    "these instances are inferred by considering the following three conditions at all times :    * the distance between the centers of particles that are in contact is ( up to integration errors to be discussed in the following ) the sum of their radii .",
    "* particles that are not in contact do not overlap . * the contact forces @xmath35 ( given by eq .",

    "the calculation of the next collision time is identical to the well - known calculation of the next collision time in event - driven hard sphere simulations , see for example  @xcite .",

    "the integration step @xmath74 in our simulations is set by requiring that the number of integration steps between events ( new contact formations or vanishing contact forces ) is on average larger than 10 .",
    "satisfying this criterion requires gradually smaller integration steps for larger or denser systems .",
    "moreover , in our simulations we bound the integration step by requiring @xmath82 .",
    "detection of newly formed contacts is acheived by maintaining data structures of neighbor - lists which are updated using cell - subdivisions that allow for the calculation of the neighbor - lists in a running - time which is linear in the system size @xcite .    in the following subsection",
    "we will describe and explain the rewiring procedure ; in this procedure contact forces which are rendered negative , either by the formation of a new contact , or by their natural evolution , are filtered out of the contact network .",
    "as mentioned above , the creation of a new contact may lead to the appearance of negative forces in other pre - existing contacts of the contact network .",
    "the determination of the new contact network after detection of negative contact forces is carried out by repeating the following two procedures :    *   first , we successively remove the contact with the most negative force from the contact network , and re - calculate the contact forces via eq .",
    "( [ contactforces ] ) after each such removal .",
    "the identity of all the contacts removed from the contact network during this procedure is stored .",

    "then , the velocities are calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) . *   with the velocities @xmath19 calculated at the end of procedure @xmath81",
    ", we now consider the list of _ removed contacts _ that we have constructed during procedure @xmath81 .",
    "for each removed contact , we calculate the pairwise velocity @xmath83 where the pair @xmath84 no longer belongs to the contact network .",
    "note that since we are considering pairs of particles which are no longer in contact , constraint ( [ constraint ] ) does not apply , and generally @xmath85 .",
    "for some of the pairs considered one may find that @xmath86 which means that the particles @xmath84 which were a part of the contact network are now * approaching * each other after breaking the contact between them .",
    "this scenario violates the no - overlapping condition , since this pair is ( idealy ) just in contact ( it was just removed from the contact network ) , hence if this pair has @xmath86 , it will instantly create an overlap .",
    "we treat this scenario explicitly ",
    "the pair with the most negative @xmath87 is then re - connected and added back to the contact network , and the contact forces are then re - calculated .",
    "if there remain any negative contact forces @xmath88 , or if pairs of particles * that were removed * from the contact network are still approaching each other @xmath89 , return to ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "otherwise , the final contact network has been found .",
    "the above procedure ends having in hand a contact network which satisfies conditions ( a),(b ) and ( c ) detailed in the beginning of this section .",
    "the uniqueness of the contact network obtained using the above procedure is demonstrated in appendix  a.      the integration errors in distances between pairs of particles that belong to the instantaneous contact network are of order @xmath90 .",
    "this can be shown by returning to eq .",

    "* if a new contact was formed in step @xmath104 , repeat steps @xmath105 untill no new contacts are formed .",
    "* calculate the contact forces , and filter out negative contact forces using the rewiring procedure described in subsect .",

    "our simulation can be used to generate jammed configurations , under shear deformation or under compression ( or both ) . before explaining how such configurations can be generated , we first clarify the distinction between jammed and potentially jammed configurations .    in a _ potentially jammed _ configuration the ratio between the number of contacts and the number of degrees of freedom is such that the matrix @xmath106 must have a kernel of dimension one .",

    "clearly this requires us to allow for negative contact forces between the particles which belong to the same composite - particle .",
    "other than this classification of contacts as permanent ( allowed to bear negative forces ) and temporary ( can only carry positive forces ) , the simulation scheme is identical to that described above .",
    "( [ compositefig ] ) displays a snapshot from our simulations of composite particles under shear - flow .",
    "we have introduced an event - driven simulation scheme for overdamped hard spheres under external driving forces .",

    "we have demonstrated that our method produces essentially identical results to steepest - descent minimization methods , though at greatly reduced computational cost as well as increased robustness and accuracy of the contact network information .",
    "indeed , the main virtue of our event - driven method is the control over the identity of the contact network that allows for careful study of the statistics of contact formation and breakage . in our approach",
    "there are no uncertainties nor arbitrary thresholding associated with the definition of which particles should be considered as contacts .",
    "this advantage becomes increasingly important closer to jamming where contacts rearrange very rapidly , and where many particles are very close but actually not in contact .",
    "a simple extension of the formalism presented here allows us to simulate systems under shear flow and * fixed * imposed pressure , without introducing any free parameters .",
    "this is similar to constraint methods used in conventional molecular dynamics simulations to maintain a constant pressure or temperature @xcite .",
    "this extension of our method may be useful in simulating shear flow of frictionless hard spheres close to the jamming point @xcite : in constant volume simulations , fluctuations of the critical packing fraction @xmath148 can lead to jamming and complete arrest of the flow .",
    "when fixing the pressure instead of the volume , structural fluctuations which would lead to jamming in fixed - volume simulations , merely lead to the dilatancy of the system as it expands under the increasing internal pressure , and avoiding jamming by doing so .    finally , we have demonstrated a number of possible additional applications of our method .",
    "we note here that the addition of boundaries and various container shapes is straightforward within our framework , since they can be treated on equal grounds as the contacts between the particles .",
