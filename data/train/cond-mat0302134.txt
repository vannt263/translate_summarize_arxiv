    "the search for superconductivity in the transition - metal diborides @xmath0 and @xmath1 has proven to be elusive since the first reports of superconductivity in @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite with superconducting transition temperatures @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the subsequent experimental efforts @xcite to make @xmath0 and @xmath1 superconducting by applying external pressure and/or hole doping have also proven to be futile .",
    "such an outcome for @xmath0 and @xmath1 seems somewhat surprising given that under similar conditions @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite are found to superconduct with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .    to be able to understand the superconducting properties or lack thereof of the transition - metal diborides @xmath0 and @xmath1 within the conventional bcs theory of superconductivity one needs to know the electron - phonon interaction in these systems .",
    "in particular , the strength of the electron - phonon interaction in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as reflected in the average electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 , can be used to predict the possibility of superconductivity in the diborides .",
    "experiments , based on point - contact spectroscopy @xcite , indicate @xmath3 to be less than @xmath15 for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and thus preclude the possibility of superconductivity in these diborides . here , we like to point out that the experimental determination of @xmath3 , as carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite , is more reliable for @xmath0 than for @xmath1 .",
    "previous theoretical estimates of @xmath3 @xcite , based on only zone - center sampling of the electron - phonon matrix elements , also indicate @xmath0 and @xmath1 to have a weak electron - phonon coupling with @xmath16 . however , it turns out that in the transition - metal diborides the estimates of @xmath3 based on zone - center sampling of the electron - phonon matrix elements corresponding to the optical @xmath17 mode is not reliable @xcite .",
    "thus , a detailed analysis of the electron - phonon interaction using a more representative brillouin zone sampling of the electron - phonon matrix elements is clearly needed to better understand the lack of superconductivity in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the present work is a step in that direction .    using density - functional - based methods we have studied ( i ) the electronic structure , ( ii ) the phonon density of states ( dos ) , ( iii ) the electron - phonon interaction , and ( iv ) the solutions of the isotropic eliashberg gap equation for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath2 crystal structure .",
    "we have calculated the electronic structure of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with experimental lattice constants @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as given in table i , using full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method . for studying the electron - phonon interaction we used the full - potential linear - response program of savrasov @xcite to calculate the dynamical matrices and the hopfield parameters , which were then used to calculate the phonon dos , @xmath20 , the electron - phonon coupling @xmath3 , including the partial @xmath21 , and the eliashberg function , @xmath22 , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently , we have numerically solved the isotropic eliashberg gap equation @xcite for a range of @xmath23 to obtain the corresponding superconducting transition temperature @xmath24    based on our calculations , described below , we find that the electron - phonon coupling in @xmath0 is much weaker than in @xmath1 . in particular , we find that the average electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 is equal to @xmath4 for @xmath0 and @xmath5 for @xmath1 .",
    "the solutions of the isotropic eliashberg gap equation indicate no superconductivity for @xmath0 but a superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 of around @xmath7 for @xmath1 with @xmath8 .",
    "within migdal - eliashberg theory of superconductivity @xcite , first - principles calculations of superconducting properties require the knowledge of ( i ) the ground - state electronic structure , ( ii ) the vibrational spectrum and ( iii ) the electron - phonon matrix elements of the solid .",
    "the phonon spectrum and the electron - phonon matrix elements are then used to calculate the eliashberg functions from which the superconducting properties of the materials can be calculated . in particular , by solving the fully anisotropic or the isotropic gap equation the superconducting transition temperature can be calculated .",
    "the density - functional theory provides a reliable framework for implementing from first - principles the migdal - eliashberg approach for calculating the superconducting properties of metals as outlined above .",
    "such an approach has been implemented by savrasov using the lmto formalism and the linear response method , the details of which are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we briefly outline the approach used in the present calculations .",
    "we follow the notation used in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we calculate the ground - state electronic structure of the transition - metal diborides @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital method in the generalized - gradient approximation of the density - functional theory .",
    "the linear response approach is used to evaluate the dynamical matrices and the electron - phonon matrix elements within the density - functional theory as implemented using the lmto formalism .",
    "it amounts to self - consistently evaluating the changes in the electronic structure due to atomic displacements associated with the phonon mode @xmath25 .",
    "once the changes in the wave function , density and the effective potential are known , the phonon density of states@xmath26 and the electron - phonon matrix elements    @xmath27    can be evaluated .",
    "the electron - phonon matrix elements can be interpreted as the scattering of electron in state @xmath28 to state @xmath29 due to perturbing potential @xmath30 , which arises due to the phonon mode @xmath25 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ eq : me ] has to be corrected for the incomplete basis set as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the electron - phonon matrix elements",
    "we can calculate the phonon linewidth @xmath31    @xmath32    occasionally , it is useful to define a phonon mode dependent electron - phonon coupling @xmath33 as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the electronic density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "now we can combine the electronic density of states , phonon spectrum and the electron - phonon matrix elements to obtain the eliashberg function @xmath22 defined as    @xmath36    finally , the eliashberg functions can be used to solve the isotropic gap equation @xcite@xmath37 to obtain the superconducting properties such as the superconducting transition temperature @xmath24 the function @xmath38 used in the gap equation is defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 representing the sign of @xmath42 the electron - phonon coupling @xmath43 is given by @xmath44    before describing our results in detail , we provide some of the computational details which are similar to our study of the electron - phonon interaction in @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the charge self - consistent full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital calculations were carried out with the generalized gradient approximation for exchange - correlation of perdew _ et al _ @xcite and 484 @xmath47-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "for @xmath1 , the basis set used consisted of @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 orbitals at the @xmath52 site and @xmath48 @xmath53 and @xmath50 orbitals at the @xmath54 site . in the case of @xmath0 , we included @xmath55 , @xmath53 and @xmath50 orbitals at the @xmath56 site . in all cases the potential and the wave function were expanded up to @xmath57 .",
    "the muffin - tin radii for @xmath52 , @xmath54 , and @xmath56 were taken to be @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 atomic units , respectively .",
    "the calculation of dynamical matrices and the hopfield parameters for @xmath0 and @xmath1 were carried out using a @xmath61 grid resulting in @xmath62 irreducible @xmath63-points .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations for charge self - consistency during linear response calculations were carried out using a @xmath64 grid of @xmath47-points .",
    "the fermi surface was sampled more accurately with a @xmath65 grid of @xmath47-points using the double grid technique as outlined in ref . @xcite . in case of @xmath66",
    "for a couple of @xmath63-points we had to sample the fermi surface using a @xmath67 grid of @xmath47-points to get converged acoustic - mode frequencies .",
    ".the experimental lattice constants for @xmath0 and @xmath1 used in the calculations . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from fig .",
    "3 , we also see that in the case of @xmath0 the phonon mode with peak at @xmath68 , which corresponds to the in - plane @xmath69 motion , couples to the electrons more than the phonon mode with peak at @xmath70 however , in @xmath1 it is the phonon mode corresponding to the displacements of the transition - metal atom @xmath52 , with a peak at @xmath71 , which couples more strongly to the electrons .",
    "such a change in @xmath22 clearly indicates a more active role for the transition - metal atoms in deciding the normal as well as the superconducting state ( if any ) properties of the transition - metal diborides .",
    "our calculated @xmath22 for @xmath0 agrees with the point - contact spectroscopy results of refs .",
    "however , in our opinion , the experimentally obtained @xmath22 for @xmath1 in ref .",
    "@xcite is underestimated , and it is in disagreement with the present result . in table",
    "ii we have listed the hopfield parameter @xmath72 the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 , and the various averages of the phonon frequencies for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .      the possibility of superconductivity in @xmath0 and @xmath1 within the present approach can be checked by solving numerically the isotropic gap equation @xcite using the calculated eliashberg function @xmath22 .",
    "the results of such a calculation for @xmath1 are shown in fig . 4 for a range of values of @xmath73 from fig .",
    "4 we find that for @xmath74 the @xmath6 for @xmath1 is equal to @xmath75 .",
    "a similar calculation for @xmath0 using the calculated eliashberg function yields a @xmath6 of less than @xmath76 .",
    "our results show that @xmath0 is unlikely to show superconductivity , in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , the calculated eliashberg function for @xmath0 agrees well with the corresponding eliashberg function obtained from point - contact spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "however , our calculations predict @xmath1 to superconduct with a @xmath77 but so far no superconductivity @xcite has been found ( except for ref .",
    "although our calculated values of @xmath22 and consequently @xmath3 can be improved upon by including more * q*-points in the linear response calculations but it is unlikely to change the main conclusions of the present work .",
    "thus , the reasons for the lack of superconductivity in @xmath1 need to be explored further .      the first - principles study of superconducting properties of solids as carried out above is computationally demanding . in particular ,",
    "the requirement of electronic self - consistency for phonon wave vector @xmath63 and mode @xmath78 makes the computational effort prohibitive unless one makes a judicious choice of @xmath63 vectors .",
    "however , one must ensure that the calculated results are converged with respect to the number of @xmath63 vectors . to demonstrate the convergence of our calculated phonon density of states",
    "@xmath79 eliashberg functions @xmath22 and the superconducting transition temperature @xmath80 we have carried out two sets of calculations using the double - grid technique as outlined in ref .",
    "we have used two @xmath63 grids ( i ) a @xmath81 grid with @xmath82 irreducible @xmath63-points and ( ii ) a @xmath61 grid with @xmath62 irreducible @xmath63-points .",
    "all the results described so far correspond to the second grid with @xmath62 @xmath63-points .",
    "below we show a comparison of @xmath79 @xmath22 and @xmath6 calculated using the two grids with @xmath82 and @xmath62 @xmath63-points , respectively .    in fig .",
    "5 we compare @xmath20 calculated using the two grids with @xmath82 and @xmath62 @xmath63-points , respectively . in general , dynamical matrices and consequently the phonon spectrum do not require a very fine @xmath47-mesh for convergence .",
    "however , the increase in the number of @xmath63-points has understandably reduced the peak heights at @xmath83 approximately equal to @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath0 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90    the convergence of @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where we have plotted @xmath22 calculated using the two grids with @xmath82 and @xmath62 @xmath63-points , respectively . for @xmath0",
    "the differences are small in magnitude except at around @xmath91 while for @xmath1 the effects due to small number of * @xmath63 * -points are reduced with the use of the @xmath62 * @xmath63 * -point grid .",
    "we also see that the integrated values such as the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 do not change appreciably between the two sets of calculations ( @xmath3 changes by @xmath92 for @xmath0 and @xmath93 for @xmath1 ) .    as @xmath20 and @xmath22 do not change significantly between the two sets of calculations , we do not expect a significant change in the solutions of the isotropic gap equation .",
    "consequently , the calculated @xmath6 should be similar in the two cases . in fig .",
    "7 , we show the @xmath6 obtained for the two sets of calculations , and the difference of less than @xmath94 between the two sets of calculations confirms the convergence of @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath6 .",
    "we have studied electron - phonon interaction in @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath2 crystal structure using full - potential , density - functional - based methods .",
