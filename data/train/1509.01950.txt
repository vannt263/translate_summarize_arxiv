    "since many decades , design codes ensure a very low probability that a building collapses under ordinary loads , like self weight , dead and live service load , or snow .",
    "nevertheless buildings still do collapse , from time to time .",
    "an extremely small fraction of collapses originates from unlikely combinations of intense ordinary load with very poor strength of the building .",
    "the majority of structural collapses are due to accidental events that are not considered in standard design .",
    "examples of such events are : gross design or construction errors , irresponsible disregard of rules or design prescriptions , and several rare load scenarios like e.g.  earthquakes , fire , floods , settlements , impacts , or explosions @xcite .",
    "accidental events have low probability of occurrence , but high potential negative consequences . since risk is a combination of probability and consequences , the risk related to accidental events",
    "is generally significant @xcite .    in 1968",
    "a gas explosion provoked the partial collapse of the ronan point building in london .",
    "this event highlighted for the first time the urgency for _ robust _ structures , enduring safety in extraordinary scenarios @xcite .",
    "since then , interes was driven by striking catastrophic collapses @xcite , until in 2001 the tragic collapse of the world trade center renewed the attention to the topic ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the last decades , several design rules aimed at improving structural robustness have been developed ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "accidental events can be classified into _ identified _ and _ unidentified _ @xcite .",
    "identified events are statistically characterizable in terms of intensity and frequency of occurrence .",
    "examples are earthquakes , fire not fueled by external sources , gas explosions , and unintentional impacts by ordinary vehicles , airplanes , trains , or boats . specific design rules and even entire codes",
    "are devoted to specific identified accidental events .",
    "unidentified events comprise a wide variety of incidents whose intensity and frequency of occurrence can not be described statistically , e.g.  terrorist attacks or gross errors .",
    "the risk related to unidentified accidental events can be mitigated both by structural and nonstructural measures @xcite .",
    "nonstructural measures such as barriers and monitoring can reduce the probability that an accidental event affects the structural integrity , others like a wise distribution of plants and facilities can minimize the negative consequences of eventual collapses .",
    "otherwise , structural measures can improve local resistance of structural elements to direct damage , e.g.  the design of _ key elements _ for intense local load @xcite , or the application of the _ enhanced local resistance _",
    "method @xcite .",
    "structural measures can also provide progressive collapse resistance , i.e.  prevent spreading of local direct damage inside the structure to an extent that is disproportioned with respect to the initial event .",
    "usual strategies to improve progressive collapse resistance are compartmentalization of structures @xcite and delocalization of stress after local damage .",
    "stress delocalization can be obtained exploiting redundancy , plastic stress redistributions ( masoero , wittel et al . , 2010 ) , ties @xcite , and moment resisting connections @xcite .    nowadays",
    "several design codes employ the conventinal _ alternate load path method ( alpm ) _ to evaluate progressive collapse resistance , e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method consists in removing one key element , generally a column or a wall , and measuring the extent of subsequent collapse .",
    "if the final collapse is unacceptably wide , some of the previously listed measures have to be employed . hence structures are first designed and subsequently tested to be robust - they are not conceived _ a priori_.",
    "this course of action excludes optimizations of the basic structural topology and geometry , that actually play a key role in the response to local damage , considering as an example the very different behavior of redundant and statically determined structures .",
    "anti - seismic design @xcite already contains some prescriptions that should be considered before starting a new design , e.g.  geometric regularity on the horizontal and on the vertical planes .",
    "furthermore , anti - seismic _ capacity design _ requires a hierarchy of the structural elements ensuring that earthquakes can only provoke ductile collapse of the horizontal beams , while failure of columns and brittle ruptures due to shear are inhibited .",
    "differently , for what concerns progressive collapse resistance , optimal overall geometric features are not known , except for the concepts of redundancy and compartmentalization .",
    "furthermore , the idea of hierarchically maximizing progressive collapse resistance is completely absent .    in this paper",
    ", we make a first step to cover this deficiency , showing that progressive collapse resistance can be improved by hierarchy in the overall geometry ( _ topological _ hierarchy ) and in the relative strength and stiffness of horizontal and vertical structural elements ( _ mechanical _ hierarchy ) .",
    "our approach incorporates the simulation of progressive collapse of regular 2d frames made of reinforced concrete ( rc ) subjected to the sudden removal of structural elements , following the alpm  framework .",
    "we first describe the analyzed frame structures and briefly sketch the approach that is based on the _ discrete element method ( dem)_. after the model description , we present the results of the simulations , with focus on the effect of geometry and hierarchy on the activated collapse mechanisms and , consequently , on progressive collapse resistance .",

    "it is worth noting that horizontal ties and diaphragms increase the strength both after and before damage , causing a compensation that limits the effect on @xmath125 .",
    "finally , future works can incorporate a detailed description of structural connections , which are crucial for energy dissipation , catenary effect , and compartmentalization .",
    "coming back to the central theme of structural hierarchy , our results already suggest that hierarchical structures are more robust toward accidental damage",
    ". an optimal solution would be to design : 1 ) a primary frame made of few large elements , with columns weaker than the beams , and 2 ) a secondary structure , made of many smaller elements , which defines the living space and follows traditional design rules .",
    "the primary frame would provide topological hierarchy , maximizing @xmath0 toward bending collapse and enabling new possible compartmentalization strategies .",
    "the strong beams and weak columns of the primary frame would favor pancake collapse over bending collapse , and improve the vertical compartmentalization of high - rise buildings against falling debris . on the other hand , in real structures , the beams generally fail before the columns , and",
    "imposing the opposite is expensive .",
    "nevertheless , designing a strong - beam weak - column behavior _ only for the primary frame _ can significantly limit the extra cost .",
    "hierarchical structures can be a novel and somehow counterintuitive feature of robustness - oriented capacity design .",
    "planning structural hierarchy requires understanding the complex system response to local damage , and should drive the design process since the very beginning .",
    "by contrast , traditional design is focused on local resistance against ordinary actions , and considers robustness toward accidents only at the end .",
    "this generally leads to non - hierarchical structures with strong columns and poorly understood system behavior .",
    "in addition , anti - seismic capacity design requires plastic failure of the beams to precede columns rupture ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "in this appendix , we compare the numerical predictions of our dem model with the experimental observations in @xcite .",
    "we also briefly discuss some effects of catenary actions on collapse resistance .",
    "the experimental setup in @xcite consists of a plane frame made of reinforced concrete ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_exper](a ) ) .",
    "columns are square in section ( 200x200 mm ) , beams are rectangular ( 200 mm tall , 100 mm wide ) . everywhere ,",
    "the longitudinal reinforcement is symmetrically distributed within the cross section ( 4@xmath12812 steel bars ) .",
    "the strength and ultimate strain of concrete and steel are specified in @xcite , while the elastic moduli are not .",
    "the mid column at the first floor is replaced by jacks that provides an upward vertical force @xmath129 . in the middle of the top floor",
    ", a servo - hydraulic actuator applies a constant downward vertical force @xmath130=109kn , to represent the self weight of upper stories .",
    "initially @xmath131109kn , and then it is progressively reduced to reproduce quasi - static column loss , until a bending mechanism triggers collapse ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_exper](b ) ) . during the experiments , the increasing values of the midspan inflection @xmath132",
    "is plotted against @xmath129 , to get the force - displacement reaction curve .",
    "the integral of the curve represents the energy dissipation capacity , which relates to the dynamic strength of the structure with respect to the activated collapse mechanism .",
    "our target is to capture the experimental reaction curve @xmath133 through dem simulations .",
    "the parametrization of our model , based on the geometry and mechanical data in @xcite , is straightforward .",
    "therefore , we focus on the discrepancies between model and experimental inputs , and a few necessary additional assumptions . regarding the overall geometry , we consider all the columns to be equally tall ( 1,100 mm ) , while in the experiments the columns at the first floor were taller ( 1,567 mm ) .",
    "this discrepancy should not have a significant effect on the collapse mechanism and the strength .",
    "the mechanical behavior of the real steel bars was strain hardening , with yielding at 416mpa , and rupture at 526mpa . in our model , we consider two limit cases of elastic - perfectly plastic behavior of the steel bars : _ weak steel _",
    "`` ws '' with yielding threshold set at 416mpa , and _ strong steel _ `` ss '' yielding at 526mpa .",
    "@xcite provide two measures of the ultimate tensile strain @xmath134 of the steel bars .",
    "we employ @xmath135 , which was measured on a longer bar segment , because in our simulation the strain develops within relatively long euler - bernoulli beam elements , ebes .",
    "we assume young moduli @xmath136gpa for the steel , and @xmath137gpa for the concrete . in order to better understand the development of catenary actions , we consider two limit cases of cross section behavior under tension : _ fully reacting sections _",
    "`` frs '' , where the concrete always contributes to the tensile stiffness , and _ partially reacting sections _",
    "`` prs '' , where the concrete cracks and only the steel provides axial stiffness as soon as the cross section goes in tension . furthermore , in order to focus exclusively on ruptures due to tensile strain in the steel , we allow for an infinite rotation capacity of the cross sections .",
    "we subject our model frames to gravity , but remain in the quasi - static regime by adding a high viscous damping force proportional to the velocity of each spherical discrete element .",
    "we repeat numerous simulations with fixed @xmath138kn and @xmath129 , ranging from @xmath139kn to values that are small enough to cause the quasi - static rupture of at least one ebe .",
    "we track the midspan deflection @xmath140for comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig_exper](c ) .        in the experimental results ,",
    "as @xmath129 decreases , the system crosses several stages : ( i ) linear elastic @xmath141 mm , ( ii ) elasto - plastic @xmath142 mm , ( iii ) plastic hinges @xmath143 mm , ( iv ) catenary action @xmath144 mm , and ( v ) collapse .",
    "the transition from elastic to elasto - plastic is not evident from the curve , as well as that from plastic hinge to catenary action .",
    "by contrast , plastic hinges formation is clearly marked by a sudden change of slope at @xmath145 mm .",
    "our simulations do not capture the initial elasto - plastic stage because we do not model the non - linear elasto - plastic behavior of concrete .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of the stiffness @xmath146 before the formation of the plastic hinges . nevertheless , the additional strain energy produced by this approximation is negligible when compared to the energy dissipated in the subsequent stages , ie .",
    "the overestimation of the initial stiffness is irrelevant for the actual dynamic collapse . assuming weak steel ws , yielding at 416mpa , provides a good agreement with the experiment in terms of transition point to the plastic hinges stage . considering fractured concrete under tension yields the prs - ws curve , which underestimates the structural strength at large @xmath132 .",
    "the reason for this divergence can be that the steel hardens under strain , with reaction stress increasing from from 416mpa ( ws ) to 526mpa ( ss ) . this interpretation is supported by the fact that the prs - ws and prs - ss curves envelop the experimental one . in particular , the prs - ss curve reproduces well the last part of the experimental curve , as well as the collapse point .      despite strong simplifying assumptions in the formulation , our dem model provides reasonably good quantitative predictions of the experimental results . for the simulations in the body of this paper , we always considered fully reactive cross sections with concrete that does not crack under tension . the frs - ws curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_exper](c ) shows that this assumption leads to an overestimation of the static collapse strength against column removal ( @xmath147% ) .",
    "let us conjecture that frs induce the same strength increase of + 70% in the structure without column removal , i.e.  in @xmath148 . from a heuristic application of energy conservation , one can estimate the dynamic collapse load after sudden column removal by considering the mean @xmath129 in the catenary stage : @xmath149kn from the experiment , and @xmath150kn from the simulation with frs - ws .",
    "consequently , the increase in post - damage dynamic collapse strength @xmath127 due to frs is approximately @xmath151% . in conclusion ,",
    "assuming fully reactive cross sections causes an _ underestimation _ of the residual strength fraction @xmath152 , which our example quantifies as @xmath153% . however this assumption does not affect the main statement of this work on hierarchical structures"
