    "the generation of a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves is a fundamental prediction of inflationary models for the early universe .",
    "its amplitude is determined by the energy scale of inflation , which can widely vary between different inflationary models .",
    "the detection of this gravitational radiation would provide a crucial test for the validity of the whole scenario .",
    "gravitational wave detectors , however , are quite unlikely to have enough sensitivity to detect such a primordial signal , owing both to its smallness and to its extremely low characteristic frequencies .",
    "the existence of ultra - low - frequency gravitational radiation , however , can be indirectly probed thanks to the temperature anisotropy and polarization it induces on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . in particular , the curl component ,",
    "called b - mode , of the cmb polarization provides a unique opportunity to disentangle the effect of tensor ( gravitational - wave ) from scalar perturbations , as this is only excited by either tensor or vector modes @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", future satellite missions , such as _ planck _ , which will have enough sensitivity to either detect or constrain the b - mode cmb polarization predicted by the simplest inflationary models , might represent the first ` space - based gravitational - wave detector ' @xcite .",
    "the main complication in this context comes from the effect of gravitational lensing on the cmb by the matter distribution , which implies the transformation of e - mode into b - mode polarization @xcite : such a non - linear effect might actually obscure the signal due to primordial tensor modes . it has been pointed out that the inflationary gravitational - wave background can only be detected by cmb polarization measurements if the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath1 , which corresponds to an energy scale of inflation larger than @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "quite recently , however , a better technique to _ clean _ polarization maps from the lensing effect has been proposed , which would allow tensor - to - scalar ratios as low as @xmath3 , or even smaller , to be probed @xcite .",
    "other secondary contributions to the b - type polarization arising during the reionization stage , though of much smaller amplitude , have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the case of vector modes is even more interesting , as they can not be produced during inflation and are in general extremely difficult to generate at early epochs , with the exception of models which predict the existence of primordial tangled magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this paper considers a new source of b - mode polarization , coming from secondary vector and tensor modes .",
    "the contribution to temperature anisotropy arising from these modes has already been analyzed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the evolution of cosmological perturbations away from the linear regime is in fact characterized by mode - mixing , which not only implies that different fourier modes influence each other , but also that primordial density perturbations act as a source for curl vector perturbations and gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that these secondary vector and tensor modes always exist and that their amplitude has a one - to - one relation with the level of density perturbations , which is severely constrained by both cmb anisotropy measurements and large - scale structure observations .",
    "therefore , their properties are largely inflation model - independent , contrary to primary tensor modes whose amplitude is not only model - dependent , but is well - known to be suppressed in some cases , like e.g. in the so - called _ curvaton _ model for the generation of curvature perturbations @xcite .    the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the second - order vector and tensor modes which are produced by the non - linear evolution of primordial scalar perturbations .",
