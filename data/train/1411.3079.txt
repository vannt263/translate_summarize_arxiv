    "we work over an algebraically closed field @xmath3 of characteristic 2 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give a 1-dimensional family of enriques surfaces in characteristic 2 covered by the supersingular @xmath0 surface with artin invariant 1 . in the paper @xcite , bombieri and mumford classified enriques surfaces into three classes , namely , singular , classical and supersingular enriques surfaces . as in the case of characteristic @xmath4 , an enriques surface @xmath5 in characteristic 2 has a canonical double cover @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 is a separable double cover , a purely inseparable @xmath8- or @xmath9-cover according to @xmath5 being singular , classical or supersingular .",
    "the surface @xmath10 might have singularities , but it is @xmath0-like in the sense that its dualizing sheaf is trivial .",
    "bombieri and mumford gave an explicit example of each type of enriques surface as a quotient of the intersection of three quadrics in @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , they gave an @xmath9-covering @xmath12 such that @xmath10 is a supersingular @xmath0 surface with 12 rational double points of type @xmath13 .",
    "recently liedtke @xcite showed that the moduli space of enriques surfaces with a polarization of degree @xmath14 has two @xmath15-dimensional irreducible components .",
    "a general member of one component ( resp .",
    "the other component ) consists of singular ( resp .",
    "classical ) enriques surfaces .",
    "the intersection of two components parametrizes supersingular enriques surfaces .",
    "on the other hand , ekedahl , hyland and shepherd - barron @xcite studied classical or supersingular enriques surfaces whose canonical covers are supersingular @xmath0 surfaces with 12 rational double points of type @xmath13 .",
    "they showed that the moduli space of such enriques surfaces is an open piece of a @xmath16-bundle over the moduli space of supersingular @xmath0 surfaces . recall that the moduli space of supersingular @xmath0 surfaces is 9-dimensional and is stratified by artin invariant @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "each stratum has dimension @xmath19 ( artin @xcite , rudakov - shafarevich @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "stimulating by ekedahl , hyland and shepherd - barron s work , we present a 1-dimensional family of enriques surfaces whose canonical covers are the ( unique ) supersingular @xmath0 surface with artin invariant 1 .",
    "these enriques surfaces are parametrized by @xmath20 if @xmath21 , then the enriques surface is supersingular , and otherwise it is classical ( theorem [ main ] ) . to construct these enriques surfaces",
    ", we consider an elliptic surface defined by @xmath22 which has four singular fibers of type @xmath23 over @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . by taking frobenius base change @xmath26",

    ", we have an elliptic @xmath0 surface @xmath28 which is supersingular because @xmath29 has four singular fibers of type @xmath30 and hence its picard number should be 22 . the enriques surface @xmath31 is obtained as the quotient surface of @xmath10 by a rational vector field @xmath32 the construction is based on a theory of inseparable double covering due to rudakov - shafarevich @xcite ( see also katsura - takeda @xcite ) .    the supersingular @xmath0 surface @xmath10 has artin invariant @xmath33 .",
    "it was studied by dolgachev and the second author @xcite ( also see katsura - kondo @xcite ) .",
    "it contains 42 nonsingular rational curves forming @xmath34-configuration .",
    "these 42 curves are nothing but 24 components of four singular fibers of type @xmath30 and 18 sections of the fibration @xmath29 .",
    "the automorphism group @xmath35 is generated by a subgroup @xmath36 and @xmath37 involutions associated with some @xmath38-divisors on @xmath10 . from this description",
    ", we see that there exist 30 nonsingular rational curves and ten non - effective @xmath2-divisors on the enriques surface @xmath5 ( see sections [ s5 ] , [ s6 ] ) .",
    "the dual graph @xmath39 of these 40 divisors coincides with a graph obtained from an incidence relation between fifteen transpositions , fifteen permutations of type @xmath40 and ten permutations of type @xmath41 in the symmetric group @xmath42 of degree six .",
    "recall that fifteen transpositions are called sylvester s duads and fifteen permutations of type @xmath40 sylvester s synthemes ( see baker @xcite , p.220 ) .",
    "it is possible to choose a set of five synthemes which together contain all the fifteen duads .",
    "such a family is called a total .",
    "the number of possible totals is six . and",
    "every two totals have one , and only one syntheme in common between them .",
    "we remark that there exist twelve (= six plus six ) points on @xmath5 which have the following property : if we denote by @xmath43 and @xmath44 these twelve points suitably , then the nodal curve corresponding to the transposition @xmath45 passes the points @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the six points @xmath44 can be considered as six totals so that the nodal curve corresponding to a syntheme appeared in two synthemes , for example , a and b , passes the points @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see section [ s5 ] )",
    ". moreover these 40 divisors have the following remarkable property .",
