    "starting from the early nineties , boris dubrovin and many of his collaborators have studied the relation between gromov - witten theory and the theory of integrable systems of pdes , which was first noticed by witten in @xcite .",
    "the axioms of frobenius manifold , cf .",
    "@xcite , encode all the properties that are satisfied by the algebraic structure generated by rational gromov - witten theory and that , in particular , generate an integrable hamiltonian system of evolutionary pdes .",
    "the structure of frobenius manifold has proven to be central in many different areas of mathematics , from algebra to singularity theory , and provides for instance the most immediate approach to mirror symmetry .",
    "+ one of the consequences of the axioms of a ( homogenous ) frobenius manifold is that the associated hamiltonian system of pdes is actually bihamiltonian .",
    "bihamiltonian structures where introduced by magri in @xcite in the analysis of the so - called lenard scheme ( see e.g @xcite ) to construct the kdv integrals .",
    "they consist of a manifold endowed with two poisson tensors @xmath1 and @xmath2 , mutually compatible in the sense that their schouten - nijenhuis bracket @xmath3 $ ] vanishes . under the condition that the poisson pencil @xmath4 ( a one - parametric family of poisson tensors ) has constant co - rank there exists a simple ricursive procedure for constructing a sequence of commuting integrals for both poisson structures ( see also @xcite and the author s survey @xcite ) .",
    "let p be a manifold endowed with compatible poisson tensors @xmath1 , @xmath2 and associated poisson brackets @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 for arbitrary sufficiently small @xmath8 .",
    "then the coefficients of the taylor expansion @xmath9 of the casimirs @xmath10 , @xmath11 of poisson tensor @xmath12 commute with respect to both poisson brackets , @xmath13 moreover @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "+    while in the literature this procedure is often called bihamiltonian recursion , we will use the term _ bihamiltonian reconstruction _",
    ", to avoid confusion with the property of a sequence of symmetries @xmath16 of being in _ bihamiltonian recursion _ if @xmath17 for some constant coefficients @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "+ in the context of gromov - witten theory and the associated frobenius manifolds such reconstruction can be used to recover at least part of the symmetries for the hamiltonian system .",
    "actually , with great generality , given a homogeneous frobenius manifold , finding a fundamental solution for the so called deformed flat connection ( a special case of topological recursion relations for rational one - descendant gw invariants , see @xcite ) is a more powerful way to reconstruct the algebra of symmetries and , moreover , with this method the solution is automatically normalized to match the generating series of rational one - descendant gw invariants ( often called @xmath21-function in the gromov - witten literature ) . besides",
    ", the symmetries found this way are in bihamiltonian recursion anyway .",
    "+ in contrast , bihamiltonian reconstruction is not , in general , directly related with enumerative geometry , which results in discrepancies with the @xmath21-function .",
    "even worse , even when the hypothesis of the above theorem are satisfied , it might happen that the two poisson tensors have some casimir in common .",
    "this means that , when starting with such common casimirs as @xmath22 , in the above taylor expansion , all of the other coefficients trivially vanish .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the case of the gromov - witten theory of the projective line @xmath23 , where bihamiltonian recursion is only capable of recovering the symmetries generated by descendants of the khler class , but not those of the unity class . this pathology of the poisson pencil is called _ resonance_. + this paper deals with symplectic field theory ( sft ) and a recursion procedure for descendants that has much in common with bihamiltonian recursion in gromov - witten theory . introduced by h. hofer , a. givental and y. eliashberg in 2000 @xcite , sft is a very large project and can be viewed as a topological quantum field theory approach to gromov - witten theory . besides providing a unified view on",
    "established pseudoholomorphic curve theories like symplectic floer homology , contact homology and gromov - witten theory , it sheds considerable light on the appearence of infinite dimensional hamiltonian systems in the theory of holomorphic curves ( see @xcite for an review on this topic which includes sft ) .",
    "+ indeed , symplectic field theory leads to algebraic invariants with very rich algebraic structures and in particular , as it was pointed out by eliashberg in his icm 2006 plenary talk ( @xcite ) , the integrable systems of rational gromov - witten theory very naturally appear in rational symplectic field theory by using the link between the rational symplectic field theory of prequantization spaces in the morse - bott version and the rational gromov - witten potential of the underlying symplectic manifold ( see the recent papers @xcite , @xcite ) . after introducing gravitational descendants ( see @xcite ) along the lines of gromov - witten theory , it is precisely the natural algebraic structure of sft that provides a natural link between holomorphic curves and ( quantum ) integrable systems .",
    "+ in this paper we explore the potentiality of an intrinsic difference between gromov - witten and symplectic field theory : the moduli spaces of holomorphic maps studied by the latter carry special evaluation maps controlling the relative gluing angle of different components of a multi - floor configuration ( the sft generalization of nodal curves , see @xcite ) .",
    "these can be used to define new correlators that were not present in the original theory , but give interesting recursive formulas for one - point descendants ( and probably beyond ) , which are similar but not equivalent to bihamiltonian reconstruction , topological recursion and , ultimately , to the integrability properties of the sft infinite dimensional hamiltonian system .",
    "+ in many senses these extra correlators which control the gluing angles of different components of curves in the boundary strata are a natural generalization of the non-@xmath0-equivariant differential for the non - equivariant linearized contact homology of bourgeois - oancea , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , to non - linearized contact homology and full rational sft . with this in mind",
    "we conclude that the non - equivariant differential plays a role similar to the second poisson structure of gromov - witten theory with respect to gravitational descendants .",
    "more precisely we show how our generalized non - equivariant differential ( the potential encoding such new correlators ) , denoted by by @xmath24 , satisfies ( in contact homology ) the axioms of a nijenhuis operator .",
    "+ recall from magri and fuchsteiner , @xcite@xcite , that on a manifold @xmath25 , a nijenhuis ( or hereditary ) operator @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 denotes the space of @xmath28-tensor fields on @xmath25 ) is one whose nijenhuis torsion vanishes : @xmath29 this condition ensures that , given a sequence of commuting vector fields @xmath30=0,\\qquad \\alpha,\\beta=1,\\ldots , n\\ ] ] that are also symmetries of the operator @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath31 , we can enlarge the commuting system by recursively applying the operator @xmath24 : @xmath32=0,\\qquad k , j\\in\\mathbb{n}.\\ ] ] given a poisson tensor @xmath33 on @xmath25 , in @xcite magri and morosi further studied the compatibility conditions of a nijenhuis operator @xmath24 with the poisson structure .",
    "@xmath24 is said to be compatible with @xmath34 if the following two conditions hold : @xmath35 @xmath36 when these equations are satisfied , the pair @xmath37 is called a poisson - nijenhuis structure on @xmath25 . the main property ,",
    "then , is that one can define a sequence of @xmath38-tensors @xmath39 , @xmath40 which are poisson and are pairwise compatible in the sense that they pairwise form poisson pencils . in particular we get the bihamiltonian structure @xmath41 .",
    "+ the theory of poisson - nijenhuis structure is very well developed and its relation with integrability is deep . in particular the study of the spectrum of",
    "@xmath24 plays a fundamental role , in that the eigenvalues of @xmath24 form a system of commuting symmetries in bihamiltonian recursion ( see for instance @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "+ the first part of the paper deals with the contact homology case . in contact homology , thanks to the total absence of non - constant nodal configurations ( due to the maximum principle for holomorphic curves in symplectizations ) , we prove that the knowledge of @xmath24 and of the primary theory ( contact homology differential @xmath42 , with no descendants ) is sufficient to completely reconstruct the descendant vector fields @xmath43 as differential operators in the variables associated to reeb orbits on contact homology . + in the case of full rational sft ( of any target stable hamiltonian structure ) ,",
    "our bihamiltonian recursion is slightly less effective because of the presence of non - constant nodal curves .",
    "formally the result is similar , i.e. the descendant hamiltonians @xmath44 satisfy recursion relations which are completely analogus to bihamiltonian recursion for a pair of bivectors @xmath45 , where @xmath34 is the natural poisson structure on the sft homology algebra and @xmath46 is a _ graded symmetric _ even bivector which is the sft - generalization of @xmath24 .",
    "+ in any case this looks like a fundamental step in understanding the relation between completeness of the contact homology vector field system , or the sft hamiltonian system , and the underlying symplectic topology of the target manifold .",
