    "it has become generally accepted that supermassive black holes ( sbh ) lie at the center of most , if not all , galaxies ( e.g. , richstone et al . , 1998 ; van der marel , 1999 ) , with some lying dormant and others being triggered into an active phase to produce active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , haehnelt & rees , 1993 ; silk & rees , 1998 ) . the power source for this activity is thought to be accretion of material onto the sbh , with the infalling material forming an accretion disk which , depending on detailed conditions , then regulates the fueling rate ( e.g. narayan & yi , 1994 ; kato , fukue & mineshige , 1998 ; blandford & begelman , 1998 ) . the radius to which these accretion disks extend ( and hence become more easily observable ) is not well established , but current agn unification schemes advocate a geometrically thick and clumpy torus ( e.g. krolik & begelman , 1988 ; krolik and lepp , 1989 ; pier & krolik , 1992 ) or warped thin disk ( miyoshi et al . , 1995 ; greenhill et al . , 1995 ;",
    "herrnstein , greenhill & moran , 1996 ; pringle , 1996 ; maloney , begelman & pringle , 1996 ) which hides the nucleus when viewed edge - on .",
    "our viewing angle with respect to the torus or disk is then responsible for the observed differences between narrow - line agns ( e.g seyfert 2 s ) , in which our view of the nuclear broad - line region is obscured ( edge - on view ) , and unobscured ( pole - on view ) broad - line agns ( e.g. seyfert 1 s ) .",
    "indirect evidence in support of such tori includes the discovery of broad lines in the polarized ( hence scattered ) light of seyfert 2s ( antonucci & miller , 1985 ; tran , 1995 ) , sharp - edged bi - cones of ionized gas ( e.g. , wilson & tsvetanov , 1994 ) photo - ionized by anisotropic nuclear uv radiation ( perhaps originating from the accretion disk and further collimated by the torus ) , large gas column densities ( 10@xmath8 @xmath7 ) to the nuclei of seyfert 2 s , inferred from photoelectric absorption of soft x - rays ( turner et al . , 1997 ) and strong mid - infrared emission in both seyfert types ( e.g. , antonucci , 1993 ; alonso - herrero , ward & kotilainen , 1996 ) .",
    "recent , high - resolution studies at optical and radio wavelengths have begun to provide more direct evidence for ` nuclear ' disks on size - scales ranging from the @xmath0100 - 1000-pc diameter dusty disks imaged by hst ( jaffe et al .",
    ", 1993 ; ford et al . , 1994 ; carollo et al . ,",
    "1997 ) and millimeter interferometry ( baker & scoville , 1998 ; downes & solomon , 1998 ) to pc - scale disks inferred from hi and free - free absorption studies ( mundell et al . , 1995 ; carilli et al . , 1998 ; peck & taylor , 1998 ; wilson et al . , 1998 ; taylor et al . , 1999 ;",
    "ulvestad , wrobel & carilli , 1999 ) , down to the 0.25-pc warped , edge - on , keplerian maser disk in ngc  4258 , imaged by the vlba ( miyoshi et al . , 1995 ,",
    "greenhill et al . , 1995 ; herrnstein , et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "theoretical work indicates that uv / x - ray radiation from the central engine can heat , ionize and evaporate the gas on the inner edge of the torus ( pier & voit , 1995 ; balsara & krolik , 1993 ; krolik & lepp , 1989 ) .",
    "indeed , simple strmgren sphere arguments suggest a radius for the ionized region of @xmath9 , where n@xmath10 is the number of nuclear ionizing photons per second and n@xmath11 is the electron density . recalling the typical density @xmath12 of the ionized disk in ngc  1068 ( see below ) , we expect r  @xmath0  0.3@xmath11.5  pc which is comparable to the tenths of pc to @xmath0pc - scale resolutions achievable with the vlba for nearby seyferts .",
    "recent high angular resolution vlba radio observations of the archetypal seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc  1068 , by gallimore et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , have shown that emission from one of the radio components ( ` s1 ' ) may be associated with the inner , ionized edge of the torus .",
    "this radio component has a flat or rising ( towards higher frequencies ) spectrum , suggesting it contains the agn , and a brightness temperature of up to 4 @xmath13 10@xmath14  k ; it is elongated perpendicular to the inner radio ejecta and extends over @xmath040 mas ( 3 pc )",
    ". the radiation mechanism may be free - free thermal emission ( gallimore et al . , 1997 ) , direct synchrotron emission ( roy et al . , 1998 ) or thomson scattering of a nuclear flat - spectrum synchrotron self - absorbed radio core ( itself not detected ) by the electrons at the inner edges of the torus ( gallimore et al . , 1997 ; roy et al . ,",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this discovery highlights the possibility of using the vlba to image the pc - scale disks or tori in other seyfert galaxies .",
    "however , flat - spectrum radio sources in agns often represent non - thermal synchrotron self - absorbed radio emission with a much higher brightness temperature ( @xmath1510@xmath2 k ) than is characteristic of component s1 in ngc 1068 .",
    "high resolution radio observations are thus required to distinguish between the two emission processes . in the present paper ,",
    "we report parsec - scale vlba imaging of five seyfert galaxies with flat - spectrum radio cores and hundred - pc scale , steep - spectrum , radio jets and lobes .",
    "two of these galaxies also exhibit ionization cones with sharp , straight edges and axes aligned with the radio ejecta .",
    "our goal is to determine whether the flat spectrum nuclear radio emission represents thermal emission from the accretion disk / obscuring torus or synchrotron self - absorbed emission from a compact radio core source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; sections 2 and 3 describe the sample selection , observations and reduction techniques whilst in section 4 , the results of the study are presented .",
    "section 5 discusses possible scenarios for the observed radio emission including direct non - thermal radiation from the agn , emission from supernovae or supernova remnants produced in a starburst , or thermal emission from the accretion disk .",
    "the observed brightness temperatures are discussed in the context of the ngc 1068 result and comparison is made with other types of active nuclei such as radio galaxies , radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "section 6 summarizes the conclusions . throughout",
    ", we assume h@xmath16  =  75  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 and q@xmath16  =  0.5 .",
    "the radio emission of seyfert galaxies imaged at resolutions 011@xmath18 almost always has the steep spectrum characteristic of optically thin synchrotron radiation .",
    "flat spectrum cores are rare . in order to identify galaxies that may contain radio components similar to ` s1 ' in ngc 1068 ,",
    "we have reviewed both published ( e.g. , ulvestad & wilson , 1989 , and earlier papers in this series at @xmath196 cm and @xmath1920 cm ; kukula et al .",
    ", 1995 at 3.6 cm ) and unpublished ( wilson , braatz & dressel at 3.6 cm ) vla ` a ' configuration surveys and other interferometric studies ( e.g. , roy et al . , 1994 ) . in selecting candidate galaxies for vlba observations",
    ", we used the following criteria :    @xmath20 the radio component that is coincident with the optical nucleus ( the position of which is known to @xmath21 02 accuracy ",
    "e.g. , clements , 1981 , 1983 ) , has a flat spectrum ( @xmath22 @xmath23 0.4 , s @xmath24 @xmath25 ) between 20 cm and 6 cm or 3.6 cm with the vla in ` a ' configuration .",
    "this component must also be unresolved in the vla ` a ' configuration at 2 cm and/or 3.6 cm .",
    "@xmath20 the flux density of this component exceeds 5 mjy at 3.6 cm ( for comparison , the total flux density of component ` s1 ' in ngc 1068 at this wavelength is 14 mjy ) .",
    "@xmath20 there is , in addition , extended , ` linear ' ( double , triple or jet - like ) , steep spectrum radio emission on the hundreds of parsecs  kiloparsec scales , or well - defined , optical ionization cones .",
    "the reason for this last criterion is to define the axis of ejection of the radio components and thus the expected axis of the accretion disk .",
    "we found only six ( excluding ngc 1068 ) seyfert galaxies that satisfy these three criteria in the entire sample of about 130 imaged in the ` a ' configuration .",
    "we omit one of them because of its unfavorable declination ( 44@xmath26 ) , leaving five for imaging with the vlba .",
    "these galaxies are t0109@xmath1383 , ngc  2110 , ngc  4388 , ngc  5252 and mrk  926 .",
    "the observations were obtained with the 10-element vlba ( napier et al , 1994 ) at 8.4 ghz during observing runs in 1997 and 1998 , details of which are given in table 1 .",
    "dual circular polarizations ( right & left ) were recorded for all sources , and only the parallel hands ( i.e. rr and ll ) were correlated .",
    "t0109@xmath1383 , ngc  2110 and mrk  926 were recorded with a 32-mhz bandwidth and two - bit sampling ( 8 mhz per if , 4 ifs , 2 polarizations ) and ngc  4388 and ngc  5252 were recorded with a 16-mhz bandwidth and two - bit sampling .",
    "the target sources are too weak to obtain estimates of the phase errors using standard vlbi self - calibration / imaging techniques ( e.g. walker , 1995 ) ; instead the targets were observed in phase referencing mode , in which frequent observations of a nearby bright calibrator are interleaved with target scans and used for fringe fitting , which corrects the large phase errors , delays ( phase variations as a function of frequency ) and delay rates ( phase variations as a function of time ) present in the data ( beasley & conway , 1995 ) . as described below , extending the coherence time in this way improves the signal - to - noise ratio and enables an image of the target source to be made , which can then be used as a starting model for subsequent cycles of self - calibration .",
    "target source plus phase calibrator cycle times are shown in table 1 .",
    "this method is similar to that used on smaller , connected - element arrays , such as the vla ( known as ` phase calibration ' ) , but is more problematic for vlbi due to larger and more rapidly varying phase errors .",
    "rapid changes in the troposphere at 8.4  ghz therefore require short switching times to satisfy the condition that the change in atmospheric phase be less than a radian over the switching interval , thus enabling reliable phase connection , without 2@xmath27-radian ambiguities , for successful imaging of the target source ( beasley & conway , 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , less frequent observations were made of a bright calibrator ( ` phase check ' ) source .",
    "data editing and calibration followed standard methods ( greisen & murphy , 1998 ) and used the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) ( van moorsel , kemball & greisen , 1996 ) .",
    "amplitude scales were determined from standard vlba antenna gain tables , maintained by nrao staff , and measurements of @xmath28 made throughout the run .",
    "in addition , all data for source elevations below @xmath05@xmath26 were removed , and the antennas at hancock ( hn ) , and north liberty ( nl ) were deleted from the ngc  5252 dataset as no fringes were detected to hn , and nl showed poor phase stability due to bad weather .",
    "the final phase corrections , interpolated over time , were used as a guide for additional data editing .    despite short switching times between galaxy and phase calibrator , poor tropospheric conditions and uncertainty in the target source position prevented immediate imaging of the phase - referenced target sources using all the data .",
    "observations of the ` phase check ' source were therefore used to verify the quality of the phase referencing , before applying the phase corrections to the target sources , and to provide ancillary calibration such as manual pulse calibration and amplitude calibration checks .",
    "after imaging the phase calibrator to verify that the corrections derived from fringe fitting were valid , phase , delay and rate corrections were applied to the ` check source ' , from phase calibrator scans that were adjacent in time to the check source .",
    "many baselines displayed poor phase coherence at some point in the observing run , preventing a coherent image of the source from being produced initially from the whole dataset .",
    "instead , small time ranges ( e.g. around 1 hour ) , within which the majority of antennas had less rapidly varying phases , were selected to be used in the initial stages of the imaging process .",
    "the ` check ' source , with calibration applied from the phase calibrator , was imaged for the selected small time range . the resultant image was then used as an input / starting model for subsequent cycles of self - calibration .",
    "this self - calibration process then enabled the remaining data to be fully calibrated and used to make a final image of the ` check ' source .",
    "the final structure , flux and position of each ` check ' source compared well with previously published images ( e.g. browne et al . , 1998 ; fey & charlot , 1997 ) and images produced from our data using self - calibration alone .",
    "this method provides an independent consistency check on the phase referencing , increasing our confidence in the images of the target sources .",
    "only one ` check ' source ( j0044 - 3530 ) was not successfully imaged due to insufficient data ( i.e. only 3 minutes at very low elevation ) .",
    "the target sources were then imaged using the same method , with natural and uniform data weighting .",
    "the uniformly weighted images ( with robust parameter 0 - briggs , 1995 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the naturally weighted images , with more sensitivity to extended emission , were used to derive the brightness temperature limits to possible thermal emission from the program galaxies ; these limits are @xmath030% lower than those derived from the uniformly weighted images shown in this paper .    the uncertainty in the flux scale is taken to be @xmath05% and is included in the total uncertainties in flux densities quoted in table 2 .",
    "these errors were derived by adding , in quadrature , the 5% amplitude scale error , the r.m.s .",
    "noise in the final image and the error in the gaussian fitting .",
    "the accuracy of the target source positions is dominated by the uncertainty in the position of the phase calibrators ( @xmath00.4  14 mas ; see table 1 ) .",
    "additional positional errors , due to the transfer of phase corrections from the phase calibrator to the target source , are negligible due to the promixity of each calibrator to its target source .",
    "ngc  4388 was not detected by the present vlba observations .",
    "we therefore obtained and analyzed merlin @xmath196-cm ( 4.993-ghz ) archival data for ngc  4388 , which was observed on 7th december , 1992 with six antennas .",
    "phase referencing was performed with regular observations of 1215 + 113 , interleaved throughout the observing run and 3c286 was used for flux and bandpass calibration .",
    "a flux of 7.087 jy for 3c286 was adopted , assuming a total flux density of 7.382 jy ( baars et al . , 1977 ) and correcting for merlin resolution effects .",
    "after initial gain - elevation corrections and amplitude calibration using merlin software , the data were transferred to aips for all subsequent phase and amplitude calibration , data editing and imaging .",
    "dual polarizations were recorded for a 15-mhz bandwidth , centered at 4.993 ghz , but the right circular polarization data were removed due to instrumental problems , resulting in a final image of the left circular polarization only ( figure 2 ) .",
    "five flat - spectrum - core seyferts , were observed with the vlba at 8.4 ghz .",
    "four of the five sources were detected ( t0109@xmath1383 , ngc  2110 , ngc 5252 , mrk  926 ) and show compact , unresolved cores with brightness temperatures t@xmath29 @xmath1510@xmath2 k , total luminosities at 8.4 ghz of @xmath010@xmath30 w hz@xmath17 and sizes , on average , less than 1 pc .",
    "in addition to the core emission , ngc  2110 shows extended emission which may represent the inner parts of the radio jets , and ngc  5252 may be marginally extended ( figure 1 ) .",
    "ngc  4388 is not detected with the vlba , but is detected at 5 ghz with merlin ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we find no evidence for emission ( to a 3-@xmath31 limit of t@xmath29 @xmath010@xmath32 k ) extended perpendicular to the hundred - pc scale radio emission in t0109@xmath1383 , ngc  2110 , ngc  5252 or mrk  926 , as would be expected for emission from an accretion disk , but we discuss the possibility of thermal emission from ngc  4388 ( section 5.4 ) .",
    "the measured and derived properties of each source are listed in table 2 , while more detailed properties of ngc  2110 and ngc  4388 are given in tables 3 and 4 respectively .",

    "the nuclear component m1 , has a peak brightness of 1.2 mjy beam@xmath17 which corresponds to a brightness temperature t@xmath29 @xmath15 2.4 @xmath13 10@xmath3 k at 5 ghz ( beamsize 91 @xmath13 39.5 mas , see table 4 ) .",
    "the nucleus is unresolved in the merlin data , indicating that the source size is intermediate between the merlin and vlba beam sizes .",
    "however , a combination of the merlin and vlba results with published spectral index information can further constrain the source size .",
    "earlier radio observations of ngc  4388 have found the nuclear spectrum to be flat from 1.49 ghz to 15 ghz .",
    "the spectral index was measured to be @xmath22 = 0.26 between 1.49 ghz and 4.86 ghz with a relatively large beamsize of 12 ( hummel & saikia , 1991 ) and carral et al .",
    "( 1990 ) report a flat spectrum up to 15 ghz with an upper limit to the nuclear size of 70 mas . including the vla 8.4 ghz core flux of kukula et al ( 1995 ) suggests that the spectrum of the nucleus may be very slightly inverted between 8.4 ghz and 15 ghz ( @xmath22 = 0.05 ) but within the errors it can be taken as flat .",
    "we therefore used the measured merlin 5-ghz peak flux to derive _ predicted _ vlba 8.4 ghz fluxes of the nucleus , for spectral indices of both @xmath22 = 0.0 and 0.26 , and converted these predicted fluxes to brightness temperatures , assuming the source is unresolved by the representative vlba beamsize of 2.52 @xmath13 1.46 mas .",
    "these predicted temperatures are listed in table 4 and are above the detection threshold of the vlba observations for a source size equal to or smaller than the vlba beam .",
    "the larger predicted brightness temperature , for a source size equal to the vlba beam , of t@xmath29 @xmath5 8.3 @xmath13 10@xmath32 k is , however , only 3.8 times greater than our 3-@xmath31 , vlba detection limit and so the solid angle of the source need only be 3.8 times larger than the vlba beamsize to be undetected .",
    "we therefore constrain the size of the nucleus to be @xmath45 3.7 mas ( @xmath22=0.0 ) or @xmath45 0.3 pc .",
    "sensitive , high angular resolution vlba observations at lower frequencies such as 2.3 ghz and 1.4 ghz are required to determine the actual size and structure of the nucleus in ngc  4388 .",
    "in addition to the core emission at 5 ghz , the merlin image of ngc  4388 shows a second weak component sw of the nucleus ( labelled m2 in figure 2 ) .",
    "this component is only @xmath00.25@xmath18 away from the nucleus , lying along pa @xmath0211@xmath26 with respect to the core , and should not be confused with the stronger , more distant radio component seen in previous vla images ( e.g. falcke et al , 1998 ) , which lies @xmath019 from the nucleus ( in pa @xmath0201@xmath26 ) . to establish the reality of this weak merlin component , the vla 8.4-ghz data ( published by falcke et al . , 1998 ) were re - examined .",
    "the uniformly weighted image , shown in figure 3a , has a rather elongated synthesized beam of size 07 @xmath13 022 ( pa 74@xmath26 ) , but a bridge of emission is clearly visible , connecting the two main radio components ( labelled v1 & v2 ) .",
    "a similar bridge of emission was seen in the 4.86-ghz vla image of hummel & saikia ( 1991 ) and the 8.4-ghz vla snapshot image of kukula et al .",

    "figure 3b shows a super - resolved image produced from the same vla data , with a circular synthesized beam of 022 .",
    "again the crosses mark the merlin components , and an extension of the 8.4 ghz vla emission is seen at the location of the weak merlin component m2 , further suggesting that the merlin emission is real .",
    "the super - resolved image also suggests that a well - collimated jet of emission is emanating from the core ( v1 ) along pa @xmath0210@xmath46 for @xmath015 , before changing direction at v2 .",
    "the merlin component m2 would then be an inner part of this collimated radio ejection .",

    "a key question is whether the nuclear power source in radio - quiet quasars , seyferts and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies is a compact starburst or accretion onto a supermassive black hole . whilst emission from hot stars in the torus might account for the featureless continua in seyfert 2 s ( fernandes & terlevich 1995 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) , it seems that starbursts can not provide the necessary collimation to produce radio jets .",

    "although some seyferts are now known to possess strikingly collimated jets ( e.g. , nagar et al . , 1999",
    "; kukula et al . , 1999 ) , the resolution of the radio images is often insufficient to demonstrate the high degree of collimation seen in radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars .",

    "the brightness temperature of such a region can not exceed 10@xmath56 k at @xmath71 1 ghz ( condon , 1992 ) and so the high brightnesses of our seyfert nuclei , along with their sub - pc sizes rule out a starburst origin for the radio emission .",
    "in fact , these seyfert nuclei show similar brightness temperatures to some radio - quiet quasars ( blundell & beasley , 1998 ) and liners ( falcke et al . , 1999 ) , which are also argued to be non - thermal emission from black - hole powered central engines rather than compact starbursts . in ngc  4388 , the well - collimated radio jet also suggests the presence of an agn , despite the lack of an unresolved , high brightness nucleus .",
    "we can also rule out individual or a collection of extremely bright radio supernovae ( rsn ) as an explanation for the seyfert core emission . although these rare , bright rsn , of the kind observed in ngc  891 ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1986 ) , designated sn1986j and classified as an unusual type ii radio supernova ( weiler , panagia & sramek , 1990 ) , can display high brightness temperatures at the peak of their light curves ( e.g. 10@xmath72 k at @xmath196 cm at the peak of the sn1986j light curve ) , their fluxes increase and decrease over a timescale of a few years .",
    "the @xmath196-cm flux of sn1986j doubled in approximately three years and halved again over the following three years .",
    "measured vla fluxes for our seyfert cores have typically varied by less than 30% over @xmath010 years and are therefore inconsistent with an rsn interpretation .",
    "in addition , the _ maximum _ inferred 8.4-ghz luminosity for sn1986j of @xmath08  @xmath13  10@xmath68  w  hz@xmath17 ( calculated using the @xmath196-cm flux at the peak of the light curve , @xmath48  =  0.7 , and assuming isotropic emission at a distance of 8.96 mpc ) is somewhat lower than the luminosities of our seyfert nuclei ( table 2 ) .    we therefore conclude that the high brightness temperatures ( @xmath15 10@xmath2 k ) , small sizes ( @xmath55 1 pc ) and absence of strong flux variations over @xmath010-year timescales in t0109@xmath1383 , ngc  2110 , ngc  5252 and mrk  926 are probably indicative of synchrotron self - absorption close to a jet - producing central engine .",
    "the lower limits to the brightness temperatures do not require relativistic motions , which is consistent with the non - relativistic proper motions observed in two seyfert galaxies by ulvestad et al . , ( 1999 ) .      unlike the other four galaxies discussed in this paper , no high brightness temperature compact radio core is detected in ngc  4388 at 8.4 ghz .",
