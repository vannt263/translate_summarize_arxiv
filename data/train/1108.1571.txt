    "each pair @xmath29 with @xmath28 determines two different butterflies and thus two different charts @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the difference @xmath547 is composed by vertices at distance @xmath548 both from the boundary straight - line paths of charts @xmath549 and the diagonal paths @xmath550 in charts @xmath549 departing as in item ( 1 ) of proposition 16 from boundary vertices realizing angles of @xmath42 as in the upper right representation in figure 4 and as in figure 5 .",
    "this insures that @xmath551 grows linearly as @xmath50 increases , while @xmath552 has a quadratic growth with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "this proves that @xmath22 has asymptotically @xmath23 vertices .",
    "each one of the four @xmath10-types composing the @xmath2-type associated to a vertex of @xmath22 offer three positive integers that color the edges of a corresponding chart modeled on @xmath21 .",
    "each of these three integers colors the edges of a parallel class of edges in that chart , as was presented in our previous work , @xcite .",
    "these completes the proof of theorem 1.@xmath88    _ proof._(of theorem 2 ) now , @xmath15 must be restricted to the subfamily @xmath38 formed by the graphs @xmath164 for which @xmath50 is an odd prime .",
    "this guarantees that the charts @xmath549 are related with the tessellated graphs @xmath32 in the following way , for @xmath553 : each chart @xmath549 contains two components formed by vertices representing tmc @xmath2-types .",
    "these components are : * ( a ) * contained in a @xmath40-@xmath41-@xmath42 triangle @xmath43 ( formed by the three delimiting sa s ) ; * ( b ) * separated by the path @xmath550 in @xmath549 . the union of the two @xmath40-@xmath41-@xmath42 triangles delimited by the sa s and @xmath554 yields @xmath549",
    "there are @xmath74 charts @xmath549 , asymptotically of order @xmath17 , since each @xmath549 has asymptotically @xmath44 vertices .",
    "however , consider stripping bands of the delimiting sa s in the @xmath40-@xmath41-@xmath42 triangles having a constant euclidean width , in order to get away from any loops .",
    "this reduces the vertex number of such @xmath40-@xmath41-@xmath42 triangles in just a multiple of their perimeters , which does not influence significantly in the said asymptotic vertex number.@xmath88    99 i. j. dejter , _ tmc tetrahedral types mod 2k+1 and their structure graphs _ , graphs and combinatorics , 12 ( 1996 ) , 163 - 178 .",
