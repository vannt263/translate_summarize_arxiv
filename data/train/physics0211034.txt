    "thin foils of carbon or alminum oxide are very convenient for stripping media for h@xmath1 charge - exchange injection into a proton ring . however , two serious problems come to the fore for such mw - class proton rings as drivers of the next - generation neutron sources or neutrino factories .",
    "one is a serious degradation of the foil performance due to heating to an extremely high temperature by the energy deposit of traversing protons .",
    "the other is activation of the accelerator components by high - energy protons scattered by foil atoms @xcite .    in order to avoid these problems , stripping",
    "methods without foils have been studied from several years ago .",
    "those methods usually combine lorentz stripping and the excitation of h@xmath0 atoms by laser pumping . here",
    ", lorentz stripping means stripping an electron from an h@xmath1 ion or an h@xmath0 atom using the lorentz force that acts on charged particles with a velocity in a magnetic field @xcite .    with respect to the lorentz stripping of an h@xmath1 beam , we well know about the experiences of the psr ( proton storage ring ) at los alamos national laboratory @xcite .",
    "a two - step h@xmath0 injection scheme , that used neutralization of h@xmath1 beams by lorentz stripping for the first step , has finally been converted to direct h@xmath1 injection without lorentz stripping , because the controllability of the beam size at the foil was very low for h@xmath0 beams . since the beam size of h@xmath0 beams could not be reduced sufficiently , neither the area of the stripping foil that protons captured in the ring hit , nor the foil - hit number of the captured proton beam could be sufficiently reduced .",
    "however , there is a suggestion that the reason for the low controllability of the h@xmath0 beam size at the foil is the foil location in psr , and that perfect matching of the h@xmath0 beam to the ring optics is possible by choosing the foil location @xcite . in any case",
    ", these problems will not take place if a stripping foil is not used .",
    "in addition , when the energy of the h@xmath1 beam becomes higher , the dissociation probability of h@xmath1 ions by the lorentz force becomes higher , and the angular divergence of the h@xmath0 beam in a stripping magnet using a steep magnetic field gradient becomes smaller .",
    "therefore , if the optics of the h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 beams is carefully designed , lorentz stripping is considered to be sufficiently useful , especially for higher energy h@xmath1 beams .    with respect to the stripping of h@xmath0 beams , we know that a beam of excited h@xmath0 atoms with a principal quantum number of no less than 3 may be stripped by lorentz stripping in the same manner as a h@xmath1 beam @xcite .",
    "h@xmath0 atoms formed by lorentz stripping from h@xmath1 ions are left in the ground state .",
    "if h@xmath0 atoms of the beam can be excited to a state with a principal quantum number of no less than 3 by laser pumping , a stripping scheme without foils will be possible .",
    "thus , a three - step stripping scheme was studied first .",
    "the first step is lorentz stripping of a h@xmath1 beam to a h@xmath0 beam by a stripping magnet .",
    "the second step is pumping - up of the h@xmath0 beam to an excited state with the principal quantum number being no less than 3 , using a laser beam in a straight section of the ring .",
    "finally , the third step is again lorentz stripping of the excited h@xmath0 beam by another stripping magnet .",
    "a variety of three - step stripping schemes were reported @xcite .",
    "the major difference of these schemes are in the second step , where we must take care of the doppler broadening of the transition frequency distribution due to the momentum spread of the h@xmath0 beam .",
    "it was known from an early stage of studies on the laser stripping that there are two problems for the second step of this scheme .",
    "one problem is that , since the transition frequency shifts by the doppler effect , the transition frequency distribution spreads to as broad as @xmath2hz , according to the momentum spread , @xmath3 , of the h@xmath0 beam , which is typically @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the frequency by the angular frequency , @xmath5 , except when otherwise mentioned",
    ". the line width of the laser should be narrower than 10 mhz in order to secure a coherence time necessary to cover the flight time of light from the laser source to the end of the interaction region , which is typically on the order of 10 ns .",
    "therefore , we need to take some measure to cover the spread of transition frequency as broad as @xmath2 hz using a laser beam having a line width as narrow as 10 mhz .",
    "the other problem is that if we do not take any measure , the rate of h@xmath0 atoms that are excited in one collision between h@xmath0 and the laser beam is at most one half .",
    "this is because the probability of the absorption and the stimulated emission of a photon by a h@xmath0 atom are the same , and the population of the excited state saturates to one half .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve an efficiency near to 100% , collisions between the h@xmath0 beam and the laser must be repeated 4 or 5 times .",
    "when h@xmath0 atoms are placed in an external electric field , a potential barrier is formed due to the superposition of the coulomb potential of the proton and the external electric field .",
    "the energy levels of the h@xmath0 atoms shift due to the stark effect @xcite . as the electric field is increased , the peak energy of the potential barrier becomes lower . and as the energy level comes near to the peak of the potential barrier , the lifetime of the energy level due to field ionization becomes shorter , and the level width becomes broader .",
    "thus , the optical spectral lines fade out when the field ionization lifetime becomes comparable to the lifetime against radiation . however , the energy levels of the h@xmath0 atoms are well defined at energies near to the peak of the effective potential barrier @xcite .",
    "the reciprocal lifetimes of those energy levels become as high as @xmath6 sec@xmath7 and , accordingly , the widths may be as broad as @xmath2 hz @xcite .",
    "broadening of the level width with an increase of the electric field was experimentally observed using 800 mev h@xmath1 beams at the clinton p. anderson meson physics facility @xcite .",
    "the widths of these levels are as broad as the spread of the transition - frequency distribution , due to the momentum spread of the h@xmath0 beam , and are controllable by varying the external electric field .",
    "thus these levels were first used as a measure against the first problem mentioned above . however , these broad levels soon also turned out to be helpful as a measure against the second problem .",
    "because excited h@xmath0 atoms ionize within a very short lifetime , the population of excited h@xmath0 atoms can not increase , and therefore pumping down to the ground state by stimulated emission is negligible .",
    "thus , the ionization efficiency is expected to be 100% .",
    "the level broadened by the stark effect as broad as the spread of the transition - frequency distribution due to the momentum spread of the h@xmath0 beam is the essential element of the stripping scheme described here .",
    "therefore , for the sake of convenience , it is called the broad stark state .",
    "the frequency ( @xmath8 ) of laser in the laboratory frame is shifted to @xmath9 in the particle rest frame by the doppler effect , and @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are relativistic parameters of the particle , and @xmath13 is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the laser beam in the laboratory frame .",
    "accordingly , the wavelength shifts with the kinetic energy of the h@xmath0 beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the particle rest frame of an h@xmath0 atom ,",
    "the transition wavelength between the ground state and the state with a principal quantum number 3 is 103 nm , and a laser with this wavelength is in the ultraviolet region .",
    "however , the transition wavelength is in the color region when the h@xmath0 beam energy becomes several hundreds mev or higher .",
    "most of the beam energies of h@xmath1 charge - exchange injection into high - intensity proton rings are in this energy region . generally speaking , lasers in the color region are easier to obtain and handle than those in the ultraviolet region .",
    "this is a big advantage of the doppler effect .",
    "@xmath14(lab ) and @xmath14(prf ) are the laser wavelengths in the laboratory and the particle rest frame , respectively .",
    "* n * indicates the principal quantum number of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the dotted line indicates the transition wavelength between the ground state and the state of zero binding energy , and free means the electron is in the * free * state . ]    because the momentum spread of the h@xmath0 beam is the velocity spread of particles in the beam , the transition frequencies of the individual particles spread due to the doppler effect .",
    "the spread of the transition - frequency distribution in the particle rest frame ( @xmath15 ) is given by @xmath16 where @xmath9 is the transition frequency in the particle rest frame and @xmath3 is the momentum spread of the h@xmath0 beam in the laboratory frame .",
    "for example , when the momentum spread of a 1 gev h@xmath0 atom is @xmath4 , as a typical value , @xmath17 hz for the transition frequency between the ground state and the state with a principal quantum number of 3 .",
    "when a particle , with relativistic parameters of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , moves in a magnetic field @xmath18 in the laboratory frame , the particle is affected in the particle rest frame by an electric field ( @xmath19 ) given by @xmath20    this electric field causes the particle to experience the stark effect .",
    "therefore , by adjusting @xmath18 so that the stark level comes near to the peak of the potential barrier , a broad stark state can be formed .",
    "combining such a broad stark state and laser pumping , a new type of h@xmath1 charge - exchange injection system , like fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , becomes possible .",
    "charge - exchange injection system using an undulator and a laser pumping system .",
    "sm indicates a stripping magnet .",
    "h@xmath0 atoms formed by sm drift into the magnetic field of the undulator .",
    "then , they are pumped up to a broad stark state and decay to a proton and an electron .",
    "( b ) conceptual drawing of the stripping process .",
    "an aimed stark state of h@xmath0 ( here the state with * n * @xmath21 ) is broadened as much as the spread of the transition frequency due to the momentum spread of the h@xmath0 beam by adjusting the undulator magnetic field so that the aimed comes near to the peak of the effective potential barrier .",
    "then , h@xmath0 atoms are pumped up to the broad stark state by a narrow - band laser .",
    "formed excited h@xmath0 atoms immediately decay through autoionization . ]    in this injection system , a h@xmath1 beam is firstly converted to a h@xmath0 beam by a stripping magnet .",
    "next , the h@xmath0 beam is conducted into a magnetic field of an undulator , where a broad stark state of h@xmath0 atoms is prepared .",
    "then , the h@xmath0 atoms are pumped up from the ground state to the prepared broad stark state by a narrow - band laser beam .",
    "excited h@xmath0 atoms immediately dissociate and form a proton beam .",
    "finally , the proton beam is captured by the ring .    the stripping process of this scheme is conceptually shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "when h@xmath0 atoms come into the magnetic field of the undulator , the potential of the h@xmath0 atom is deformed to form a barrier by the electric field of the lorentz force .",
    "the magnetic field of the undulator is adjusted so that the aimed stark state comes near to the peak of the potential barrier , and is broadened as broad as the spread of the transition - frequency distribution due to the momentum spread of the h@xmath0 beam . because the level width of the state is sufficiently broad , a narrow - band laser with the same frequency as the central transition frequency can interact with all h@xmath0 atoms of the beam , although the distribution of the transition frequency is very broad due to the momentum spread . then , h@xmath0 atoms are pumped up to the broad stark state by a narrow - band laser .",
    "a narrow - band laser is necessary to secure the coherence time that should cover the flight time of light from the laser source to the end of the interaction region .",
    "excited h@xmath0 atoms immediately ionize through auto - ionization , because the ionization probability of the state is far larger than the probability of the stimulated emission of photons . therefore , the rate of pumping down to the ground state is negligible , and the reaction proceeds one - directionally from pumping up to auto - ionization .",
    "competition between pumping up and down does not occur .",
    "thus , the stripping efficiency is expected to reach 100% .",
    "the ionization cross section is given as a product of the cross section of the transition from the ground state to the excited state and the ionization rate of the excited state .",
    "in this case , the ionization rate is almost one , because the ionization probability of the excited state is very high and the ionization cross section is almost equal to the transition cross section .",
    "we now estimate the parameters of the laser and the undulator necessary to realize a stripping system for a h@xmath0 beam . with respect to the stark state of an h@xmath0 atom in an external electric field ,",
    "the variables describing the quantum state are separated in parabolic coordinates @xcite . an atomic state is completely defined by a set of quantum numbers ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the quantum number @xmath23 is the principal ( magnetic ) quantum number , @xmath24 is the quantum number of a partial wave function in a partial potential that becomes infinity at infinite distance , and @xmath25 is that in a partial potential that has a barrier and becomes negative infinity at infinite distance . also , there is the relation @xmath26 .",
    "the electric field dependence of the energy level of the h@xmath0 atom stark state with a set of quantum numbers ( @xmath22 ) is given by the following formula @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy in atomic unit ( a. u.=27.21ev ) and @xmath19 is the strength of the external electric field in atomic unit ( a. u.@xmath29v / cm ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the dependence of the energy level upon the external electric field is shown for several states of @xmath30 from 3 to 6 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . @xmath34 indicates the energy of the peak of the potential barrier .",
    "@xmath34 decreases with the electric field strength .",
    "when @xmath34 comes near a level , the decay probability of the level due to the tunneling effect increases and , accordingly , the level width broadens . as @xmath34 approaches nearer , the level width rapidly broadens .",
    "after @xmath34 comes below the level , it finally disappears .",
    "therefore , every line is terminated at the point where the level width becomes @xmath2hz . as shown in fig .",

    "the coherence time of the laser is taken to be sufficiently long to cover the flight time of light from the laser source to the end of the interaction region .",
    "however , h@xmath0 atoms see the laser as a pulse of the length of the interaction time ( @xmath54 ) in the particle rest frame .",

    ".    the loss rate of photons by reflection and diffraction in one cycle of light in the resonator may be as low as on the order of ppm in a high - finesse fp resonator .",

    "today , high power fp resonators are available which have finesses near @xmath72 and lengths of 6 m or longer , and are able to stack a 10 kw/@xmath71 light beam with a diameter of 10 mm . these fp resonators are considered to be sufficiently applicable for the laser stripping systems installed in actual accelerators .",
    "because the level width of the stark state is very broad , tuning of the laser frequency and the undulator magnetic field is rather easy .",
    "the emittance growth accompanying stripping in a magnetic field is expected to be several times the emittance of the h@xmath0 beam , but is insignificant in a situation where a ring beam with an emittance larger than 100 @xmath59mmmrad is formed from the h@xmath1 beam by sophisticated phase - space painting .",
    "this emittance growth should be taken into account as a part of beam painting .",
    "thus , a laser stripping system using a high - finesse fabry - perot resonator and an undulator magnet is considered to be sufficiently applicable to actual high - intensity proton rings as a substitute for the conventional injection system using a solid foil .",
