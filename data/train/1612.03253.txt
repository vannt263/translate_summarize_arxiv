    "topological materials are thought to be the candidates to realize fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite due to their robustness against perturbations .",
    "usually the topological character is indicated by the emergence of edge states for a bulk system .",
    "recently , there have been a great deal of work to explore topological systems related to such states @xcite . in two dimensional systems such as the bi@xmath2te@xmath3 nanoribbon , manipulation of edge state by modulating a gate voltage",
    "has been reported in experiments @xcite .",
    "similarly , for topological bi(111 ) bilayer nanoribbon , through first - principle simulations , the desirable edge state engineering can be realized by chemical decoration @xcite . besides , in one dimensional lattice systems , by coupling the atomic spin states to a laser - induced periodic zeeman field",
    ", a novel scheme is proposed to manipulate the edge state @xcite .",
    "this attracts both theoretical and experimental interests .",
    "thus manipulation to the edge state is a way to investigate topological systems .",
    "compared to traditional solid state systems , cold atoms trapped in optical lattices are excellent simulators to investigate various interesting physical topics such as topological insulators @xcite .",
    "one important reason is that such systems with tunable on - site and hopping potentials provide more controllable platforms to investigate quantum signatures of many - body systems .",
    "once such a system possesses a structure of topological material , manipulating the edge state would be feasible in light of quantum control methodology .",
    "time - dependence control to quantum systems is valid to dynamically realize specific control goals @xcite . among them , quantum lyapunov control has been investigated widely and applied to realize various kinds of objectives @xcite .",
    "it is used to design an open - loop controller by simulating the evolution for an artificial closed - loop quantum system .",
    "namely it is a ` closed - loop design and open - loop apply ' control strategy .",
    "the dynamics is governed by schrdinger equation . in this control , after determining the suitable control hamiltonian , the control fields play an important role .",
    "they are designed by making the positive lyapunov function decreases monotonously . in order to design the control fields , in this work , we employ two quantum lyapunov control schemes : state distance and state error schemes .",
    "these two schemes are so intituled since the lyapunov functions used in them are based on state distance and state error respectively .",
    "note that the control fields would vanish when the system is asymptotically steered to the target state which locates in a set specified by lasalle invariant principle @xcite .",
    "we prepare the edge state for a topological system composed of atoms loaded in an optical lattice by the quantum lyapunov control methods mentioned above .",
    "such a lattice can be created by two standing waves formed by two laser beams with different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "such a system can be described by a hamiltonian of the harper model @xcite .",
    "we assume all the cold atoms are loaded in the lowest band of the optical lattice to make the tight - binding limit available .",
    "for the open boundary lattice , the edge states emergence with eigenenergies locate apart from the energy subbands .",
    "we choose one of the edge states to prepare . then a control hamiltonian is needed .",
    "inspired by lattice shaking technique @xcite which can be applied to quantum simulators in optical lattices with tunable structures , in this work , a trigonometrical modulation control hamiltonian ( time - dependent hermitian ) is introduced with a time varying control field to prepare the edge state .    in order to indicate the validity of both control schemes , the fidelity defined by the scalar product of the controlled and goal state is adopted .",
    "we found that despite the existence of fluctuations which perturb the on - site or the hopping potentials , the fidelity can reach a high value at the terminated time .",
    "this demonstrates the robustness of both control schemes against fluctuations . to examine the generality of both control schemes ,",
    "we apply them to chains with different lengths with the same configuration(all of them are of type 3@xmath0 , @xmath1=2 @xcite ) .",
    "high fidelity control results manifest the validity of both control schemes in this work . taking the controllability for operation in experiments into account",
    ", we use amplitude - modulated control fields in place of the unmodulated ones to prepare the edge state .",
    "since the sign for the control field would be inclined to switch while its amplitude changes when fidelity approaches 1 , we choose the manipulation function to make the amplitude decrease .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we specify the model , i.e. a controlled chain made of cold atoms loaded in an one dimensional optical lattice . in section [ app ] , we exhibit the general procedure to design the control fields in two quantum lyapunov control schemes , which is exemplified with a trigonometrical modulation control hamiltonian",
    ". then we examine the control strategies in large control parameter intervals and with random initial states . in section",
    "[ discussions ] , we explore the robustness of the two control schemes against the number and amplitudes of on - site energy and hopping fluctuations , application to chains of 3@xmath0 configuration with different lengths and a feasible modulation for the control fields . finally , we conclude in section [ sum ] .",
    "in this work we consider a system made of cold atoms trapped in an one dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the lattice of straight line shape can be generated by superimposing two standing waves of laser beams with different wavelengths .",
    "first we show the procedure to obtain the fermionic chain from single particle hamiltonian , which has the following form in the periodically modulated lattice @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the lattice depth and wavenumbers respectively .",

    "we choose @xmath30 , then the chain has a 3@xmath0 configuration : @xmath31 here means the number of eigenenergies in a energy subband since the total energy band can be divided into @xmath23 subbands in harper model @xcite and we choose @xmath1=2 in this work . ` 3 ' reflects the periodic character for the chain which results from the ratio of the two wave vectors of the two lasers . `",

    "the edge states for the chain locate near the ends .",
    "the hopping strength between the two ends ( denoted by @xmath40 ) would affect the energy spectrum of the chain while the chain can be mapped to a ring mathematically without changing the periodic character in the bulk .",

    "the isolated states include the edge states belonging to topological phases . besides the edge states , the other isolated ones are just located in the gap since the eigenstates are orthogonal to each other .",

    "<S> quantum lyapunov control uses a feedback control methodology to determine control fields which are applied to control quantum systems in an open - loop way . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we adopt two lyapunov control schemes to prepare an edge state for a fermionic chain consisted of cold atoms loaded in an optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> such a chain can be described by the harper model . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to the two schemes , state distance and state error lyapunov functions are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that both the schemes are effective to prepare the edge state within a wide range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the edge state can be prepared with high fidelity even * if * there are moderate fluctuations in on - site or hopping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> both control schemes can be extended to similar chains ( 3@xmath0 , @xmath1=2 ) of different lengths . </S>",
    "<S> since regular amplitude control field is easier to apply in practice , amplitude - modulated control fields are used to replace the unmodulated one to prepare the edge state . </S>",
    "<S> such control approaches provide tools to explore edge states for one dimensional topological materials . </S>"
