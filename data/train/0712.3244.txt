    "the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials have attracted a lot of attention of the condensed matter community owing to their spectacular insulator - metal transition with magnetic field .",
    "ferromagnetic a@xmath2b@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( a = rare earth , b = alkaline earth ) exhibits cmr properties at particular concentrations of @xmath5 in their respective phase diagrams .",
    "half - metallicity ( hm ) has been observed in a few of these compounds both theoretically and experimentally@xcite . in case of half - metals one of the spin bands ( generally the majority band )",
    "is conducting whereas the other band ( generally the minority band ) is insulating at the fermi level ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this facilitates 100% spin polarization .",
    "this property of the half - metals make them potential candidates for application in spintronic devises and magnetic sensors .",
    "the cmr effect along with high spin polarization add to the technological importance of the cmr manganites .",
    "apart from their great potential in technology , the strong interplay of the spin , orbital and charge degrees of freedom of the charge carriers involved in this insulator - metal transition , holds out a promise for rich physics .    in this paper",
    "we have done a first principle tight binding- linearized muffin tin orbital ( tb - lmto)@xcite calculation of the end - point compositions of and with @xmath0 doping .",
    "for we have done the calculation with local spin density approximation ( lsda ) . for and we had to incorporate the electron - electron correlation ( lsda+u ) to account for the band gap in and to match our results with the available spectroscopic data . moreover , the charge and orbital order observed in doped manganites also merits a lsda+u treatment in order to account for the intra - shell ( d and f ) coulomb interaction@xcite .",
    "all the three calculations have been done with vosko - ceperley - alder parametrization for the exchange correlation energy and potential .",
    "we have included langreth - mehl - hu gradient corrections to the exchange correlation .",
    "the k - mesh used for all these self - consistent calculations was 10@xmath710@xmath710 .",
    "although , can take both cubic as well as hexagonal structures@xcite , here we have considered only the cubic ( distorted ) polymorph of this perovskite since our main motivation is to study the hm in .",
    "we have also compared the band structure results of with the end - point compounds .",
    "crystal structure of the system is taken from a published neutron diffraction data .",
    "for we have taken the same structure as with one pr atom replaced by a di - valent sr .",
    "electron - lattice coupling ( elc ) has a very important role in the physics of manganites .",
    "they show up in two ways .",
    "first is the so called `` tolerance factor''@xcite involving the static effect of crystal structure on electron hopping , which has a direct effect on conductivity .",
    "the atomic size difference between the rare - earth atoms and the divalent dopants results in an internal stress which effects the mn - o - mn bonds .",
    "the electron hopping between the mn sites is inversely proportional to the compression of the mn - o - mn bonds .",
    "this type of elc of has been taken in to account in our calculations .",
    "the importance of different jahn - teller modes and polarons in accounting the proper insulating a - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state of undoped lamno@xmath8 has been dealt by several groups@xcite . the second type of elc is the dynamic elc which couples the lattice vibration ( phonons ) with electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "since tb - lmto calculations are based on adiabatic approximation which decouples the electronic and the lattice degrees of freedom@xcite , accounting for the dynamic elc is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "band structure calculations can provide only a qualitative description of any system as the structural complications that exist in real systems are difficult to accommodate in a calculation .",
    "although , we assume proper stoichiometry , cation vacancy and oxygen - non stoichiometry are a common in real systems . again in we have assumed the crystal structure of",
    "the effect of pr / sr disorder and local strains and relaxations have not been taken into account .",
    "but still our prediction of hm in is robust enough to merit attention .    [ [ section ] ]",
    "cubic has a g - type afm ground state with a lattice parameter@xcite of @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "our calculations with different magnetic configurations have shown that this g - type afm state turns out be the most stable , in agreement with earlier reports@xcite . in this work",
    "we have used only the g - type afm structure .",
    "results of our tb - lmto ( lsda ) calculations are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the total and site projected density of states ( pdos ) clearly reveals a band gap of @xmath11 ev which is similar to that obtained by other band structure calculations@xcite on this system .",
    "the near @xmath6 states are dominated by mn @xmath12 and o @xmath13 . the near @xmath6 valance band shows a strong mn @xmath12 - o @xmath13 hybridization . although , sr states have a very little presence near @xmath6 , they appear to be hybridized with the significant o states throughout the valence band .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the conduction states are dominated mainly by mn .",
    "we have estimated the magnetic moment of individual mn atom to be @xmath14 @xmath15 which is again similar to @xmath16 @xmath15 obtained by calculations using the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite . this value of the magnetic moment , which is lower compared to that of free mn@xmath17 ion ( 3 @xmath15 , neglecting the orbital contribution ) , indicate the strong hybridization of the mn and o states in cubic .",
    "it should be noted that the shape of the o pdos and the mn pdos near e@xmath18 have striking similarities , which hints to a strong covalent bonding .",
    "this inference is supported by the crystal orbital hamiltonian population ( coph ) analysis done by rune sondena et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    lsda@xmath19u band - structure calculations for were done for the a - type afm phase using the crystal structure ( space group : pbnm(62 ) ) taken from a neutron diffraction result@xcite published earlier .",
    "the lsda@xmath19u method was employed mainly to account for the strong electron correlation which is behind the insulating nature of this material@xcite . unlike in lamno@xmath4 where simple lsda can reproduce",
    "the band gap , in the lsda@xmath19u treatment is essential to derive a realistic value of the gap . in our calculation , we have taken the exchange term @xmath20 and the correlation term @xmath21 for pr @xmath22 state to be @xmath23 ev and @xmath24 ev respectively and those for mn @xmath12 to be @xmath25 ev and @xmath26 ev respectively .",
    "2 shows the spin resolved total and site projected density of states of .",
    "our lsda@xmath19u calculation shows an insulating a - type afm ground state for .",
    "we have estimated the band gap to be @xmath27 ev . here ,",
    "the electron - electron correlation that has been incorporated , was found to be crucially important for obtaining the band gap . a simple lsda calculation of this system does not give an insulating ground state .",
    "further , the lsda calculation results in the pr @xmath22 states appearing very close to the @xmath6 , contrary to the photoemission spectroscopic results showing these states to be @xmath28 ev below the e@xmath18 .",
    "lsda+@xmath21 calculation enables us to fix this problem to certain extent .",
    "the pr states have hardly any presence near e@xmath18 .",
    "the near e@xmath18 pdos of mn and o1/o2 makes an interesting study .",
    "though , the mn and o1/o2 states are hybridized near e@xmath18 , here this hybridization is not as strong as in the cubic srmno@xmath8 .",
    "moreover , in this system , the hybridization between mn and o2 is certainly stronger than that between mn and o1 , owing to greater physical proximity of mn with o2 than o1 . here",
    ", the degree of covalency of mn - o2 bond is certainly less than that we saw in cubic srmno@xmath8 .",
    "another interesting observation is that , the hybridization of mn 3d and the o1/o2 ( 2p ) states are clearly spin dependent .",
    "while there is a considerable hybridization in the majority band , both types of oxygen atoms hardly have any significant weight in the minority band indicting a strong spin dependence to the mn - o1/o2 hybridization . here the magnetic moment of individual mn atom in is @xmath29 @xmath15 which is comparable to the magnetic moment of free mn@xmath30 , neglecting the orbital contribution .",
    "this suggests a strong atomic like moment of mn in and a relatively weak hybridization compared to that in .",
    "the magnetic moment of o1 atom is @xmath31 @xmath15 and that of o2 atom is @xmath32 @xmath15 .",
    "the relatively higher magnetic moment of o2 atom could be due to its proximity with the mn atom .",
    "the band - structure calculation ( lsda@xmath19u ) on were done for the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the crystal structure that we have used for super - cell calculation is that of the parent compound prmno@xmath4 .",
    "we have substituted one of the pr atoms with a sr atom in the four formula unit cell . the exchange term @xmath20 and the correlation term @xmath21 for pr @xmath22 and mn @xmath12 are the same as those used for . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the calculated total and site projected density of states of pr@xmath33sr@xmath34mno@xmath8 .",
    "we have chosen this composition in order to study the ferromagnetic metallic ground state of at this doping . also , this particular composition is easy to handle in the lsda@xmath19u",
    ". a comparison of our results with the results from photoemission experiments on a close composition in ferromagnetic metallic phase can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "there is a qualitative matching between our band structure results and the spectroscopic data .",
    "the most prominent effect of substituting one of the pr with sr is the appearance of a finite dos at @xmath6 in the majority band of the total spin polarized dos , while the minority band display a wide gap insulating behavior .",
    "the band gap in the minority band is 2.8 ev .",
    "appearance of this metallicity upon 25% sr doping is consistent with the phase diagram reported earlier@xcite .",
    "we will discuss the half - metallicity upon sr doping by comparing these results with those from the end - point compounds , especially with .    since our focus is on hm , we will concentrate on the states near e@xmath18 .",
    "the pr / sr states have hardly any role near e@xmath18 .",
    "the sr pdos in , though not significant , has a larger band width in the valance band compared to that found in .",
    "this could be because of the sr acting more like an impurity atom .",
    "pr pdos in the majority band shows a certain degree of hybridization with the o1 atom near @xmath35 ev below the @xmath6 .",
    "the near e@xmath18 states here also are dominated by the mn and o. from the mn and o pdos , it is quite clear that there is a strong hybridization between the mn @xmath12 and the o @xmath13 states which is spin dependent . here",
    "both the o1 and o2 hybridization with the mn are stronger than the undoped in the majority band .",
    "the o1 @xmath13 shows the same degree of hybridization at e@xmath18 as that of o2 @xmath13 states , which was not the case in .",
    "we attribute this significant change to sr doping . comparing the shape of o1 and o2 with those of the mn sates in the majority band , we conjecture that sr doping in increases the degree of covalency between the mn @xmath12 and o1/o2 @xmath13 states .",
    "consequently , the gap in the majority band is filled up and gives rise to metallicity . whereas , in the minority band both the mn and o1/o2 states are pushed further apart from the e@xmath18 giving rise to a band gap of @xmath1 ev .",
    "the calculated magnetic moment of individual mn atom in is @xmath36 @xmath15 , which is less than that of mn atom in , again suggesting a increased hybridization activity .",
    "simultaneously , the magnetic moment of o1 and o2 in also increases slightly ( by @xmath37 @xmath15 ) validating our conjecture of increased hybridization activity upon sr doping .",
    "the individual mn atoms of loose approximately 0.05e charge compared to the mn atoms of .",
    "this is due to the majority e@xmath38 electrons which fill up the band gap in the majority band as a result of the hybridization of mn with o states .",
    "the total magnetic moment of the super cell is 15 @xmath15 .",
    "the integral magnetic moment is the signature of the resulting hm .",
    "the magnetic moment of mn@xmath39 atom is 3.886 @xmath15 and that of mn@xmath40 is 3.878 @xmath15 .",
    "the difference in charge between the two types of mn are 0.002e .",
    "this shows that the difference in charge and magnetic moment between the two inequivalent mn atoms are insignificant .",
    "there is hardly any difference between the two types of mn sites in their spin projected pdos , with both types of mn atoms contributing to the near e@xmath18 minority band .",
    "pickett et .",
    "al . @xcite have tried to explain the hm as an effect of the a / b local environment disorder , creating a variation in the mn @xmath41 site energy which in turn induces localization effects in the near e@xmath18 minority band making it non - conducting .",
    "this does not seem to be the case from our study .",
    "we think the spin - dependent hybridization of mn @xmath12 and o @xmath13 which was present in the is further strengthened upon hole ( sr ) doping and this is responsible for hm in .",
    "the hm character also can account for the high resistivity at zero field . since only single spin band can participate in the conductivity process ,",
    "electron hopping between ferromagnetic regions with opposite directions of magnetization become negligible leading to high resistivity . here , the scattering process will not randomize the direction of propagation of the electron as would have been the case for random potential ( spin ) arrangement . here",
    "the electron would suffer a barrier reflection due to the ferromagnetic regions of opposite magnetization .",
    "this effect is further accentuated in case of hm ( compared to other systems like magnetic multilayers ) , as there is no minority conduction .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied forcing the different ferromagnetic regions to align along the magnetic field , there appears a sharp drop in resistivity .",
    "this strong insulating behaviour at zero field and subsequent melting of different ferromagnetic regions on application of magnetic field could contribute substantially to the large negative magnetoresistance .",
    "we have studied the with @xmath0 using a first principle band structure calculation method of lsda@xmath19u .",
    "our calculations show that the cmr system has a half - metallic character with a band gap of @xmath1 ev in the minority band .",
