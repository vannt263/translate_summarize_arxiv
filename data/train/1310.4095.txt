    "quantum control is one of the main research subject of the modern physics . a quantum control problem consists to find how vary the external parameters ( as for example parameters of strong laser fields ) in order to a quantum system ( a spin , an atom or a molecule ) evolves to a predetermined target state satisfying the control goal .",
    "such problems can present very important applications in different fields : nanosciences ( to drive molecular machines ) , quantum information ( to perform quantum logic gates ) , and physical chemistry ( to perform vibrational cooling , to control chemical reactions ) .",
    "if the target state is an eigenstate of the quantum system , an adiabatic approach @xcite is a good strategy to solve quantum control problems , since external parameters are usually slowly varied with respect to the response of the quantum system and since the adiabatic approximation predicts that the wave function remains projected onto an eigenstate during the dynamics .",
    "adiabatic schemes of quantum control have been proposed for quantum computation by holonomic approaches @xcite or by quantum annealing @xcite , and for atomic control by strong laser fields @xcite .",

    "the system and the environment are entangled and the dynamics can be characterized by decoherence processes . the goal of the present paper is the characterization of these defects .",
    "some adiabatic quantum control methods are based on geometric approaches ( geometry of fiber bundles @xcite or topology of eigensurfaces @xcite ) .",
    "we want a geometric characterization of the defects induced by the entanglement .",
    "recently , we have proposed a generalization of the geometric phase concept for open and composite quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this geometric phase takes its values in the @xmath0-algebra of the operators of the quantum system .",
    "in contrast with the usual geometric phase which is associated with a simple gauge theory @xcite , the @xmath0-geometric phase is associated with an higher gauge theory ( a generalization of gauge theory into a category theory context , see for example @xcite ) .",

    "the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) is a solution of a quantum control problem consisting to change the state of a three level atom from the bound state to an excited state by passing through a `` dark '' state , by using two laser gaussian pulses .",

    "it can signify the large environment of an open quantum system as for the discussion section 5 , or it can signify the ( small ) second part of a bipartite quantum system as for the example treated section 4 .",
    "we focus on the effect of the entanglement on the control .",
    "we have chosen an example with a small environment ( bipartite quantum system ) in order to avoid the possible effects of the dissipation induced by large environments and enlighten the effects associated only with the entanglement .",

    "the average curving is a measure of the `` kinematic decoherence '' associated with variations of the entropy and of the entanglement between the system and the environment .",
    "it is essentially induced by the non - adiabaticity of the environment . in the example",
    "treated in this paper ( the stirap system ) , it is zero for some invertible eigenmatrices .",
    "this seems to be the signature that the non - adiabaticities of the environment do not induce increases of the entanglement and of the entropy in these cases .",
    "but in these cases , the curving does not play its second role which consists to `` kill '' the inactive singularities in the fake curvature .",
    "finally the von neumann entropy of the eigenmatrice measures the `` local decoherence '' induced by the `` non - dynamical '' entanglement of the system with the environment appearing directly at the level of the eigenstates of the universe .",
    "+ the method consisting to draw the densities of the different field strengths is able to interpret the hampering by entanglement on the adiabatic quantum control .",
    "it is also able to distinguish in the geometric representation of the universe dynamics , the non - adiabatic effects concerning the system from the decoherence effects associated with the environment .",
    "the study of the adiabatic fields can then be a tool to establish adiabatic control strategies for a system in contact with an environment .",
    "but as we can see for the example treated in the present paper ( the stirap system entangled with another stirap system ) , it can be very difficult to completely avoid the decoherence regions ( especially if an `` entropic string '' split into two parts the control manifold as it is the case for the example with a static coupling ) .",
