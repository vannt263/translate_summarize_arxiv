    "it is now generally accepted that the lobes of powerful radio galaxies are fuelled by two oppositely directed relativistic beams emitted from the nucleus . by comparing the power supplied by the beams with the power radiated by the radio components , scheuer ( 1974 ) showed that only a small fraction of the power supplied can be radiated away from the tip of the beam , and that most of the energy must be deposited in a cavity surrounding the beam .",
    "the dynamics of this cavity ( or `` cocoon '' as it is sometimes called ) and its interaction with the external medium have been extensively discussed ( e.g. scheuer 1974 ; begelman & cioffi 1989 ; kaiser & alexander 1997 , 1999 ; heinz , reynolds & begelman 1998 ; alexander 2000 ; reynolds , heinz & begelman 2001 ) .    in order to derive basic properties of the cavity , such as its pressure and expansion velocity , previous workers have had to use the synchrotron radio emission , often assuming equipartition of energy between magnetic fields and relativistic particles . there is no guarantee that this is the case and there may be other sources of pressure in the cavity , such as low energy cosmic rays or diffuse hot gas . a more direct probe of the properties of the cavity could be achieved if thermal emission from the shock driven by the overpressured cavity into the surrounding gas could be observed .    in this paper",
    ", we deduce the presence and properties of the cavity and its external ( bow ) shock from chandra x - ray observations of the thermal emission associated with the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a. deficits of x - ray emission coincident with the inner radio lobes of cyg a were first found by carilli , perley & harris ( 1994 ) from rosat observations .",
    "however , rosat did not have the spatial or spectral resolution to derive the detailed morphology or gas temperatures in the vicinity of the cavity .",
    "the presence of a bow shock ahead of radio hot spot b of cyg a was inferred by carilli , perley & dreher ( 1988 ) from measurements of faraday rotation .    in the present paper , section 2 reviews the chandra observations , while section 3 derives various properties of the expanding cavity and the shock driven into the intracluster medium .",
    "section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the chandra observations of cyg a have been described in our earlier papers ( wilson et al .",
    "2000 ; young et al . 2002 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter paper iii ) . for consistency with most recent discussions of the topic of this paper",
    ", we use h@xmath3 = 75 km s@xmath0 mpc@xmath0 and q@xmath3 = 0 ( unlike papers i  iii which assumed h@xmath3 = 50 km s@xmath0 mpc@xmath0 and q@xmath3 = 0 ) . the luminosity distance to cyg a is then d@xmath4 = 231 mpc and the angular size distance d@xmath5 = 207 mpc , so 1@xmath6 corresponds to 1.0 kpc .",
    "preliminary remarks on chandra observations of the cavity have been presented in conference proceedings ( wilson et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .    for illustration purposes , fig .",
    "1 shows the chandra image of cyg a. the elliptical shaped morphology is interpreted in terms of hot gas swept up by the cavity .",
    "2 shows 6 cm vla radio contours superposed on the x - ray grey scale .",
    "it can be seen that the radio lobes are associated with relatively faint x - ray emission and project inside the limb - brightened edge of the cavity , both of which are in accord with expectation .",
    "in paper iii , we deprojected the x - ray spectra of the intracluster gas around cygnus a taken from 12 elliptical and circular annuli outside the cavity in order to derive the run of temperature , metallicity , density and pressure as a function of radius .",
    "the goal was to derive the ambient values of the parameters presumed unaffected by the energy input by cygnus a itself .",
    "the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas was found to drop from @xmath7 8 kev more than @xmath7 80 kpc from the center to @xmath7 5 kev some 50 kpc from the center , with the coolest gas immediately outside the cavity .",
    "since this work was published , improved response functions ( `` fefs '' ) have become available .",
    "we have , therefore , deprojected each cluster shell and modelled each one with a single temperature mekal plus foreground emission , absorbed by a column of cold gas , precisely as done in paper iii but using the new fefs .",
    "such a model provides an acceptable fit to the spectra of all 12 shells , and gives small changes in the run of parameters with radius compared with the results presented in paper iii .",
    "in particular , the ( deprojected ) temperature in the innermost shell , just outside the cavity , is now @xmath8 = 4.60 @xmath9 0.5 kev , consistent with the value of 4.91 @xmath9 0.6 kev given in table 4 of paper iii .",
    "3 shows the cavity with areas emitting bright x - ray emission outlined .",
    "the updated temperatures of mekal models are indicated .",
    "these regions are so bright that projection of foreground and background cluster emission onto them is negligible . in fig .",
    "3 , regions with temperature @xmath10 5 kev are outlined , and the temperature labelled , in blue , while red is used for regions with temperatures @xmath11 5 kev .",
    "it is immediately noteable that the four regions projecting along the n and s edges of the cavity are hot ( 5.2  6.8 kev ) , while those in the `` belts '' crossing the cavity and the nucleus of the galaxy from ne to sw are cool ( 3.8  4.4 kev ) .",
    "the `` belts '' ( which are not discussed in this paper ) appear to be a disklike structure of cooling gas , seen obliquely and being accreted into the galaxy .",
    "this cooling gas may form the outer part of the accretion disk which fuels the nuclear activity .",
    "we interpret the hot regions elongated along the n and s edges of the cavity as intracluster gas shocked by the expanding cavity .",
    "the fact that these hot regions are visible at all implies that the stand - off distance of the shock is comparable to or larger than chandra s resolution ( about 1 kpc ) .",
    "the deprojected temperature of the innermost shell of the cluster , @xmath8 = 4.60 kev , is taken as the pre - shock temperature .",
    "the average temperature ",
    "@xmath12 = 6.01 kev  of the four `` blue '' regions on the n and s edges of the cavity is assumed to be representative of the postshock temperature .    for a nonradiating shock , equations ( 10 - 19 ) and ( 10 - 20 ) of spitzer ( 1978 ) are    @xmath13    and    @xmath14    where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) represent the pre - shock ( post - shock ) pressure , velocity and density",
    ", @xmath21 is the ratio of the specific heats and @xmath22 the mach number .",
    "we have assumed that the magnetic field exterior to the cavity is sufficiently weak that it does not affect the dynamics . from these equations ,",
    "the ratio of the post - shock ( @xmath23 ) to pre - shock ( @xmath24 ) temperatures is    @xmath25[(\\gamma - 1 ) + ( 2/m^{2})]}{(\\gamma + 1)^2}.\\eqno(3)\\ ] ]    equation ( 3 ) can be inverted to a quadratic equation in @xmath26 .",
    "putting @xmath21 = 5/3 , @xmath23 = 6.01 kev , and @xmath24 = 4.60 kev , we thus find the mach number of the shock driven by the expanding cavity to be @xmath22 = 1.32 .",
    "we note in passing that alexander & pooley ( 1996 ) also concluded that the hot spot advance speed is only mildly supersonic ( @xmath22 @xmath27 2 ) on completely different grounds .",
    "the thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity depends only weakly on temperature ( @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 ) .",
    "we can thus use the jump in emissivity at the limb - brightened edge of the cavity ( a factor of @xmath7 3.1 in p.a . 30@xmath31 ",
    "40@xmath31 from the nucleus ) to make a semi - independent estimate of @xmath22 .",
    "we find a density ratio @xmath32 @xmath7 0.67 , and a mach number @xmath22 @xmath7 1.3 ( equation 2 ) .",
    "however , within the uncertainties of both methods , it is possible that cyg a is simply expanding at the sound speed of the external intracluster gas .",
    "we shall , nevertheless , continue to assume @xmath22 = 1.3 in the calculations that follow .",
    "both methods have their uncertainties from measurements , deprojections and the simple analytical model , but the excellent agreement between the two is encouraging .    the shock velocity may now be found from the relation ( spitzer 1978 , equation 10 - 21 )    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the mean mass per particle and @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "assuming the above values for @xmath21 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 , and that @xmath34 = 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath36 gm , we find @xmath17 = 1,460 km s@xmath0 .",
    "all values derived so far are independent of the hubble constant . because we have used gas with a range of azimuthal angles around the cavity to derive this shock velocity ( at least in the `` temperature method '' ) , we will take @xmath17 = 1,460 km s@xmath0 as an approximation to the angle - averaged velocity of the shock driven by the expanding cavity .",
    "the total kinetic power of the expanding cavity is    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the total area of the shock surface .",
    "we assume this surface has a prolate spheroidal shape , with major axis in the plane of the sky . from the x - ray image",
    ", we adopt a semi - major axis of a = 62@xmath6 and a semi - minor axis of b = 28@xmath6 and find @xmath38 = 1.7 @xmath1 10@xmath39 @xmath40 . from the deprojection of the cluster emission , the density of the innermost cluster shell , which we take to be the pre - shock density , is @xmath19 = 4.4 @xmath1 10@xmath41 gm @xmath42 . with @xmath17 = 1,460 km s@xmath0",
    ", we have @xmath43 @xmath7 1.2 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath0 . for a black hole mass of ( 2.5 @xmath9 0.7 ) @xmath1 10@xmath44 m@xmath45 ( tadhunter et al .",
    "2003 ) , @xmath46 is 0.037 .",
    "@xmath43 exceeds the total radio emission of cyg a ( @xmath47(10 mhz  400 ghz ) = 9.0 @xmath1 10@xmath48 erg s@xmath0 ) and the total cluster gas x - ray emission in the 2 to 10 kev band ( @xmath49(2  10 kev ) = 1.2 @xmath1 10@xmath50 erg s@xmath0 .",
    "these values are from carilli & barthel ( 1996 ) adjusted to our assumed luminosity distance .",
    "the dominant current power source in cyg a thus appears to be the expansion of the jet - driven cavity which heats the surrounding intracluster gas .",
    "@xmath43 represents a lower limit to the current power of the two jets .",
    "we assume the cavity maintains its axial ratio ( @xmath51 @xmath7 2.2 ) as it expands .",
    "the shock velocity along the minor axis would then be approximately @xmath52 @xmath7 @xmath53@xmath17 = 992 km s@xmath0 and along the major axis @xmath54 @xmath7 @xmath55@xmath17 = 2,150 km s@xmath0 .",
    "assuming these velocities represent the velocities of expansion of the cavity and have been constant over the lifetime of the radio source , the age of cyg a is t@xmath56 @xmath7 3.0 @xmath1 10@xmath57 yrs .",
    "this value is within a factor of two of other estimates of the age based on the radio properties ( e.g. begelman & cioffi 1989 ; carilli et al .",
    "1991 ; kaiser & alexander 1999 ) .",
    "we emphasise that any net infall ( `` cooling flow '' or gravitational infall ) of the pre - shock gas has been assumed to be zero here , as we have no way of determining it .",
    "the cooling timescale of the hot , postshock gas , with @xmath20 @xmath7 6.5 @xmath1 10@xmath41 gm @xmath42 and @xmath23 @xmath7 7.0 @xmath1 10@xmath57 k , is t@xmath58 @xmath7 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath59 yrs .",
    "this is a factor of 8 times larger than the age of cyg a. thus , the expanding cavity is currently heating up the surrounding gas ; cooling of the gas is a slower process .",
    "this finding that t@xmath58 @xmath10 t@xmath56 supports our assumption of a nonradiating shock .    the lateral expansion of the cavity is driven by its internal pressure ( scheuer 1974 ) :    @xmath60    with the values given above for @xmath19 and @xmath52 , we have @xmath61 @xmath7 4.4 @xmath1 10@xmath62 dyne @xmath63 . if this pressure is produced by ( tangled ) magnetic fields and isotropic relativistic particles ( so @xmath61 = @xmath64 ) in equipartition , the magnetic field in the cavity is @xmath65 @xmath7 1.2 @xmath1 10@xmath66 gauss .",
    "this value is close to the equipartition magnetic field strength in the lobes calculated from their radio emission ( 6 @xmath1 10@xmath67 gauss for our distance , winter et al .",
    "1980 ; ( 4.5  6.5 ) @xmath1 10@xmath67 gauss , carilli et al . 1991 ; ( 5  7 ) @xmath1 10@xmath67 gauss , alexander & pooley 1996 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between our value of @xmath65 and that obtained from the radio observations may not be as significant as it seems given the uncertainties in both estimates .",
    "we note , in addition , that all the equipartition field strengths in the lobes quoted above assumed equal energy densities in positive particles and electrons ( c. carilli , p. alexander , private communications ) .",
    "if it is assumed , instead , that the positive particles have 100 times the energy density of the electrons ( as is the case in our galaxy ) , then the equipartition field strengths would be 3.7 times larger and the pressure in cosmic rays and magnetic fields 14 times larger .",
    "such a pressure is larger than deduced above from equation ( 6 ) , so we do not favor the notion that the energy density in positive particles is 100 times that in electrons , but we can not rule it out .",
    "we have found the shock velocity along the major axis of the cavity to be @xmath54 @xmath7 2,150 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this agrees well with the hot spot advance speed of 1,500 km s@xmath0 found by alexander & pooley ( 1996 ) , assuming ram pressure confinement and that the whole front surface of the radio source moves forward with the same speed .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the dynamics of the cavity ( or `` cocoon '' ) associated with cygnus a. the primary source of information was chandra x - ray imaging and spectroscopy , from which densities and temperatures of the thermal gas in the intracluster gas around the cavity were obtained .",
    "our primary assumption is that the hotter ( 6.0 kev ) gas in the limb - brightened regions at the n and s edges of the cavity has been shocked by the expanding cavity . from this assumption ,",
    "we infer the mach number ( 1.3 ) and velocity ( 1,460 km s@xmath0 ) of the shock .",
    "the same numbers are found from the density jump .",
    "if , instead , some of this gas has not been shocked , we will have underestimated the postshock temperature and thus also the mach number , expansion velocity and power of the expanding cavity .",
    "the kinetic power of the expanding cavity ( @xmath7 1.2 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath0 ) exceeds the total radio emission in the 10 mhz to 400 ghz band by a factor of @xmath7 13 and the total x - ray emission from the cluster in the 2  10 kev band by a factor of @xmath7 10 .",
    "the cooling time of the shocked gas ( 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath59 yrs ) is longer than the age of the radio source by a factor of @xmath7 8 .",
    "it thus appears that most of the power currently emitted in the relativistic beams which fuel the radio source goes into heating the intracluster medium .",
    "we find that the pressure inside the cavity ( 4.4 @xmath1 10@xmath62 dynes @xmath63 ) exceeds the minimum pressure in magnetic fields and cosmic rays in the radio lobes .",
    "this difference may not be significant , so we find no conclusive evidence for any other entity contributing pressure inside the cavity .",
    "a further consequence is that the ratio of the energy density in positive relativistic particles to that in relativistic electrons in cyg a is less than the value of 100 found in our galaxy .",
    "if the cavity shock is weak ( @xmath22 = 1.3 ) in a powerful , young radio galaxy like cyg a , then it seems that , in general , heating of the intracluster medium by radio galaxies must be through the media of weak shocks and sound waves .",
    "strong shocks are implausible ( cf .",
    "heinz 2003 ) .",
    "the accuracy of our results is limited by the simplified analytical model used .",
    "further work , combining the results of the x - ray observations with modern computational simulations of cyg a , would be well worthwhile .",
