    "a microscopic understanding of turbulent flows have been amongst the most challenging problems in statistical physics for many years .",
    "central to this challenge is adapting well - developed tools of statistical mechanics to dissipative and out - of - equilibrium turbulent flows .",
    "the early efforts in this direction , due to e. hopf  @xcite and t. d. lee  @xcite , treated the ideal ( inviscid ) equations of hydrodynamics as a finite - dimensional , galerkin - truncated system and obtained equipartition solutions with an energy spectrum , in three dimensions , @xmath4 , at variance with the kolmogorov result @xmath5 for dissipative turbulent flows  @xcite .",
    "a major stumbling block in developing a framework to understand out - of - equilibrium turbulent flows in the language of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics is that a microscopic , hamiltonian formulation of fluid motion with statistically steady states characterised by an invariant gibbs measure inevitably fails .",
    "this is because a self - consistent macroscopic point of view will invariably lead to an irreversible energy loss and thus a dissipative hydrodynamic formulation .",
    "however , since the pioneering work of hopf and cole , and despite the successes in adapting statistical mechanics methods in two - dimensional turbulence  @xcite , the precise relation between statistical physics and turbulence remains an open question .",
    "an important breakthrough in understanding this surprising connection came in the work of majda and timofeyev  @xcite on the one - dimensional galerkin truncated burgers equation which , while exhibiting intrinsic chaos , has nevertheless a compact equilibrium statistical physics description .",
    "the solution to this equation was shown to thermalise , with energy equipartition , in a finite time .",
    "subsequently , cichowlas , _ et al .",
    "_ , in ref .",
    "@xcite discovered through state - of - the - art direct numerical simulations ( dnss ) of the finite - dimensional , truncated , incompressible euler equations that the solutions in a finite time start thermalising .",
    "this process of thermalisation begins at the largest wavenumber of the system  the truncation wavenumber @xmath6 such that all modes with wavenumbers greater than @xmath6 are set to zero  and with time starts extending to smaller and smaller wavenumbers till eventually one obtains an energy spectrum @xmath7 for all wavenumbers @xmath8 .",
    "curiously , it was observed that at intermediate times the energy spectrum showed a transient kolmogorov scaling @xmath5 at smaller non - thermalised wavenumbers and a scaling of @xmath7 for higher wavenumbers all the way upto @xmath6 .",
    "this seminal work thus provided the first numerical evidence of the co - existence of equilibrium micro - states along side a kolmogorov - like turbulent cascade in inviscid , finite - dimensional equations of hydrodynamics ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    a second , recent breakthrough in understanding the interplay between equilibrium statistical mechanics and turbulent flows came through the development of the method of fractal fourier decimation introduced in ref .",
    "this novel method , which allows microsurgeries in the triadic interactions of the non - linear term , was used to show , theoretically and numerically , that there exists special dimensions where fluxless , equilibrium solutions coincide with the kolmogorov spectrum  @xcite ( see also ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently this method was used in several other studies  @xcite to understand triadic interactions _",
    "inter alia _ intermittency , equilibrium solutions and turbulence .    as a result of these very recent developments  @xcite",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , the last few years have seen a furthering in our understanding of the possible existence of equilibrium solutions in inviscid equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "specifically , equipartition solutions to the galerkin - truncated gross - pitaevskii  @xcite , magnetohydrodynamic  @xcite , burgers  @xcite , and euler equations  @xcite have been studied extensively in recent years . alongside the very important theoretical underpinnings of such studies , thermalised or partially thermalised states have been shown  @xcite to be a possible explanation of the ubiquitous bottleneck  @xcite in the energy spectrum of turbulent flows .    despite the rapid advances in this field  @xcite",
    ", an important question remains unanswered .",
    "it has been shown in earlier studies  @xcite , that inviscid , truncated systems thermalise in finite times .",
    "the reason why one obtains thermalised states is of course well known  @xcite : galerkin - truncated ( which we define precisely later ) equations of ideal hydrodynamics ( such as the euler or the inviscid burgers equation ) are conserved dynamical systems with gibbsian statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "a few years ago the first explanation of how such systems thermalise , through a resonant wave - particle interactions mediated by structures called _ tygers _ was given in ref .",
    "however a theoretical or numerical estimate of the time - scale at which thermalisation sets in has proved elusive . in this paper",
    "we address this question and show through theoretical arguments , which are substantiated by detailed numerical simulations , that the time @xmath9 at which thermalisation sets in scales as @xmath10 , where @xmath6 is the galerkin truncation wavenumber ( defined precisely below ) in the problem .",
    "there is one additional , applied reason for investigating the issue of the onset of thermalisation in such systems .",
    "spectral and pseudospectral methods , especially with the advent of fast fourier transform routines , are extremely precise techniques for numerical solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations of hydrodynamics  @xcite . by definition",
    "such methods are limited by finite resolutions and hence are finite - dimensional .",
    "therefore such numerical methods nearly always end up solving the galerkin - truncated variant of the actual equation of hydrodynamics . in viscous calculations , such as the navier - stokes or the viscous burgers equations ,",
    "the difference between the true solution of the equations and its galerkin - truncated variant is often imperceptible .",
    "however in numerical studies of the blow - up problem  @xcite for inviscid equations the onset of thermalised states  which are not admitted in the original infinite dimensional partial differential equation  can have grave consequences on the interpretation of numerical results .",
    "given the formidable theoretical ( and even numerical ) difficulties associated with the incompressible , three - dimensional euler equations , it seems that a convenient starting point to explore the onset of thermalisation in inviscid , finite - dimensional equations of hydrodynamics is the one - dimensional burgers equation .",
    "given its analytical and numerical tractability , the burgers equation has often been used with great success to establish or disprove conjectures for problems pertaining to the euler or navier - stokes equations .",
    "( we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a review of the burgers equations and its many applications . )",
    "we should point out that even in the relatively simpler problem of the inviscid , truncated burgers equation , the limit @xmath11 is not a trivial one .",
    "indeed there are examples of energy - conserving perturbations to the inviscid burgers equation which do not necessarily converge ( in a weak sense ) to the inviscid limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , we begin with the one - dimensional inviscid burgers equation @xmath12 augmented by the initial conditions @xmath13 which are typically a combination of trigonometric functions containing a few fourier modes . without any loss in generality one can choose @xmath14 ; where @xmath15 is some random phase .",
    "since we work in the space of @xmath16 periodic solutions , we can expand the solution of eq . in a fourier series @xmath17 this",
    "allows us to naturally define the galerkin projector @xmath18 as a low - pass filter which sets all modes with fourier wavenumbers @xmath19 , where @xmath6 is a positive ( large ) integer , to zero via @xmath20    these definitions allow us to write the galerkin - truncated inviscid burgers equation as @xmath21 the initial conditions @xmath22 are similarly projected onto the subspace spanned by @xmath6 .",
    "the inviscid burgers equation   conserves all moments of the velocity field ; by contrast the galerkin - truncated version of it   retains only the first three moments of @xmath23 invariants , and in particular the energy .",
    "numerically , however , the dynamics of the galerkin - truncated burgers captures rather well the blowing up ( with smooth initial conditions ) of the gradient of the solution to the inviscid burgers partial differential equation in a finite time @xmath24 .",
    "indeed the cubic - root singularity ( preshock ) , at @xmath25 } \\approx \\frac{1}{\\rm { max } [ \\partial_x v]}$ ] , in @xmath26 is also seen in the solution @xmath23 of the galerkin - truncated equation @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the solution to   for times greater that @xmath24 is obtained by adding a tiny viscous dissipation term @xmath27 , with @xmath28 ( the inviscid limit ) , which yield , depending on the initial conditions , finitely many shocks for times @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "this generalised solution , which converges weakly to the inviscid burgers equation  , is characterised by the dissipative anomaly : energy dissipation @xmath30 remains finite ( with an associated non - conservation of the total energy ) as @xmath28 .",
    "this is very different to the dynamics of the galerkin - truncated equation whose solution @xmath23 stays smooth , conserves energy for all times @xmath29 and thermalise .",
    "we perform extensive and state - of - the art simulations to obtain solutions for @xmath26   and @xmath23   for all times .    the solution the inviscid burgers equation",
    "is obtained by the method of fast legendre transform developed by noullez and vergassola  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "this method takes advantage of the fact  @xcite that the velocity potential @xmath31 defined via @xmath32 is constrained by the maximum principle such that @xmath33 ;   \\label{eq : psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "we typically use the number of collocation points @xmath35 or @xmath36 and choose a time step @xmath37 large enough for a lagrangian particle would move by a distance equal to or larger than the grid spacing @xmath38 and smaller than all other time scales associated with the dynamics .",
    "we , of course , use a different strategy to solve the galerkin - truncated equation  .",
    "we use a pseudo - spectral method  @xcite coupled to a fourth - order runge  kutta time marching with the total collocation points @xmath35 or @xmath36 as before .",
    "we use different values of @xmath6 , ranging from 700 to 20,000 .",
    "our time step @xmath37 varied from @xmath39 for @xmath40 to @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "full dealiasing was ensured in this problem via @xmath6 .    , around @xmath43 for @xmath44 just when the bulge becomes asymmetric @xmath45 and ( inset ) when it is still symmetric @xmath46 .",
    "the tyger , apart from being localised , is monochromatic with a single wavenumber @xmath6 before @xmath9 ( inset )  @xcite ; for @xmath47 , other harmonics smaller than @xmath6 are generated as well . ]",
    "we begin by performing direct numerical simulations of equations   and , without any loss of generality  @xcite , with initial conditions @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a phase which shifts the location of the cubic singularity away from @xmath50 .",
    "for such an initial condition , it is easy to show that @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the solution to the untruncated burgers equation @xmath52 and the truncated burgers equation @xmath53 are shown in fig .",

    "[ time - evolve]d ) .    a useful framework to study the departure from the entropy solution to the thermalised solution is via the discrepancy @xmath59 . for @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",

    "we now know that finite - dimensional equations of hydrodynamics thermalise are mediated through wave - particle resonances .",
    "such resonances at early times manifest themselves as localised structures the instant @xmath67 complex singularities are within one galerkin wavelength @xmath68 of the real domain .",
    "this was shown to be true for both the compressible burgers equation as well as the incompressible euler equations  @xcite .",
