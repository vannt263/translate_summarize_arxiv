    "the riccati equation @xcite @xmath0 appears in several branches of applicable mathematics , for example population dynamics and mathematical physics , as in quantum scattering.it is known that it exhibits chaotic behavior @xcite.it is also well known that , it reduces to a second order linear differential equation by the substitution , @xmath1 , + when we get , @xmath2 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have been studied in detail for a long time@xcite .",
    "+ it may be mentioned that if two solutions of the riccati equation are equal at a point , then they coincide.the reason lies in the continuity of the logarithmic derivative @xmath3 given in the substitution that lead from ( 1 ) to ( 2 ) . + we will now consider exact solutions of the riccati equation in two different contexts , from the field of population dynamics and the field of quantum scattering . epsf",
    "we now examine coupled riccati type equations of relevance to a population model .",
    "consider two - species populations occurring together , and assume that the growth of each is inhibited by members , both of its own and of the other species.denoting the number of individuals in species 1 as @xmath4 and species 2 as @xmath5,we have the gause s competition equations:@xcite @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 are defined below .",
    "thus we are assuming that the per capita growth of each population at an instant is a linear function of the sizes of the two competing populations at that instant.each population would grow logistically if it were alone with logistic parameters @xmath12 and @xmath10 for species 1 and @xmath9 and @xmath11 for species 2 .",
    "+ in general the simultaneous differential equations can not be explicitly solved.we now consider a particular set of circumstances in which they can be solved.thus for ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we specialize to , with a more convenient notation , @xmath13 @xmath14 from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we get , @xmath15 integrating ( 7 ) we have @xmath16 from ( 8) when @xmath17,@xmath18 so that @xmath19 + reverting back to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , this is @xmath22 from ( 9 ) when @xmath23,@xmath24 so that @xmath25 . +",
    "the figure below illustrates a particular case of the above solution with the two populations @xmath20 and @xmath21 along y and x axes .",
    "+      by reversing the method used above , the quantum mechanical radial schrdinger equation @xmath26 can be reduced to a riccati equation @xmath27 by the substitution @xmath28 .",
    "the form ( 10)or ( 11 ) is used in phase shift analysis for example in calogero s variable phase approach @xcite.it is also possible to use the form ( 11 ) for building up an iterative procedure@xcite .we would now like to point out that ( 11 ) can be used in a different context for providing exact solutions for specified classes of the potential function f(r ) .",
    "let us write in ( 11 ) @xmath29 @xmath30 whence we get @xmath31 1.we put g=@xmath32 in ( 12 ) @xmath33 the potential h is now of the form @xmath34 this is the well - known wood - saxon potential .",
    "the solution u is given by @xmath35 2.putting g = r in ( 12 ) , the potential h is given by @xmath36 this is a modified gaussian potential and the solution u is given by @xmath37 the graph is shown in the figure below and is seen to fall very steeply indicative of a confined state or particle .",
    "+   +    3.putting g=1/r in ( 11),the potential h is given by @xmath38 this is a shifted inverse square potential and the solution u is given by @xmath39",
    "we now consider some asymptotic solutions of ( 11),which we write as , @xmath40 let @xmath41 f and g being bounded functions .",
    "so ( 13 ) can be written as , @xmath42 which shows that z is an increasing function of r.suppose z is unbounded.so for large r , we should have from ( 14 ) @xmath43 whence @xmath44 which @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "+ this is a contradiction .",
    "therefore z is bounded and so also u , that is @xmath47as @xmath48 + therefore @xmath49 ( asymptotically ) + therefore for large r,(13 ) becomes @xmath50 @xmath51 by way of verification of ( 15),let us consider ( 13 ) with , @xmath52 so we expect that for large r , @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 by ( 15 ) .",
    "let us put @xmath56 in ( 13 ) .",
    "so @xmath57 or @xmath58 @xmath59 ( everywhere , and so also for large r ) .",
    "using this example , with transformations of the independent variable , we can generate similar solutions .",
    "for example , if we substitute for r , @xmath60 , ( 13 ) becomes @xmath61 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to t.the choice @xmath62 , leads to a similar equation , and one can verify that for @xmath63 is a solution.more generally as can be easily verified @xmath64 is a solution for @xmath65 and so on.however in these examples , neither u nor u are asymptotically bounded .",
    "+ finally it maybe observed that if one solution of the riccati equation ( 13 ) is known , then others could be derived therefrom@xcite .",
