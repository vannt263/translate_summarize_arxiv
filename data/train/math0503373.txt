    "this paper is motivated by the `` fair duel '' problem which the author heard from s.  konyagin @xcite .",
    "the problem is the following : there are two duellists @xmath9 and @xmath10 who will shoot at each other ( only one at a time ) using a given @xmath11 sequence @xmath12 which specifies whose turn it is to shoot at time @xmath13 .",
    "the shots are independent and identically distributed random variables with outcomes hit or miss .",
    "each shot hits ( and therefore kills ) its target with small unknown probability @xmath14 , which is arbitrary but fixed throughout the duel .",
    "the `` fair duel '' problem is to find an ordering @xmath15 , which is independent of @xmath14 , and is as fair as possible in the sense that the probability of survival for each duellist is as close to @xmath16 as possible .",
    "we measure the fairness of an ordering @xmath15 by its _ bias _",
    "function @xmath17 , defined to be @xmath18 and ask that @xmath19 as @xmath20 as fast as possible . to be universal , i.e. , independent of @xmath14 .",
    "otherwise , for any @xmath21 , the bias can be made zero by mapping the fractional @xmath22-expansion of the number @xmath23 in the basis @xmath24 to an ordering @xcite . ]",
    "it is elemantary to calculate the bias in terms of @xmath15 . given that the duel is not over before time @xmath13 , which happens with probability @xmath25 , the probability that @xmath10 is shot at time @xmath13 is equal to @xmath14 if it is the turn of @xmath9 to shoot , and @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "by symmetry of the problem , we find @xmath27 where we have assumed that @xmath28 labels the turn of @xmath9 and @xmath29 labels the turn of @xmath10 .",
    "summing over n , we obtain @xmath30    at first , it may appear as the best ordering should be to simply alternate between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e. , to set @xmath31 , for which @xmath32 .",
    "however , this naive option is quickly ruled out as for instance the @xmath33-periodic sequence given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 yields @xmath38 .",
    "continuing in this fashion , it is tempting to think that the thue - morse sequence on the alphabet @xmath4 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) might perhaps be the optimal sequence . for the thue - morse sequence , one has @xmath39 where the infinite product @xmath40 can in fact be taken as the definition of this sequence .",
    "it is not difficult to show that there is a positive constant @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "( see section [ decay_tm ] for a short derivation . )",
    "it turns out that one can do much better .",
    "one special outcome of this paper will be the construction of universal orderings @xmath15 for which @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an absolute constant .",
    "in fact , we shall prove the following more general result :    [ main_thm ] let @xmath45 be arbitrary and @xmath46 .",
    "there exist constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 such that for any power series @xmath49 , ~~ \\forall n,\\ ] ] there exists a power series with @xmath11 coefficients , i.e. , @xmath50 which satisfies @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] depicts the boundary of the set @xmath53 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 along with the unit circle , which is the limit as @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "an alternative description of this set can be given in the polar coordinates by @xmath59 where we have assumed that @xmath60 is given its positive value .",
    "in this generalized framework , the fair duel problem only corresponds to approximating the zero function @xmath8 by power series with @xmath11 coefficients . for this case",
    ", we can set @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that in general it would be unrealistic to expect close approximations by power series with @xmath11 coefficients at arbitrary points inside the unit disc .",
    "one extreme example is the point @xmath63 . at this point , @xmath64 whereas @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , it is not possible to have a bound of the type @xmath66 near any point @xmath67 as this would imply @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that the point @xmath69 can be replaced by @xmath70 by considering @xmath71 as input and setting @xmath72 .",
    "also , the theorem extends to the case of arbitrary complex coefficients @xmath73 such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 if we allow @xmath76 .",
    "apart from constants , the result of theorem [ main_thm ] is optimal by the following theorem of borwein - erdlyi - ks .",
    "[ borwein_lower_bound ] there are absolute constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 such that for any analytic function @xmath79 defined on the open unit disc @xmath80 that satisfies @xmath81 one has , for any @xmath82 $ ] , @xmath83 }     to see the optimality , it suffices to set @xmath84 .",
    "then for any choice of @xmath73 and @xmath85 in their given range , @xmath79 satisfies the hypothesis of theorem [ borwein_lower_bound ] and moreover @xmath86 .",
    "given any sequence @xmath87 that takes values in the interval @xmath1 $ ] , we will construct a @xmath11 sequence @xmath88 via the following algorithm .",
    "let @xmath89 , be a sequence of real numbers ( to be specified later ) which satisfies @xmath90 we shall call such a sequence @xmath91-admissible . for @xmath92 , let @xmath93 with the convention @xmath94 .",
    "note also that @xmath95 .",
    "an easy induction argument gives that @xmath96 for all @xmath13 : it is true for @xmath97 since @xmath98 .",
    "assume that @xmath99 for all @xmath100 .",
    "then ( [ h_norm ] ) and ( [ w_eq ] ) yield @xmath101 and therefore @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath103 we have the relation @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "hence , using the boundedness of @xmath106 , we obtain the estimate @xmath107 and the problem is reduced to finding a @xmath91-admissible sequence @xmath108 such that the power series @xmath109 decays very rapidly to @xmath26 as @xmath7 .",
    "we shall pick a particular sequence @xmath108 as follows : let @xmath110 be a positive integer .",
    "let @xmath111 and let @xmath112 be defined via @xmath113 below we shall estimate the size of @xmath114 for @xmath105 .",
    "but first we have to show that ( [ h_norm ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we say that @xmath110 is @xmath91-admissible if @xmath115 is @xmath91-admissible . for any @xmath2 , this is obviously the case for all large values of @xmath110 since @xmath116 as @xmath117 .",
    "it is easy to find the @xmath91-admissible values of @xmath110 explicitly .",
    "we have the formula ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath118 which implies that @xmath119 hence @xmath110 is @xmath91-admissible if and only if @xmath120 we note that the smallest attainable value of @xmath110 is @xmath121 and is @xmath91-admissible for @xmath122 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath123 is a decreasing function of @xmath110 ; therefore @xmath124 for all @xmath110 . on that other hand , as @xmath125 , the lower bound for @xmath110 behaves as @xmath126 .",
    "of course the function @xmath114 was not chosen arbitrarily .",
    "first , we claim @xmath127 the first equality follows from the uniform convergence of @xmath114 on the closed unit disc and the second equality follows straight from the formula ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath128 for @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    in order to estimate @xmath114 around @xmath69",
    ", we note that for @xmath105 , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the fourth theta - function of jacobi . hence , ( [ zero_val ] ) and ( [ deriv_theta ] ) now provide us with @xmath133",
    "we take the path of integration to be the straight line segment @xmath134 $ ] connecting @xmath135 to @xmath136 to obtain the estimate @xmath137 near @xmath138 .",
    "one way of doing this is the classical method of applying the poisson summation formula to the modulated gaussian @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "since @xmath142 , we have the identity @xmath143 which then extends to any complex @xmath144 with @xmath145 by analytic continuation , using the principle branch of @xmath146 . clearly the dominating terms for this last expression",
    "are given by @xmath97 and @xmath147 .",
    "we replace @xmath144 by @xmath148 in ( [ theta ] ) and set @xmath149 so that @xmath150 \\big | e^{-\\frac{\\pi^2}{4 \\lambda \\sigma } } \\big | \\nonumber \\\\ & \\lesssim &   \\label{theta - bound } \\frac{1}{|\\lambda \\sigma|^{1/2 } } \\left [ 1+\\frac{\\sigma}{\\re\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right ) } \\right ] e^{-\\frac{\\pi^2}{4 \\sigma}\\re\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we have used the inequality @xmath151 which is valid for all @xmath152 .",
    "( we note that by @xmath153 we mean @xmath154 for an absolute positive constant @xmath155 . ) of course , this upper bound works best if we choose @xmath144 with @xmath156 since @xmath157 .",
    "let us finish the proof of theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "first we note that we do not lose any generality if we exclude the values of @xmath135 in the compact set @xmath158 since for any choice of @xmath73 and @xmath85 in their given range , the function @xmath159 is bounded on @xmath160 by a constant that only depends on @xmath161 and on this set theorem [ main_thm ] does not yield a bound better than a constant anyway .",
    "hence we assume that @xmath162 .",
    "next is a simple lemma that we will employ to finish our analysis .",
    "[ simple_lemma ] let @xmath162 .",
    "there exists an absolute constant @xmath44 such that if @xmath163 where @xmath144 is chosen such that @xmath164 , then @xmath165 .",
    "let us write @xmath166 so that @xmath167 and @xmath168",
    ". the fact that @xmath162 and @xmath169 imply that @xmath170 for some absolute constant @xmath41 . hence we have @xmath171 on the other hand , we also have @xmath172 where the fourth inequality relies on the fact that @xmath53 is a convex set .",
    "this , together with the previous inequality , imply @xmath173 this proves the lemma .",
    "now , using the lemma , we have the bound @xmath174 e^{-\\frac{\\pi^2}{4 \\sigma}\\re\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right ) } \\lesssim \\sigma m e^{-\\frac{2c}{\\sigma m |1-s|}}.\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is an absolute positive constant . on the other hand",
    ", we have @xmath175 so that @xmath176 hence we obtain the desired estimate @xmath177 which concludes the proof of theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "for the special case @xmath8 that corresponds to the fair duel problem , we can set @xmath61 , @xmath62 and choose any @xmath179 .",
    "let us call the resulting sequence @xmath180 .",
    "moreover , we are only interested in approximation of @xmath0 for real values of @xmath135 .",
    "it is easy to check from the proof of theorem [ main_thm ] that we now have @xmath181    below is the first @xmath182 values of @xmath183 computed using our algorithm . for the compactness of presentation , we list it as a @xmath184 sequence rather than a @xmath11 sequence .",
    "@xmath185 note that it would be necessary to employ special numerical methods to compute the terms for arbitrarily large @xmath13 due to the possibility of the accumulation of rounding errors .",
    "it is interesting that the beginning of the sequence @xmath186 bears a remarkable resemblance with the thue - morse sequence :    @xmath187      for the completeness of our discussion we present below a short derivation of the decay of bias for the thue - morse sequence .",
    "let @xmath188 be the unique integer such that @xmath189 .",
    "we have @xmath190 hence it suffices to estimate the product of the first @xmath191 terms . for this",
    "it suffices to use the simple inequality @xmath192 .",
    "we now have @xmath193      the proof of theorem [ main_thm ] employed the boundedness of the sequence @xmath194 .",
    "it is possible to relax this condition by allowing for mild ( e.g. sub - exponential ) growth of @xmath195 .",
    "this generalization is one possible direction to seek better approximations .",
    "our algorithm was inspired by sigma - delta quantization ; in fact , the particular scheme that we have employed corresponds to an `` infinite - order '' limit of a family of schemes developed in @xcite .",
