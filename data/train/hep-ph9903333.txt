    "models where gauge interactions  @xcite rather than gravity serve as messengers of supersymmetry breaking have been the focus of many recent phenomenological analyses  @xcite of supersymmetry ( susy ) . in these models ,",
    "sparticle masses and decay patterns differ from those in the extensively studied msugra model  @xcite which has served as the framework for many experimental analyses of supersymmetry .",
    "perhaps the most important difference between the msugra framework and gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models with a low susy breaking scale is the identity of the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) . in the former case ,",
    "the lightest neutralino ( @xmath2 ) is almost always the lsp , while in the gmsb framework , the gravitino is much lighter than other sparticles .",
    "moreover , while the gravitino is essentially decoupled in msugra scenarios , the couplings of the goldstino ( which forms the longitudinal components of the massive gravitino ) , though much smaller than gauge couplings , may nonetheless be relevant for collider physics in that they can cause the next to lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) to decay into a gravitino _ inside the detector_. the precise decay pattern and lifetime of the nlsp depends on its identity and on model parameters .",
    "for instance , if @xmath2 is the nlsp , it would decay via @xmath3 , and if kinematically allowed , also via @xmath4 , or into the various higgs bosons of susy models via @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the nlsp is a slepton , it would decay via @xmath7 , _ etc .",
    "_ sparticles other than the nlsp decay only very rarely to gravitinos , so that it is safe to neglect these decays in any analysis",
    ". thus heavier sparticles cascade decay as usual to the nlsp , which then decays into the gravitino as described above .",
    "sparticle signatures differ from those in the msugra framework for two basic reasons .",
    "first , if the nlsp is not the lightest neutralino , the cascade decay patterns to the nlsp are modified .",
    "second , the nlsp ( which need not be electrically neutral ) itself decays into a gravitino and standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "the gravitinos escape the experimental apparatus undetected resulting in @xmath8 in susy events . in the gmsb framework , however , neutralino nlsp decays may also result in isolated photons or @xmath9 or higgs bosons which could provide additional handles to reduce sm backgrounds to the susy signal .",
    "if the nlsp is a slepton , all susy events should contain leptons of the same flavour as the slepton nlsp in addition to @xmath8 . while it may be possible to have other candidates for the nlsp",
    ", this does not seem to be the case in the simplest realizations of the gmsb framework , and we will not consider this possibility any further .    within the minimal gmsb framework , supersymmetry breaking in a hidden sector is communicated to the observable sector via sm gauge interactions of messenger particles ( with quantum numbers of @xmath10 doublet quarks and leptons ) whose mass scale is characterized by @xmath11 . as a result , the soft susy breaking masses induced for the various sparticles are directly proportional to the strength of their gauge interactions .",
    "thus , coloured squarks are heavier than sleptons , and gluinos are heavier than electroweak gauginos .",
    "the observable sector sparticle masses and couplings are determined ( at the scale @xmath11 ) by the gmsb model parameter set , @xmath12 of these , @xmath13 is the most important parameter in that it sets the scale of sparticle masses .",
    "the model predictions for the mass parameters at the scale @xmath11 are then evolved down to the sparticle mass scale via renormalization group evolution ( rge ) .",
    "radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry determines @xmath14 .",
    "the weak scale susy parameters depend only weakly on the messenger mass scale @xmath11 , since this primarily enters as the scale at which the mass relations predicted by the model are assumed to be valid .",
    "there is an additional dependence of the sparticle spectrum on @xmath11 due to threshold effects@xcite , but this is also weak as long as @xmath15 is not very close to unity .",
    "messenger quarks and lepton , it is assumed , can be classified into complete vector representations of @xmath16 : the number ( @xmath17 ) of such multiplets is required to be @xmath18 for the messenger scale @xmath19 in order that the gauge couplings remain perturbative up to the grand unification scale .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath20  @xcite ( essentially , the ratio of hidden sector to messenger sector susy breaking vevs ) can be used to dial the gravitino mass beyond its minimum value .",
    "effectively , @xmath21 parametrizes the rate for sparticle decays into a gravitino .",
    "this decay is most rapid when @xmath22 , while for larger values of @xmath21 the nlsp may decay with an observable decay vertex , or may even be sufficiently long - lived to pass all the way through the detector . in this extreme case",
    ", susy event topologies would be identical to those in the msugra model if @xmath2 is the nlsp .",
    "however , for the case where a charged slepton is the nlsp , susy events would necessarily contain a pair of penetrating tracks from the long - lived slepton nlsp , which might be detectable at the tevatron as `` additional ( possibly slow ) muons '' @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we assume that the nlsp decays promptly and fix @xmath22 ; _ i.e. _ we do not attempt to model the additional handle displaced vertices might provide to reduce sm backgrounds .",
    "many of the phenomenological implications depend only weakly on the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the @xmath23 plane provides a convenient panorama for illustrating the diversity of phenomenological possibilities in gmsb scenarios .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 for @xmath24 and _ a _ )",
    "@xmath25 , _ b _ )  @xmath26 , _ c _ )  @xmath27 and _ d _ )  @xmath28 .",
    "we choose @xmath29 to be positive since for this choice the model predictions  @xcite are well within experimental constraints  @xcite from the decay @xmath30 over essentially the whole plane . in region  1 in fig .",
    "1_a_-_d _ ( the boundaries of these regions are the heavy solid lines ) , the lightest neutralino is the nlsp , so that @xmath31 ( and to @xmath9 and higgs bosons if these decays are kinematically allowed ) . in region 2 ,",
    "@xmath32 , while other sleptons are heavier than @xmath2 , and cascade decays of sparticles terminate in @xmath33 , except immediately above the boundary between regions 1 and 2 where the decay @xmath34 is kinematically forbidden . for parameters in region 2",
    ", we thus expect an excess of @xmath1 leptons in susy events  @xcite . in regions 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "1_b - d _ , not only @xmath33 , but also @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are lighter than @xmath2 .",
    "thus neutralinos are effectively sources of real ( dominantly right - handed ) sleptons . in region 3 , @xmath37 because its decay @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is kinematically forbidden .",
    "the decay @xmath40 which occurs via suppressed muon yukawa couplings is kinematically allowed , and may compete with the decay to @xmath41 ; for @xmath42 , we find that this decay ( which has been included in our computation ) , is unimportant . in region  4 , the decays @xmath43 and @xmath44 are also allowed , and compete with the gravitino decay of @xmath45 .",
    "frequently , the stau decays of @xmath45 dominate its decays to gravitino , and then , as for region 2 , susy events will be characterized by an abundance of taus in the final state .",
    "signals from sparticle production will clearly depend on which of these regions the model parameters happen to lie .    the grey regions in fig .",

    "mssm searches for acollinear electron pairs exclude selectrons lighter than about 90  gev .",
    "this limit should certainly be valid within this framework if @xmath53 ( region 3 ) or even if it decays to @xmath2 that subsequently decays to a photon ( region 1 ) .",

    "the delphi collaboration  @xcite has obtained a preliminary bound @xmath62  gev for @xmath58 , for parameters in region 1 . if @xmath63 , @xmath2s act as sources of staus and add to the signal from direct stau pair production .",

    ", in the horizontally hatched region @xmath67  gev , whereas in the region with vertical hatches , @xmath65  gev .",
    "finally , the lep experiments @xcite have a preliminary bound of 91 - 95  gev on the mass of the sm higgs boson .",
    "since , for small values of @xmath68 the lighter higgs boson @xmath69 of the gmsb framework is frequently close to the sm higgs boson , we also show the regions with @xmath70  gev ( the diagonally hatched area in the lower left corner ) in fig .  1 .",
    "furthermore , lep analyses exclude @xmath71  gev when @xmath68 is large .",
    "this excludes the thin ( diagonally hatched ) sliver where @xmath72 .",
    "the reader should appreciate that the various shaded regions that we have shown are not formal experimental limits , but indicate the reach of present experiments within the gmsb framework .",
    "we see from fig .  1 that current experiments have already probed regions 1 and 2 if @xmath73 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath74 , we have just these two regions , while @xmath58 , all four regions are still possible .",
    "since experimental signatures within the gmsb framework differ significantly from those in the mssm and msugra models , it is of interest to reassess the sensitivity of tevatron experiments to signals from sparticle production at the upcoming run  ii of the tevatron main injector ( mi ) as well as at the proposed luminosity upgrade ( dubbed tev33 ) where an integrated luminosity @xmath75  @xmath76 might be accumulated .",
    "this is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "we had begun this program in an earlier study @xcite where we had computed cross sections for various susy event topologies for models with @xmath57 expected at the tevatron : in this case , the nlsp is dominantly the hypercharge gaugino . here , we first repeat this analysis for somewhat different model parameters , using cuts and acceptances more appropriate to run ii .",
    "we have also fixed a bug in the program  @xcite which resulted in an underestimate of the chargino pair production cross section .",
    "we also examine cases with larger values of @xmath17 for which we expect the phenomenology to change qualitatively from our earlier study . toward this end",
    ", we first examine a model line with @xmath58 with @xmath77 where @xmath33 is the nlsp and significantly lighter than other sleptons .",
    "next , we examine a model line with @xmath78 where all right handed sleptons are roughly degenerate in mass ( the co - nlsp scenario ) , and where @xmath55 ( @xmath79 ) dominantly decay via @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . finally , we examine a non - minimal model where the nlsp is dominantly a higgsino - like neutralino .",
    "this is not because we believe this is any more likely than the mgmsb scenarios previously discussed , but because it leads to qualitatively different experimental signatures . in view of the fact",
    "that the underlying mechanism of susy breaking , and hence the resulting mass pattern , is unknown it seems worthwhile to explore implications of unorthodox scenarios , particularly when they lead to qualitative differences in the phenomenology .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the upgrades that we have made to isajet to facilitate the simulation of the minimal gmsb framework that we have described , as well as several of its non - mimimal extensions . in sec .",
    "iii we specify four different model lines and discuss strategies for separating the susy signal from sm background for each of these . our main result is the projection for the reach of experiments at the mi and at tev33 .",
    "we end in sec .",
    "iv with a summary of our results together with some general remarks .",
    "we use the event generator program isajet v 7.40 for simulating susy events at the tevatron . since isajet has been described elsewhere @xcite",
    ", we will only discuss recent improvements that we have made that facilitate the simulation of the mgmsb model specified by the parameter set ( [ eq : mgmsb ] ) , and also , some of its variants . the ` gmsb option ' allows one to use the parameter set ( [ eq : mgmsb ] ) as an input .",
    "isajet then computes sparticle masses at the messenger scale @xmath11 , then evolves these down to the lower scale relevant for phenomenology , and finally calculates the ` mssm parameters ' that are then used in the evaluation of sparticle cross sections and decay widths .",
    "the decays of neutralinos into gravitinos , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 as well as ( approximately ) the dalitz decay @xmath85 are included in isajet .",
    "the decays @xmath86 and @xmath87 , as well as the three body decays  @xcite @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are mediated by a virtual neutralino , have also been included .",
    "the widths for corresponding three body decays mediated by virtual chargino exchange are suppressed by the lepton yukawa coupling , and are also included .",
    "these decays can be significant only for smuons , and only when @xmath90 so that the neutralino - mediated three body decays of @xmath79 are kinematically very suppressed or forbidden .",
    "although for @xmath22 we have not found this to be important , for larger values of @xmath21 , the ( long - lived ) smuon may dominantly decay via the chargino mediated decay to a stau , and may alter the apparent curvature of the ` smuon track ' in the detector  @xcite .",
    "we have also included in isajet the facility to simulate several non - minimal gauge - mediated susy breaking models that involve additional parameters . while these will be irrelevant to the analysis performed in our present study , we have chosen to describe this for completeness because it may prove useful to readers studying extensions of the minimal class of models .",
    "* the parameter @xmath91 allows the user to adjust  @xcite the ratio between the gaugino and scalar masses by scaling the former by the factor @xmath91 which is equal to unity in the minimal gmsb framework . * in gmsb models ,",
    "additional interactions are needed to generate the dimensional @xmath29 and @xmath92 parameters that are essential from phenomenological considerations .",
    "these interactions can split the soft susy breaking masses of higgs and lepton doublets ( at the messenger scale ) even though these have the same gauge quantum numbers .",
    "these additional contributions to the squared masses of higgs doublets that couple to up and down type fermions , are parametrized  @xcite by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "these parameters are zero in the minimal model . *",
    "if the hypercharge @xmath95-term has a non - zero expectation value @xmath96 in the messenger sector , it will lead to additional contributions to sfermion masses at the messenger scale which may be parametrized  @xcite as @xmath97 .",
    "the value of @xmath96 ( which is zero in the minimal gmsb framework ) is constrained as it can lead to an unacceptable pattern of electroweak symmetry . *",
    "finally , allowing incomplete messenger representations  @xcite can effectively result in different numbers ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) for each factor of the gauge group .",

    "we see from fig .",
    "1_a _ that for @xmath57 , the lightest neutralino is the nlsp as long as @xmath68 is not very large .",
    "since the value of @xmath14 computed from radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry is rather large , the nlsp is mainly a bino . to realize the bino nlsp model line , we fix @xmath126 which ensures that sleptons are significantly heavier than @xmath66 .",

    "the neutralino @xmath137 dominantly decays via @xmath138 ( for @xmath139  tev ) when this decay is not kinematically suppressed : otherwise it decays via @xmath140 , with roughly equal branching fractions for all three lepton flavours .",
    "we thus expect that @xmath141 and @xmath142 production will mainly lead to jetty events ( counting hadronically decaying taus as jets ) possibly with additional @xmath143 and @xmath29 plus photons plus @xmath8 .",
    "we use isajet to classify the supersymmetric signal events primarily by the number of isolated photons  events with @xmath144 photons arise when one or more of the photons is outside the geometric acceptance , has too low an @xmath110 , or happens to be close to hadrons and thus fails the isolation requirement .",

    "we expect that the backgrounds are smallest in the two photon channel , which we will mainly focus on for the purpose of assessing the reach .",
    "we have not attempted to assess the background because the recent analysis by the d0 collaboration @xcite , searching for charginos and neutralinos in the gmsb framework , points out that the major portion of the background arises from mismeasurement of qcd jets and for yet higher values of @xmath8 from misidentification of jets / leptons as photons . in other words , this background is largely instrumental , and hence rather detector - dependent . from fig .  1 of ref",

    "it should be remembered that the efficiency for identifying taus is expected to be smaller than for identifying photons ",
    "first , the tau has to decay hadronically , and then the hadronic decay products have to form a jet .    in our analysis , in addition to the basic acceptance cuts discussed in section ii , we require @xmath197  gev together with at least one of the following which serve as a trigger for the events :    * one lepton with @xmath198  gev , * two leptons each with @xmath199  gev , * @xmath200  gev .",

    "instrumental backgrounds that we have attempted to estimate are @xmath8 from mismeasurement of jet energy and mis - identification of qcd jets as taus .",
    "we have checked that even after these cuts and triggers , sm backgrounds from @xmath210 production swamp the signal in channels with no leptons or just one identified lepton ( @xmath143 , @xmath29 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "the former is the canonical @xmath8 signal , which after optimizing cuts , may be observable at run 2 if gluinos are lighter than @xmath212  gev .",
    "we do not expect that this signal from gluino and squark production will be detectable since even for @xmath213  tev , @xmath214  gev with squarks somewhat heavier .",
    "for this reason , and because there are large single lepton backgrounds from @xmath210 production , we focus on signals with two or more leptons in our study . also , because the presence of @xmath1 s is the hallmark of this scenario , we mostly concentrate on leptonic events with at least one identified @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by considering the signal and background cross sections for clean events .",
    "these are shown in table [ clean ] .",
    "events are classified first by the number of identified taus , and then by the lepton multiplicity ; the @xmath215 in the topology column denotes `` clean '' events . for each topology ,",
    "the first row of numbers denotes the cross sections after the basic acceptance cuts and trigger requirements along with the @xmath9 veto and the @xmath216 cut discussed above .",
    "we see that there is still a substantial background in several of the multilepton channels .",
    "this background can be strongly suppressed , with modest loss of signal by imposing an additional requirement ,    * @xmath217  gev ,    on the visible energy of the hardest tau in events with at least one identified tau . in the background , the @xmath1s typically come from vector boson decays , while in the signal a substantial fraction of these come from the direct decays of charginos and neutralinos that are substantially heavier than @xmath218 ( remember even @xmath219  ( 132 )  gev for @xmath220  ( 50 )  tev ) : thus signal taus pass this cut more easily .",
    "a few points about this table are worth mentioning .    1 .",
    "the signal cross sections in each channel are at most a few @xmath162 , and with an integrated luminosity of 2  @xmath76 , the individual signals are below the @xmath163 level even for @xmath221  tev . for the integrated luminosity expected in run ii of the mi",
    "we will be forced to add the signal in various channels and see if this inclusive signal is observable .",
    "the sum of the signal in all the channels in table [ clean ] , except the @xmath222 channel which has a very large background , is shown in the next two rows both with and without the @xmath204 cut on the @xmath1 , while in the last two rows we list @xmath223 .",
    "we see that a somewhat better significance is obtained after the @xmath217  gev cut .",
    "we see that the inclusive susy signal in the clean channels for the @xmath220  tev case should be detectable with the run ii integrated luminosity , whereas for the @xmath224  tev case an integrated luminosity of 12  @xmath76 is needed for a 5@xmath225 signal .",
    "we caution the reader that about 25 - 30% of the @xmath1 background comes from mis - tagging qcd jets as taus ( except , of course , for the @xmath210 backgrounds and the backgrounds in the @xmath226 channels which are almost exclusively from these fake taus ) .",
    "thus our estimate of the background level is somewhat sensitive to the @xmath1 faking algorithm we have used .",
    "the signal , on the other hand , almost always contains only real @xmath1s , so that improving the discrimination between @xmath1 and qcd jets will lead to an increase in the projected reach of these experiments .",
    "5 .   in some channels",
    "the background is completely dominated by fake taus .",
    "for instance , after the @xmath227 cut , the @xmath228 background from @xmath210 sources of just _ real taus _ is only 1.9  @xmath162 , while the signal and other backgrounds remain essentially unaltered from the cross sections in table [ clean ] .",
    "thus if fake @xmath1 backgrounds can be greatly reduced , it may be possible to see a signal via other channels .",
    "next , we turn to jetty signals for model line b. cross sections for selected signal topologies together with sm backgrounds _ after _ the @xmath229  gev cut are shown in table [ jetty ] .",
    "the other topologies appear to suffer from large sm backgrounds and we have not included them here .",
    "the following features are worth nothing .    1 .",
    "we see that model line b results in smaller cross sections in jetty channels .",
    "this should not be surprising since electroweak production of charginos , neutralinos and sleptons are the dominant susy processes , and because staus are light , branching fractions for hadronic decays of @xmath230 and @xmath231 tend to be suppressed .",
    "we see from table [ jetty ] that with the present set of cuts , not only is the signal below the level of observability in any one of the channels , but also that the inclusive signal is not expected to be observable at the mi even for the @xmath232  tev case . with an integrated luminosity of 25  @xmath76",
    "the signal for the @xmath233  tev case is observable at the @xmath234 level .",
    "3 .   as for the clean lepton case ,",
    "a significant portion of the background comes from qcd jets faking a tau .",
    "the fraction of events with a fake tau varies from channel to channel , but for the @xmath235 channel in table [ jetty ] almost 60% of the background ( in contrast to essentially none of the signal ) involves at least one fake @xmath1 .",
    "4 .   a major background to",
    "the jetty signal comes from @xmath175 production . to see if we could enhance the signal relative to this background we tried to impose additional cuts to selectively reduce the top background . since",
    "top events are expected to contain hard jets , we first tried to require @xmath236  gev .",
    "we also , independently , tried vetoing events where the invariant mass of all jets exceeded 70  gev . while both attempts lead to an improvement of the signal to background ratio , the statistical significance of the signal is not improved ( and is even degraded ) by these additional cuts .",
    "we do not present details about this for the sake of brevity .",
    "it may be possible to reduce the top background by vetoing events with tagged @xmath0-jets , but we have not attempted to do so here .    for model line b , it appears that experiments at the mi should be able to probe @xmath13 values up to just beyond 40  tev in the inclusive clean multilepton channels .",
    "it appears , however , that it will be essential to sum up several channels to obtain a signal at the @xmath163 level .",
    "confirmatory signals in inclusive jetty channels may be observable at the @xmath237 level .",
    "of course , for an integrated luminosity of 25  @xmath76 it may be possible to probe @xmath233  tev even in the unfavoured jetty channels , and somewhat beyond in the clean channels .",
    "the situation is summarized in fig .",
    "[ mlb : reach ] where we show the signal cross sections summed over the selected channels for events without jets ( dashed ) and for events with jets ( solid ) .",
    "the horizontal lines denote the minimum cross section needed for the signal to be observable at the @xmath163 level , for the two assumptions about the integrated luminosity .",
    "we note that , in some channels , a susbtantial fraction of background events come from qcd jets faking a tau  our assessment of the run ii reach is thus sensitive to our modelling of this jet mis - tag rate . by the same token ,",
    "if this rate can be reduced , the reach may be somewhat increased .",
    "finally , we remark that even though it appears that the range of parameters that is accessible to experiments at the mi is very limited ( @xmath238  tev ) , these parameters correspond to charginos as heavy as 192  gev and gluinos and squarks around 700  gev .",
    "this scenario can simply be obtained by choosing parameters in regions 3 of fig .  1 , so that @xmath55 , @xmath79 and @xmath33 are all approximately degenerate , and @xmath55 and @xmath79 can not decay to @xmath33 .",

    "the lightest neutralino decays via @xmath249 with branching fractions essentially independent of the lepton flavour .",
    "the bottom line of these decay patterns is that even though @xmath33 is strictly speaking the nlsp , we expect a large multiplicity of isolated leptons ( @xmath143 and @xmath29 ) from sparticle production at colliders .",
    "this is because all flavours of sleptons are roughly equally produced in susy cascade decays , and decays of @xmath55 and @xmath79 do not involve a stau at an intermediate stage .",

    "we also impose this requirement , which should facilitate triggering on these events even without a @xmath1 trigger , on the signal  @xcite .",
    "in our simulation we found that the background from @xmath210 and @xmath9 plus jet production , as well as @xmath175 production are negligible .",
    "we see that the @xmath256-lepton background is an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding @xmath257 backgrounds in tables [ clean ] and [ jetty ] ( even though the cuts there are more stringent than in table [ 4lep ] ) .",

    "the corresponding horizontal lines denote the levels where the signal will be just detectable at the ` @xmath163 level ' ( with a minumum of at least five events ) at the mi and at the proposed tev33 upgrade .",
    "we observe the following .    * with an integrated luminosity of 2  @xmath76 , the signal is rate - limited in the @xmath261 channel , and experiments at the mi should be able to probe @xmath13 out to about 45  tev ( corresponding to charginos heavier than 300 gev ) if we require a minimum signal level of five events .",
    "including taus increases the signal but also increases the background so that the reach is only marginally improved .",

    "we focussed on the @xmath307 signal which has the best @xmath308 ratio , and required in addition that @xmath294  gev ( which reduces the background by almost 50% with about a 20% loss of signal ) and further 60  gev @xmath309 140  gev ( which reduces the background by another factor of half with a loss of 25% of the signal )  @xcite .",
    "we found , however , that the signal is below the 5@xmath225 level over essentially the entire range of @xmath13 even at tev33 : only for @xmath310  tev does the signal cross section exceed this @xmath163 level of 7.7  fb .",
    "moreover the @xmath308 ratio never exceeds about 15% which falls below our detectability criterion @xmath311% .",
    "we found that while it is possible to improve the @xmath308 ratio via additional cuts , these typically degrade the statistical significance of the signal .",
    "we thus conclude that for model line d , there will be no observable signal in the @xmath312 channel even at tev33 .    before closing this discussion",
    ", it seems worth noting that we should interpret the reach in fig .",
    "[ mld : reach ] with some care , because unlike in the study of model lines a , b and c , we do not really have a well - motivated underlying theory ( that gives a higgsino nlsp ) .",
    "we realized this by arbitrarily taking @xmath313 .",
    "the nlsp decay pattern , and hence the precise value of the reach , would depend on this choice which should be regarded as illustrative .",
    "in general , however , for the higgsino nlsp model line , the coupling of the nlsp to higgs bosons is substantial so that the branching fraction for the decay @xmath300 becomes large when this decay is not kinematically suppressed . for small values of @xmath13 , such that the nlsp can only decay via @xmath49 , susy signals should be readily observable in the @xmath314 channel ; once the nlsp decay to @xmath69 begins to dominate , the cross section for diphoton events becomes unobservably small , and the susy signal mainly manifests itself as multiple @xmath0 events which have large backgrounds from @xmath175 production .",
    "the most promising way to search for susy then seems to be via @xmath8 events with @xmath315 tagged @xmath0-jets but for a search in this channel an integrated luminosity of 25  @xmath76 appears essential .",
    "a signal that extends the reach beyond that in the @xmath293 channel is possible provided experiments are able to reduce the background from mis - tagged charm ( light quark or gluon ) jets to below 5% ( 0.2% ) .",
    "the gmsb framework provides a phenomenologically viable alternative to the msugra model .",
    "the novel feature of this framework is that susy breaking may be a low energy phenomenon . in this case , the gravitino is by far the lightest sparticle , and the nlsp decays within the detector into a gravitino and sm sparticles .",
    "sparticle signals , and hence the reach of experimental facilities , are then sensitive to the identity of the nlsp .    in this paper",
    ", we have examined signals for supersymmetric particle production at the tevatron , and evaluated the susy reach of experiments at the mi or at the proposed tev33 within the gmsb framework . in our study",
    ", we consider four different model lines , each of which lead to qualitatively different experimental signatures .",
    "we use the event generator to simulate experimental conditions at the tevatron , and for each model line , we have identified additional cuts that serve to enhance the susy signal over sm backgrounds .",
    "we assume the nlsp decay is prompt .",
    "this is a conservative assumption in that we do not make use of a displaced vertex to enhance the signal over sm background .",
    "for the first of these model lines , labelled a , the nlsp is mainly a hypercharge gaugino and dominantly decays via @xmath316 , so that susy will lead to extremely striking events with multiple jets with hard leptons and large @xmath8 and up to two hard , isolated photons , with cross sections ( after all cuts ) shown in fig .",
    "[ mla : csection ] .",
    "the physics background to the @xmath293 event topologies is very small , and detector - dependent instrumental backgrounds ( such as from jets being mis - identified as photons or leptons , or large mismeasurement of transverse energies ) dominate  @xcite .",
    "even with a conservative estimate of 1  @xmath162 for the background cross section , experiments at the mi ( tev33 ) should be able to probe values of the model parameter @xmath13 out to 110  tev ( 130  tev ) .",
    "if we optimistically assume that this background can be reduced to a negligible level by hardening the cuts on the photons and @xmath8 , we find a reach as high as @xmath317  tev ( corresponding to a gluino of 950  gev ) at the mi and of 145  tev at tev33 . for this model line , the @xmath169 signal from slepton pair production may be observable at tev33 even if sleptons are as heavy as 180  gev .    in model line",
    "b , the lighter stau is the nlsp , and heavier sparticles cascade decayed down to the stau , which then decays via @xmath318 .",
    "the presence of isolated tau leptons  @xcite , in addition to jets and other leptons is the hallmark of such a scenario .",
    "we found , however , that in some channels , the background from misidentification of qcd jets as @xmath1 completely swamp the physics backgrounds , making it very difficult to detect the signal ( see _ e.g. _ the @xmath319 channel in table [ clean ] ) in this channel . we conclude that unless @xmath1 misidentification can be greatly reduced from what we have assumed , susy will only be detectable via channels with at least three leptons ( @xmath320 and @xmath1 ) for which the cross sections are individually small , and then , only by summing the signal in several channels .",
    "even here , backgrounds from mis - identified taus are significant . our assessment of the reach",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ mlb : reach ] . we see that at the mi the clean multilepton channel offers the best reach , out to @xmath321  gev ( corresponding to @xmath322  gev and squarks and gluinos as heavy as 700  gev ) , while at tev33 , the reach may be extended out to @xmath13 values somewhat beyond 50  tev ( @xmath323  gev ) .    in model line c ,",
    "the lighter stau is again the nlsp but the lighter selectron and smuon are essentially degenerate with it , so that @xmath55 and @xmath79 can not decay into a tau ; _ i.e. _ these decay into a gravitino and a corresponding lepton .",
    "since cascade decays of sparticles are equally likely to terminate in each flavour of slepton , we expect that this model line will lead to very large multiplicities of @xmath143 , @xmath29 and @xmath1 in susy events .",
    "indeed we found that the optimal strategy in this case was to search for events with @xmath324 or @xmath325 with @xmath326 .",
    "the reach is shown in fig .",
    "[ mlc : reach ] .",
    "we see that at the mi , there should be observable signals out to @xmath327  tev while at tev33 @xmath13 values as high as 55  tev should be observable .",
    "these correspond to a gluino ( chargino ) mass of 1000 ( 320 )  gev and 1200 ( 400 )  gev , respectively !",
    "finally , we have examined an unorthodox model line where , by hand , we adjust the value of @xmath29 to be smaller than the value of the hypercharge gaugino mass @xmath265 .",
    "this leads to an nlsp which is dominantly a higgsino .",
    "furthermore , @xmath328 so that the fermions from @xmath230 and @xmath137 decays to @xmath2 are soft , and susy event topologies are largely determined by the decay pattern of @xmath2 . for small values of @xmath13 for which the nlsp can only decay via @xmath49 ,",
    "the signal is readily observable in the @xmath314 channel .",
    "however , once the nlsp decay to @xmath69 begins to dominate , susy mainly manifests itself as multiple @xmath0 events which have large backgrounds from @xmath175 production .",
    "the most promising way to search for susy then seems to be via @xmath8 events with @xmath315 tagged @xmath0-jets and zero leptons . for a search in this channel , an integrated luminosity of @xmath14825  @xmath76 appears essential .",
    "a signal that extends the reach beyond that in the @xmath293 channel is possible provided experiments are able to reduce the background from mis - tagged charm ( light quark or gluon ) jets to below 5% ( 0.2% ) .",
    "the reach for model line d is shown in fig .",
    "[ mld : reach ] , but it should be kept in mind that the details of this figure will be sensitive to our assumption about @xmath29 .    to conclude , in gmsb models signals for susy events will be quantitatively and qualitatively different from those in the msugra framework .",
    "this is primarily because a neutralino nlsp decays into a photon , a @xmath9 boson or a higgs boson and a gravitino , or sparticles cascade decay to a slepton nlsp which decays to leptons and a gravitino : these additional bosons ( or their visible decay products ) , or leptons from slepton nlsp decays , often provide an additional handle which may be used to enhance the signal over sm background .",
    "although we have not performed an exhaustive parameter scan , for the model lines that we studied we found that the susy reach ( as measured in terms of the mass of the dominantly produced sparticles ) is at least as big , and frequently larger than in the msugra framework . for some cases , this conclusion depend on the capability of experiments to identify @xmath1 leptons and @xmath0-quarks with moderately high efficiency and purity . in view of the diversity of signals that appear possible for just this one class of models ,",
    "we encourage our experimental colleagues to be in readiness for tagging third generation particles as they embark on the search for new phenomena in run ii of the tevatron .",
    "we are grateful to our colleagues in the gauge - mediated susy breaking group of the run ii susy and higgs workshop , especially steve martin , scott thomas , ray culbertson and jianming qian for sharing their insights .",
