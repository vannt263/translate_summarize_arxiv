    "anderson localization @xcite was discovered 50 years ago in disordered crystals as an accumulation of single particle electronic wavefunctions and can be interpreted as an interference effect between multiple scatterings of the electron by random defects of the potential . as a consequence eigenstates are no longer spatially extended , but exponentially localized .",
    "anderson localization is a universal phenomenon of wave physics , unrestricted to quantum mechanics .",
    "experimental observations were made in noninteracting bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) expanding in random optical potentials @xcite , light propagation in spatially random nonlinear optical media @xcite , and in microwave cavities filled with randomly distributed scatterers @xcite .",
    "anderson localization is a linear wave effect , i.e.  it is well - established for wave equations which are linear in the wave amplitude .",
    "however , in many cases one is confronted with a nonlinear response of the wave - carrying medium ; for instance , large light intensities induce a nonlinear response of the optical medium .",
    "electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions also result in substantial deviations from anderson localization in solids . in experiments of bose - einstein condensates",
    "the interatomic interactions are always present , although they can be diminished by either decreasing atomic densities or by exploiting magnetically tunable feshbach resonances",
    ".    from a mathematical perspective , a linear wave equation is integrable , with each normal mode evolving independently in time .",
    "a localized wave packet in the presence of anderson localization will therefore stay localized as time evolves .",
    "nonlinearity will usually destroy the integrability of a system and induce mode - mode interactions .",
    "it was observed numerically that wave packets in such nonlinear disordered wave equations delocalize in time without respecting anderson localization limits @xcite .",
    "thus , there are several intriguing questions which have attracted much attention during the last few years : ( i ) will anderson localization be destroyed by arbitrary small strength of nonlinearity or is there a threshold below which the localization is restored ?",
    "( ii ) will wave packet spreading , if observed , last forever or will it stop at certain ( though probably very large ) time ? ( iii ) is the shape of the initial wave packet crucial for the details of spreading",
    "? we will mainly address question ( ii ) here .",
    "johansson et al .",
    "@xcite conjectured that spreading must eventually stop and dynamics will become close to regular , assuming that in these limits the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem is applicable , i.e.  that for small wave density regular nonergodic phase space structures predominate and the dynamics develops along kam tori .",
    "other attempts consist in a numerical scaling analysis , in order to predict and extend results beyond computational ability @xcite .",
    "analytical studies perform perturbation theory to higher order by treating the strength of nonlinearity as a small parameter @xcite , conflicting with the explosive growth of secular terms in higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "this theory states that for the disordered discrete nonlinear schrdinger model with nonlinearity strength exceeding a finite threshold , any initial localized wave packet can not fully spread to zero amplitudes at infinite time . in this case , a part of the excitation is selftrapped as a result of nonlinearity induced frequency shifts , which tune a localized excitation out of resonance with its surrounding non - excited linear modes .",
    "however , even in the case of strong nonlinearity , subdiffusion of the non - selftrapped part is observed @xcite .",
    "when strong nonlinearities are avoided numerical studies showed a rather universal asymptotic subdiffusive spreading of initial single site excitations @xcite , which is characterized by a growth of the second moment of the wave packet as @xmath0 , with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the selftrapping theorem @xcite holds irrespective of the strength of disorder , therefore it is reflecting the properties of a strongly nonlinear lattice wave equation , rather than peculiarities of waves propagating in disordered media .",
    "also the selftrapping theorem is crucially depending on the presence of at least two integrals of motion , and fails for most nonlinear wave equations with only one integral of motion .    in @xcite the observed wave packet spreading",
    "was assumed to be due to an incoherent excitation of the wave packet exterior , induced by the chaotic dynamics of the wave packet interior .",
    "the number of resonant modes in the packet was estimated by considering from quadruplet and triplet mode - mode interactions @xcite . a generalization to higher dimensions @xmath2 and different nonlinearity powers were performed .",
    "this led to a quantitative prediction for the subdiffusive wave packet spreading characteristics @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "its validity was confirmed numerically in @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been predicted theoretically @xcite and verified numerically @xcite that a potentially long - lasting strong chaos regime induces faster ( though still subdiffusive ) spreading , which is followed by the asymptotic and slower weak chaos subdiffusive spreading .",
    "notably , published numerical data did not report on a further slowing down of spreading , when starting from the weak chaos regime .    in this paper we present results of extensive numerical studies of",
    "wave packet spreading in various models of disordered nonlinear one - dimensional lattices .",
    "in particular , we consider different initial excitations and scan the parameter space of disorder strength and nonlinearity over a wide region .",
    "the main aim is to test the applicability of previously derived spreading laws , and to search for indications of a continuation of the weak chaos spreading , or for indications of a slowing down , as conjectured by others .",
    "in our study we consider various one - dimensional lattice models .",
    "the first one is the disordered discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) described by the hamiltonian function @xmath4 in which @xmath5 are complex variables , @xmath6 are the lattice site indices and @xmath7 is the nonlinearity strength .",
    "the random on - site energies @xmath8 are chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath9 $ ] , with @xmath10 denoting the disorder strength .",
    "the equations of motion are generated by @xmath11 : @xmath12 this above set of equations conserves both the energy of eq .",
    "( [ rdnls ] ) , and the norm @xmath13 .    the second model we consider is the quartic klein - gordon ( kg ) lattice , given as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively are the generalized coordinates and momenta on site @xmath6 , and @xmath17 are chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath19 and yield @xmath20 this set of equations only conserves the energy of eq .",
    "( [ rqkg ] ) .",
    "the scalar measure of energy resulting from eq .",
    "( [ rqkg ] ) we shall henceforth label as @xmath21 .",
    "this scalar value @xmath22 serves as a control parameter of nonlinearity , similar to @xmath23 for the dnls case .    for @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "( [ rdnls - eom ] ) reduces to the linear eigenvalue problem @xmath26 the normalized eigenvectors @xmath27 ( @xmath28 are the corresponding normal modes ( nms ) , and the eigenvalues @xmath29 are the frequencies of these nms .",
    "the width of the eigenfrequency spectrum @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ evequation ] ) is @xmath30 with @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the coefficient @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ rqkg ] ) was chosen so that the linear parts of the hamiltonians , eqs .",
    "( [ rdnls],[rqkg ] ) would correspond to the same eigenvalue problem . in the limit @xmath33 ( in practice by neglecting the nonlinear term @xmath34 ) the kg model of eq .",
    "( [ rqkg ] ) - with @xmath35 - is reduced to the same linear eigenvalue problem of eq .",
    "( [ evequation ] ) , under the substitutions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the width of the squared frequency @xmath38 spectrum is @xmath39 with @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath41 .",
    "as in the case of dnls , @xmath10 determines the disorder strength .",
    "the asymptotic spatial decay of an eigenvector is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the localization length .",
    "in the case of weak disorder , @xmath44 , the localization length is approximated @xcite as @xmath45 . the nm participation number @xmath46 characterizes the spatial extend of the nm .",
    "an average measure of this extent is the localization volume @xmath47 , which is of the order of @xmath48 for weak disorder and unity in the limit of strong disorder , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the average spacing of eigenvalues of nms within the range of a localization volume is then @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the spectrum width .",
    "the two frequency scales @xmath52 determine the packet evolution details in the presence of nonlinearity .    in order to write the equations of motion of hamiltonian ( [ rdnls ] ) in the normal mode space of the system we insert @xmath53 in ( [ rdnls - eom ] ) , with @xmath54 denoting the time - dependent amplitude of the @xmath55th nm .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ evequation ] ) and the orthogonality of nms the equations of motion ( [ rdnls - eom ] ) read @xmath56 with the overlap integral @xmath57 the frequency shift of a single site oscillator induced by the nonlinearity is @xmath58 for the dnls model .",
    "the squared frequency shift of a single site oscillator induced by the nonlinearity for the kg system is @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being the energy of the oscillator .",
    "since all nms are exponentially localized in space , each effectively couples to a finite number of neighbor modes .",
    "the nonlinear interactions are thus of finite range ; however , the strength of this coupling is proportional to the norm ( energy ) density for the dnls ( kg ) model .",
    "if the packet spreads far enough , we can generally define two norm ( energy ) densities : one in real space , @xmath61 ( @xmath60 ) and the other in nm space , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "averaging over realizations , no strong difference is seen between the two , and therefore , we treat them generally as some characteristic norm ( @xmath64 ) or energy ( @xmath65 ) density . the frequency shift due to nonlinearity is then @xmath66 for the dnls model , while the squared frequency shift is @xmath67 for the kg lattice .",
    "the basic characteristics of both models are summarized in table [ tab : char ] .",
    "we order the nms in space by increasing value of the center - of - norm coordinate @xmath68 @xcite . for dnls",
    "we follow normalized norm density distributions @xmath69 with @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the amplitude of the @xmath55th nm and @xmath72 its squared frequency .",
    "we measure the second moment @xmath73 ( with @xmath74 ) , which quantifies the wave packet s spreading width ; the participation number @xmath75 , i.e. the number of the strongest excited modes in @xmath76 ; and the compactness index @xmath77 , which quantifies the inhomogeneity of a wave packet .",
    "thermalized distributions have @xmath78 , while @xmath79 indicates very inhomogeneous packets , e.  g.  sparse ( with many holes ) or partially selftrapped ones ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in addition , following anderson s definition of localization @xcite , we measure the fraction @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) of the wave packet norm ( energy ) in a localization volume @xmath47 around the initially excited state in real space . for a localized state",
    "this fraction asymptotically tends to a constant nonzero value , while it goes to zero in the case of delocalization .      in the limit of strong disorder ( @xmath82 )",
    "the dnls and kg models suffer from increasing computational times needed to observe any nontrivial dynamics .",
    "this is because the eigenvectors tend to single site profiles , i.e.  the overlap integrals become very small .",
    "frhlich , spencer and wayne ( fsw ) suggested considering a modified hamiltonian , which operates directly in normal mode space for the strong disorder limit , but considers artificial rescaled anharmonic interactions between neighboring nms in order to rescale time @xcite : @xmath83 where the nms are equivalent to the single site oscillators .",
    "the nm eigenvalues @xmath84 are considered to be uncorrelated , also for nearest neighbors .",
    "this is different from the dnls and kg models .",
    "also the fsw chain has only pair interactions between nms ( sites ) .",
    "note also that the nonlinear part of the fsw hamiltonian is invariant under any shift @xmath85 , as opposed to the kg model .",
    "we also consider two variants of dnls and kg models with spatially inhomogeneous nonlinearity .",
    "the first type of lattices is composed of linear coupled oscillators except for a central region of length @xmath86 where nonlinearities are present .",
    "we refer to this type as the lnl ( linear - nonlinear - linear ) model .",
    "the second type is called nln ( nonlinear - linear - nonlinear ) and is the exact counterpart of the previous one , since the linear part of the lattice is located at the central @xmath86 sites .",
    "the evolution of wave packets in nonlinear disordered chains can be expected to be selftrapped for strong nonlinearities , or show no selftrapping for weaker nonlinearities .",
    "the existence of the selftrapping regime was theoretically predicted for the dnls model in @xcite ( see also @xcite for more details ) . according to the theorem stated in @xcite , for large enough nonlinearities ( @xmath87 ) single site excitations",
    "can not uniformly spread over the entire lattice .",
    "consequently , a part of the wave packet will remain localized , although the theorem does not prove that the location of this inhomogeneity is constant in time .",
    "if the nonlinear shift @xmath88 moves the frequencies of some of the initially excited oscillators out of the linear spectrum , it tunes them out of resonance and part of the wave packet will be selftrapped . in our study",
    "we consider initial  block ",
    "wave packets , where @xmath86 central oscillators of the lattice are excited having the same norm ( energy ) .",
    "since we consider many random disorder realizations ( of the order of few hundreds ) we expect that , on average , the linear frequencies of the initially excited lattice sites @xmath89 ( @xmath17 ) cover the whole range of permitted values @xmath9 $ ] ( @xmath90 $ ] ) . thus , some of these frequencies are tuned out of resonance if @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "these conditions for the possible appearance of selftrapping are less strict than the theoretically defined ones @xcite and are , in general , in good agreement with numerical simulations . in particular , the selftrapping regime was numerically observed for single - site excitations @xcite and for extended excitations @xcite , both for the dnls and the kg models , despite the fact that the kg system conserves only the total energy @xmath65 , and the selftrapping theorem can not be applied there .",
    "when selftrapping is avoided for @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , two different spreading regimes were predicted , having different dynamical characteristics : an asymptotic weak chaos regime , and a potential intermediate strong chaos one @xcite .",
    "numerical verifications of the existence of these two regimes were presented in @xcite . in the weak chaos regime , for @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "most of the nms are weakly interacting with each other .",
    "then the subdiffusive spreading of the wave packet is characterized by @xmath97 .",
    "if the nonlinearity is weak enough to avoid selftrapping , yet strong enough to ensure @xmath98 , the strong chaos regime is realized .",
    "wave packets in this regime initially spread faster than in the case of weak chaos , with @xmath99 .",
    "since the norm density drops with further spreading , @xmath88 is dropping in time as well , and eventually the wave packet enters the weak chaos regime , where its evolution is characterized by slower spreading with @xmath97 . the wave packet evolution in both the weak and the strong chaos spreading regimes is also expected to be characterized by an increase of the participation number as @xmath100 when @xmath101 .",
    "let as now discuss the spreading of wave packets when @xmath102 .",
    "the packet will initially spread over the localization volume @xmath47 during a time interval @xmath103 , even in the absence of nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "the initial average norm ( energy ) density @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) of the wave packet is then lowered to @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the further spreading of the wave packet in the presence of nonlinearities is then determined by these reduced densities .",
    "note that for single - site excitations ( @xmath108 ) , the strong chaos regime therefore completely disappears and the wave packet evolves either in the weak chaos or in the selftrapping regimes @xcite .",
    "there are no existing theoretical predictions for wave packet dynamics in the fsw chain .",
    "the fsw case can be considered as a strong disorder limit of the kg model , emulating the dynamics of the latter in nm space .",
    "however , in the kg and dnls case , triplet interactions between nms are present and necessary in order to allow for finite ( though small ) resonance probabilities for small ( but finite ) energy and norm densities @xcite .",
    "pair interactions will cease to produce nm resonances for sufficiently small densities due to level repulsion within one localization volume @xcite .",
    "the fsw chain keeps only pair interactions . at the same time ,",
    "level repulsion between neighboring ( interacting ) nms are absent in the fsw case .",
    "therefore , a theoretical analysis similar to the dnls and kg case @xcite appears to be possible .",
    "its details will be considered in a future publication .",
    "the width of the linear spectrum @xmath109 .",
    "the average spacing of nearest neighbor eigenvalues @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we expect that only the asymptotic regime of weak chaos , and the regime of selftrapping can be expected .",
    "the lnl chain can be expected to start in a chaotic wave packet spreading regime as long as the wave packet is confined mainly to the finite size n ( nonlinear ) part .",
    "however , the more the wave packet spreads , the more it extends into the infinitely extended l ( linear ) parts .",
    "resonances and chaos are therefore confined to the finite n part . since distant nms in the l part are exponentially weakly interacting with the chaotic nms in the n part , their excitation - if at all - will take times which increase exponentially with growing distance .",
    "therefore , the wave packet will spread ( if at all ) slower than any power law .",
    "thus , the lnl model is the only model we consider here , where almost trivial slowing down of spreading is expected .",
    "recently , the dynamics of a similar system was theoretically investigated in @xcite , where a disordered subsystem of coupled anharmonic oscillators , linearly coupled to an infinite harmonic system , was considered . in this work",
    "the conditions which permit the persistence of the discrete breather of the isolated anharmonic system for small but nonvanishing couplings to the harmonic lattice were derived , and cases characterized by energy transfer to the harmonic system were also discussed .    the nln chain is expected to behave differently .",
    "as long as the wave packet is confined mainly to the l region , the dynamics is regular , and no spreading should occur .",
    "for large enough time , some part of the packet will leak out into the n regions .",
    "therefore , finally spreading of the wave packet should occur .",
    "we consider compact dnls wave packets at @xmath111 spanning a width @xmath86 centered in the lattice , such that within @xmath86 there is a constant initial norm of @xmath112 and a random phase at each site , while outside the width @xmath86 the norm density is zero . in the kg case",
    ", we excite each site in the width @xmath86 with the same energy , @xmath113 , i.e.  initial momenta of @xmath114 with randomly assigned signs .",
    "we use symplectic integration schemes of the saba family of integrators @xcite for the integration of equations ( [ rdnls - eom ] ) and ( [ kg - eom ] ) .",
    "the particular symplectic scheme used for the dnls model is described in the appendix .",
    "the number of lattice sites @xmath115 and the integration time step @xmath116 varied between @xmath117 to @xmath118 and @xmath119 to @xmath120 , in order to exclude finite size effects in the wave packet evolution , and in order to reach long integration times up to @xmath121 time units with feasible cpu times . in all our simulations , the relative energy and norm errors",
    "are kept smaller than @xmath122 . for each parameter",
    "set we averaged our data over @xmath123 different disorder realizations , unless otherwise stated , and denote this by @xmath124 .",

    "[ fig_kg_hybrid](a ) ) and the participation number ( fig .",
    "[ fig_kg_hybrid](b ) ) start to grow after some detrapping time @xmath168 .",
    "this time is larger than the detrapping time of the kg model ( @xmath214 ) , because a wave packet in the kg - nln model initially evolves in an almost linear system and only after some large time , when it has spread significantly to the nonlinear part of the lattice , spreading takes on characteristics of the purely nonlinear model .    on the other hand the evolution of all quantities of fig .",
    "[ fig_kg_hybrid ] for the kg - lnl system ( red curves ) follows the kg model until @xmath215 , because initially the wave packets evolve in the same nonlinear system .",

    "thus , spreading starts to retard , and both @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_kg_hybrid](a ) ) and @xmath211 ( fig .  [ fig_kg_hybrid](b ) ) show a characteristic slowing down in the exponents @xmath140 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_kg_hybrid](d ) ) and @xmath141 ( fig .  [ fig_kg_hybrid](e ) ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath145 ( fig .  [ fig_kg_hybrid](f ) ) saturates at finite non - zero values , indicating that wave packets tend to localize again . for all three kg models ,",
    "the values of @xmath154 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_kg_hybrid](c ) ) show that wave packets do not become sparse and inhomogeneous in the course of time .",
    "we obtained similar results for the lnl and nln dnls models for @xmath130 , @xmath146 and @xmath139 .",
    "thus , also for the lnl and nln models spreading is observed , and only in the case of the lnl models we have observed a slowing down of the spreading , as expected .",
    "we considered several models of disordered nonlinear one - dimensional lattices and performed extensive numerical simulations of norm ( energy ) propagations .",
    "since we focused on the dynamical spreading of fronts , we prepared initial block wave packet profiles , having widths equal or larger than the average localization volume defined by the linear problem . while not performed , we expect similar behaviors for initial gaussian profiles , again where the width ( for gaussians , say the standard deviation ) is on par with the average localization volume .",
    "we carefully studied statistical properties of the dynamics , by varying the values of disorder and nonlinearity strengths over a wide interval , and by averaging results over many disorder realizations .",
    "our results agree quite well with our theoretical expectations for the existence of the weak and strong chaos regimes .",
    "the main outcome of our study is that in the presence of nonlinearities we always observe subdiffusive spreading , so that the second moment grows initially as @xmath216 with @xmath217 , showing signs of a crossover to the asymptotic @xmath97 law at larger times .",
    "remarkably , subdiffusive spreading is also observed for large disorder strengths , when the localization volume ( which defines the number of interacting partner modes ) tends to one .",
    "frhlich - spencer - wayne models which take the disorder strength to its infinite limits , are also showing subdiffusive growth .",
    "most remarkably , in none of our studies ( except the artificial lnl case ) did we encounter a slowing down of spreading beyond the limits set by the weak chaos predictions .",
    "therefore , our numerical data support the conjecture , that the wave packets , once they spread , will do so up to infinite times in a subdiffusive way , bypassing anderson localization of the linear wave equations .",
    "the only cases where spreading shows a tendency to stop are the lnl models , for which nonlinearities are absent everywhere except inside a finite - size central region , where the initial wave packet is launched . in these models ,",
    "when wave packets have spread substantially , their chaotic component in the central region of the lattice becomes weak , and distant normal modes in the linear parts of the system are exponentially weakly coupled to the central nonlinear region .",
    "when the nonlinearity strength tends to smaller values , waiting ( detrapping ) times for wave packet spreading of compact initial excitations increase beyond the detection capabilities of our computational tools . the corresponding question of whether a kam regime can be entered at finite nonlinearity strength was addressed in @xcite and is analyzed in detail in a forthcoming work @xcite .",

    "previously used methods employ a transformation of the wave function from real into fourier space and back , at each integration step .",
    "these transformations induce small but observable corrections in the tails of the wave packet , which slowly but steadily grow in time . in such a case",
    "we will have to stop the integration once this noisy background reaches a substantial level .",
