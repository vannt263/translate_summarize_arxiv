    "stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) is a nonlinear and self - amplifying interaction between guided optical waves and hypersound waves in waveguides  @xcite .",
    "the scattering of light from mechanical vibrations was first predicted by brillouin in 1922  @xcite ; the stimulated version of this process was first experimentally demonstrated  @xcite shortly after the invention of the laser by chiao et al . and",
    "has since been used successfully to characterize materials at hypersonic frequencies  @xcite . following the general trend of miniaturization ,",
    "sbs has been studied and applied in ever smaller structures such as nano - structured optical fibres  @xcite and even waveguides integrated on a chip  @xcite . in these systems",
    "sbs ceases to be a bulk effect and surface effects strongly come into play  most prominently radiation pressure appears as a second major interaction process in addition to the bulk photoelastic effect . due to this additional coupling as well as the very tight mode confinement ,",
    "high sbs - gains can be achieved in integrated waveguides  @xcite , which makes them extremely interesting for signal processing applications  @xcite as well as narrow linewidth light sources  @xcite .",
    "recently the idea of coherent phonon generation in phonon - lasers has gained considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "however , all these potential applications require or at least greatly benefit from the extremely narrow linewidth of the sbs process ; line width broadening is highly detrimental in many cases  @xcite .",
    "this motivates our investigation of the inhomogeneous line broadening due to structural variations of the waveguide and potential connections to the sbs - gain itself .",
    "the finite phonon life time ( or equivalently in backward sbs : the phonon propagation length ) defines an intrinsic line width of the sbs - resonance .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that various imperfections of the sbs - system can distort the resonance and inhomogeneously broaden it . some of these imperfections such as insufficient acoustic guidance in combination with moderate optical mode confinement  @xcite ( one possible explanation for sbs broadening in optical fibres , but somewhat debated in this context ) or simply the finite length of suspended nanowires  @xcite are inherent to some waveguide designs and can not be avoided .",
    "in addition , local deviations from the intended ideal geometry can always lead to local variations in the stokes shift . as a result ,",
    "the total sbs - response of a non - ideal waveguide is the convolution of the intrinsic resonance and the stokes frequency distribution along the waveguide .",
    "incidentally , the geometry - dependence of the local stokes shift has been used to measure the homogeneity of optical fibres  @xcite and to increase the sbs - threshold  @xcite . however , to date no connection has been made between the sbs - gain and the sensitivity of the stokes shift , although this is suggested by the close connection between sbs and opto - mechanics  @xcite , in which in turn the coupling strength is known to be closely related to the deformation - sensitivity of the optical subsystem  @xcite .    ) and an optical probe ( superscript @xmath0 ) excite a sound wave inside a waveguide that is assumed to be smooth , but whose geometry is smoothly and slowly perturbed along the axis of propagation , the @xmath1-axis .",
    "other cases studied in this manuscript include forward sbs and inhomogeneous strain fields ( due to temperature gradients or lattice mismatch ) instead of the sketched geometry variations . , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the aim of this paper is to understand the impact of smooth and slowly varying perturbations of the waveguide structure ( as sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] ) .",
    "we include variations of the waveguide geometry and internal strain fields that change smoothly along the waveguide and on a length scale greater than the acoustic decay length .",
    "this is opposed to surface roughness , which is usually a major concern in fabrication , since it causes linear optical propagation loss via rayleigh scattering  in backward sbs an analogous scattering of mechanical waves also contributes to the acoustic loss .",
    "in contrast , adiabatic structural variations do not scatter travelling waves and do not cause linear loss . however , they locally modify the dispersion relations and thereby influence the relative phase between the three waves participating in the sbs - process . here",
    ", we show that one mechanism for this is through the optical dispersion relation and the sensitivity is closely connected to the sbs - gain , whereas the second mechanism is via the mechanical dispersion relation and completely independent from the sbs - gain .",
    "we show that these two mechanisms influence forward and backward sbs quite differently and that increasing the sbs - gain either by increasing the acousto - optic coupling or reducing the mechanical damping leads to a regime where the line width is dominated by structural variations .",
    "the total sbs - response is then reduced to the square root of the intrinsic sbs - gain .",
    "we derive our results rigorously within the classical variant of a recent hamiltonian formulation of sbs  @xcite .    throughout this manuscript",
    "we adhere to the notation and conventions introduced in our earlier paper on coupled - mode theory of sbs  @xcite . in section  [ sec : qualitative ] , we qualitatively describe the relation between sbs and the sensitivity of the dispersion relations and the resulting impact on the sbs - resonance .",
    "although very useful for an intuitive understanding , this discussion lacks the quantitative precision of the formal derivation provided in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "the results of that section are then analytically studied in section  [ sec : discussion ] , focusing on the two important special cases of backward sbs and intra - mode forward sbs .",
    "next , we study the relative importance of the two broadening mechanisms in forward and backward sbs in section  [ sec : numerics ] using a family of suspended silicon nanowires as an example and find that they can compensate each other in appropriately engineered waveguides .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarises and concludes the paper .",
    "the double - arrow highlights the opto - acoustic transition that fulfils the conservation of both energy and momentum .",
    "the solid lines represent the dispersion relations of the ideal system and the dashed lines those of the perturbed system .",
    "the light pink lines are parallels of the respective left side optical branches and indicate which acoustic wave number is phase matched .",
    "note that the magnitude of @xmath2 is grossly exaggerated compared to @xmath3 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the acoustic properties of a waveguide are modified by static structural perturbations via mechanical nonlinearities , which are usually not relevant for the dynamics of optically generated sound waves .",
    "more precisely , there are separate contributions from internal strain fields and from variations of the cross section .",
    "strain fields enter via the nonlinear relation between stiffness and stress : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the strain and stress tensors , @xmath7 is the conventional linear stiffness tensor and @xmath8 is a second order nonlinear stiffness tensor ( see section  [ sec : theory ] ) . at the same time , internal strain fields also modify the mass density distribution , because the trace of the strain tensor corresponds to a volume dilatation .",
    "finally , changes in the cross section geometry cause a change in the boundary conditions ( to be more specific : in the position of the boundary , not in the type of condition imposed there ) of the acoustic helmholtz equation . as an example , a slight reduction of the waveguide width might increase or decrease the acoustic frequency @xmath9 depending on whether the acoustic mode is predominantly longitudinal or transversal and on whether the boundaries are approximately free or clamped .    at the same time , structural perturbations",
    "modify the optical properties of the waveguide .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned acoustic frequency shift this modification is closely related to the sbs - process , which consists of two complementary nonlinear processes : the acoustic wave is excited by optical forces that are created by the beat of the optical pump and stokes waves .",
    "the sound wave spatio - temporally varies the waveguide s optical properties and modulates the pump wave such that the stokes side band is amplified .",
    "it is clear that the second process can only be efficient if the waveguide s dispersion relation is sensitive to small mechanical perturbations ; if it was insensitive the acoustic wave would not modulate the pump wave .",
    "this can not be compensated by a stronger excitation of the sound wave ( neglecting irreversible forces ) , because both processes are described by the same mode overlap integral , hence are equally strong .",
    "however , the optical dispersion relation can not distinguish between static and dynamic ( acoustic ) mechanical perturbations .",
    "therefore , the optical properties of any waveguide that exhibits strong sbs are intrinsically sensitive to small structural perturbations introduced in the fabrication process .",
    "more precisely , waveguides whose sbs is mainly caused by photoelasticity are predominantly sensitive to internal strain fields , caused by inhomogeneous cooling of the sample , whereas waveguides whose sbs is mainly caused by radiation pressure are predominantly sensitive to slight variations of the waveguide cross section .",
    "the variation of the optical dispersion relation occurs as a function of @xmath1 rather than time , breaking the conservation of optical momentum .",
    "therefore , this variation results in a change in the optical wave numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 while leaving the optical frequencies unchanged . as a result ,",
    "the pump frequency @xmath3 is exactly constant along the waveguide and the frequency @xmath12 of the perfectly phase - matched stokes wave varies only as a result of variations in the acoustic frequency @xmath9 .",
    "these optical wave number variations translate to variations of the acoustic wave number through the momentum matching condition @xmath13 therefore , the optical dispersion relation sensitivity indirectly affects the acoustic frequency .",
    "this effect has been practically applied in certain types of sbs - based fibre sensors  @xcite . the total local change in the acoustic frequency",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_matching ] ) is given by the combination of the optical wave number variations and the direct acoustic shift @xmath14 described earlier : @xmath15 it should be noted at this point that the two contributions to the total frequency change can have opposite sign and therefore cancel ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : numerics ] for an example ) .        in a waveguide that is subject to inhomogeneous variations of the geometry and strain fields",
    "the acoustic frequency variation becomes a function of the position @xmath1 within the waveguide .",
    "it is instructive to imagine the waveguide to be composed of many short and approximately homogeneous sections ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : broadening ] ) .",
    "each such section acts as an independent sbs - amplifier with a stokes frequency that is offset from the ideal by @xmath16 .",
    "all other properties such as intrinsic line width and differential sbs - gain ( the sbs gain per unit length of waveguide measured in units of @xmath17 ) can be assumed to be unchanged .",
    "the total sbs - spectrum of the complete waveguide is then simply the superposition of the individual sbs - spectra . in the limit of very short homogeneous sections , within an undepleted pump approximation and assuming a lorentzian intrinsic resonance shape , the stokes amplification on resonance is then the integral : @xmath18 ^ 2 } ,    \\label{eqn : qualitative_superposition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 represents the phonon life time and the waveguide is assumed to extend from @xmath20 to @xmath21 . within the integral",

    "if the distribution @xmath16 has a width of the order @xmath27 and especially if it is lopsided , the sbs - resonance is inhomogeneously broadened into a non - lorentzian shape as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : broadening ] .",
    "so far , we have qualitatively explained the two main effects of structural variations on the sbs - resonance : perturbations to the acoustic and the optical dispersion relation and we have furthermore argued that the magnitude of the latter effect must be closely related to the sbs - gain . for practical purposes , it is probably sufficient to compute @xmath14 and @xmath28 numerically and insert them into eqs .",

    "[ fig : example_fsbs ] demonstrates that the geometry sensitivity of fsbs is only a response to size variations of a transverse acoustic resonator .",
    "in addition , we have also computed broadened fsbs spectra of the first mode ( computed frequency shift : @xmath158 at a width of @xmath151 ) .",
    "[ fig : num_resonance_shapes ] shows the impact of a width variation of @xmath159 . this is a little less than two lattice constants of the silicon crystal",

    "[ fig : num_resonance_shapes ] also illustrates the effect of different distributions of width variations along the waveguide .",
    "the leftmost panel shows the unperturbed spectrum assuming a mechanical quality factor of @xmath148 , which is a realistic value for certain fsbs experiments  @xcite where mechanical loss is dominated by acoustic leakage .",
    "the center panel shows the broadened spectrum assuming that the waveguide length linearly changes along the total waveguide length ( typically several millimetres to centimetres ) ; as a result the quality factor significantly drops to @xmath160 .",
    "the rightmost panel finally shows the broadened spectrum assuming that the waveguide width fluctuates sinusoidally along the waveguide with a period that is large compared to the acoustic decay length and the optical wave length ( the exact periodicity does not matter ) . in this case , not only is the quality factor further reduced to @xmath161 , but the resonance is also deformed into a highly non - lorentzian shape with two distinct peaks .",
    "this example shows that high effective quality factors in integrated sbs require very consistent fabrication down to the atom level .     at a mechanical quality factor of @xmath148 ,",

    "the three panels show the unperturbed resonance ( left panel ) , the line for the case that the width linearly varies from @xmath162 to @xmath163 over the waveguide length ( center panel ) and for the case that the waveguide width is sinusoidally undulated between the values @xmath162 and @xmath163 . in both cases",
    ", the perturbation reduces the quality factor by about a factor of two .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    for bsbs , the situation is slightly more complicated , because the indirect ( optical ) perturbation contributes to the total sensitivity .",
    "therefore , we additionally determined the impact of the direct contribution by solving the acoustic problem for the perturbed geometry and the wave number derived from the unperturbed problem ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : example_bsbs ] ) ; the indirect ( optical ) contribution ( squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : example_bsbs ] ) then follows as the difference .",
    "both studied acoustic modes are hybrid and have an axial wave length that is comparable to the waveguide s dimensions .",
    "therefore , the acoustic frequency is roughly determined by the bulk speed of sound and the wave number .",
    "the displacement field of the first acoustic mode has appreciable @xmath164-components , which leads to a noticeable direct ( acoustic ) sensitivity .",
    "in contrast , the second mode is mostly insensitive to the direct perturbation effect .",
    "both acoustic modes are very susceptible to the indirect ( optical ) perturbation effect .",
    "for example , the second acoustic mode responds to a width variation of @xmath147 with a resonance shift of up to @xmath165 .",
    "correspondingly , a waveguide with a width of @xmath150 would have to be manufactured to better than @xmath166 ( less than a monolayer of atoms ) along its entire length in order to maintain an overall quality factor of @xmath167 .",
    "evidence for this problem has been observed experimentally  @xcite",
    ".    one interesting detail of fig .",
    "[ fig : example_bsbs ] is the fact that the direct and indirect contributions to the inhomogeneous broadening can be of comparable magnitude .",
    "furthermore , they will tend to have opposite signs , because an increase in waveguide width tunes the transverse acoustic resonator to lower frequencies via the direct ( acoustic ) perturbation mechanism , while an increase in the width also leads to higher optical mode indices , corresponding to greater wave numbers and eventually higher acoustic frequencies via the indirect ( optical ) perturbation mechanism .",
    "this suggests the very promising idea to design a waveguide structure with a deliberately _ strong _ direct sensitivity in order to cancel the inevitable indirect sensitivity . the result would be a waveguide design with greatly relaxed fabrication tolerances with respect to the waveguide width .",
    "the general applicability of this concept to minimise the sensitivity with respect to one design parameter ( in this case the width ) is proven by the behavior of mode 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : example_bsbs ] .",
    "there , the direct and indirect contributions for width variations nearly cancel for small waveguide widths . however , the presented mode is only of academic interest because of its very low sbs power gain .",
    "finally , it should be noted that only one specific type of perturbations ( e.g. width variations , wall angle variations or height variations ) can be compensated with this technique while potentially increasing the sensitivity of the other perturbation types .     crystal direction .",
    "in contrast to fsbs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : example_fsbs ] ) , both studied acoustic modes involve axial and in - plane components .",
    "furthermore , bsbs features both the direct ( acoustic ) process ( with negative sign as for fsbs ) and in addition the indirect ( optical ) process with the opposite sign .",
    "the former can be neglected for wider waveguides ; however , it is possible that both contributions cancel each other . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : example_fsbs ] we annotated the power gain , this time assuming a quality factor of @xmath167",
    ". the extremely low power gain of mode 1 is caused by nearly exact u cancellation of the photoelastic and moving - boundary related coupling in this structure . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have analysed the sensitivity of the optical and acoustic dispersion relations on structural variations of a waveguide and related this to the sensitivity of the stokes shift @xmath9 .",
    "we have shown that variations of the optical dispersion relation are a major source of inhomogeneous broadening in backward sbs and that they are intimately related to the forward sbs coupling , because slowly and smoothly varying perturbations mainly modify the phase of an optical mode , and induce negligible back - scattering .",
    "this leads to a counter - intuitive result in sbs dominated by radiation pressure ( see section  [ sec : rad_bsbs ] ) : since the inhomogeneous broadening is proportional to the forward sbs coupling ( square root of fsbs - gain ) , the maximum of a strongly broadened sbs spectrum is proportional to the ratio of the backward gain and the square root of the forward gain . as a result",
    "the maximum of the strongly broadened response of a backward sbs system scales only with the square root of the naively expected sbs - gain .",
    "this means that high - gain backward sbs waveguides are intrinsically sensitive to fabricational imperfections and require fabricational tolerances matched not only to the intrinsic acoustic line width but also to the opto - acoustic coupling strength .",
    "therefore , it may be advisable in practice to sacrifice some intrinsic sbs - gain to avoid the tolerance - dominated regime , especially since this might reduce the linear or nonlinear optical loss at the same time and thereby increase the overall figure of merit .",
    "we have furthermore shown that the indirect resonance sensitivity is absent in forward sbs and that therefore no fundamental link between the resonance sensitivity and the sbs - gain exists in this case .",
    "nonetheless , the direct ( acoustic ) resonance sensitivity can be appreciable and has been observed in at least one nanophotonic realisation of forward sbs  @xcite .",
    "our numerical example for fsbs is in excellent agreement with this experiment .",
    "finally , we have argued that the direct ( acoustic ) and indirect ( optical ) contributions to the resonance sensitivity tend to have opposite sign .",
    "this allows one to design comparatively insensitive high - gain waveguides with a strong direct sensitivity carefully engineered to compensate the intrinsic indirect sensitivity .",
