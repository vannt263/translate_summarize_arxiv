    "the study of logarithmic conformal field theories ( lcfts ) through their lattice realizations has proven to be useful in the past few years .",
    "the main features of such quantum field theories are indeed already present when one considers _",
    "non - local _ observables in usual statistical systems at their critical point  such as geometrical properties of self - avoiding walks or percolation clusters .",
    "the description of such observables has led to the extension of the minimal models into non - rational theories , including observables described not only by irreducible virasoro representations , but also by larger indecomposable , yet reducible , representations .",
    "indecomposability is the main feature of a logarithmic cft . in general",
    ", it leads to non - diagonalizability of the dilatation operator @xmath0 and to logarithmic singularities in correlation functions .",
    "applications of lcfts range from disordered systems in condensed matter physics to string theory  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional geometrical problems such as percolation or self - avoiding walks provide probably the most natural examples of lcfts with central charge @xmath1 .",
    "more interestingly maybe , lcfts are expected to appear in disordered critical points  @xcite . in particular , critical points of non - interacting fermions in 2 + 1 dimensions are believed to be described by logarithmic @xmath1 theories .",
    "this is the case for example in the transition between plateaux in the integer quantum hall effect ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) or in its cousin , related to the percolation problem , the spin quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "another example of interesting disordered critical point is provided by the random - bond ising model at the nishimori point , whose underlying cft is still unknown ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the modern language of random non - interacting fermionic systems",
    ", this problem is closely related to the so - called class  d of symmetry , with broken time reversal and no spin - rotation symmetry  @xcite . on a very different matter , 2d super - symmetric sigma models ( on compact kahler manifolds ) beyond the topological sector and 4d gauge theories  @xcite",
    "provide other interesting physical applications of lcfts .",
    "lcfts probably also play an important role in the ads / cft correspondence , as they describe massless limit of non - linear sigma models with non - compact target spaces ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . besides concrete physical applications",
    ", lcfts attracted recently considerable interest in the mathematics community  @xcite as well .",
    "a fundamental question about lcfts is to determine the operator product expansions ( opes ) of their quantum fields .",
    "thanks to the conformal symmetry , the opes are essentially determined by the fusion rules for the corresponding modules over the virasoro algebra .",
    "mainly , two different direct lines of attack have been pursued to tackle the problem of computing fusion rules .",
    "the first one , which is probably the most straightforward , uses the the so - called nahm  gaberdiel ",
    "kausch ( ngk ) algorithm  @xcite based on ` geometrical ' comultiplication for virasoro generators  @xcite .",
    "this approach was applied to many ( chiral ) lcfts like percolation with success  @xcite .",
    "the usual output of the repeated fusion consists in _ staggered _ modules  @xcite which are indecomposable virasoro modules with a diamond - shape subquotient structure and non - diagonalizable action of the @xmath0 generator .",
    "the systematic study of these staggered modules was achieved recently in  @xcite .",
    "the second approach is to consider lattice regularizations of lcfts using 2d statistical systems  @xcite or 1 + 1d quantum spin chains  @xcite at their critical point .",
    "this is strongly motivated by the known regularization of the stress - energy tensor in terms of temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra generators  @xcite .",
    "this `` lattice '' approach also relies on the similarity between the representation theory of the associative algebras on the lattice side and that of the virasoro algebra in the continuum .",
    "as it turns out , the structure of the projective tl modules mimics exactly that of some staggered modules over virasoro . to be more precise",
    ", one can construct an inductive system of categories of tl modules with terms labeled by the number of sites in the spin - chain , the inductive limit then belongs to the category of virasoro modules .",
    "the study of such `` lattice '' algebras then allows to understand the complicated structure of the continuum limit .",
    "this was partially done in  @xcite and independently , with less emphasize on algebraic aspects , in the work  @xcite .",
    "using quantum - group considerations , the authors of  @xcite were able to obtain several fusion rules for the projective tl modules .",
    "meanwhile , many consistent fusion rules were conjectured using both lattice considerations  @xcite and their combination with the ngk algorithm  @xcite .",
    "both approaches yield a consistent picture of chiral lcfts",
    ". however , to the best of our knowledge there is lack of a clear , well - defined framework to compute fusion from lattice models in a systematic and effective way , without relying on the somewhat cumbersome ngk algorithm .    in this paper",
    ", we consider 1 + 1d quantum spin chains with heisenberg nearest - neighbor interaction given by tl generators . such systems admit a large symmetry ( or tl centralizing ) algebra given by a representation of the quantum group @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this provides the well - known quantum version of the classical schur ",
    "weyl duality between the symmetric group action and its centralizer @xmath3 .",
    "we revisit and generalize the fusion procedure suggested in  @xcite using recent results on quantum groups  @xcite at roots of unity cases .",
    "we obtain rigorously the fusion rules for standard , irreducible , and projective modules over the temperley - lieb algebra at any root of unity .",
    "these results are also supported by very simple lattice calculations on a few sites . using these exact lattice results , we conjecture general fusion rules for virasoro modules and interpret them physically in terms of the fields that appear in the continuum limit of our lattice models .",
    "interestingly , these fusion calculations parallel a well known approach that consists in considering lcfts as limits of ordinary , non - logarithmic , cfts  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a similar discussion in the language of replicas ) . within this approach ,",
    "logarithms and indecomposability arise to compensate for divergent terms in opes as one goes to logarithmic ( or critical ) points .",
    "we note that the existence and uniqueness of logarithmic opes ( including the associativity condition ) were actually stated , as a theorem , in the fundamental serie of papers  @xcite .",
    "we believe our lattice description of fusion provides a very natural lattice regularization of such indecomposable ( logarithmic ) opes .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that there is another , though more abstract and less straightforward , approach to compute fusion rules for modules over virasoro ( and its extended cousins like triplet @xmath4-algebras and affine lie algebras ) based on the so - called kazhdan  lusztig ( kl ) correspondence .",
    "the paradigm here is coming from a belief that to any vertex - operator algebra , one can associate a quantum group with an `` equivalent '' representation theory including fusion rules data .",
    "a first example of such an equivalence was established between affine @xmath5 at a negative integer level and a quantum group at a root of unity case  @xcite . while in rational cfts there are also strong connections between fusion rules and braiding structures for quantum - group and virasoro modules  @xcite , similar correspondences",
    "were also observed in the context of affine @xmath5 modules with positive integer level  @xcite . in the logarithmic cases , examples of kl correspondences",
    "were also established in the triplet @xmath4-algebra context  @xcite and in the virasoro context  @xcite . here ,",
    "the construction of corresponding quantum groups is based on the screening charges in a free - field realization and the quantum groups are identified with full symmetry algebras ( centralizers ) of the chiral algebras .",
    "this approach is probably less straightforward than the other two mentioned above ( see nevertheless recent successes  @xcite clarifying this direction ) but it shares strong similarities with the lattice approach here and in  @xcite where the main computational tool relies on the centralizer concept as well , _",
    "i.e. _ , is provided by the quantum version of the schur ",
    "weyl duality .",
    "we thus believe that our paper is a further step towards the understanding the kl correspondences .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows .",

    ", our results will apply only to virasoro modules with conformal weights lying in the first row of the infinite kac table ( for an analog continuum construction , see  @xcite ) .      for convenience ,",

    "one can understand in this way the fusion by considering the limit of generic results , where we see that the kac modules get glued together at logarithmic points , forming a maximal number of staggered modules in order to cancel divergent terms in opes .",
    "another fusion rule that has interesting consequences on the underlying field theory is given by the fusion of projective @xmath10-modules .",
    "it seems rather clear that the field associated with the virasoro staggered module @xmath471 really is @xmath570 in  .",
    "when @xmath471 appears in a given fusion of kac modules for example , this means that the logarithmic field @xmath571 is generated , along with its descendants ( generated by the action of the @xmath179 s on @xmath571 , where @xmath572 can be positive ) like @xmath573 , @xmath567 or @xmath574 .",

    "this multiplicity could be interpreted as the existence of two different isomorphic copies of @xmath518 in the theory , on the other hand , one would like to have only one identity operator and one stress energy tensor in a reasonable cft . using the ope approach , one can see that there are two channels that contribute to @xmath518 in the fusion , that is , that generate the field @xmath161 .",
    "indeed , using  , we see that the fields @xmath528 and @xmath516 in the ope @xmath586 are coming from three different contributions @xmath597 , and @xmath598 , and @xmath599 . in terms of generic fusion , this is because the generic version of   reads @xmath600 , where one can already see the multiplicity @xmath94 at this point .",
    "therefore , we should just sum the amplitudes corresponding to each channel for @xmath528 and @xmath516 and we thus do not think this multiplicity should be interpreted as two different fields @xmath601 and @xmath602 .",
    "we finally note that although we mainly focused in this paper on theories with central charge @xmath195 and with conformal weights lying in the first row of the kac table @xmath21 , several simple extensions of our work are possible .",
    "the study of `` dilute '' models ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) would enable us to reach conformal weights @xmath603 in the first column of the kac table .",
    "the underlying algebra would be in this case a dilute version of @xmath10 .",
    "another option would be to consider the transformation @xmath604 in the hamiltonian of the xxz spin chain , this corresponds to @xmath605 in the tl algebra .",
    "the scaling limit of such models are described by the so - called @xmath7 theories , with central charge @xmath606 .",
    "the self - contragredient projective tl modules in this case also converge to staggered virasoro modules in the limit , but their subquotient structure is slightly different with respect to the @xmath607 theories due to disappearance of the irreducible tl subquotients @xmath15 , for @xmath608 , which were the `` minimal - models '' contributions in the @xmath607 theories .",
    "the structure of staggered modules in the @xmath7 theories appeared in many papers  @xcite , see also references therein , and we do not repeat it here .",
    "it turns out that our results about fusion of kac and staggered modules in these theories agrees with those conjectured in  @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we believe that the fusion functor studied in this paper is a very powerful tool . fusion in logarithmic cfts is usually studied through the so - called nahm ",
    "kausch algorithm  @xcite which is considerably more involved than the simple - minded lattice calculations on a few sites that we performed throughout the examples of this paper",
    ". moreover , if the @xmath9-schur  weyl duality and the correspondence with @xmath2 tensor products may appear quite technical to the reader , this approach provides general rigorous results for the lattice fusion thus avoiding tentative conjectures based on calculations performed for a few examples on a small number of sites .",
    "we also think that our paper provides the correct algebraic framework to understand and interpret the results of  @xcite and we wish to emphasize the crucial importance of algebraic methods to understand the connection between `` lattice '' associative algebras and the virasoro algebra .",
    "our result are nicely illustrated by ope calculations performed in the corresponding lcfts .",
    "these logarithmic opes are strongly similar to lattice fusion calculations , where indecomposable points are approached as _ limit _ of results obtained in semi - simple ( generic ) cases .",
    "this suggests that this concept of _ limit _ is crucial , and could become an important tool in the near future both on the lattice side and in the field theory .",
    "an interesting task would be to apply the construction of intertwining operators in  @xcite to our `` moduli space '' of cfts and take the limit in a rigorous manner .",
    "it would be most certainly interesting to generalize these results to other boundary conditions in order to explore other regions of the kac table than the first row . a careful understanding of the connection between the boundary extensions of the tl algebra ( see _ e.g. _",
