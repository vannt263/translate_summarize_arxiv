    "recently much interest is given for high - density qcd , especially for quark cooper - pair condensation phenomena at high - density quark matter ( called as color superconductivity ( csc ) ) , in connection with , e.g. , physics of heavy ion collisions and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "its mechanism is similar to the bcs theory for the electron - phonon system @xcite , in which the attractive interaction of electrons is provided by phonon exchange and causes the cooper instability near the fermi surface . as for quark matter",
    ", the quark - quark interaction is mediated by colored gluons , and is often approximated by some effective interactions , e.g. , the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) or the instanton - induced interaction , both of which give rise to the attractive quark - quark interaction in the color anti - symmetric @xmath0 channel .",
    "csc leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking of color @xmath1 into @xmath2 as a result of condensation of quark cooper pairs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to address another phenomenon expected in quark matter : spin polarization or ferromagnetism of quark matter .",
    "we examine the possibility of the spin - polarized phase with csc in quark matter .",
    "as far as we know , interplay between the color superconducting phase and other phases characterized by the non - vanishing mean fields of the spinor bilinears @xmath3 has not been explored except for the case of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "our main concern here is to investigate the possibility of the quark cooper instability under the axial - vector mean - field , @xmath4 which is responsible for spin polarization of quark matter",
    ". it would be worth mentioning in this context that ferromagnetism ( or spin polarization ) and superconductivity are fundamental concepts in condensed matter physics , and their coexistent phase has been discussed for a long time @xcite . as a recent progress , a superconducting phase have been discovered in ferromagnetic materials and many efforts have been made to understand the coexisting mechanism @xcite .    besides being interesting in its own right , the coexistence problem may be related to some physical phenomena . recently",
    ", a new type of neutron stars , called as `` magnetars '' , with a super strong magnetic field of @xmath5 g ) has been discovered @xcite .",
    "they may raise an interesting question for the origin of the magnetic field in compact stars , since its strength is too large to regard it as a successor from progenitor stars , unlike canonical neutron stars @xcite . since hadronic matter spreads over inside neutron stars beyond the nuclear density ( @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 )",
    ", it should be interesting to consider the microscopic origin of the magnetic field in magnetars .",
    "in this context , a possibility of ferromagnetism in quark matter due to the oge interaction has been suggested by one of the authors ( t.t . ) within a variational framework @xcite ; a competition between the kinetic and the fock exchange energies gives rise to spin polarization , similarly to bloch s idea for itinerant electrons .",
    "salient features of spin polarization in the relativistic system are also discussed in ref .",
    "thus , it might be also interesting to examine the possibility of the spin - polarized phase with csc in quark matter , in connection with magnetars .",
    "we investigate spin polarization in the color superconducting phase by a self - consistent framework , in which quark cooper pairs are formed under the axial - vector mean - field .",
    "we shall see that this phenomenon is a manifestation of spontaneous breaking of both color @xmath1 and rotation symmetries .",
    "we adopt here the oge interaction as an effective quark - quark interaction .",
    "since the fermi momentum is very large at high density , asymptotic freedom of qcd implies that the interaction between quarks is very weak @xcite .",
    "so it may be reasonable to think that the oge interaction has a dominant contribution for the quark - quark interaction . in the framework of relativistic mean - field theories ,",
    "the axial - vector and tensor mean - fields , which stem from the fock exchange terms , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , may have a central role to split the degenerate single - particle energies of the two spin states , and then leads to spin polarization , e.g. , see @xcite for discussion in nuclear matter . as for quark matter , several types of the color singlet mean - fields appear after the fierz transformation in the fock exchange terms , but we retain only the axial - vector mean - field as the origin of spin polarization , because the oge interaction by no means holds the tensor mean - field due to chiral symmetry in qcd , unlike nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "presence of the axial - vector mean - field deforms the quark fermi seas according to their spin degrees of freedom , and thereby the gap function should be no more isotropic in the momentum space .",
    "we assume here an anisotropic gap function @xmath12 on the fermi surface by a physical consideration and solve the coupled schwinger - dyson equations self - consistently by way of the nambu formalism to find the axial - vector mean - field @xmath13 and the superconducting gap function @xmath12 .",

    "we , hereafter , take the static approximation for the gauge - boson propagator as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an effective gauge boson mass originated from the debye screening @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "since typical momentum transfer @xmath46 at high density is of the order of the chemical potential , we may further introduce the zero - range approximation @xcite for the propagator as @xmath47 with a typical momentum scale @xmath48 of @xmath49 .",
