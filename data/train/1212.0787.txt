    "it is widely believed that the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the laplacian @xmath3 or the hermite operator @xmath4 describes the physical phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "this belief is one of the main motivations for studying the cubic nls .",
    "bec is the phenomenon that particles of integer spin ( bosons ) occupy a macroscopic quantum state .",
    "this unusual state of matter was first predicted theoretically by einstein for non - interacting particles .",
    "the first experimental observation of bec in an interacting atomic gas did not occur until 1995 using laser cooling techniques @xcite .",
    "e. a. cornell , w. ketterle , and c. e. wieman were awarded the 2001 nobel prize in physics for observing bec .",
    "many similar successful experiments @xcite were performed later .",
    "let @xmath5 be the time variable and @xmath6 be the position vector of @xmath7 particles in @xmath8 .",
    "then bec naively means that the @xmath9-body wave function @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 up to a phase factor solely depending on @xmath12 , for some one particle state @xmath13 in other words , every particle is in the same quantum state .",
    "equivalently , there is the penrose - onsager formulation @xcite of bec : if we define @xmath14 to be the @xmath15-particle marginal densities associated with @xmath16 by @xmath17 then , equivalently , bec means @xmath18 gross @xcite and pitaevskii @xcite proposed that the many - body effect should be model by a strong on - site interaction and hence the one - particle state @xmath19 should be modeled by the a cubic nls . in a series of works @xcite , it has been proven rigorously that , under suitable assumptions on the interaction potential , relation holds in 3d and the one - particle state @xmath19 satisfies the 3d cubic nls .",
    "it is then natural to believe that the 2d cubic nls describes the 2d bec as well .",
    "however , there is no bec in 2d unless the temperature is absolute zero ( see p. 69 of @xcite and the references within ) . in other words ,",
    "2d bec is physically impossible due to the third law of thermodynamics . in a physically realistic setting ,",
    "2d nls can only arise from a 3d bec with strong confining in one direction ( which we take to be the @xmath20-direction ) .",
    "such an effective 3d@xmath21to 2d phenomenon has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a review . )",
    "it is then natural to consider the derivation of the 2d nls from a 3d @xmath9-body quantum dynamic .",
    "combining @xcite suggests a route of getting the 2d nls from 3d .",
    "first , a special case of theorem 2 in @xcite establishes the 3d cubic nls @xmath22from the 3d @xmath9-body quantum dynamic as a @xmath23 limit .",
    "then the result in @xcite shows that the 2d cubic nls arises from equation as a @xmath24 limit .",
    "this path corresponds to the iterated limit ( @xmath25 ) of the @xmath9-body dynamic , thus the 2d cubic nls coming from such a path approximates the 3d @xmath9-body dynamic when @xmath26 is large and @xmath9 is infinity . in experiments ,",
    "it is fully possible to have @xmath9 and @xmath26 comparable to each other .",
    "in fact , @xmath9 is about @xmath27 and @xmath26 is about @xmath28 in kettle3dto2dexperiment , frenchexperiment , natureexperiment , another2dexperiment . in this paper",
    ", we derive rigorously the 2d cubic nls as the double limit ( @xmath29 ) of a 3d quantum @xmath9-body dynamic directly , without passing through any 3d cubic nls .",
    "it is elementary mathematical analysis that @xmath30 and @xmath29 are topologically different and one does not imply each other . let us adopt the notation @xmath31and investigate the procedure of laboratory experiments of bec according to @xcite .    *",
    "step a*. confine a large number of bosons inside a trap with strong confining in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "cool it down so that the many - body system reaches its ground state .",
    "it is expected that this ground state is a bec state / factorized state . to formulate the problem mathematically",
    ", we use the quadratic potential @xmath32 to represent the trap and @xmath33 to represent the interaction potential .",
    "we use the quadratic potential to represent the trap because this simplified yet reasonably general model is expected to capture the salient features of the actual trap : on the one hand the quadratic potential varies slowly , on the other hand it tends to @xmath34 as @xmath35 . in the physics literature , lieb , seiringer and yngvason remarked in @xcite that the confining potential is typically @xmath36 in the available experiments .",
    "the review @xcite on @xcite also mentioned that the trap is harmonic .",
    "we use @xmath37 to represent the interaction potential to match the gross - pitaevskii description @xcite that the many - body effect should be modeled by an on - site self interaction because @xmath38 is an approximation of the identity as @xmath39 .",
    "this step then corresponds to the following mathematical problem :    [ problem : schnee - yngvason]show that , for large @xmath9 and large @xmath40 , the ground state of the @xmath9-body hamiltonian @xmath41 is a factorized state under proper assumptions on @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "* step b*. switch the trap in order to enable measurement or direct observation .",
    "it is assumed that such a shift of the confining potential is instant and does not destroy the bec obtained from step a. to be more precise about the word `` switch '' : in @xcite , the trap in the @xmath44-spatial directions are tuned very loose to generate a 2d bose gas .",
    "for mathematical convenience , we can assume @xmath45 becomes @xmath46 .",
    "the system is then time dependent .",
    "therefore , the factorized structure obtained in step a must be preserved in time for the observation of bec .",
    "mathematically , this step stands for the following problem .",
    "[ problem : ours]take the bec state obtained in step a as initial datum , show that , for large @xmath9 and @xmath47 the solution to the @xmath48body schrdinger equation @xmath49 is a bec state / factorized state under the same assumptions of the interaction potential @xmath43 in problem [ problem : schnee - yngvason ] .",
    "we first remark that neither of the problems listed above admits a factorized state solution .",
    "it is also unrealistic to solve the equations in problems [ problem : schnee - yngvason ] and [ problem : ours ] for large @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , both problems are linear so that it is not clear how the 2d cubic nls arises from either problem .",
    "therefore , in order to justify the statement that the 2d cubic nls depicts the 3d to 2d bec , we have to show mathematically that , in an appropriate sense , for some 3d one particle state @xmath19 fully described by the 2d cubic nls @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the @xmath15-marginal densities associated with @xmath52 .    for problem [ problem : schnee - yngvason ] ( step a ) , a satisfying answer has been found by schnee and yngvason .",

    "( see also @xcite for the case with rotation )    the gross - pitaevskii limit means @xmath67 .",

    "then @xmath71 this then implies that @xmath72 so that our assumption that the term @xmath73 dominates in the definition of @xmath66 is self - consistent .",
