    "the first experimental study of deuteron spin dichroism in carbon target was carried out at the electrostatic hvec tandem van - de - graaff accelerator with deuterons of up to 20  mev ( institut fr kernphysik of universitt zu kln ) @xcite , @xcite . according to experimental results appearance of tensor polarization in the transmitted deuterons beam",
    "was observed @xcite , @xcite . as a result spin dichroism of deuteron beam passing through unpolarized carbon target was discovered .",

    "let us discuss a possible magnitude of the deuteron birefringence effect . according to @xcite , @xcite birefringence effect depends on amplitudes of zero - angle elastic coherent scattering of a deuteron by a nucleus @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider theory of birefringence effect @xcite , @xcite briefly .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the deuteron hamiltonian ; @xmath9 the nuclear hamiltonian ; @xmath10 stands for the energy of deuteron - nucleus nuclear and coulomb interaction ; @xmath11 is the coordinate of the proton ( neutron ) entering into the deuteron @xmath12 is a set of coordinates of the nucleons . introducing the deuteron center - of - mass coordinate @xmath13 and the relative distance between the proton and neutron in the deuteron @xmath14 , we write ( [ ham1 ] ) as @xmath15 let us consider scattering of deuterons with energy above deuterons binding energy @xmath16 . for deuterons with energy 10 mev time of nuclear deuteron - carbon interaction is @xmath17 whereas the characteristic period of oscillation of nucleus in the deuteron is @xmath18 as a result we can apply the impulse approximation . in this approximation",
    "we can neglect of binding energy of nucleons in deuteron i. e. neglect of @xmath19 in ( [ ham2 ] ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath20    as is seen , in the impulse approximation the problem of determining the scattering amplitude reduces to the problem of scattering by a nucleus of a structureless particle of the deuteron mass . in this case",
    "the coordinate @xmath21 is a parameter .",
    "therefore , the relations obtained for the cross section and the forward scattering amplitude should be averaged over the parameter mentioned .",
    "for fast deuterons the scattering amplitude can be found in the eikonal approximation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of coherent zero - angle scattering can be written in this approximation as follows    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the deuteron wavenumber , @xmath24 is the impact parameter , @xmath25 is deuterons wave function . the phase shift due to the deuteron scattering by a carbon is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 component perpendicular to the momentum of incident deuteron",
    ", @xmath29 is the deuteron speed .    for the polarized deuteron under consideration",
    "the probability @xmath30 is differentiate for different spin states of deuteron .",

    "so that value of rotation can be measured experimentally on the installation described in @xcite , @xcite .    there are some reasons that can essentially increase birefringence effect .",

    "interaction of nucleon with carbon has a lot of resonances in energy region of carried out experiment .",
    "so experimental cross - section for some energy interval in 2 - 2.5 times more than estimated that can result in increasing of effects up to 4 - 6.25 times for that energy interval . at the second",
    ", parameter g is very sensitive to deuterons wave functions at small distances . at the third , the increasing of weight of d - state ( in @xcite it is 4.85% ) is increase birefringence effects .    according to fig.[fig1 ]",
    "coulomb scattering play very important role in birefringence value and behavior .",
    "position of peak , caused by coulomb interaction is sensitive to coulomb potential so it can be shifted for realistic interaction .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] give qualitative explanation of experimental results on fig.[fig4 ] @xcite , @xcite : sign of dichroism , strong dependence on energy , non - monotone and non - linear dependence of dichroism on target thickness .",
    "let s consider now another model of d - c interaction . at deuterons energy 10.5",
    "mev the characteristic time of coulomb deuteron - carbon interaction caused by radius of coulomb screening is @xmath84 i. e. much more then characteristic period of nucleons oscillation in deuteron @xmath85 ( @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are radiuses of coulomb screening and nucleus of carbon respectively ) .",
    "so in this case we ca nt to neglect by deuterons binding energy . due to high frequency of oscillation of nucleons in carbon and in deuteron for deuteron - carbon coulomb interaction we can use approximation for that in ( [ ham2 ] ) coulomb interaction is averaged by deuterons ground state wave functions .",
