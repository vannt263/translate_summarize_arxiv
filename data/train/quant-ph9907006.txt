    "<S> a physical random number generator based on the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanics is described . </S>",
    "<S> the random events are realized by the choice of single photons between the two outputs of a beamsplitter . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple device , which minimizes the impact of the photon counters noise , dead - time and after pulses .    16.0 cm -2.0 cm -2.0 cm    random numbers are employed today as well for numerical simulations as for cryptography </S>",
    "<S> . unfortunately computers are not able to generate true random numbers , as they are deterministic systems . </S>",
    "<S> numerical pseudo - random generators rely on complexity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although such pseudo - random numbers can generally be employed for numerical computation , such as monte - carlo simulations , their use in cryptography , for example to generate keys , is more critical . </S>",
    "<S> the only way to get true random numbers , hence true security for crypto - systems , is to build a generator based on a random physical phenomenon [ 2,3,4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as quantum theory is intrinsically random , a quantum process is an ideal base for a physical random number generator .    </S>",
    "<S> the randomness of a sequence of numbers can be extensively tested , though not proven . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus of interest to thoroughly understand the behavior of the random process , so as to gain confidence in its proper random operation . a statistical process , however , is generally hard to analyze because it involves a lot of variables </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , some quantum processes can be well described with only a few variables , like , for example , the random choice of a single photon between the two outputs of a beamsplitter [ 5,6,7 ] . in this paper , we present a simple , easy to use and potentially cheap random number generator based on this quantum process and on the technique of single photon counting . </S>",
    "<S> it fulfills the two major requirements for a physical random number generator : low correlations between successive outputs and stability to external perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> the principle of the generator is illustrated in the figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> weak pulses of a 830 nm led  are coupled into a monomode fibre . at the output of the 2 meter long monomode </S>",
    "<S> fibre all photons are in the same mode , therefore indistinguishable , irrespective of any thermal fluctuation of the led . </S>",
    "<S> they then impinge on two multimode fibres glued together some mm away from the monomode fiber . </S>",
    "<S> both multimode fibers are coupled to the same photon counter , one of the multimode fiber introducing a 60 ns delay . by detecting the time of arrival of the photon one can determine which path it took . labeling the short path by 0 and the long by 1 one </S>",
    "<S> obtain a sequence of random bits . </S>",
    "<S> the generation rate is of approximately 100khz , corresponding to 0.1 photon per pulse as the led is pulsed at 1mhz . </S>",
    "<S> note that a poissonnian photon number distribution with mean number 0.1 is a good approximation to the ideal single photon delta - distribution . a fpga circuit [ xilinx xc 3130 ] </S>",
    "<S> is used to pulse the led  and to detect the coincidences . </S>",
    "<S> it features three counters , one for the 0 bits , one for the 1 , defined by two 10 ns large time windows corresponding to the two different arrival times . </S>",
    "<S> the third counter measures the rate of thermal noise thanks to a time window outside the photon arrival times . </S>",
    "<S> the usb port interface to the computer offers sufficient speed , plug & play support and also the necessary power supply . </S>",
    "<S> the generator fits in a box of small size ( 68 x 150 x 188 mm ) .    as photon counter </S>",
    "<S> we use a passively quenched si - apd [ eg&g  c30902s ] in the geiger mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the limited efficiency of the detector is not an issue since the photons which are not detected do not influence the output of the generator . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal noise is not troublesome as it should be random , but our goal is to avoid such type of statistical random process . by using a 10 ns coincidence window the contribution of thermal counts </S>",
    "<S> is reduced below 0.5% even without cooling the detector . </S>",
    "<S> more critical are fast changes of the detector efficiency due to e.g. a ripple on the bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> recombining the two optical paths on one detector rather than two makes the generator much less sensitive to variabilities of the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , most of these variations will cancel since they affect in the same way the 0 and 1 events separated by only 60 ns . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have to take into account the fact that the detector is not in the same state after a detection as before . </S>",
    "<S> immediately after a detection the bias voltage goes below breakdown and the efficiency of the detector is zero ( dead - time ) . </S>",
    "<S> it then increases gradually and reaches its original value only after 1 @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for pulse frequencies @xmath1mhz a two detector scheme would reveal strong correlations , the probability to detect a 1 after a 0 being greater than the probability to detect a 0. in our one detector scheme this effect is mostly eliminated , but to a small correlation due to the difference in detection time of 60 ns . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation is limited to the first adjacent bit . </S>",
    "<S> it affects only 10%  of the bits , as we have adjacent detection only 10%  of the time . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation can be further reduced by decreasing the pulse rate or by electronically rejecting adjacent detections . we also have to consider the phenomenon of after - pulses : an increased probability of darkcounts immediately after a detection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after - pulses decrease with temperature and as we work at room temperature this effect is not significant .    </S>",
    "<S> the raw bits at the output of the generator are not equiprobable , because it is impossible to achieve a perfect 50/50 coupling between the two optical paths . </S>",
    "<S> but , in order to obtain a 50/50 distribution , one can unbias the bits by appropriate mathematical procedures . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest procedure is that of von neumann @xcite , but it s efficiency is limited to 25% . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , there are much more effective procedures , in particular that of y. peres @xcite which achieves the maximal efficiency given by the entropy per bit of the sequence . in our prototype </S>",
    "<S> the bits are approximately 40/60 distributed and the unbiasing procedure efficiency is greater than 90% .    in order to check the randomness of the output we applied the autocorrelation test , which measure the correlation between bits at a distance @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a sequence of @xmath5 bits . applying this test on @xmath6 raw bits with @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , we found no particular correlation apart from the case @xmath8 , which is 5@xmath9 bellow the mean . </S>",
    "<S> all the other points are normally distributed around the mean value . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between adjacent bits is very small , on the order of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be explained by the dead time of the detector , as discuss above . </S>",
    "<S> it disappears when an unbiasing procedure is applied . </S>",
    "<S> other tests , like frequency , serial and run [ 11,12 ] , entropy @xcite and maurer s [ 14,15 ] , did not reveal any deviation from a perfect random source .    in conclusion , we demonstrated a random number generator using a basic quantum process . </S>",
    "<S> apart from a small correlation between successive bits which is explained and can be eliminated , the generator behaves like a perfect random source . as the time delay between the detections corresponding to a 0 or to a 1 is very small , external perturbations hardly influence the output of the generator . </S>",
    "<S> the prototype is small , potentially cheap , easy to use @xcite and fast enough for cryptographic applications . </S>"
