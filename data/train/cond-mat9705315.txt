    "the spinless falicov - kimball model has two types of particles : spinless electrons and classical particles , which we refer to as ions .",
    "the particles are on a lattice with the restriction that there is at most one ion at each lattice site .",
    "the spinless electrons are fermions , so there is at most one electron per site .",
    "the electrons can hop between nearest neighbor sites , but the ions can not .",
    "there is an on - site interaction between electrons and ions .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are creation and annihilation operators for the electrons .",
    "@xmath8 is the occupation number for the ions , i.e. , @xmath9 if there is a ion at @xmath10 and @xmath11 if there is not .",
    "the sum over @xmath12 is over nearest neighbor bonds in the lattice .",
    "( the factor of 4 in front of the @xmath13 is included for latter convenience . )",
    "this paper is only concerned with the square lattice , although the model may be defined on any lattice .",
    "we will only consider the neutral model in which the number of electrons is equal to the number of ions , and the interaction parameter @xmath13 will be large and positive . by a hole - particle transformation results for positive @xmath13",
    "imply results for negative @xmath13 , but we will not bother to state them .    a review of rigorous work on the falicov - kimball model may be found in @xcite . here",
    "we mention only some of the work on the neutral model for large positive @xmath13 .",
    "in one dimension it is expected that for large @xmath13 the ground state of the neutral model with rational density is the periodic arrangement of the ions which is `` most homogeneous . ''",
    "( there is an explicit algorithm for determining the most homogeneous configuration . )",
    "this was proved by lemberger for @xmath14 where @xmath15 depends on the denominator of the rational density @xcite . in any number of dimensions the ground state for density",
    "@xmath16 is the checkerboard configuration for all @xmath17 @xcite . in two dimensions with large @xmath13",
    "the ground states for densities @xmath18 and @xmath1 are known rigorously and are periodic @xcite . for densities between @xmath0 and @xmath16",
    "there are partial results on the ground state @xcite , but there is no proof it is periodic for rational densities .",
    "based on what is known in one and two dimensions and the methods used to obtain these results , it is natural to conjecture that in two dimensions the ground state for large @xmath13 is periodic for rational densities .    in this paper",
    "we prove that this conjecture is wrong for densities between @xmath1 and @xmath0 other than @xmath2 .",
    "in this density range there is phase separation in the ground state .",
    "the phases involved are the ground states for densities @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 , which are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the ground state for densities between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is made up of large regions of density @xmath1 and density @xmath2 ground states with the relative areas chosen to yield the desired density .",
    "a similar statement holds for densities between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the precise theorem is as follows .",
    "1    [ thmmain ] there are positive constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that for @xmath21 the following is true for @xmath22 by @xmath22 squares @xmath23 with @xmath24 ions and @xmath24 electrons .",
    "let @xmath25 be the common density .",
    "if the density @xmath26 is @xmath2 , @xmath22 is a multiple of 6 and we use periodic boundary conditions , then the ground state configurations of the ions are configuration b in figure 1 and its translates .",
    "if the density @xmath26 is between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then for every ground state configuration of the ions we can find a subset @xmath27 of @xmath23 which contains at most @xmath28 sites and is such that on each connected component of @xmath29 the configuration agrees with either configuration a or b in figure 1 ( up to a lattice symmetry ) . if the density @xmath26 is between @xmath2 and @xmath0 , then the same statement is true with `` a or b '' replaced by `` b or d. '' ( the statements for densities other than @xmath2 are true for any choice of boundary conditions . )    although @xmath30 is large , the key point is that the bound on the number of sites in @xmath27 contains @xmath22 while the number of sites in @xmath23 is @xmath31 .",
    "so for large @xmath22 , @xmath27 is a tiny fraction of the total area .",
    "we can think of @xmath27 as consisting of domain walls between large regions which contain one of the configurations shown in figure @xmath32 .",
    "the phase separation we find in this range of densities for the neutral model should not be confused with the phase separation discussed by freericks and falicov @xcite .",
    "their argument applied to the non - neutral model .",
    "the expectation that the neutral model with rational density should have periodic ground states is based on the following intuition .",
    "the attraction between electrons and ions is large , so each electron spends most of its time at a site with an ion .",
    "now consider the kinetic energy of an electron .",
    "if nearby sites have ions , then the electrons at those sites will restrict the movement of the electron we are considering .",
    "so its kinetic energy is minimized by spreading out the ions as much as possible to maximize the space that each electron has to move in .",
    "however , watson @xcite emphasized that there will typically be a mismatch between the lattice and the natural ion configuration in the absence of a lattice .",
    "thus the lattice structure can frustrate the exclusion principle s attempts to put the ions in the `` most homogeneous '' configuration .",
    "we should emphasize that this paper only covers a small interval of densities .",
    "an important open question is whether the phase separation we find here holds for most densities , or whether there are intervals in which the rational densities have periodic ground states which are the most homogeneous in some sense .",
    "we conclude the introduction by sketching the proof for densities in @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath13 is large and the model is neutral , the ground state energy of a given ion configuration may be expanded in powers of @xmath33 .",
    "this yields an effective hamiltonian for the ions .",
    "one can begin to study it by only keeping terms up to a certain order in @xmath33 .",
    "( of course , to prove anything one must eventually consider all orders . )",
    "watson @xcite showed that when the density is between @xmath1 and @xmath0 the ground states of the fourth order hamiltonian correspond to tilings of the plane by squares and diamonds in which the squares and diamonds have the dimensions of those found in figure 1 .",
    "watson s result will play a crucial role in our proof .",
    "the vertices in such a tiling can be one of four types which we label a , b , c or d following watson s notation .",
    "the four types are shown in figure 3 .",
    "note that in figure 1 configurations a , b or d contain only vertices of type a , b or d , respectively .",
    "all configurations that correspond to a square - diamond tiling have the same energy through fourth order .",
    "to determine the ground states for densities in @xmath3 we must go to higher orders in the perturbation series . following watson s treatment of a similar model , we write the hamiltonian as a function of the number of each type of vertex . at sixth order",
    "these square - diamond tilings still all have the same energy . at eighth order vertices of type a ,",
    "b and c have the same energy but vertices of type d have higher energy . for densities between @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "there are square - diamond tilings which contain no vertices of type d. to determine the ground state among all these configurations we must go to tenth order . here",
    "we find that the energy of a type c vertex is higher than that of a type b vertex .",
    "thus for densities in @xmath3 the ground state must be a square - diamond tiling with only type a and b vertices .",
    "( note that the tiling with only type a vertices has density 1/5 , while the tiling with only type b vertices has density 2/9 .",
    "so one can obtain any density in @xmath3 by a suitable mix of type a and b vertices . )",
    "however , a type a vertex can not be adjacent to a type b vertex . thus we must separate the a and b vertices to minimize the energy .",
    "to derive the perturbation theory it is convenient to change to `` spin '' variables for the ions .",
    "let @xmath34 , so @xmath35 when there is an ion at @xmath10 and @xmath36 when there is not .",
    "we then take @xmath37 this differs from the original hamiltonian by a term proportional to @xmath38 , but we will only consider problems in which the number of electrons is fixed , so such a term is constant .",
    "there are no interactions between the electrons , so the hamiltonian is just the second quantized form of the single electron hamiltonian @xmath39 . the operator @xmath40 has matrix elements @xmath41 with @xmath42 if @xmath43 and @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "the operator @xmath45 is diagonal with entries @xmath46 .",
    "the ground state energy for @xmath47 electrons is the sum of the @xmath47 lowest eigenvalues of @xmath48 . to find the ground state for a particular density of electrons and ions we must minimize this energy over all @xmath45 with the desired ion density .",
    "let @xmath49 be the ground state energy for the ion configuration @xmath45 with the number of electrons equal to the number of ions .",
    "to expand @xmath49 in powers of @xmath33 , we begin by rewriting @xmath49 as in @xcite . if @xmath50 then the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath48 is equal to the number of sites with @xmath51 , i.e. , the number of ions .",
    "thus when the number of electrons equals the number of ions , we have @xmath52\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are the eigenvalues of @xmath48 .",
    "now @xmath54 , and if we keep the number of ions fixed then @xmath55 is a constant .",
    "so we might as well redefine @xmath56 .",
    "then we write this as @xmath57^{{1 \\over 2 } } )   = -u tr(1+\\delta)^{{1 \\over 2}}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 we have used the fact that @xmath59 .",
    "now we derive the perturbation theory by following the treatment by gruber , jedrzejewski and lemberger @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different derivation may be found in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath13 is sufficiently large , then @xmath60 and we may expand @xmath61 in a power series in @xmath62 . since @xmath41 is nonzero only if @xmath10 and @xmath63 are nearest neighbors , when we take the trace of each term we generate nearest neighbor walks that end where they start .",
    "grouping together terms with the same power of @xmath64 , we may write the result as @xmath65 @xmath66 is summed over finite subsets of the lattice , and @xmath67 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath68 is nonzero only if there is a nearest neighbor walk with @xmath69 steps which ends where it begins and visits each site in @xmath66 .",
    "( it may visit sites outside of @xmath66 as well . )",
    "the coefficients @xmath68 are invariant under the usual lattice symmetries .",
    "there is a constant @xmath20 such that for every site @xmath10",
    "@xmath70    we need to compute this effective hamiltonian through tenth order , i.e. , through the @xmath71 terms .",
    "there are a lot of terms at this order .",
    "since we will consider relatively low densities , it will prove useful to go back to the occupation variables @xmath8 .",
    "( recall that @xmath72 . )",
    "equation ( [ eqa ] ) gives @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",

    "the @xmath75 satisfy a bound like ( [ eqb ] ) .    for the proof it is useful to split the effective hamiltonian into three parts .",

    "there are only a few such sets and we can compute their coefficients explicitly , but as we will see their actual values play no role in the proof . if @xmath88 and @xmath89 , then there is a nearest neighbor pair @xmath87 with @xmath90 .",
    "this gives a contribution of @xmath91 to @xmath77 which is much larger than the order @xmath92 contribution from @xmath93 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for configurations with density between @xmath1 and @xmath0 which minimize @xmath77 every 3 by 3 block of sites must look like one of the four configurations shown in figure 2 .",

    "= 20 pt = 20 pt figure 2 : for densities between 1/5 and 1/4 , fourth order perturbation theory implies that in a ground state every 3 by 3 square must be one of the above cases , up to lattice symmetries .",
    "[ lema ] if every 3 by 3 block equals one of those shown in figure 2 ( up to a lattice symmetry ) , then the configuration corresponds to a tiling of the lattice by squares and diamonds in which every vertex looks like one of the four types shown in figure 3 up to a lattice symmetry .",
    "* proof @xcite : * note that the 3 by 3 blocks we are using can overlap .",
    "thus the condition that every one of these blocks is one of those shown in figure 2 puts many constraints on the configuration .",
    "we start with a site at which there is an ion . using the fact that every 3 by 3 block is one of those shown in figure 2 we work outwards from the initial ion and determine all possible configurations in the neighborhood of the inital ion .",
    "we find that the configuration must look like one of the four cases shown in figure 3 .",
    "width5pt    it is important to note that the proof of the lemma is local .",
    "if we have a configuration in which some 3 by 3 blocks are not one of those shown in figure 2 , then we can still conclude that in the parts of the lattice where the 3 by 3 blocks are one of those shown in the figure the configuration must be given by a square - diamond tiling .",
    "we will say that an ion is type a , b , c or d if the configuration in the neighborhood of the ion agrees with that shown in figure 3 up to a lattice symmetry .",
    "note that in regions where the configuration does not correspond to a square - diamond tiling there will be ions that are not any of these four types .",
    "the tenth order hamiltonian @xmath80 contains too many terms to list here .",

    "two ions can not be separated by a distance @xmath94 , @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",

    "each ion corresponds to a vertex in the square - diamond tiling , so @xmath139 by considering the areas associated with each of the four types of vertices in figure 3 , we see that @xmath140 using these two equations we can eliminate @xmath141 and @xmath142 from our expression for @xmath80 .",
