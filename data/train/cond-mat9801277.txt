    "after applying their version of thermodynamic perturbation theory to square - well and lennard - jones fluids , john barker and doug henderson characterized it as a `` successful theory of liquids ''  @xcite .",
    "and so it was . when tested against simulation results it proved to be impressively accurate at liquid - state densities and temperatures , unlike some versions of thermodynamic perturbation theory that had preceded it .",
    "and it bypassed the troubling lack of thermodynamic self - consistency associated with the direct use of the radial distribution functions obtained from the integral - equation theories then available , as well as yielding thermodynamic results as good or better than the best results obtainable from such integral equations .",
    "these positive features became hallmarks of successful thermodynamic perturbation theories for simple fluids and were shared by the versions  @xcite that followed the barker and henderson work as well as an alternative perturbative approach set forth somewhat earlier by hauge and hemmer  @xcite that was based on using the inverse range of the attractive interaction rather than its strength as a perturbation parameter .",
    "integral - equation approaches with improved self - consistency were also developed subsequently to yield accurate liquid - state thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the accuracy of all these approaches begins to decrease substantially as one leaves the liquid - state region located slightly above the triple point in temperature and follows the liquid - gas coexistence curve in the density  temperature plane up to the critical region . in particular , the shape of the coexistence curve and location of the critical point are not accurately reproduced , nor are related critical parameters . in the case of the perturbation theories ,",
    "it is not hard to understand why this is so . all of them are mean - field - like in nature , associated with coexistence curves that are quadratic close to the critical point , whereas the true coexistence curve is very nearly cubic .",
    "that is , in these theories one finds near the critical point a coexistence curve of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the critical values of number density @xmath8 and absolute temperature @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a constant .",
    "in contrast , in an exact treatment , one would expect to find @xmath11 close to @xmath12 . in these theories",
    "the resulting @xmath7 is usually more than 5% too high and the critical compressibility factor @xmath13 is usually more than 10% too high . here",
    "@xmath14 is the pressure , and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the thermodynamics associated with the radial distribution function @xmath1 obtained form various integral - equation approaches can not be so neatly categorized . however , in the cases in which there are substantial discrepancies between the several paths available for obtaining thermodynamics from @xmath1 , the most reliable and accurate coexistence behavior is often obtained from evaluating the thermodynamics through the excess internal energy expressed in terms of an integral over the pair potential @xmath16 weighted by @xmath1 . for continuum - fluid models",
    "the resulting critical behavior is typically mean - field like in the cases that we have studied , and thus subject to the same deficiencies as one approaches the critical region . in some integral - equation approaches that have been developed in order to insure a certain degree of thermodynamic consistency",
    ", the description of the critical region and of the phase diagram appears to be more problematic : for instance , the modified hypernetted chain ( mhnc ) theory  @xcite is indeed able to predict quite satisfactorily the liquid and the vapor branches of the coexistence curve of a simple fluid at low enough temperature , but it fails to converge close to the critical point , so that the two branches remain unconnected , and the position of the critical point is not given directly by the theory , but must be determined by extrapolation  @xcite .",
    "the same kind of behavior  @xcite is found also for the hmsa integral equation [ the acronym coming from the fact that the theory  @xcite interpolates between the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) and the soft mean spherical approximation ( smsa ) ] .",
    "the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza ) we consider here is not mean - field - like , and it remains highly accurate as one goes from liquid - state conditions to critical - point conditions .",
    "in particular the power @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ coex ] ) was recently shown analytically to be given in the scoza by exactly @xmath17  @xcite . and",
    "as we discuss in this paper , in the hard - core yukawa fluid ( hcyf ) @xmath7 appears to be within 0.6% of its value as estimated by our simulation results .",
    "( similarly , in recent three - dimensional lattice - gas studies  @xcite the scoza @xmath7 was found to be within 0.2% of its estimated exact value ) .",
    "as described elsewhere  @xcite the scaling behavior of the scoza thermodynamics is somewhat different from the simple scaling one expects to see in the exact thermodynamics , although those differences only begin to appear clearly when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are within less than 1% of their critical values .",
    "closer to the critical point , the effective exponents defined above @xmath7 approach spherical - model values as the critical point is approached , whereas the exponents defined below @xmath7 do not .",
    "the exponents are discussed in sec .",
    "the scoza was proposed some time ago by hye and stell  @xcite but fast and accurate algorithms for evaluating its thermodynamic predictions were developed only recently  @xcite .",
    "a sharp assessment of its accuracy for the hcyf could not be made on the basis of existing simulations , and for that reason our study here includes new monte carlo ( mc ) results exploiting finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the hcyf pair potential as the first of the continuum - fluid potentials to be considered in our studies of the scoza for several reasons .",
    "first , it embodies the two key features one requires in an off - lattice pair potential in order to consider both the liquid state and liquid - gas criticality  a highly repulsive core and an attractive well .",
    "second , the hcyf proves to be particularly convenient to analyze using the scoza ( the square - well fluid is far less convenient in this regard ) .",
    "third , the functional form of the hard - core yukawa potential makes it appropriate as a generic solvent - averaged interaction potential between polyelectrolytes and colloids as well as a generic simple - fluid pair potential .",
    "for this reason it seems particularly useful to have an accurate theory for both the structure and thermodynamics of the hcyf , which has already been the subject of a number of previous studies .",
    "we shall make contact with several of those here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 we describe the theory and present some details of the method for the system under study , in sec .",
    "3 our results are shown and a comparison with other theories and simulation results is made , and in sec .",
    "4 our conclusions are drawn .",
    "the treatment of the hard - sphere gas and the main features of the mc - fss simulation method are summarized respectively in appendix  a and appendix  b.",
    "here we consider a fluid of spherical particles interacting via a two - body potential @xmath18 which is the sum of a singular repulsive hard - sphere contribution and an attractive tail @xmath19 .",
    "the expression for @xmath18 is then @xmath20 where the hard - sphere diameter has been set equal equal to unity .",
    "as is customary in integral equation theories of fluids , the present approach introduces an approximate closure relation for the direct correlation function @xmath21 which , once supplemented with the exact ornstein - zernike equation involving @xmath21 and the radial distribution function @xmath1 , yields a closed theory for the thermodynamics and the correlations of the system under study .",
    "the basic requirement we want to incorporate in the scoza is the consistency between the compressibility and internal energy route to the thermodynamics . according to the compressibility route ,",
    "the thermodynamics stems from the reduced compressibility @xmath22 as determined by the sum rule @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fourier transform of the direct correlation function and @xmath25 is the number density of the system . in the internal energy route",
    "the key to the thermodynamics is instead provided by the excess internal energy as given by the integral of the interaction weighted by the radial distribution function : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the excess internal energy per unit volume and we have taken into account that @xmath1 vanishes for @xmath3 due to the hard - core repulsion .",
    "in the following we will refer to the `` excess internal energy '' simply as the `` internal energy '' . if @xmath22 and @xmath27 come from a unique helmholtz free energy it is straightforward to find that one must have @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath9 being the absolute temperature , and @xmath30 the boltzmann constant .",
    "while this relation is of course satisfied by the exact compressibility and internal energy , this is not the case with those predicted by most integral equation theories . in order to cope with this lack of thermodynamic consistency",
    ", we consider the following closure to the ornstein - zernike equation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the direct correlation function of the hard - sphere fluid , and @xmath33 is a function of the thermodynamic state of the system . in eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) the approximation clearly lies in the simple form of @xmath21 outside the repulsive core .",
    "the closure above resembles the one used in the approximation known as both the lowest - order gamma - ordered approximation ( loga )  @xcite and the optimized random phase approximation ( orpa )  @xcite .",
    "however , while in the loga / orpa one has @xmath34 , in eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) @xmath33 is not fixed _ a priori _ , but instead must be determined so that the thermodynamic consistency condition  ( [ consist ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this gives rise to a partial differential equation ( pde ) for the function @xmath35 , provided an expression for the hard - sphere direct correlation function @xmath32 is given .",
    "the most popular parameterization for @xmath32 in the fluid region is due to verlet and weis  @xcite .",
    "another choice that yields the same thermodynamics as verlet - weis , and that we find convenient in view of the calculations performed in this work , is originally due to waisman  @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently extended analytically by hye and stell  @xcite and explored in some detail by henderson and coworkers  @xcite .",

    ", we found that the two simulations for the phase diagram of the system under study already reported in the literature  @xcite do not agree very well with each other .",
    "we then performed a new set of simulations using the mc - fss method summarized in appendix  b. the scoza and the simulation results for the critical point are compared in tab .  4 , which also shows the predictions of other theories  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the agreement between the scoza and the present simulation is remarkably good : the error in the critical density and temperature is respectively slightly more and slightly less than 0.6% .",
    "the scoza and the simulation coexistence curve in the temperature  density plane are compared in fig .  2 . a similar comparison in the temperature  internal energy and in the temperature  chemical potential plane is shown respectively in fig .  3 and in fig  4 .",
    "in every case the scoza agrees very well with the simulation .",
    "it can be also appreciated that in the scoza the coexistence curve extends up to the critical point , while , as already observed in the introduction , this is not always the case with other theories . in tab .  4 and in figs .",
    "24 we have also reported the predictions of the simpler version of the scoza mentioned in sec .  2 , in which the direct correlation function outside the repulsive core is given by just one yukawa tail , and the thermodynamics of the hard - sphere gas is described in the py approximation .",
    "it can be observed that even for not very short - ranged interaction the treatment of the repulsive contribution considerably affects the phase diagram predicted by the theory , the two - yukawa scoza sensibly improving over the one - yukawa version .",
    "the behavior of the scoza in the critical region has been studied both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite .",
    "this investigation has shown that above the critical temperature the scoza yields the same critical exponents as the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) , i.e. @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , where the usual notation for the critical exponents has been used .",
    "on the other hand , on the coexistence curve the critical exponents are neither spherical nor classical , and one finds @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 ( here of course @xmath101 is the critical exponent that gives the curvature of the coexistence curve near the critical point ) .",
    "although these results were determined in the case of a nearest - neighbor attractive lattice gas , we expect them to hold also in the continuum case .",
    "5 shows the reduced compressibility of the hcyf for @xmath159 and @xmath160 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath161 on a log - log plot .",
    "also shown is the correspondent _ effective exponent _ @xmath162 , defined as the local slope of the plot . it can be seen that @xmath162 eventually saturates at @xmath153 , thus signaling the onset of a msa - like power - law behavior , but the asymptotic regime can be detected only at very small reduced temperature ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "this is the same scenario previously found in the nearest - neighbor lattice gas . for the hcyf ,",
    "the crossover is controlled as expected by the inverse range parameter @xmath40 .",
    "it has been verified that as the interaction becomes longer and longer ranged , the asymptotic regime is further pushed to smaller and smaller values of the reduced temperature @xmath164  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamics and the phase diagram of the hcyf using both the scoza and mc simulations supplemented by a finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "the comparison between theory and simulation results shows that the scoza yields both very good overall thermodynamics and a remarkably accurate coexistence curve up to the critical point .",
    "the version of the scoza considered here takes into account the hard - sphere contribution to the direct correlation function outside the repulsive core , and sensibly improves over the simpler one - yukawa version , in which the hard - sphere gas is described as in the py approximation . on the other hand , as stated in sec .",
    "2 , here ( as well as in the simpler version just mentioned ) consistency has been enforced between the internal energy and the compressibility route , but not between the virial route and either of the above .",
    "we think that the further development of making the theory fully self - consistent by taking also the virial route into account is worth pursuing , since we anticipate that the present version of the scoza will yield liquid - state pressures from the virial theorem that are not significantly better than those obtained using the virial theorem with the loga / orpa @xmath1 .",
    "we defer a detailed examination of this issue to a later study . in this respect",
    "it is worth mentioning an investigation of the hcyf along the lines considered here  @xcite , where some results for the critical parameters were reported taking into account all the three routes to the thermodynamics although , as explicitly pointed out by the authors , the scoza equations were studied in an approximate fashion , and no attempt to determine the phase diagram was made .",
    "although dealing with a yukawa potential entails certain analytical simplifications in implementing the scoza , such an approach can be applied to any kind of tail potential .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the idea of using the requirement of self - consistency to get a closed theory of thermodynamics and correlations is pertinent not only to the realm of simple fluids or lattice gases , but has also proven to be a powerful tool in the study of a system of spins with continuous symmetry  @xcite , and of a site - diluted  @xcite or random - field  @xcite ising model .",
