    "inspired by the success of iterative decoding of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes , originally introduced by gallager @xcite and later rediscovered in the mid 1990 s by mackay and neal @xcite , on a wide variety of communication channels , the idea of iterative , soft - decision decoding has recently been applied to classical algebraically constructed codes in order to achieve low - complexity belief propagation decoding @xcite .",
    "also , the classical idea of using the automorphism group of the code , @xmath0 , to permute the code , @xmath1 , during decoding ( known as _ permutation decoding _ ( pd ) @xcite ) has been successfully modified to enhance the sum - product algorithm ( spa ) in @xcite .",
    "we will denote this algorithm by spa - pd .",
    "furthermore , good results have been achieved by running such algorithms on several structurally distinct representations of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "both reed - solomon and bose - chaudhuri - hocquenghem ( bch ) codes have been considered in this context .",
    "certain algebraically constructed codes are known to exhibit large minimum distance and a non - trivial @xmath0 .",
    "however , additional properties come into play in modern , graph - based coding theory , for instance , sparsity , girth , and trapping sets @xcite",
    ". structural weaknesses of graphical codes are inherent to the particular parity - check matrix , @xmath2 , used to implement @xmath1 in the decoder .",
    "this matrix is a non - unique @xmath3-dimensional basis for the null space of @xmath1 , which , in turn , is a @xmath4-dimensional subspace of @xmath5 .",
    "although any basis ( for the dual code , @xmath6 ) is a parity - check matrix for @xmath1 , their performance in decoders is not uniform .",
    "@xmath2 is said to be in standard form if the matrix has @xmath7 weight-1 columns .",
    "the weight of @xmath2 is the number of non - zero entries , and the minimum weight is lower - bounded by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the minimum distance of @xmath6 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath2 can be mapped into a bipartite ( tanner ) graph , @xmath10 , which has an edge connecting nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 _ iff _ @xmath13 . here ,",
    "@xmath14 , refers to the bit nodes ( columns of @xmath2 ) , and @xmath15 , refers to the check nodes ( rows of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the local neighborhood of a node , @xmath16 , is the set of nodes adjacent to @xmath16 , and is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the terms standard form and weight extend trivially to @xmath10 . in the following , we use bold face notation for vectors , and the transpose of @xmath2",
    "is written @xmath18 .",
    "this paper is a continuation of our previous work on edge local complementation ( elc ) and iterative decoding , in which selective use of elc ( with preprocessing and memory overhead ) equals spa - pd @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use elc in a truly random , online fashion , thus simplifying both the description and application of the proposed decoder .",
    "the key difference from our previous work is that we do not take measures to preserve graph isomorphism , and explore the benefits of going outside the automorphism group of the code .",
    "this means that we alleviate the preprocessing of suitable elc locations ( edges ) , as well as the memory overhead of storing and sampling from such a set during decoding .",
    "our proposed decoding algorithm can be thought of as a combination of spa - pd @xcite and multiple bases belief propagation @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the modification of the powerful technique of damping to a graph - local perspective .",
    "the operation of elc @xcite , also known as pivot , is a local operation on a simple graph ( undirected with no loops ) , @xmath19 , which has been shown to be useful both for code equivalence and classification @xcite , and for decoding purposes @xcite .",

    "the spa is an inherently local algorithm on @xmath10 , where the global problem of decoding is partitioned into a system of simpler subproblems @xcite .",
    "each node and its adjacent edges can be considered as a small constituent code , and essentially performs maximum - likelihood decoding ( mld ) based on local information .",
    "the key to a successful decoder lies in this partitioning  how these constituent codes are interconnected .",

    "subtracting the input from the app leaves the extrinsic information , @xmath43 , which is produced by the decoder .",
    "the message on the edge from node @xmath16 to @xmath27 , in the direction of @xmath27 , @xmath44 , is computed according to the spa rule on node @xmath16 .",
    "the spa computation of all check nodes , followed by all bit nodes , is referred to as one _ flooding _ iteration .",
    "classical codes , for which strong code properties are known , are typically not very suitable for iterative decoding mainly due to the high weight of their parity - check matrices , which gives many short cycles in the corresponding tanner graphs .",
    "a few recent proposals in the literature have attempted to enhance iterative decoding by dynamically modifying @xmath10 during decoding , so as to achieve diversity and avoid fixed points ( local optima ) in the spa convergence process .",
    "efforts to improve decoding may , roughly , be divided into two categories .",
    "the first approach is to employ several structurally distinct matrices , and use these in a parallel , or sequential , fashion @xcite",
    ". these matrices may be either preprocessed , or found dynamically by changing the graph during decoding .",
    "however , this incurs an overhead either in terms of memory ( keeping a list of matrices , as well as state data ) , or complexity ( adapting the matrix , e.g. , by gaussian elimination @xcite ) . the other approach is to choose a code with a non - trivial @xmath0 , such that diversity may be achieved by permuting the code coordinates @xcite .    //",

    "currently , the spa stopping criterion ( i.e. , the parameters used to flag when decoding should stop ) is still implemented globally . however",
    ", a reasonable local solution would be to remove the syndrome check ( @xmath55 ) from the stopping criterion , and simply stop after @xmath76 spa - elc iterations , where @xmath76 can be empirically determined . however , this has obvious implications for complexity and latency . in some scenarios",

    "for the extended golay code and the eqr48 code , we set a maximum at @xmath83 iterations , which we increased to @xmath84 to accommodate the larger eqr104 code .",
    "for spa - elc we have also included results without damping . since spa - elc changes the weight of @xmath10 , we can not compare complexity by simply counting iterations .",
    "since the complexity of one elc operation is much smaller than the complexity of a spa iteration , the total number of spa messages may serve as a common measure for the complexity of the decoders .",
    "we have no initial syndrome check , so the number of iterations approaches @xmath85 at high @xmath82 .",
    "in the same way , the complexity approaches the average weight of the matrices encountered during decoding .",
    "each fer point was simulated until at least @xmath86 frame errors were observed .    from the figures , we observe that the spa - elc decoder outperforms standard spa decoding , both in terms of fer and decoding complexity .",
    "the extended golay code is a perfect example for demonstrating the benefits of spa - elc .",
    "the s - orbit of this code contains only two structures , where one is of minimum weight ( weight @xmath87 ) and the other only slightly more dense ( weight @xmath88 ) , while the iso - orbit of the code is very large .",
    "thus , we can extend spa - pd with multiple tanner graphs ( two structures ) while keeping the density low .",
    "not surprisingly , spa - elc achieves the fer performance of spa - pd , albeit with some complexity penalty .",
    "note that the simple spa - elc decoder , without damping , approaches closely the complexity of spa - pd at the cost of a slight loss in fer .",
    "for the larger codes , the sizes of the s - orbits are very large , and many structures are less suited for spa - pd",
    ". still , the same tradeoff between fer performance and complexity holds , based on whether or not we use damping . for the eqr48 code , we have observed a rich subset of the s - orbit containing minimum weight structures ( weight @xmath89 ) . the optimum value of @xmath90 ( see line  10 in algorithm  [ spaelc ] ) was determined empirically .",
    "we have described a local diversity decoder , based on the spa and the elc operation .",
    "the spa - elc algorithm outperforms the standard spa both in terms of error rate performance and complexity , and compares well against spa - pd , despite the fact that spa - pd uses global operations .",
    "ongoing efforts are devoted to further improvements , and include ; selective application of elc , rather than random ; devise techniques such that diversity may be restricted to sparse structures in the s - orbit ; identify a code construction suited to spa - elc , for which the s - orbit contains several desirable structures even for large blocklengths .",
