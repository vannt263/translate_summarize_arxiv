    "the efficiency of these reaction processes , collectively referred to as `` metabolism '' , is an important factor for the fitness of a cell . given that intracellular reactions are catalysed by enzymes , the efficiency of such reactions also depends on the enzyme concentrations and their dynamics . therefore , as cells regulate enzyme concentrations through protein expression dynamics , the potential relationship between metabolic efficiency and enzyme dynamics is an important issue warranting investigation @xcite .",

    "hence , investigations of the thermodynamic nature of dynamic metabolic processes are not only important to resolve basic questions in cellular biophysics but can also provide insight for non - equilibrium physics .",
    "+  metabolic processes can be generally classified into anabolism and catabolism .",
    "the former is a synthesis process of biomolecules from nutrients , which typically involves consumption of energy by transforming atp to adp , whereas the latter involves decomposition of nutrients into smaller molecules , and consequently releases energy with a change from adp to atp . through this metabolism ,",
    "chemical resources are transformed into products along with the energy transduction between atp and adp .",
    "the thermodynamic efficiency of such energy transduction processes has been extensively studied @xcite .",

    "+  in contrast , there are a variety of time - dependent ( non - steady ) processes in cellular metabolism , such as those observed in the cell cycle @xcite , cyclic amp signaling @xcite , circadian rhythms @xcite glycolytic oscillation @xcite , and yeast metabolic cycle ( ymc ) @xcite .",
    "the enzyme concentrations change in time during these dynamic processes , which then alters the time scale of the reaction processes , as mentioned above .",
    "thus , it is important to study the characteristics of such `` dynamic '' processes of cellular metabolism , and uncover the potential influence of the cyclic process on the thermodynamic efficiency of the metabolic processes .",
    "+  toward this end , we here introduce a simple model of coupled anabolic and catabolic reactions , each of which is catalysed by a corresponding enzyme and uses typical energy currency molecules ( atp and adp ) .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that temporal changes in enzyme concentrations are required to achieve higher thermodynamic efficiency under the condition in which available enzymes are limited .",
    "+  in section 2 , the nutrient , waste , substrate , product ( nwsp ) model is described and implemented by applying periodic oscillations of the abundances of enzymes for anabolism and catabolism .",
    "this model showed improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to the steady - state condition .",

    "the oscillation in enzyme abundances is in strong contrast with the general condition of a decrease in thermodynamic efficiency due to oscillatory inputs . in section 3 , we discuss the biological relevance of these results for the dynamic control of enzyme abundances .",
    "here , we introduce a simple model for a metabolic process consisting of anabolism and catabolism , by extending the model introduced by westerhoff et al.@xcite . in the westerhoff model ,",
    "anabolism ( process for the synthesis of biomolecules ) and catabolism ( process for the digestion of nutrients ) are analysed using linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics , in which the deviation from chemical equilibrium is assumed to be small , and the steady chemical reaction flow and thermodynamic force ( affinity ) are proportional @xcite . to incorporate oscillatory dynamics , we extended this model so that the chemical concentrations change according to the rate equation of the chemical reactions . specifically , our model consists of four chemical species , i.e. , nutrient , waste , substrate , and product , in addition to the energy currency molecules atp and adp , and involves two catalytic enzymes for anabolism and catabolism , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the catabolic reaction decomposes nutrients to waste with the aid of the catalyst @xmath3 , simultaneously transforming adp into atp , whereas the anabolism reaction synthesizes a product from a substrate with the aid of @xmath2 , by consuming energy with the change from atp to adp . as a consequence of the coupled reactions of catabolism and anabolism , the product is synthesised from a substrate by consuming a nutrient .",
    "if the enzyme concentrations are constant , there is a steady flow generated from nutrient and substrate to waste and product , depending on the concentrations of the chemical spoecies , as in the westerhoff model . here , we introduce a periodic change in the concentration of each enzyme , and study the effect of this temporal change in enzyme concentrations on the thermodynamic efficiency of this metabolism .",
    "thus , to reflect all of these reaction dynamics , our model is given by @xmath4}{{\\rm d } t}&=&-j_c+\\bigl([\\rm{nutrient}]_{\\rm{ext}}-[\\rm{nutrient}]\\bigr)\\nonumber \\\\",

    "then , it can be clearly proven with linear non - equilibrium dynamics that dissipation in the chemical reaction represents a minimum for the steady state ( for details , see the supplement ) . in general , such oscillations do not change the time scale for the equilibration , and never improve the thermodynamic efficiency .",

    "the enzyme is switched four times at @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "changes in the concentrations of atp and adp reflect this enzyme switching , whereas the concentrations of the nutrient and waste are not changed substantially at @xmath24 ( and @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is why the chemical reaction nutrient @xmath26 adp @xmath27 waste @xmath26 atp is almost relaxed to equilibrium at that time point , and the affinity of the reaction , i.e. the flux , is approximately zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the product and substrate do not change at @xmath28 ( and @xmath29 ) for the same reason .",

    ". however , this model of the thermodynamic efficiency of metabolism was originally considered in the steady state without a temporal change in chemical concentrations .",
    "therefore , to deal with the case of a time - dependent chemical reaction system , we here extend the definition of the thermodynamic efficiency as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the chemical potential ( sum of the standard chemical potential and activity due to a difference in concentration from the standard ) of chemical species @xmath35 , @xmath12 is the rate constant of the chemical reaction , and @xmath11 is the amplitude of enzyme oscillations relative to the steady state . by setting @xmath36 ( without oscillation ) , this definition ( [ eq : def_ymc ] ) is of the same form used for the steady - state metabolism model @xcite ; thus , it is a natural extension to incorporate the oscillatory case .",

    "nevertheless , it is expected that @xmath37 provides at least an approximately good measure for the efficiency of chemical energy transduction in consideration of oscillatory reaction dynamics .      in this subsection",
    ", we demonstrate the dependence of @xmath37 on the amplitude @xmath11 of the oscillation of enzyme concentrations and their average @xmath12 values .",
    "the efficiency is plotted as a function of the amplitude @xmath11 and rate constant @xmath12 in figure [ fig : heatmap ] . here",
    ", the steady state is given by @xmath36 , while @xmath38 corresponds to the switch between two separated states , in which one of the enzymes ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) vanishes so that the corresponding reaction is halted . from the numerical results in figure [ fig : heatmap ] , we find that the incorporation of oscillatory metabolism improves the average efficiency when @xmath12 is small",
    ". however , note that the average flux , @xmath39 , is not improved ( see figure s2 ) .",
    "+    in figure [ fig : kappa ] , the efficiency is compared between the steady ( @xmath36 ) and full oscillatory ( @xmath38 ) cases .",
    "this comparison further confirmed that the efficiency @xmath40 is improved with oscillations in the small @xmath12 region .",
    "note that @xmath40 is not a monotonic function of @xmath11 for a certain range of @xmath12 values .",
    "the crossover point of the amplitude at which the efficiency for the oscillation case exceeds that for the steady case depends on @xmath12 , whereas the oscillation case is always advantageous as long as @xmath12 is small .",
    "this advantage of dynamic ( chemical ) energy transduction for thermodynamic efficiency is in strong contrast with the energy conversion observed in the dynamic input change , in which the efficiency is always decreased by the oscillation , as discussed above .",
    "+  in the following , we will focus on how this observed improvement in efficiency is actually achieved .",
    "firstly , loss in efficiency is caused by the dissipation of gibbs free energy in each chemical reaction .",
    "then , the amount of dissipation is reduced when each reaction progresses close to its equilibrium . if @xmath12 , the time scale for the catalytic reaction , is sufficiently larger than that of material flux ( which is set to unity ) , the system is near equilibrium and the loss is small ; indeed , this loss is smallest at the steady state .",
    "however , when @xmath12 is small , the \" chemical coupling  between the two reactions ( anabolism and catabolism ) hinders the approach to equilibrium . in the present case ,",
    "the two reactions are coupled with the energy currency atp and adp .",
    "equilibration of catabolism results in an excess of atp compared to adp , which results in a far - from - equilibrium condition for the anabolism reaction ( of course , whether equilibration of one elemental reaction dis - equilibrates the other will depend on how the two reactions are coupled energetically ; in particular , this will depend on the values of standard chemical potentials .",
    "however , as long as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , synthesis of the product ( p ) relies on the free energy of atp synthesised from the nutrient , and this coupling form is generally true for coupling between catabolic and anabolic reactions .",
    "thus , increasing the reaction time scale of catabolism produces more atp , which then dis - equilibrates the anabolic reaction . ) .",
    "+  thus , the elemental reaction processes dis - equilibrate each other in the present coupled reaction system . in the steady state , these two reactions progress in a moderately dis - equilibrated condition when @xmath12 is small .",
    "in contrast , the oscillatory reaction can separate the process into two time regimes .",
    "the first regime is the situation for @xmath3 , in which the catabolism reaction progresses near equilibrium and the anabolism reaction occurs far from equilibrium and is almost halted as @xmath43 . on the other hand , in the time regime with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , anabolism progresses near equilibrium , and catabolism is almost halted . thus , most of the reaction events for the two temporal regimes occur near their equilibria , and thus the dissipation is suppressed in these two regimes .",
    "on the other hand , during the switch time between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the dissipation would be increased .",
    "thus , the total efficiency depends on the difference between the gain in the suppression from one of the reactions and the loss caused by the oscillation .",
    "this characteristic is not observed when the enzymes oscillate in an in - phase manner . in the in - phase oscillation ,",
    "the enzymes facilitate the catabolic and anabolic reactions equally , and each reaction hinders the approach to the other reaction s equilibrium , as observed in the steady state .",
    "+  to quantify the gain and loss of this oscillatory chemical reaction system , we calculated the energy gain @xmath48 and loss @xmath49 using the following equation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the affinity ( gibbs free energy difference ) of the reaction , and @xmath52 is the corresponding flux , where @xmath53 for catabolism and @xmath54 for anabolism ; and @xmath55 for @xmath36 ( the steady case ) and @xmath56 for @xmath38 ( full oscillatory case ) .",
    "thus , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) represents the amount of reduced ( excess ) gibbs free energy compared with that of the steady - state value .",
    "the value of @xmath12 at which the gain exceeds the loss is approximately equal to the value where @xmath57 is larger than @xmath58 , as shown in figure [ fig : kappa ] . in summary , by progressing the chemical reaction closer to the equilibrium and suppressing the reaction further from equilibrium , the efficiency is increased compared to that of the steady case .",
    "+  this improvement in efficiency can also be interpreted from a different perspective .",
    "figure [ fig : anti_phase_nwsp ] shows the time series of the flux and affinity of the catabolic reaction . when the flux is not close to zero , the affinity is close to zero , and thus the reaction progress near equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , when the affinity is not close to zero , the flux is close to zero , except at the time point of enzyme switching , and this far - from - equilibrium reaction occurs only at a very low rate .",
    "thus , thermodynamic loss is suppressed throughout the process . in figure",
    "[ fig : anti_phase_nwsp ] , we illustrate this negative correlation between flux and affinity for catabolism , which was also confirmed for anabolism .",
    "+  it is important to note that this characteristic can not be realized under the condition of linear thermodynamics without a change in the enzyme concentrations , in which thermodynamic flux increases with the affinity .",
    "thus , the flux can be controlled only by changing the affinity of the chemical reaction , and the two are always positively correlated .",
    "in contrast , in the present case , by changing the concentration of the catalytic enzyme , the time scale of the chemical reaction is changed .",
    "accordingly , the flux can be increased even for a low - affinity state , and can be suppressed for a high - affinity state .",
    "so far we have demonstrated that the thermodynamic efficiency of metabolism ( coupling between anabolism and catabolism ) can be improved by incorporation of an oscillatory chemical reaction .",
    "however , the model introduced in the last section can not generate the chemical oscillation autonomously ; thus , this model does not account for the possible energetic cost from generating the chemical oscillation . since the chemical oscillation is generated as a dissipative structure at the far - from - equilibrium condition , generating the oscillation itself",
    "requires a certain amount of excess dissipation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate whether or not a chemical reaction system capable of generating autonomous oscillation can improve thermodynamic efficiency . to address this question , we developed a three - catalyst model in which chemical oscillation appears under a given flow from resource chemicals to product .",
    "+  our model consists of nine chemical species , @xmath59 , substrate , and product .",
    "chemical reactions were constructed by coupling between catabolic ( energy - generating ) and anabolic ( energy - consuming ) reactions , as shown in the schematic in figure [ fig : repressilator ] .",
    "there are two types of catalytic reactions , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and each reaction is catalysed by @xmath62 .",
    "the system takes up @xmath63 and the substrate from the external environment , and @xmath63 is converted into @xmath64 via the above two reactions , resulting in the simultaneous synthesis of two products .",
    "the produced @xmath64 molecules and products are transported into the environment . in the model ,",
    "the reaction to covert @xmath63 into @xmath64 via @xmath65 is assumed to be a catabolic reaction , and the chemical reaction between the substrate and the product is regarded as anabolism .",
    "therefore , the reaction @xmath66 is driven by the coupled chemical reactions @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "+  in developing this model , we referred to the example of a repressilator @xcite , in which the expression of three proteins is mutually inhibited to generate the oscillation .",
    "however , given the present focus of a reaction system involving a catalytic reaction , there is no direct inhibition . instead , each of the three components",
    "@xmath62 mutually catalyse the decomposition of @xmath69 into @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath62s suppress the abundances of each other , which introduces effective mutual inhibition , as in a repressilator .",
    "+  here , for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the consumed substrate or synthesised product is quickly supplied by or transported to the external environment , respectively ; thus , their internal concentrations are kept constant .",

    "+      we now introduce the average thermodynamic efficiency of the energy transduction , as described in section 2 . in our model ( [ eq : repressilator ] ) , the reactions to convert @xmath63 into @xmath64 via @xmath65 are regarded as catabolic , and the reactions between the substrate and product are considered to be anabolism .",
    "thus , the average thermodynamic efficiency can be defined as , @xmath94 where @xmath95 indicates the affinity of the catabolic ( anabolic ) part of the chemical reaction @xmath96 , and the time for the average @xmath8 is chosen to be sufficiently long .",

    "the time courses of the flux and affinity for each reaction are shown in figure [ fig : expand ] .",
    "the flux and affinity of each chemical reaction oscillates out of phase , roughly in anti - phase .",
    "since the thermodynamic dissipation is given by the product between the flux and affinity , it can be reduced by this anti - phase oscillation between the two , as described in section 2 .",
    "+  to summarise , we introduced a simple chemical reaction system exhibiting autonomous sustainable oscillations , and confirmed that the oscillations increased the average thermodynamic efficiency , which was attributed to the anti - phase oscillation between the flux and affinity .",
    "we here report the first evaluation of the relevance of oscillatory chemical reactions to thermodynamic efficiency by introducing the nwsp model . in the model ,",
    "chemical energy is stored by transforming adp into atp via a catabolic reaction that converts an imported nutrient into waste , while an anabolic reaction consumes the stored energy to synthesise a product from a substrate , by transforming atp to adp .",
    "such a coupling structure between anabolism and catabolism forms the basis of cellular metabolism .",
    "thus , the nwsp model is regarded as a simplified , coarse - grained model for cellular metabolism .",
    "each reaction is catalysed by a corresponding enzyme .",
    "moreover , by introducing oscillations in the abundances of each enzyme , the thermodynamic efficiency of energy conversion was computed and compared between the steady and oscillatory cases .",
    "+  under the condition of enzyme limitation , in which the ( average ) enzyme abundances are insufficient and the chemical reactions can only progress slowly , we found that the oscillation in enzyme abundances improved the thermodynamic efficiency .",
    "this improvement stems from the antagonistic nature between anabolism and catabolism . in general",
    ", a catabolic reaction generates the energy currency by breaking a large macromolecule into smaller pieces , whereas anabolism consumes energy to drive the synthesis of a macromolecule .",
    "therefore , these two reaction types tend to dis - equilibrate each other , and thus they will progress far from equilibrium if they progress concurrently under a limited rate , which will consequently increase thermodynamic loss ( entropy production ) .",
    "in contrast , if sequential switching between anabolism and catabolism is achieved by oscillations in enzyme abundances , the two reactions become decoupled , and the loss is suppressed . indeed , we confirmed the improvement in thermodynamic efficiency by imposing anti - phased oscillations in the abundances of enzymes for anabolism and catabolism .",
    "+  however , the generation of such oscillation can bring about thermodynamic loss by itself . to account for this effect",
    ", we also considered a reaction model that can generate autonomous chemical oscillations , by amending the energy - transduction with three enzymes that mutually catalyse their degradation reactions , so that autonomous , repressilator - type , oscillation is possible .",
    "the model converts chemical species @xmath63 into @xmath64 via the enzymes , along with synthesis of a product from the substrate . by comparing the thermodynamic efficiency between cases ,",
    "we confirmed again that the thermodynamic efficiency is improved by the emergence of chemical oscillation .",
    "+  the common mechanism for the improvement in efficiency observed in our two models is the anti - phase oscillation between the chemical reaction flux and affinity .",
    "the anti - phase oscillation implies low flux for a high - affinity state and high flux for a low - affinity state .",
    "this situation leads to the increase in the thermodynamic efficiency , as the thermodynamic loss owing to entropy production is given by the product between the flux and affinity .",
    "+  in the present study , we focused only on a system with simplified , coarse - grained metabolism and elementary chemical reactions .",
    "however , improvement in the thermodynamic efficiency by such anti - phase oscillation between flux and affinity is expected to be a universal phenomenon for all biochemical processes involving catalytic reactions . in the case of an ordinary chemical reaction without catalytic enzymes , chemical reaction flux",
    "can only be controlled by the affinity , and the two are positively correlated ( or proportional in the case of linear thermodynamics ) @xcite . however , for an enzymatic reaction , the flux is controlled not only by the affinity but also by the abundances of the corresponding enzymes .",
    "the enzymes do not directly alter the equilibrium condition but do facilitate the tendency toward equilibration .",
    "hence , an increase in enzyme supply reduces dissipation for a single chemical reaction event @xcite . therefore ,",
    "as long as the enzyme abundance is increased with the flux , the affinity and flux will be negatively correlated if the enzyme controls the chemical reaction .",
    "+  in general , biochemical reactions in microbial experiments are often facilitated and halted by simply controlling the amount of enzymes.@xcite .",
    "therefore , the results of the present model suggest that thermodynamic efficiency in metabolism could be improved by dynamically changing the enzyme concentrations in a microbial system . for example , oscillations in gene expression have been reported in yeast grown under nutrient limitation , which is generally referred to as the yeast metabolic cycle ( ymc)@xcite . roughly speaking , expression levels of anabolic and catabolic proteins are temporally separated in the ymc , in a similar manner to the condition of our nwsp model under an oscillatory switch of the two enzymes . here ,",
    "as the nutrients are limited , the rate of the catalytic reaction is lowered , which implies a smaller @xmath12 value ( the rate constant of chemical reactions ) in our nwsp model .",
    "hence , improvement of the thermodynamic efficiency by oscillation for the small @xmath12 region observed here may provide an explanation for the experimental observations of the benefit of the ymc .",
    "+  additionally , the anti - phase oscillation between the flux and affinity also emerges in a model of the glycolytic oscillation @xcite .",
    "since glycolysis is a part of the catabolic process , we can not adopt the same definition of the thermodynamic efficiency as adopted in the present paper .",
    "however , thermodynamic efficiency for the energy conversion , defined similarly , is shown to be improved by the glycolytic oscillation @xcite .",
    "the examples of ymc and glycolytic oscillation may imply the ubiquity of the anti - phase oscillation between the reaction flux and affinity as a mechanism of improvement of the thermodynamic efficiency by enzymatic oscillation .",
    "+  in general , intracellular processes include several coupled reactions that may disequilibrate each other . one potentially effective strategy to achieve higher efficiency may be to temporally separate these reactions by switching the abundances of the corresponding enzymes for each reaction in time .",

    "<S> cells generally convert nutrient resources to useful products via energy transduction . accordingly , the thermodynamic efficiency of this conversion process is one of the most essential characteristics of living organisms . </S>",
    "<S> however , although these processes occur under conditions of dynamic metabolism , most studies of cellular thermodynamic efficiency have been restricted to examining steady states ; thus , the relevance of dynamics to this efficiency has not yet been elucidated . here </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions with anabolism - catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes . through application of external oscillation in the enzyme abundances , the thermodynamic efficiency of metabolism </S>",
    "<S> was found to be improved . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in strong contrast with that observed in the oscillatory input , in which the efficiency always decreased with oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement was effectively achieved by separating the anabolic and catabolic reactions , which tend to disequilibrate each other , and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of the antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> anti - phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through oscillation of enzyme abundances is essential . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement was also confirmed in a model capable of generating autonomous oscillations in enzyme abundances . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the possible relevance of the improvement in thermodynamic efficiency is discussed with respect to the potential for manipulation of metabolic oscillations in microorganisms . </S>"
