    "recent progress in the experimental physics of cold atoms allows for the creating of quasi - two - dimensional atomic gas either using one - dimensional optical lattices or applying tight axial trapping ketterle , schweikhard , rychtarik , smith .",
    "many properties of low - dimensional systems differ from that for the three dimensional ones .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that bose - einstein condensation is impossible in two - dimensional ( @xmath3 ) situation at any nonzero temperature , since long wavelength thermal fluctuations destroy a phase coherence .",
    "however , at low temperatures , there is still a quasi - long - range order , which disappears at the temperature of berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition . low temperature phase is often called quasicondensate , and this conception was introduced to the context of physics of alkali atoms gases in refs .",
    "shlyapnikov1,shlyapnikov2 , see also ref . @xcite . in",
    "was shown in those works that , in _",
    "finite _ low - dimensional systems , there is still a long range order at low temperatures , and one has a true condensate , but at higher temperatures , coherence is again lost , and we have a quasicondensate .    the aim of the present paper is to study thermal fluctuations in homogeneous _ spinor _ condensates .",
    "we are mainly interested in the cyclic phase of @xmath0 condensate , since it has unusual properties like phase locking and kinks , which are absent in other phases of @xmath0 condensate . in the recent experiments",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 spinor bose - einstein condensates have been created and studied .",
    "the order parameter in @xmath0 system has five components ; and , in the cyclic phase , all the particles populate three hyperfine states with @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the characteristic feature of the cyclic phase is the fact that  the ground state energy depends on the relative angle @xmath6 among the phases @xmath7 of different components of the order parameter , @xmath8 , through the spin - mixing term .",
    "this leads to the peculiar phase locking phenomena , since the energy has a term proportional to @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on thermal fluctuations of phases @xmath7 of different components of the order parameter as well as of @xmath6 .",
    "first , we solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equations and calculate the mean square fluctuations of @xmath7 .",
    "each individual phase @xmath7 in this case behaves in the way similar to the case of scalar system .",
    "namely , there is no long - range order for @xmath7 in one and two dimensions , whereas this order is kept for @xmath10 situation . at the same time , the long - range order is still preserved for @xmath11 .",
    "after this , we note that the bogoliubov - de gennes equations can be insufficient for the analysis of thermal fluctuations in the cyclic state , since this approach uses an expansion of the energy in the vicinity of one of the infinite number of equivalent minima at @xmath12 , @xmath13 being an integer number , and does not take into account a global periodic structure of the energy in functional space . in other words , @xmath9 contribution to the energy",
    "is changed by the quadratic potential well with the _ infinite _ height .",
    "one of the possible solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equations for the cyclic phase is a _ kink _ , which separates two spatial domains with @xmath6 different by @xmath14 from each other . at zero temperature ,",
    "kink is energetically unfavorable . however , at finite temperature formation of kinks can become favorable due to entropic reasons .",
    "we determine analytically the structure and energy of a single kink .",
    "also we note that our model can be mapped on the well - known sine - gordon model . for this model ,",
    "it was established before that , in low dimensions , a so called roughening transition can occur , when the system becomes unlocked from one of the minima of @xmath6 .",
    "in @xmath15 situation , a long range order for @xmath6 is absent for any nonzero temperature due to thermally - excited kinks , and the system is rough . if the system has a finite length , a nonzero temperature appears , below which still there is a long range order for @xmath16 .",
    "we estimate this temperature from simple entropic arguments . in two dimensions ,",
    "a roughening transition occurs at some finite nonzero temperature . from known results for the sine - gordon model and some simple qualitative considerations",
    "we show that the temperature of the roughening transition is close to the bkt critical temperature and possibly coincides with it .",
    "we also discuss briefly the case of ferromagnetic @xmath2 condensate .",
    "based on the solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations , we find that there is no long - range order in the one- and two - dimensional systems for the direction of spin",
    ". in finite systems , the order still exists at low temperatures , similarly to the phase coherence in scalar condensates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for @xmath0 cyclic phase and find correlation functions .",
    "in section iii we determine the structure and energy of a single kink . in section",
    "iv we discuss the order - disorder transition due to the proliferation of kinks . in section v we study the case of ferromagnetic @xmath2 condensate .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "we consider infinite homogeneous @xmath0 condensate with a given density of particles @xmath17 in zero magnetic field .",
    "the energy of the system depends on three interaction parameters @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 which can be defined as @xcite@xmath21where ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23and @xmath24 is the scattering lengths characterizing collisions between atoms with the total spin @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in real atomic condensates , @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the order parameter in @xmath0 case has five components @xmath30 @xmath31 .",

    "these states are called ferromagnetic , cyclic and polar @xcite . in cyclic phase , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an arbitrary phase ( energy of the system is degenerate with respect to @xmath39 ) .",
    "the ground state value of @xmath6 in these notations is zero .",
    "depending on values of scattering lengths @xmath24 ferromagnetic , cyclic or polar phase has the lowest energy @xcite .",
    "extended gross - pitaevskii equations can be obtained as usually from the condition of minimum of free energy of the system eq .",
    "( 5 ) . in the cyclic state , the last term in the right - hand side of eq . ( 5 )",
    "contains a spin - mixing contribution :    @xmath40    now we analyze small - amplitude oscillations of the order parameter in the cyclic phase .",
    "the fluctuations of phase of the given component of the order parameter can be expressed through the fluctuations of the order parameter itself as @xmath41 . for  @xmath42",
    ", we have @xmath43 .",
    "the deviations of the five components of the order parameter from their equilibrium values @xmath44 can be represented as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants to be found .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath48 are decoupled from that for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , as follows for the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for the cyclic phase .",
    "the spectrum for oscillations of @xmath51 , @xmath52 has three branches .",
    "for the first time , it was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and our results coincide with those results : @xmath53the thermal distribution of quasiparticles is given by ( @xmath54 , @xmath26 , @xmath55 ) @xmath56one can also find eigenvectors corresponding to the branches ( 8)-(10 ) .",
    "eigenvectors for eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) give no contribution to @xmath42 , as it can be seen from the solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations .",
    "this is the first branch ( 8) , which is responsible for the fluctuations of @xmath11 .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that only branch ( 8) depends on the value of @xmath29 , which yields the potential well for @xmath6 via the spin - mixing term ( 6 ) .",
    "finally , we obtain simple expression for @xmath42 : @xmath57    next we can determine the behavior of the mean square fluctuations of @xmath6 at large distances .",
    "we found that this quantity in all dimensions tends to a constant , when the distance tends to infinity .",
    "this means that there is a long - range order for @xmath6 .",
    "the reason is the presence of the gap in the excitation energy ( 8) . as an example , we present below the derivation and results for the @xmath3 situation . from eq .",
    "( 12 ) we have @xmath58where    @xmath59    after averaging over the time , only terms with @xmath60 survive in the expansion ( 13 ) and for the correlator we have    @xmath61 ^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { t } & = & -\\frac{1}{8\\pi vn}\\sum\\limits_{k,\\varphi _ { 1},\\varphi _ { 2}}n_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(j)}\\times   \\notag \\\\ & & \\left ( e^{ikr\\cos \\varphi _ { 1}}-1\\right ) \\left ( e^{ikr\\cos \\varphi _ { 2}}-1\\right ) ,   \\label{14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are angles between @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",

    "our calculations of the mean square fluctuations of these phases revealed the behavior , which is similar to the scalar condensate .",
    "the long - range order is absent in one- and two - dimensional situations .",
    "it is interesting to note that , at the same time , the long - range order exists for the linear combination of these phases , @xmath6 .",
    "fluctuations of populations of different hyperfine states are small at @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "in the previous section we have studied small - amplitude oscillations in the vicinity of homogeneous solution to the extended gross - pitaevskii equations .",
    "however , these equations have also a nonhomogeneous solution corresponding to the kink or domain wall between two spatial regions with values of @xmath6 different by @xmath80 from each other , since the energy of the system is degenerate with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "kinks are known to play an important role in the physics of low - dimensional systems , see e.g. the textbook @xcite .",

    "\\label{18}\\ ] ]    one can easily see from eq .",
    "( 18 ) that the minimum energy solution for the kink corresponds to the conditions @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in this case",

    "the function @xmath89 is found from the condition of minimum of @xmath90 : @xmath91 and boundary conditions .",

    "it also gives a characteristic length of the kink .",
    "the spatial structure of a single kink is presented in fig .",
    "1 , where we have plotted @xmath82-dependences of @xmath6 , @xmath77 , and @xmath76 . a single kink moving in the space is a _ soliton_. as seen from eq . (",
    "18 ) , the energy of the kink @xmath94 scales as @xmath95 .",
    "more accurate calculation based on eq .",
    "( 19 ) yields@xmath96note that in real atomic condensates @xmath29 has to be much smaller than @xmath97 and , therefore , @xmath98 should far exceed the coherence length , which has a meaning of a length - scale for the density modulations",
    ".    the same structure of the kink can be obtained from the extended gross - pitaevskii equations supplemented by the boundary conditions for @xmath16 .",
    "these equations are rather cumbersome and we do not present them here ( see e.g. our previous work @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see by the direct substitution that eqs .",
    "( 19)-(21 ) with the _ constant _ populations of each magnetic sublevel yield the _ exact _ solution to these equations .",
    "at zero temperature , the sine - gordon system in any dimension is locked in one of equivalent minima corresponding to @xmath12 . at nonzero temperature , presence of kinks",
    "can be favorable due to their entropic contribution to the free energy @xcite .",
    "kinks destroy the long - range order and lead to the rough phase , in which height of fluctuations diverges with tending the system size to infinity . in one dimensional system of length @xmath99 ( @xmath100 )",
    ", the entropy corresponding to the single kink can be estimated as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is just a number of places to put a kink .",
    "therefore , a roughening temperature is@xmath103 in the case of infinite @xmath15 system ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 ; and this result is very different from the result of small - amplitude oscillations approach , which shows a presence of long - range order for @xmath6 .",
    "relation ( 23 ) is well - known for the sine - gordon model and can be derived using more rigorous analysis , see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "note that in @xmath15 finite system , @xmath106 , as @xmath107 .    in two dimensions ,",
    "a roughening temperature @xmath108 can be also estimated in a simple manner . in this case ,",
    "@xmath94 given by eq .",
    "( 22 ) is the energy of a unit length of a kink .",
    "the critical nucleus for the formation of the rough phase is represented by the step for @xmath6  of height @xmath14  in a functional space with a perimeter @xmath109 .",
    "the total energy of such a nucleus is of the order of @xmath110 , where we have changed density of atoms @xmath17 by superfluid density @xmath111 just below the roughening transition .",
    "it is interesting to note that this energy is independent on @xmath112 .",
    "a roughening temperature @xmath108 can be estimated by equating the nucleus energy to the thermal one , @xmath113 .",
    "a more rigorous calculation for the @xmath3 sine - gordon model , based on renormalization group analysis @xcite , yields the same result:@xmath114which is independent on @xmath29 .",
    "the expression ( 24 ) for the roughening temperature coincides with the well - known result for the temperature of the bkt transition , see e.g. @xcite . to describe properly the behavior of the system in this strongly fluctuative region at high temperatures",
    ", one needs more careful and detailed analysis .",
    "however , from the considerations presented here , we can conclude that a long range order for @xmath6 in @xmath3 systems survives up to quite high temperatures ( of the order of the bkt critical temperature ) .",
    "possibly , the roughening transition occurs simultaneously with the bkt transition , and both types of topological defects , kinks and vortices , proliferate together .",
    "if the size of @xmath15 or @xmath3 finite system is less than @xmath98 ( which can be much larger than the coherence length ) , a formation of a kink is impossible , and , therefore , we expect that @xmath6 is nearly constant inside the cloud . at the same time , a value of @xmath6 can be different from @xmath115 due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "we have studied the similar situation before in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the case of harmonically trapped quasi - two - dimensional @xmath2 condensate was treated .",
    "an infinite homogeneous @xmath116 condensate in zero magnetic field can be either in polar or ferromagnetic states , where atoms populate only one or two hyperfine states and the spin - mixing terms in the energy are zero in the equilibrium .",
    "however , in the case of a trapped rotated condensate containing vortices , there are some regions on the phase diagram , where all the three hyperfine states are populated , and the energy depends on the relative phase among them @xcite .",
    "this vortex phases can be both locally and globally stable , and some of them , like mermin - ho vortex , have an axial symmetry , which makes them rather simple .",
    "another method to create such states was recently used experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a microwave energy was injected to the system leading to the redistribution of the particles from spin @xmath117 state to spin @xmath25 and @xmath118 states .",
    "we see that the cyclic phase in @xmath0 condensate is one more example of the systems , where spin - mixing is important .",
    "it is remarkable that , in this case , spin - mixing is happening in the ground state and even in absence of rotation , applied magnetic fields and other external perturbations , as in @xmath2 case . for the spin - mixing dynamics in @xmath2 condensate ,",
    "note that recently , a new experimental method for nondestructive study of internal degrees of freedom of spinor condensates was proposed in ref .",
    "in this section we discuss thermal fluctuations in spinor @xmath2 condensate .",
    "we concentrate on the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the energy of the system is independent on the direction of the spin but it depends on the gradients of spin .",
    "the similar situation exists for the phase of the order parameter in scalar condensate ( the energy is independent on its value , but depends on the gradient ) , and therefore we can expect the similar behavior , namely , absence of long - range order in low dimensions .",
    "this result was obtained before for the large class of discrete and continuous spin models chaikin .",
    "we assume that in the ground state all the atoms occupy the only one hyperfine state , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and study small - amplitude oscillations induced by the temperature . in the ground state , spin is oriented along the @xmath121-direction , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "perturbations of @xmath51 lead to that of @xmath124 and @xmath125:@xmath126@xmath127    the spectrum for the @xmath2 condensate was obtained in refs .",
    "the frequency of the mode , responsible for fluctuations of @xmath51 , is given by    @xmath128    using eqs .",
    "( 25)-(27 ) we have calculated mean square fluctuations for @xmath124 and @xmath125 at large distances and found an absence of long - range order in @xmath129 and @xmath3 cases .",
    "as an example , we show here the correlator in the @xmath3 situation:@xmath130 ^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { t}=% \\frac{t}{t_{d}}\\ln \\frac{r}{\\lambda _ { t } } ,   \\label{28}\\]]where    @xmath131    the derivation is similar to the case of cyclic phase in @xmath0 condensate , presented in section iv .",
    "the result for @xmath125 is the same . for @xmath15 case ,",
    "the correlators behave as @xmath132 .",
    "this implies that in low - dimensional systems there is no long - range order in the direction of spin .",
    "however , the @xmath133 system can be divided into blocks of a characteristic size @xmath99 , @xmath134 , with nearly the same direction of spin in each block ( @xmath135 is the spin healing length ) .",
    "different blocks are uncorrelated with each other . at temperatures of the order of @xmath136",
    ", @xmath137 becomes comparable to @xmath138 . in this case , the size of each block becomes of the order of @xmath139 .    in the quasi-@xmath15 and @xmath3",
    "trapped condensates , which have finite sizes exceeding @xmath139 , at low temperatures , one can expect the same orientation of spins throughout the system , and at higher temperatures , the cloud should consist of uncorrelated blocks .",
    "this is similar to the problem of fluctuating phase in quasi-@xmath15 and @xmath3 scalar condensates shlyapnikov1,shlyapnikov2,shlyapnikov3 .",
    "note that the case of ferromagnetic @xmath0 condensate is similar to that of spin-1 system .",
    "we have studied the effect of thermal fluctuations on homogeneous infinite bose - einstein condensate with spin @xmath0 . we were interested in the cyclic state of this system ,",
    "in which all the particles occupy three hyperfine states with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the energy depends on the relative phase @xmath8 through the spin - mixing term . using bogoliubov - de gennes equations ,",
    "we have calculated mean square fluctuations of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and found absence of long - range order in one- and two - dimensional situations , but presence of this order for @xmath6 . then , we went beyond the small - amplitude oscillations approach and mapped our problem on the sine - gordon model . a structure and energy of a single kink separating two topological sectors with different values of @xmath6 were found . in @xmath15 and @xmath3 situations , thermal proliferation of kinks",
    "can lead to the roughening transition destroying a long - range order for @xmath6 .",
    "one - dimensional infinite system is always in a rough phase , and finite @xmath15 system , as well as infinite @xmath3 system , experience roughening transition at finite temperatures , whose values we have estimated . at the end , we have also discussed thermal fluctuations in ferromagnetic @xmath2 system and found an absence of long - range order in the direction of spin in low - dimensional situations , as it can be expected from the mermin - wagner - berezinskii theorem .",
    "we defined the typical size of each block , within which still there is an order in spin degrees of freedom .",
