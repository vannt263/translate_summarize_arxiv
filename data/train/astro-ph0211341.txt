    "stars are usually observed to form in galaxies , that is , in disks , dwarfs , and starbursts . in radio galaxies ,",
    "star formation may be triggered by energetic jet outflows ( e.g. , bicknell 2000 ) .",
    "the hii region we describe here shows that isolated star formation takes place in the diffuse outskirts of galaxies , at the boundary of , if not already in , virgo intracluster space .    in nearby galaxy clusters ,",
    "a diffuse intracluster star component has been inferred from surface brightness measurements ( bernstein 1995 ) and detection of individual stars ( e.g. , arnaboldi 1996 , ferguson 1998 , feldmeier 2002 ) . its origin may be explained readily by dynamical processes acting on low - surface brightness disks and dwarfs , which unbind the stars from these galaxies ( moore 1999 ) .",
    "however , gas may be efficiently removed from infalling galaxies by ram pressure stripping ( quilis 2000 , gavazzi 2001 ) , or may be tidally dissolved , or could fall into the cluster as pristine clouds .",
    "some of this gas may form stars , which would also contribute to the diffuse component .",
    "we discuss here the current rate of such star formation from isolated compact hii regions ( ichiis ) and from jet induced star formation in a virgo cluster field .",
    "the target object was found in an emission line survey for planetary nebulae in a virgo intracluster field , centred at @xmath4 , using h@xmath5 and [ oiii ] narrow band and v+r broad band filter photometry ( arnaboldi 2002 , okamura 2002 ) , with suprime - cam on the subaru telescope . because of the large h@xmath5 to [ oiii ] flux ratio the ( unresolved ) object was classified as a candidate compact hii region .",
    "a spectrum was taken at ut4 of the vlt at paranal , on the night of april 14 , 2002 , with fors2 in mos mode .",
    "the observations were carried out with grism-150i and the order separation filter gg435 + 81 , giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath6   and a dispersion of @xmath7   pix@xmath8 .",
    "the slit width was @xmath9 arcsec , and the angular scale along the slitlet was @xmath10 arcsec pix@xmath8 .",
    "the total exposure time was @xmath11 .",
    "the nights were clear but not photometric ; the mean seeing was better than 1.0 arcsec .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars were observed at the beginning and end of the night , but cirrus clouds at these times made the flux calibration uncertain .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using standard tasks in iraf , using an arc lamp wavelength calibration and observations of a spectrophotometric standard star .",
    "the spectrum was corrected for atmospheric extinction , using a table for la silla .",
    "the wavelength and flux - calibrated spectrum is shown in figure 1 : it clearly shows a blue continuum and a number of emission lines at virgo redshift : h@xmath5 , h@xmath12 , h@xmath13 , [ oiii]@xmath14 and @xmath15 , [ sii]@xmath16 , and [ siii]@xmath17 .",
    "we do not resolve h@xmath5 and [ nii]@xmath18 , and the [ sii]@xmath19 lines , respectively , and we do not see the weaker [ oi]@xmath20 , [ oiii]@xmath21 , and [ siii]@xmath22 lines .",

    "the errors in the fluxes are approximately 10% of the h@xmath12 flux , and larger at the blue edge of the spectral range .",
    "the h@xmath5 and [ nii]@xmath18 lines are unresolved , with the [ nii]@xmath24 line appearing in the red wing of h@xmath5 . from a two - gaussian fit to the combined emission",
    "we estimate the line ratio [ nii]@xmath25}\\lambda 6548 ) \\simeq 0.17 $ ] .",
    "this is consistent with the value expected for an hii region with the large observed [ oiii]@xmath14/h@xmath12 ratio ; see below .",
    "the h@xmath5 flux given in the table is that measured as the total flux in the line reduced by one third that in [ nii]@xmath26 .",
    "the observed balmer decrement h@xmath5/h@xmath12 then becomes 4.3 .    if the intrinsic balmer decrement has the theoretical value of 2.89 for large optical depth ( case b ) and temperature @xmath27 , then e(b - v)=0.40 and a@xmath28=1.23 mag .",
    "most of this reddening is intrinsic to the source , as the galactic absorption to nearby galaxies in the virgo cluster is about a@xmath29 .",
    "line fluxes were corrected for reddening using this value of e(b - v ) and the reddening curve of cardelli ( 1989 ) . compared to h@xmath12",
    ", the corrected h@xmath13 flux is about 1.5 times larger than expected ; however , we can not regard the h@xmath13 flux as reliable , because the line lies right at the edge of the spectrum where uncertainties in the grism response , sky subtraction and determination of the continuum level will be at their worst .    the corrected line ratios [ oiii]@xmath14/h@xmath30 , [ nii]@xmath24/h@xmath31 , and [ sii ] @xmath19/h@xmath32 place the object clearly into the domain of hii regions in figs .",
    "1,2 of veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ; vo87 ) .",
    "this is also confirmed by the weakness ( non - detection ) of [ oi]@xmath33 in the spectrum .    because the flux calibration using our standard stars",
    "is uncertain , we transformed it to the jacoby ( 1989 ) m@xmath34 calibration of the imaging photometry from suprime - cam ( arnaboldi 2002 ) .",
    "this gives a total m@xmath35 magnitude for this object . because of the [ oiii ] filter width used in the emission line survey , this flux includes both the [ oiii]@xmath36 lines , as well as the flux from the continuum .",
    "using the spectrum to measure the fraction of light in the continuum , we can correct to the magnitude in the @xmath14 line only : m@xmath37 . from the standard star  calibrated spectrum , we would get m@xmath38 .",
    "the difference gives us a factor 2.63 , by which to rescale @xmath39 to match the photometric calibration .",
    "the rescaled total flux in the [ oiii ] @xmath14   line is @xmath40 . with e(b - v)=0.4",
    "the dereddened flux becomes @xmath41 .",
    "the fluxes in the other emission lines can then be inferred from the dereddened line ratios in table 1 ; in particular the h@xmath5 flux becomes @xmath42 .    the measured v - band continuum flux from the spectrum ,",
    "when applying the same calibration and correcting for reddening , becomes @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding dereddened apparent magnitude is m@xmath44 .",
    "absolute magnitudes and fluxes will be computed for a nominal virgo distance modulus of 31.16 , corresponding to @xmath45 distance ( tonry 2001 ) .",
    "however , we will sometimes keep the distance dependence by writing @xmath46 .",
    "the continuum @xmath47 then gives @xmath48 .",
    "* metallicity : * the high values of [ oiii]/h@xmath49 and [ oiii]/h@xmath50 indicate subsolar metallicity . the vo87 diagrams are not ideal for estimating metallicities , as discussed by dopita ( 2000 ) , but from figs .",
    "2,3 of that paper we estimate @xmath51 and an ionization parameter @xmath52 ( @xmath53 )",
    ". both very low and high metallicities are not consistent with their model results and these line ratios .",
    "a more accurate determination is in principle possible using the @xmath54 parameter , defined as @xmath55([sii]@xmath56+[siii]@xmath57 ) / h@xmath58 , where we have used the theoretical ratio [ siii]@xmath59/[siii]@xmath60 . from the empirical calibration of daz & prez - montero ( 2000 )",
    "we then find @xmath61 ( about 0.15 to 0.25 solar with or without the depletion factor used by dopita 2000 ) . in our case , @xmath54 has additional uncertainties due to the weak [ sii ] line and the bright nir sky lines , which might affect the [ siii ] flux . in the following ,",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath51 .    * temperature , density , ionization parameter : * unfortunately , the s / n of the spectrum is not large enough to detect the weak [ oiii]@xmath21 and [ nii]@xmath62 lines used to determine electron temperature , nor do we have lines to determine the electron density . in the following we use",
    "@xmath63 when needed .",
    "estimates of the ionization parameter from the sulfur lines , using equations ( 8) and ( 6 ) of daz ( 2000 ) give similar values to that from the vo87 diagrams : [ sii]@xmath56/[siii]@xmath64 gives @xmath65 , and [ sii]@xmath56/h@xmath66 and metallicity 0.4 solar gives @xmath67 .",
    "* luminosities : * from above , the total v - band luminosity is @xmath68 the h@xmath5 flux is @xmath69 the total number of h - ionizing photons ( osterbrock 1989 ) with recombination coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath27 is @xmath72    * stellar mass and age of starburst : * the ratio @xmath73 decreases rapidly with the mass of the most massive surviving o stars , i.e. , the age of the starburst . using the starburst99 model of leitherer ( 1999 ) for metallicity 0.4 solar and normal salpeter imf , we determine an age of @xmath74 .",
    "once this is known , the lyman continuum luminosity can be used to infer the total mass in the corresponding starburst ; we obtain @xmath75 .",
    "the number of o stars involved is 12 , so these numbers must be considered as averages .    *",
    "mass and size of gas cloud : * we can estimate the total mass of ionized hydrogen from ( osterbrock 1989 ) @xmath76         = 420 n_{100}^{-1 } d_{17}^2 \\msun , \\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the electron density and proton mass . around early o stars , the h strmgren radius is @xmath79^{1/3 }    \\simeq 3.5 n_{100}^{-2/3 } d_{17}^{2/3 } \\pc,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the fraction by number of ionized helium .",
    "this is indeed much smaller than the photometric spatial resolution ( about @xmath81 ) .",
    "the column density is @xmath82    from the inferred extinction and metallicity we may estimate the intervening hydrogen column density from the local interstellar medium relation ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) , using @xmath83 if the neutral hydrogen is in a much denser shell than the hii , then we can use the hii radius also to estimate its total mass @xmath84 the star formation efficiency would then be around 10% .",
    "the compact hii - region is located about @xmath85 ( 17 kpc projected distance ) north and @xmath86 ( 4.4 kpc ) west of ngc 4388 , almost perpendicular to the disk plane of this galaxy and @xmath87 away from the nearest part of the very extended emission - line region ( veelr ) discussed by yoshida ( 2002 ) .",
    "the radial velocity inferred from the emission lines is @xmath88 , whereas the galaxy has @xmath89 .",
    "the near - coincidence of these numbers may indicate that the hii region is , or once was , part of the ngc 4388 system . from the large radial velocity relative to the virgo center ( @xmath90 ) and from the tully - fisher distance of ngc 4388 ( yasuda 1997 ) , both are probably falling through the cluster core .",
    "this hii region is powered by a small stellar association or star cluster , with an estimated mass of @xmath0 and age of @xmath91 for a normal imf .",
    "if it is a young cluster , it must have a radius smaller than that of the hii region ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "clusters with these parameters have short relaxation times and dissolve by internal dynamical processes ; within a few @xmath93 the stars would be added to the diffuse stellar population nearby .",
    "the formation of such objects is thus possible far outside the main star forming regions in galaxies .",
    "perhaps the most plausible explanation for the observed position and velocity of the hii region relative to ngc 4388 is that it is already unbound and moving on a different orbit in the cluster potential . in this case",
    "we would be seeing intracluster star formation .",
    "if on the other hand its true distance from ngc 4388 is comparable to the projected distance so that it is still bound , we would have discovered a small star - forming knot in the far outer halo of ngc 4388 far from any other star formation activity .",
    "this would have a velocity in the frame of the galaxy comparable to the circular velocity ( @xmath94 ) of ngc 4388 .",
    "in fact , in the subaru field that contained our ichii region , arnaboldi ( 2002 ) found a small sample of similar candidate objects , among which 7 candidates are located in the outskirts of m86 , at a distance of 1015 kpc in a disturbed region which probably also contains diffuse h@xmath5 emission , and 1 such object in the outer parts of m84 .",
    "what has triggered the recent onset of star formation in this remote cloud ?",
    "notice that with its radial velocity , it will have moved @xmath95 relative to the virgo cluster , and @xmath96 relative to ngc 4388 , in the lifetime of the massive stars . thus these stars will essentially have formed in situ .",
    "a possible model could be that the cloud was compressed after entering the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) . while the typical pressure of the icm ( @xmath97 ) is far smaller than the internal pressure inferred from typical hii region parameters(@xmath98 ; @xmath99 ) , it could be comparable to that of the surrounding neutral or molecular cloud traced by the absorption",
    ". the ionized region may be reexpanding into the surrounding cloud and into the icm  the mass of the cluster is not large enough to bind the hii region .",
    "reanalysing the subaru field photometry , we have also detected a number of extended emitters in both [ oiii ] and h@xmath5 , with colors similar to the confirmed compact hii region .",
    "these are peaks in more extended emissions , and lie at distances 1133 kpc along the direction of the veelr identified by yoshida ( 2002 ) towards the ne of ngc 4388 .",
    "these objects have relatively low excitation ( [ oiii]/h@xmath100 , in agreement with fig .  6 of yoshida 2002 ) , and show continuum emission near the limiting magnitude of the combined ( v+r ) image ( arnaboldi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "their half - light radii are similar in the combined continuum and in the [ oiii ] and h@xmath5 images , which further supports the notion that these distant sources have underlying continuum emission , and are thus ionized by ob stars rather than by the nucleus of ngc 4388 . from the discussion of yoshida ( 2002 ) it is likely that this star formation is induced by the jet or ionization cone .",
    "yoshida ( 2002 ) proposed that the veelr observed to the ne of ngc 4388 could be the debris of a past interaction .",
    "although our ichii region is @xmath101 arcmin away from the nearest part of the veelr , it could also be associated with such tidal debris .",
    "the gas in this ichii region seems unlikely to come from ram pressure stripping of the gas in ngc 4388 , because the peculiar velocity of the ichii region relative to the systemic velocity of the virgo cluster is even larger than for ngc 4388 itself .",
    "( we thank b.  moore for this comment . )    the total intracluster star formation rate ( isfr ) estimated from the candidates in this field is small , however .",
    "counting the 8 ichii candidates near m86 and m84 plus 3 intracluster candidates , including that studied here , and the 6 best extended candidates , gives a total of 17 star - forming hii regions in the subaru field .",
    "if the density of these objects is typical for the virgo cluster core , these would correspond to @xmath102 such objects throughout virgo .",
    "if we adopt similar parameters to those inferred for the hii region here ( conservatively ) , we obtain from these candidates a total isfr of @xmath103 times @xmath104 per @xmath105 , in a surveyed area of 918 arcmin@xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath3 . for comparison ,",
    "the intracluster luminosity inferred from planetary nebulae in the subaru field is @xmath107 .",
    "however , it appears not impossible that at higher redshifts , when the environment of infalling galaxies was more gas - rich , formation of stars directly from this intracluster gas could have been an important part of the origin of intracluster stars in virgo .",
    "the existence of compact hii regions in virgo , beyond its intrinsic interest , is relevant for a few other issues as well .",
    "firstly , the massive stars ionizing the gas explode as type ii supernovae and enrich the virgo icm with metals .",
    "this process adds to the main metal content of the icm , which is believed to have occured at high redshift when most of the stars in the cluster ellipticals and bulges formed ( renzini 1999 ) . from the isfr",
    "inferred above , the present expected supernova rate is @xmath108 .",
    "sn ii from isolated star formation could provide the enrichment inferred for the ly@xmath5 clouds in virgo ( tripp 2002 ) .",
    "because our ichii region contains only 1 - 2 o stars , observations of the enrichment from such objects in isolated regions might give constraints on the element yields of individual supernovae .",
    "newly formed stars from this material could then have a range of abundance ratios similar to old galactic halo stars ( argast 2000 ) .",
    "secondly , compact hii regions may affect distance determinations with the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf , jacoby 1992 ) .",
    "the [ oiii ] luminosity of this ichii region places it at the bright end of the luminosity function inferred from [ oiii ] emission line surveys . in a sufficiently deep offband control image its continuum light would be visible , leading to removal from the pn sample .",
    "however , this does require a deep image , and moreover there are a few hii candidates in the subaru field for which the continuum is not detected .",
    "a few unrecognized such objects per galaxy or intracluster field could cause the distance to these fields to be underestimated .",
    "it is unclear whether this may account for the lower average distance inferred by the pnlf compared to surface brightness fluctuations ( ciardullo 2002 ) .",
    "thirdly , if compact ichii regions exist in galaxies generally , they could be the birth places of distant b stars in the galactic halo , some of which are too far from the disk to have been ejected from there into the halo ( conlon 1992 ) .",
    "most likely , their birth places would be distant high velocity clouds . at this time",
    ", however , there is no evidence for star formation in galactic high - velocity clouds .",
    "we thank r.  scarpa for efficient help at ut4 , j.  alcal for independently checking line fluxes , and a.  capetti for a helpful discussion .",
    "og thanks the swiss nationalfonds for support under grant 20 - 64856.01 .",
