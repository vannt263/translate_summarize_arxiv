    "more than two decades after pioneering works @xcite , the phenomenology related to the deconfined phase of qcd , _ i.e. _  the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is still a fascinating topic both experimentally and theoretically . on the experimental side ,",
    "the qcd matter was or is studied in heavy - ion collisions ( rhic , sps , fair , lhc ) . these experiments seem to show that the qgp behaves like a perfect fluid . on the theoretical side , the study of qcd at finite temperature deserves also much interest because it is a challenging problem in itself and because of the many connections with experiments .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the thermodynamic features of qgp by resorting to a @xmath0-matrix approach .",
    "the power of this approach is that the bound states and scattering states of the system can be studied in a whole picture .",
    "such an approach has already proved to give relevant results in the study of hadronic matter above the critical temperature of deconfinement ( @xmath1 ) @xcite but has not yet been applied to compute the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "this observable will be performed here thanks to the dashen , ma and bernstein s formulation of statistical mechanics in terms of the @xmath4-matrix ( or @xmath5-matrix )  @xcite .",
    "such a formulation is particularly well suited for systems whose microscopic constituents behave according to relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the qgp is indeed identified to a quantum gas of gluons and quarks , which are seen as the effective degrees of freedom propagating in the plasma .",
    "this assumption is actually common to all the so - called quasiparticle approaches @xcite , with the crucial difference that the use of a @xmath5-matrix formulation allows us to investigate the behavior of the qgp in a temperature range where it is strongly interacting .",
    "this strong interaction means here that bound states are expected to still survive above @xmath1 .",
    "although the above formulation can be applied to the full qgp , this paper is dedicated to the description of the gluon plasma .",
    "dealing with only one particle species simplifies drastically the problem while the main feature of the description , _",
    "i.e. _  the explicit inclusion of interactions in a quasiparticle approach , is kept .",
    "moreover , the pure gauge thermodynamic features ( in particular , the eos ) are well - known in lattice qcd ; this will allow an accurate comparison between our phenomenological approach and the lattice qcd calculations .",
    "a particularity of this paper is the generalization of the formalism to any gauge groups , with a particular attention for su(@xmath2 ) and the large-@xmath2 limit , and for g@xmath6 .",
    "this group has originally attracted attention because , the center of g@xmath6 being trivial , models relating deconfinement to the breaking of a center of symmetry are no longer valid as for su(@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , it still exhibits a first - order phase transition as su(@xmath2 ) does @xcite .",
    "hence , g@xmath6 appears quite attractive from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii is dedicated to the presentation of the general quasiparticle approach based on the @xmath5-matrix formalism proposed in  @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , the model is particularized to a yang - mills plasma with the inclusion of 2-body interactions and , in sec .",
    "iv , useful analytic comments concerning the thermodynamic observables in the su(@xmath2 ) and g@xmath6 cases are discussed .",
    "the model parameters are fixed in sec .",
    "v and the existence of the bound states inside the gluon plasma is discussed in sec .",
    "vi . in sec .",
    "vii , the computation of the eos is presented .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "viii is devoted to the conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the results of  @xcite can be summarized as follows : the grand potential @xmath7 , expressed as an energy density , of an interacting particle gas is given by ( in units where @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xmath9.\\ ] ] in the above equation , the first term , @xmath10 , is the grand potential of the free relativistic particles , _",
    "i.e. _ the remaining part of the grand potential if the interactions are turned off . the second term accounts for interactions in the plasma and is a sum running on all the species , the number of particles included , and the quantum numbers necessary to fix a channel .",
    "the set of all these channels is generically denoted @xmath11 .",
    "the vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 contain the chemical potentials and the particle number of each species taking part in a given scattering channel .    the contributions above and below the threshold .",
    "] @xmath14 are separated . below the threshold",
    ", one has @xmath15 the grand potential coming from bound states , seen as free additional species in the plasma and appearing as poles of the @xmath4-matrix . above the threshold ,",
    "one has the scattering contribution , where the trace is taken in the center of mass frame of the channel @xmath11 and where @xmath16 is the @xmath4-matrix , depending in particular on the total energy @xmath17 .",
    "the symmetrizer @xmath18 enforces the pauli principle when a channel involving identical particles is considered , and the subscript @xmath19 means that only the connected scattering diagrams are taken into account .",
    "notice that @xmath20 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , that @xmath21 is linked to the temperature @xmath0 thanks to @xmath22 , and that the notation @xmath23 is used .    by definition , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the off - shell @xmath0-matrix and where @xmath26 is the free hamiltonian of the system .",
    "a convenient way to compute @xmath25 is to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation for the off - shell @xmath0-matrix , schematically given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 the free propagator and @xmath29 the interaction potential .",
    "once the @xmath5-matrix is known , two problems can be simultaneously addressed : the existence of bound states in the plasma and its eos .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix formalism has the advantage of treating bound and scattering states on the same footing , and is particularly suited for the present situation where we expect bound states to become less and less bound when the temperature increases , eventually crossing over and melting into the continuum .",
    "this dissociation mechanism has been shown to provide considerable threshold enhancement effects in heavy quark anti - quark correlation functions @xcite",
    ".    the plasma eos is obtained from ( [ pot0 ] ) .",
    "then , the pressure is simply given by @xmath30 and the other thermodynamic observables can derived from @xmath31 .",
    "for example , the trace anomaly ( @xmath32 ) and the entropy density ( @xmath33 ) read @xmath34 _ { { \\cal v } \\text{,}\\ , \\beta\\vec \\mu } , \\quad s=-\\beta^2\\left [ \\partial_\\beta p\\right]_{{\\cal v } \\text{,}\\ , \\vec \\mu}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the volume of the system . for later convenience",
    ", the thermodynamic quantities will be normalized to the stefan - boltzmann pressure , which is defined as @xmath36 @xmath37 being the masses of the particles propagating in the medium .",
    "the explicit computation of @xmath7 obviously requires the knowledge of the on - shell @xmath0-matrix that can be derived in particular from ( [ ls ] ) .",
    "a key ingredient of the present approach is thus the potential @xmath29 , encoding the interactions between the particles in the plasma . in the following , @xmath29",
    "is chosen as pairwise : for a @xmath38-body channel , @xmath39 with @xmath40 the potential between two particle species @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "having in mind the building of an effective framework describing the deconfined phase of a non - abelian gauge theory , each particle composing the plasma should be in a given representation of the considered gauge ( or color ) group .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the potential @xmath29 between two particles in the representations @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the considered gauge group has the color - dependence of a ( screened ) one - gluon - exchange potential , that is , in momentum space , @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the generator of the considered gauge algebra in the representation @xmath47 , and where the real function @xmath48 only depends on the temperature and two momenta ( no dependence on the mass or other attributes of the particle ) .",
    "we keep the name gluon for the gauge particle even if the gauge group can formally be arbitrary . in the above definition",
    ", it has to be remembered that @xmath49 and that @xmath50 , @xmath51 being the adjoint representation of the gauge group under study and @xmath52 being the value of the quadratic casimir in the representation @xmath47 .",
    "note that in the case of su(@xmath2 ) , @xmath53 is the t  hooft coupling ( fixed in the large-@xmath2 limit ) .    introducing quadratic casimirs , one can rewrite ( [ v00 ] ) as @xmath54 with @xmath55 the pair representation and @xmath56 again , the real function @xmath57 only depends on the temperature and on two momenta  an explicit form for @xmath58 will be given later .",
    "the validity of the form ( [ v0 ] ) for @xmath40 has partially been checked in pure gauge su(3 ) lattice calculations , showing that the static potential between two sources , in different representations and bound in a color singlet , follows the casimir scaling expected from a process of one - gluon - exchange type  @xcite .",
    "the peculiar scaling ( [ v0 ] ) also leads to a relevant large-@xmath2 behavior of the eos when the gauge group su(@xmath2 ) is chosen , as it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sunt ] .    among the various possible representations ,",
    "the case where a singlet ( denoted @xmath59 ) appears in the tensor product @xmath60 is particularly relevant : since @xmath61 and the other quadratic casimirs are positive , the singlet is the most attractive channel in any two - body scattering process , so the most favorable one for the formation of bound states .",
    "such two - particle bound states should presumably be the lowest - lying ones and , being color - singlet , would give rise to low - lying glueballs or mesons for instance .      the scattering term in ( [ pot0 ] ) , given by @xmath62 can be considerably simplified by using the born approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ by noticing that if the interactions are weak enough , @xmath63 .",
    "such conditions are generally expected to be valid at high enough temperatures , where the typical interaction energy is small with respect to the typical thermal energy of the particles .",
    "note also that , in some cases , this approximation can be relevant when the factor @xmath64 is negligible , irrespective of the temperature : such cases will be encountered when the gauge group is su(@xmath2 ) ( see sec .  [ sunt ] ) .",
    "to the first order in @xmath29 , ( [ pot_s ] ) becomes @xmath65 let us write explicitly @xmath66 , where @xmath38 is the total number of particles involved in a given scattering channel , and where @xmath67 are the remaining quantum numbers .",
    "a useful remark to be done at this stage is that the pairwise structure of @xmath29 causes @xmath68 to be always vanishing excepted in two - body channels . here , at the born approximation , @xmath38 is always equal to 2",
    ". then , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that the color channel @xmath55 and the particles species @xmath41 , @xmath42 are part of @xmath67 . after having extracted from the trace the color and @xmath72 dependences ( @xmath73",
    "if the charge conjugation is not relevant ) , one is led to @xmath74 with @xmath75 is the pair representation dimension , @xmath76 the remaining trace on the momentum space and @xmath77 the potential with the angular symmetry of the considered channel .    among the various summations to be performed in @xmath78 , two are of particular interest : the one over the different interacting species , that can be denoted @xmath79 , and the one over the representations appearing in @xmath60 , that is @xmath80 .",
    "because of @xmath81 , ( [ pot_s3 ] ) is thus proportional to a factor @xmath82 for a given pair @xmath41 , @xmath42 in a given @xmath72 channel .",
    "when the combinations of species does not have to respect a symmetry principle , this last sum runs on all the representations appearing in @xmath60 ; one can then show that @xmath83 indeed , it is known in group theory that the second order dynkin indices @xmath84 in a tensor product obey a sum rule that can be rewritten using our notations as @xmath85 @xcite . using @xmath86 @xcite",
    ", one straightforwardly shows that ( [ group ] ) holds .",
    "note that ( [ group ] ) and ( [ pot_s3 ] ) are thus _ a priori _ nonzero when a symmetry principle has to be respected : the summation can not then be performed on all possible color representations .",
    "let us now particularize the general formalism presented in the previous section to a genuine yang - mills plasma , _ i.e. _  with no matter fields .",
    "the bosonic degrees of freedom propagating in the plasma are then quasigluons , that are transverse spin-1 bosons in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the baryonic potential can be set equal to 0 and according to standard formulas in statistical mechanics , one has @xmath87 where the quasigluons are _ a priori _ supposed to have a mass @xmath88 , and where @xmath89 is the grand potential per degree of freedom associated to a bosonic species with mass @xmath90 .",
    "equation ( [ psb ] ) leads to @xmath91 let us recall that in the following , the term gluon indifferently denotes the gauge field of yang - mills theory and the quasigluons .",
    "the sum @xmath92 appearing in ( [ pot0 ] ) now explicitly reads @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the number of gluons involved in the interaction process .",
    "as soon as @xmath95 , the determination of the allowed color channels and of the correct symmetrized gluon states generally becomes a painful task , to which the problem of finding the @xmath0-matrix in many - body scattering must be added .",
    "intuitively , one can nevertheless expect the dominant scattering processes to be two - gluon ones , and thus only consider @xmath96 2 in a first approach .",
    "after simplification , the grand potential ( [ pot0 ] ) eventually reads @xmath97   \\bigg\\rbrace , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbol  prime \" is the derivative respective to the energy and @xmath98 is the mass of the two - gluon bound state with color @xmath55 and quantum numbers @xmath99 , if it exists . the index @xmath100 in the @xmath72 channel is dropped since the charge conjugation is always positive for a two - gluon state @xcite . in the remaining trace",
    ", it is understood that the @xmath0-matrix has been computed in a given two - body channel with color @xmath55 and quantum numbers @xmath99 , and that the dirac @xmath101 reads @xmath102 , with the dispersion relation @xmath103 .",
    "note also that , in connection with nuclear many - body approaches , ( [ omega2 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of a weighted thermal average of scattering phase shifts by means of unitarity of the @xmath16-matrix .",
    "the computation of the two - gluon @xmath0-matrix is explained in detail in the following section .",
    "jacob and wick s helicity formalism  @xcite can be applied to describe a two - gluon state , where the gluons are seen as transverse spin-1 particles .",
    "let us generically define @xmath104 the quantum state of a particle with momentum @xmath105 , spin @xmath33 , and helicity @xmath53 .",
    "if the particle is transverse , only @xmath106 is allowed , while all the projections from @xmath107 to @xmath108 are allowed if the particle has a usual spin degree of freedom .",

    "the coordinates @xmath123 are the polar angles of @xmath105 . when both particles have a spin degree of freedom , the helicity basis , spanned by the helicity states  ( [ hstate ] ) , is equivalent to a standard @xmath124 basis up to an orthogonal transformation @xcite . when at least one of the particles is transverse , both basis are no longer equivalent , but the helicity states can still be expressed as particular linear combinations of @xmath124 states @xcite",
    ". this will be convenient in view of future computations .",
    "when the two particles are identical ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) , it is relevant to study the action of the permutation operator @xmath127 .",
