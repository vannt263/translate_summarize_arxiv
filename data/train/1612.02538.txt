    "retrieval ( pr ) is known as the recovery of an underling signal from the magnitude of its fourier transform @xcite .",

    "_ let @xmath3 be a one - dimensional sampled unknown object .",
    "we mathematically set up the phase retrieval problem in a discretized environment as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a sampled measurement , @xmath6 is the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) and @xmath7 denotes the componentwise absolute value . more generally , we can consider pr with an arbitrary linear operator @xmath8 rather than dft form of the phaseless measurements , where the data @xmath9 are collected to represent the collected measurements ] as below @xmath10      generally speaking , pr is an ill - posed and challengeable quadratic optimization problem , since there are possibly many nontrivial solutions @xcite and solving a general quadratic problem is np hard @xcite . from algorithmic perspective , the alternating projections was pioneered by gerchberg and saxton @xcite to reconstruct phase from two intensity measurements .",
    "such kind of algorithms by alternating projections has been further studied for pr with additional support set and positivity constraint in @xcite .",
    "more advanced alternating projection algorithms can be found in the review paper by marchesini @xcite . however , since the projections are onto non - convex sets , the iterative algorithms often fall into a local minimum @xcite .",
    "gradient descent schemes with adaptive steps were exploited for general pr @xcite .",
    "recently , insensitive studies focused on the algorithms with theoretically global convergence for the general pr . for instance , a global convergence for gaussian measurements was analyzed by netrapalli , jain and sanghavi @xcite .",
    "the convergence under a _ generic _ frame was proved by marchesini _",
    "@xcite , and phase - synchronization was used to accelerate the computation speed for large scale ptychographic pr .",
    "a second order trust - region algorithm was proposed by sun , qu , and wright @xcite based on the geometric analysis of pr , which returned a solution sufficient close to the ground truth by collecting about @xmath11 _ generic _ measurements .",
    "another branch of methods convexify the pr by semi - definite programming ( sdp ) based phaselift @xcite and phasecut @xcite .",
    "phasemax @xcite was developed with much less computational cost , which operates in the original signal dimension rather than in a higher dimension as sdp based methods .",
    "inspired by the success of compressed sensing @xcite , the sparsity _ prior _ was added to pr problem in order to increase the recovery possibilities and the quality of reconstructed signals , especially when the measurement is noisy and incomplete .",
    "established a shrink - wrap algorithm in @xcite by generalizing the regression model , where the support of unknown signals are slowly shrinked as iteration goes on .",

    "the @xmath2 regularization based variational method @xcite was applied to the classical pr problem .",
    "shechtman , beck and eldar presented an efficient local search method for recovering a sparse signal for the classical pr @xcite . a probabilistic method based on the generalized approximate message passing algorithm",

    "dictionary learning methods were proposed with the dictionary automatically learned from the redundant image patches @xcite .",
    "a general framework was proposed @xcite by combining the popular image filters as bm3d to denoise phaseless measurements .",
    "on the other hand , people also studied the minimal measurements to recover @xmath12sparse ] signals .",
    "ohlsson and eldar @xcite showed that at least @xmath13 fourier measurements are sufficient for such signals .",
    "eldar and mendelson @xcite proved that for the @xmath12sparse real - valued signals , @xmath14 measurements are sufficient for stable uniqueness .",

    "more related studies can be found in @xcite and references therein .      in this paper ,",
    "our discussion is based on the assumption that the signal is sparse in the original domain and may be contaminated by noises . in order to find the solution @xmath20 stated in , we set up a better - conditioned problem based on the regularization .",
    "more specifically , we introduce the @xmath0 pseudo norm as the regularization for @xmath20 due to its sparsity _ prior _ and propose the following minimization problem @xmath21 where @xmath22 the constraint in is realized by minimizing the distance between the observed magnitude @xmath23 and the value @xmath24 , which is measured by @xmath25 distance , @xmath26 .",
    "we design algorithms for the established non - convex optimization problem based on the operator splitting technique , and an alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) with dynamic steps is adopted for detailed implementation . since each subproblem has the closed - form solution , the proposed algorithms are very efficient with low computational costs .",

    "experiments are performed in section [ sec4 ] to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods from clean and noisy phaseless measurements for sparse signals .",
    "conclusions and future works are given in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "we first give a brief review of two state - of - art algorithms , _",
    "i.e. , _ sparse fieup algorithm and gespear ( a greedy sparse phase retrieval algorithm ) , and one can refer to @xcite for more related methods for sparse pr problems .        mukherjee and seelamantula @xcite proposed to solve a sparse pr problem ( spr ) , which is formulated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the known @xmath30 nonzeros .",
    "an alterative projection algorithm was proposed as @xmath31 for the @xmath32 iteration , where the projection operator is denoted as @xmath33    in @xcite , they proposed a more general models , where the set @xmath34 such that the signal is sparse by representing by some linear basis @xmath35 . in order to solve the projection @xmath36 , the omp algorithm was used . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the sparsity in the signal domain .",
    "obviously for noisy data , one can not require the underling signal belongs to the set @xmath37      shechtman , beck and eldar @xcite proposed to solve the following optimization problem @xmath38 by introducing the bound of the support set @xmath39 , a quadratic optimization problem was established as follows @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "a restarted version of 2-opt method was designed to solve it , which consists of two steps , _",
    "i.e. , _ local search method to update the current support set , and damped gauss - newton ( dgn ) method to solve a nonconvex optimization problem with the updated support set .",
    "in the first step to update the support set , a 2-opt method @xcite was used , and each time only two elements including one in the support and another in the off - support were changed .",
    "normally the 2-opt method can get stuck at local minimums .",
    "a weighted version of the objective functional with random generated weights in the above minimization problem solving by dgn was used to increase the robustness .      both above methods",
    "require to know the sparsity , which may limit their applications for real signal recovery . therefore , based on",
    ", we propose a novel variational model for pr without knowing the exact sparsity ( size of support set ) in advance , which is stated as follows @xmath42 where the parameter @xmath43 controls the tradeoff between the sparsity and data fidelity , and @xmath25 norm measures the data fidelity ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we can directly establish the existence of the variation problems .",
    "eqn . admits at least one minimizer if the general linear mapping @xmath17 is continuous .",
    "as the @xmath0 pseudo norm is lower semi - continuous , and the objective functional @xmath45 in is lower bounded , one can readily prove it and we omit the detail here .",
    "the uniqueness is hardly to guaranteed since it involves a nonconvex optimization problem .",
    "however , by letting @xmath46 , the uniqueness of the proposed variational model reduces to the uniqueness of the pr problem . as @xcite , in the absence of @xmath0 norm",
    ", one can prove the uniqueness of the pr problem .",
    "however , it is rather challengeable for the 1-d problem @xcite only from the fourier measurements , and there may exist many nontrivial solutions .",
    "thus , as the numerical experiments in section [ sec4 ] showed , the successful recovery rates are not guaranteed to be @xmath47 even when the sparsity is very strong and regularization is used , _",
    "i.e. _ , based on the minimization problem",
    ". if the uniqueness can not be guaranteed , we can only give the reliability of our proposed models for noisy free measurements in the following theorem .",
    "first , we denote the solution set ( or feasible set ) for phase retrieval @xmath48 .",
    "assume there exists @xmath49 with noisy free measurements @xmath23 which minimizes , it is the sparsest among the solution set @xmath50 , _",
    "@xmath51    it can be readily proved since @xmath52 for @xmath53 .    in the above theorem , we assume there exists a minimizer to which belongs to the solution set @xmath50 .",
    "if such assumption does not hold , for an arbitrary minimizer @xmath54 one has @xmath55 i.e. , @xmath56 then @xmath57 therefore one has @xmath58 and @xmath59 it implies that one can seek a sparser approximation for the phase retrieval problem by setting the balance parameter @xmath43 to be smaller enough , _",
    "i.e. , _ for arbitrary small @xmath60 , by selecting the parameter @xmath61 , one can find a sparser minimizer @xmath62 to , which is very close to the solution set with @xmath63    .1 in",
    "we construct an alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) with dynamical steps for solving .",
    "first , the minimization problem is rewritten as a constrained minimization problem by introducing a pair of new variables , which reads @xmath64 then , the augmented lagrangian is introduced in order to settle the following saddle - point problem @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the lagrange multipliers , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are two positive constants , and @xmath70 represents the @xmath1 inner product .",
    "we implement admm to solve , which is sketched as algorithm [ alg1 ] . in the algorithm",
    ", we dynamically update @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which starts from a given value and is multiplied by @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) at each iteration .",
    "* input : * @xmath23 , parameters @xmath43 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath73 and @xmath78 ; + * initialization : * generalize random signals @xmath79 and @xmath80 ; + * repeat *    * solve @xmath81 * solve @xmath82 * solve @xmath83 * update the lagrangian multipliers @xmath84 * @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 ;    * until @xmath88 *    note that the unknown @xmath20 can only be found up to trivial degeneracies : time - shift , conjugate - flip and global phase - change since these operations on the signal do not affect related autocorrelation .",
    "therefore , we apply corresponding corrections to trivial solutions in the numerical experiments .      in the following ,",
    "we discuss the solution to each sub - minimization problem .",
    "the sub - minimization problem of @xmath20 can be written as @xmath89 we shall compute the first order optimal condition for the above problem w.r.t the complex variable @xmath20 . by separating the real and complex parts of the complex - valued variable as @xcite , we are readily to obtain the following euler - lagrange equation of @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the identical operator if @xmath92 obviously , there is the closed - form solution to for the following two kinds of linear operators satisfying .",
    "one is that the operator @xmath93 is the normalized discrete fourier transformation , _",

    "<S> we study the problem of recovering the underlining sparse signals from clean or noisy phaseless measurements . due to the sparse _ prior _ of signals , we adopt an @xmath0 regularized variational model to ensure only a small number of nonzero elements being recovered in the signal and two different formulations are established in the modeling based on the choices of data fidelity , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath1 and @xmath2 norms . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose efficient algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) with convergence guarantee and nearly optimal computational complexity . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the existence of closed - form solutions to all subproblems , the proposed algorithm is very efficient with low computational cost in each iteration . </S>",
    "<S> numerous experiments show that our proposed methods can recover sparse signals from phaseless measurements with higher successful recovery rates and lower computation cost compared with the state - of - art methods .    </S>",
