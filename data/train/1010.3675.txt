    "an unbinned maximum likelihood fit with a gaussian ( signal ) and a first order polynomial ( background ) is performed .",
    "the mass width with both muons in the end - cap region is about 2.5 times wider than one with both muons in the barrel .",
    "this behavior is caused by the higher amount of detector material and the shorter effective trajectory in the magnetic field in the forward region .",

    "are measured  @xcite .      selections of @xmath6 is similar to those in subsection  [ withjpsi ] .",
