    "one of the testing ground of grand unified theories is the strict unification of the three coupling constants @xmath1,@xmath2 and @xmath3 of the standard model @xmath4 at some high scale ( @xmath5 ) , using as inputs their experimental values at the z - pole mass . the coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be determined from the accurate experimental measurement of @xmath6 and @xmath7 at @xmath8 pole mass .",
    "the world average values for @xmath8,@xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xcite ,    [ 1 ] @xmath9    the coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 gauge are related to @xmath6 and @xmath7 as ,    @xmath12    the strong coupling constant ( @xmath3 ) has also been measured , its world average value is ; @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that qcd can not tolerate such a large @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "several low energy experiments also indicate that @xmath3 must be close to 0.11 @xcite , @xmath14 below the z - peak value measured at collider experiments .",
    "theoretically clean deep inelastic scattering experiments give @xmath15 @xcite . a new analysis of the @xmath16 sum rule yield @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "similar values are obtained in lattice qcd : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 spectrum ) @xcite and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 spectrum ) @xcite .",
    "the apparent conflict between the low energy and the collider energy z - peak determination of @xmath3 may be due to the higher order corrections to the lep values .",
    "preliminary analysis suggests that these higher order correction may bring down the collider values to be consistent with the low energy measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed it has also been argued that the systematic error usually quoted in lep number is grossly underestimated , and the lep can only claim to determine the strong coupling constant within the limit , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it is now established that the standard model is inconsistent with gauge unification , with the experimentally measured coupling constants @xcite . at early 90 ,",
    "the measurements were consistent with the gauge unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "recently langacker and polonsky @xcite using the recent electroweak data found that in mssm , @xmath23 is required for strict gauge unification .",
    "this value is considerably higher than the world average value of @xmath24 .",
    "also it is much above the low energy measurements and qcd motivated value of @xmath25 . in the context of mssm",
    "the lower @xmath3 require raising the susy particle masses considerably higher than the 1 tev scale .",
    "however , susy mass spectra considerably higher than 1 tev scale will have problem of diverging radiative correction . also , heavy susy masses will be inconsistent with our expectation that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) will be neutral and the candidate for the dark matter . the other possibility , to reconcile @xmath26 with gauge unification , is to assume very large negative heavy threshold correction at gut scale and nro s which could decrease @xmath27 by 10% @xcite .",
    "recently , roszkowski and shifman @xcite argued that in the simple supersymmetric extension of the standard model , one need not have the constraint of universal gaugino masses at the gut scale , which is , in general assumed in mssm . to fully specify the mssm , one needs to invoke the supersymmetry breaking pattern . the soft breaking term , which in essence couple the mssm with the n=1 supergravity give rise to the constraint of universal gaugino masses at gut scale .",
    "thus in a pure phenomenological approach , one can relax the condition of universal gaugino masses .",
    "they showed that by relaxing the constraint small @xmath3 compatible with low energy measurements can be obtained@xcite . in that case , gluino becomes lighter than the wino and can be well below 200 gev @xcite .",
    "however , the approch is unsatisfactory , as there is no theoretical scheme for the symmetry breaking term .    in the present paper",
    ", we show that consitent gauge unification with small @xmath3 is not possible within the framework of mssm .",
    "our approah is phenomenological .",
    "we keep the constraint of universal gaugino masses .",
    "we treat the higgsino masses as a parameter of unification , and tune it to obtain unification for a given value of @xmath3",
    ". gauge unification with @xmath28 0.11 , require higgsino masses in the range of @xmath29 gev , three order of maginitude larger than other sparticle masses .",
    "higgsino masses in the range of @xmath29 gev will require that the supersymmetry break at that scale only and the model will face the unsatisfactory aspect of gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , we describe the model briefly , in section 3 , the results obtained will be discussed .",
    "summary and conclusions will be given in section 4 .",
    "the renormalisation group equations for the gauge couplings are given by ( neglecting the small yukawa couplings ) ,    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , with q the running scale and @xmath5 the unification scale mass .",
    "the one loop coefficients @xmath32 of the @xmath33 functions for the gauge couplings change across each new running mass threshold . in the mssm",

    "the @xmath40 stands for the heavy higgs boson doublet @xcite .",
    "the effect of low mass threshold on two loop beta function is expected to be small . in the weak scale ,",
    "we thus use the sm values :    @xmath41    and from the weak to the gut scale , we use ,    @xmath42    the rge equations can be integrated in a step function approximation to obtain @xmath43 at a scale @xmath44 for a given @xmath45 ,    @xmath46    with    @xmath47    the eq.[2 ] can be solved iteratively to obtain the coupling constants at any arbitrary energy , knowing their value at a given energy .",
    "in addition to the above equations , we consider the evolution of gaugino masses",
    ". there evolution equations are simple ,    @xmath48    with the boundary condition at @xmath5 : @xmath49 .",
    "the solution for the gluino and the winos can be written as ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the unified coupling constant at the gut scale . combining the two equation we obtain ,    @xmath52    for a given @xmath53 , @xmath54",
    "can be obtain iteratively from eq.[3 ]    the simple step - function approximation used to integrate the rg equations is justified only in @xmath55 scheme .",
    "however , the experimental @xmath6 and @xmath7 were obtained in the @xmath56 scheme .",
    "we therefore convert the coupling constants into the @xmath55 scheme by ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we note that apart from the winos and the gluino , the beta function coefficients are most affected by the higgsinos .",
    "not only they appear in two beta function @xmath60 and @xmath61 , compared to other sparticles , their coefficients are also larger .",
    "we therefore choose the higgsino mass as the parameter which will be tuned to obtain strict gauge unification with recent electroweak data .",
    "the wino and the gluino will be treated separately as they are connected by the universal gaugino mass at gut scale .",
    "all the other susy masses will be assumed to be degenerate at a common mass ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this is certainly an assumption , however , it helps to identify the role of higgsinos in the unification process .",
    "we define the gut scale @xmath63 as the scale where all the three coupling constants unify at some value @xmath51 .",
    "the rg equations for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath64 were run simultaneously from @xmath8 to @xmath5 .",
    "the input @xmath1 and @xmath2 were calculated from the experimental @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( eq.[1 ] ) .",
    "we have used the central value for @xmath6 .",
    "unification of three forces is sensitive to the input value of @xmath7 .",
    "this sensitivity is due to the fact that @xmath2 does not change much between @xmath8 and @xmath5 , as do the other two couplings .",
    "thus a small change in @xmath7 has an enhanced effect on the unification .",
    "we therefore consider two input values of @xmath7 : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , covering the @xmath67 variance .",
    "for the input strong coupling @xmath3 , we choose a value between 0.10 - 0.13 . for a given wino mass ( @xmath53 ) and the common susy mass @xmath68",
    "we vary the higgsino mass ( @xmath69 ) 100 gev onwards to find the minimum @xmath69 required for the strict unification of the three couplings .",
    "the gluino mass was obtained iteratively from eq.[3 ] .    in fig.1a , we have shown the higgsino mass @xmath69 required to obtain strict gauge unification , as a function of the input @xmath3 .",

    "strict unification is possible with higgsino mass as well as all the other sparticle masses in the range of tev scale .",

    ", strict gauge unification is obtained with @xmath84 ) gev for @xmath7=0.231(0.232 ) .    in the above calculations ,",
    "the mass of the winos ( @xmath53 ) were fixed at 1000 gev . to observe the effect of wino mass on the unification , with small @xmath3 , we now vary @xmath53 from 100 gev to 2000 gev .",

    "the higgsino mass depends on the input @xmath7 . within its @xmath67 variation",
    ", it is changed approximately by a factor of 10 .",
    "however , the higgsino mass required for unification shows a weak dependence on the wino mass . as the wino mass is varied from 100 to 2000 gev , the higgsino mass is decreased by a factor of 5 only .",
    "interestingly , we find that after 1000 gev , the the higgsino mass remains nearly same .",
    "variation of the gut scale and inverse of the unified coupling with the wino mass is shown in fig.2b and 2c .",
    "as before , they are anti - correlated . while @xmath5 shows weak dependence on the input @xmath7 , @xmath76 do not exhibit any such dependence .",
    "there dependence on the wino mass is also weak .",
    "here also , after @xmath53=1000 gev , rate of variation of @xmath5 and @xmath76 slows down .",
    "the variation of the ratio @xmath77 with the wino mass is shown in fig.2d .",
    "the ratio do not depend on the input @xmath7 .",
    "it decreases with the wino mass . again after 1000 gev , the rate of decrease is slowed down and the relation @xmath85 become valid . in fig.2e , the universal gaugino mass @xmath78 and its variation with the wino mass is shown .",
    "@xmath78 do not show any dependence on the input @xmath7 .",
    "as expected , it increases linearly with the wino mass .",
    "the results indicate that the unification of three forces with @xmath83 depend weakly upon the wino mass . increasing the wino mass beyond 1000 gev , does not affect the unification appreciably .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the common susy mass @xmath62 on the unification process with @xmath3=0.11 .",
    "the wino mass was fixed at 1000 gev . in fig.3a , the variation of the higgsino mass with @xmath62",
    "the input dependence of @xmath7 on the higgsino mass is again manifest .",
    "the higgsino mass shows a very weak dependence on the common susy mass @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the gut scale ( fig.3b ) , the unified coupling ( fig.3c ) , the ratio @xmath77 ( fig.3d ) and @xmath78 ( fig.3e ) shows very weak dependence on the input @xmath62 .",
    "thus the unification of three forces with @xmath83 is insensitive to the common susy mass @xmath62 within the range 500 - 2500 gev .",
    "thus a more accurate susy mass spectra will not alter the present results significantly .",
    "the present analysis indicate that low energy qcd motivated strong coupling constant @xmath86 is consistent with gauge unification in mssm , if the higgsino masses are in the range of @xmath82 gev and other susy masses are in the tev range . in the following",
    "we will examine its effect on some other features of the model .",
    "any gut theory must consider the nucleon decay rate in the model .",
    "as the gut scale obtained presently exceeds @xmath87 gev , we do not expect problem from the direct proton decay @xmath88 .",
    "however , nucleons can decay via exchange of color - triplet higgs multiplet @xcite , through the dimension five operator .",
    "the color triplet higgs mass @xmath89 , then has significant observable effect .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath89 from nucleon - decay experiments can be obtained as @xcite ,    @xmath90    we have calculated the color triplet higgs mass in our model . following @xcite , we write at the gut scale ,    @xmath91    the first term of the rhs corresponds to heavy threshold correction at gut scale as a function of the color triplet higgs mass @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the second term is the light threshold correction at the weak scale ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "( we note that in the calculations presented at earlier sections , we have not taken into account the heavy threshold effects .",
    "however , if the heavy thresholds are much heavier than the gut scale , then the results obtained previously will not be altered ) . for strict unification at the gut scale ,",
    "the lhs of the above equation is zero and we can find the color triplet higgs mass in terms of the susy masses . in the above equation all the susy particles",
    "are assumed to be degenerate at a common mass @xmath93 .",
    "however , as we have treated the winos , gluino and the higgsinos separately , the the second term is to be replaced by    @xmath94    in fig.4 , we have shown the variation of the color triplet higgs mass @xmath89 with the wino mass @xmath53 as obtained from strict gauge unification .",
    "the strong coupling was fixed at 0.11 .",
    "the common susy mass @xmath62 was fixed at 1000 gev .",
    "as discussed earlier , for a given wino mass the unification was obtained by varying the higgsino mass only .",
    "color triplet higgs mass depend on the input value of @xmath7 , lower @xmath7 results in a higher value for the color triplet higgs mass .",
    "within @xmath67 , the value is changed approximately by a factor of 10 .",
    "@xmath89 also depend on the wino mass .",
    "as the wino mass is increased its value is decreased .",
    "however , 1000 gev onwards , the rate of decrease is slowed down .",
    "we observe that the color triplet higgs mass @xmath89 as obtained presently is much above the lower limit ( @xmath95 gev ) required to respect the experimental nucleon decay rate .",
    "the result suggest that large higgsino mass will not cause rapid proton decay through the dimension five operator .      about the lsp being the candidate dark matter",
    ", we observe that the higgsinos mixes with gauginos ( both are spin 1/2 particle ) to give the neutralino s . in the limiting case when @xmath96,@xmath97 and @xmath69 >",
    "> @xmath8 , the bino and the neutral wino do not mix with each other nor they mix with the higgsinos .",
    "thus binos can still be the lsp and the candidate for the dark matter .",
    "thus if only the higgsinos are in the mass range @xmath82 gev , and all the other s - particles are in the tev range , the model will not suffer from radiative correction at the electroweak scale .",
    "also the expectation that bino s are the dark matter candidate need not be altered .",
    "one of the motivation of introducing the supersymmetry is the gauge hierarchy problem , i.e. existence of very small and large mass scale in nature . in su(5 ) , as well known , the tree level parameters needed to be fine tuned to an accuracy of @xmath98 or so , in order to obtain the mass ratio @xmath99 .",
    "however , tree level fine tunings are upset at higher order due to quadratic radiative corrections and su(5 ) is in problem .",
    "this need not happen in supersymmetric theories due to the nonrenormalisation theorem of grisaru , rocek and siegel @xcite . according to this theory , which is valid for exact or softly broken supersymmetry",
    ", the parameters of the super potential do not only receive infinite renormalisation but they also do not receive finite renormalisation in higher orders .",
    "thus the parameters , once fine tuned at tree level to obtain hierarchy , the radiative correction donot disturb the hierarchy at higher order . thus problem of gauge hierarchy in supersymmetric model is not as severe as in su(5 ) .",
    "also , in supersymmetric theories , logarithmic dependence of radiative corrections makes the emergence of high mass scale from a low mass scale quite natural .",
    "however , with the higgsino mass in the scale of @xmath29 gev , effective breaking of supersymmetry will occur at that scale only .",
    "the effective theory below that scale will not be protected by the non - renormalisation theory .",
    "quadratic divergences will be generated in higgs mass due to absence of higgs - higgsino - gaugino coupling at low energy .",
    "with higgsino mass in the range of @xmath29 gev , the corrections to the higgs mass will be of that scale and correct electroweak scale can not be achieved without fine tuning .",
    "thus we find that if the strong coupling constant is small as obtained in qcd experiments , gauge unification with recent electroweak data can be achieved , alongwith universal gaugino masses , only if we abandon one of the primary motivation of supersymmetry , namely the resolution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "also generating three order of hierarchy among the sparticles will be difficult to obtain in any theoretical framework .",
    "the discussion suggests that consistent gauge unification with @xmath100 is not possible within the frame work of mssm .",
    "we have studied the gauge unification in the mssm with respect to the higgsino masses .",
    "the purpose of our study was to find whether with @xmath100 gauge unification is possible in the mssm with universal gaugino mass at gut scale .",
    "our approach is phenomenological .",
    "we choose the higgsino mass as a parameter . for a given wino mass ,",
    "it was tuned to obtain gauge unification .",
    "the gluino mass was obtained iteratively from the condition that at gut scale the winos and the gluino have a common mass @xmath78 .",
    "all the other sparticle masses were assumed to be degenerate at a common mass @xmath68 .",
    "the rg equations were run from @xmath8 to the gut scale , with the beta function coefficients changing at appropriate masses .",
    "we find that if @xmath3 ranges between 0.10 to 0.13 , with the recent electroweak data , it is possible to unify all the three forces by varying the higgsino mass between @xmath101 gev .",
    "all the other sparticles can be in the tev scale .",
    "the result is insensitive to the wino mass or the common mass @xmath62 .",
    "thus a more accurate susy spectra will not alter the results significantly .",
    "it was found that if @xmath102 , as measured in qcd experiments , gauge unification require higgsino masses in the range of @xmath29 gev , three order of magnitude higher than other sparticle masses .",
    "colour triplet higgs were also calculated and found to be heavy enough to forbid rapid proton decay .",
    "however , with higgsino masses in the scale of @xmath29 gev , supersymmetry breaks at that scale only and problem of gauge hierarchy resurface .",
    "one of the fundamental motivation of introducing supersymmetry is then lost .    to conclude , if @xmath3 is indeed small , as measured in qcd experiments , then consistent gauge unification within mssm is not possible . however , mssm is merely the simplest extension of standard model with supersymmetry .",
    "it is possible that with a more complicated model a consistent picture will emerge .    akc@veccal.ernet.in review of particle physics , particle data group , , 1 ( 1996 ) .",
