    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc ) , surrounded by a lead / scintillating - fiber electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "a superconducting coil around the calorimeter provides a 0.52 t field . the drift chamber , 4  m in diameter and 3.3  m long , is described in ref .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath30 .",
    "two track vertices are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of  3  mm .",
    "the calorimeter , described in ref . , is divided into a barrel and two endcaps , for a total of 88 modules , and covers 98% of the solid angle .",
    "the modules are read out at both ends by photomultipliers providing energy deposit and arrival time information .",
    "the readout segmentation provides the coordinates transverse to the fiber plane .",
    "the coordinate along the fibers is obtained by the difference between the arrival times of the signals at either end .",
    "cells close in time and space are grouped into calorimeter clusters .",
    "the energy and time resolutions are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the kloe trigger , described in ref . , uses calorimeter and chamber information . for this analysis ,",
    "only the calorimeter signals are used .",
    "two energy deposits above threshold ( @xmath33 mev for the barrel and @xmath34 mev for the endcaps ) are required .",
    "recognition and rejection of cosmic - ray events is also performed at the trigger level .",

    "the maximum luminosity reached by da@xmath23ne was 7.5;31 ; cms , and in september 2002 ,  delivered 91.5 pb .",
    "we collected data in 2001 - 2002 for an integrated luminosity   = 450 pb@xmath3 .",
    "a total of 1.4 billion @xmath24 mesons were produced , yielding 450 million -  pairs .",
    "assuming br(@xmath7 ) = 1.9;-9 ; , 1 signal event is expected to have been produced .",
    "the mean decay lengths of the @xmath6 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 cm and @xmath37 cm at da@xmath23ne .",
    "about 50% of @xmath35 s reach the calorimeter before decaying .",
    "the @xmath35 interaction in the calorimeter ( ``  crash '' ) is identified by requiring a cluster with energy greater than 100 mev that is not associated to any track and whose time corresponds to a velocity in the @xmath24 rest frame , @xmath38 , of  0.2 .",
    "the -crash provides a very clean @xmath6 tag .",
    "the average value of the center - of - mass energy , @xmath39 , is obtained with a precision of 30 kev for each 100 nb@xmath3 running period ( of duration @xmath40 hour ) using large - angle bhabha events . the value of @xmath39 and the @xmath35-crash cluster position allows us to establish , for each event , the trajectory of the @xmath6 with an angular resolution of 1@xmath41 and a momentum resolution better than 2 mev .    because of its very short lifetime",
    ", the displacement of the @xmath6 from the @xmath24 decay position is negligible .",
    "we therefore identify as  decay photons neutral particles that travel with @xmath42 from the interaction point ( ip ) to the emc .",
    "each cluster is required to satisfy the condition @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the photon flight time and @xmath45 the path length ; @xmath46 also includes a contribution from the finite bunch length ( 23 cm ) , which introduces a dispersion in the collision time .    in order to retain a large control sample for the background",
    "while preserving high efficiency for the signal , we keep all photons satisfying @xmath47 7  mev and @xmath48 0.915 .",
    "the photon detection efficiency is 90% for @xmath49 = 20 mev , and reaches 100% above 70 mev .",
    "the signal is searched for by requiring six prompt photons after tagging .",
    "the normalization is provided by counting the @xmath50 events in the same tagged sample .",
    "the response of the detector to the decay of interest and the various backgrounds is studied using the monte carlo ( mc ) program geanfi @xcite .",
    "geanfi accounts for changes in machine operation and background conditions , following the machine conditions run by run , and has been calibrated with bhabha scattering events and other processes .",
    "the response of the emc to  interactions is not simulated but has been obtained from a large sample of -mesons tagged by identifying @xmath51 decays .",
    "this not only gives accurate representation of the emc response to the @xmath35 crash , but also results in an effective 40% increase in mc statistics .",
    "the -crash efficiency cancels in the final 3/2  ratio to better than 1% and we assign a 0.9% systematic error to the final result due to this source .",
    "backgrounds are obtained from mc @xmath52 events corresponding to an integrated luminosity   = 900 pb .",
    "we also use a mc sample of @xmath53 events for   = 450 pb@xmath3 and a mc sample of radiative   decays for   = 2250 pb@xmath3 .",
    "a sample of  @xmath54 @xmath7 mc events is used to obtain the signal efficiency .",
    "to test how well the mc reproduces the observed photon multiplicity after tagging , we determine the fraction of events of given multiplicity , @xmath55 , defined as @xmath56 as shown in table [ tab : fraction ] , there is a significant discrepancy between data and monte carlo for events with multiplicity five and six .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    adding in quadrature all sources we obtain a total systematic error of 12% on the background estimate . to determine the systematics",
    "related to the analysis cuts for the signal , we have first evaluated the effect of the track veto . using the mc signal sample",
    ", we estimate a vetoed event fraction of ( 3.7 @xmath57 0.1)% .",
    "the data - mc ratio of the cumulative distributions for the track - vetoed events in the tagged six - photon sample is @xmath58 , which translates into a 0.2% systematic error on the track - veto efficiency .    because of the similarity of the @xmath59 distributions for the tagged four- and six - photon samples , as confirmed by mc studies , an estimate of the systematic error associated with the application of the @xmath59 cut can be obtained from the data - mc comparison of the cumulative @xmath59 distributions for the four - photon sample .",
    "the systematic error arising from data - mc discrepancies in the @xmath59 distribution is estimated to be 1.8% by this comparison .",
    "moreover , the efficiency changes related to differences between the calorimeter resolution and energy scale for data and mc events have been studied in a manner similar to that previously described for the evaluation of the systematics on the background .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the analysis efficiency are summarized in table  [ tab : syst_bkg_ana ] . adding all sources in quadrature we quote a total systematic error of 2.1% on the estimate of the analysis efficiency .",
    "at the end of the analysis , we find 2 events in the signal box with an estimated background of @xmath60 .",
    "to derive an upper limit on the number of signal counts , we build the background probability distribution function , taking into account our finite mc statistics and the uncertainties on the mc calibration factors .",
    "this function is folded with a gaussian of width equivalent to the entire systematic uncertainty on the background . using the neyman construction described in ref .  , we limit the number of @xmath61 decays observed to 3.45 at 90% c.l . , with a total reconstruction efficiency of @xmath62 .",
    "in the same tagged sample , we count 3.78;7 ; @xmath63 events .",
    "this number is used for normalization .",
    "finally , using the value br(@xmath63 ) = 0.3105  0.0014  @xcite we obtain : @xmath64 which represents an improvement by a factor of @xmath656 with respect to the best previous limit @xcite , and by a factor of 100 with respect to the best limit obtained with a direct search  @xcite .",
    "the limit on the br can be directly translated into a limit on @xmath66 : @xmath67    this result describes a circle of radius 0.018 centered at zero in the @xmath68 , @xmath69 plane and represents a limit @xmath70 times smaller than the result of ref .  .",
    "as follows from the discussion in that reference , our result confirms that the sensitivity of the ",
    "test from unitarity is now limited by the uncertainty on @xmath71 .",
