    "meridional flows in the solar interior have recently become the focus of observational and theoretical attention . poleward sub - surface flows with amplitudes of the order of a few tens of meters per second have been detected with reliable accuracy down to about 0.85@xmath0 ( giles _ et al .",
    "a globally equatorward return flow must exist deeper in the interior to guarantee mass conservation , but its amplitude and structure can only be conjectured currently .",
    "this paper addresses the question of how deeply these meridional flows penetrate into the radiative zone .",
    "an understanding of these return meridional flows is of fundamental importance since their nature plays a crucial role in many current theories for the internal magneto - hydrodynamics of the sun .",
    "firstly , meridional circulations have been argued to play a central role in the operation of the global solar dynamo ( see the review by charbonneau , 2005 ) . in these models ,",
    "the predicted spatio - temporal behavior of the solar cycle depends sensitively on the assumed circulation pattern and speed .",
    "the chosen position for the return flow coupled with mass conservation sets the velocity of the equatorward flow near the base of the convection zone and therefore controls the activity cycle period .",
    "similarly , the depth of penetration of the meridional flows into the radiative region determines where the toroidal magnetic field is generated , and therefore also influences the cycle period and the field amplitudes .",
    "secondly , meridional flows advect angular momentum , and therefore play a key role in the global dynamical balance of the solar interior . for example",
    ", helioseismology has revealed the existence of a strong radial shear layer , now known as the solar tachocline ( brown _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; spiegel & zahn , 1992 ; hughes , rosner & weiss , 2007 ) , located precisely at the interface between the radiative and convective regions .",
    "quantitative models of the tachocline have revealed a sensitive dependence of the interior angular velocity profile on the derived or assumed interfacial flows ( spiegel & zahn , 1992 ; gough & mcintyre , 1998 ; rempel , 2005 ; garaud , 2007 ) .",
    "finally , meridional flows also transport various chemical species within the solar interior , with directly observable consequences . near the base of the convection zone , mixing by large - scale flows can prevent the gravitational settling of helium with respect to hydrogen , leaving a noticeable signature in the helioseismic sound - speed data ( elliott & gough , 1999 ) .",
    "additional mixing below the convection zone in the main - sequence phase is also required by the observed surface abundances of light elements such as lithium and beryllium , with plausibly the same origin . flows with amplitudes on the order of tens of meters per second are required to balance angular momentum transport by the turbulent stresses throughout the convection zone ( miesch _ et al_. 2000 ) .",
    "since there exist no physical barrier between the convective and radiative regions , these convectively driven flows may continue their downward progress somewhat beyond the driving region into the radiative zone , thereby `` penetrating '' or `` overshooting '' into the interior while retaining potentially significant velocities .",
    "how far flows extend beyond their driving region is an essential question .",
    "the problem has recently been addressed by gilman & miesch ( 2004 ) ( gm04 hereafter ) and by mcintyre ( 2007 ) . using a steady - state formalism , gm04 discuss the depth of penetration of an existing _ latitudinal _ flow into the radiative interior .",
    "they argue that the source flow amplitude is rapidly damped in the radiative interior within a shallow ekman depth .",
    "this depth ranges from a fraction of a kilometer , using microscopic values of the viscosity , to a few tens of kilometers , using a turbulent value of the viscosity .",
    "gilman and miesch reach a strong conclusion , namely that _ `` the physics of the solar tachocline and neighboring regions does not allow penetration of meridional circulation originating in the solar convection zone below the overshoot layer''_. this could have dramatic consequences for the magneto - hydrodynamics of the solar radiative zone",
    ".    however , steady - state solutions are sensitively dependent on boundary conditions .",
    "gm04 solve the problem for the radiative interior dynamics where the forcing is by purely latitudinal flows at the upper convective - radiative interface .",
    "they do not consider interfacial forcing from flows generated by the differential rotation nor by direct radial pumping into the radiative zone ( only radial flows generated for mass conservation in response to their latitudinal forcing ) .",
    "it is reasonable to address the question as to whether their strong conclusion remains applicable under more general circumstances .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore extend the work of gm04 to allow for greater generality in the source forcing flow , allowing the possibility of azimuthal and radial flows in addition to the latitudinal flows .",
    "we systematically examine the consequences of using these various sets of boundary conditions to mimic the convective - radiative interface .",
    "we find that the meridional flows can penetrate to significantly different depths , depending upon the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "the gm04 solution can be recovered in special cases , but is typically overpowered by other solutions when alternative assumptions are made about the nature of the flows driven within the convection zone .    in what follows ,",
    "we adopt a three - step approach to study the penetration of meridional flows into the solar radiative zone . given the added difficulties inherent to spherical coordinate systems , we first examine the problem in cartesian geometry . in ",
    "[ sec : cart ] , we study analytically the complete set of steady , linear , pseudo - axisymmetric boussinesq equations and explore a wide range of boundary conditions that may possibly mimic the effects of the convection zone on the radiative zone .",
    "we systematically discuss the solutions obtained , which are linear combinations of two fundamental modes of behavior .",
    "one of these modes is a solution which varies rapidly on a typical shallow ekman scale as found by gm04 , the other one is a more slowly varying solution which can span the entire interior . in order to gain better insight into the physics of the system and in particular the new solutions , in  [ sec : toy ] we consider a simplified cartesian boussinesq model in which the solutions related to the ekman layers are artificially suppressed by neglecting the viscous terms in the radial and latitudinal components of the momentum equation .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : num ] , we relax the cartesian constraint and present numerical results for all of the various boundary conditions in a steady , linear , anelastic , spherical but axisymmetric simulation of the solar radiative zone .",
    "we compare these numerical results in spherical geometry with the analytical predictions from the cartesian models , both in terms of the scale of variation of the solutions , and in terms of their predicted flow velocities .",
    "while the spherical geometry as well as the non - uniform background state necessarily add to the complexity of the problem , we find that the analytical scalings extracted from the cartesian geometry models agree very well with the full numerical solutions .",
    "when more complex boundary conditions are taken into account , limits on the penetration of meridional flows into the radiative zone are much less stringent than previously claimed .",
    "the exact flow velocities and depth of penetration achieved , however , depend sensitively on the actual boundary conditions selected .",
    "these results and conclusions are discussed in detail in  [ sec : ccl ] .",
    "in all that follows we consider a stably stratified radiative zone located beneath a turbulent convection zone , a typical situation encountered in all solar - type stars . within the convection zone , we assume that turbulent stresses drive large - scale flows in the azimuthal direction ( i.e. a large - scale differential rotation ) as well as in the meridional direction . the amplitude and spatial variation of the flows just above the convective - radiative interface",
    "is assumed to be known .",
    "we then pose and solve the following question : _ what is the resulting flow pattern and velocities in the underlying radiative zone ? _",
    "the spherical geometry of the solar radiative zone as well as the non - uniform background state ( in terms of temperature and density , viscosity and thermal conductivity for instance ) both preclude any attempt at solving the problem analytically .",
    "we postpone to  [ sec : num ] the presentation and discussion of the complete numerical solution of the problem , and first consider a much simplified `` radiative zone '' with rectangular geometry in cartesian coordinates @xmath1 , and a uniform background temperature gradient , viscosity and thermal conductivity . in this coordinate system , the @xmath2-direction can be thought of as the azimuthal direction with @xmath3 $ ] , the @xmath4-direction is aligned with the latitudinal direction and is limited to @xmath5 $ ] and finally the @xmath6-direction is the radial direction with @xmath7 .",
    "the poles are represented by @xmath8 and @xmath9 while the equator is at @xmath10 .",
    "the dimensional constant @xmath11 represents the base of the convection zone , and @xmath12 the interior of the sun .",
    "the system rotates with angular velocity @xmath13 , and gravity is assumed to be aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "the equations governing dynamical and thermal perturbations to a stably stratified background assumed at rest are the mass , momentum and thermal energy conservation equations . using the boussinesq approximation and assuming `` axial '' symmetry ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , we first linearize these equations in the thermal perturbations and flow velocities , then project them onto the cartesian coordinate system as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the flow velocity , @xmath17 is the temperature perturbation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the viscosity and thermal diffusivity , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the background temperature and",
    "finally , @xmath22 is the background buoyancy frequency .",
    "note that the viscous diffusion term in the radial component of the momentum equation has been neglected in accordance with hydrostatic equilibrium ; this does not affect in any way the conclusions of this paper .    while gm04 and mcintyre ( 2007 ) neglected the @xmath23 terms in the viscous terms , we consider here for completeness the full laplacian .",
    "the additional terms are found to be necessary in the light of the fact that some of the boundary layers in the system are large compared with the vertical size of the domain .",
    "neglecting these terms is not physically justified , and mathematically transforms any slowly varying , standard exponential solutions into the rather unphysical secular linear solutions described by mcintyre ( 2007 ) ( and neglected by gm04 ) .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium equation can be combined with the latitudinal component of the momentum equation to yield a generalized thermal - wind equation , @xmath24    seeking solutions with latitudinal dependence as @xmath25 or @xmath26 , and exponential vertical dependence as @xmath27 , we obtain the characteristic equation @xmath28    = 0 \\mbox {    ,    }   \\label{eq : caract1}\\ ] ] where we have introduced two standard characteristic lengthscales @xmath29 the first one being the standard ekman depth and the second representing a buoyancy - diffusion layer ( gm04 , barcildon & pedlosky 1967 ) .",
    "it is possible to show ( with some algebra ) that in the limit where @xmath30 ( which is always true below the base of the convection zone ) then the eight solutions to equation ( [ eq : caract1 ] ) ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) can be approximated by @xmath35 thus yielding four slowly varying exponential solutions ( related to @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) in addition to four rapidly varying , oscillatory and exponential solutions related to @xmath38 and @xmath39 which describe the ekman layers of the system .",
    "the ekman solutions were found and described by gm04 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 solutions differ from the ( two ) real solutions found by gm04 , a discrepancy which can easily be traced back to the omitted @xmath23 in their viscous diffusion terms .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the local density scaleheight , @xmath42 is the prandtl number and where the burger number @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 the burger number in the solar radiative zone is estimated to be about @xmath45 using @xmath46s@xmath47 , @xmath48s@xmath47 , @xmath49 cm and @xmath50 cm ( see gough , 2007 ) . in laminar regions of the solar radiative zone , the microscopic prandtl number is of order @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 which is clearly of the order of @xmath11 itself for large - scale forcing ( small @xmath53 ) .",

    "note that since the problem studied is linear , and since any of the three velocity components of @xmath73 can be written as a fourier series in @xmath54 and @xmath55 , it is possible to find the general solution of ( [ eq : maineqs ] ) for any set of imposed velocities .",
    "the profiles chosen here contain only one fourier component for simplicity .",
    "near the bottom boundary , we would in principle like to choose boundary conditions that have as little effect on the solution as possible .",

    "we have shown that there exist solutions for meridional flows in the radiative interior with significant amplitude throughout .",
    "these flows can only be present if driven by direct pumping into and out of the radiative zone , that is , when @xmath70 has a significant amplitude on the boundary .",
    "our study also shows that the actual amplitude of the flows within the radiative zone depends sensitively on the thermal boundary conditions used .",
    "while it is not clear which set of boundary conditions actually accurately represents the true convective - radiative interface , it is not implausible that they may lie somewhere in between the two extreme cases studied .",
    "thus it is also not implausible that there may be significant penetration of the convective zone flows into the radiative zone , with typical turnover times shorter than @xmath130 .",
    "our results extend the work of gm04 , and naturally recover their solutions in the limit where only latitudinal forcing is taken into account .",
    "note that gm04 do not specifically require that @xmath63 be null on the convective - radiative interface , and argue that any spatially varying latitudinal flow drives radial flows into and out of the boundary to guarantee mass conservation .",
    "this is indeed correct , but one must keep in mind that @xmath131 only relates latitudinal variations in @xmath62 to the radial derivative of @xmath63 .",
    "since the derivative is dominated at the base of the convection zone by rapid variation on the ekman scale , the mass conservation equation in fact requires that the radial flows in the gm04 solution have an amplitude of the order of @xmath132 .",
    "it is therefore easy to see why their solution yields negligible velocities for the slowly varying component of the flow penetrating into the radiative zone .",
    "finally , it is crucial to note that since the momentum and energy equations in this study ( and the preceding ones by gm04 and mcintyre , 2007 ) have been linearized , the predicted amplitudes of the flows are linearly dependent on the imposed flow velocities . in reality",
    ", this will only be true in the limit where the typical amplitudes of the nonlinear advection terms ( @xmath133 for the momentum equation , and @xmath134 for the energy equation ) are indeed much smaller than the corresponding linear terms ( @xmath135 for the momentum equation and @xmath136 for the energy equation ) .",
    "the nonlinear terms in the momentum equation for example guarantee that no unphysical counter - rotation is allowed .",
    "the linearized equations on the other hand scale arbitrarily with the imposed boundary conditions and do allow counter - rotation for certain input parameters , e.g. if the imposed differential rotation profile @xmath67 is large enough or if the meridional flows are too rapid ( see figure [ fig : nm8 ] for instance ) .",
    "similarly , the nonlinear terms in the energy equation guarantee that the actual turnover time of the meridional flows can not be lower than the local thermal diffusion time ( over the depth considered ) , while the linearized equations allow for any values of the turnover time provided the imposed boundary flow velocities are high enough .    from this linearized model",
    ", we can therefore say with reasonable confidence that meridional flows can indeed penetrate into the radiative zone , provided their turnover time ( typically estimated as @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the depth considered ) is longer than the local thermal diffusion time ( estimated as @xmath139 ) .",
    "one of the remaining issues that needs to be addressed is that of lower boundary . in the previous section ,",
    "the high - dimensionality of the solution space made it difficult to consider the more realistic situation of a bottom boundary located at @xmath12 . while the ekman solutions ( associated with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) decay inward / downward so quickly that the presence or absence of a lower boundary can not affect them , the slowly varying solutions do span the entire radiative region from @xmath140 down to @xmath12 ; the location of the lower boundary is expected to have some influence on their amplitude .    here",
    ", we therefore focus on studying the slowly varying solutions only by considering a system in which the ekman flows are filtered out .",
    "this is another way of reducing the dimensionality of the solution space , and enables us to compare the solutions in a semi - infinite domain to the solutions in a finite domain .",
    "we consider the system @xmath141 in which the viscous diffusion terms within the latitudinal component of the momentum equation has now been removed .",
    "this simplification is consistent with the assumptions of geostrophic equilibrium and , as we now prove , effectively filters out the ekman flows . the system can be reduced to a single partial differential equation for @xmath61 , for instance , as @xmath142    seeking exponential solutions in @xmath6 with periodic behavior in @xmath4 as before yields the characteristic equation : @xmath143 with solutions @xmath144 and @xmath145 with @xmath146 thus we recover only the slowly varying solutions of the previous section .",
    "the flow solution to the above system for fixed latitudinal wavenumber @xmath53 is @xmath147 which also yields @xmath148 and @xmath149      the governing equations considered form what is apparently a 6@xmath150 order system in the @xmath6 direction , and require , in principle , 6 boundary conditions split between the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "naturally , one would like to impose boundary conditions on @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath17 ( one at the top , one at the bottom for each variable ) . note that since the viscous terms have been neglected in the equations for hydrostatic and geostrophic equilibrium respectively , one can not impose a boundary condition on @xmath62 : the equations contain no stresses that could transfer the boundary information to the rest of the system .",
    "however , we see that combining these equations only yields a 4@xmath151 order partial differential equation for @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that the 6 selected boundary conditions must somehow be redundant , otherwise there will be no solution to the system . in what follows",
    ", we therefore only select boundary conditions for @xmath61 and @xmath63 at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "near the top boundary , we consider as before @xmath152 when considering a bottom boundary at @xmath12 , we choose impermeable boundary conditions for @xmath63 , and stress - free boundary conditions for @xmath61 so that @xmath153      when the bottom boundary is near @xmath154 , we find that @xmath155 so that @xmath156 which illustrates again how radial forcing can yield non - zero flow amplitudes penetrating deeply into the radiative zone .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the predicted flow amplitude is different from that found in ",
    "[ sec : cart ] . this might be attributed to the fact that when viscous effects are taken into account , a fraction of the flow penetrating into the radiative zone is deflected into the very shallow ekman layers .",
    "when the bottom boundary is located at @xmath12 , we find that @xmath157 implying @xmath158      comparing the expressions in equations ( [ eq : semiinf ] ) and ( [ eq : finite ] ) , we find that the slowly varying component of the meridional flow in the case of a finite domain has an amplitude that is @xmath159 times that of the semi - infinite domain case .",
    "the difference between the predicted amplitudes for the two geometrical systems ( finite and semi - infinite domains ) can easily be understood in the light of the fact that the exponential solutions associated with @xmath160 and @xmath161 decay on much longer lengthscales than @xmath11 .    extrapolating this result to the full cartesian problem studied in  [ sec : cart ] , we therefore predict that the slowly varying components of the meridional flows ( associated with the @xmath36 and @xmath37 wavenumbers ) should in fact have an amplitude that is @xmath162 times that given in ( [ eq : vcase1 ] ) and ( [ eq : vcase2 ] ) ; the ekman components on the other hand decay so rapidly that their amplitude should not be influenced by the presence of a lower boundary .",
    "we now revise our estimates of  [ subsec : case1 ] and  [ subsec : case2 ] to predict that in the case of type 1 boundary conditions ( @xmath163 at the upper boundary ) then    * azimuthal forcing leads to meridional flows with a rapidly decaying component with an amplitude proportional to @xmath164 , while the slowly decaying component has an amplitude proportional to @xmath165 .",

    "to complete this axisymmetric study and illustrate our analytical results numerically , we perform simulations of flows in the solar radiative zone subject to various boundary conditions . the governing equations for the numerical model are derived by perturbing the spherically symmetric equations of stellar structure , moving to a rotating frame of reference and assuming that the velocity perturbations and thermodynamical perturbations to the background spherically symmetric state are small enough for linearization to be appropriate .",

    "the origin of this discrepancy is not entirely clear , but can be partly traced back to non - ideal effects in the equation of state ( which affects the determination of @xmath242 ) and to geometrical effects ( which influence the value of @xmath37 ) .    in order to compare the scalings of the slowly decaying component of the flow with the numerical results",

    "the information about the direction of the flow ( poleward or equatorward ) is lost in this plot , with sign reversals appearing as cusps in the curves pointing towards @xmath154 .",
    "note that it is possible to discern the presence of the ekman layer close to the outer boundary for the larger values of @xmath181 .",
    "a quick glance at the solutions in the deep radiative interior reveals the behavior suggested by the cartesian solutions : different assumptions concerning the boundary conditions yield very different predicted flow velocities .",
    "in particular , it can be seen that in the case of radial forcing with type 2 boundary conditions ( i.e. @xmath194 ) the flows velocities are more - or - less independent of @xmath181 , or in other words retain significant amplitudes for any value of the background viscosity .",
    "more quantitatively , from the conclusions of  [ subsec : cons ] , we expect the amplitude of the slowly decaying solution to scale as @xmath244 in the case of azimuthal and latitudinal forcing , to scale as @xmath231 for radial forcing with @xmath221 and as @xmath245 in the case of radial forcing with the type 2 temperature boundary conditions .",
    "the comparison between the predicted scalings and the outcome of the numerical simulations is shown in figure [ fig : slowscale ] , using the same method as described earlier in the case of the rapidly decaying component of the solution .",
    "we can see that , as before , the predicted amplitudes agree very well with the numerical solutions , except perhaps in the case of radial forcing with type 2 boundary conditions where a small discrepancy remains .    we therefore conclude that despite the simplified nature of the analytical analysis performed in ",
    "[ sec : cart ] and  [ sec : toy ] , the results obtained robustly predict the scalings of the numerical solutions in full spherical geometry .",
    "finally , in order to provide better insight into the actual solutions , we show in figure [ fig : nm8 ] the global structure of the numerical results . in the left - hand - side of figure [ fig : nm8 ] , we show results for the solar value of the prandtl number ( and therefore solar values of @xmath37 near the convective - radiative interface ) , while in the right - hand - side we show results for a quarter - times solar value of the prandtl number .",
    "all the plots were generated for a fixed value of @xmath246 ( and therefore @xmath229-times solar values of the viscosity corresponding to @xmath184-times solar values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "the left quadrants show contour - lines of the stream - function , or in other words , streamlines of the flow while the right quadrants show the angular velocity profile .",
    "the four aforementioned boundary conditions are explored : azimuthal forcing only , latitudinal forcing only , radial forcing only with type 1 boundary conditions ( @xmath221 ) and radial forcing only with type 2 boundary conditions ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "these numerical results illustrate graphically the behavior predicted by the cartesian model .",
    "for example , the streamlines plotted all correspond to the same contours of the streamfunction , or in other words the same mass flux .",
    "it is therefore obvious that the flows driven through latitudinal forcing are negligible compared with the three other cases .",
    "the flows driven by azimuthal forcing appear to be quite strong , although this is merely related to the fact that the linear velocity @xmath97 corresponding to the imposed ( solar ) differential rotation is more than two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath98 at the same latitudes .",
    "the flows driven by radial forcing are quite strong , in particular given that the driving velocity @xmath99 is at least one order of magnitude lower than @xmath98 at the same latitude .",
    "one can also readily see that the flow velocities predicted using type 2 thermal boundary conditions are much stronger than in the case of type 1 thermal boundary conditions .",
    "the right - side quadrants reveal the effect of these meridional flows on angular momentum transport in the interior and show the angular velocity profile corresponding to the ultimate steady - state achieved in the radiative interior should the sun be left to evolve for many flow turnover times under the same applied boundary conditions . since the turnover time can be considerably longer than the age of the sun in most cases , these steady states",
    "would never in practise be achieved .",
    "however , they do reveal two points of particular interest .",
    "firstly , they illustrate how sensitive the interior rotation rate is to the assumed or calculated flow structure , and therefore also to the assumed convective - radiative interfacial boundary conditions .",
    "secondly , they reveal the possibility of unphysical counter - rotation permitted by the linearization of the problem ( see  [ subsec : cons ] for a discussion of this effect ) .",
    "this should be taken as a cautionary warning for any linear study of flows and thermal perturbations in the solar radiative interior to always perform a self - consistency check of the validity of the linearization .",
    "we have studied the penetration of global - scale meridional flows generated in the solar convection zone into the radiative zone below .    we have attacked the problem via a cartesian model , as others have done before us , and then verified our results with more complete numerical modeling in the correct geometry .",
    "we have extended previous work done by gm04 and mcintyre ( 2007 ) by taking into account the full structure of the governing equations and by examining the effect of boundary conditions on the solutions , or in other words , allowing a greater range of convective flows to act as sources for the flows in the radiative interior .    within a linear formalism , we confirm that the flow pattern in the radiative interior is a linear combination of two types of solutions : @xmath247 a solution that decays away from the convective - radiative interface on a short length - scale related to the ekman depth , and @xmath248 a solution that decays away from the interface on a much longer length - scale associated with the stratification of the radiative interior .",
    "our more complete treatment of the problem provides accurate expressions for the slowly varying solution .",
    "in addition , we find that the _ amplitudes _ of the rapidly and slowly varying solutions depend sensitively on the choice of dynamical and thermal interfacial forcing .    forcing by azimuthal and latitudinal shear at the upper boundary lead to both rapidly varying and slowly varying solutions , but with amplitudes that are negligible outside a few ekman lengths . forcing by direct radial pumping however can generate flows which are significant outside the ekman boundary layer and indeed are sufficiently slowly - varying that they may maintain significant flow amplitudes across the whole depth of the radiative zone .",
    "the selected thermal boundary conditions at the convective - radiative interface are also found to have significant impact on the interior solution .    in this linear problem , full solutions can be built from combinations of the individual solutions obtained for each different type of boundary forcing that we studied .",
    "thus in principle we should be able to determine the complete flow structure within the radiative interior .",
    "however , the problem lies in the selection of the interfacial conditions .",
    "we know from helioseismology the amplitude of the average azimuthal flows existing near the base of the convection zone , but know very little of the nature of the meridional flows or of the thermal conditions at that interface .",
    "thus , without a complete model of the whole solar interior which includes the turbulent solar convection zone we can only speculate upon the thermal and dynamical nature of the convective - radiative interface . instead , when studying a broad range of _ plausible _ boundary conditions we find that significant penetration depths can be realized .",
    "previous work by gm04 focused on the effects of a latitudinal source flow only .",
    "our result is in accordance with theirs for this particular type of boundary condition , namely that the flows within the radiative interior are limited to an ekman depth .",
    "however , gm04 conclude that penetration is _ always _ quenched . given our analytical and numerical results in the case of other applied boundary conditions , we feel that this conclusion is too strong .",
    "other plausible models of the interface lead to different results concerning the flow amplitudes within the interior . without better knowledge of the conditions at the convective - radiative interface",
    ", it is hard to predict precisely what does happen .",
    "while realistic three - dimensional global models of the solar interior combining radiative and convective regions are not yet numerically achievable , turbulent closure models have been applied to model both azimuthal and meridional flows in most of the solar interior ( kitchatinov & ruediger , 2005 ; rempel , 2005 ) .",
    "using such a model , ruediger , kitchatinov & arlt ( 2005 ) studied the penetration of meridional flows into the tachocline . by defining the penetration depth @xmath249 as _ the distance from the base of the convection zone to the location of the first reversal in @xmath225",
    "_ , they find that @xmath250 and conclude by agreeing with gm04 that the depth of penetration of the flows in the interior is indeed limited to the ekman solution",
    ". however , it is clear from our analysis that @xmath249 as defined by ruediger , kitchatinov & arlt only measures the variation of the rapidly decaying solution ( which indeed must vary on an ekman length ) .",
    "for example , inspection of figure [ fig : rapidsol ] shows that at a first glance , all of the solutions appear to behave as ekman solutions , while it is only by looking more closely at the flows deep in the interior ( in figure [ fig : slowsol ] ) that one can identify the presence of the slowly decaying solution with a relatively low but nonetheless significant amplitude .",
    "we suggest that the predictions of the closure models for flow velocities in the interior could be revisited in the light of our analysis .",
    "finally , the governing equations in this work have been simplified using two major approximations , which must now be briefly addressed .",
    "firstly , this study is assumes the flows to be in a quasi - steady state .",
    "as it was shown by mcintyre ( 2007 ) this assumption filters out any transient flows , which could in some circumstances be of much larger amplitude than these steady - state flows ( see spiegel & zahn , 1992 for example ) .",
    "therefore our conclusions are likely to underestimate the actual turnover time of transient meridional flows .",
    "secondly , the momentum and thermal energy equation have been linearized with the consequences described in ",
    "[ subsec : disc ] , an example of which ( the unphysical counter - rotation ) is shown in figure [ fig : nm8 ] .",
    "we do emphasize that in the real sun nonlinear effects would play a role in limiting the amplitude of the meridional and azimuthal flows penetrating into the radiative zone .",
    "therefore our results are consistent with the standard theory that no flows with turnover times faster than the thermal diffusion time are allowed into the radiative zone .",
    "this limits the flow turnover time in the tachocline region to a few times @xmath251 years , and into the deep interior to a few times @xmath191 years .",
    "neither of these caveats , however , change the main conclusion of our analysis , which is that the penetration of meridional flows into the radiative interior is not necessarily limited to a shallow ekman depth .",
