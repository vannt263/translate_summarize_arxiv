    "decades have passed since quantum chromodynamics was accepted as the theory of strong interaction . while the successes of this theory are impressive , there still remain numerous unresolved problems .",
    "the most prominent of those problems is the confinement . at low energy ,",
    "we observe hadrons instead of the qcd fundamental degrees of freedom and we still do not quite understand the mechanism of this phenomenon .",
    "the lack of the understanding is mainly due to the strongly coupled nature of the theory at low energy and to the fact that we do not have very good analytical control over the field theory in such coupling regime .",
    "the best hope , therefore , is that the numerical study could provide important insights into qcd at strong coupling .",
    "confinement is one of the phases of qcd and there are other phases in different regions of the qcd parameter space .",
    "one such example is the deconfined phase at high temperature . the numerical method , in fact ,",
    "is proven to be powerful in the investigation of the confinement / deconfinement phase transition , and has provided the estimates of the transition temperature and the order of the phase transition .",
    "( see reference  @xcite and the papers cited therein .",
    ") there is , however , a large region of the parameter space in which even the numerical study has not been very successful .",
    "namely , the theory at finite quark ( baryon ) density .",
    "there is a problem in carrying out lattice simulations with the nonzero chemical potentials that are conjugate to the density and this is known as the sign problem ( see _ e.g. _ reference  @xcite ) .",
    "while the effort to overcome the sign problem vigorously continues , there have been some developments in analytic approaches .",
    "these include the analysis at asymptotically large chemical potential and also the use of njl type models .",
    "the former takes the advantage that the qcd coupling is expected to be weak at very high density and perturbative computations from the qcd lagrangian itself are possible .",
    "the latter models are pure fermionic and quartic couplings , which reproduce properties of qcd interactions in a certain degree , are introduced .    what has been emerging from these analyses is the very rich phase structure of qcd in the parameter space of the temperature and the chemical potential .",
    "( see , for example , reference  @xcite for the phase diagram . ) in general , a cold and highly dense quark matter is expected to become a color superconductor @xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "when the quark chemical potential @xmath2 is very large , the coupling @xmath3 is small and the excitations near the fermi surface of the quarks , particles and holes , are nearly free , and this naive ground state at high density is known as the fermi liquid .",
    "however , the pairs of the particles at the antipodal points of the fermi sphere are all degenerate and it costs no free energy to form such a pair . then ,",
    "if there is an attractive force between the particles ( or holes ) , the pairing actually reduces the free energy of the system , leading to the instability of the naive ground state against the formation of the pair ( cooper pair ) .",
    "this is known as the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) instability @xcite and in their original work for the electron gas in a solid , the attractive force was provided by the phonon exchange . for the case of high density qcd , there is an attractive force in a color channel and it leads to the similar bcs instability .    in particular , if we have three massless flavors in the theory , a very interesting form of the condensate has been found to form @xcite .",
    "massless quarks is an approximate qcd where the masses of @xmath4 are set to zero and those of @xmath5 are taken to infinity . ]",
    "this is the ( scalar ) diquark condensate of the form @xmath6 where the superscripts @xmath7 are the color indices , the subscripts @xmath8 are for the flavors , the subscripts @xmath9 indicates the chirality of the quarks and @xmath10 is the size of the condensate ( the gap ) .",
    "as one can see , the kronecker deltas relate the flavor and color symmetries and those are not separately preserved by the condensate .",
    "the residual symmetry is the simultaneous flavor and ( global ) color rotations and for this reason , this phenomenon is called the color - flavor locking ( cfl ) .",
    "the full symmetry breaking pattern of cfl is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the global diagonal subgroup of the original color and flavor symmetries , @xmath13 is the subgroup of @xmath14 that changes the sign of all the quarks and @xmath15 is known as the `` modified electromagnetism '' whose gauge boson is a linear combination of the original photon and one of the gluons @xcite .",
    "we observe that since @xmath16- and @xmath17-flavor symmetries both lock to the color , the chiral symmetry is broken through the color factor . even though the mechanism of the chiral symmetry breaking is very unusual ,",
    "the corresponding chiral lagrangian can be built @xcite .",
    "this novel phase of qcd created a renewed and wide interest in the qcd phase structure and many generalizations and modifications have been explored .",
    "for example , when one considers finite quark masses , there are other possible forms of the condensate and those can be energetically favored for some regions of the @xmath2-t parameter space , resulting in the complicated structure of the phase diagram .",
    "the interested reader can pursuit the subject in the review papers cited above .    rather than continuing to overview the qcd phase structure",
    ", we would now like to turn to the high density behavior in the t hooft limit with weak coupling .",
    "( this is not qcd , which has @xmath18 , but has a potential relation to the holographic theories . ) in this case , we do not expect the color superconductor to be the correct ground state of the cold qcd .",
    "heuristically , this is because the cooper pair is not a color singlet and not expected to survive the limit .",
    "the possibility of a color singlet condensate of particle and hole ( not anti - particle ) has been investigated by deryagin , grigoriev and rubakov ( dgr ) in reference  @xcite . when the particle and hole at the antipodal points of the fermi sphere form a pair , the condensate is not homogeneous nor isotropic but is a standing wave in a certain direction ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a function that describes the amplitude of the standing wave .",
    "the condensate is called the chiral density wave ( @xmath22dw ) and it breaks the chiral symmetry but not the gauge symmetry ( in the limit @xmath23 ) .",
    "this condensate is kinematically less favored than the cooper pairing at @xmath0 , but it has been shown that the ground state instability due to the formation of @xmath22dw ( dgr instability ) dominates over the bcs - type instability in the large @xmath24 limit @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine the high density behavior of the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite . as we will describe in section",
    "[ sec : weakcoupling ] , this is a model in type iia string theory with a certain brane configuration .",
    "what makes this model interesting is that the low energy spectrum is similar to that of qcd , especially , there are fundamental quarks with the left- and right - chiral symmetries . in the strong coupling gravity background analysis , sakai and sugimoto",
    "have shown that the chiral symmetry is broken and they were able to compute the hadron spectrum of the theory .",
    "moreover , they have constructed the low energy effective action of the theory with the skyrme term whose soliton excitations can be considered as baryons . those promising successes make this model an interesting candidate for holographic qcd .",
    "therefore , we are naturally motivated to examine the model at high density and ultimately , we hope the model to give insight into the structure of the qcd phase diagram in all values of the parameters , especially in the medium density region where the theory is strongly coupled .",
    "though we do not get this far in this work , we show in section  [ sec : weakcoupling ] that the weak coupling regime of the theory at high density and zero temperature behaves very similar to qcd with a few differences .",
    "one of the differences is that when the chemical potential is very large with respect to the compactification size of the model , the bcs and dgr instabilities at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , are absent and the ground state is the fermi liquid . in section  [ sec : discussions ] , we comment on the known finite density analysis of the model at strong coupling , contrasting to the qcd expectations . in the strong coupling analysis , the possibilities of the superconductivity and @xmath22dw have not been addressed and we discuss some prospects in this direction .",
    "in this section , we discuss the sakai - sugimoto brane system at high density with the weak yang - mills coupling of the world - volume theory . though the results are relatively straightforward , the computations are somewhat involved .",
    "we therefore split the discussion into the qualitative and quantitative parts . in the first part",
    ", we qualitatively explain the high density behavior of the system , then in the second part , we carry out the computations and confirm the qualitative expectations .",
    "let us briefly review the bcs and dgr instabilities of high density qcd in a way that would provide the conceptual background for the quantitative calculations . for simplicity , we set all current quark masses to zero , which is a good approximation when the quark chemical potential is much larger than the mass of the heaviest quark . in the presence of the quark chemical potential , @xmath2 , at zero temperature",
    ", we have a well - defined fermi sphere of radius @xmath2 . as a convention",
    ", we take the excitations near the fermi surface be particles as opposed to anti - particles .",
    "when @xmath2 is very large , the anti - particles are buried deep in the dirac sea and will not play a role in the following discussion .    on the fermi surface ,",
    "the free energy of the states are zero ( more precisely , at the minimum ) and it costs no free energy to change momentum along the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , the energy scales only in the radial direction of the sphere and we consider the renormalization group flow as we scale the energy down toward the fermi surface",
    ". the relevant degrees of freedom are the particles and holes near the fermi surface and we are interested in the effective theory that describes the dynamics of those excitations .",
    "let us specify a point on the fermi surface by the momentum @xmath25 with the magnitude @xmath20 and decompose a four - momentum near this point as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is parallel to @xmath25 and @xmath28 is perpendicular to it .",
    "as stated before , only @xmath29 scales with energy and @xmath30 may be trivially integrated along the fermi surface in a diagram computation .",
    "we , therefore , have the @xmath31-dimensional effective theory that describes the dynamics of the particles and holes .",
    "it is important to notice that the kinematics is restricted because the dynamics must take place near the fermi surface .",
    "when we consider a particle - particle or hole - hole scattering , it is clear that the scattering must be near back - to - back , that is , the scattering pairs must be at antipodal points of the fermi sphere . in the back - to - back scattering , the scattering angle may be arbitrary without spoiling the kinematic restriction and hence the phase space of this scattering is all over the fermi surface .",
    "now in a two - dimensional theory , irrelevant operators of four dimensions may become relevant or marginal .",
    "in particular , a four - fermion interaction is marginal in two dimensions .",
    "if the interaction is attractive , the quartic coupling grows as we scale the energy down toward the fermi surface and it eventually hits the landau pole .",
    "this implies that the perturbation theory breaks down at the infrared scale around the pole . for the scattering of particle or hole",
    "pairs , this indicates that the naive ground state of the weakly interacting particles and holes near the fermi surface , the fermi liquid , is unstable against the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "this is the bcs instability , and the new ground state has a gap due to the formation of the condensate whose size is roughly the location of the landau pole .",
    "technically , as we will see in the next subsection , the instability is closely related to the infrared divergence that appear in the perturbation theory and the gap properly provides the infrared cutoff . in weakly coupled qcd , _",
    "i.e. _ , qcd at very high density , the leading order contribution to the interaction is given by the one - gluon exchange and it is attractive in the antisymmetric @xmath32-channel , resulting in the color superconductivity .",
    "+ we now turn to the dgr instability .",
    "this is associated with the scattering of the particle and hole located at the antipodal points of the fermi sphere . in this case",
    ", the scattering is not back - to - back , but near forward . unlike the back - to - back case",
    ", the scattering angle can not be too large to stay near the fermi surface and the phase space of the forward scattering is limited to a very tiny patch on the fermi surface .",
    "the difference in the phase spaces for the bcs and dgr cases will be important in the quantitative computations .",
    "now the particle - hole forward scattering is similar to the bhabha scattering whose amplitude has the forward enhancement .",
    "thus also in our case , we can expect an infrared divergence ( the dgr instability ) as the exchange gluon becomes very soft , leading to a condensate of the particle - hole pair ( @xmath22dw ) .",
    "this , however , does not happen in weakly coupled qcd .",
    "the reason is that the finite density screening effect completely overwhelms such a condensate ; it is the screening that provides the infrared cutoff and not the formation of a condensate .",
    "the situation is different in the large @xmath24 limit ( with small t hooft coupling ) .",
    "first , note that the cooper pair of the bcs instability is not color singlet while the @xmath22dw of dgr is .",
    "therefore , the bcs instability is @xmath33 suppressed and dgr is not .",
    "secondly , since only the quarks are charged under the @xmath14-symmetry , the finite density screening effect is provided by the quark loops , such as the one shown in figure  [ fig : quarkloop ] , and the gluon loops do not contribute because the gluon propagator is independent of the quark chemical potential .",
    "this implies that the finite density screening is suppressed as the number of the color is taken to a large value .",
    "in fact , the dgr instability was discovered by disregarding the the screening effect and the authors of reference  @xcite noted that the @xmath22dw can form and dominate over the cooper pairing at least in the large @xmath24 limit .",
    "later , shuster and son showed that the dgr instability may occur if @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of the flavor @xcite .",
    "this is an example where the large @xmath24 limit of qcd yields qualitatively different properties . in weakly coupled qcd",
    ", @xmath22dw is not a relevant phenomenon . though it could possibly compete with the cooper pair at strong coupling ,",
    "so far the situation is unclear @xcite .",
    "we now consider whether the sakai - sugimoto model at high density exhibits similar properties as discussed above .",
    "for this purpose , we assume that the model is in the regime with low energy and weak yang - mills coupling so that we can use the perturbative world - volume field theory arguments .    the model is type iia string theory with d4- , d8- and @xmath36-branes .",
    "the configuration of the branes is shown in figure  [ fig : branesetup ] .",
    "the @xmath37-direction is compactified to the circle of circumference @xmath16 and the d8@xmath36-branes are placed at the antipodal points of the circle . to discuss the low energy spectrum of the model , we first consider only the compactified @xmath24 d4-branes . in reference",
    "@xcite , witten suggested that if we impose the anti - periodic boundary condition to the adjoint world - volume fermions , the low energy world - volume theory has the spectrum of @xmath38-dimensional pure yang - mills theory .",
    "this is because the fermions get tree level mass of order @xmath39 and the scalars , including the compactified component of gauge field , @xmath40 , get the one - loop mass of order @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 string coupling and @xmath45 string length scale , and we assume @xmath46 .",
    ", in all orders of the perturbation theory . ]",
    "now , sakai and sugimoto insert the @xmath35 d8 and @xmath35 @xmath36 branes as shown . as explained in reference",
    "@xcite , there are massless fermions at the @xmath38-dimensional intersection of d4- and d8-branes .",
    "these are the lowest states of the strings stretching from d8 to d4 .",
    "since the world - volume @xmath47 gauge symmetry of d8-branes acts as the flavor symmetry , these massless fermions are fundamental `` quarks '' .",
    "similar massless fermions are also present at the intersection of d4- and @xmath36-branes . however , the gso projection projects out opposite chiralities to those fermions at different intersections .",
    "therefore , we call the massless fermions at d4d8 and d4@xmath36 intersections as `` left - handed ( @xmath48 ) and right - handed ( @xmath49 ) quarks '' , respectively .    this theory at low energy , therefore , has @xmath50 flavor symmetry and the theory appears to be very similar to the massless qcd , if @xmath24 and @xmath35 are appropriately chosen .",
    "the difference , of course , is that the fermions with different chiralities are separately located in the @xmath37-direction and the gluons propagate in five dimensions , including the @xmath37-direction . as argued by antonyan _",
    "@xcite , this qcd - like dynamics of the quarks at the intersections does not change even if the period @xmath16 is large ; the shift symmetry of the d4 adjoint scalars and the five dimensional gauge symmetry allow the scalars , including @xmath40 , to couple to the fundamental fermions only through derivative interactins which is suppressed by the string scale .    in the weak coupling analysis that we carry out in this section , we assume that the period @xmath16 is much larger than the string length scale @xmath45 so that the tachyon becomes heavy and decouples .",
    "also as we have already explained , we place the d8 and @xmath36 branes at the antipodal points of the compactified circle . + in examining this model , we need to decide on how the quarks interact through the exchange of the gluons that propagate in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "one possibility is the non - local interaction .",
    "this scenario takes only into account of the zero - mode of the discrete momentum in the @xmath37-direction . in this case",
    ", the theory becomes completely insensitive to the existence of the fifth dimension and behaves in the same way as the four dimensional qcd - like theory .",
    "we find this non - local scenario less appealing , especially when the compactification scale @xmath16 is large .",
    "we thus take the second alternative where the d8-branes are treated as sources ( or stiff walls ) and allow the exchanged gluons to carry arbitrarily high momenta in the @xmath37-direction .- momentum to infinity . ]",
    "such an assumption is reasonable because the d8 branes are infinitely heavier than the d4s and consistent with the fact that we are treating the d8s as the flavor branes , that is , we are neglecting their fluctuations .",
    "the momentum is not conserved in the @xmath37-direction but this is natural in that the translation symmetry is broken in this direction .",
    "we now explain how we introduce the quark chemical potential .",
    "we have the global symmetry @xmath51 .",
    "the chemical potential that we are interested in is conjugate to the @xmath14 charge .",
    "the standard way to introduce a chemical potential in a field theory is to treat it as the constant background `` gauged '' field of a @xmath52 global symmetry , with all the components being zero except the time component . in this way",
    ", the chemical potential modifies the time component of the covariant derivatives in the lagrangian of the theory .",
    "thus in our case , the simplest way to introduce the quark chemical potential is to turn on the @xmath53 constant background gauge fields of @xmath54 and @xmath55 world - volume gauge symmetries and tune them to an equal value .",
    "actually , the background fields may not be constant all over the d8-branes and the only requirement is to have the constant value at the intersections with the d4-branes .",
    "thus , for example , we may turn on the field that depends on the radial direction in the 5,6,7,8 and 9 directions which would correspond to the nonzero electric field in the world - volume .",
    "+ what we will find in the quantitative analysis of the next section is rather intuitive .",
    "as we have mentioned , if we consider the effect only of the zero - mode momentum in the @xmath37-direction , the theory reduces to the qcd - like theory .",
    "thus when the compactification scale @xmath39 is very large compared to the energy scale of the interest , in this case it is the value of the chemical potential @xmath2 , we expect to have the bcs and dgr instabilities at @xmath0 and at @xmath1 , respectively , just as described before .",
    "now as the compactification scale @xmath39 gets smaller , the infrared effect in the @xmath37-direction becomes comparable to the one that leads to the regular bcs or dgr instability . as a consequence ,",
    "the size of the condensate grows and eventually becomes too large to maintain the dynamics near the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , when the scale @xmath39 is small with respect to @xmath2 , there is no bcs or dgr type of instability and the ground state of the theory is described by the fermi liquid .    in this qualitative discussion , it is not clear at what scale this crossover occurs .",
    "the computations of the next subsection show that at @xmath0 and @xmath56 , no bcs - type instability is present and at @xmath1 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 , no dgr - type instability happens .",
    "notice that the dgr instability persists to exponentially larger value of @xmath59 compared to the bcs case .",
    "this is because the phase space of the particle - hole scattering is very small , in fact it is exponentially small , and the discrete momentum in the compactified direction must become as fine as this scale to open up the extra dimension .",
    "the situation explained here is _ schematically _ summarized in figure  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we now demonstrate quantitatively what has been discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "we carry out the renormalization group and dyson - schwinger analyses .",
    "the former is more intuitive in accordance with the qualitative discussion and shows the existence of the instabilities . but this method does not provide the size of the gap and this is augmented by solving the dyson - schwinger equations .    we adopt the conventions of wess and bagger  @xcite , except the definition of the dirac spinor ; @xmath60 we mainly work in the chiral basis . as a convention , the undotted and dotted spinors live on the d8 and @xmath36 branes , respectively .",
    "our central focus of this subsection is to show the existence of the instabilities and to obtain the size of the gap .",
    "we are less interested in the exact color - flavor structure of the condensate , so in what follows , we simplify the analysis by suppressing the flavor structure .",
    "this is similar to @xmath61 case where the pauli principle requires the simpler quark pairing .",
    "our first analysis is macroscopic in a sense that we introduce an effective one point four - fermion coupling .",
    "then we observe how the effective coupling evolves as we scale the energy of the system down to the fermi surface .",
    "this idea was first carried out in high density qcd by evans _",
    "_ in reference  @xcite .",
    "since we are dealing with the weak coupling at high density , the quark interaction can be approximated by a single gluon exchange .",
    "we then model the four - fermion interaction by replacing the one - gluon exchange to a point , as shown in figure  [ fig : onepoint ] .    because the chemical potential breaks the @xmath38 world - volume symmetry down to @xmath62",
    ", we separately handle the couplings , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as in @xmath65 for the one - gluon exchange , we can further write @xmath66 notice that we have included the minus sign from the signature in the definition of @xmath63 .",
    "the constant @xmath67 is the five dimensional yang - mills coupling as before , @xmath68 is the form factor that arises from the gluon propagator and @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the casimir operator of @xmath71 in the representation @xmath72 and @xmath73 being the defining representation .",
    "we consider three color channels ; symmetric ( symm ) , antisymmetric ( asymm ) and singlet ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "for those cases , we have @xmath75 where we have adopted the normalization @xmath76 for the @xmath77 matrices @xmath78 of the defining representation .",
    "notice the large @xmath24 behavior of those factors .",
    "the singlet channel is larger than the other channels by a factor of @xmath24 in the absolute value .",
    "this can be easily understood in the double line notation of the single gluon exchange diagrams , as shown in figure  [ fig : doubleline ] .",
    "let us now consider the form factor , @xmath68 .",
    "the gluon propagator in the feynman gauge has the form @xmath79 with the discrete momentum , @xmath80 , in the compactified direction and this propagator suffers from an infrared divergence .",
    "to cure this problem , we introduce an infrared cutoff @xmath81 .",
    "we simplify the situation by assuming that @xmath81 is the same for the time and spatial components of the gluons .",
    "provides the infrared cutoff .",
    "this is true for the time component but not for the spatial components .",
    "there is no static screening in the spatial ( magnetic ) components and the magnetic screening is dynamical due to the landau damping .",
    "this was pointed out by son  @xcite and he discovered that the dynamical screening effect leads to the qualitatively different form of the gap .",
    "we will take into account of son s effect in the dyson - schwinger analysis .",
    "] possible one - gluon interactions are illustrated in figure  [ fig : interbrane ] .    in both cases shown in the figure ,",
    "the discrete momentum is @xmath82 because this is determined by the period of the compactification and not by the distance between the branes .",
    "therefore , the form factor , that arises from the gluon propagator , is independent of the d8 brane distance and is the same for the both interactions in figure  [ fig : interbrane ] ( including the case with the gluons making many rounds in the compactified circle ) .",

    "let @xmath83 and @xmath84 be the incoming and outgoing momenta of a scattering quark .",

    ", the angle should not take very large value so that the dynamics takes place near the fermi surface .",
    "thus we require , in this case , the angle range from @xmath87 to @xmath92 , where the latter angle is much less than @xmath88 and limits the phase space to a little patch on the fermi surface .",

    "this fact will lead to the dominance of the bcs - type instability over the dgr type for @xmath0 . when the dimensionless parameter @xmath97 is small , the form factors behave logarithmically with respect to the parameter @xmath98 and they behave linearly when @xmath97 is large .",
    "this is because when the the compactified dimension is very small , the contributions from @xmath99 is also small and the integral is effectively two dimensional , leading to the log behavior .",
    "when the compactification size is very large , the discrete momentum becomes finer and the integral essentially becomes three dimensional and the form factors behave linearly .",

    "_ @xcite ( but with different form factors ) .",

    "therefore in the loop , the top left - handed quark propagator carries the momentum @xmath123 and the bottom right - handed one carries @xmath124 in the directions of the arrows in the quark loop .",
    "then the propagator part of the diagram corresponding to ( [ eq : daproppart ] ) of the diagram ( a ) is @xmath125 this structure is the same as the @xmath126-case ( a ) , except the overall sign .",
    "this sign is cancelled by the other one that comes from the difference in the direction of the quark line .",
    "thus , apart from the integration range of the scattering angle @xmath86 , the cases ( a ) and ( c ) are the same .",
    "so we have for diagram ( c ) , @xmath127    now for the generic form of the renormalization group equation @xmath128 with some constant @xmath129 , the landau pole , if exists , is reached at @xmath130 since the range of @xmath114 is @xmath115 , the landau pole exists only when @xmath131 is positive and the larger the factor @xmath131 is , the faster the pole is reached .",
    "we note that because of the constants @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the form factors ( [ eq : fbb ] ) and ( [ eq : ffw ] ) , the landau pole is independent of those . from equations ( [ eqn : defng ] ) and ( [ eqn : colorfactors ] ) , and also with the fact that @xmath96 , we see that the instability is dominated by the bcs type in the @xmath126 , color antisymmetric channel for @xmath0 . note that the color symmetric channel does not have instability because the interaction in this channel is repulsive .",
    "when @xmath24 is sufficiently large , the @xmath134-channel , whose coupling is proportional to the product of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , dominates over the other channels because the inequality @xmath96 is compensated by the fact that @xmath137 .",
    "thus the dgr - type instability dominates over bcs in this regime . in our method here , it is not possible to estimate the value of @xmath24 at which the crossover from the bcs- to dgr - type instability occurs , because we crudely introduced the common infrared cutoff , @xmath81 , to all the components of the gluon propagator and we do not have the actual value of @xmath92 . see shuster and son @xcite for the estimate of the value @xmath24 .",
    "recall that the form factors grow linearly when the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 are large and the effective four - fermion couplings become large accordingly .",

    "i.e. _ , the analysis with the fundamental interactions , to gain insight into the nature of the pathology . this is the subject of the next analysis .",
    "we now turn to the analysis based on the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "the traditional form of the dyson - schwinger equation in the diagrammatic representation is shown in figure  [ fig : ds ] .",
    "this method is less intuitive compared to the previous renormalization group analysis , but it lets us obtain the actual size of the gap .",
    "this analysis is microscopic which deals with the quarks rather than the quasi - particles of the effective theory and interactions are the qcd interactions rather than the effective ones .    as usual , we adopt the nambu - gorkov formalism ( see , _",

    "notice that if the condensates , @xmath155 , in the denominators vanish there are terms that diverge as the energy is scaled toward the fermi surface , _ i.e. _ , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "this is essentially due to the sign structure of the chemical potential in the matrix ( [ eq : invngprop ] ) and to the fact that the @xmath148-matrices occupy off block - diagonal components .",
    "this infrared divergence is cured by the formation of the condensate and the @xmath148 properly behaves as such a condensate .",
    "if this were the traditional four - dimensional set up , we could have introduced the @xmath158-wave diquark condensate ( @xmath159-pair ) in the nambu - gorkov propagator .",
    "[ such condensate would have occupied the anti - diagonal slots of the matrix ( [ eq : invngprop ] ) .",
    "] however , this is not allowed in our theory .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : dsextra ] ,    since @xmath48 and @xmath49 separately live on the d8 and @xmath36 branes , the dyson - schwinger equation for such condensate can not make sense . in the previous macroscopic renormalization group analysis , we encoded all the information about the extra dimension in the form factors and the left- and right - handed quarks effectively lived in the same four dimensional spacetime .",
    "however , in this microscopic dyson - schwinger analysis , we see that it is actually not possible for the @xmath159-condensate to form .",
    "we emphasize that the condensate is not being energetically suppressed but simply not possible to form in the brane system of sakai and sugimoto .",

    "one can verify in this case that the infrared divergence near the fermi surface is not present .",
    "thus , the nambu - gorkov basis is not suitable for introducing the particle - hole chiral condensate .",

    "the spinors of the second set have the chemical potentials in their kinetic terms with opposite sign from the first set .",
    "this effectively introduces the hole degrees of freedom . in this case",

    "we note that since the condensate is formed out of the spinors with the dotted- or undotted - index pair , and not the mixed one , the condensate lives either on d8 or @xmath36 branes and not across them .",
    "we must also consider the gluon propagator which is the other ingredient of the dyson - schwinger equation .",
    "unlike previous macroscopic treatment , we properly take into account of the perturbatively computable screening effect .",
    "the most general form of the @xmath62-invariant gluon propagator is @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the electric and magnetic screenings , respectively , and the projectors are defined as @xmath171 we have dropped the term with the gauge fixing parameter in the propagator . this term has been verified not to contribute to the gap , the solution to the dyson - schwinger equation , at very large chemical potential @xcite .",

    "this is expected to completely dominate the d8 probe actions , which scale as @xmath249 , so the confinement / deconfinement phase transition line is not affected by the value of the chemical potential .",
    "therefore , horigome and tanii assume that the phase below the confinement / deconfinement line is in the configuration ( a ) of figure  [ fig : threephases ] , and compare the d8 actions of the configurations ( b ) and ( c ) in the deconfined d4-background geometry to obtain the phase structure above the confinement / deconfinement phase transition line . this is why the @xmath22s/@xmath22sb phase transition line of the right panel in figure  [ fig : htphased ] is terminated at @xmath247 .",

    "this implies the change in the degrees of freedom and since only the two phases are assumed , there should be a phase transition",
    ". stated differently , in this simplified picture of qcd , we expect that a phase transition to occur even at zero temperature . see figure  [ fig : simplified ] . @xmath252",
    "super - yang - mills theory on three sphere and type iib supergravity on ads@xmath253 both have qualitatively the same phase structure as figure  [ fig : simplified ] @xcite . in these cases , however , the chemical potential is conjugate to the @xmath52 subgroup of @xmath254 @xmath17-symmetry . ]",
    "though the physical setups are similar , we see that the phase diagrams in figures  [ fig : htphased ] and [ fig : simplified ] are qualitatively different .",
    "we suspect that the discrepancy stems from the large @xmath24 limit and the probe approximation in the sakai - sugimoto model .",

    "it is unlikely that this picture can change in the probe approximation .",
    "therefore , in order to see modifications in the confinement / deconfinement phase transition line , one should take into account of the d8-brane back reaction to the geometry .",
    "it is also clear that we do not observe the color superconductivity or chiral density waves in the strong coupling analysis of horigome and tanii because these possibilities are simply not considered . to explore those exotic phases",

    "such stringy pictures of quark matter are , so far , not clear to us .",
    "nevertheless , we make some general remarks in this direction .",
    "first , we must remember that the relevant degrees of freedom at high density are particles and holes while the anti - particles are buried deep in the dirac sea .",
    "thus , if the u - shape configuration of the d8-branes describes the mesons , which are the pairs of particle and anti - particle , then we expect the configuration of the superconductor or chiral density waves to be different from the u - shape configuration because they are the pairs of particles and holes .",
    "secondly , the fermi sphere plays the essential role in high density qcd .",
    "thus , the fermi sphere must be encoded in the holographic picture somehow .",
    "also , the holography is in the t hooft limit under which we do not expect non - gauge invariant quantities to survive .",
    "therefore , it is likely that we do not observe the color superconducting phase and the relevant phase probably is the chiral density waves in the holographic theories .",
    "although shuster and son @xcite settled that the color superconductivity dominates over the chiral density waves in the high density weakly coupled qcd ( with @xmath18 ) , it still is not known if this observation persists at the medium density strong coupling region .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model in the usual t hooft limit is not likely to be able to address this problem but it is interesting to examine this in the limit with @xmath256 fixed . in this case , we can expect the effect of the color - flavor locking to be significant and also the competition between the d4 and d8 actions becomes non - trivial .    finally , as we have mentioned in the introduction , the rich structure of the qcd phase diagram is partly due to the quark masses .",
    "as the authors of reference  @xcite have already noted , the inclusion of the quark masses involves the tachyon that comes from the string stretching between the d8 and @xmath36 branes .",
    "this subject is being actively studied ( for example , see refs.@xcite ) and the resulting phase diagram is yet to be seen .    _",
