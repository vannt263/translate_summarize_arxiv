    "the wmap result of the surprising detection of a large thompson electron optical depth of @xmath9 @xcite and questions about whether the intergalactic opacity at @xmath10 is due to the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) or to discrete absorbers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have led observers to try and push discovery techniques into the near - infrared ( nir ) and beyond the redshift of the most distant sloan quasars @xcite .    to reconcile the possible gunn - peterson troughs observed in high redshift quasar spectra and the wmap results , the fact that the ionizing photon density at high redshift appears to be declining ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the rapidly increasing density necessary to ionize the igm at successively higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the universe may have had a complex reionization history .",
    "indeed , these arguments led some researchers to propose complex models such as extended partial reionization ( e.g , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or twice reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in these complex scenarios ,",
    "the discovery of even one high redshift star - forming galaxy provides powerful constraints on the sources of reionization and on how star formation proceeded in the early universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but discovering galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath11 becomes increasingly challenging .",
    "rest - frame emission longwards of the lyman limit is redshifted to observed @xmath12    and the faintness of the galaxies makes them extremely difficult to detect .",
    "the essential spectroscopic confirmation is hampered by the dramatic increase in the density of telluric oh emission bands at @xmath12   .",
    "there are regions @xmath13    wide that are relatively devoid of oh lines and narrow - band surveys for high redshift sources within these windows have been successful ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". outside of these windows , even determining redshifts of color selected galaxies is generally very difficult at @xmath14 .",
    "one technique developed to overcome the difficulty of detecting the most distant galaxies takes advantage of gravitational lensing by an intervening galaxy cluster to boost the apparent brightness of background sources",
    ". this boost can be as much as a factor of @xmath15 along the critical lines for lensing .",
    "@xcite proved the feasibility of this technique out to @xmath16 and @xcite discovered a probable lensed @xmath17 lyman break galaxy behind a2218 .",
    "the efficiency of gravitational lensing assisted searches compared to blank field searches is , however , sensitive to the slope of the luminosity function and thus its overall utility in finding large numbers of high redshift galaxies has yet to be assessed .",
    "@xcite reported the identification of a highly magnified galaxy lying on a critical line of the @xmath18 cluster a1835 ( which they denoted a1835 - 1916 ) .",
    "their data set included broad - band optical imaging from the _ hst _ and the cfht along with nir imaging and spectroscopy with isaac at the vlt .",
    "the object was undetected in the @xmath19 optical bands , and only detected at @xmath20 in @xmath6 and @xmath3 in @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22-band detection quoted by @xcite is formally an upper limit .",
    "the optical non - detection , the large break between the @xmath22 and @xmath6 bands , and the blue @xmath23 color ( @xmath24 ) found by @xcitecould possibly indicate a young galaxy at extremely high redshift . in their @xmath22-band spectroscopy @xcitereported an emission line at 1.33745  , detected in two separate wavelength settings of the spectrograph and with a combined significance of @xmath25 .",
    "the photometry , together with the lensing model suggesting the source lies on a caustic for very high redshift ( with a magnification factor between 25 and 100 as being most likely ) , led @xciteto argue that the line is most likely ly@xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum is insufficient to show the telltale signature of the line profile asymmetry of highly redshifted ly@xmath26 to rule out other line identifications . given the uncertainties in the lensing model , the most important piece of evidence upon which the conclusion of @xmath4 rests is the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) measured from the imaging data .",
    "however , the high redshift nature of this source has been recently questioned .",
    "based on new independent @xmath6-band data obtained with niri at the gemini north telescope , @xcite did not detect the @xmath4 candidate down to the @xmath3 limit of @xmath7 .",
    "this limit is 1 magnitude deeper than the @xmath20 detection quoted by @xcite in their isaac data .",
    "this significantly weakens the main evidence for a redshift of 10 , which relies on the strength of the break between the optical and @xmath22 bands and the @xmath6 band .",
    "the photometry no longer constrains the redshift and other identifications for the emission line from a lower redshift source remain possible .",
    "before the @xcite results were obtained , we were awarded director s discretionary time with fors1 at the vlt to conduct @xmath0-band imaging of the field around the @xmath4 candidate and push the sensitivity to fainter levels than presented by @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-band detection would be decisive : it would demonstrate beyond any doubt that the source is _ not _ at @xmath4 .",
    "besides probing rest - frame wavelengths @xmath28    for @xmath4 , well below the lyman limit , we chose the @xmath0-band to reach within a reasonable observing time very sensitive limits compared to other optical or nir bands and thus provide the best chance of detecting a reddened @xmath29 object , which seems a likely alternative ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0-band observations of a1835 were carried out during director s discretionary time on the nights of 2004 july 9 , 16 , and 19 ( ut ) .",
    "we used fors1 on the vlt - kueyen telescope in imaging mode with a projected scale of @xmath30 .",
    "forty - eight separate frames of 350  s each were taken , for a total integration time of 16.8  ks .",
    "half of the integration time was taken on 2004 july 16 and one - third on 2004 july 19 , with only a small fraction ( 1/6 ) on 2004 july 9 .",
    "the conditions were clear and the seeing was typical for the vlt in the optical , varying from 05 to 10 with a median of about 07 .",
    "each individual dithered exposure had a unique ( non - redundant ) pointing position , centered around the location of the @xmath4 candidate .",
    "we reduced the data within iraf as follows .",
    "we subtracted the bias from each frame using bias frames taken at the beginning and end of each night .",
    "we flattened each frame initially with flat field images produced by a combination of dithered sky images taken during twilight . from these bias - subtracted and flat - fielded images",
    ", we created a master sky flat by combining all of the dithered exposures of the target field , masking out all sources above @xmath31 of the average rms of each frame ( the rms calculated including the whole frame ) .",
    "this flat was divided into each dithered frame . from the master sky",
    "flat , we also generated the bad pixel map used to exclude the bad pixels in each frame during the final combination .",
    "we determined the offsets between individual exposures by fitting the position of about 30 bright , unsaturated stars .",
    "we co - averaged the reduced , registered frames using three different weightings : is applied as multiplicative factor @xmath32 . ]",
    "( 1 ) uniform weighting , ( 2 ) weighting by the seeing fwhm of each frame , which gives most weight to the frames with best seeing , and ( 3 ) weighting by the fwhm times the squared root of the average sky counts in each frame , which accounts for the rms noise within the seeing disk and optimizes for point - source detection .",
    "there is little variation in the sensitivity of the final images between the three different schemes .",
    "the latter two produce final combinations with the best fwhm of @xmath33 . for the analysis",
    ", we adopted the image combined following the third weighting scheme .    to flux - calibrate the data we measured the photometric zero points using exposures of standard stars taken at the beginning and end of each night .",
    "we compared these measurements to zero points estimated throughout the month encompassing the range of observing dates .",
    "all zero points were in excellent agreement ( within @xmath34 ) and the final calibration is based on the average measured by eso during 2004 july when our data were taken .",
    "the average sky brightness in the final image is @xmath35 , and varies among the individual frames by a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "band , the ab correction is very small , with @xmath36 for fors1 accounting for the full system transmission . ]",
    "figure  [ fig - vmap ] shows the @xmath37 region in our @xmath0-band image around the reported location of the candidate @xmath4 galaxy .",
    "we do not detect any source at this position down to the faintest levels reached in our data .",
    "this implies a @xmath3 limit of @xmath38 in a 2-diameter aperture , as described below .",
    "our limit is 0.6  mag deeper than the @xmath3 limit of @xcite given for a 06 aperture , or about 3.5  mag deeper for an aperture of 3 times the fwhm ( 076 ) of their @xmath0-band data , assuming uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "we assessed our ability to reliably set a meaningful upper limit to any possible source at the position of the @xmath4 candidate using three different techniques .",
    "first we established the pixel - to - pixel rms variations in the background across the entire image .",
    "for this purpose , we used the sextractor software @xcite .",
    "sextractor estimates the local background level in a mesh grid over the image .",
    "these local background estimates are iteratively clipped until they converge to @xmath39 around the median of all meshes .",
    "the histogram of all remaining unclipped pixels is then used to determine the rms variations of the background noise in the image .",
    "this procedure yielded an overall @xmath3 detection limit of @xmath40 in a 2-diameter aperture .",
    "however , this limit is pessimistic because our image is very crowded with cluster and background galaxies at the depths reached : the surface density of faint sources is such that there is typically only about 4  between adjacent objects .",
    "thus , the rms variations derived in this way partly reflect extended light profiles of the myriad of galaxies in the image .    to obtain more realistic estimates of our detection limits in the area around the @xmath4 candidate , we focussed our analysis to the region within @xmath41  of its reported location .",
    "we placed 30 - 60 apertures 2  in diameter all away from the outer light profile of any obvious object in this @xmath42 area .",
    "this procedure was repeated several times with differing numbers of apertures and positions to ensure that our final estimates were not critically dependent on the number of apertures or their exact placement .",
    "the average pixel - to - pixel rms within these apertures implies a @xmath3 detection limit of @xmath5 , with variations of @xmath43 between the apertures .",
    "the variation in the total residual flux within each aperture implies a @xmath3 detection limit of @xmath44 .    to further determine the robustness of our detection limits",
    ", we placed 20 artificial point sources each at 3 different ab magnitudes , 27.6 , 27.8 and 28.0 , within @xmath41  of the reported location of the @xmath4 candidate and avoiding all obvious sources in this region .",
    "the high degree of crowding limits the number of point souces that can be placed non - redundantly close to the position of the @xmath4 candidate to about 20 .",
    "we recovered the sources down to @xmath45 at a rate similar to that expected for a @xmath3 detection limit ( i.e. 50% ) , and the dispersion between the measured and true input brightness was @xmath46 .",
    "given the excellent agreement between the two most robust methods , we adopted @xmath5 as the detection limit in a 2aperture at the position of the @xmath4 candidate .",
    "the non - detection in our vlt fors1 @xmath47band data down to a faint limit has implications for the nature of the source investigated by @xcite .",
    "formally , a non - detection is consistent with the candidate having a redshift of 10 .",
    "the bessel @xmath0 band filter has an effective wavelength of 5540    and half maximum transmission at about 5000 and 6000   . for @xmath4",
    ", these wavelengths correspond to 500    and the range @xmath48    in the rest - frame  well below the lyman limit and completely opaque .",
    "the lower limit to the redshift , if the @xmath0-band non - detection is caused solely by the igm opacity below the lyman limit , is @xmath49 .",
    "however , there is substantial opacity within the lyman forest at these redshifts and thus @xmath0-band lyman break or drop - out galaxies have redshifts that are usually less than this ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although our @xmath0-band non - detection may allow for @xmath50 , or even @xmath51 , this is not the only interpretation possible in view of other lines of evidence that have recently come to light .",
    "there are certainly two other hypotheses that are equally plausible , and perhaps significantly more likely .    the strongest evidence for the @xmath4 interpretation presented by @xcite relied on the large break among the optical , @xmath22 , and @xmath6 bands , and the subsequent detection of an emission line at 1.33745  .",
    "however , this evidence has now been called into question .",
    "@xcite did not detect the candidate object in their new independent and @xmath52 deeper @xmath6-band image from niri down to @xmath53 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this greatly weakens the argument based on the break strength ( as well as the blue @xmath23 color ) that supported the claim for the emission line being ly@xmath26 at @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have recently questioned the robustness of the line detection . however , this was based on a re - analysis of the spectroscopic data used by @xcite and subtle differences in reduction techniques could lead to contentious results .",
    "it is probably reasonable to conclude that the significance of the line is difficult to judge .",
    "if the object is not at a redshift of 10 , then what could it be ?",
    "one way forward is to assume the reality of the line , use the sensitive @xmath6-band limit of @xcite , and assume an alternative line identification to determine if the emission properties are reasonable for a galaxy at a lower redshift .",
    "@xciteargued that the source could be a dwarf / hii galaxy at intermediate redshift and that lines such as the [ ] @xmath55 doublet , [ ] @xmath56 , or h@xmath26 at @xmath57 are the most likely alternatives to ly@xmath26 .",
    "if it were [ ] , then the line width and luminosity would be consistent with the local relationship for dwarf/ galaxies between these quantities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in light of our new @xmath0-band results , we wish to further this argument .",
    "assuming the line is [ ] at @xmath58 and adopting reasonable cosmological parameters ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) , our @xmath0-band limit implies an unlensed absolute magnitude fainter than @xmath62 at 2080   .",
    "since there is no published detailed analysis of the mass model of the intervening cluster , it is difficult to quantitatively assess the magnification factor for @xmath58 ( @xcite suggested a magnification factor of between 25 and 100 for a source at @xmath4 ) .",
    "conservatively , we assume no lensing ; lensing will only make the source intrinsically fainter .",
    "the co - moving density of galaxies in the local universe with absolute magnitude @xmath63 at 2000    is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the number of such sources on the sky with @xmath65 is then @xmath66 if the uv luminosity function does not evolve out to @xmath67 .",
    "the luminosity function of @xmath68 lyman break galaxies implies a roughly similar surface density for such faint objects @xcite .",
    "comparable densities would be inferred to a factor of @xmath691.5 if the line were h@xmath26 at @xmath70 or [ ] at @xmath71 .",
    "the surface density of sources down to the detection limit of our image is @xmath7250 arcmin@xmath73 ( modulo the incompleteness ) .",
    "therefore the probability of finding and perhaps even mistaking it for a very high redshift source is consequently high .",
    "the immediate explanation is that the source might simply be fainter .",
    "however , this poses problems when trying to reconcile the broad - band flux limits with the reported emission line flux .",
    "the @xmath3 @xmath6-band limit obtained by @xcite coupled with the line flux given by @xcite implies an observed equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath74    ( assuming a flat @xmath75 continuum between 1.65 and 1.34  ; if the source were redder [ bluer ] as suggested by @xcite , the ew limit would be higher [ lower ] ) .",
    "assuming the line is [ ] at @xmath58 , the corresponding rest - frame ew is @xmath76   . for the alternative case of h@xmath26 at @xmath70 , @xmath77   , and of [ ] , @xmath78   .",
    "locally , such large ews are only found in galaxies with low metallicity and blue colors @xcite .",
    "although the @xcite@xmath6-band limit sets a reasonably stringent lower limit on the ew of the line , our @xmath0-band limit may provide an even stronger constraint .",
    "locally , sources with large emission line ews are very blue , with @xmath79 colors always bluer than for a flat @xmath75 spectrum @xcite . for sources at @xmath80",
    "this implies observed @xmath81 .",
    "supposing again the source is at @xmath58 and assuming conservatively it has a flat @xmath75 spectrum , our limit of @xmath82 implies an @xmath6-band limit of @xmath83 and , repeating the reasoning above , a rest - frame ew for [ ] of @xmath84  (@xmath85500    if h@xmath26 , @xmath85300  if [ ] ) . for a bluer spectrum as observed locally , the line ew limit only increases . a similar argument would apply to any other optical line .",
    "such high ews are rarely observed , would require a very young age ( @xmath86 ) and perhaps an initial mass function heavily skewed toward massive stars .",
    "summarizing the above arguments , our sensitive @xmath0-band limit implies a faint intrinsic uv ( @xmath87   ) absolute magnitude .",
    "plausible luminosity functions predict a high surface density of such objects and thus a high probability of detection if the source were just bright enough to match the @xmath3 limiting magnitude of our @xmath0-band image .",
    "no object is detected at the expected location despite the high density @xmath88 of @xmath89 sources in the data .",
    "postulating then that the object could be fainter , the lower limits on the rest - frame ew of the emission line become very large and the probability of detecting such a source becomes very low .",
    "thus , in view of the simple astrophysics of line emission , the scenario of an intermediate redshift dwarf does not appear very likely given the difficulties in reconciling the broad - band limits with the emission line flux . additionally ,",
    "although largely circumstantial , the arguments could perhaps cast doubt on the reported line flux @xcite .",
    "the other possible scenario is that the source may be transient or variable .",
    "the nir isaac images and spectra presented by @xcite were taken in 2003 february and late june to early july , respectively .",
    "the niri @xmath6-band data were collected during two nights in 2004 late may and early june .",
    "the @xmath0-band data discussed here were obtained in 2004 mid - july .",
    "overall , these observations span a period of about a year and a half .    given the ecliptic latitude of the a1835 field at about 14@xmath90 , one hypothesis could be that the source is a solar system object with a large proper motion .",
    "the tightest constraint comes from the time over which all of the @xcite isaac @xmath6-band data were taken .",
    "the observations were carried out over 24 hours on 2003 february 15 and 16 and the seeing in the final @xmath6-band image is @xmath91 .",
    "conservatively , for the source not to appear extended would imply an angular velocity of @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "if the source is bound to the sun and consistent with a distant object like pluto , for example , with a tangential velocity of @xmath94 , it would lie at more than d=1240  au . to be unresolved in the 05 @xmath6-band image at the distance derived from the proper motion limit",
    ", the source would have to be smaller than @xmath95 jupiter diameters .",
    "the brightness of an object illuminated by reflected sunlight and assuming an albedo of one , is related to its angular diameter , @xmath96 , by m = m@xmath97 - 5 log(@xmath96/2d ) . from the size calculated above the source",
    "would have @xmath9855 mag .",
    "an object with the magnitude as claimed by @xcite would have to be a million times larger than what we roughly estimated and thus would violate the size constraint by 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "it is possible to relax these constraints by an order of magnitude , but even given more optimistic estimates , a solar system object seems highly unlikely .",
    "it is more difficult to estimate the probably that the source is a high redshift supernova , @xmath99-ray burst or perhaps something more exotic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite determined a sn rate of about 5.5 @xmath100 10@xmath101 sn yr@xmath102 mpc@xmath103 at @xmath104@xmath1050.7 - 0.8 and using a model for the star - formation rate density evolution , they estimate about a factor of 2 increase in the sn rate at z@xmath1052 .",
    "the magnitude at which @xciteclaim to have detected the source is @xmath106 .",
    "it is difficult to know what the redshift of the source might be , especially since the photometry for a transient provides no constraints on the redshift .",
    "it is worth noting that distant sne generally have optical magnitudes fainter than the @xcitedetection ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and given the relatively blue sed of sne this means that the @xmath1 candidate would have been one of the brighter sne ( it is of course magnified by an unknown amount which could account for its relative brightness ) . at any rate",
    ", we can estimate the chances of finding a sne serendipitously in their field .",
    "assuming that the sn was caught within 30 days of its peak , that the redshift range of the sn was 0.5 - 1.0 ( roughly consistent with the range in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the area in the detection image was 6 arcmin@xmath107 , we would have expected 0.22 sn in the field based on the @xcite sne rate density .",
    "thus the candidate as an intermediate redshift sn can not be ruled out .",
    "however , this is surely optimistic given the magnitude of the detection claimed in the @xcite@xmath6-band image and the unknown magnification .",
    "lensing would decrease the probability by decreasing the effective area sampled . requiring the sn to be observed more closely to its peak in order make detection more likely would ( linearly ) lower the relative probability of observing it .",
    "neither of the transient hypotheses can explain the line detection .",
    "one would have to postulate that it comes from the host galaxy in the case of a sne from which there has been no subsequent continuum detection .",
    "given the ew arguments we made previously , this would have to be a very unusual object to escape detection .",
    "for a solar system object , the gap between the dates of the imaging and spectroscopy means that the source would have moved a significant distance from the discovery position and not within the subsequent slit spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , none of the possible transient hypotheses explain simply or logically all of the claims in @xcite .",
    "given the @xmath6-band non - detection of the source down to faint limits by @xciteand now in the v - band , and , the unlikely nature of any galaxy with the properties ( lower - limits ) observed , it is tempting to conclude that the most likely explanation is that the source is spurious .",
