    "muon colliders offer a wide range of opportunities for exploring physics within and beyond the standard model ( sm ) . an important potential application of these machines is the precision measurement of particle masses , widths and couplings .",
    "we estimate here the accuracy with which the @xmath0 and higgs boson masses can be determined from @xmath12 and @xmath4 threshold measurements at a muon collider@xcite .",
    "a muon collider is particularly well suited to the threshold measurement because the energy of the beam has a very narrow spread .",
    "the threshold cross section@xcite is most sensitive to @xmath14 just above @xmath15 , but a tradeoff exists between maximizing the signal rate and the sensitivity of the cross section to @xmath14 .",
    "detailed analysis @xcite shows that if the background level is small and systematic uncertainties in efficiencies are not important , then the optimal measurement of @xmath14 is obtained by collecting data at a single energy @xmath16 where the threshold cross section is sharply rising .",
    "= 3.0 in    for a lep2 measurement with 100  pb@xmath5 of integrated luminosity the background and systematic uncertainties are , in fact , sufficiently small that the error for @xmath14 will be limited by the statistical uncertainty of the measurement at @xmath17 .",
    "but , at a muon collider at high luminosity , systematic errors arising from uncertainties in the background level and the detection / triggering efficiencies will be dominant unless some of the luminosity is devoted to measuring the level of the background ( which automatically includes somewhat similar efficiencies ) at an energy below the @xmath3 threshold . then , assuming that efficiencies for the background and @xmath12 signal are sufficiently well understood that systematic uncertainties effectively cancel in the ratio of the above - threshold to the below - threshold rates , a very accurate @xmath14 determination becomes possible .",
    "the dominant background derives from @xmath18 which is essentially energy independent  @xcite below 180  gev . for our present analysis we model the background as energy independent , and",
    "accordingly assume that one measurement at an energy in the range 140 to 150  gev suffices to determine the background .",
    "we analyze our ability to determine the @xmath0 mass via just two measurements : one at center of mass energy @xmath19 , just above threshold , and one at @xmath20 .",
    "the optimal @xmath1 measurement is obtained by expending about two - thirds of the luminosity at @xmath19 and one - third at @xmath20 .",
    "combining the three modes , an overall precision of @xmath21 should be achievable .",
    "the combination of the measurements of the masses @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to such high precision has dramatic implications for the indirect prediction of the mass of the higgs boson and for other sources of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] . assuming the current central values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and that @xmath25 ( @xmath9 ) is devoted to the measurement of @xmath26 ( @xmath14 ) , the mass of the sm higgs boson would be determined to be 260 gev with an error of about @xmath27  gev from @xmath28  mev at a fixed @xmath1 , and about @xmath29  gev from @xmath6  mev at a fixed @xmath2 . for @xmath30  gev",
    ", the corresponding values would be @xmath31  gev and @xmath8  gev , respectively .",
    "more generally , the @xmath32 value scales roughly like @xmath33 .",
    "a very accurate determination of @xmath35 is obtained by measuring the threshold cross section for the bjorken higgs - strahlung process  @xcite @xmath36 . with integrated luminosity @xmath37 ,",
    "a @xmath38 precision of order 45  mev is possible for a sm higgs @xmath11 at a @xmath10 collider .",
    "this error in @xmath35 is smaller than that achievable via final state mass reconstruction for a typical detector , and would then be the most accurate determination of @xmath35 at an @xmath39 collider .",
    "the sm higgs boson is easily discovered in the @xmath40 production mode by running the machine well above threshold ,  at @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    "the dominant higgs boson decay is to @xmath43 and most backgrounds can be eliminated by @xmath44-tagging . the best means for measuring @xmath35 will be to first determine @xmath35 to within a few hundred mev in @xmath41 running , which will also yield a precise measurement of @xmath45 , and then reconfigure the collider for maximal luminosity in the threshold energy region @xmath46 .    in fig .",
    "[ zhcurve ] we show the cross section for the bjorken process @xmath36 for higgs masses from 50 to 150  gev .",
    "since the threshold behavior is @xmath47-wave , the rise in the cross section ( which is a few tenths of a pb ) in the threshold region is rapid .",
    "= 3.0 in    in the ideal case that the normalization of the measured @xmath40 cross section as a function of @xmath48 can be precisely predicted , including efficiencies and systematic effects , sensitivity to the sm higgs boson mass is maximized by a single measurement of the cross section at @xmath49  gev , just above the real particle threshold .",
    "as an example of the precision that might be achieved , suppose @xmath50  gev and backgrounds are neglected .",
    "the @xmath40 cross section is 120  fb and is rising at a rate of 0.05  fb / mev . with @xmath51 and including an overall ( @xmath44-tagging , geometric and event identification ) efficiency of @xmath52 , this yields @xmath53 events , or a measurement of the cross section to about 2% . from the slope of the cross section one",
    "concludes that a @xmath35 measurement with accuracy of roughly 50  mev is possible .    for a more precise estimate of the accuracy with which @xmath35 can be measured",
    ", we employ @xmath44-tagging and cuts in order to reduce the background to a very low level .",
    "these cuts and other systematic uncertainties are discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "the background is very much smaller than the signal unless @xmath35 is close to @xmath54 .",
    "we note that electroweak radiative corrections to the cross section are estimated to be less than 1% for @xmath55  gev@xcite .",
    "a precision of the sm higgs mass determination to within 45for @xmath11 may be achievable at a muon collider .    outside the standard model the cross section generally depends on the higgs mass , the @xmath56 coupling ( @xmath57 ) and the total higgs width ( @xmath58 ) . in order to simultaneously determine @xmath35 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",
    "measurements could be made at the three c.m .",
    "energies @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . the solid curves in fig .  [ zhsin2 ]",
    "show the statistical precision that can be obtained for @xmath11 in a three - parameter fit to @xmath35 , @xmath62 and @xmath58 , including smearing effects from bremsstrahlung , beamstrahlung and beam energy spread at a muon collider , using an integrated luminosity of 100/3  fb@xmath5 at each of the above three values of @xmath48 in the threshold region .",
    "the crosses in the center of the ellipses indicate the input values . with a three - parameter fit ,",
    "the attainable error in @xmath35 is about @xmath63 at the @xmath38 level .",
    "the second panel in fig .",
    "[ zhsin2 ] shows that there is significant sensitivity to the higgs width @xmath58 if it is of order 100 mev .",
    "if @xmath58 is very narrow ( @xmath64 is predicted in the sm ) then @xmath65 is possible ( see the dashed ellipse ) from a fit to @xmath35 and @xmath66 by devoting 50  fb@xmath5 at each of two c.m .",
    "energies , @xmath67  gev and @xmath68  gev .",
    "measurements that would simultaneously determine @xmath35 , @xmath66 and @xmath69 could be done at a level of accuracy that could distinguish a standard model higgs boson from its many possible (  supersymmetric ) extensions .",
    "a muon collider offers an unparalleled opportunity for precision @xmath0 and higgs mass measurements in the respective threshold regions .",
