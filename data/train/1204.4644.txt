    "since the locations of the sources of radio emission in  are of special interest in this paper , we emphasize here that we took care in our scheduling to achieve an approximately even distribution of orbital phase , without strong correlations between phase and either year or season .",
    "the phase - referencing process by which we estimated the position of  for each observing session included both phase - delay fitting with a kalman - filter estimator and phase - reference mapping ( see paper iv for details ) .",
    "this process improves our astrometric accuracy by allowing us to effectively model the contributions of the troposphere , ionosphere , and the extended structure of s radio emission regions ( see  [ thechoice ] ) , in spite of the often low flux density ( as low as @xmath60.2  mjy ) of the stellar radio emission .",

    "the identification and stationarity of this reference point are discussed in papers ii and iii , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in , our phase - referenced images reveal three general categories for the radio source structure of : ( 1 ) single - peaked with peak located near the center of a marginally extended source ; ( 2 ) single - peaked with peak located off center of an elongated source ; and ( 3 ) double - peaked ( or in one case apparently triple - peaked ) with maximum separation between peaks of @xmath61.5  mas .",
    "an example from each of these categories is given in .",
    "for the definition of the `` observed '' position for  we considered three possible choices : ( i ) the position of the brightness peak , interpolated between pixels , of the image for each epoch , ( ii ) the central position of the single elliptical gaussian fit to the image for each epoch , and ( iii ) the central position of the single fit gaussian for each single - peaked epoch and the position of the unweighted midpoint between interpolated brightness peaks for each multiple - peaked epoch .",
    "we then fit the astrometric model described in  [ model ] below to each set of positions .",
    "we obtained the best fit for choice ( iii ) : the chi - square per degree of freedom for the resulting weighted least - squares fit was 30% lower than for the worst fit , that for choice ( i ) .",
    "we therefore adopted set ( iii ) as our standard set of 35  positions for the estimate of position at epoch , proper motion , parallax , and orbital parameters of .",
    "set ( iii ) represents in effect smoothed data , taking into account the extended structure of the source . for the study of the locations of the sources of radio emission in this paper , however , the distribution of the locations of emission peaks is more important , and therefore set ( i ) is used for such an investigation , as described below in  [ skymodel ] .",
    "we fit to the 35 positions of set ( iii ) a nine - parameter model describing the motion of the  radio emission on the sky .",
    "the model parameters are the five scalar parameters needed to specify s position at a reference epoch , its proper motion , and its parallax , plus four more to specify the projection on the sky of its ( assumed ) zero - eccentricity orbit of known period .",
    "to maintain the linearity of the model in all unknown parameters , we let the orbit parameters for each coordinate ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) be the amplitudes of the sine ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) and cosine ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) terms in orbital phase .",

    "our estimate of the length of the semimajor axis of @xmath54  mas is both statistically significant and consistent within @xmath55 with that of the semimajor axis inferred for the  primary from optical spectroscopy ( see  [ known ] , table  [ thestar ] ) .",
    ". the ratio of the length of the minor axis to that of the major axis of the projected orbit of @xmath56 is relatively small allowing for a relatively accurate estimate of the position angle ( p.a . ) of the ascending node , @xmath57 , and hence the p.a . of the projected orbit normal , @xmath58 .",
    "the time of conjunction , @xmath59 jd , implied by our orbit is also consistent within @xmath55 with that derived for the primary from optical spectroscopy ( see table  [ thestar ] ) .      in we show that the residuals of our nine - parameter astrometric fit to set ( iii ) of the 35 positions of  scatter about a well determined orbit on the sky .",
    "how does this fit determine the mean location of the radio emission source with respect to the optical primary and secondary of the binary system ?",
    "with a near zero - eccentricity orbit , the axial ratio of the projected radio orbit corresponds to an inclination of @xmath60 .",
    "combining our value for the inclination with the @xmath22 estimate of @xcite for each stellar component ( see table  [ thestar ] ) leads to semimajor axes of @xmath61  mas for the primary and @xmath62  mas for the secondary .",
    "thus our estimated semimajor axis of the radio orbit of @xmath63  mas agrees well with that of the spectroscopic orbit of the primary , but differs significantly from that of the secondary .",
    "furthermore , the time of conjunction , @xmath31 , obtained for the radio orbit is only @xmath64  d earlier than that found by @xcite ( see table  [ thestar ] ) .",
    "the estimated radio orbit is thus in the same phase within the error as the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "the above difference in @xmath31 corresponds to a physical offset between the center of the primary and the mean position of the radio emission from our model orbit that is only @xmath65 times the radius of the primary and is not significantly different from zero .",
    ", the distribution of our position solutions well covers the disk of the primary .",
    "therefore it appears that the emission locations are very closely linked to the primary and any constant or linearly changing offset of the center of this distribution from the center of the primary is likely smaller than the radius of the primary . ]",
    "that is , the offset is with @xmath55 accuracy likely to be distant from the center by less than @xmath0% of the radius of the primary .",
    "we therefore have strong observational evidence to conclude that the active primary is the source of the radio emission in .",
    "this result makes  only the second close binary system for which such an identification has unambiguously been made , the other being the close binary in the algol system @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ residonsky]@xmath52 the residuals of our set ( iii ) position solutions to our nine - parameter weighted least - squares astrometric fit .",
    "the residuals correspond to the positions plotted in figure  [ imorbit ] after removal of the model orbit .",
    "in addition we plot the disk of the primary , placing its center at the origin of the diagram .",
    "there are two important features in the sky - distribution of the residuals : first , almost all of the residuals lie inside of the disk of the primary , with some residuals going only slightly beyond it . in fact , the 0.55  mas root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter ( 0.35  mas in @xmath42 and 0.46  mas in @xmath43 ) is almost equal to the angular radius of the primary of @xmath66  mas ( table  [ thestar ] ) but smaller than the semimajor axis of the orbit of the primary of @xmath63  mas ( table  [ fitresults ] ) . with",
    "a relatively small mean standard error in the position determination of the stellar radio source of 0.07  mas in @xmath42 and 0.09  mas in @xmath43 , the scatter is largely intrinsic to the emission source.0.06  mas astrometric error in each  coordinate .",
    "the astrometric error includes the rms jitter of 3c  454.3 component c1 relative to our extragalactic reference frame . ]",
    "second , the residuals are scattered preferentially along a northwest - southeast oriented axis , approximately along the projected normal of the orbit .",
    "it is likely that this preferential elongation of the distribution of the residuals is also intrinsic to the emission source .",
    "the synthesized interferometer beam is by comparison more nearly oriented north - south ( mean @xmath67 ) .",
    "moreover , when we fit for the purposes of error analysis the same nine - parameter model to the positions of the secondary reference source b2250 + 194 ( which is @xmath65 times farther away from 3c  454.3 than ) , we found an approximately threefold smaller scatter in the rms residuals and a smaller correlation between coordinates .",
    "for the physical interpretation of the location of the source of radio emission it is more meaningful to study the distribution of the positions of the brightness peaks ( set i ) which indicate where the dominant part of the emission originates .",
    "we therefore added to the residual for each epoch the difference between the position of the interpolated brightness peak ( from set i ) and the position of the gaussian or midpoint ( from set iii ) used in our astrometric fit .",
    "use of these `` modified '' residuals ( hereafter referred to simply as residuals ) ensures that we are plotting the offsets of the interpolated brightness peak at each epoch from our estimated orbit ( see figure  [ residonsky]@xmath68 ) .",
    "the rms scatter about the mean is @xmath69  mas , and , as expected , somewhat larger than the rms scatter of 0.55 mas in figure  [ residonsky]@xmath52 .",
    "we determined the 0.03  mas standard error for the above sample estimate of rms scatter using a bootstrap method ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more specifically , we regarded the 35 residuals as the parent distribution and chose from this distribution a new set of 35 residuals , with each one being randomly selected from the parent distribution ( with replacement ) , until we obtained 500 different sets of 35 residuals . for our estimate of the standard error of the rms scatter of the true distribution ,",
    "i.e. , before sampling by our observations , we take the standard deviation of the 500 values of rms scatter that we computed from the 500 sets .",
    "we used this bootstrap method to derive standard errors for all parameters estimated from , or compared to , the 35 residuals , both here and , where relevant , hereafter .",
    "how can the scatter of the locations of brightness peaks be interpreted in terms of the geometry of the orbit and the relation to the primary ? in other words , how closely is the seemingly preferred direction of the scatter of these locations related to the normal of the orbit and the spin axis of the primary , and how far from the surface of the primary do the brightness peaks originate ?",
    "motivated by our astrometric solution and the distribution of the brightness peak locations in figure  [ residonsky]@xmath68 , we constructed a three - dimensional model to simulate emission regions in the corona of the primary .",
    "we call this model the coronal emission model ( cem ) .",
    "we then considered different distributions of locations of emission regions to find the best match to our observations and thereby obtain a reasonable model for the location of the source of radio emission in .",
    "we start with the latitude independent version of the cem . in this model",
    "we assume that on average the radio emission is centered , in projection on the sky , on the center of the stellar disk , and allow the location of peak brightness to fall with equal probability above any point on the stellar surface .",
    "we allow emission to occur at any height above the photosphere of the star , but assume that the probability that the emission peaks at a given height decreases exponentially with scale height , @xmath70 . ) of the observed residuals . ]",
    "we then project the cem onto the sky to compare our model distribution to the distribution of the locations of brightness peaks as plotted in figure  [ residonsky]@xmath68 .",
    "for emission from locations not occulted by the disk of the star , we simply project that location onto the sky . for emission locations occulted by the disk of the star , we allow `` spillover ; '' i.e.",
    ", we move the predicted location of observed peak emission outward along the radial line on the sky to a location we can see slightly beyond the edge of the stellar disk ( see below ) . allowing for spillover is perhaps reasonable , since we had a 100% detection rate and observed extended radio structure at every epoch ; however , as we shall later show , nature does not seem to have followed this path and there are other ways to understand the 100% detection rate .",
    "we do not account in any sophisticated way for the transmission of spillover emission through the corona , e.g. , by considering scattering , absorption , and/or refraction along the line of sight .",
    "instead , we arbitrarily allow a small radial distribution of this emission on the sky spanning a projected radius of 1.01.1 times the stellar radius .",
    "the adjustable parameter in the latitude - independent cem is @xmath70 .    to execute the comparison",
    ", we computed several sets of 5000 locations each for the cem , each set with the nominal value for the stellar radius but a different @xmath70 . for each",
    "set we compared the rms of the distribution of the radio - emission locations to the @xmath71  mas rms scatter of the observed residuals .",
    "we found agreement between the two rms values for @xmath72  mas ; i.e. , a scale height only @xmath73 times the 0.64  mas stellar radius .",
    "the standard error in @xmath70 is the variation in that parameter needed to produce an increase or decrease in rms of the distribution of the radio - emission locations equal to the standard error ( @xmath74  mas ) of the rms of the scatter in the residuals .",
    "we provide an illustration of the latitude - independent cem in figure  [ cemplot]@xmath52 .",
    "the figure illustrates that the latitude - independent cem produces a circularly symmetric distribution of emission locations on the sky .",
    "such a distribution fails qualitatively to describe the elongation in the scatter of the residuals .",
    "for a more direct comparison with the scatter of the 35 residuals , we produced several sets of 35 ( random ) emission locations from the latitude - independent cem , and for none of them was there more than a 16% difference between the rms along the line at which it was greatest from that along the line for which it was least .",
    "in contrast , the residuals show a @xmath75 difference between the rms scatter along the line for which this rms scatter is maximum ( @xmath76 ) and the line for which this scatter is minimum .      to improve upon our cem , we maintained our assumptions concerning spillover , but dropped our assumption of equal probability density per unit surface area .",
    "instead , we allowed this probability density to vary with stellar latitude , @xmath77 .",
    "this enhancement of our model was motivated by doppler optical surface images of the  primary which show persistent ( @xmath613 years and possibly longer ) , high - intensity spot features in both the mid - latitude range and directly over the visible pole @xcite .",
    "given the close alignment expected for the spin axis and the orbit normal ( see  [ discuss ] ) , we assumed that the spin axis of the primary is inclined @xmath78 to our line of sight , an angle equal to our vlbi - derived estimate of the inclination of the orbit ( see table  [ fitresults ] ) .",
    "we tried a number of different functional forms for the latitude dependence of the probability density distribution .",
    "we found that a distribution proportional to @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , yielded a good fit to the sky distribution of the residuals . for this @xmath81 value , the mean probability density per unit surface area for emission near each pole ( @xmath4 ) is @xmath3 higher than that for emission near the equator ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the indicated @xmath670% confidence limits reflect the uncertainty of the elongation of the scatter of the residuals , as estimated with our bootstrap approach .",
    "we also varied the scale height , and found best agreement between the distribution of the cem and the residuals for a value @xmath83 times the stellar radius . in figure  [ cemplot]@xmath68 we provide an illustration of the latitude - dependent cem oriented on the sky with the spin axis lying along @xmath84 , to align with the axis of the elongation of the distribution of our 35 residuals .",
    "the latitude - dependent cem with spillover emission gives us a distribution of projected emission points which is consistent with the distribution of residuals both in overall extent and degree of elongation . to compare the distributions in more detail",
    ", we looked at the number of emission points and residuals in each of three regions at increasing radial distances from the center of the distribution .",
    "based on the extent of the distribution , we chose the following regions : ( 1 ) @xmath850.40 mas , ( 2 ) 0.400.80 mas , and ( 3 ) @xmath100.80 mas .",
    "the regions are indicated by dashed circles in figure  [ residonsky]@xmath68 and in each of the panels in figure  [ cemplot ] .",
    "the results , given in table  [ cemcompare ] , show that the number of emission locations in region 2 is significantly higher for the latitude - dependent cem with spillover emission than for the observed residuals .",
    "figure  [ cemplot]@xmath68 shows clearly that , for the latitude - dependent cem with spillover emission , many of the emission locations in region 2 are from spillover . indeed ,",
    "35% of emission locations in this region , and 28% of all points in this model are due to spillover .",
    "the percentage of instances for which the radio brightness peak arises from spillover emission may , however , be much lower . here is why . in nine of 35 epochs ,",
    "our images of  show two ( or three ) local brightness maxima , with the maxima separated in four of those epochs by @xmath860.5 mas .",
    "since simultaneous emission from multiple regions appears common for , it is reasonable to expect that spillover emission be dominated in many instances by emission from the earth - facing side of the primary . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we modified the selection of projected emission locations in the latitude dependent cem with spillover emission . instead of allowing each occulted location to become spillover emission , we allowed , first , only 50% of occulted locations to become spillover emission , replacing the other 50% with ( randomly and independently drawn ) non - occulted locations .",
    "we then decreased the fraction of allowed occulted locations to zero in intervals of 5% ( i.e. , 45% , 40% ,  ) , adding the deleted ones at non - occulted locations .",
    "for each such fraction , we adjusted the scale height , @xmath70 , so as to maximize the agreement between the distribution of the cem emission locations and that of the residuals .",
    "we found the best agreement between the distribution of emission locations in the cem and that of the residuals , considering the number counts in the three regions defined above , for a reduced frequency of spillover emission with a fraction of @xmath87 of allowed locations ( see table  [ cemcompare ] ) , and a scale height @xmath88 times the stellar radius .",
    "we provide in figure  [ cemplot]@xmath89 an illustration of this latitude - dependent cem , with reduced spillover emission , oriented on the sky with the spin axis lying along @xmath90 .",
    "note that for our best fit model , in which the spillover from @xmath87 of emission peaks in the occulted region yields an observed brightness peak , the percentage of all emission peaks which occur due to spillover is just @xmath91 .",
    "thus , for a random sample of 35 emission locations , this value suggests that only @xmath922 of the locations arise from spillover emission .",

    "our astrometric result shows that the sources of radio emission are consistent with their being centered on average on the primary , and also consistent with theoretical models which propose that the radio emission in active close binaries is powered and confined by the magnetic field of the active star ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "second , a systematic time - dependence of the latitude distribution of spot centers could arise given the apparent multi - year stellar - activity cycle of the primary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the distribution of the radio emission locations",
    "at least partly linked ( see below ) to such spot features , an offset with a nonzero trend from 19972005 could plausibly contribute error to our proper - motion estimate .",
    "however , each of these possible causes would not result in the offset being larger than the radius of the primary .",
    "this estimate , together with the distribution s matching the disk of the primary , makes us believe that any offset at any time during our observations is indeed smaller than the radius of the primary .",
    "our position residuals are scattered preferentially along an axis with p.a .  of @xmath1 , which , to within the combined uncertainties , is equal to the p.a .  of the sky - projected orbit normal of @xmath2 .",
    "since the orbit normal is expected to be closely aligned with the spin axis of the primary as for all synchronous rs  cvn systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sources of radio emission appear to be linked to the spin axis of the primary .",
    "indeed , a comparison of the scatter of the position residuals with our simulations shows that the probability density per unit surface area for radio brightness peaks is @xmath3 higher near the poles ( @xmath112 ) than near the equator ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "since doppler images of  show the presence of persistent , high - intensity spot features at the pole region of the primary @xcite , our result provides statistical evidence that the radio emission regions occur at the same stellar latitudes as do active surface regions .",
    "our simulations place restrictions on the altitude of the locations of radio - emitting structures in the corona of the  primary . in our best - fit model , @xmath62/3 of the brightness peaks",
    "arise within an altitude of just 0.25 times the stellar radius .",
    "since the stellar magnetic field is presumably strongest near the surface , this result may not be surprising .",
    "however , it is different from the pictures presented for the close binary systems algol ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and ux  arietis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which show emission from magnetic - loop structures with heights greater than one stellar radius .",
    "if emission does occur high on magnetic loops for , then most of these loops are small in height compared to the radius of the primary .",
    "our simulations further allowed us to set at 6% the ( @xmath55 ) limit on the likelihood ( at any given epoch ) that the brightness peak arises from spillover .",
    "although this limit is model - dependent , we think that the more general conclusion , which is that the observed brightness peaks arise mostly from emission regions connected to the earth - facing side of the primary , is robust .",
    "spillover could , however , be responsible for lower - surface - brightness features of the radio structure .",
    "in many of our epochs , the radio structure is multi - peaked or at least significantly elongated .",
    "while the highest peak in these instances is likely to be associated with emission from the earth - facing side , spillover could very well contribute to the overall shape . in",
    ", we present the full set of  images with the outlines of the disk and orbit of the primary superimposed , and discuss in detail the size and shape of the radio emission regions .",
    "here we summarize our results and give our conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the sources of radio emission are on average located near the center of the disk of the primary , in particular being within @xmath114% of its radius of @xmath66 mas , provided any 8.5-yr constant or linearly changing offset is ( nearly ) zero .",
    "there are theoretical arguments as well as observational evidence that any such offset is indeed smaller than the radius of the primary .",
    "thus is the second close binary with such ( nearly ) unambiguous identification .",
    "the positions of the sources of observed radio emission are scattered over an area on the sky slightly larger than the disk of the primary and preferentially along an axis with p.a .",
    "this axis is closely aligned with the sky - projected orbit normal ( p.a .",
    "@xmath116 ) and expected spin axis of the primary .",
    "comparison of our observed positions with simulations suggests that the radio brightness peaks are more likely to occur at higher stellar latitudes than near the stellar equator , with the probability density per unit surface area being @xmath3 times higher near the poles ( @xmath112 ) than near the equator ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the radio emission regions therefore show a dependence on stellar latitude similar to that exhibited by active regions on the primary s surface seen as dark spots with optical doppler imaging .",
    "this comparison also suggests that these brightness peaks preferentially arise close to the surface of the primary , with @xmath62/3 of them located no more than 0.25 stellar radii above the surface .",
    "this comparison further suggests that the brightness peaks are mostly associated with emission regions on the earth - facing side of the primary , with peaks caused by spillover from emission regions on the opposite side of the star occurring rarely , if ever",
