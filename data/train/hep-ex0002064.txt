    "chiral perturbation theory offers a consistent description of low energy qcd particularly applicable to meson decays .",
    "an outstanding difficulty is the large discrepancy between the predicted and observed rate of the @xmath2 decay @xcite .",
    "we report here a measurement of the transition matrix element .",
    "the density of events on the dalitz plot has been predicted to be uniform by gasser and leutwyler @xcite and by di vecchia @xcite .",
    "more recently a calculation of kambor , wiesendanger and wyler @xcite found a density which decreases as the distance from the center of the plot increases .",
    "the dalitz plot density is specified by a single parameter , conventionally denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "show that both @xmath3 and the rate @xmath4 are sensitive to a parameter of the theory ( @xmath5 in their notation ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath7 on @xmath5 is such that a more negative value of @xmath6 reduces the value of @xmath7 thereby increasing the disagreement with experiment .",
    "two values of @xmath6 are determined by the authors of @xcite , -0.014 and -0.007 , the latter containing higher order corrections and leading to a prediction for @xmath4 more consistent with experiment .",
    "to second order in the center of mass pion energy @xcite - @xcite the dalitz plot density for the decay @xmath8 is parameterized as @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy of the @xmath12th pion in the @xmath13 rest frame , @xmath14 is the distance from the center of the dalitz plot and @xmath15 the largest kinematically allowable value of @xmath14 .    a uniformly populated dalitz plot , ( as predicted by @xcite and @xcite )",
    "gives @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath6 has been measured previously by baglin _",
    "@xcite , alde _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and abele _ et al .",
    "recent results are shown in figure [ systfig ] along with the result of this work .",
    "reference @xcite finds a value significantly different from zero and in probable disagreement @xmath17 with theoretical expectations .",
    "the results reported in @xcite and @xcite are consistent with both zero and the non - zero expectation of @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report on a determination of @xmath6 from the decay @xmath1 where the @xmath13 was produced by 18.3 gev / c negative pions incident on liquid hydrogen .",
    "the data were collected in 1995 by the brookhaven national laboratory e852 collaboration .",
    "the apparatus has been described previously @xcite,@xcite and consisted of a large , segmented lead glass calorimeter ( lgd ) , charged particle tracking , veto and trigger systems capable of determining the charged particle multiplicity and the total energy deposited in the lead glass .",
    "the data used for this analysis were collected with the `` all - neutral '' trigger which required no charged particles , an energy deposition greater than 12 gev in the lead glass and no photons in the downstream photon veto .",
    "@xmath1 decays were selected by requiring exactly 6 reconstructed clusters in the lgd and a visible total energy greater than 16.5 gev .",
    "all combinations of assignments to the hypothesis @xmath18 were tested and if the best @xmath19 corresponded to a confidence level greater than 1% the event was considered a candidate .",
    "a preliminary fit using only the @xmath20 mass constraint was performed to allow evaluation of the @xmath18 effective mass .",
    "figure [ 3pimass ] shows the resulting distribution .",
    "events with a mass less than 0.65 @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 from the @xmath13 mass ) were subjected to a full kinematic fit with the hypothesis @xmath23 ; @xmath1 . a confidence level ( cl )",
    "cut selected decays for the final analysis .",
    "it also was required that no photon have an energy less than 0.25 gev and that the minimum separation between photons be larger than 9 cm . the effect and purpose of these requirements",
    "is discussed below .",
    "the final resulting data set contained 87,500 events .    to determine @xmath6 , eq .",
    "[ matdef ] is fitted to the observed distribution of @xmath24 corrected for acceptance and phase space dependence .",
    "the acceptance correction was based on monte - carlo simulation , taking into account the apertures of the apparatus and a large sample of geant generated electromagnetic showers .",
    "the requirements on the minimum photon energy and the minimum allowable photon separation mentioned above removed any uncertainties in the monte - carlo simulation associated with the transverse development of electromagnetic showers and the behavior of low energy photons .",
    "the separation requirement also selected events where the nearest two electromagnetic showers were well resolved .",
    "the phase space dependence of z was removed by dividing the observed distribution by the distribution due to a uniformly populated dalitz plot .",
    "the distribution resulting from removing the phase space dependence and correcting for the acceptance is proportional to @xmath25 and is shown in figure [ zdist ] along with the result of the fit to eq .",
    "[ matdef ] .",
    "the distribution has been numerically scaled to give a proportionality constant of one .",
    "our result is @xmath26 , where the error is statistical only .",
    "systematic effects have been considered and the important contributors identified . since @xmath27 is a static property of the @xmath13 a measurement of @xmath27 can not depend on any data selection requirement , for example , momentum - transfer , separation of photons in the detector , photon energy detection thresholds , confidence level of fits , etc .",
    "it was observed that our measured @xmath27 remained constant as a function of the confidence level ( cl ) cut , down to about cl = 30% , below which @xmath27 began to fall slightly .",
    "this is consistent with an increasing contribution from reconstructed events with one or more wrong - assignments of a @xmath28 to a @xmath29 .",
    "it was required the an event have a confidence level greater than 30% for this analysis .",
    "studies of the variation of @xmath30 with the value chosen for the cl cut yielded an estimate of @xmath31 for the systematic contribution associated with this cut .",
    "the analysis further required that no two photons have reconstructed impact positions closer than 9 cm , a distance denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "variation of the value of @xmath32 used in the analysis between 8.5 and 11 cm yielded our estimate of @xmath33 for the contribution to the systematic error due to this effect .",
    "the effect of requiring the lowest energy photon to have an energy larger than 0.25 gev was investigated by removing this requirement ( increasing the data set by 1,140 events ) and by replacing it with a requirement of 0.5 gev ( decreasing the data set by 15,230 events ) .",
    "a contribution of @xmath34 to the systematic error was found .    for 20% of the events in the data sample it was possible to choose more than one assignment of photons to pions .",
    "the analysis presented here chose the assignment with the best confidence level .",
    "the effect of this choice was studied by choosing the _ second _ best assignment ( when possible ) and by using _ all _ assignments with an appropriate weight to calculate @xmath6 .",
    "no statistically significant differences were observed .",
    "finally , the data set was divided into two statistically independent halves by experimental run numbers and , separately , by range of momentum transfers . in both cases ,",
    "the values determined for @xmath6 were not statistically significantly different leading us to conclude these selections do not contribute to our systematic error .",
    "all effects considered combine to give our final estimate of @xmath35 for the systematic error .",
    "we have measured the @xmath6 parameter of the transition matrix element @xmath36 to be @xmath37 .",
    "our result differs from one of the previous measurements @xcite by slightly more than @xmath38 but is consistent with several other @xcite , @xcite measurements . when compared to theoretical expectations , the value of zero favored by di vecchia , gasser and leutwyler @xcite , @xcite , cannot be ruled out .",
    "the result reported here is consistent with the two values ( -0.007 and -0.014 ) reported by kambor , wiesendanger and wyler @xcite ."
