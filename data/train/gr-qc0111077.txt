    "in the recent two decades the dynamics of an isotropic universe filled with a massive scalar field attracted a great attention .",
    "there are several possible dynamical regimes in this system @xcite . from the physical point of view",
    "the inflationary regime is the most important one @xcite , therefore , one of the problems of mathematical cosmology is to describe the set of initial data leading to inflation .",
    "this problem for a massive scalar field was studied in @xcite .",
    "the main result of these studies is that the set of initial conditions required for inflation strongly depends on the sign of the spatial curvature .",
    "if it is negative or zero , the scale factor of the universe @xmath2 can not pass through extremum points .",
    "in this case all the trajectories starting from a sufficiently large initial value of the scalar field @xmath3 , reach a slow - roll regime and experience inflation . if we start from the planck energy , a measure of non - inflating trajectories for a scalar field with the mass @xmath4 is about @xmath5 . from observational reasons ,",
    "this ratio is about @xmath6 so almost all trajectories lead to the inflationary regime .",
    "however , positive spatial curvature allows a trajectory to have a point of maximal expansion which results in increasing the measure of non - inflating trajectories . in a famous angular parametrization described below this measure",
    "is about @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "hence , the sign of the spatial curvature , which is rapidly `` forgotten '' after the inflationary regime established , is very important during a possible pre - inflationary period .",
    "another important characteristic of the pre - inflationary era which is also  forgotten \" during inflation is the possible presence of a hydrodynamical matter in addition to the scalar field .",
    "decreasing even more rapidly than the curvature with increasing scale factor @xmath2 , the energy density of hydrodynamical matter could not affect the slow - rolling conditions and so has a tiny effect on the dynamics if the spatial curvature is non - positive .",
    "however , the conditions for extrema of @xmath2 can change significantly in a closed model , so this model requires special analysis .",
    "it was done in @xcite where the maximum measure of non - inflationary trajectories in the angular parametrization is found to be @xmath8 with the significant dependence of this measure on the density of hydrodynamical matter .    in recent years some interesting modification of standard scenario become the matter of investigations .",
    "after a famous paper of randall and sundrum @xcite a lot of effort was done on the idea that our universe is a boundary ( brane ) of a manifold with a larger dimensions ( bulk ) .",
    "inflation caused by a massive scalar field on the brane in the case of flat frw brane metric was considered in @xcite .",
    "one of the principal features of the brane scenario is the presence of the so called `` dark radiation '' term in the equations of motion . in the case of frw brane",
    "this term is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the scale factor ( as an ordinary radiation matter ) , so , it rapidly decreases during inflation . on the other hand",
    ", we can expect that this term can alter the conditions for inflation on closed frw brane in a way similar to studied in @xcite .",
    "this problem is the topic of sec.2 of the present paper .",
    "apart from branes , some generalizations of simple scalar field scenario appeared also in the framework of `` standard '' cosmology . in this paper",
    "we will consider one of them , namely a massive complex scalar field .",
    "it is naturally appears in supersymmetry theories .",
    "some problems of quantum cosmology with a complex scalar field were studied in @xcite .",
    "recent proposals to use this type of scalar field to explain dark matter and quintessence were put forward in @xcite .",
    "we will apply our analysis of generality of inflation to the complex scalar field in sec.3 .",
    "the results of studies of these three models - a scalar field with a hydrodynamical matter , a scalar field on the brane and a complex scalar field are compared in sec.4 .",
    "in this section we consider a `` three  brane universe '' in a five dimensional ( bulk ) space - time .",
    "we will consider only purely nonstandard brane dynamics when the matter density on the brane dominates the brane tension .",
    "then the equations describing the cosmological evolution of a closed frw brane are  @xcite @xmath9    here @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the 5-dimensional fundamental planck mass which can differ significantly from 4-dimensional planck mass observing on the brane . for a review of the current status of the brane model see , for example @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for a brane universe with a massive scalar field have the form    @xmath12    @xmath13    with a constraint @xmath14    the equations of motion in brane scenario in comparison with those in standard cosmology characterizes by quadratic dependence on energy - momentum tensor and nonlocal effects from the free gravitational field in the bulk , manifesting itself in the presence of a `` dark radiation '' term ( the last term in righthand side of eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the inflationary dynamics on the brane for the flat brane metric was considered in ref .",
    "the situation appears to be not so different from the standard case , though the slow - roll regime is changed . the slow - roll condition being @xmath15 in standard cosmology takes the form @xmath16 in the brane model and , hence , the measure of non - inflationary initial conditions is @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 in standard scenario .",
    "our goal here is to study the positive curvature case .",
    "first we need to specify a set of initial conditions .",
    "it is common to use the hypersurface with the energy density equal to the planck one ( called the planck boundary ) as the initial - condition space .",
    "as was pointed out in ref.@xcite this choice is based on the physical considerations of inapplicability of classical gravity beyond the planck boundary and of the absence of any information from this region .",
    "we remind the reader that in the brane scenario the fundamental planck scale limiting the applications of classical gravity is different from the effective planck scale on the brane .    to compare our results with those obtained in the standard scenario , we rewrite the constraint equation so that the coefficient in the lefthand side be the same :",
    "@xmath19    now , we start from the planck boundary : @xmath20    to describe the initial data on the planck boundary it is useful to introduce two dimensionless variables , as in @xcite",
    ". one of them is the angular parameter @xmath21 defined as    @xmath22    and the second one is @xmath23 .",
    "a couple @xmath24 determine the initial point on the planck boundary completely .",
    "the variable @xmath25 can vary in a compact region from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ; the corresponding initial values of the scale factor @xmath2 varies from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "initial data below the horizontal line in fig.1(f ) are physically inadmissible .    the numerical calculation results are plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the region where inflation is possible is the gray one .",
    "the resulting measure of initial data leading to inflation as a function of @xmath30 is plotted in fig.2 .",
    "though this measure does not change drastically , the configuration of corresponding regions in initial condition space shown in fig.1 undergoes substantial transformation .",
    "in particular , for large enough @xmath30 inflation becomes impossible if the value of initial hubble parameter @xmath31 is less than some critical one ( or , equivalently , initial spatial curvature is greater than some critical value ) .",
    "we can easily find analytically the minimal value of @xmath30 when this situation takes place , i.e. when there are no inflation with initial @xmath32 . to do this we remark from eq.(4 ) that if we start with some initial energy @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( i.e. in the extremum of @xmath2 ) , then possible initial @xmath35 lie in the interval @xmath36 where initial scale factor @xmath37 .    from the other side ,",
    "the direction of trajectory in the extremum of @xmath2 depends on the sign of the second derivative @xmath38 . substituting @xmath39 into eq .",
    "( 3 ) and expressing @xmath40 from the constraint equation ( 4 ) , we obtain that @xmath38 at the point @xmath39 is @xmath41    we can see that for initial @xmath32 , @xmath42 ( universe collapses directly from the initial point ) when @xmath43    the intervals ( 8) and ( 10 ) coincide at the critical value of initial scale factor @xmath44 .",
    "it means that if we start from the planck boundary , then for @xmath45 ( in this case",
    "@xmath46 ) all trajectories with @xmath32 go to singularity directly from the initial point and can not reach inflation .",
    "for @xmath47 it is impossible to reach inflation from some high - curvature initial data independently on the initial @xmath21 .",
    "the curve ( 8) does not exist for @xmath48 . if initial @xmath2 corresponding to a given initial @xmath25 is less than this value then it is impossible to find any @xmath21 , such that the total energy of the system ( `` dark radiation '' plus the scalar field ) does not exceed the planck energy .",
    "the planck boundary is now only part of the initial rectangular area in the coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath21 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "this situation occurs if @xmath49 . the ratio of non - inflation trajectories reaches its maximum at @xmath50 ( the maximum value of this ratio is @xmath51 ) and steadily decreases for larger @xmath30 .",
    "we also checked numerically , that another choices of initial energy @xmath33 lead to qualitatively the same picture with appropriate rescaling of the parameter @xmath30 .    a negative @xmath30 ( fig.1(a ) )",
    "does not change the situation significantly in comparison with the case @xmath52 ( fig.1(b ) ) .",
    "the results for positive @xmath30 are similar to those received in  @xcite where the degree of generality of inflation in ordinary frw universe with massive scalar field and hydrodynamical matter is analyzed .",
    "it is natural , since the @xmath30-containing term behaves exactly as a hydrodynamical matter with the equation of state @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we return to standard frw cosmology but consider a more complicated version of the scalar field , namely , the massive complex scalar field .",
    "the action for this model is @xmath54    and now the planck mass @xmath55 has its common sense .",
    "we will use a suitable representation of the complex scalar field @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is absolute value of the complex scalar field and @xmath58 is its phase .    using this representation",
    "we can see that the phase variable @xmath58 is cyclical and its conjugate momentum @xmath59 is conserved .",
    "we call it as a `` charge '' of the universe @xmath60 : @xmath61    expressing the phase @xmath62 through the charge @xmath63 we can get the following equations of motion @xcite : @xmath64    @xmath65    besides we can write down the first integral :    @xmath66    for future use we also find a curve , separating possible maxima and minima of the scale factor . following the same procedure , as in the previous section we can express @xmath67 from the constraint ( 15 ) and substitute it in eq .",
    "this equation gives now for @xmath39    @xmath68    so , the separating curve is @xmath69 and does not depend on the charge @xmath63 @xcite .      as in the previous section , we start from the planck boundary @xmath70    then it is necessary to introduce a measure on the initial condition space .",
    "we remind the reader that in the case of a real scalar field the usual way to parameterize the planck boundary is to introduce two dimensionless variables , @xmath71 and @xmath21 via the angular parametrization , which in standard cosmology has the form    @xmath72    however , in our case we have additional term in the left part of ( 18 ) , so we can not use this way . instead",
    ", the second dimensionless coordinate we chose as @xmath73 .    two variables , @xmath25 and @xmath74 , completely determine initial conditions on the planck boundary .",
    "we can see from eq.(15 ) that possible initial @xmath74 for a given @xmath25 lie in the interval @xmath75 $ ] , where    @xmath76    @xmath77 the variable @xmath25 as in the previous section varies from @xmath26 to @xmath78",
    ".    numerically found initial conditions leading to inflation for a real scalar field ( @xmath79 ) in the coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath80 are shown in fig .",
    "the measure of non - inflating trajectories is equal to @xmath81 .",
    "the difference between this value and @xmath82 found in @xcite arises completely from differences in chosen measures . with growing @xmath63",
    "the picture experiences changes similar to the case studied in the previous section .",
    "if we start with zero @xmath25 and some initial @xmath2 , the maximum and minimum values of the scalar field @xmath83 lie on the curve @xmath84    the separating curve is given by eq .",
    "( 17 ) and crosses the curve ( 19 ) at    @xmath85    remembering that the initial value of the scale factor , corresponding to @xmath32 on the planck boundary is @xmath86 , we find that for @xmath87 all trajectories with @xmath32 fall into a singularity . for @xmath88",
    "there is a high - curvature region with no way to reach inflation ( fig.3(c ) ) .",
    "as in the previous section , there exists some value of charge for which start from @xmath32 becomes impossible .",
    "it happens if @xmath63 exceeds @xmath89 ( fig.3(d ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see , that these values are rather close to each other :    @xmath90    as @xmath91 and @xmath92 depend on @xmath4 , this dependence appears also in the curve @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the measure of inflationary solutions .",
    "an example for @xmath95 is plotted in fig.4 . for another @xmath96",
    "this curve is similar with rescaling @xmath97 .",
    "in the present paper we have considered two particular examples of a scalar field dynamics on the closed frw background . together with the model of a massive scalar field with a hydrodynamical matter studied in @xcite these cases , arising from rather different physical models , show several common features .",
    "first of all , the measure of initial conditions leading to inflation remains large enough , not falling below @xmath98 .",
    "if we consider a detailed structure of initial conditions for recollapsing universes , we find that depending on the parameter of the model ( which can be a charge , a `` dark radiation '' density or a density of a hydrodynamical matter ) there are two situation possible .",
    "for small values of the parameter inflation can start from an arbitrary large initial curvatures , or , equivalently , arbitrary small initial scale factors ( of course , within the planck limit ) .",
    "for the parameter bigger than the critical one all trajectories from the high - curvature initial data go back to a singularity instead of inflation .",
    "these critical values are @xmath99 for a `` dark radiation '' in the brane model and @xmath100 for a charge . in the case of the massive scalar field with a perfect fluid which has the equation of state @xmath101 we can introduce a constant parameter @xmath102 which is related to energy density @xmath103 as @xmath104 . in this case @xmath105 , where @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "there is also the second critical value of the parameter which is equal to @xmath107 for the `` dark radiation '' , @xmath108 for the charge and @xmath109 for the perfect fluid density ( the latter value is taken from @xcite ) . for bigger value of the parameter",
    "the planck boundary covers only a part of the initial rectangular .",
    "the coordinate @xmath25 varies in the interval @xmath110 with some nonzero @xmath111 , corresponding to some minimal possible initial scale factor @xmath2 .",
    "smaller initial @xmath25 would correspond to smaller initial @xmath2 and the energy density in `` dark radiation '' , charge or matter terms would exceed the planck energy which makes these initial conditions physically inadmissible .",
    "numerical data show also that if the parameter exceeds the second critical value the described above range of initial @xmath25 not leading to inflation independently on the second coordinate continues to exist ( see fig.1(f ) ) , though being narrower with increasing value of the parameter .    looking on the overall measure of the initial condition allowing inflation",
    "we can see also a remarkable difference between the brane scenario ( fig.2 ) and the complex scalar field ( fig.4 ) . in the former case this measure decreases significantly with increasing @xmath30 up to the second critical value @xmath112 , though in the latter case the measure is almost monotonically increasing function of @xmath63 . in the model of scalar field with a perfect fluid ,",
    "studied earlier , the situation is similar to the brane case .",
    "however , this difference mostly appears because of the different choice of the measure .",
    "we remind the reader that in the brane scenario and the perfect fluid case we use the angular parametrization of the initial condition space , and in the complex scalar field case the value @xmath113 is chosen for the second coordinate ( the first coordinate , @xmath25 , is the same in all three cases ) .",
    "it is possible to use the latter measure for another cases under consideration .",
    "the results are presented in fig.5 . for the model with a perfect fluid",
    "we can see a very small decrease ( about @xmath114 ) of the measure in comparison with about @xmath115 times drop of the measure in the angular parametrization . in the brane scenario we can see a rather small decreasing of the measure with the minimum at @xmath116 . in this point",
    "the measure is @xmath117 of the value at @xmath52 in comparison with about @xmath118 times drop in the angular parametrization .",
    "this difference can be easily understood by comparing of these two parametrizations of the planck boundary .",
    "the important feature of the angular parametrizations is that independently on the possible initial @xmath25 on the planck boundary the second coordinate @xmath21 can vary in the same range @xmath119 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the possible range for @xmath120 ( or @xmath113 for the complex scalar field ) steadily decreases with increase of the initial curvature ( see eq.(8 ) ) .",
    "so , the high - curvature initial data , less favorable for inflation give bigger contribution for the measure based on the angular parametrizations than for the measure based on @xmath120 as the second coordinate",
    ".    for parameter bigger than the second critical one the map from one measure to another becomes even discontinuous .",
    "the line @xmath121 $ ] in fig.1(f ) ( consisting only on non - inflationary trajectories ) maps into a single point ( compare fig.1(f ) and fig.3(d ) ) .",
    "so , a definitely nonmonotonic behavior of the measure of inflationary trajectories as a function of the parameter of the model in the case of the angular parametrizations of the planck boundary can be explained as a measure effect .",
