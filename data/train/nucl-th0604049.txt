    "recently , exotic nuclear systems involving a @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) as a constituent have been predicted based on phenomenologically constructed @xmath12 interactions @xcite .",
    "the predicted bound states in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath10@xmath15be with large binding energies lie below the @xmath16 emission threshold , and thus are expected to have narrow decay widths . because of the strong @xmath12 attraction they have enormously high nucleon densities , @xmath17 @xmath18 , about 3 times the normal nuclear density @xmath19 @xmath18 .",
    "such compact nuclear systems , which can be called ",

    "the basic ingredient for this new family of nuclear states is @xmath20 , which is identified as the known @xmath21 ( hereafter , expressed as @xmath22 ) with a binding energy of @xmath23 = 27 mev and a width of @xmath24 = 40 mev .",
    "the lightest system is @xmath6 ( and its isospin partner @xmath25 ) , which was predicted to have @xmath23 = 48 mev and @xmath24 = 61 mev @xcite .",

    "a method to determine the sizes of the @xmath9 clusters via the momentum correlation of decay particles has been proposed @xcite .    the conventional methods to produce kaonic bound states are to use strangeness - transfer reactions of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the formation of @xmath9 clusters can be treated by a @xmath22 doorway model @xcite , in which a @xmath40 produced in elementary processes , typically , @xmath41 merges with a surrounding nucleon ( or nucleus ) to become a @xmath9 state .",

    "we study the possibility to make use of the elementary process , @xmath44[eq : pp ] in connection with an experiment proposal at gsi using the fopi detector @xcite .",
    "since the momentum transfer in this associated production of @xmath22 is very large ( @xmath45 1.6 gev/@xmath3 ) , one would expect that the formation cross section of @xmath9 clusters must be very small .",

    "the energy spectrum involving both the bound and unbound regions was calculated following the morimatsu - yazaki procedure @xcite .",

    "the calculated wavefunction of @xmath28 yields @xmath103 1.05 fm .",
    "the momentum transfer in the reaction is @xmath100 = 1.6 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "the boson mass in producing @xmath22 in @xmath58 collision is taken to be the @xmath104 meson mass ; @xmath105 mev/@xmath106 .",
    "the calculated spectral functions ( forward cross sections ) at @xmath107 = 4 gev are presented in the scale of @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pik - pp - combined ] ( lower - right ) .",
    "the cross section integrated over the quasi - free region ( @xmath109 ) corresponds to the free emission of @xmath22 , which is known to have an empirical cross section of @xmath110 20 @xmath111b from a disto experiment at @xmath107 = 2.85 gev @xcite .",
    "so , we have adjusted our absolute cross sections so as to give this empirical cross section .",
    "surprisingly , in great contrast to the ordinary cases , the spectral function is peaked at the bound state with a very small quasi - free component .",
    "this dominance of @xmath7 sticking in such a large-@xmath100 reaction can be understood as originating from the matching of the small impact parameter with the small size of the bound state . for further understanding of the mechanism we examined the dependence of the spectral function by changing the essential parameters fictitiously .",
    "[ fig : s(e)-parameters ] ( upper ) shows that the bound - state peak decreases dramatically , when we increase the rms size @xmath102 from 1.05 fm ( the predicted size of the dense @xmath112 ) to 1.46 and 2.33 fm .",
    "it also shows that with a denser system ( @xmath102 = 0.93 and 0.80 fm ) the peak height increases .",
    "so , the dominant sticking of @xmath7 is the result of the dense @xmath9 system to be formed .",
    "we also showed that with a fictitiously long - range @xmath66 collision ( @xmath79 = 10 mev ) the bound - state peak diminishes and the quasi - free component dominates . under this condition",
    "the bound - state peak is enhanced only when the momentum transfer is small ( so called recoilless condition ) .",
    "on the other hand , the dominant sticking of @xmath7 is assisted by the large momentum transfer ( @xmath113 1.6 gev/@xmath3 ) .    as a more analytical way to show the physics behind we plot the radial dependence of each factor of the transition intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - amplitude ] .",
    "the first row shows the @xmath114 interaction range of the yukawa type with different boson mass @xmath79 .",
    "the second row shows the spherical bessel function @xmath115 corresponding to the momentum transfer of @xmath116 1.6 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "these two functions have values mostly for @xmath117 0.3 fm .",
    "the third row shows the structure dependent function @xmath101 , where the solid and broken curves represent the bound ( @xmath118 -62 mev ) and the quasi - free ( @xmath119 = 100 mev ) cases , respectively .",
    "finally , the bottom row shows the radial dependences of the spectral strengths at the bound - state ( b ) and the quasi - free ( qf ) regions . in the realistic case ,",
    "column ( a ) , the structure function is dense below @xmath102 = 1.05 fm so that it overlaps with the short range interaction assisted by the large momentum transfer .",
    "the bound / qf ratio is 4.6 .",
    "if we artificially increase the @xmath86 distance to 2.33 fm ( a deuteron like distance ) , as shown in column ( b ) the overlap drops down so that the ratio becomes 0.7 .",
    "as far as the momentum transfer is large , a softened interaction ( @xmath120 140 mev ) , case ( c ) , does not change the bound / qf ratio from the realistic case ( a ) .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that the dominant sticking of @xmath7 occurs as a joint effect of the short - range collision , the large momentum transfer and the compact size of the @xmath9 cluster .",
    "it is vitally important to examine our results experimentally .",
    "an experimental observation of @xmath28 in @xmath58 collision will not only confirm the existence of @xmath28 , but also proves the compactness of the @xmath9 cluster .",
    "once a @xmath7 doorway is formed , the @xmath22 can not escape any more as a free particle and thus it is likely to further propagate in a complex nucleus as @xmath121 and ultimately a _ kaonic proton capture _ reaction may occur , such as @xmath122 in principle , missing mass spectra , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , may reveal monoenergetic peaks .",
    "the elementary reaction of type @xmath126 was studied experimentally by the disto group at saturne @xcite and more recently by the anke group at cosy @xcite . the disto experiment identified @xmath48 from the invariant - mass spectrum of @xmath127 and constructed a missing mass spectrum of @xmath128 from those events involving @xmath48 at an incident proton energy of @xmath107 = 2.85 gev .",
    "the missing mass in this case is equal to the mass of @xmath129 , @xmath130 and they found peaks associated with the production of @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "they obtained a cross section of 20 @xmath111b for @xmath21 , which we used as an absolute scale in our calculations .",
    "the anke experiment measured the energies and momenta of four emitted particles , @xmath134 , @xmath26 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , with complete kinematical constraint at @xmath107 = 2.83 gev : @xmath137 they constructed @xmath138 and additionally @xmath139 , which was equated to @xmath140 .",
    "when @xmath141 , it indicates that this @xmath129 decays to @xmath127 , and thus , it is assigned to be @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the anke @xmath138 spectrum is equivalent to the disto spectrum .",
    "so far , the reaction products were studied in terms of the elementary processes .",
    "now , we propose to examine the new situation related to the existence of @xmath28 .",
    "we point out that the formation / decay process of this object , as given in eq.([eq : pp2klp ] ) and ( [ eq : pp2kpp - decay-1],[eq : pp2kpp - decay-2],[eq : pp2kpp - decay-3 ] ) , are hidden in the observed spectra of @xmath138 .",
    "the most important information is contained in a spectrum of @xmath123 , which is related to the mass of @xmath28 , @xmath142 but no such spectrum has been obtained .",
    "presumably , the limited detector acceptance may not allow to reach the mass range of the present concern ( @xmath143 mev/@xmath106 ) .",
    "now , a new experiment of the fopi group at gsi , which is aimed at measuring the whole products in the @xmath74 reaction at @xmath107 = 3.5 gev to reconstruct both the invariant mass @xmath144 and @xmath123 , is in progress .",
    "the fopi group is also studying the @xmath145 process , which may lead to the formation of @xmath13 cluster .",
    "in this note we have shown that the basic @xmath9 cluster , @xmath6 , as a dissolved state of @xmath146 can be formed with extraordinarily large enhancement , since the @xmath22 produced in a short - range collision with the participating proton automatically forms a @xmath7 doorway toward a dense @xmath6 system .",
    "this anomalous dominance of @xmath7 sticking results from the unusual matching of the short collision range ( @xmath147 0.3 fm ) and the small radius of the produced @xmath28 ( @xmath148 1.0 fm ) , assisted by a large momentum transfer .",
    "experimental confirmation of this effect will automatically proves the dense character of @xmath9 clusters .    finally , we comment on our earlier proposal to make use of hot fireball in heavy - ion collisions as sources of various @xmath9 clusters @xcite . if the formation of @xmath7 doorway toward @xmath6 is really enhanced in the @xmath66 collisions , the @xmath9 cluster formation in heavy - ion reactions",
    "is expected to be enhanced as well , since a heavy - ion reaction involves lots of primary @xmath66 collisions and subsequent processes .",
