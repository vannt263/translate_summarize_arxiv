    "however , before doing that , let us first give a brief motivation for considering such geometries . under what circumstances can such geometries arise , and what might be their use in physical theories ? over the past several decades , it has been realized ( although not widely appreciated ) that the geometry relevant for describing matter in presence of gravitational field could be related to the spacetime geometry in a non - trivial manner , going beyond the well known relation based on _ conformal transformations _ which have otherwise been ubiquitous in such contexts . a very transparent presentation of this argument can be found , for example , in bekenstein s paper @xcite .",

    "finsler _ , rather than _ riemannian _ , geometry as more fundamental , and imposes some physically motivated constraints , a finsler geometry can be re - cast in terms of a riemannian geometry with a metric that is related to the spacetime metric by transformations which are non - conformal . since the transformation in ( [ eq : qmetric ] ) is qualitatively of such form ( although differs in detail from the ones in @xcite ) , we refer to such geometries as  finsler_esque _ \" , and shall be working throughout this paper in this restricted context .",
