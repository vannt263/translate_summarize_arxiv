    "decoherence is one of the main obstacles for building useful quantum devices .",
    "understanding the mechanisms of decoherence and achieving long decoherence times is crucial for many fields of science and applications including quantum computation and quantum information @xcite , protein dynamics @xcite , dynamics of excitons and charge separation in biological complexes @xcite , and the new and rapidly growing fields of nmr and mri with ultra small ( microtesla ) magnetic fields @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the larmor frequencies of the spin precession become relatively small ( in the khz region ) , causing the effects of @xmath0 noise become so important that noise suppression must be used .    in many situations",

    ", we study relaxation and dephasing processes using a spin - fluctuator model @xcite . in the spin - fluctuator model , fluctuations are described by a random telegraph process ( rtp ) produced by @xmath1 fluctuators .",
    "each fluctuator is characterized by two parameters : its amplitude and switching rate . depending on the distribution function of fluctuators over amplitudes and switching rates , the rtp can describe noise for a broad range of frequencies using spectral characteristics that include both low- and high - frequencies noise .",

    "we study two approximations in which these equations are reduced to a system of differential equations .",
    "the first one we call the gaussian approximation , because , as we demonstrate , in the simplest case of a two - level system ( qubit ) under the influence of an erp , it yields the relation : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the random angle of the bloch vector .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of dephasing in a quantum two - level system by modeling both @xmath0 and high - frequency noise by random telegraph processes . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on a so - called spin - fluctuator model in which a noisy environment is modeled by a large number of fluctuators . in the continuous limit </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an effective random process ( erp ) that is described by a distribution function of the fluctuators . in a simplified model , </S>",
    "<S> we reduce the erp to the two ( slow and fast ) ensembles of fluctuators . using this model , we study decoherence in a superconducting flux qubit and we compare our theoretical results with the available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate good agreement of our theoretical predictions with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our approach can be applied to many quantum systems , such as biological complexes , semiconductors , superconducting and spin qubits , where the effects of interaction with the environment are essential . </S>"
