    "recent studies have shown that not all stars within the milky way are bound to the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite defines genuine hypervelocity stars as those that  will escape the gravitational potential of our galaxy . \"",
    "stellar escape velocity is a function of galactic position .",
    "the escape velocity threshold is @xmath3400  km  s@xmath0 in the halo @xcite , whereas the current measured escape velocity threshold near the sun is about @xmath4  km  s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hypervelocity stars are important , because they , unlike the vast majority of stars in the galaxy , are not bound .",
    "one or more mechanisms are thus required to explain their hypervelocity origins .",
    "stars may reach hypervelocity speeds , as predicted by @xcite , through a gravitational interaction between a binary system and the central massive black hole ( cmbh ) , in which one of the stars is ejected from the galaxy while the other is captured into orbit around the cmbh .",
    "the hypervelocity stars studied by @xcite and @xcite have kinematics that are consistent with ejection radially outward from the galactic center .",
    "alternative mechanisms may be responsible for observed high galactocentric ( gc ) stellar velocities .",
    "@xcite studied the main - sequence b - type star he 04375439 , whose velocity is at least 563  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite showed that if he 04375439 has a gc origin , then its flight time from the center to its current location would be @xmath3100  myr , about four times longer than its age on the main sequence .",
    "@xcite thus proposed a solution that this star is a blue straggler , a blue main - sequence star ( such as b type ) that persists in clusters beyond the turn - off point of the cluster .",
    "@xcite suggested that such stars may come into existence through the merger of two lower - mass stars .",
    "a related merger - type event between two helium white dwarfs has been proposed to explain the presence of the hypervelocity , subluminous o - type star us 708 @xcite , in the galactic halo , with a reported gc velocity of @xmath5  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "a more - recent study proposed that the energy of a supernova propelled us 708 outward @xcite and reported an updated gc velocity of @xmath6  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite presented a sample of 20 g and k hypervelocity candidates whose kinematics were inconsistent with a cmbh ejection scenario . with the aid of improved proper motion measurements , @xcite dismissed a cmbh ejection scenario for 14 of these stars and concluded that they are likely disk runaways .",
    "while o and b stars may remain on the main sequence for @xmath310@xmath7  yr , the lowest - mass m dwarfs may remain on the main sequence for @xmath310@xmath8  yr @xcite . as m dwarfs ( dms ) comprise @xmath370% of the stars in the milky way , they are the dominant stellar constituent @xcite .",
    "thus , depending on the mechanism that accelerates these stars to hypervelocities , one might expect to find more hypervelocity m dwarfs than hypervelocity o or b stars . in the last few years , several new studies of hypervelocity candidates later than b - type stars have been published .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite present hypervelocity candidates of stars as late as k type .",
    "however , very few m type hypervelocity stars have been observed to date . @xcite present 18 hypervelocity candidates ranging in types from f to m. in addition , @xcite includes 14 new hypervelocity m subdwarf candidates with gc velocities exceeding 525  km  s@xmath0 . @xcite",
    "also present a sample of hypervelocity m dwarf candidates .",
    "the primary challenge when observing m dwarfs is their intrinsic faintness , which presents a major limitation for detecting and studying hypervelocity stars . along the main sequence ,",
    "b - type stars are @xmath9 times more luminous than m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the low luminosity of m dwarfs also makes spectral and proper motion analysis of m dwarfs particularly challenging .",
    "the discovery of runaway m dwarfs would thus provide a significant contribution to the population of identified runaway stars and opens up the possibility of finding hypervelocity m dwarfs . a larger sample of m dwarfs is needed to identify more potential hypervelocity candidates .",
    "the spectroscopic catalog of @xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter w11 ) consists of 70,841 visually inspected m dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) data release 7 ( dr7 , @xcite ) .",
    "the kinematic data from the w11 catalog thus present an ideal starting point for identifying new hypervelocity candidates .    in this paper",
    ", we present a sample of runaway m dwarf candidates ( rdms ) from the w11 catalog .",
    "we discuss the process by which we create a high - quality sample of rdm candidates in section [ section : data ] .",
    "we present the stellar properties of our rdms and determine the probabilities for each of our rdms to be bound or unbound in section [ section : results ] .",
    "we discuss selection effects and possible acceleration mechanisms for our rdms in section [ section : discussion ] .",
    "we summarize our paper in section [ section : summary ] .",
    "the stars in w11 were inspected using the hammer spectral typing facility @xcite to determine spectral types and ensure that extragalactic interlopers were excluded . stars were included only if they had @xmath10 at @xmath38300   .",
    "proper motions of the stars in w11 were extracted from the sdss+usno - b proper motion catalog @xcite .",
    "distances were calculated using the photometric parallax relation between @xmath11 and the extinction - corrected @xmath12 color of the star @xcite .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities ( rvs ) were determined by cross - correlating each spectrum with a template for that subtype , yielding typical precisions of 710  km  s@xmath0 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b07b ) .",
    "the m dwarfs in the w11 catalog were categorized based on whether they passed a set of processing flags , described below .",
    "proper motions are essential in measuring the tangential velocities ( tvs ) of m dwarfs . the hypervelocity o and b - type stars previously studied are mostly rv validated , whereas nearby rdms can have high rvs , high proper motions , or both .",
    "proper motions for stars in the w11 catalog were pulled from the proper motion catalog of @xcite .",
    "we adopted a set of clean proper motion flags established by @xcite , which enabled large , statistically complete samples of white dwarfs from sdss .",
    "several of their processing flags include : ` match ` , the number of objects in usno - b which match an sdss object in a 1 \" radius ; ` sigra ` & ` sigdec ` , the residuals in the linear fit ( based on all epochs at which the object was observed ) of right ascension and declination proper motions ; ` nfit ` , the number of detections between sdss and usno - b used in the fit , with a maximum of 6 ; and ` dist22 ` , the angle ( in arcsec ) to the nearest neighbor in sdss with @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution of proper motion errors in @xcite , who required ` match ` @xmath14 , ` sigra ` & ` sigdec ` @xmath15 , and ` nfit ` @xmath16 , can be assessed by examining the proper motions of quasars .",
    "@xcite state that  objects detected on fewer than four plates in usno - b suffer from a large contamination by false matches . \"",
    "according to @xcite , contamination in the sample can be reduced by requiring ` match ` @xmath14 , ` sigra ` & ` sigdec ` @xmath17 ( the condition for the residuals is relaxed ) , ` nfit ` @xmath18 , and ` dist22 ` @xmath19 .",
    "the condition ` nfit ` @xmath18 , according to @xcite ,  makes the cleanness of our samples much better than that of samples defined using the standard criteria defined by @xcite , even when we loosen the requirement on rms fitting residuals a little bit . \" for comparison , the processing flags adopted by w11 include : ` goodphot ` , which equals 1 if the distances are defined by the photometry and have measured magnitudes , 0 otherwise ; ` goodpm ` , which equals 1 if the proper motions satisfy the conditions ` match ` @xmath14 , ` dist22 ` @xmath20 , ` sigra ` & ` sigdec ` @xmath21 , and ( ` nfit ` @xmath18 or ( ` nfit ` @xmath22 and ( o @xmath23 or j @xmath23 ) ) ) @xcite , 0 otherwise ( see footnote 13 in @xcite ) ; and ` wdm ` , which equals 1 for a possible white dwarf - m dwarf pair , 0 otherwise .    proper motions in the sdss+usno - b catalog combine relative proper motions from observations taken on usno - b plates with sdss ccd photometry .",
    "stellar proper motions are also recorded in other catalogs , such as the positions and proper motions catalog ( ppmxl @xcite ) , the lpine shara proper motion catalog ( lspm , @xcite ) , which was inspected by eye , and the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , @xcite ) , which is tied to the international coordinate reference system ( icrs ) through the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the proper motion error distribution of the sdss+usno - b catalog using quasars , as they have extragalactic distances and so are expected to exhibit no observable proper motion . using the 10@xmath24 release of the sdss quasar catalog @xcite , @xcite found that the proper motion errors of quasars are well represented by a distribution consisting of a gaussian core with extended wings .",
    "the catalog by @xcite ( submitted ) established updated proper motions for @xmath25 kml stars from a combination of sdss , _ wise _ , and 2mass baselines .",
    "the choice to adopt a baseline depended on whether or not each source passed a set of processing flags . within their catalog , processing flags from among the sdss ,",
    "_ wise _ , and 2mass catalogs were applied to the sdss quasar catalog to define a set of qsos .",
    "these were used to compute angular distances between catalog baselines and provide updated proper motion errors for kml stars , depending on the number of observation epochs for that star .",
    "data are taken from the w11 spectroscopic catalog , which consists of 70,841 visually inspected m dwarfs from the sdss @xcite dr7 @xcite .",
    "the proper motions in the w11 catalog are based on @xcite , which omits proper motions @xmath26  mas  yr@xmath0 .",
    "we thus retrieved proper motions for 47 high proper motion stars using the @xcite ( submitted ) catalog , in which combinations of sdss , _ wise _ , and 2mass baselines determined updated proper motions for these rdm candidates .",
    "magnitudes in w11 are extinction - corrected using the method of @xcite .",
    "these corrections rely on column densities calculated from 100 and 240  @xmath27 m galactic emission along the line - of - sight out to infinity , and therefore may overestimate the true extinction to nearby stars .",
    "@xcite provides a more robust galactic extinction map by fitting extinction curves to the fluxes of @xmath356,000 m dwarfs in the spectral range 57009200   from the w11 catalog .",
    "we correct for extinction using the method of @xcite , except for m dwarfs not present in the @xcite catalog , where we apply the extinction corrections of @xcite .",
    "extinction corrections from the @xcite catalog were available for 57,067 stars .",
    "the mean extinction correction for our final sample is 0.18 magnitudes .",
    "given that the mean apparent magnitude of our sample is @xmath28 , and the mean distance from the sun is 686  pc , our stellar distances would have been offset by @xmath38.6% if extinction corrections using either catalog are neglected .",
    "most of our other uncertainties ( e.g. , metallicity , spread in the photometric parallax relationship ) , are typically larger than this , so the effect of extinction on distance is minimal in comparison .      because trigonometric parallaxes are not available for many faint stars , such as m dwarfs , alternate relations must be employed .",
    "@xcite derived a photometric parallax relation between @xmath11 and the extinction - corrected @xmath12 color of the star . given two different filters , the color of a star determines its distance in a particular band @xmath29 using the distance modulus relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance , @xmath32 is the apparent magnitude in one filter , @xmath33 is the color from two filters , and @xmath34 is the absolute magnitude , which is a function of the color . using a sample of nearby stars with known absolute magnitudes derived from trigonometric parallax relations , @xcite derived the photometric parallax relation @xmath35 and the residual rms scatter in the relation is 0.394 .",
    "distances in the w11 catalog were calculated using this photometric parallax relation .    as first described by @xcite , lower - metallicity stars will have higher surface temperatures and thus higher luminosities than higher - metallicity stars of the same mass .",
    "corrections to the absolute magnitude may be derived using iron abundance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as @xcite demonstrate , the photometric parallax relation must be modified for the lower metallicity classes ( subdwarfs , extreme subdwarfs , and ultra subdwarfs ) . by taking metallicity into account , which we do in this study ,",
    "the distance uncertainties are actually reduced .",
    "however , precise metallicities for many m subdwarfs have not been measured , and instead proxies for metallicities have been developed to establish metallicity classes .",
    "these classes are parameterized by the metallicity - dependent quantity @xmath36 , which is a relation between the cah and tio molecular indices @xcite .",
    "the indices upon which @xmath36 are based have been employed as temperature and metallicity indicators for low - mass stars ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is calibrated over spectral types m0m3 , but suffers from large spreads near solar metallicity @xcite . @xcite classified stars as subdwarfs , extreme subdwarfs , and ultra subdwarfs , for @xmath36 in the ranges @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and less than 0.2 , respectively .    for stars with @xmath39 ( dwarfs )",
    ", we use the photometric parallax relation of @xcite , which provides distance uncertainties of @xmath320% due to scatter along the main sequence .",
    "this is a conservative estimate , since no metallicity information was used to derive the photometric parallax relation . for stars of lower metallicity classes , we adopt empirical models of @xmath11 vs. @xmath12 using the results of @xcite",
    "specifically , we adopt the models in figure 4a of @xcite , which presents separate empirical fits for subdwarfs , extreme subdwarfs , and ultra subdwarfs .",

    "simulations of dynamical heating predict typical @xmath46 dispersions of @xmath433  km  s@xmath0 for m dwarfs ( see figure 6 of @xcite and figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , these studies do not target hypervelocity star candidates , and so we do not quantify whether such models may be generalized to explain the high velocity dispersions in our sample .      to examine the extent to which the rdms share a gc origin , we calculate the absolute difference in the angle between the gc position vector in the @xmath434 coordinate system and the gc velocity vector , @xmath203 ( defined in section [ subsection : properties ] ) . in figure",
    "[ figure : angdifgcpavaplot ] , we plot , for each rdm , the absolute difference ( axis label @xmath435 ) between the gc position angle and @xmath203 , with @xmath404 error bars calculated using the procedure in appendix  [ section : uncertaintyingcrhatdotgcvhat ] .",
    "the values @xmath436 ( @xmath437 ) represent motion directly radially out from ( in toward ) the galactic center . the value @xmath438 represents circular motion around the galactic center .",
    "our rdms , which are all within @xmath31  kpc of the sun , tend not to exhibit circular motion around the galactic center , as exhibited by the absence of rdms with @xmath438 .",
    "figure [ figure : angdifgcpavaplot ] presents a case against a gc origin for about half of our rdms .",
    "the range of possible differences in gc position angle and gc velocity angle rules out the values 0@xmath439 ( radially outward from the galactic center ) and 180@xmath439 ( radially inward toward the galactic center ) to within 1@xmath2 for 12 rdms and 2@xmath2 for 8 rdms .",
    "hence , only about half of our rdms have kinematics consistent with a gc origin .",
    "we note that some rdms may not actually reach the galactic virial radius and instead have turned around .",
    "interestingly , rdms 1 and 2 , which have an inward velocity component , are likely unbound , as established in table [ table : bound ] , yet they are getting _ closer _ to the galactic center . such an observed velocity is inconsistent with an ejection mechanism from the center of the milky way , and so the origin of their high tangential velocities is unlikely to be galactocentric .",
    "other acceleration mechanisms , the origins of which we describe below , may influence an otherwise exclusive gc origin .",
    "one possible alternate ejection mechanism is through a supernova explosion ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , as the energy of the ejection could push the companion star forward . in the supernova ejection scenario pertaining to g and k stars",
    ", @xcite showed that gc velocities up to @xmath3770 and @xmath31280  km  s@xmath0 are possible for these stars , respectively .",
    "such an explosion would also contribute metals to the companion star .",
    "as 16 of our 20 rdms have @xmath39 ( they are dwarfs , rather than a type of subdwarf ) , we can not rule out the possibility that one or more of our rdms may have been accelerated from a supernova .",
    "since abundance measurements for dms are uncertain to @xmath30.2  dex , we do not have any way to probe if the rdms are being enriched given current abundance measurements .",
    "another plausible mechanism for accelerating main - sequence stars is dynamic ejection through multi - body interactions . @xcite",
    "initially determined a maximum ejection rate of 35  myr@xmath0 for old population stars from the galactic center . using a solar - neighborhood survey volume of 265  kpc@xmath440 , @xcite found that ejection rates are even lower for late - type stars and stars with sub - solar metallicities .",
    "our rdm sample is systematically metal - rich and so is at least consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulated the effect of a three - body system consisting of two high mass ( @xmath44180  m@xmath442 ) stars and a flyby star in the mass range 380  m@xmath442 .",
    "according to their simulations ( see figure 4 and figure 9 of @xcite ) , about 1% ( 10% ) of simulations for each of the stars with masses @xmath44320  m@xmath442 had escape velocities exceeding 400  km  s@xmath0 ( 200  km  s@xmath0 ) .    because these simulations include only very high mass stars , which are short - lived and comprise a tiny fraction of the stellar population , the actual probability of observing such a high escape velocity due to interacting contact binaries is low .",
    "@xcite modeled the rate of high - velocity runaways from binaries in dense , compact clusters or cluster cores , with primary star masses @xmath444 .",
    "@xcite showed that the ejection rate of hyper - runways from binaries in dense , compact clusters or cluster cores is on the order of 10 - 20 stars per 100  myr , of which only one or two such stars have @xmath445  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "our survey volume covers about one quarter of the sky out to 1  kpc . on the basis of these analyses ,",
    "it is statistically unlikely that our rdms were accelerated to potentially hypervelocity speeds through a dynamic ejection mechanism .",
    "the kinematics of our sample , as illustrated in figure [ figure : kinematicsplot ] and figure [ figure : angdifgcpavaplot ] , nonetheless show that high tvs dominate the kinematics of the majority of our rdms .",
    "a third plausible mechanism for generating high tangental velocities is through accelerations from nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite proposed that some hypervelocity stars may be accelerated through tidal disruptions of the milky way s dwarf galaxies or gravitational interactions with the cmbh of m31 or m32 .",
    "we briefly consider how plausible these alternative mechanisms may explain the origins of our rdms . @xcite and",
    "@xcite respectively proposed that some hypervelocity stars may be ejected out of m32 and m31 , with higher ejection rates out of m32 .",
    "the predicted space density of m31 hypervelocity stars of all types near the sun is @xmath30.001  kpc@xmath440 . given our survey volume , the probability of discovering a single m31 hypervelocity star , based on its predicted space density near the sun , is low ( @xmath30.1% ) . for comparison",
    ", we observed 20 rdms within our survey volume , so to first order , the probability of any of our rdms coming from m31 is @xmath446 , or @xmath38% .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested that the disruption of tidal dwarf galaxies in the milky way could have produced the stream of hypervelocity stars in the constellation leo ( @xmath447 , @xmath448 ) .",
