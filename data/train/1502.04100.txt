    "s disease ( pd ) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after alzheimer s disease . according to the global declaration for parkinson s disease , 6.3 million people suffer from pd worldwide  @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of pd is about 0.3% of the whole population in industrialized countries , rising up to 1% over the age of 65 and to 4% over 80 .",
    "the clinical picture of pd is characterized by a progressive deterioration of the motor performance , with the occurrence of slowness ( bradykinesia ) and poverty of voluntary movements , expressionless face , `` resting '' tremor , stooped posture , festinating gait , axial instability .",
    "asymmetry of motor symptoms is a typical feature of pd . although the symptoms can be improved by dopaminergic drugs , such as l - dopa , over time its effectiveness worsens and motor fluctuations may occur as well as dyskynesias and involuntary movements .",
    "furthermore , variations in the severity of these symptoms are observed during dosing intervals .",
    "the clinical picture assessed during an outpatient check up in the medical office poorly represents the real ( actual ) clinical status , especially in fluctuating patients . indeed ,",
    "repeated daily assessments of motor symptoms would be required and this is usually done by asking the patient to annotate the number of hours of off ( i.e. , when drugs are not effective ) and on condition ( i.e. , when they are effective ) , but this is not fully reliable due to perceptual bias . for this reason , in recent years a number of studies on automatic systems to evaluate motor fluctuations of pd patients have been developed  @xcite .",
    "the most common approach is leveraging sensing technology to automatically evaluate the performance of specific motor tasks , such as `` sit - to - stand ''  @xcite , gait analysis  @xcite , and tremor  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to develop a system able to get an evaluation of the motor status of a patient as close as possible to the evaluation of neurologists when they apply semi - quantitative evaluation scales , such as the unified parkinson s disease rating scale ( updrs )  @xcite .",
    "although several works have appeared focusing on the evaluation of the performance of specific motor tasks , such as `` sit - to - stand ''  @xcite , gait analysis  @xcite , and tremors  @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , limited attention has been devoted , in the literature , to the evaluation of the leg agility ( la ) task  @xcite .",
    "the la task aims at evaluating the severity of motion impairments of a pd patient , with specific focus on the lower limbs . in this exercise ,",
    "the patient is asked to sit on a chair provided with rigid backrest and armrests .",
    "the patient must place both his / her feet on the floor in a comfortable position .",
    "the exercise consists in alternately raising up and stomping the feet on the ground , as high and as fast as possible .",
    "ten repetitions per leg must be performed while sitting on the chair in order to test each leg separately .",
    "the examiner should first train the patient , showing him / her the correct execution of the exercise , stopping as soon as the patient starts .",
    "the significant parameters that have to be measured , independently for each leg , are the speed , the regularity , and the amplitude of the movement .",
    "moreover , differences can be observed between the movements performed with the different legs . for this reason , in the following we will distinguish between right la ( rla ) and left la ( lla ) tasks .      according to the guidelines of the movement disorder society ( mds )",
    ", the la task must be evaluated observing the following parameters : amplitude , slowing , hesitations , interruptions , and freezing . in particular , in table  [ tab : mappingupdrs ] , an attempt at mapping these parameters with an udprs evaluation is presented .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular , in fig .",
    "[ error_distrib ]  ( a ) the cdfs for all possible combinations of parameters and features are shown using different colors for each classifier .",
    "it can be observed that the choice of the classifier , more than the choice of the features and parameters , is crucial in order to achieve good performance .",
    "indeed , groups of cdfs for each classifier tend to lie in the same portion of the plane even for different features and parameters . to this end , in fig .",
    "[ error_distrib ]  ( b ) the average cdfs ( over all possible combinations of features and parameters ) for each classifier are also shown .",
    "it is easy to observe that best performance can be achieved using @xmath0nn , followed by svm and , eventually , ncc .",
    "note also that performing the analysis on pca data , rather than on original data , does not significantly improve the classifiers performance .",
    "the best combination of features and parameters , chosen as the one which maximize the area under the curve ( auc ) of the cdfs , is resulted to be that which uses @xmath0nn with @xmath1 and ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) as features . in the previous figures , the black solid line represents the corresponding cdf . for completeness , in fig .",
    "[ bestcomb ] , a trajectory , similar to the ones shown in fig  [ amplspeed_pausereg ] , fig .",
    "[ diff ] , and fig .",
    "[ inclpow_angvelpow ] , is drawn in the kinematic space of the best features .",
    "on the same space .",
    "3d points are colored according to the corresponding updrs scores .",
    "centroids of each cluster of points ( drawn as filled stars ) , corresponding to the same updrs score , are shown and are linked in updrs - wise order from 0 to 3.5.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as for the previous bi - dimensional figures , in this case as well a clear trajectory can be identified .",
    "this further confirms the feasibility of the design and implementation of an automatic updrs detection system .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated how kinematic variables , collected through a simple bsn during the la task , can be representative of the updrs value assigned by neurologists .",
    "we have first considered a `` single - subject '' perspective , trying to highlight similarities and differences between characteristic kinematic variables of a healthy subject and of a pd patient .",
    "then , we have carried out a `` large - scale '' experimental investigation considering 24 pd patients .",
    "many kinematic features , in both time and frequency domains , have been investigated , considering various classification methods ( ncc , @xmath0nn , and svm ) .",
    "the most representative ones have been characterized considering two - dimensional ( amplitude - speed and amplitude power - speed power ) and three - dimensional feature spaces ( amplitude - amplitude power - regularity ) . in order to highlight the presence of correlation between the considered kinematic variables ,",
    "a pca has been carried out . however",
    ", our results show that using pca - processed data , rather than original data , does not significantly improve improve the classifiers performance .",
    "the best system configuration , chosen as the one which maximize the auc of the cdfs of the decision error , turned out to be the one based on @xmath0nn with @xmath1 and ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) as features . in particular , characteristic `` trajectories '' ( from low to high updrs scores ) emerge in the considered multi - dimensional kinematic spaces , which is a promising result for the design of an automated updrs detection system which could rely on the introduction of proper `` updrs decision regions '' in the considered kinematic spaces .",
    "last , but not least , the use of a wireless bsn makes the proposed system directly integrable into iot systems , paving the way to telerehabilitation applications and cloud computing - based processing of a large amount of heterogeneous data .",
