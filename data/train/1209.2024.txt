    "understanding the character of the primordial density perturbation has been a chief endeavor of modern precision cosmology .",
    "our knowledge of the shape and statistics of the primordial power spectrum has grown substantially over the past two decades , from the cosmic background explorer s first glimpse of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , to today s swarm of ground - based and balloon - borne cmb and large scale structure observatories .",
    "our knowledge of the primordial density perturbations derives almost exclusively from these data sources  the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background and galaxy correlation measurements  both of which probe large length scales .",
    "these observations have revealed a nearly scale invariant spectrum of gaussian , adiabatic perturbations on comoving scales @xmath7 mpc@xmath8 , in agreement with the simplest models of inflation .",
    "but inflation might not have been so simple .",
    "deviations from gaussianity and adiabaticity are possible , and the power spectrum might deviate from a power law @xcite . a spectrum with a nontrivial scale dependence might indicate a complicated inflaton potential exhibiting non - slow roll behavior .",
    "a correspondence exists between the scale dependence of the power spectrum , @xmath9 , and the field - dependence of the inflaton potential , @xmath10 : specifically , the n@xmath11-order term of the taylor expansion of @xmath10 in @xmath12 is linear in the n@xmath11-order term of the taylor expansion of @xmath9 in @xmath13 @xcite . by resolving the scale dependence of @xmath9 , in particular the higher - order runnings of the spectral index : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc . ,",
    "the paradigm of single field , slow roll inflation can be tested .    in order to observe these higher - order runnings",
    ", the spectrum must be measured across a wide range of length scales . the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and",
    "sloan s observations of baryon acoustic oscillations combine to probe scales @xmath16",
    "mpc@xmath17 mpc@xmath8 ; while these data exhibit a preference for @xmath5 , it is not statistically significant @xcite .",
    "the lyman alpha forest , which probes large scale structure on scales @xmath18 mpc@xmath8 @xcite , is promising , but converting flux measurements to a density power spectrum is difficult with our currently incomplete understanding of the properties of the intergalactic medium .",
    "recent ground - based observatories , like the south pole telescopeand the atacama cosmology telescope , have begun to place nearly decisive limits on the running of the spectral index by probing the damping tail of cmb fluctuations : @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite , and planck will do even better .",
    "current data , however , can go no further : in order to resolve higher - order runnings , we need a longer lever arm . by extending the observational window to smaller scales , @xmath9 can be recovered across a greater range of @xmath13 , and subtle higher - order terms in its taylor expansion will become relevant .",
    "one promising probe of small scale fluctuations is the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen , which will extend the observational window down to scales @xmath21 mpc@xmath8 @xcite , and resolve @xmath22 at the level of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we can expect these results in the coming years .",
    "but it might be possible to go even further : the thermal spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation traces fluctuations on scales 50 mpc@xmath23 mpc@xmath8 , offering an unprecedented glimpse into the character of the small - scale power spectrum .",
    "this is a fundamentally different kind of measurement : rather than probing the fluctuations themselves , the focus is on the _ dissipation _ of these fluctuations into the baryon - photon plasma and the resulting deviation of the thermal spectrum of the radiation field from that of a black body .",
    "the proposed pixie @xcite mission will be sensitive to these spectral distortions at a level useful for power spectrum reconstruction , and there has been recent interest in its prospects for improving constraints on @xmath22 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the potential of such a measurement for resolving the running of the running of the spectral index , @xmath24 .",
    "fluctuations in the baryon - photon plasma below the jeans scale oscillate as acoustic waves during radiation domination .",
    "the energy of these fluctuations is dissipated via diffusion damping , resulting in a redistribution of this energy from the fluctuations into the baryon - photon plasma @xcite . at early times ( @xmath25 ) , efficient double compton emission and bremsstrahlung , and the up - scattering of these photons by energetic electrons quickly thermalizes the baryon - photon plasma , preserving its black body spectrum .",
    "as the universe cools  between redshifts @xmath26  compton scattering ensures statistical equilibrium of the radiation field , but the production of photons is insufficient to maintain a black body : a frequency - dependent chemical potential , @xmath27 , develops and the spectrum shifts to that of a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "so , while small - scale perturbations are erased before recombination , they leave behind a record of their existence : the energy lost by the perturbations is injected into the cmb distorting the spectrum away from a black body by an amount that depends on the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum on the relevant scales .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath0-distortion amplitude obeys @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the double compton thermalization time , and @xmath30 is the fractional rate of energy dissipation , and double compton emission has been assumed the dominant source of photon production @xcite .",
    "this has the solution @xmath31}{\\rho_\\gamma } \\frac{d q}{dz}dz\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the energy density of the acoustic waves is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the squared sound speed , and the photon density perturbation , @xmath36 , has the ensemble average , @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 the transfer function , and @xmath40 is the primordial spectrum generated by inflation . since we are considering acoustic waves below the jeans scale during radiation domination , the transfer function is appropriate to modes that are well inside the horizon , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the sound horizon and the diffusion scale , @xmath43 , varies with redshift during radiation domination as @xmath44 where @xmath45 mpc@xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the free electron number density at @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the thompson scattering cross section .",

    "in contrast to the anisotropy measurements for which cmb data on scale @xmath54 constrains the spectrum at corresponding wavenumber , @xmath55 , the @xmath0-distortion measurement comes in the form of a weighted integral constraint on @xmath40 over the @xmath0-distortion epoch .",
    "the question of whether an observation detects a physical quantity , @xmath57 , is a problem in hypothesis testing : are the data sufficient to overturn the null hypothesis , in which @xmath58 ? in bayesian statistics , hypotheses are interpreted as models , and hypothesis testing proceeds via a comparison of the bayesian evidence of the first model , @xmath59 , with that of the second , @xmath60 , @xmath61 where * d * is the data and @xmath62 the model .",
    "the bayesian evidence is the average of the likelihood function , @xmath63 , weighted by the prior probability of the parameters , @xmath64 , @xmath65 once the evidence of each model is computed , the bayes factor eq .",

    "we are interested in the prospects of detecting and constraining higher - order runnings of the scalar power spectrum , specifically , the running of the running of the spectral index , @xmath74 , with future observations with the specifications of the pixie experiment @xcite , a proposed nulling polarimeter for the measurement of primordial gravitational waves . the model that we wish to study , @xmath71 , has a scalar power spectrum given by @xmath75 the base model , @xmath70 , has @xmath76 and so is contained in @xmath71 as a special case .",
    "this is a standard exercise in bayesian model comparison : is the data sufficient to warrant the addition of the parameter @xmath6 ?",
    "equivalently , the model comparison determines whether the likelihood of the model fit to the data is sufficiently improved , beyond statistical coincidence , when the new parameter is included . because the models @xmath70 and @xmath71 are nested , we make use of a representation of the bayes factor known as the _ savage - dickey density ratio _",
    "@xcite , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the marginalized posterior distribution of @xmath6 and @xmath79 its prior probability under model @xmath71 , and both are evaluated at @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ sdr ] ) .",
    "the savage - dickey density ratio is a convenient route to the bayes factor that does not require an evaluation of the bayesian evidence , which typically involves a high - dimensional integration that can be computationally demanding .",
    "it is nonetheless exact for nested models with separable priors .     for different fiducial amplitudes of @xmath0-distortion for model @xmath70 .",
    "the value of the best fit @xmath80 is shown for each case . ]",
    "current data is consistent with a null detection of @xmath6 , and so our objective is to determine how large the @xmath0-distortion must be in order to positively detect @xmath6 with pixie , _",
    "i.e. _ to substantiate its inclusion as a parameter in the model .",
    "we make use of two data sources : real cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropy data , and a notional @xmath0-distortion signal of the quality expected from pixie .",
    "the former data set includes the latest measurements from the wilkinson microwave anistropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "these data are well - described by the standard inflationary cosmology with base parameters : the baryon and cold dark matter densities , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath83 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath84 , and a power law spectrum of density perturbations parameterized by amplitude , @xmath85 , and spectral tilt , @xmath86 .",
    "the spt data requires three additional foreground parameters : the poisson point source power from randomly distributed galaxies , @xmath87 , the clustered point source power , @xmath88 , and the secondary emission from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect from clusters , @xmath89 .",
    "the model likelihood calculated from these parameters , which we denote @xmath90 to indicate that it refers to the wmap and spt @xmath91 anisotropy spectra , is described in @xcite .    the second data source , that arising from @xmath0-distortions , is notional . for a given fiducial amount of @xmath0-distortion , @xmath92 , the likelihood of the model with a theoretical value of @xmath0 given by eq .",

    "then , for a particular set of parameter values , the full likelihood of the model can be determined by simply summing the log - likelihoods of the two data sources , @xmath97 to summarize , we are considering an overall likelihood that derives from two separate data sources , cmb anisotropies and @xmath0-distortions , that probe different cosmological scales .",
    "since the real cmb anisotropy data are fixed , our task is to vary @xmath92 across the prior range until we achieve @xmath98 .",
    "this process sets up an interesting tension between the two data sources . on the one hand",
    ", we have cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy data that is well - fit by the model @xmath70 with @xmath76 . in fact , the simpler model with @xmath99 is still marginally preferred by current data @xcite , and is perfectly consistent with an amount of @xmath0-distortion below the pixie detection threshold of @xmath100 .",
    "however , as the fiducial amount of @xmath0-distortion is increased , even the model with running , @xmath70 , struggles to provide an acceptable fit .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 : as @xmath92 is increased , @xmath22 must get larger to accommodate the increase in small scale power needed to generate the fiducial amount of @xmath0-distortion .",
    "but @xmath70 can only provide increased small scale power at the cost of simultaneously increasing large scale power , and in an effort to fit ever larger values of @xmath92 , the model is pulled out of agreement with large scale cmb data . this effect signals the need for an additional parameter , @xmath101 , that gives a spectrum with increased small scale power  to accommodate the large @xmath0-distortion  without strongly modifying the shape of the large scale power spectrum that is well - constrained by current cmb data .    in order to calculate @xmath102 for a particular value of @xmath92 , the posterior , @xmath103 , and prior , @xmath104 , distributions must be determined .",
    "the prior encodes our current knowledge of @xmath6 , and is taken equivalent to the posterior distribution of @xmath6 obtained from wmap+spt data : it is close to gaussian with mean @xmath105 and standard deviation @xmath106 .",
    "the posterior distribution is obtained using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) over the parameter space of model @xmath71 : @xmath107 . for each sample , eq . ( [ int ] ) is numerically integrated with @xmath40 given by eq .",

    "( [ like ] ) .",
    "this process is iterative : if the @xmath102 thus calculated for the chosen fiducial value of @xmath92 does not satisfy @xmath109 , a new fiducial @xmath92 is selected and another mcmc run is begun .    in table 1",
    "we present the results of our analysis for different values of @xmath92 in the range @xmath110 $ ] . for each value of @xmath92 ,",

    "the corresponding resolution limit of the running of running is relatively large : @xmath116 .",
    "this is principally a result of the good constraints on @xmath5 on cmb scales : @xmath6 is forced to be big to yield a large enough @xmath0-distortion to be detected by an instrument like pixie .",
    "in addition to detecting @xmath113 , pixie will place relatively good constraints on its value : @xmath117 at 2@xmath1 , for @xmath118 .",
    "current constraints on the spectral parameters for wmap+spt are compared with projected constraints when pixie is included at this level in figure 2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that while @xmath0-distortion data greatly improves constaints on @xmath6 , there is little change in the posterior distributions of either @xmath86 or @xmath22 compared to current results .",
    "this is because both @xmath86 and @xmath22 are already well - constrained by wmap+spt : the existence of sufficient small scale power to generate a detectable level of @xmath0-distortion establishes the need for @xmath6 and constrains it without affecting the tight limits on @xmath86 and @xmath22 on cmb scales .",
    "the minimum amount of running of running that can be detected with statistical significance ( strong evidence , or 0.993 posterior odds ) is relatively large : @xmath4 , possibly in conflict with slow roll inflation , provided that the observed @xmath0-distortion is primordial .",
    "the slow roll approximation holds whenever the acceleration of the scalar field , @xmath119 , can be neglected relative to the cosmological drag , @xmath120 , with the result that @xmath121 where dots denote time derivatives and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "this is the case as long as the scalar field is potential - dominated : @xmath122 .",
    "slow roll can be maintained as long as the potential is sufficiently flat ; this condition is often stated in terms of the smallness of the parameters , @xmath123 where the dots denote terms involving higher derivatives of @xmath124 . but how many terms must we consider ?",
    "how small do they need to be ?",
    "the slow roll approximation can be formally derived by considering the taylor expansion of the hubble parameter @xcite , @xmath125 where @xmath126 and the subscript `` 0 '' indicates that the coefficients should be evaluated when the pivot scale , @xmath127 , exits the horizon , and we have chosen @xmath128 .",

    "it is therefore a prediction of slow roll inflation that higher - order spectral parameters should be vanishingly small , and that a general solution should be described by only the few lowest - order terms .",

    "not only are the first four parameters of equal magnitude , but the fifth parameter , @xmath160 , while only amounting to a small correction according to the slow roll approximation , strongly affects the inflationary dynamics and allows for @xmath163 to become large .",

    "the best - fit value associated with detection is @xmath169 , which is relatively large given any presumption of slow roll .",
    "this is a result of the tight constraints on @xmath22 on cmb scales : with @xmath5 , @xmath6 must be moderately large and positive in order for the spectrum to produce enough @xmath0-distortion on small scales to be detectable by pixie .",
    "constraints on @xmath6 are also improved by around a factor of 5 over current estimates .",
    "we next studied the implications that large @xmath6 has for single field slow roll inflation under the assumption that the primordial distortion is distinct from post - inflationary sources .",
    "we performed a flow analysis , focusing particularly on the next - to - leading order terms in the slow roll expansion and their role in the inflationary dynamics and observables .",
    "it was found that models taken to leading order ( @xmath144 ) failed to yield sufficient inflation or satisfy constraints on @xmath6 , while a truncation at next - to - leading order ( @xmath161 ) gave models with very different inflationary trajectories that succeeded in meeting these criteria . the inclusion of @xmath170 , while amounting to only a small correction according to the slow roll approximation , strongly alters the inflationary dynamics .",
    "successful @xmath161 models had slow roll parameters of roughly equal magnitude and importance , challenging the slow roll prescription that higher - order terms in the expansion should indicate ever smaller corrections to the inflationary observables and trajectories . we conclude that a detection of running of running by pixie will be in conflict with single field , slow roll inflation .",
    "the search for cmb @xmath0-distortions is a promising avenue for challenging the prevailing conception of inflation .",
    "it is important that work continues on understanding the possible foregrounds that might contaminate any @xmath0-distortion signal , as well as identifying possible post - inflationary sources of @xmath0-distortions that might mimic a primordial signal .",
    "if a measurement of primordial @xmath0-distortions by pixie results in a detection of @xmath6 , then this will be a strong indication that inflation either exhibits non - slow roll dynamics or is driven by multiple fields .",

    "<S> a future measurement of cosmic microwave @xmath0-distortions by an experiment with the specifications of pixie will provide an equivalent 3@xmath1 detection of the running of running of the spectral index of scalar perturbations , @xmath2 , if @xmath3 , covering much of the pixie sensitivity range . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a resolution limit of @xmath4 which is relatively large given any presumption of slow roll , a result of the current tight constraints on @xmath5 on cmb scales . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a detection of @xmath6 at this level is in conflict with slow roll conditions if the primordial signal can be distinguished from any post - inflationary contamination . </S>"
