    "the question of the origin of the stellar mass scale dates back to the time of eddington and jeans .",
    "modern observations reveal that the median stellar mass remains unchanged in star forming environments that vary by orders of magnitude in density , pressure , metal content , and other variables @xcite , which suggests that this mass must be set mostly by fundamental constants .",
    "a significant advance toward solving the problem has come from the realization that the characteristic fragmentation mass of interstellar clouds is determined primarily by their temperature structures @xcite .",
    "in retrospect this is not surprising , and can in fact be deduced simply from dimensional analysis .",
    "an isothermal , turbulent , self - graviting , magnetized gas is fully characterized by three dimensionless numbers ( e.g.  the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure @xmath0 , the mach number @xmath1 , and the virial ratio @xmath2 ) , but these ratios admit a rescaling that leaves the dimensionless numbers fixed but changes the mass scale arbitrarily .",
    "( for a formal proof see the appendix of @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "any simulation or analytic calculation of the evolution of an isothermal cloud can always be rescaled to produce objects of arbitrary mass , and the characteristic mass found in isothermal simulations depends mostly on the numerical resolution used @xcite . for this reason , analytic theories of the initial mass function ( imf ; e.g.  @xcite ) or simulations of star cluster formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that assume a purely isothermal equation of state may be able to predict the functional form of the stellar mass _ distribution _ as a function of quantities like @xmath1 , @xmath0 , or @xmath2 , but they are always forced to leave the absolute mass _ scale _ as a free parameter .",
    "thus any explanation of the characteristic stellar mass and its invariance must somehow depend on deviations from isothermality .",
    "given this realization , attention has therefore turned to the question of what processes determine the gas temperature structure , and what mass scale they select .",
    "one idea is that the characteristic stellar mass is set by a change from poor to strong dust - gas coupling at a density of @xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , this explanation faces the problem that the typical @xmath3 @xmath5 region of star cluster formation in the milky way is an order of magnitude denser than this ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , yet still manages to fragment down to masses @xmath6 . another proposed mechanism that applies to gas near galactic centers or in ulirgs is heating by either x - rays or cosmic rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these effects may indeed yield deviations from the canonical imf in extreme conditions , they do not apply to most star - forming environments . even near the galactic center",
    ", observations so far have yet to find any evidence for their influence on the imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "instead , the primary mechanism for determining the temperature structure of star - forming gas clouds appears to be radiation feedback produced by accretion onto the protostars themselves @xcite .",
    "this is the dominant energy source in a star - forming cloud @xcite , and at metallicities @xmath7 of the solar value @xcite and densities @xmath8 @xmath4 @xcite , which characterize almost all star - forming environments we are able to observe , this energy is well - coupled to the gas .",
    "simulations and analytic estimates show that it changes how gas fragments @xcite .",
    "the only attempt thus far to understand why radiative feedback leads to an invariant peak of the stellar imf is that of @xcite , who gives a scaling argument for why the density should have little effect on the imf peak . in this paper",
    "i expand and improve this argument in several ways .",
    "first , @xcite relies on an empirically - determined mass - radius relation to set the protostellar luminosity , and it is not clear how this might vary with star - forming environment or what physics sets it .",
    "i demonstrate that the necessary relation can be obtained , at least approximately , from fundamental constants .",
    "second , the argument in @xcite is limited to the case where the gas is optically thin .",
    "however , the optical depth of a protostellar core varies radically as a function of wavelength , and it is not clear at what wavelength the condition of optical thinness must be satisfied .",
    "consequently , it is not clear to which , if any , star - forming environments bate s argument can be applied .",
    "in contrast , the calculation i present here requires no assumptions about the optical depth of the star - forming region .",
    "third , @xcite only gives a scaling argument for why the characteristic stellar mass depends little on the ambient density , but does not actually estimate what this mass scale is .",
    "i provide such an estimate in terms of fundamental constants .",
    "the argument presented here therefore significantly expands the theory first advanced by @xcite and @xcite for how radiative feedback can set the stellar mass scale .",
    "consider a region of mean pressure @xmath9 that begins to collapse to form a star . because the dynamical time varies with volume density @xmath10 as @xmath11 , the densest portion of a cloud has the shortest dynamical time , and rapidly collapses to form a thermal pressure - supported seed protostar .",
    "the surrounding gas may then either accrete onto the existing protostar , or it may collapse independently to form additional stars . we can idealize the fragmentation of this gas as a competition of two processes . near the star , the gas will be heated by the star s radiation output , and this will raise its pressure and make it resistant to fragmentation .",
    "this material is therefore likely to accrete .",
    "far from the star , the gas is colder , and it is therefore likely to fragment into new stars rather than accreting onto the existing one .",
    "the goal then is to compute the typical mass @xmath12 of gas that is heated to the point where it will accrete rather than fragment  in effect to compute the protostar s thermal zone of influence .    in order to make this estimate , i approximate that this mass @xmath12 has a density distribution @xmath13 , where the radius @xmath14 is to be determined and @xmath15 m / r^3 $ ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath16 is arbitrary , and i show below that it makes almost no difference .",
    "obviously the overall assumption of spherical symmetry is not fully realistic , but this assumption enables us to perform an analytic calculation yet still capture the essential physics .",
    "the virial theorem implies that , for non - magnetized material in virial balance , the mass and radius are related via the external pressure by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the virial ratio . for a marginally bound object @xmath18 , and i adopt this value throughout .",
    "one might worry that the effective pressure might be enhanced by the ram pressure of inflow .",
    "however , observations of the flows around protostars indicates that , on the scales of individual low - mass protostellar cores , the inflow velocity is at most transonic , indicating that the infall ram pressure can not be much larger than the above estimate @xcite .",
    "this lack or strong shocks within cores is consistent with theoretical models of turbulent fragmentation @xcite .",
    "one might also worry that , if protostellar cores are sufficiently dominated by magnetic pressure , they may have @xmath19 . in the milky way",
    "this does not appear to be the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we can not directly rule out the possibility that cores are highly magnetic pressure - dominated in other galaxies .",
    "one should keep this caveat in mind .",
    "the minimum mass that is capable of undergoing gravitational instability and collapsing to form a second , separate protostar is the bonnor - ebert mass , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gas sound speed .",
    "numerical simulations including magnetic fields show that they do not significantly alter this characteristic fragment mass @xcite . thus if we consider successively larger spheres surrounding the first protostar , the smallest such sphere that contains enough mass to be capable of fragmenting and forming another star has a mass @xmath22 . the material interior to that will therefore have to accrete onto the first star ( or be ejected by its outflow ) .",
    "we may therefore think of the time - evolution of the system as follows .",
    "the instant after a protostar forms , its mass @xmath23 is very small .",
    "in contrast , the bonnor - ebert mass in the gas around it is @xmath24 and this is much larger than @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , although the protostar is small , it has a much larger reservoir of gas around it that is too warm to fragment , and will instead accrete .",
    "as the star gains mass , both @xmath23 and @xmath25 rise , but @xmath25 rises much more slowly ",
    "the star is consuming mass faster than its reservoir is growing .",
    "once the mass accreted onto the star is equal to the entire mass of the heated reservoir , fragmentation becomes likely and the star will stop growing .",
    "this condition provides our estimate for the characteristic stellar mass : @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xcite is the fraction of the mass that has collapsed ( _ not _ the fraction of the entire available mass reservoir ) that has been incorporated into the star rather than being ejected by the protostellar outflow , @xmath28 is the gas temperature at the edge of the region that will form the star , @xmath29 is the hydrogen mass , and @xmath30 is the mean particle mass ( in units of @xmath29 ) for a molecular hydrogen - dominated gas of solar composition .",
    "figure [ fig : mvsm ] illustrates this procedure graphically : at small @xmath23 , the available reservoir mass @xmath31 , but as @xmath23 rises , eventually the two become equal and fragmentation sets in .",
    "the temperature @xmath28 is set by the radiation of the central star .",
    "if this star has luminosity @xmath32 , this is well - approximated by @xcite @xmath33^{4{k_{\\rm t}}-2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } \\times \\left(\\frac{m}{\\pi r^2}\\right)^{(4+\\beta){k_{\\rm t}}+{k_{\\rho}}-3 } , \\label{eq : trho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 . here",
    "the dust opacity is taken to follow a wavelength - dependence @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a dimensionless number and we arbitrarily define @xmath37 @xmath38 g@xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath41 m , and @xmath42 k. with this parameterization @xmath43 and @xmath44 for milky way dust @xcite .",
    "dust coagulation can alter @xmath36 by factors of a few and @xmath45 by a few tenths @xcite , but i show below that the results are extremely insensitive to these variations of this magnitude . the index @xmath46 and the dimensionless constant @xmath47 in turn are given by @xmath48^{4/\\beta}\\right\\}^{-\\beta/\\gamma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this calculation assumes that the only significant source of luminosity is the single accreting protostar at the center , which is true only if the thermal zones of influence of different stars do not overlap .",
    "numerical simulations and analytic calculations by @xcite show that this is a good approximation as long as the star formation rate in a protocluster where stars are forming is @xmath49 of the mass per free - fall time .",
    "all observed star - forming regions , both within and outside the galaxy , obey this constraint @xcite .",
    "the calculation also assumes that the heated region is spherically symmetric .",
    "numerical simulations show that that this is not a bad approximation , since the highly diffusive nature of the radiation - matter interaction tends to produce fairly round heated regions even in the presence of asymmetric features such as accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity of young low mass stars is dominated by accretion , so @xmath32 will be proportional to the accretion rate .",
    "this is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the dynamical time in the collapsing region . for this accretion rate ,",
    "the corresponding luminosity is @xmath52 where @xmath23 and @xmath53 are the stellar mass and radius , @xmath54 is the energy yield per unit mass for accreted matter , and @xmath55 is the fraction of the accretion power that goes into light rather than into driving an outflow @xcite . can also be reduced by episodic accretion that delivers some fraction of the final mass in short - duration bursts ; however , comparisons with the observed protostellar luminosity function suggest that the reduction in luminosity during the non - burst phase is modest , only @xmath56 @xcite , and i show below that the characteristic mass depends fairly weakly on @xmath57 .",
    "thus i do not attempt to include this effect . ]",
    "equations ( [ eq : pressure ] ) , ( [ eq : mch1 ] ) , ( [ eq : trho ] ) , and ( [ eq : lum ] ) , together with @xmath58 , fully determine @xmath23 .",
    "computing @xmath58 is therefore the next task .",
    "the energy yield from accretion @xmath58 is dictated by a number of factors , but the single most important one is deuterium burning . for almost all stars this sets during accretion , and it forces the stellar core to a nearly fixed central temperature .",
    "i approximate d - burning stars as @xmath59 polytropes , although different values of @xmath60 produce qualitatively identical results . assuming the stellar core is fully ionized and dominated by ideal gas pressure",
    ", this implies that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the central temperature , @xmath63 is the mean mass per particle for a fully ionized gas of solar composition , and @xmath64 is a dimensionless number that depends on the polytropic index ; for @xmath59 , @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "i estimate the equilibrium central temperature @xmath62 following the formalism of @xcite , in which a star of mass @xmath23 and radius @xmath53 is approximated as a polytrope of index @xmath60 , for which the density distribution follows @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the central density , @xmath68 is the dimensionless radius , and @xmath69 is the solution to the lane - emden equation @xmath70 with the boundary conditions @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "assuming the star is dominated by ideal gas pressure , the temperature is then @xmath73 . from this solution ,",
    "the dimensionless decay rate for the temperature as a function of radius is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is defined by the condition @xmath76 ; the dimensionless mass is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is defined by the condition @xmath79 .",
    "the next step in the calculation is to estimate the rate of nuclear energy generation per unit volume using the laplace approximation @xcite , which gives @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant that depends on the properties and abundance of the reactants , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the gamow energy for the reaction .",
    "here @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the charges on the two reacting nuclei , @xmath86 is their reduced mass , and @xmath87 is the fine structure constant .",
    "comparison with detailed calculations of nuclear reaction rates @xcite shows that this is an excellent approximation for the d burning reaction with which we are concerned ( discussed in more detail below ) as long as the temperature is @xmath88 k. note that , if we define @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the rate of nuclear energy integrated over the stellar volume is @xmath91 , where @xmath92    given these approximations , @xcite shows ( his equation 25 ) that the conditions of thermal and hydrostatic balance within the star require that the central temperature roughly obey @xmath93 assuming the star is fully ionized so the mean particle mass is @xmath94 .",
    "here @xmath95 is the opacity at the center of the star , and which we approximate as dominated by thompson scattering , so @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the thompson cross section @xmath98 is the hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "the results are quite insensitive to changes in @xmath95 by factors of a few , or even tens .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : thetac ] ) is derived assuming that energy transport is by radiation rather than convection , which is true only in part of the star during d burning .",
    "however , below i compare the value of @xmath58 derived from this assumption to the results of a detailed numerical model that includes convection , and show that convection alters @xmath58 by at most a factor of a few .    in order to solve equation ( [ eq : thetac ] ) for the central temperature @xmath99 ,",
    "the final necessary step is to compute the reaction constant @xmath81 , defined by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the velocity times cross section for the reaction , @xmath102 is the net energy released per reaction , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the mean mass ( in units of @xmath29 ) per reactant of species @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and the angle brackets indicate averages over the maxwellian velocity distribution of reacting particles . note that , since @xmath107 depends on the temperature as @xmath108 in the laplace approximation , this quantity is temperature - independent .    at the @xmath109 k temperatures typical of deuterium - burning stars , the dominant d burning reaction chain by a large margin is @xcite @xmath110 which yields @xmath111 mev per d burned , with negligible neutrino losses",

    "numerically solving equation ( [ eq : thetac ] ) using this value of @xmath81 gives the results shown in figure [ fig : thetac ] .",
    "we see that @xmath99 is almost completely insensitive to changes in the polytropic index , and varies by only tens of percent as @xmath23 or @xmath115 $ ] vary by orders of magnitude .",
    "the central temperature is @xmath121 .",
    "thus we have @xmath122 for @xmath123 , i find @xmath124 k , and @xmath125 erg g@xmath39 , which agrees to within a factor of @xmath126 with the results of detailed stellar structure models @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : psiplot ] shows a more detailed comparison . as the plot shows , the polytropic estimate agrees with the numerical result to better than half a dex at all masses @xmath127 @xmath5 , and to better than a dex at all masses @xmath128 @xmath5 .",
    "i show below that errors of this magnitude have very little effect on the final result .",
    "equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) completes the system formed by equations ( [ eq : pressure ] ) , ( [ eq : mch1 ] ) , ( [ eq : trho ] ) , and ( [ eq : lum ] ) , and uniquely specifies @xmath12 and @xmath23 . before proceeding with a numerical solution , however , one can gain considerable insight from an approximate analytic solution . notice that equations ( [ eq : kt ] )  ( [ eq : rt ] ) imply that @xmath129 and @xmath130 as long as @xmath131 . the quantity",
    "@xmath132 represents the ratio of the radius of the dust photosphere to the core radius , and this will be @xmath133 as long as the core is opaque enough that stellar photons escape primarily by diffusing to frequencies where the core optical depth is @xmath134 rather than by diffusing out of the core in space while remaining at frequencies where the core is optically thick .",
    "this is the case for almost all of the parameter space relevant to star formation , as can be verified readily from a numerical solution i give below . for the purposes of analytic approximation , therefore , it is reasonable to adopt @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , @xmath99 is nearly independent of the stellar mass .",
    "if one takes these approximate values as exact , assumes @xmath99 is mass - independent , and further takes @xmath135 ( as expected for most dust models ) and @xmath136 , then it is possible to solve the system of equations analytically .",
    "after some manipulation , the result is @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the gravitational fine structure constant defined for two protons , @xmath139 dyn @xmath140 is the planck pressure , and in the numerical evaluation in equation ( [ eq : mchapprox ] ) i have used @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath65 , and @xmath143 . note that the dust abundance @xmath36 drops out of the problem entirely ; numerical simulations show that this is an excellent approximation @xcite .",
    "pressures in star - forming systems cover a @xmath144 decade range , from the relatively diffuse molecular clouds found in nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite ( surface density @xmath145 g @xmath140 , corresponding to a pressure @xmath146 k @xmath4 ) to the densest star - forming gas clumps seen in the galaxy ( @xmath147 g @xmath140 , corresponding to @xmath148 k @xmath4 ) . in extragalactic stellar systems such as the cores of giant ellipticals @xcite and super star clusters @xcite we see surface densities that reach even higher values of @xmath149 g @xmath140 .",
    "we do not know if these systems formed from gas at similarly high surface densities , but if they did the corresponding pressures would be @xmath150 k @xmath4 . equation ( [ eq : mstar ] ) predicts that even over this very large pressure range , the characteristic stellar mass should vary by only @xmath151 of a dex",
    ". for comparison , figure [ mstar1 ] shows an exact numerical solution for @xmath23 as a function of pressure .",
    "we see that , while the pressure - dependence is slightly steeper than that predicted in the analytic approximation ( mainly because @xmath46 is not exactly @xmath152 ) , the characteristic mass still varies by only a decade or so as the pressure varies by more than six decades .",
    "figure [ mstar2 ] shows numerical solutions for varying stellar polytropic indices , density powerlaw indices , metallicities , dust spectral indices , and radiative energy budgets ( i.e.  values of @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) variation is @xmath58 or @xmath57 is chosen to encompass the error in the value of @xmath58 that results from the polytropic approximation . this error shown in figure [ fig : psiplot]b . ] .",
    "strikingly , most of these factors make no significant difference . varying @xmath60 , @xmath153 , @xmath45 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 within the plausible ranges of variation indicated by the upper and lower curves in the figure produces less than a factor of 1.6 change in the characteristic stellar mass at all pressures @xmath154 k @xmath4 .",
    "the only factor that matters marginally more is metallicity ; decreasing @xmath36 to @xmath155 , i.e.  using a metallicity that is roughly @xmath156 the solar value , induces a factor of 2 change in the characteristic mass , while using @xmath157 produces a factor of @xmath158 shift .",
    "this confirms the analytic expectation that the properties of the interstellar environment  metallicity , dust properties , and degree of gas concentration  change the characteristic mass very weakly or not at all .",
    "the central results of this paper are equation ( [ eq : mstar ] ) and figure [ mstar1 ] , which describe the characteristic stellar mass in terms of the hydrogen mass multiplied by a series of dimensionless factors .",
    "some of these describe the geometry of the stellar accretion flow ( @xmath57 , @xmath159 ) , the internal structure of protostars ( @xmath64 ) , and the chemical composition of gas ( @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) , and are always @xmath134 .",
    "others depend on the relative strength of electromagnetic , gravitational , and nuclear forces ( @xmath87 , @xmath162 ) ; these are fundamental constants .",
    "the result also depends on @xmath99 , which describes the energy scale in a stellar core in units of the gamow energy .",
    "this is set mostly by the properties of the deuterium plus hydrogen fusion reaction , which also ultimately depends on fundamental constants .",
    "finally , the last term depends on the interstellar pressure measured in units of the planck pressure ; this is the only term that makes any reference to interstellar conditions , and there with an extraordinarily weak dependence .",
    "we can therefore understand why the characteristic stellar mass should be invariant over such a broad range of conditions : it is set almost entirely by fundamental constants , with an almost vanishing dependence on interstellar conditions .",
    "furthermore , this result naturally explains why the stellar mass scale is such that nuclear reactions can be ignited in stars .",
    "until deuterium burning begins in stellar cores , stars contract rapidly as they gain mass , their cores heat up , and @xmath58 becomes a strongly increasing function of mass . during this phase , as stars gain mass their thermal zone of influence rapidly expands , since increasing mass also increases the energy yield from accretion . only once nuclear burning begins and the stellar core temperature is stabilized does the energy yield from accretion become roughly constant , and the zone of influence ceases to expand as rapidly , favoring fragmentation .",
    "thus the onset of fragmentation is directly linked to stars reaching a mass such that nuclear reactions can begin .",
    "finally , i do find a very weak residual dependence of the characteristic stellar mass on the interstellar pressure and metallicity .",
    "these effects are small enough that they are likely to be masked within a single galaxy , or even over a wide range of galaxies of relatively similar properties , by random variations in factors like the accretion geometry , dust properties , and interstellar pressures",
    ". however , the dependence on pressure and metallicity may produce noticeable variations in samples that include galaxies where stars formed under conditions radically different than those found today .",
    "in particular , i find that the characteristic mass decreases weakly but noticeably in very high pressure and high metallicity environments such as the cores of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "there is preliminary evidence for such a bottom - heavy imf based on the presence of unexpectedly strong absorption features characteristic of very low mass stars in spectra taken from the central portions of giant ellipticals @xcite . at this point",
    "any link between this observational result and the theoretical one i derive here is necessarily speculative .",
    "we have no direct knowledge of the properties of the gas from which these stars formed , and it is possible that the pressure was less than one would infer from density of the final stellar system .",
    "even if the pressures are high , we possess of a limited understanding of the physics of star formation in such extreme environments .",
    "nonetheless , this work points to the need for further investigation of star formation at very high pressures , both observationally and theoretically .",
