    "the dashed lines show the primordial @xmath0-mode power spectra with the tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath32 and 0.001 , while the dotted line shows the secondary @xmath0-mode power spectrum from gravitational lensing .",

    ", width=321 ]    figure  [ fig : like ] shows the likelihood of @xmath1 for the input value of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , 5 , 10 , and 100 .",
    "one useful number to keep in mind is that a _ single _",
    "multipole , @xmath31 , is sufficient for detecting @xmath30 , if the noise is smaller than @xmath48k  arcmin .",
    "however , the precision on @xmath1 does not improve beyond @xmath52 .",
    "this is apparent also in figure  [ fig : clnoise ] : the noise power spectrum exceeds the signal at @xmath53 .",
    "we can improve the precision further if we lower the noise level to , say , @xmath47k  arcmin .",
    "even so , the gravitational lensing prevents us from improving on the precision beyond @xmath49 if @xmath30 .",
    "( if there were no lensing in the universe , we would be able to continue to improve on the precision , as indicated by the dashed lines . ) in fact , @xmath47k  arcmin is essentially the same as zero detector noise , as the lensing term dominates the error budget .",

    ", these results are overly optimistic , as the error would be dominated by the foreground rather than by the detector noise .",
    "nevertheless , it is still useful to know what would be possible when we ignore the foreground .    to quantify the precision on @xmath1 ,",
    "it is convenient to use the variance , @xmath54 , given by the second moment of the likelihood : @xmath55 ^ 2.\\ ] ] here , we have assumed that the likelihood is normalized such that @xmath56 .",
    "one should be careful when interpreting this quantity . for @xmath51",
    ", @xmath57 would be greater than the input value , @xmath58 ; however , this does not mean that we can not detect @xmath1 .",
    "this just means that the distribution is highly non - gaussian and has a long tail toward large values of @xmath1 ( see the top left panel of figure  [ fig : like ] ) . for large values of @xmath42 , e.g. , @xmath59 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 becomes approximately a gaussian , and thus the value of @xmath57 may be interpreted as the size of the usual @xmath60 error bar .",

    "note that @xmath65 at @xmath66 does not mean that we do not detect @xmath1 ; on the contrary , we detect @xmath1 with high significance even at @xmath46 .",
    "rather , it just means that the likelihood for @xmath1 is highly non - gaussian and has a long tail toward large values of @xmath1 ( see the top left panel of figure  [ fig : like ] ) . in other words ,",
    "we detect @xmath1 with high statistical significance , but the value of @xmath1 is not determined very well . ,",
    "width=321 ]    figure  [ fig : significance ] shows the fractional error , @xmath67 , on the determination of the value of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "first , as one may expect from figure  [ fig : like ] , the fractional error for @xmath58 saturates at @xmath69 and does not improve further due to the lensing noise .",
    "for this case , while we can detect @xmath1 with high statistical significance , we can determine the actual value of @xmath1 to only @xmath70% .",
    "for @xmath71 , we can determine the value of @xmath1 to @xmath72% at @xmath73 ( beyond which the fractional error no longer improves due to the lensing noise ) .",
    "this study gives us an estimate of statistical errors on the measured values of @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the galactic foreground gives us systematic errors ( and bias ) .",
    "now we shall turn to the foreground issue , which is the main subject of this paper .",
    "the basic idea behind our methodology is simple : we have ( at least ) 3 polarized components on the sky that we know and have been detected by the _ wmap _",
    ": cmb , synchrotron emission , and thermal dust emission . as the synchrotron dominates at lower frequencies and the dust at higher frequencies , we use one map at a low frequency and another map at a high frequency as the foreground `` templates . ''",
    "we put the quotation marks here because these maps also contain the cmb .",
    "no _ external _ template maps are used in our method .",
    "the _ wmap _ team has applied this method for modeling the synchrotron : they used the lowest frequency ( k - band , 23  ghz ) map as a template , fitted it to the higher frequency maps ( ka , q , v , and w bands ) , and subtracted from those maps .",
    "one can write this operation as @xmath74(\\nu)=\\frac{[q , u](\\nu)-\\alpha_s(\\nu)[q , u](\\nu=23~{\\rm ghz})}{1-\\alpha_s(\\nu)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the template - cleaned stokes @xmath22 and @xmath23 maps , respectively , and @xmath77 is the best - fit synchrotron coefficient for a given frequency @xmath78 .",
    "the denominator accounts for the fact that the k - band map also contains the cmb signal .",
    "however , the _ wmap _ team had to rely on an external map for modeling the dust emission , as the highest frequency , the w band ( 94  ghz ) , was not high enough for being a good template of the polarized dust emission . this issue would probably be resolved by the _ planck _ satellite , which has higher frequency channels such as 217 and 353  ghz .",
    "@xcite have studied this by using a simulated _ planck _ 217  ghz or 353  ghz map as a template for dust , and a simulated 30  ghz map as a template for synchrotron .",
    "they find that this simple method removes the foreground efficiently , bringing the bias in @xmath1 down to a few times @xmath79 , which is much smaller than the expected statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 from _ planck _ , @xmath80 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to put this method in the context of a next - generation , low noise ( 2  @xmath27k  arcmin ) polarization satellite experiment , and see if this method yields a promising result for measuring @xmath81 ( which is easy to detect in the absence of foreground , as we just saw in section  [ sec : noise ] ) .",
    "our methodology is similar to that given in section  4.2 of @xcite .",
    "the main parameter that we wish to extract from data is the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath1 .",
    "( we do not vary the tensor tilt , @xmath82 . )",
    "the foreground coefficients , @xmath83 , are nuisance parameters that we wish to marginalize over . the foreground coefficients may be spatially varying .",
    "another nuisance parameter ( for detecting @xmath0 modes ) is the amplitude of the scalar @xmath11-mode power spectrum , which is by far the dominant source of cmb polarization .",
    "the signal power spectra are thus given as @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the power spectra with @xmath86 and @xmath38 .",
    "the fiducial value of @xmath87 is @xmath86 .",
    "we shall maximize the following likelihood function for estimating @xmath1 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 : @xmath89}{\\sqrt{\\vert { \\bm    c(r , s , \\alpha_i)}\\vert } } , \\label{eq : fulllike}\\ ] ] where @xmath90(\\nu)-\\sum_i\\alpha_i(\\nu)[q , u](\\nu^{\\rm   template}_i)}{1-\\sum_i\\alpha_i(\\nu)}\\ ] ] is a template - cleaned map .",
    "this is a generalization of equation  ( [ eq : quclean ] ) for a multi - component case . in this paper , @xmath91 takes on `` s '' and `` d '' for synchrotron and dust , respectively , unless noted otherwise . for definiteness , we shall choose : @xmath92 these choices are somewhat arbitrary , but our preliminary optimization study indicates that this is a good configuration for achieving a smaller bias in @xmath1 . a fuller optimization study , including more frequency channels , would require a more detailed specification of a given experiment ( e.g. , how many detectors one can fit in a given focal place ; how low the detector noise can be as a function of frequencies ) , which is beyond the scope of this paper , but will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the covariance matrix in pixel space , @xmath93 , for stokes @xmath22 and @xmath23 maps is given as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the signal covariance matrix calculated from the theoretical power spectra , @xmath85 , ( see appendix  [ sec : cov ] ) and the noise matrices , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , are a noise covariance of a smoothed map ( which is not diagonal ) _ before the template cleaning is applied _ , and a small artificial diagonal noise matrix for a matrix regularization , respectively ( see section  [ sec : cmbnoise ] for details ) .    for simplicity and clarity , we have ignored noise in template maps . for , if we assume that all three channels are similar in detector noise level , it is a good approximation , as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and the fractional contribution of the template noise to the covariance matrix is given by @xmath100 , i.e. , 6% effect in the derived error bars .",
    "note that this is equivalent to ignoring * p * in section  4.2 of @xcite .",
    "for cmb , we first generate the scalar and tensor polarization power spectra using the camb code @xcite with and without lensing contributions .",
    "we then generate stokes @xmath22 and @xmath23 maps at the healpix resolution of @xmath101 .",
    "the signal map has been smoothed with a @xmath102 beam ( fwhm ) , representing a low - angular - resolution cmb polarization satellite experiment targeting the primordial @xmath0 modes .    to this smoothed signal map , we add random gaussian noise given by @xmath103 per pixel in the direction of @xmath104 . here",
    ", @xmath105 is related to noise @xmath106 as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the total number of pixels at @xmath101 , and @xmath109 is the number of observations per pixel .",
    "we adopt @xmath109 from the `` epic low - cost '' ( epic - lc ) design @xcite .",
    "the noise is highest on the ecliptic plane and lowest on the ecliptic poles , similar to the @xmath109 pattern of the _",
    "wmap_. note that the absolute value of @xmath109 will cancel out in @xmath110 if we use the above formula : only the spatial distribution is taken from @xmath109 , and the overall noise level is set by the assumed value of @xmath106 .",
    "we shall use @xmath111k  arcmin for the rest of this paper .",
    "for this low noise configuration , the results are not sensitive to the details of the @xmath109 pattern .",
    "as we described at the end of section  [ sec : method ] , noise in template maps ( at @xmath112  ghz and @xmath113  ghz ) makes only a small contribution to the final covariance matrix .",
    "therefore , for simplicity we add noise only to our cmb channel at 100  ghz .",
    "we then apply an additional gaussian smoothing to this signal - plus - noise map with 9.16 degrees ( fwhm ) , which is @xmath114 times the pixel size at @xmath115 , and re - sample the smoothed map to @xmath115 . finally , as the smoothed map at @xmath115",
