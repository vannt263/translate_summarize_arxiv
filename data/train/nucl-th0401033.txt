    "processes of meson electroproduction have played an important role in studying the structure and properties of matter ( see , _ e.g. _ review  @xcite ) . in the past few years , however , reactions with production of dileptons in hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions have drawn much attention @xcite . in these reactions",
    "virtual photons , which materialize as dileptons ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath2 pair ) , carry unique information on properties of matter because the processes in which the particle structure is formed proceed in the timelike region of the `` mass '' ( @xmath3 ) of the virtual photon . therefore , further investigation of these reactions is necessary and promising in acquisition of new and perhaps unexpected information about the form factors of hadrons and nuclei .    the inverse pion electroproduction ( ipe ) , @xmath1 , ( or dileptonproduction ) , being for a long time the only source of information on the nucleon electromagnetic structure in the timelike region , has been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite since the beginning of the 1960s . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we worked out the method of extracting the pion and nucleon electromagnetic form factors from ipe at low energies .",
    "this method has been successfully applied in the analysis of experimental data on the nucleon and @xmath4c and @xmath5li nuclei  @xcite and values of the form factors were obtained for the first time in the timelike region of @xmath3 ranging from 0.05 to 0.22 ( gev / c)@xmath6 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed to use ipe at intermediate ( above @xmath7 resonances ) energies and small @xmath8 to study the nucleon electromagnetic structure and justified it up to @xmath9 .",
    "though experimental data @xcite on the @xmath10 process are now available , there still remains a wide range of @xmath3 ( up to @xmath11 ) , where the form factors can not be measured directly in these experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the intense pion beams available now enable one to perform more detailed experiments on ipe aimed at both extracting the hadron structure and carrying out a multipole analysis similar to those for photoproduction and electroproduction ( see,_e.g .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "such experiments can address interesting topics .",
    "for example , in the @xmath12 region it is challenging to verify the @xmath3 dependence of the color - magnetic - force contribution found in the constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , worth recalling the earlier discovered properties of the photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe to consistently substantiate methods of studying the electromagnetic and weak structure of the nucleon on the basis of the ipe data in the first resonance region , and to provide new results of this analysis .",
    "additional motive for studying ipe in the first resonance region is the possibility of investigating the nucleon weak structure by utilizing the same data as for the electromagnetic structure .",
    "this possibility is based on the current algebra ( ca ) description and on the remarkable property of ipe . in the ipe process",
    "the creation of the @xmath2 pairs of maximal mass ( at the `` quasithreshold '' ) is dominated by the born mechanism , whereas the rescattering - effect contributions are at the level of radiative corrections up to the total @xmath7 energy @xmath13 gev ( the `` quasithreshold theorem '' ) @xcite . due to this property ,",
    "the threshold ca theorems for the pion electroproduction and photoproduction can be justified in the case of ipe up to the indicated energy @xcite .",
    "this allows one to avoid threshold difficulties when using the ipe data ( unlike the electroproduction one ) for extracting the weak form factors of the nucleon .",
    "furthermore , in the case of ipe there is no strong kinematic restriction inherent to the @xmath14 capture and no kinematic suppression of contributions of the induced pseudoscalar nucleon form factor to the cross sections of `` straight '' processes , such as @xmath15 , present because of multiplying by the lepton masses .",
    "information on the pseudoscalar nucleon form factor @xmath16 , which is practically absent for the above reasons , is important because @xmath16 contains contributions of states with the pion quantum numbers and , therefore , it is related to the chiral symmetry breaking . this would enable us , _",
    "e.g. _ , to test the goldberger  treiman relation .",
    "another aim of this paper is to draw attention of experimenters to the process @xmath1 as a natural and unique laboratory for investigating the hadron structure .",
    "one could use these processes for determining the baryon resonance dynamics based on the study of the @xmath17 interference pattern @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , investigation of the exclusive reactions @xmath18 in experiments with high - energy pions at large invariant mass of the dilepton and small squared momentum transfer to the nucleon could provide access to generalized parton distributions as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give the basic formalism for the unified treatment of the reactions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . in sec .",
    "iii we present our dispersion - relation model for unified description of these three reactions and compare the calculated results with experimental data .",
    "to clearly explain our method , we choose a simple version of the model , which satisfactorily describes the data on the photoproduction and electroproduction . in sec .",
    "iv , we outline the method of determining the nucleon electromagnetic form factors from low - energy ipe and discuss some results of its application to analysis of the ipe data on the nucleon .",
    "section  v is devoted to extracting the pseudoscalar nucleon form factor from the same ipe data , and interpretation of the results is given .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "appendices present the relations between the amplitudes , derivation of the quasithreshold constraints for the multipole amplitudes on the basis of the principle of the first - class maximum analyticity , and explanation of the compensation effect .",
    "we consider the reactions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 in the framework of the unified model .",
    "this approach is natural because in the one - photon approximation , due to the @xmath22-invariance , research into these three processes is related to a study of the process  @xmath23 with the hadron current  @xmath24 , where  @xmath25 ,  @xmath26 ,  and  @xmath27   correspond to the pion photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe , respectively .",
    "this allows us to predict peculiarities of the ipe dynamics on the basis of a rich experimental material on the electroproduction and photoproduction and to test the reliability of the unified model for these three processes .",
    "the @xmath28-matrix element for the electroproduction in the one - photon approximation is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the matrix element of the lepton electromagnetic current , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 are the four - momenta of the initial ( final ) electron , nucleon , and final pion , respectively .",
    "momentum of the virtual photon is @xmath36 ( @xmath37 for ipe ) , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are mandelstam variables .",

    "to obtain reliable information on the nucleon structure , it is important to find kinematic conditions under which the ipe dynamics is determined mainly by a model - independent part of interactions , the born one .",
    "to this end , we utilize such general principles , as analyticity , unitarity , and lorentz invariance and the phenomenology of the processes @xmath100 and @xmath101 , considered in the framework of the unified ( including ipe ) model .",
    "we use a simple version of the model , which describes the experimental data satisfactorily with a minimal number of parameters ( electromagnetic form factors ) .",

    "moreover , this model is adequate for our purpose , namely to formulate the method for determination of the form factors in the timelike region , for the following reasons .",
    "first , in the dispersion - relation approach , the spectral functions in the first resonance region are expressed through the nucleon electromagnetic form factors and the phase shift of the @xmath7-scattering @xmath105 .",
    "this reduces considerably the number of fitted parameters , which is especially important in the ipe analysis .",
    "second , in the @xmath103 region , the electric @xmath106 and scalar @xmath107 quadrupoles , which ( as the magnetic dipole @xmath108 ) describe excitation of the resonance @xmath103 , amount to not more than 15% of @xmath108 .",
    "for example , the photoproduction data @xcite give the value @xmath109 for the @xmath110 ratio .",
    "phenomenological results for the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath110 and @xmath111 ratios are not stable yet and depend upon the method of their extraction from electroproduction data ( see discussion of this point in ref .",

    "based on the quark model calculations ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we suppose that an analogous situation takes place also for @xmath113 , at least up to @xmath114  0.3 ( gev / c)@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , at the first stage of our analysis we neglect the quadrupole excitations of @xmath103 , which we expect to be a good approximation for processes with unpolarised nucleons .",
    "the conventional procedure of reggeization provides us with behaviour of the invariant amplitudes for @xmath115 and small @xmath8 @xcite @xmath116 consequently , in a complete @xmath46-channel description , we should write a fixed-@xmath102 dispersion relation with one subtraction at finite energy for the isovector amplitude @xmath117 and without subtractions for the remaining amplitudes , taking into account their crossing properties . however , the dispersion integrals with the spectral functions which describe the magnetic excitation of the @xmath103 resonance converge very well already at @xmath118 2  gev for all the amplitudes @xmath66 .",

    "it is obvious that our model can be further improved by including the quadrupole excitation of the @xmath103 resonance ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) in the spectral functions .",
    "however , a still more elaborate model should include , in addition to the quadrupole excitation , contributions of other nucleon isobars and high - energy `` tails '' to the absorption parts of the amplitudes to ensure a balanced consideration of small corrections .",
    "furthermore , analytic continuation of the corrected absorption parts of the amplitudes into the unobservable region in the dispersion integrals , @xmath148 for @xmath149 , requires use of the quasithreshold relations ( following from causality analyticity ) between the electric and longitudinal multipoles @xcite in which `` toroid '' multipoles appear @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the analytic continuation with the approximation ( [ eq : ima ] ) is immediate .",
    "however , having in mind the quality of contemporary experimental data , the above - stated simple model seems to be quite sufficient ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : ph - pr - n]-[fig : e - pr - n2 ] ) .",
    "application of the model to the calculations for ipe shows an interesting growth of the relative contribution of the born terms with @xmath3 and their dominance in the neighbourhood of the value @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "this approximate dominance of the born terms has a model - independent explanation .",
    "it is related to the quasithreshold theorem @xcite , which means that at the quasithreshold , @xmath151 , the ipe amplitude becomes the born one in the energy region from the threshold up to @xmath13  gev .",
    "this remarkable dynamics of ipe distinguishes it essentially from the photoproduction and electroproduction , where rescattering effects amount @xmath152 .",
    "let us explain the quasithreshold behaviour of the ipe amplitude .",
    "as @xmath153 the multipole amplitudes behave in the following way @xmath154 therefore , at @xmath155 only the electric ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) dipoles survive . in addition , the number of independent dipole transitions diminishes to the two ones at the quasithreshold due to the quasithreshold constraints @xmath160 which arise from the causality ( analyticity ) .",

    "[ fig : comp - curv ] the compensation curves for the charged pion photoproduction are shown . calculating the born cross sections , we take into account the interaction of the photon only with the charge",
    ". therefore , along these curves the experimental cross sections are completely described by the electric born terms .",
    "one can see that at high energies , the compensation curves pass through small angles in accordance with the electric born model ( ebm ) @xcite .",
    "the compensation curves show also that an applicability of ebm to the cross section extends to the whole energy range , but at the corresponding angles , giving a more complete and transparent picture .",
    "of course , there are also compensation curves corresponding to the total born amplitude .",
    "now , if one assumes that for processes of the pion electroproduction and ipe , when @xmath166 , the compensation curves are not much different from the corresponding curves for the photoproduction @xmath345 , then along these curves the model dependence of description of the processes should be minimal . in the resonance region , this assumption would be reasonable if the change of @xmath3 does not lead to the essential reconstruction of the helicity ( or multipole ) structure of the excitation of the corresponding resonance . in the first resonance region , calculations , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the dispersion theory , which agree with the predictions of the quark models ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and with the result of the phenomenological analysis of the electroproduction data ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , confirm a dominance preservation of the magnetic dipole excitation of the @xmath103 resonance with the change of @xmath346 .",
    "quark models expand this situation to values of @xmath178 . in our dispersion model",
    ", it was verified that the compensation angle @xmath347 is invariable with @xmath3 for the cross sections of the processes @xmath348 with the transverse virtual photons at @xmath349 gev @xmath350 .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by the experiment @xcite for the timelike values of @xmath3 : @xmath351 . in the second and third resonance regions , the analysis of experimental data for electroproduction ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )",
    "gives a considerable change ( with @xmath352 ) of the helicity structure for the excitation of leading resonances , which is especially essential approximately at @xmath353 .",
    "the compensation curves exist also for the asymmetry in the charged pion production by the polarized @xmath354-quanta @xmath355/ [ d{\\sigma}_{\\perp}/dt + d{\\sigma}_{\\parallel}/dt]\\;.\\ ] ] for example , at @xmath356  gev the compensation in @xmath357 ( [ ph - asym ] ) takes place at @xmath358 for the @xmath359 photoproduction .",
    "since at high energies and small @xmath360 ebm ( as any reasonable model explaining the sharp forward peak in @xmath361 for the @xmath359 photoproduction ) gives the sign and size of @xmath362 in the forward direction , the compensation curves for @xmath362 above the resonance region go through approximately the same values of the angles @xmath363 as for @xmath364 .",
    "this fact is explained practically model independently .",
    "the plausibility of assumption that the compensation curves at high energies and small angles and at @xmath166 are not much different from the corresponding curves for @xmath25 is justified by successful application of ebm to the description of the processes of electroproduction and @xmath365 at high energies and @xmath366 @xcite . in any case , the compensation curves help one to reveal the optimal experimental conditions for studying the form factors @xmath367 and @xmath368 in processes of the pion electroproduction and ipe .",
