    "for the last several years , 4d @xmath8 supersymmetric models with an anomalous @xmath1 gauge symmetry and non - vanishing fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) @xmath3-term have been studied intensively , and many phenomenologically interesting aspects have been obtained .",
    "such anomalous @xmath1 gauge symmetries , in general , appear in 4d string models.@xcite this anomaly can be cancelled by the 4d green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "for example , in weakly coupled 4d heterotic string models , the 4d dilaton field @xmath9 is required to transform non - trivially at the one - loop level as @xmath10 under the @xmath1 transformation with the transformation parameter @xmath11 , where the green - schwarz coefficient is set as @xmath12 .",
    "then , a fi term @xmath13 is induced by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the dilaton field @xmath9 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ( 4d ) planck scale , and @xmath16 is the first derivative of the khler potential of the dilaton field . at the tree level",
    ", we have @xmath17 , and the vev of the dilaton field provides the 4d gauge coupling @xmath18 .",
    "the fi term is suppressed by the one - loop factor unless @xmath19 is quite large . in type",
    "i models , other singlet fields , i.e. moduli fields , also contribute to the 4d green - schwarz mechanism , and a fi term is induced by their vevs.@xcite thus , the magnitude of the fi term is arbitrary in type i models , while its value in heterotic models is one - loop suppressed in comparison with @xmath15 .",
    "some fields develop vevs along @xmath3-flat directions to cancel the fi term , and the anomalous @xmath1 gauge symmetry is broken around the energy scale @xmath20 , e.g. just below @xmath15 in heterotic models .",
    "hence , this anomalous @xmath1 gauge symmetry does not remain at low energy scales , although its discrete subsymmetry or the corresponding global symmetry may remain even at low energy scales .",
    "however , an anomalous @xmath1 with non - vanishing fi term would create phenomenologically interesting effects .",
    "actually , several applications of anomalous @xmath1 have been addressed .",
    "one interesting application is the generation of hierarchical yukawa couplings by the froggatt - nielsen mechanism.@xcite we could use higher - dimensional couplings as the origin of hierarchical fermion masses and mixing angles , where the ratio @xmath21 plays a role in the derivation of the mass ratios and mixing angles like that of the cabibbo angle.@xcite    another aspect of anomalous @xmath1 is that anomalous @xmath1 symmetry breaking induces @xmath3-term contributions to soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scalar masses.@xcite these @xmath3-term contributions are , in general , proportional to the @xmath1 charges , and their overall magnitude is on the order of other soft susy breaking scalar masses .",
    "thus , these @xmath3-term contributions become a new source of non - universal sfermion masses",
    ". this would be dangerous from the viewpoint of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "a type of susy breaking and the mechanism for its mediation by anomalous @xmath1 and the fi term has been proposed.@xcite ( see also ref .  @xcite . ) in this type of scenario , @xmath3-term contributions can be much larger than other soft scalar masses and gaugino masses . for example",
    ", in the case that only the top quark has vanishing @xmath1 charge , stop and gaugino masses can be @xmath22 gev , and the other sfermion masses can be @xmath23 tev .",
    "this type of sparticle spectrum can satisfy fcnc constraints as well as the naturalness problem , and actually , it corresponds to the decoupling solution for the susy flavor problem.@xcite however , with this type of spectrum , we must be careful in regard to two - loop renormalization group effects on stop masses , which could become tachyonic.@xcite    also , the fi term plays a role in the so - called @xmath3-term inflation scenario.@xcite other interesting behavior has been studied in models with anomalous @xmath1 and a nonvanishing fi term .",
    "in addition to these 4d models , which were studied several years ago , recently 5d @xmath2 models with the fi term were studied , and interesting behavior was found.@xcite-@xcite the @xmath2 extra dimension with radius @xmath24 has two fixed points , which we denote @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in general , we can put two independent fi terms on these two fixed points , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , susy breaking in the bulk is studied using the fi term . in refs .",
    "@xcite , zero - mode wave - function profiles are studied , and it is found that their profiles depend on the @xmath1 charges .",
    "hierarchical yukawa couplings have also been derived.@xcite in these models , the scalar field @xmath0 in the @xmath1 vector multiplet ( in the terminology of 5d @xmath8 susy ) plays an important role .",
    "in particular , bulk field profiles are studied systematically in ref .",
    "@xcite , which considers models in which the sum of the fi coefficients vanishes , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to a vanishing fi term in the 4d effective theory .",
    "the interesting behavior exhibited by 4d models mentioned above can exist for non - vanishing fi terms .",
    "therefore , here we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case with @xmath30 . actually , the susy breaking model of ref .",
    "@xcite and the yukawa hierarchy model of ref .",
    "@xcite have fi terms for which @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , our analysis includes those cases .",
    "we systematically study the vev of @xmath0 in the generic case that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent .",
    "then , we consider bulk field profiles . our result should be useful for further applications .    in this paper , we study the vev of @xmath0 with generic values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and we consider zero - mode wave - function profiles under the non - trivial vev of @xmath0 in the bulk .",
    "we also study mass eigenvalues and profiles of higher modes .",
    "these systematic analyses are the main purpose of this paper .",
    "in addition , we consider an application to susy breaking and examine the implication of @xmath3-term contributions to susy breaking scalar masses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we systematically study the question of along which direction vevs are developed in models with generic values of fi - terms .",
    "also , we consider the zero - mode profiles of bulk fields under non - trivial vev of @xmath33 as well as profiles and mass eigenvalues of higher modes . in  [ sec:3 ] , as an example of an application , we introduce a toy model for susy breaking and discuss the implication of @xmath3-term contributions to susy - breaking scalar masses .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a conclusion and discussion . in the appendix , we investigate profiles and mass eigenvalues of higher modes .",
    "we consider a 5d susy model on @xmath34 . because of orbifolding",
    ", susy is broken into @xmath8 susy , in terminology of 4d theory .",
    "our model includes a @xmath1 vector multiplet and charged hypermultiplets in the bulk .",
    "the 5d vector multiplet consists of a 5d vector field @xmath35 , gaugino fields @xmath36 , a real scalar field @xmath0 and a triplet of auxiliary fields @xmath37 .",
    "their @xmath38 parities are assigned in a way consistent with 4d @xmath8 susy and @xmath1 symmetry.@xcite for example , the @xmath38 parity of @xmath0 field as well as @xmath39 is assigned as odd .",
    "a 5d hypermultiplet consists of two complex scalar fields , @xmath40 , and their 4d superpartners as well as their auxiliary fields .",
    "the fields @xmath40 have @xmath38 parities @xmath41 , and the @xmath1 charge of the @xmath38 even field @xmath42 is denoted by @xmath43 , while the corresponding @xmath38 odd field has @xmath1 charge @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath38 odd fields should vanish at the fixed points ; e.g. , @xmath45 also the first derivatives of @xmath38 even fields along @xmath46 should vanish at the fixed points ; e.g. , @xmath47 in addition to these bulk fields , our model includes brane fields , i.e. 4d @xmath8 chiral multiplets on the two fixed points , and their scalar components are written @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 denotes two fixed points .",
    "their @xmath1 charges are denoted by @xmath51 . as a first step",
    ", we do not consider any superpotential on the fixed points .",
    "we consider the following fi terms on the fixed points : @xmath52 here we simply assume these fi terms . our analysis is purely classical .",
    "one - loop calculations are carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , and they show that the fi terms are generated at the one - loop level . and @xmath53 as well as delta - function forms as in eq .",
    "( [ 5d - fi ] ) . here",
    "we do not consider such fi terms , but we can extend our analysis to the case with @xmath54 and @xmath53 . ] for one - loop generated fi terms , the sum of fi coefficients @xmath55 is proportional to the sum of @xmath1 charges .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath30 , we have an anomaly , although such a case corresponds to the 4d models mentioned in the introduction , and we are interested in such a case .",
    "it is not clear whether or not some singlet fields ( brane / bulk moduli fields ) transform non - trivially under the @xmath1 transformation to cancel the anomaly and thereby generate fi terms like eqs .",
    "( [ gs - s ] ) and ( [ gs - fi ] ) .",
    "moreover , in what follows we discuss non - trivial profiles of bulk fields , and such profiles might change one - loop calculations of the fi term from the case with trivial profiles .",
    "therefore , let us just assume the above fi terms and study their aspects classically .",
    "putting all the above consideration together , the scalar potential terms relevant to our study are written @xcite @xmath56 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & |\\partial_y \\phi_+ -gq \\sigma \\phi_+|^2   +   |\\partial_y \\phi_- + gq \\sigma \\phi_-|^2   + g^2q^2|\\phi_+ \\phi_-|^2 + \\cdots , \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the 5d gauge coupling , which is related to @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "we have taken a vanishing bulk mass , @xmath60 , for @xmath61 .",
    "the first term corresponds to the @xmath3 term , and the other terms correspond to the @xmath62 terms .",
    "thus , the @xmath3-flat direction is written @xmath63 and the @xmath62-flat direction satisfies @xmath64 it is convenient to integrate eq .",
    "( [ d - flat ] ) , and the @xmath3-flat condition then becomes @xmath65 here we have used the boundary conditions @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "hereafter , we choose the signs of the @xmath1 charges @xmath43 and @xmath51 such that @xmath68 .",
    "we also denote the ratio of @xmath28 to @xmath27 as @xmath69 .",
    "one of important aspect of the present system is that when @xmath0 develops a vev , bulk masses of bulk matter fields are generated .",
    "when susy is not broken , the profiles of the zero modes of the @xmath38 even fields @xmath42 satisfy the equation @xmath70 that is , the profiles become @xmath71 .",
    "\\label{profile-1}\\ ] ] fermionic superpartners have the same profiles as the scalar fields ( [ profile-1 ] ) .",
    "if susy is broken and susy - breaking scalar masses are induced , the zero - mode profiles of the bulk scalar components would change , but the profiles of fermionic components do not change from their forms given in eq .",
    "( [ profile-1 ] ) . furthermore ,",
    "if susy - breaking scalar masses are constant in the bulk , zero - mode profiles of scalar components are not changed , but scalar mass eigenvalues are shifted from zero by susy - breaking scalar masses .",
    "thus , the vev of @xmath0 is important . in the following subsections , we study the vev of @xmath0 and zero - mode profiles as well as higher modes systematically .",
    "first , we consider the vev of @xmath38 odd bulk fields @xmath72 in the susy vacuum .",
    "the @xmath62-flat condition requires the vev of @xmath72 to satisfy the following equation : @xmath73 .",
    "\\label{vev - odd}\\ ] ] however , the @xmath38 odd bulk fields should satisfy the boundary condition @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that @xmath75 vanishes everywhere , unless @xmath76 has a singularity .",
    "thus , we consider vacua with @xmath77 in the unbroken susy case .",
    "also , for the broken susy case studied in  2.2.1 , we first consider the direction along @xmath77 , and then we discuss whether or not such a direction induces tachyonic masses for the first excited mode of @xmath38 odd bulk fields . note that the zero modes of @xmath38 odd bulk fields are projected out . the first excited mode has a kk mass ( e.g. , of @xmath78 ) . if the absolute value of negative @xmath3-term contributions to susy - breaking scalar ( masses)@xmath7 is larger than such kk ( mass)@xmath7 , @xmath38 odd bulk fields could also develop vevs .",
    "however , we show that such first excited modes of @xmath72 have non - tachyonic masses in the following section .",
    "thus , the vacuum with @xmath77 , which is studied in  2.2.1 , corresponds to a local minimum .",
    "first we consider the case that only @xmath0 develops a vev .",
    "this situation can be realized when @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the entire bulk and the brane fields except for @xmath38 odd bulk fields .",
    "varying @xmath0 , we obtain the minimization condition , @xmath83 .",
    "its solution is obtained as @xmath84 since @xmath0 is a @xmath38 odd field , it should satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath85 .",
    "the integral constant @xmath86 is obtained from the following equation : @xmath87 the left - hand side of this equation should vanish , because of the boundary condition of @xmath0 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath88 the vev @xmath89 itself is written @xmath90 in the region @xmath91 , where the function @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively . the case with @xmath31 and @xmath96",
    "is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the case with @xmath97 is studied in ref .",
    "thus , the above case includes those of these previous models .    only with the above vev of @xmath0",
    ", we have the vacuum energy @xmath98 thus , in general , susy is broken .",
    "however , in the case with @xmath29 , we have @xmath99 , and susy is unbroken .",
    "it is notable that even in the broken susy case , the vacuum energy is constant along the @xmath46 direction .",

    "note here , however , that scalar masses are shifted from zero by @xmath3-term contributions . the profile ( [ profile-2 ] ) is obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , and several aspects are discussed in ref .",

    "this localization point is independent of the @xmath1 charges ; that is , all of the zero modes are localized at the same point .",
    "for example , if @xmath107 , all of the zero modes are localized at the point @xmath108 . in some models the localization point may be outside the region @xmath109 $ ] , and in such cases , we see only the tail of the gaussian profile . even in the limit of a very large fi term ,",
    "i.e. @xmath110 , the ratio @xmath111 can be finite .",
    "however , the width of the gaussian profile depends on the @xmath1 charges @xmath43 .",
    "this should be useful , e.g. , to derive hierarchical couplings using wave - function overlapping .",
    "if we include a non - vanishing bulk mass @xmath112 , the zero - modes become localized at different points . for example , the term @xmath113 in the scalar potential ( [ potential ] ) changes as latexmath:[\\[|\\partial_y \\phi_+ -gq \\sigma \\phi_+|^2   \\rightarrow     introduce a non - vanishing bulk mass @xmath112 .",
    "this corresponds to a constant shift of @xmath115 by @xmath116 .",
    "then , the localization points of the gaussian profiles depend on the values of @xmath112 .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath60 , but the following analysis and results can be simply extended to the case with non - vanishing @xmath112 in a manner similar to that for the above constant shift of @xmath115 .",
    "the scalar zero mode has a susy - breaking scalar mass term due to the non - vanishing @xmath3 term in bulk @xmath117 which is constant along the @xmath46 direction , as stated above .",

    "similarly , the brane fields on both branes have the @xmath3-term contribution to susy - breaking scalar mass @xmath120 this @xmath3-term contribution is also positive in the present case with @xmath121 .",
    "there is no zero - mode with tachyonic mass .",
    "note that the overall magnitudes of @xmath3-term contributions to scalar masses are universal , up to @xmath1 charges in bulk and both branes .",
    "this point is considered again in  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "next , we discuss profiles and mass eigenvalues of the higher scalar modes @xmath40 . from the potential ( [ potential ] ) , we have a @xmath61 square term after @xmath0 develops a vev @xmath89 .",

    "we assume the mass term of @xmath206 in the superpotential to be @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the brane field on @xmath25 and has @xmath1 charge @xmath211 .",

    "a bulk field could play the same role as that of the brane field @xmath210 , and we would obtain the same result . in this case",
