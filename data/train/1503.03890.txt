    "information on the branch of the contour is provided by the two - side feynman diagrams ( the keldysh contour diagrams with additional restriction on the relative positions of times with respect to the real time axis ) .",
    "it is customary to indicate each photon process by separate arrow in these diagrams , rather than consider contractions representing free photon propagation .",
    "the agreement is that arrow pointing to the left corresponds to creation operator of the photon in quantum mechanical description of the field ( or factor @xmath58 for classical treatment of the field ) , while arrow pointing to the right represents operator of annihilation of the photon ( or factor @xmath59 )  @xcite .",
    "the procedure being applied to expression ( [ jif ] ) leads to @xmath60 double - sided feynman diagrams presented in fig .",

    "comparison of the two sets of diagrams is straightforward , when one keeps in mind an additional restriction on time ordering within the liouville space formulation ( ordering not only on the contour but also with respect to real time axis ) .",
    "so , one hilbert space type diagram ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) may encompass several diagrams of the liouville type ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "diagram - to - diagram correspondence is shown in fig .",
    "in realistic simulations in junctions in addition to molecular interaction with radiation field other intra - molecular interactions ( e.g. electron - electron or electron - phonon ) and couplings to environment ( e.g. coupling to contacts ) should be accounted for .",
    "quasiparticles approaches ( in either hilbert or liouville space ) are usually efficient in treating molecule - contacts couplings . indeed , since the latter are represented as quadratic in terms of elementary excitations , eq .",
    "( [ vsb ] ) , they do not alter non - interacting character of the hamiltonian , and thus wick s theorem is available to exactly evaluate multi - time correlation functions in presence of the couplings  @xcite .",
    "however , quasiparticles are less convenient when dealing with intra - molecular interactions .",
    "that is , if intra - molecular interactions are weak compared to either molecule - contacts couplings or separation between electron energy from molecular resonances , standard diagrammatic technique ( on the contour perturbation theory ) can be invoked to account approximately for the interactions .    for strong interactions ( e.g. coulomb blockade or polaron formation ) usually encountered in the resonant tunneling regime ,",
    "a nonequilibirum atomic limit ( i.e. consideration utilizing many - body states of the isolated molecule as a basis ) is preferable  @xcite .",
    "note that historically spectroscopy of isolated molecules also was formulated mostly in the language of many - body states ( molecular or dressed states of molecule and the field )  @xcite .",
    "many - body states based formulations , while accounting exactly for intra - molecular interactions , are capable of treating molecule - contacts couplings only approximately .",
    "we note that such approximate schemes exist for both hilbert  @xcite and liouville  @xcite space formulations , however these approximations are not well controlled .",
    "a promising tool is the hilbert space type pseudoparticle negf ( pp - negf ) technique  @xcite , which while being a many - body states formulation allows to take into account coupling to the contacts within well controllable diagrammatic technique , which is based on extension of the standard methods of quantum field theory into extended version of the hilbert space .",
    "the pp - negf has several important advantages : 1 .",
    "the method is conceptually simple ; 2 .",
    "its practical implementations rely on a set of controlled approximations ( standard diagrammatic perturbation theory techniques can be applied ) ; 3 . already in its simplest implementation , the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , the pseudoparticle negf goes beyond standard qme approaches by accounting for both non - markovian effects and hybridization of molecular states ; 4 .",
    "the method is capable of treating junction problems in the language of many - body states of the isolated molecule , exactly accounting for all the on - the - molecule interactions .",
    "recently a first application of the methodology to problems of optical spectroscopy of junctions was proposed in ref .  .",
    "( [ jif ] ) represents all contributions to the fourth order optical process .",
    "note that interaction with mode @xmath45 only includes outgoing photon , while interactions with mode @xmath46 have both incoming and outgoing photon contributions .",
    "correspondingly , the projections can be separated into those containing two outgoing photons ( diagrams b in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and those which contain incoming photon of mode @xmath46 and outgoing photon of mode @xmath45 ( diagrams a in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . the former contribute to fluorescence ( both coherent fourth order and sequential second order processes ) , while the latter yield raman ( see below ) and absorption with emission ( sequential second order ) processes .    both diagrams a and b of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] contain virtual photon processes .",
    "for example , interaction with mode @xmath46 in projections ( a4 ) ( a type diagram ) and ( a1 ) ( b type diagram ) of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are virtual photon processes .",
    "these processes yield renormalization of molecular correlation functions due to presence of the radiation field .",
    "accounting for such processes within the procedure described above should be done with care .",
    "indeed , reasonable estimate of the interaction with the field is @xmath61  ev  @xcite . for a molecule chemisorbed on metallic surface electronic escape rate ( characteristic strength of the molecule - contact interaction )",
    "is @xmath62  ev  @xcite , and in this case renormalizations due to coupling to contacts are much more pronounced . for a molecule detached from contacts renormalizations due to the radiation field become important , however proper way to account for those is by solving eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) .",
    "accouting for the renormalization by keeping only second term in the right of eq .",
    "( [ pt ] ) ( besides being a non - conserving approximation ) results in a green function divergent at molecular resonances .",
    "resummation of the perturbation series and introduction of the retarded projection of the self - energy is the proper way to account for the renormalization , when coupling to the radiation field is weak relative to intra - molecular interactions .",
    "if coupling to the radiation field is the dominating interaction , perturbation series treatment becomes invalid .",
    "we stress that in experiment one deals with the total optical signal , and a proper theoretical treatment should utilize eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) with conserving approximations employed to evaluate molecular green functions .",
    "we now focus on theoretical description of a particular optical process - the raman scattering .",
    "raman scattering from mode @xmath46 to mode @xmath45 is a coherent process of ( at least ) fourth order in coupling to radiation field with two orders in coupling to incoming photon of mode @xmath46 and two orders in coupling to outgoing photon of mode @xmath45 . the process should also satisfy a proper energy conservation : at steady - state difference between incoming and outgoing photon frequencies should be equal to multiples of the frequency of molecular vibration ( may be plus electronic energy differences within the same electronic level or many - body state broadened by coupling to environment ) @xmath63 here @xmath64 is integer number ( @xmath65 yields rayleigh scattering ) and @xmath66 is electronic energy change within the same broadened level or many - body state .",
    "identification of diagramms related to raman scattering requires some care .",
    "an easy way to identify relevant contributions relies on the hilbert space formulation of section  [ hilbert_liouv ] with utilization of the langreth projection rules  @xcite .",
    "first , only projections a of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are those corresponding to a process with one incoming and one outgoing photon .",
    "second , among those only parts of projections a2 , a3 , a4 , and a5 yield proper energy conservation , eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) .",
    "for example , let employ the langreth rules to projection a4 .",
    "this yields 4 terms in expression ( [ jif ] )    [ integral ] @xmath67    only ( [ eqraman ] ) yields proper energy conservation .",
    "similarly , application of the langreth rules to projection a3 yields one , and to projections a2 and a5 yields two integrals for each with only one term in each case satisfying restrictions of the raman process .    in refs .",
    "we presented a theory of raman scattering in molecular junctions formulated within the negf ( the hilbert space quasiparticle formulation ) .",
    "projections presented there were different from those given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in two aspects : a.  the projections there are given after the langreth rules have been applied and b.  some of the projections ( see e.g. fig .",
    "8b of ref .  ) represent ` the hole view ' of scattering process .",
    "we note that in general ( when explicit time - dependent processes or a magnetic field are present ) the latter flexibility does not exist .",
    "however for steady - state situation the two pictures can be shown to be equivalent .",
    "for example , the contribution ( [ eqraman ] ) to the raman signal is ( note , it is easy to see that the contribution is real following the derivation leading form eq.(28 ) to eq.(56 ) in ref .  ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the population of the mode @xmath46 .",

    "we note that while the results are equivalent , graphical forms of the projections differ : fig .  8b of ref .",
    "has the two incoming field modes on different branches , while the diagram a4 - on the same branch .",
    "we discussed theoretical formulations utilized in studies of optical processes in current carrying molecular junctions .",
    "we start by identifying total optical signal as photon flux from the system to registering device , for which exact formulation in terms of molecular correlation ( green ) functions is available .",
    "standard quantum field theory methods allow to formulate well controlled conserving approximation to evaluate the green functions of the molecule . at the same time tradition coming from the theory of optical spectroscopy for isolated molecules",
    "utilizes perturbation theory .",
    "the latter , while not being a conserving approximation , allows to separate different photon scattering events in the total optical signal .",
    "we discussed the hilbert and liouville space formulations , indicating similarities and differences in graphical representations of photon scattering process in the two formulations .",
    "we also pointed out strong and weak sides of quasiparticles ( second quantization ) vs. many - body states based ( nonequilibrium atomic limit ) approaches in both formulations , and outlined the pp - negf as a promising theoretical approach to study optical spectroscopy in junctions .",
