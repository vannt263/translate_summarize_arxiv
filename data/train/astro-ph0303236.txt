    "the cosmological reionization process is likely to be quite complex ( e.g. , barkana & loeb 2001 ; madau 2002 ; wyithe & loeb 2003a ; mackey , bromm , & hernquist 2002 ; cen 2003 ; venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ) .",
    "it seems rather remarkable that we can now start observationally probing this process .",
    "a major milestone was laid down by the recent observations of high redshift quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , indicating that the final reionization episode came to completion at @xmath0 ( e.g. , fan et al .",
    "2001 ; becker et al .  2001 ; barkana 2002 ; cen & mcdonald 2002 ; litz et al .",
    "2002 ) . given the final reionization epoch and the fact that the density fluctuations at that epoch is sufficiently well constrained in the context of the standard cold dark matter model ( bahcall et al .",
    "1999 ) , it becomes possible to show ( cen 2003 ) , under reasonable assumptions , that the universe has been reionized twice , first reionized at @xmath11 by metal - free , massive population iii ( pop iii ) stars and second reionized at @xmath12 , _ provided that pop iii imf is top - heavy_. in this picture a larger thomson optical depth , @xmath13 , was expected .",
    "another major milestone was set very recently by the wmap polarization observations , which probes the ionization state of the gas in the universe at high redshift during the cosmological reionization period .",
    "the wmap observations measured @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) ( kogut et al .  2003 ) .",
    "one can immediately draw the conclusion that the universe did not just experience an impulsive reionization event at @xmath0 , which would have yielded @xmath14 , in the standard cosmological constant dominated cold dark matter model . evidently , the universe became ( and possibly had to stay ) significantly ionized from a much higher redshift , probably from @xmath11 . in this _",
    "letter _ we compute the detailed reionization process and compare to wmap observations , investigating what can be learned about pop iii star formation processes at high redshift .",
    "a spatially flat cold dark matter cosmological model with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19km / s / mpc , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , symbolized as lcdmap model , is used .",
    "this model is the best fit model constrained by wmap observations with a fixed power - law index ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . to set a plausible upper bound",
    "we also compute a model with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , denoted as lcdmap+ model , which is consistent with current wmap data ( spergel et al .",
    "2002 ) and maximizes the small - scale structures responsible for the reionization process .",
    "we employ an efficient method to compute the coupled evolution of gas and star formation in the high redshift universe , described in  4 of cen ( 2003 ) , which simultaneously computes the dynamic evolution of all gaseous phases including hii regions , hi regions and partially ionized regions .",
    "such a careful treatment is necessary given the various short time scales involved at high redshift for important processes , including recombination and cooling . throughout ,",
    "pop iii stars are defined to be metal - free stars with a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) and pop iii galaxies are defined to be galaxies where pop iii stars form .",
    "we define  minihalos \" as those whose virial temperature is less than @xmath24k where only 2 cooling is possible in the absence of metals , and large halos as those with virial temperature above @xmath24k capable of cooling via atomic lines .",
    "the most important factors determining the ionization process are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the star formation efficiency , defined as the fraction of gas in halos formed into stars ; @xmath28 is the fraction of ionizing photons that escapes from galaxy halos and gets into the igm ; @xmath26 is the clumping factor of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "basically , @xmath29 is the source of ionizing photons from stars in galaxies and @xmath26 determines the sink of ionizing photons due to the igm .",
    "the competition between the two primarily dictates the ionization state of the igm .",
    "the initial phase of ionization front propagating through neutral medium does not play a significant role near the end of the reionization process , and cosmological effects are unimportant throughout the reionization period .",
    "but all these processes are included in the calculation . theoretically , @xmath26 is reasonably well determined , if we adopt the standard cold dark matter cosmological model .",
    "in addition , @xmath26 may be constrained directly by observations of quasar absorption spectra at redshifts close to @xmath12 ( e.g. , cen & mcdonald 2002 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "2001 ; cen & haiman 2000 ) .",
    "we set the igm clumping factor at @xmath12 to be @xmath30 , according to gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , which requires @xmath31 with the adopted cosmological model ( see cen 2003 for discussion ) .",
    "results do not sensitively depend on @xmath26 at @xmath12 ; for example , a change in @xmath26 at @xmath12 by @xmath32 only causes @xmath33 change in @xmath15 .",
    "both theoretically and observationally , our direct knowledge of @xmath29 for high redshift galaxies is very little .",
    "however , as pointed out in cen ( 2003 ) , the fact that the universal reionization ends just at @xmath0 , as observations seem to indicate ( e.g. , fan et al .  2001 ; becker et al .  2001 ;",
    "barkana 2002 ; cen & mcdonald 2002 ; litz et al .",
    "2002 ) , tightly constrains @xmath29 , knowing @xmath26 .",
    "such a normalization point is proven to be very powerful and unambiguously determines @xmath29 at @xmath0 ( see figure 7 of cen 2003 ) for pop ii stars , which are likely responsible for completing the long reionization process at @xmath0 .",
    "for all the models computed below , the normalization at @xmath12 requires @xmath34 for pop ii galaxies at @xmath0 . for models",

    "models # 3,4 have a pop iii star formation efficiency in minihalos @xmath48 , suggested by numerical simulations of abel , bryan & norman ( 2002 ) with a reasonable star formation efficiency for pop iii galaxies with large halos of @xmath49 , for lcdmap and lcdmap+ model , respectively .",
    "models # 5,6 assume a higher pop iii star formation efficiency in minihalos @xmath50 , for lcdmap and lcdmap+ model , respectively ; in this case , ionizing photons from pop iii minihalos dominate over those from pop iii large halos for the first reionization process , regardless of the value of @xmath43 .",
    "model # 7 is similar to models # 1 , except that in the former we arbitrarily set the transition epoch from pop iii to pop ii at the time when a fraction @xmath51 of total gas has formed pop iii stars instead of @xmath52 in the latter set .",
    "we note that @xmath52 is derived based on the assumption that most of the pop iii metal - free massive stars experience supernovae and most of the ejected metals get out of galaxies to enrich the igm ( oh et al .",
    "2001 ; cen 2003 ) .",
    "if , for some reason , the fractional amount of metals enriching the igm is significantly smaller than the amount of gas formed into massive stars , the efficiency of metal enrichment by pop iii stars would be lower ; model # 7 serves to illustrate this possibility .",
    "possible physical processes that may reduce the metal enrichment efficiency include a large fraction of pop iii stars being very massive stars ( @xmath53 ) which may collapse to black holes instead of exploding as supernovae ( rakavy , shaviv , & zinamon 1967 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; glatzel , fricke , & el eid 1985 ; woosley 1986 ) or not all ejected metals are able to be transported to igm .",
    "we note that model # 1 is close to the model used in cen ( 2003 ) , having perhaps more conventional ( thus thought to be more reasonable ) values for the relevant parameters .",
    "we also test a variant of model # 1 by using @xmath54 instead of being constant with redshift and find @xmath55 for that case versus @xmath56 for a constant @xmath35 ( model # 1 ) .    from table 1",
    "we can draw several conclusions .",
    "first , without pop iii stars ( models # 1,2 ) , it is likely that @xmath57 for both lcdmap and lcdmap+ models , inconsistent with wmap results at @xmath58 level ( kogut et al .",
    "the conclusions reached here with regard to the requirement of a top - heavy imf for pop iii stars in order to explain the observed high @xmath15 value are consistent with those by wyithe & loeb ( 2003b ) , haiman & holder ( 2003 ) and sokasian et al .  ( 2003 ) .",
    "second , for reasonable ranges for the star formation efficiency [ @xmath59 , @xmath60 and ionizing photon escape fraction ( @xmath61 ) from pop iii galaxies , we expect that @xmath5 for lcdmap model ( model # 3 ) and @xmath62 for lcdmap+ model ( model # 4 ) .",
    "third , prolonging the pop iii era by making the metal enrichment of the igm from pop iii galaxies less efficient increases the thomson optical depth incrementally .",
    "finally , while @xmath63 is the mean value determined by wmap observations , it seems hard to reach in the lcdmap model .",
    "there are two possible ways to achieve a thomson optical depth as high as @xmath64 : either the ionizing photon escape fraction is large ( @xmath65 ) and the underlying cosmological model has a blue power spectrum with a positive tilt to @xmath9 ( model # 5 ) or pop iii star formation efficiency in minihalos is substantially larger than current simulations seem to indicate , requiring @xmath10",
    ".    figures 1,2 show the reionization history and cumulative thomson optical depth , respectively , for four representative models listed in table 1 .",
    "we see that without pop iii stars ( model # 1 ) reionization event only occurs once at @xmath0 and the reionization history is monotonic . with pop iii stars",
    "the first reionization occurs at @xmath66 ( models # 3,4 ) . in the last case ( model # 5 ) where pop iii star formation efficiency in minihalos is substantially larger than suggested by current simulations of abel , bryan & norman ( 2002 ) , @xmath67 versus @xmath68 ,",
    "the first reionization occurs at @xmath69 .",
    "while both model # 4 and model # 5 have comparable total thomson optical depth , @xmath70 , their respective reionization histories at early times ( @xmath11 ) are somewhat different .",
    "we find that for models # 4 , minihalos and large halos contribute to 62% and 38% of all ionizing photons to reionize the universe at the first time , by which 9 ionizing photons per baryon have been produced ; the corresponding numbers for model # 5 are 61% , 39% and 11 photons per baryon .",
    "in contrast , for model # 3 , minihalos and large halos contribute to 20% and 80% of all ionizing photons to the first reionization and 6 ionizing photons per baryon have been produced by then .",
    "we see , as expected , that an earlier first reionization requires a larger number of ionizing photons per baryons and a larger contribution from minihalos appears likely if the first reionization occurs at @xmath71 in the context of the currently favored @xmath72 cosmology .",
    "it is possible that future cmb experiments such as planck survey might be able to distinguish between these two scenarios ( e.g. , holder et al .",
    "we will defer a more detailed analysis of this aspect to a separate paper .",
    "since it appears that a significant fraction ( @xmath73 ) of ionizing photons produced by pop iii galaxies is required to escape from galaxies in order to sufficiently ionize the universe to be consistent with wmap observations , it is worthwhile to check what kind of escape fraction is possible .",
    "here we give an order of magnitude assessment of the situation . if a fraction , @xmath74 , of gas in a high redshift pop iii galaxy formed into very massive stars emitting at @xmath75 hydrogen ionizing photons per solar mass of stars per second ( e.g. , bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) , then we can obtain the ratio of the total number of hydrogen ionizing photons emitted during the @xmath76 yrs of lifetime of the pop iii galaxy ( assumed to be equal to the lifetime of the pop iii massive stars ) to the number of baryons in the galaxy , @xmath77 it can also be shown that the ratio of the number of recombinations of hydrogen atoms ( assuming a temperature of @xmath78k at @xmath79 ) to the number of baryons in the galaxy is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the effective clumping factor of the gas in the galaxy , taking into account all possible effects including shielding and clumpiness .",
    "thus , the ratio of the total number of ionizing photons to the total number of recombinations of hydrogen atoms during the lifetime of the galaxy at redshift @xmath79 is @xmath82 the time it takes for the ionization front from very massive pop iii stars to break out is roughly @xmath83 which is clearly much shorter than the lifetime of the galaxy . in equation ( 4 )",
    "@xmath84 is the amount of pop iii stars formed , @xmath85 the size of the galaxy disk and @xmath8 the interstellar medium density .",
    "thus , ionization of the gas inside the galaxy may be treated as instantaneous and the ratio in equation ( 3 ) is an instructive gauge .",
    "if @xmath86 , as appears to be required ( as discussed in  2 ) in order to produce a large enough @xmath15 ( @xmath87 ) to be consistent with wmap observations , then equation ( 3 ) implies that @xmath88 has to be less than @xmath89 in order for a significant fraction of ionizing photons to escape from galaxy halos .",
    "on one hand , if the clumping factor is dominated by gas in the halo with overdensity of order @xmath90 , @xmath88 could be less than @xmath89 .",
    "on the other hand , the gas on the disk or at radii much smaller than the virial radius would be much denser and their contribution to the clumping factor would critically depend on the density , geometry and self - shielding effects .",
    "a reliable estimate of the escape fraction for ionizing photons is unattainable without detailed modeling .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that it is not entirely impossible to have a significant fraction of ionizing photons escape under special conditions .",
    "possible favorable scenarios include a large fraction of star formation activities occur at a substantial height above the galactic disk and/or off - center within star formation sites embedded in very clumpy interstellar medium .",
    "it is clearly seen from the above analysis that the smaller the value of @xmath74 , the less likely that a significant fraction of ionizing photon can escape .",
    "consequently , a high pop iii star formation efficiency may be the key to a high overall ionizing photon production rate in pop iii galaxies with respect to the receiving igm , with the latter depending on the former in a probably nonlinear way .",
    "the question is then : how high can @xmath74 be ?    the simulation by abel , bryan & norman ( 2002 ; see also bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ) for a halo of mass @xmath91 with @xmath92 baryons forms a massive star of mass @xmath93 at the center .",
    "this would give a star formation efficiency of @xmath94 , taken at face value , which is much smaller than required value of order @xmath67 .",
    "for a discussion why pop iii star formation in minihalos may continue unimpeded throughout the pop iii era , see cen ( 2003 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath95 required for pop iii stars in large halos to ionize the universe at @xmath66 is still higher by a factor of ten .",
    "it should be pointed out that that the central protostar in the abel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) simulation appears to be still accreting matter rapidly at the end of their simulation , so it is possible that the stellar mass may grow substantially .",
    "we also note , however , that their simulated galaxy has a virial temperature below @xmath96k hence does not possess the efficient atomic cooling .",
    "it is possible that , for galaxies with efficient atomic cooling , star formation efficiency may be much higher than what abel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) simulation indicates .",
    "detailed simulations will be invaluable .",
    "finally , we note that , if star formation in cooling shells produced by exploding massive pop iii stars , the  pop ii.5 \" stars proposed by mackey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , is efficient , they may make a non - negligible contribution to the pool of ionizing photons .",
    "these stars might form at off - center locations and thus might possess a relatively larger ionizing photon escape fraction .",
    "the counteracting factor is that these stars might be substantially less massive than the first generation metal - free stars , since the metallicity of the gas in the cooling shells may be quite high , hence are less efficient ionizing photon emitters .",
    "adopting the best fit standard cold dark matter model with a fixed power - law index by wmap observations with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19km / s / mpc , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and based on the observed thomson optical depth due to intergalactic medium by wmap ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) , we are able to draw several relatively secure conclusions with regard to pop iii star formation processes at very high redshift .",
    "\\(1 ) the combination of the normal salpeter imf for pop iii metal - free stars and the absence of a dramatic upturn in the star formation efficiency and/or ionizing photon escape fraction at high redshift ( @xmath3 ) would produce a thomson optical depth due to igm at reionization of @xmath4 , inconsistent with the observed @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) at @xmath58 level .",
    "\\(2 ) a top - heavy imf for the pop iii metal - free stars and plausible star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape , as gauged by the corresponding values for pop ii galaxies required in order to achieve the second reionization finale at @xmath0 yield @xmath5 ;      \\(4 ) it seems quite improbable to reach @xmath7 even with very massive pop iii metal - free stars , unless ( i ) the cosmological model power index @xmath8 is positively tilted to @xmath9 and/or ( ii ) pop iii star formation in minihalos with molecular hydrogen cooling has an efficiency @xmath10 ( still requiring ionizing photon escape fraction greater than @xmath97 ) or ( iii ) alternatively , there may be unknown , non - stellar ionizing sources at very high redshift in the context of the @xmath72cdm cosmology .",
    "it is expected that the errorbars on the detected thomson optical depth should shrink significantly with time using more data .",
    "thus , if the current observed value of thomson optical depth ( @xmath98 - currently @xmath99 lower bound ) withstands future data , we will have strong observational evidence for the existence of massive metal - free pop iii stars .",
    "one possible outcome will be that @xmath100 ( @xmath101 away from the current observed central value ) , in which case no drastic increase in the star formation efficiency in pop iii galaxies would be needed .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath64 is firmed up in the future , there will be a degeneracy between possible competing scenarios .",
    "future cmb experiments such as the planck surveyor may be able to distinguish between them .",
    "on the theoretical side , more accurate calculations of pop iii metal - free star formation in both minihalos and large halos will be extremely useful to shed light on these vital parameters .",
