    "in the last several years , much study has been made with the use of nonextensive statistics ( nes ) which was initiated by tsallis @xcite .",
    "when the physical quantity @xmath17 of a system consisting of @xmath6 particles is expressed by @xmath18 , it is called intensive for @xmath19 , extensive for @xmath20 , and nonextensive for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for example , in a spatially homogenous @xmath23-dimensional classical gas with the attractive interaction decaying as @xmath24 , we get @xmath25 for @xmath26 ( nonextensive ) and @xmath20 for @xmath27 ( extensive ) @xcite .",
    "the nonextensivity is generally realized when the range of interactions is long enough compared to the linear size of the system .",
    "then small - scale systems may be nonextensive even when the interaction is not long - ranged one .",
    "tsallis has proposed the nes entropy given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath13 is the boltzman constant , @xmath5 the entropic index , and @xmath15 the probability density of the _ i_th state .",
    "note that the entropy of bgs is obtained from eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the limit of @xmath29 .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 expresses the measure of the nonextensivity .",
    "the nes has been successfully applied to a wide range of nonextensive systems including physics , chemistry , mathematics , astronomy , geophysics , biology , medicine , economics , engineering , linguistics , and others @xcite .    in our previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have applied the nes to _ hubbard dimers _ described by the two - site hubbard model .",
    "the hubbard model is one of the most important models in solid - state physics ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "the hubbard model consists of the tight - binding term expressing electron hoppings and the short - range interaction term between two electrons with opposite spins .",
    "the hubbard model provides us with good qualitative description for many interesting phenomena such as magnetism , electron correlation , and superconductivity .",
    "in particular , the hubbard model has been widely employed for a study on transition - metal magnetism .",
    "thermodynamical properties of grand - canonical ensembles of a single hubbard dimer have been calculated within the nes @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that specific heat and susceptibility calculated by the nes may be significantly different from those calculated by the boltzman - gibbs statistics ( bgs ) when the entropic index @xmath5 departs from unity , the nes with @xmath29 reducing to the bgs .",
    "it is interesting to compare the calculated results with experimental data .",
    "however , experimental data for a single dimer as adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not available in actual experiments .",
    "usually experiments on nanosystems are performed on samples which include many clusters consisting of , for example , multiples dimers ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "iron @xmath31 dimers ( fe2 ) in @xmath32_2 $ ] @xcite have the nonmagnetic , singlet ground state and their thermodynamical property has been analyzed with the use of the heisenberg model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "similar analysis has been made for transition - metal dimers of v2 @xcite , cr2 @xcite , co2 @xcite , ni2 @xcite and cu2 @xcite .",
    "some charge - transfer salts like tetracyanoquinodimethan ( tcnq ) with dimerized structures , have been analyzed by using the two - site hubbard model within the bgs @xcite .",
    "their susceptibility and specific heat were studied by taking into account the interdimer hopping , whose effect is negligibly small @xcite .",
    "such procedure may be justified within the bgs where the specific heat and susceptibility are treated as the extensive quantities : macroscopic measurements are expected to reflect the property of a constituting dimer .",

    "( 2 ) it is not clear in the current nes how to relate the physical temperature @xmath9 to the lagrange multiplier @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the following two methods have been so far proposed : @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the method a proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the same as the bgs .",
    "the method b is introduced so as to satisfy the _ zero_th law of thermodynamical principles and the generalized legendre transformations @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the negative specific heat of a classical gas model which is realized in the method a @xcite , is remedied in the method b @xcite .",
    "the specific heat and susceptibility calculated by the two methods a and b are qualitatively similar , but quantitatively different : the nonextensivity calculated by the method a is generally more significant than that calculated by the method b @xcite . in particular , the curie constant of the hubbard model in the limit of vanishing couplings calculated by the method a becomes spuriously large @xcite while that calculated by the method b is reasonable @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the result for localized free spins @xcite . in order to get more insight to the unsettled issue on the @xmath40 relation ,",
