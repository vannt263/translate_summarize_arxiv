    "an important theme in the study of @xmath7 and its subgroups is the close relationship between algebraic properties of @xmath7 ( e.g.  cohomology , finiteness properties , automorphisms , etc . )  and the structure of @xmath8-submanifolds of @xmath9 .",
    "the combinatorics of these @xmath8-submanifolds have been encoded in the structure of a number of simplicial complexes , such as the curve complex and the pants complex .",
    "a key property of these complexes is that they are often highly connected . in this paper",
    ", we discuss a general trick which yields simple proofs that complexes of this sort are connected or simply connected ; in many cases this is sufficient for the applications .    in the past , these sorts of theorems have been proven using a variety of tools , such as curve surgery ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , parametrized morse theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and teichmller theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we instead exploit the basic combinatorial group theoretic properties of @xmath6 and its subgroups , deducing that complexes are connected from the structure of generating sets and deducing that they are simply connected from relations .",
    "of course , we may be accused of circular reasoning , as the standard construction of generators and relations for @xmath7 involves investigating connected and simply connected complexes upon which it acts !",
    "the point of this paper is that this only needs to be done once  as soon as generators and relations for @xmath7 are found , one can prove that essentially any complex upon which @xmath7 acts in a reasonable way is connected or simply connected by a formal , finitely checkable ( and in practice quite easy ) process .",

    "<S> this note is devoted to a trick which yields almost trivial proofs that certain complexes associated to topological surfaces are connected or simply connected . </S>",
