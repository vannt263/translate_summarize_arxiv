    "the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) plays a special role in current searches of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the low energy flavor physics puts extremely tight bounds on possible non - standard model contributions to the nedm , and in particular special attention has been paid to new sources of cp violation .",
    "the nedm gives a great opportunity to learn about additional sources of cp violation .",
    "there are many studies on the nedm ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to cp violating effects , the nedm still offers many puzzles for the study of non - perturbative qcd effects within the sm .",
    "measurements of the cp asymmetry in @xmath2 larger than sm expectations have attracted many theoretical studies .",
    "the lhcb collaboration recently updated their analysis leading to a decreased value of the world average cp asymmetry @xcite : @xmath3 with @xmath4 and the definition @xmath5 many theoretical studies were performed in order to explain the apparent discrepancy @xcite .",
    "some of these approaches have explained the observed asymmetry by sm effects @xcite , as already indicated some time ago @xcite , while others have considered , possible new physics ( np ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors argued that penguin contraction power corrections might significant enhance the decay amplitudes .",
    "they also found that the same mechanism might consistently explain the branching ratios for singly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath6 decays .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that most likely the effective operators explaining cp asymmetry in charm decays are color - magnetic dipole operators , although color octet scalar as well as two higgs doublet models in specific parameter space are still allowed options @xcite .",
    "the important result of these studies @xcite is that apparently one needs an additional source of cp violation and in particular in the charm sector . on the other hand ,",
    "cp violation in the @xmath7 system has been related to the nedm @xcite , while in @xcite cp violation in @xmath8 oscillation was related to the nedm . in the study of the nedm usually the lowest dimensional operators were considered @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite found that higher dimensional operators might lead to rather important contributions to nedm , as noticed some time ago in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite also noticed @xcite that cp violation in charm decays can induce an increase of the nedm , if these higher dimensional operators are included .",
    "it should also be noted that several authors have recently considered the nedm within frameworks beyond the sm;- see for instance refs .",

    "the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) coming from down - like quark sectors are very well known and constrained by experiment .",

    "the strongest bound on new cp violating parameters comes from @xmath17 decay @xcite : @xmath18 .    using the constraint from charm decays ( [ e1 ] ) , we consider contributions of the additional heavy colored scalar meson to the nedm . as a particular example we consider a color octet , weak doublet scalar introduced in ref .",
    "these authors have analyzed a model with the most general scalar structure of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the main request on the model in @xcite was that it maintains the smallness of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , or in another words it is a model which fulfills principles of mfv .",
    "the new scalar state might contain a new source of cp violation .",
    "the phenomenology of sm modified by the presence of the color octet scalar state was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the constraints on of the color octet scalar coupling to up - type of quarks that arises from precision electroweak data on @xmath19 in @xmath20 decays , have been considered in @xcite .",
    "this study is not constraining the mass of the color - octet .",

    "iii is devoted to the study of nedm contributions obtained within a modified color octet model @xcite which produces cp violation in charm at tree level . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss obtained results .",
    "the nedm has been studied for many years , both within and beyond the sm ( for a review see @xcite ) . as it turned out that edms in the sm were small ,",
    "calculations within new physics scenarios were also performed . to obtain a cp violating amplitude within the sm ,",
    "two weak interactions are needed , and at least one of these must be a penguin - like interaction .",
    "the edms of single quarks , which are three loop diagrams with double gim - cancellations and at least one gluon exchange , are of order @xmath36 and proportional to quark masses and an imaginary ckm factor . a typical diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm3loop ] .",
    "however , in the sm , edms of single quarks were found to be very small , namely of order @xmath37 cm according to studies of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was shown that a mechanism with interplay of weak and strong interactions would give a nonzero contribution .",
    "typically , such amplitudes were written as baryon poles with two weak interactions , an ordinary w - exchange and a cp - violating penguin interaction , with for instance a negative parity strange baryon as intermediate baryon , and a soft photon emitted from somewhere @xcite .",
    "there were also contributions due to amplitudes at baryonic / mesonic level where the photon was emitted from an intermediate pion or kaon within a chiral loop @xcite .",
    "within such mechanisms , the @xmath38 was estimated to be of order @xmath39 to @xmath40 cm .",
    "it was pointed out that if the pole diagrams were interpreted at quark level it would correspond to a `` diquark mechanism '' @xcite .",
    "this means a cp - violating two loop diagram for the quark process @xmath41 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm2loop ] .    here",
    "the contribution was obtained in terms of a two loop factor proportional to @xmath36,and a ckm factor , written as @xmath42 .",

    "the nedm is suppressed by a small hadronic matrix element , but had logarithmic gim instead of power - like , compensating for hadronic suppression .    using the operator product expansion technique",
    ", one might consider operators of higher dimensions .",
    "recently , it was found @xcite that a tree - level higher dimensional operator might give a significant contribution to the nedm comparable to the loop induced contributions .",
    "their contribution is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopless ] .    the operator in ( [ efflag ] ) has dimension five and it is the lowest dimension operator in sm , if the @xmath49 problem in qcd is rotated away as described in ref .",

    "however , operators of higher dimension , as the well - known weinberg operator @xcite @xmath51 contribute significantlly to the nedm @xcite . an additional dimension six operator is @xmath52 which has been considered in ref .",
    "there are also so - called barr - zee contributions @xcite on the two loop level contributing to the nedm within the sm , being competitive in size with the weinberg s three - gluon operator .",

    "these modifications are negligible . on the other hand",
    ", low energy flavor physics gets contribution from virtual colored scalar states .",
    "the contribution proportional to the quadratic coupling @xmath66 enters in @xmath67 mixing quantities and should therefore be very small @xcite .",

    "@xcite the most important contribution to the nedm was found to arise from weinberg s cp - violating three - gluon operator operator .",
    "this contribution is generated by the cedm of the @xmath21-quark when it is integrated out to obtain the weinberg operator .",
    "this means that the @xmath21 quark edm inducing weinberg s operator gives bounds on @xmath77 .",

    "<S> we investigate new contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment induced by colored scalars . as an example , we evaluate contributions coming from the color octet , weak doublet scalar , accommodated within a modified minimal flavor violating framework . these flavor non - diagonal couplings of the color octet scalar might account for the measured assymmetry @xmath0 at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> the same couplings constrained by this assymmetry also induce two - loop contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the direct cp violating asymmetry in neutral @xmath1-meson decays is more constraining on the allowed parameter space than the current experimental bound on neutron electric dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> we comment also on contributions of higher dimensional operators to the neutron electric dipole moment within this framework . </S>"
