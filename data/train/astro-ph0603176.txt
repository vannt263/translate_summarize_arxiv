    "the question of whether and how fully convective low - mass stars and non - hydrogen burning brown dwarfs generate and dissipate magnetic fields has important implications for our understanding of their internal structure and the physical conditions in their atmospheres . theoretically , the so - called @xmath14 dynamo , which depends on shearing motions at the radiative - convective transition zone , and which is used to explain the origin of the solar magnetic field , can not operate in fully convective dwarfs . instead",
    ", the magnetic dynamo may increasingly depend on turbulent motions associated with the internal convection itself @xcite , but it is not clear if this mechanism can give rise to a large - scale , long - lived magnetic field .",
    "recent magnetohydrodynamic simulations suggest that a large - scale and stable field may in fact be generated , at least for parameters roughly appropriate for an m5 dwarf @xcite , contrary to earlier indications @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if the same result holds for the much cooler l and t dwarfs , of which a large fraction lack hydrogen burning as a source of heat .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that even if strong fields are generated , their dissipation may be hampered by the increasingly neutral atmospheres of late - m and l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then the suppression of chromospheric and coronal heating will result in decreased emission in the h@xmath6 emission line , the x - rays , and possibly the radio band , despite the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "clearly , direct observations which probe the presence , dissipation and properties of the magnetic fields are required to guide and to test these theoretical ideas .",
    "measurements based on zeeman broadening have been performed for a handful of active early - m dwarfs ( up to m4.5 ) , indicating field strengths of a few kg with near unity surface coverage @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this approach can not be used effectively for late - m , l and t dwarfs because the required atomic lines are weak in the cool atmospheres of these stars and tend to be blended with molecular features .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the field strengths can be measured through a secondary calibration of feh lines @xcite , but this approach is yet to be implemented for any star beyond m4.5 .",
    "the presence and dissipation of magnetic fields can be alternatively traced through activity indicators such as h@xmath6 , x - ray and radio emission .",
    "the h@xmath6 and x - ray emission are secondary indicators since they arise from plasma presumably heated by the dissipation of magnetic fields , through for example magnetic reconnection . in the standard scenario",
    "the input of energy drives an outflow of hot plasma into the corona through evaporation of the underlying chromosphere , leading in turn to bremsstrahlung x - ray emission and h@xmath6 emission @xcite .",
    "the radio emission , on the other hand , arises from gyroresonance or coherent processes , which trace the presence and properties of magnetic fields directly .",
    "thus , radio observations can be used to infer the field strength of individual objects directly , whereas h@xmath6 and x - ray emission provide a useful statistical measure and insight into the influence of magnetic fields on the outer layers of dwarf stars .",
    "observationally , the lack of significant change in the measured level of h@xmath6 and x - ray activity with the onset of full convection at about spectral type m3 , suggests that at least in the early - m dwarfs the putative turbulent or distributed dynamo can operate efficiently .",
    "it is also possible that the magnetic field itself acts to reduce the mass at which the transition to fully convective structure takes place @xcite .",
    "however , beyond spectral type m7 there is a precipitous drop in h@xmath6 and x - ray persistent activity , and only a few percent of the objects exhibit flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , unlike in the early - m dwarfs @xcite , many late - type rapidly rotating dwarfs exhibit little or no discernible activity in these bands @xcite .",
    "these patterns are consistent with either a decrease in the generation or dissipation of the magnetic fields , or both .",
    "on the other hand , radio emission has been detected from several late - m and l dwarfs @xcite suggesting that at least some of these objects are capable of generating and dissipating magnetic fields .",
    "surprisingly , the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity in the detected objects exceeds by several orders of magnitude the value measured for early m dwarfs and a variety of other stars ( including the sun ; @xcite ) , and there is no obvious correlation with h@xmath6 emission .",
    "thus , radio observations present a powerful , and perhaps unique approach for inferring the magnetic field strength of late - type stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "here we exploit this approach and continue our investigation of radio emission from late - m , l and t dwarfs by expanding the observed sample by about a factor of three ( to @xmath0 sources ) . with this extended sample",
    "we find continued evidence for a sharp transition in the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity at spectral type m7 , as well as an increased level of activity with later spectral type .",
    "we show , however , that as in the case of h@xmath6 and x - ray observations , the fraction of objects producing radio emission drops from about @xmath7 in the m dwarfs to only @xmath15 in the l dwarfs .",
    "most importantly , we present for the first time estimates of the magnetic field strength of a large sample of late - m and l dwarfs , and show that for the active sources there is at most a modest drop in the field strength from early - m to early - l dwarfs .",
    "we observed a sample of @xmath16 late - m , l and t dwarfs with the very large array ( vla ) at 8.46 ghz using the standard continuum mode with @xmath17 mhz contiguous bands at each frequency .",
    "the flux density scale was determined using the standard extragalactic calibrator sources 3c 48 ( j0137 + 331 ) , 3c 147 ( j0542 + 498 ) and 3c 286 ( j1331 + 305 ) , while the phase was monitored using calibrators located within @xmath18 of the targets sources . the data were reduced and analyzed using the astronomical image processing system .",
    "in addition to our observations we obtained and reduced all publicly available observations of late - m , l and t dwarfs from the vla archive , and collected all measurements published in the literature .",
    "this resulted in a total 88 objects ranging from m7 to t8 , as well a single m5 dwarf and a single m5.5 dwarf .",
    "a summary of all observations and the relevant source properties are given in table  [ tab : obs ] and figure  [ fig : prop ] .    for the detected objects we searched for variability ( flares ) using the following method .",
    "we removed all the bright field sources using the aips / imagr routine to clean the region around each source ( with the exception of the target source ) , and the aips / uvsub routine to subtract the resulting source models from the visibility data .",
    "we then plotted the real part of the complex visibilities at the position of the science target as a function of time using the aips / uvplt routine .",
    "the subtraction of field sources is necessary since their sidelobes and the change in the shape of the synthesized beam during the observation result in flux variations over the map , which may contaminate any real variability or generate false variability .",
    "quiescent radio emission has been previously detected from six late - type dwarfs ranging from spectral type m7 to l3.5 @xcite .",
    "four of these objects also produced short - lived , highly - polarized flares with a typical timescale of @xmath19 min and a flux increase compared to the quiescent level of at least a factor of few .",
    "in addition , the l3.5 dwarf 2mass j00361617 + 1821104 was shown to exhibit a periodicity of 3 hr in its quiescent radio emission , whose origin is not fully understood , but may arise from a closely - orbiting companion @xcite .    in the extended sample",
    "we detect radio emission from three additional dwarf stars : lhs 1070 ( m5.5 ) , lsr j1835 + 3259 ( m8.5 ) , and 2mass j@xmath20 ( l2.5 ) with fluxes of @xmath21 @xmath22jy , @xmath23 @xmath22jy and @xmath24 @xmath22jy , respectively .",
    "lhs 1070 has been detected on two separate occasions with fluxes of @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath22jy , respectively , consistent with non - variable quiescent emission .",
    "similarly , we do not find evidence for variability within a single observation for any of the three sources , but we note that the observations are relatively short , @xmath27 min .",
    "the fractional circular polarization for the three objects is @xmath28 ( lhs 1070 ) , @xmath29 ( lsr j1835 + 3259 ) , and @xmath30 ( 2m@xmath31 ) , similar to the level of circular polarization in the quiescent emission from previous objects .",
    "finally , we note that weak radio emission is detected in near positional coincidence ( @xmath32 ) with two other sources , 2mass j@xmath33 ( m7.5 ) and 2mass j@xmath34 ( l7.5 ) .",
    "however , we do not believe that these are genuine detections for two reasons .",
    "first , the offset for 2m@xmath35 does not coincide with the proper motion measured by @xcite ; for 2 m j@xmath36 the proper motion is not known but the offset is @xmath37 with a position angle of about @xmath38 .",
    "second , in both cases the emission is strongly detected in only one of the two intermediate frequency ( if ) channels of the vla , but is consistent with zero in the other if channel .",
    "this suggests that the radio emission is most likely spurious and may be due to a low level of interference .",
    "using the observed fluxes and fractional circular polarization we now estimate the magnetic field strengths for the detected sources .",
    "we first provide a rough estimate of the brightness temperature as a way to assess the origin of the radio emission ( coherent vs.  gyrosynchrotron ) : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 cm is jupiter s radius and roughly the source radius , and @xmath41 @xcite is the size of the emitting region if the covering fraction is of order unity . for our detected sources",
    "we find @xmath42 k. conversely , the inverse compton limit of @xmath43 k for gyrosynchrotron emission defines a minimum size for the emitting region of @xmath44 cm , or about @xmath45 of the surface area at the height of the corona .",
    "if the emitting region is in fact more compact than this size , then the emission is most likely due to coherent emission processes such as plasma radiation or electron cyclotron maser .",
    "since the latter emission mechanisms are typically responsible for short - lived flares we proceed with the reasonable assumption that the observed emission is due to gyrosynchrotron radiation .    in this context",
    "we follow the typical assumption that the emitting electrons obey a power law distribution , @xmath46 above a cutoff lorentz factor , @xmath47 .",
    "the value of the power law index is typically @xmath48 for m dwarfs , and was found to be bout 2.7 for the l3.5 dwarf 2m0036 + 18 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the standard value of @xmath49 here . the peak frequency , flux , and degree of circular polarization of the detected radio emission",
    "are directly related to the density of emitting electrons ( @xmath50 ) , the size of the emission region ( @xmath51 ) , and the magnetic field strength ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "following the formulation of @xcite we find that the peak frequency is given by @xmath53 the flux density is given by @xmath54 the fraction of circular polarization is given by @xmath55 and we assume an average angle of @xmath56 between the magnetic field and the line of sight .",
    "using @xmath57 ghz as an estimate of the spectral peak , and the measured circular polarization fractions we find that @xmath58 g for 2m@xmath31 , @xmath59 g for lhs 1070 , and @xmath60 g for lsr j1835 + 3259 . for 2m@xmath31",
    "we further find a source size @xmath61 , and @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "the former indicates that at the height of the emission region ( presumably the corona ) the field covers @xmath64 of the surface area .",
    "for the two other sources we find @xmath65 cm and @xmath66 @xmath63 ( lhs 1070 ) and @xmath67 cm and @xmath68 @xmath63 ( lsr j1835 + 3259 ) .",
    "these values , along with those inferred for the six dwarf stars detected previously , are summarized in table  [ tab : phys ] and figure  [ fig : mag ] .",
    "we note that the inferred sizes are consistent with our inference based on the brightness temperature argument that the radio emission is due to gyrosynchrotron radiation ,    for the non - detected sources we find a rough limit on the magnetic field strength by assuming typical values of the source size , @xmath69 , and electron density , @xmath70 @xmath63 , as inferred from the detected sources .",
    "the resulting upper limit on the magnetic field strength is thus @xmath71 g , which at our typical sensitivity threshold corresponds to @xmath72 g for @xmath73 pc ; for objects within 10 pc , the limit is @xmath74 g ( figure  [ fig : mag ] ) .",
    "thus , we find from both the detected and non - detected objects that the typical quiescent magnetic fields in late - m , l and t dwarfs are of the order of @xmath75 g , but may approach @xmath76 kg during flares .",
    "we note that these field strengths are relevant at the location where the radio emission is produced , possibly @xmath77 above the stellar surface .",
    "thus , depending on the exact field configuration , the surface magnetic field may be an order of magnitude larger , or nearly 1 kg even in quiescence .",
    "the inferred field strengths can be compared to those of a few early m dwarfs ( ev lac , ad leo , au mic , gl 729 ) for which values of about 4 kg with a surface coverage approaching unity have been inferred from zeeman line broadening @xcite .",
    "somewhat weaker fields , @xmath76 kg , have been estimated for young accreting brown dwarfs based on evidence for magnetic funneling from variations in the h@xmath6 line @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that the magnetic field strengths in field late - m , l and t dwarfs may be a factor of few smaller than in early - m dwarfs , and possibly with a smaller surface coverage , but these fully convective stars and brown dwarfs are clearly capable of generating large - scale , long - lived fields .",
    "with the large sample of @xmath0 m5t8 dwarfs presented in this paper and compiled from previous work , we can begin to address trends in the radio emission , and hence magnetic properties of dwarf stars .",
    "three interesting possibilities have been suggested previously based on a smaller sample of sources @xcite .",
    "first , the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity of late - m and l dwarfs appears to be orders of magnitude larger than that of other stars , including m dwarfs earlier than spectral type m7 .",
    "second , the level of radio activity appears to increase with later spectral type .",
    "finally , there may be a correlation between the strength of the radio activity and rotation velocity , such that rapid rotators exhibit stronger radio activity .",
    "we first investigate any trends in the strength of the radio activity as a function of spectral type .",
    "a proper comparison requires normalization by the bolometric luminosity of each source .",
    "these are available in the literature for about half of the survey sources , including all of the t dwarf . for the rest",
    "we use published bolometric correction factors .",
    "for the l dwarfs @xmath78 for l0l4 and @xmath79 for l5l9 , with @xmath80 for l0 @xcite . for the m dwarfs we use the mean of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with @xmath80 for m0 @xcite .    with these values , we plot the ratio of radio to bolometric luminosity , @xmath83 , as a function of spectral type in figure  [ fig : activity ] .",
    "two trends are clear from this figure .",
    "first , the fraction of detected objects drops considerably as a function of spectral type , from about @xmath7 for the m dwarfs , to about @xmath84 for the l dwarfs .",
    "if we consider only non - detections that are lower than the level of activity in the detected objects , these fractions are roughly @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "second , and perhaps more important , the level of radio activity tends to increase with later spectral types , with the active l dwarfs exhibiting a level of activity at least an order of magnitude larger than the mid - m dwarfs . whether this trend continues to late - l and t spectral types",
    "remains unclear due to the relatively small number of observed objects and the observed decrease in the fraction of active sources .",
    "still , the increased level of activity supports our inference that the magnetic field strengths are note significantly lower in late - m and l dwarfs .    on the other hand , with the larger sample we do not find clear evidence for a correlation between the level of activity and rotation velocity .",
    "specifically , for the seven detected sources with a spectral type later than m7 and a measured rotation velocity , the average value of @xmath87 is roughly the same for @xmath88 km s@xmath89 and @xmath90 km s@xmath89 .",
    "a more careful analysis of this possible trend requires rotation velocity measurements for a significantly larger sample .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab : obs ] , less than a quarter of the observed objects have measured velocities .    finally , we find continued evidence that the correlation between radio and x - ray luminosity , which is roughly constant at a value of @xmath91 for a wide range of stars @xcite , breaks down at spectral type of about m7 ( figure  [ fig : gb ] ) .",
    "possible explanations for the breakdown in this correlation have been discussed previously @xcite , and focus on efficient trapping of the relativistic electrons , thereby reducing the efficiency of coronal and chromospheric heating , or inefficient production of x - rays due to a reduction in the number of free ions in the cool atmospheres of these dwarf stars . from a purely observational standpoint ,",
    "the data indicate that the decrease in x - ray luminosity by three orders of magnitude occurs over a narrow range in spectral type at about m7 ( or @xmath92 k ) , roughly the same spectral type where a transition to predominantly neutral atmospheres occurs @xcite .",
    "this is also the same location at which a significant drop in h@xmath6 activity occurs , from an average value of @xmath93 earlier than m5 to @xmath94 later than m7 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the magnetic field strengths and radio activity do not decrease significantly indicates that the drop in x - ray and h@xmath6 activity is related instead to the structure of the atmosphere , chromosphere and corona .",
    "we presented radio observations of 88 dwarf stars and brown dwarfs in the range m7t8 , along with a single m5 and a single m5.5 dwarf .",
    "this sample is nearly comparable to the number of objects with h@xmath6 measurements , but is significantly larger than the number of objects observed in the x - rays .",
    "the drop in the fraction of active sources at the m / l transition , which is observed in h@xmath6 , is also apparent in the radio observations .",
    "however , the strength of the activity in the detected objects is in fact higher for the l dwarfs , both in quiescence and during flares . as we have shown in  [ sec : phys ] , this is probably because the magnetic field strengths remain roughly unchanged despite the drop in effective temperature and luminosity with later spectral type .",
    "the implication is that the magnetic dynamo process may be similar in early - m and l dwarfs , and is not strongly dependent on luminosity or temperature .",
    "we also stress that while h@xmath6 observations are relatively simple to carry out , it is not trivial to translate the observed emission to an estimate of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the advantage of radio observations is that they directly trace the strength of the field , and provide in addition information on the physical properties of the emission region , such as its size and density .",
    "we therefore suggest that a three - pronged approach is required for continued progress in our understanding of magnetic fields in dwarf stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "first , the survey for radio emission from these objects should be expanded to all of the @xmath95 currently known l and t dwarfs , as well as a large sample of objects in the spectral range m5m9 , which covers the breakdown in the radio / x - ray correlation .",
    "such a survey can be carried out efficiently with the evla , which is scheduled to come on - line in the next few years and which will deliver a nearly order of magnitude increase in sensitivity .",
    "this is essential since the majority of the current detections are near the threshold of the vla .",
    "we estimate that about @xmath96 hr of observing time would be required for such an undertaking , delivering a sensitivity of @xmath97 at l0 and @xmath98 at t0 .",
    "second , the objects that have been detected so far , and will be detected with the expanded survey , should be observed over a wide frequency range to better characterize the shape of their spectrum and the frequency dependence of their polarization .",
    "this is essential for deriving magnetic field strengths to better accuracy than is possible with the current single - frequency observations .",
    "we expect that at the current signal - to - noise level , the magnetic field strengths can be inferred to an accuracy of @xmath99 , which is comparable to , or better than , measurements made from zeeman broadening for early - m dwarfs .",
    "in addition , long timescale , high signal - to - noise observations can be used to check for possible periodicity in the radio emission , as has been uncovered for the l3.5 dwarf 2m0036 + 18 @xcite .",
    "if the periodicity is in fact related to a close - in companion , which excites the dynamo by tidal or magnetic interactions , this may be a ubiquitous feature of the active objects .    finally , these same objects should be observed simultaneously in the radio , x - rays , and h@xmath6 in order to directly measure the correlation , or lack thereof , between these activity indicators .",
    "this is necessary in order to trace the origin of the shift in the radio / x - ray correlation , and in order to trace the evolution of flares as the release of magnetic stresses , evident in the radio , heats up the corona ( x - rays ) and chromosphere ( h@xmath6 ) . while the current observations allow us to address in a statistical manner the overall trends observed with each technique , only simultaneous observations can provide insight into the production and evolution of flares . as the most catastrophic events in the atmospheres of dwarf stars , such events will undoubtedly shed light on the structure of the fields , their strengths , and the details of the energy dissipation process , all of which will provide observational constraints on the dynamo mechanism in dwarf stars .    research has benefitted from the m , l , and t dwarf compendium housed at dwarfarchives.org and maintained by chris gelino , davy kirkpatrick , and adam burgasser . this work has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",

    "<S> we present radio observations of a comprehensive sample of @xmath0 dwarf stars and brown dwarfs ranging from spectral type m5 to t8 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect three radio active sources in addition to the six objects previously detected in quiescence and outburst , leading to an overall detection rate of about @xmath1 for objects later than m7 . from the properties of the radio emission we infer magnetic field strengths of @xmath2 g in quiescence and nearly 1 kg during flares , while the majority of the non - detected objects have @xmath3 g. depending on the configuration and size of the magnetic loops , the surface magnetic fields may approach 1 kg even in quiescence , at most a factor of few smaller than in early - m dwarfs . with the larger sample of sources we find continued evidence for ( i ) a sharp transition around spectral type m7 from a ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity of @xmath4 to @xmath5 , ( ii ) increased radio activity with later spectral type , in contrast to h@xmath6 and x - ray observations , and ( iii ) an overall drop in the fraction of active sources from about @xmath7 for m dwarfs to about @xmath8 for l dwarfs , fully consistent with h@xmath6 and x - ray observations . taken together , these trends suggest that some late - m and l dwarfs are capable of generating @xmath9 kg magnetic fields , but the overall drop in the fraction of such objects is likely accompanied by a change in the structure of the chromospheres and coronae , possibly due to the increasingly neutral atmospheres and/or a transition to a turbulent dynamo . </S>",
    "<S> these possibilities can be best addressed through simultaneous radio , x - ray and h@xmath6 observations , which can trace the effect of magnetic fields on the coronae and chromospheres in a direct , rather than a statistical , manner . </S>",
    "<S> still , a more extended radio survey currently holds the best promise for measuring the magnetic field properties of a large number of dwarf stars .    </S>",
