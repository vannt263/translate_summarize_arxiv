    "a real option is the right , but not the obligation , to undertake certain business initiatives , such as deferring , abandoning , expanding , staging or contracting a capital investment project .",
    "real options have three characteristics : the decision may be postponed ; there is uncertainty about future rewards ; the investment cost is irreversible .",
    "there are several types of real options and different kinds of questions , but in all of them there is the issue regarding the optimal timing to undertake the decision ( for instance , investment , abandon or switching ) .",
    "consult @xcite for a survey on real options analysis .    in this paper",
    "we propose a two - fold contribution to the state of the art of real options analysis .",
    "on one hand we assume that the uncertainty involving the decision depends on two stochastic processes : the demand and the investment cost . on the other hand",
    "we allow the dynamics of these processes to be a combination of a diffusion part ( with continuous sample path ) with a jump part ( introducing discontinuities in the sample paths ) .",
    "so , the model presented here expands the usual setting of options and adds new features , including the ability to model jumps in the demand process , and including stochastic investment costs .    in the early works in finance , regarding both finance options and investment decisions , the underlying stochastic process modeling the uncertainty",
    "was frequently assumed to be a continuous process , as a geometric brownian motion ( gbm , for short ) .",
    "there are many reasons for this , but this is largely due to the fact that the normal distribution , as well as the continuous - time process it generates have nice analytic properties @xcite .",
    "observations from real situations show that this assumption does not hold .",
    "the bar chart in figure [ fig : apple ] shows the global sales numbers of iphones from the @xmath0 quarter of 2007 to the end of 2014 , with data aggregated by quarters ( source : statista 2014 ) .",
    "quarter 2007 to @xmath1 quarter 2014 ( in million units ) ]    it is clear that in this case upward jumps occur with a certain frequency , that may be related with the launching of new versions of the iphone .    nowadays , with the world global market , there are exogenous events that may lead to a sudden increase or decrease in the demand for a certain product .",
    "clearly , these shocks will considerably affect the decisions of the investors .",
    "also the investment costs depend highly on other factors , such as the oil , raw materials or labour prices .",
    "therefore , when we assume the investment to be constant and known , we are simplifying the model .",
    "this problem is even more important when one considers large investments that take several years to be completed ( e.g. construction of dams , nuclear power plants , or high speed railways ) .",
    "the example regarding the number of sales of iphones shows the existence of jumps in the demand process .",
    "in fact , empirical analysis shows there is a need to contemplate models that can take into account discontinuous behavior for a quite wide range of situations .",
    "for example , regarding investment decisions , in particular in the case of high - technology companies - where the fast advances in technology continue to challenge managerial decision - makers in terms of the timing of investments @xcite - there is a strong need to consider models that take into account sudden decreases or increases in the demand level @xcite .",
    "morever , examples regarding jumps in the investment are also easy to find .",
    "the jumps may represent uncertainties about the arrival and impact ( on the underlying investment ) of new information concerning technological innovation , competition , political risk , regulatory effects and other sources @xcite .",
    "it is particularly important to consider jumps process in investment problems related with r&d investments , as @xcite suggest .",
    "furthermore , when one is deciding about investments in energy , which are long - term investments , one should accommodate the impact of climate change policies effect on carbon prices , as @xcite points out in their report .",
    "for instance , the horizon 2020 energy challenge is designed to support the transition to a secure , clean and efficient energy system for europe .",
    "so , if a company decides to undertake any kind of such investment during this time period , probably will apply to special funds and thus the investment cost will likely be smaller .",
    "after 2020 , there are not yet rules about the european funding of such projects .",
    "therefore , not only the investment cost is random , but also will suffer a jump due to this new regulatory regime ( see http://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/energy for more details ) .    following this reasoning , in this paper we assume that the decision regarding the investment depends on two stochastic factors : one related with the demand process , that we will denote by @xmath2 , and another one related with the investment cost , @xmath3 .",
    "we allow that both processes may have discontinuous paths , due to the possibility of jumps driven by external poisson processes .",
    "later we will introduce in more detail the mathematical model and assumptions .",
    "we also claim that we extend the approach provided in @xcite , in chapter 6.5 . in this book",
    ", the authors consider that there are two sources of uncertainty ( the revenue flow and the investment cost ) , both following a gbm , with ( possible ) correlated brownian motions .",
    "then the authors propose a change of variable that will turn this problem with two variables into a problem with one variable , analytically solvable . here",
    "we follow the same approach , but with two different features : first the dynamics of the processes involved are no longer a gbm and , secondly , we prove analytically that the solution we get is in fact exactly the solution of the original problem with two dimensions . in order to prove this result we derive explicitly the quasi - variational inequalities emerging from the principle of dynamic programming , obtaining the corresponding hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation",
    "moreover , using a verification theorem , we prove that the proposed solution is indeed the solution of the original problem @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the framework rationale and the valuation model , and in section 3 we formalize the problem as an optimal stopping one , we present our approach and provide the optimal solution . in section 4 we derive results regarding the behavior of the investment threshold as a function of the most relevant parameters and , finally , section 5 concludes the work , presenting also some recommendations for future extensions .",
    "in this section we introduce the mathematical model along with the assumptions that we use in order to derive the investment policy . for that , we start by presenting the dynamics of the stochastic processes involved , namely , the demand and the investment expenditures processes .",
    "we also introduce the valuation model we use to derive the optimal investment problem that we address in this paper .",
    "we assume that there are two sources of uncertainty , that we will denote by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , representing the demand and the investment , respectively . moreover , we consider that both have continuous sample paths almost everywhere but occasionally jumps may occur , causing a discontinuity in the path",
    ".    generally speaking , let @xmath6 denote a jump - diffusion process , which has two types of changes : the `` normal '' vibration , which is represented by a gbm , with continuous sample paths , and the `` abnormal '' , modeled by a jump process , which introduce discontinuities .",
    "the jumps occur in random times and are driven by an homogeneous poisson process , hereby denoted by @xmath7 , with rate @xmath8 . moreover , the percentages of the jumps are themselves random variables , that we denote by @xmath9 , i.e. , although they may be of different magnitude , they all obey the same probability law and are independent from each others .",
    "we let @xmath10 , allowing for positive and for negative jumps .",
    "thus we may express @xmath11 as follows : @xmath12 } } \\prod_{i=1}^{n_t}{\\left(1+u_i\\right)},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the initial value of the process , i.e. , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent , respectively , the drift and the volatility of the continuous part of the process and @xmath17 is a brownian motion process .",
    "furthermore , the processes @xmath17 and @xmath7 are independent and are also both independent of the sequence of random variables @xmath18 .",
    "we use the convention that if @xmath19 for some @xmath20 , then the product in equation is equal to 1 . note that considering the parameters associated with the jumps equal to zero , we obtain the usual gbm .    as both the brownian motion and the poisson processes",
    "are markovian , it follows that @xmath21 is also markovian .",
    "it is also stationary and its @xmath22 order moments are provided in the next lemma ( see appendix ( [ moments ] ) for the proof ) .",

    "finally , we assume that the both processes are independent from each other .",
    "next we introduce the valuation model , that defines the production function for the problem that we propose to address .      in this paper",
    "we propose to solve the question of when to invest in a new project , when both the demand and the investment are stochastic and subject to shocks .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the investment may take some time to really starts to pay back , and therefore there may be a gap of @xmath32 time units between the decision and the effectiveness of the investment .",
    "we also assume that the profit of the firm depends on the stochastic process of the demand , and we use the following notation : @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the profit of the firm before ( after ) the investment .",
    "we consider an isoelastic function : @xmath35 for @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "the goal of the firm is to find the optimal time to invest in this new project , i.e. , for every @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we want to find @xmath71 and @xmath72 such that : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the set of all stopping times adapted to the filtration generated by the bidimensional stochastic process @xmath75 .",

    "whenever the meaning is clear from the context , we will simplify the notation and will use just @xmath85 instead .",
    "the hjb equation represents the two possible decisions that the firm has .",
    "the first term of the equation corresponds to the decision to continue with the actual project and therefore postpone the investment decision .",
    "the second term corresponds to the decision to invest and hence the end of the decision problem .",
    "thus @xmath86 is the set of values of demand and investment cost such it is optimal to continue with the actual project and , for that reason , is usually known as _ continuation region _ , whereas in the _ stopping region _ , @xmath87",
    ", the value of the firm is exactly the gain if one decides to exercise the option .",
    "the sets @xmath88 and @xmath87 are complementary on @xmath89 .",
    "we define @xmath90 which is the first time the state variables corresponding to the demand and the investment cost are outside the continuation region .",
    "note that means that @xmath91 moreover , @xmath92 whereas @xmath93 the solution of the hjb equation , @xmath76 , must satisfy the following initial condition , @xmath94 which reflects the fact that the value of the firm will be zero if the demand is also zero .",
    "furthermore , the following value - matching and smooth - pasting conditions should also hold @xmath95 for @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes the boundary of @xmath98 , which we call _ critical boundary _ , and @xmath99 is the gradient function . in this particular case , with two sources of uncertainty ,",
    "the critical boundary is a threshold curve separating the two regions .",
    "so in order to solve the investment problem , we need to find the solution to the following partial differential equation : @xmath100 in the continuation region and , simultaneously , to identify the continuation @xmath88 and stopping @xmath87 regions .",
    "both questions are challenging : on one hand the solution to can not be found explicitly , and on the other hand we need to guess the form of the continuation region and prove that the solution proposed for the hjb equation satisfies the verification theorem .",
    "hereafter , we propose an alternative way to solve this problem , that circumvent the difficulties posed by the fact that we have two sources of uncertainty .      in this section",
    "we start by guessing the shape of the continuation region and latter we will prove indeed that our guess is the correct one , using the verification theorem .",
    "our guess about the continuation region comes from intuitive arguments : high demand and low investment cost should encourage the firm to invest , whereas in case of low demand and high investment cost it should be optimal to continue , i.e. , postpone the investment decision . see figure [ fig : initialspace ] for the general plot of both regions .",
