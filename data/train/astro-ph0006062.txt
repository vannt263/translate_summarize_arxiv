    "in the standard picture for the formation of cosmic structures via gravitational instability the peculiar velocity of a galaxy is generated by fluctuations in the mass distribution . for galaxies outside virialized systems , linear perturbation theory predicts @xmath10 where @xmath2 is the mass density parameter , @xmath11 is the hubble constant and @xmath12 is the mass density fluctuation field . if the relationship between the galaxy distribution , @xmath13 , and @xmath12 is approximately linear , @xmath14 , then the parameter @xmath1 can be derived from the comparison between the observed peculiar velocity field and that predicted from the galaxy distribution .",
    "a particularly useful method for performing a velocity - velocity comparison is the modal expansion method developed by nusser & davis ( 1995 , hereafter nd95 ) .",
    "this method expands the velocity fields by means of smooth functions defined in redshift space , thus alleviating the malmquist biases inherent in real space analysis .",
    "furthermore , the modal expansion filters the observed and predicted velocities in the same way , so that the smoothed fields can be compared directly . because the number of modes is substantially smaller than the number of data points , the method also provides the means of estimating @xmath15 from a likelihood analysis carried out on a mode - by - mode basis , instead of galaxy - by - galaxy .",
    "the similar smoothing and the mode - by - mode comparison substantially simplify the error analysis .",
    "the modal expansion method has previously been used in comparisons between the 1.2 jy predicted velocities and observed velocities inferred from tully - fisher ( tf ) measurements ( davis , nusser & willick 1996 , hereafter dnw , da costa et .",
    "al . 1998 ) . in this paper",
    ", we perform a similar analysis using the recently completed redshift - distance survey of early - type galaxies ( hereafter enear , da costa 2000 ) and the redshift survey ( saunders et .",
    "al . 2000 ) .",
    "because of differences in the nature of the data sets considered some slight changes in the method are required and are described below .",
    "our goal is to investigate how well the velocity field mapped by early - type galaxies matches the velocity field inferred from the survey , and to obtain the parameter @xmath15 yielding the best match .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the enear redshift - distance catalog . in section 3",
    ", we describe the modal expansion method as used here , present maps of the enear and radial peculiar velocity field and perform a likelihood analysis to derive @xmath15 .",
    "a brief summary of our conclusions is presented in section 5 .",
    "we use a sub - sample extracted from the all - sky enear redshift - distance survey ( da costa 2000 ) comprising 578 objects within @xmath16  , 355 field galaxies and 223 groups / clusters .",
    "galaxies have been objectively assigned to groups and clusters using redshifts taken from complete redshift surveys sampling the same volume .",
    "individual galaxy distances were estimated from an inverse template relation derived by combining cluster data ( bernardi 2000 ) .",
    "the cluster sample consists of 569 galaxies in 28 clusters . over 80% of the galaxies in the magnitude - limited sample and roughly 60% of the cluster galaxies",
    "have new spectroscopic and photometric data obtained by the enear survey .",
    "multiple observations using different telescope / instrument configurations ensure the homogeneity of the data .",
    "furthermore , the sample completeness is uniform across the sky .",
    "an unbiased estimate of @xmath17 can be obtained from the comparison between smooth velocity fields with similar spatial resolution , derived from the enear and data . to generate smooth fields we expand the peculiar velocities of both data in terms of smooth base functions .",
    "the expansion carried out here shares the general properties of that used by nd95 , but differs in details . in their application to tf catalogs , nd95 defined @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the galaxy redshift in and @xmath20 its radial peculiar velocity .",
    "the function @xmath21 was then expressed by an expansion involving smooth functions .",
    "the final estimate of the smoothed velocity field was that obtained by minimizing the scatter of the rotational speeds given the magnitudes in the inverse tf relation .",
    "the scatter was also simultaneously minimized with respect to the the parameter of the tf relation .",
    "this led to an unbiased calibration of the inverse tf relation because the sample was mainly magnitude selected . the galaxy angular size and velocity dispersion in the @xmath0 relation",
    "do not uniquely fix the magnitude according to which the enear sample is selected .",
    "so simultaneous minimization might lead to a biased estimate of the parameters of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "although the bias is mild we use the calibration of the _ inverse _ @xmath0 given by bernardi  ( 2000 ) by a regression of @xmath22 on @xmath23 in clusters .",
    "we also express the peculiar velocity , @xmath24 , rather than the function @xmath21 in terms of smooth functions .",
    "another difference is that nd95 used tf catalogs with all galaxies having the same relative distance error which allowed an additional simplification in the application of the modal expansion method , namely , the expansion in terms of orthogonal smooth functions .",
    "this made the tf velocity error covariance matrices diagonal . in the enear sample ,",
    "the relative distance error is not the same for all objects ( galaxies and groups / clusters ) , so using orthogonal functions does not offer any further simplification since the enear error matrix remains non - diagonal .",
    "the lack of orthogonality slightly complicates the error analysis but does not affect the efficiency of the expansion . choosing the spherical harmonics and bessel functions to be our base smooth functions we write the radial peculiar velocity model as @xmath25 y_{lm}\\left(\\theta,\\phi\\right ) \\quad .",
    "\\label{pexp}\\ ] ] where the sum is over @xmath26 to @xmath27 , @xmath28 to @xmath29 , and @xmath30 to @xmath31 . for the reasons given in dnw",
    ", we formulate our model to describe the velocity field with respect to the motion of the local group .",
    "the constant @xmath32 is non - zero only for the dipole term ensuring that @xmath33 at the origin .",
    "the function @xmath34 in the argument of the bessel functions makes their oscillations match the radial distribution of the enear data .",
    "here we take @xmath35 $ ] , but other similar forms can be used as well .",
    "also the expansion does not include a hubble - like flow ( @xmath36 ) so we assume that any such flow has been consistently removed from the enear and velocities .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 are found by minimizing @xmath38 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are the raw observed velocities and @xmath40 is the error of the velocity estimate resulting from observational uncertainties and intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0 . for field galaxies",
    "@xmath41 and for groups of galaxies it is reduced by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of galaxies in the group .",
    "we apply the modal expansion method to smooth the raw measured velocities of the @xmath44 enear objects within a redshift of 6000  ( bernardi et .",
    "al . 2000 ) .",
    "we use 51 modes corresponding to @xmath45 in ( [ pexp ] ) .",
    "the smoothing scale of these functions is linear with redshift and matches the low resolution filter used in ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "the smoothed velocities were then derived by minimizing ( 3 ) with respect to @xmath46 assuming an error of @xmath47 in the raw velocities of the enear objects .",
    "the reduced @xmath48 per d.o.f of the fit was 1.017 , a satisfactory value in this type of analysis ( see dnw , da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) .    given an assumed value for @xmath15 we interpolate the predicted velocity field , computed by branchini et .",
    "al . ( 2000 ) , to the positions of the enear galaxies .",
    "branchini et .",
    "al . obtained the velocities from the galaxy distribution with a top - hat window of width equal to half the mean particle separation at a given redshift .",
    "the fields are then expanded in the same orthogonal set of basis functions as employed for the enear velocities . the and enear velocities are guaranteed to have the same resolution because the original smoothing of the density field is small compared to the resolution of the modal expansion .",
    "the smoothed enear velocities are shown in figure  [ fig : filt ] , in redshift shells 2000thick .",
    "comparison of this figure and figure  3 of shows that the general flow pattern is remarkably similar . in the case of enear , in the innermost shell",
    "very few prominent structures are probed by bright ellipticals . however , in the next two shells a strong dipole pattern can be easily recognized , being of comparable amplitude to that of observed with the sfi galaxies .",
    "this dipole corresponds to the reflex motion of the local group , with infalling galaxies in the hydra - centaurus direction and an outflow towards the perseus - pisces complex .",
    "the quality of the match can be evaluated from figure  [ fig : rez05 ] which shows the residual velocity field obtained subtracting the smoothed field from that of the enear , assuming @xmath49 . as can be seen",
    "the overall agreement is good with only a few more distant galaxies giving large residuals .",
    "note , however , that even though with a larger amplitude , the mismatch seen in the outermost redshift shell at @xmath50 , @xmath51 between enear and correspond to mismatches in the comparison between sfi and 1.2 jy velocity fields .",
    "this may correspond to a real mismatch between measured and predicted velocities which deserves further investigation .",
    "the filtered enear and velocity fields are fully described by the modal expansion coefficients , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , of the enear and fields , respectively . since the number of these coefficients is significantly smaller than the number of galaxies , it is more efficient to estimate @xmath15 by comparing the modes rather than the individual galaxy velocities . as in",
    "we define our best estimate for @xmath15 as the value that corresponds to the minimum of the pseudo-@xmath48 @xmath54 \\left[{\\rm \\bf t}+ { \\rm \\bf m}(\\beta)\\right]^{-1 } \\left[\\alpha^ { j^\\prime}_{en}-\\alpha^{j^\\prime}_{ps}(\\beta)\\right ] , \\label{chia}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the the error covariance matrices of the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . for brevity of notation",
    "we have replaced the triplet @xmath59 with one index @xmath60 .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath61 incorporates errors due to ( i ) the uncertainty in the lg motion , which creates a dipole discrepancy between the enear and the velocities , @xmath62 the discreteness in distribution of galaxies which propagates into the velocity field . and",
    "@xmath63 small scale coherent ( as in triple valued zones ) nonlinear velocities that are not included in the recovered velocities .",
    "details of how these error contributions are computed are in .",
    "since the expansion functions are not orthogonal the enear covariance matrix @xmath64 has nonzero off - diagonal elements .",
    "this matrix is simply the inverse of @xmath65 where the derivatives are computed at the minimum of @xmath48 given by ( [ minchi ] ) .",
    "given the covariance matrices , we compute the curve of the reduced @xmath66 as a function of @xmath15 , which is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : dv ] . the curve was computed with an error of 150  in the estimation of the lg motion and 160  for the amplitude of nonlinear error in the field ( see da costa et .",
    "al . 1998 ) .",
    "this amplitude of the nonlinear error was chosen to make the @xmath67 per d.o.f equal to unity at the minimum . in their analysis of the sfi and 1.2 jy , obtained a lower value of 90  for the amplitude of this error .",
    "the difference can be attributed , as expected , to a better match between the sfi and velocities and the increased nonlinearities in the velocity at the positions of the enear galaxies which preferentially reside in high density regions .",
    "the minimum value of the @xmath68 is attained at @xmath49 , with the 1-sigma error being less than @xmath69 .",
    "we note that this result is not sensitive to the exact values adopted for the error estimates another statistic indicating the goodness of the match between the fields for various @xmath15 is the correlation function of the residual @xmath70 between the smoothed enear and radial velocities .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : dv ] for @xmath71 , 0.5 , and 0.9 .",
    "the amplitude of the field is small for @xmath71 , so the correlation function for this @xmath15 is close to the correlation function of @xmath72 alone , while the opposite is true for @xmath73 . on the other hand , for @xmath49",
    "the correlation of the residual velocity field is significantly smaller , indicating a good match between the measured and predicted velocity fields .",
    "using the modal expansion method of nd95 and the recently completed enear redshift - distance survey and the redshift survey we have carried out a comparison between the observed peculiar velocity field and that predicted from the distribution of galaxies .",
    "we find that the corresponding smoothed fields agree well and the best match is obtained with @xmath74 . this value is intermediate to those derived using the mark  iii and sfi catalogs both based primarily on spiral galaxies .",
    "it is also consistent with the results obtained by borgani ( 2000 ) using an independent method based on modeling the velocity correlation function .",
    "note , however , that the discrepancy between the values determined from these methods and those obtained from the power spectrum analysis ( zaroubi 2000 ) and density - density comparisons ( sigad 1998 ) still persist .",
    "the good agreement between sfi and 1.2 jy and between enear and implies that the sfi and enear velocity fields are also in good agreement .",
    "this suggests that the velocity maps obtained from the new distance - redshift surveys are a fair representation of the underlying velocity field , as the general characteristics of the observed flow fields are independent of the type of galaxies and distance indicators used . the good agreement among the values of @xmath15 obtained using mark  iii , sfi , enear",
    ", 1.2 jy and catalogs gives further support to low values of @xmath15 and point toward low - density cosmologies .",
