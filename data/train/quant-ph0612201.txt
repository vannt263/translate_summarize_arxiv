    "berry observed that quantum systems may retain a memory of their motion in hilbert space through the acquisition of geometric phases  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , these phase factors depend only on the geometry of the path traversed by the system during its evolution .",
    "soon after this discovery , geometric phases became a subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite . in recent years , renewed interest has arisen in the study of geometric phases in connection with quantum information processing  @xcite . indeed , geometric , or holonomic quantum computation ( qc ) may be useful in achieving fault tolerance , since the geometric character of the phase provides protection against certain classes of errors  solinas:04,zhu:05,fuentes - guridi:05,wuzanardilidar:05 .",
    "however , a comprehensive investigation in this direction requires a generalization of the concept of geometric phases to the domain of _ open _ quantum systems , i.e. , quantum systems which may decohere due to their interaction with an external environment .",

    "geometric phases in open systems , and more recently their applications in holonomic qc , have been considered in a number of works , since the late 1980 s .",
    "the first , phenomenological approach to the subject used the schrdinger equation with non - hermitian hamiltonians  garrison:88,dattoli:90 . while a consistent non - hermitian hamiltonian description of an open system in general requires the theory of stochastic schrdinger equations @xcite , this phenomenological approach for the first time indicated that complex abelian geometric phases should appear for systems undergoing cyclic evolution . in refs .",
    "ellinas:89,gamliel:89,romero:02,whitney:03,whitney:05,kamleitner:04 , geometric phases acquired by the density operator were analyzed for various explicit models within a master equation approach . in refs .",
    "carollo:03,fuentes - guridi:05 , the quantum jumps method was employed to provide a definition of geometric phases in markovian open systems ( related difficulties with stochastic unravellings have been pointed out in ref .",
    "bassi:05 ) . in another approach the density operator , expressed in its eigenbasis , was lifted to a purified state @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a formalism in terms of mean values of distributions was presented .",
    "an interferometric approach for evaluating geometric phases for mixed states evolving unitarily was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended to non - unitary evolution in refs .",
    "this interferometric approach can also be considered from a purification point of view  @xcite .",
    "this multitude of different proposals revealed various interesting facets of the problem .",
    "nevertheless , the concept of adiabatic geometric phases in open systems remained unresolved in general , since most of these treatments did not employ an adiabatic approximation genuinely developed for open systems .",
    "note that the applicability of the closed systems adiabatic approximation  messiah : vol2 to open systems problems is not a priori clear and should be justified on a case - by - case basis .",
    "moreover , almost all of the previous works on open systems geometric phases were concerned with the abelian ( berry phase ) case .",
    "exceptions are the very recent refs .",
    "fuentes - guridi:05,florio:06,trullo:06 , which discuss both non - adiabatic and adiabatic dynamics , but employ the standard adiabatic theorem for closed systems in the latter case .",
    "recently , a fully self - consistent approach for both abelian and non - abelian adiabatic geometric phases in open systems was proposed by sarandy and lidar ( sl ) in ref .",
    "it applies to the very general class of systems described by convolutionless master equations @xcite .",
    "sl made use of the formalism they developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for adiabaticity in open systems , which relies on the jordan normal form of the relevant liouville ( or lindblad ) super - operator .",
    "the geometric phase was then defined in terms of the left and right eigenvectors of this super - operator .",
    "this definition is a natural generalization of the one given by berry for a closed system , and was shown to have a proper closed system limit .",
    "the formalism was illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a spin system interacting with an adiabatically varying magnetic field .    in order to address the basic question posed above ,",
    "we study here the adiabatic geometric phase in a multi - level atomic system using the sl formalism .",
    "specifically , we consider the process of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite in a three - level atomic system in a @xmath0 configuration .",
    "we analyze a version of stirap where the closed system geometric phase is identically zero .",
    "we then show that when spontaneous emission and/or collisional relaxation are included , the same stirap process yields a non - vanishing geometric phase .",
    "this decoherence - induced geometric phase is an example of `` beneficial decoherence '' , where the environment performs a potentially useful task .",
    "this is conceptually similar to the phenomenon of decoherence - induced entanglement @xcite .",
    "since the sl formalism involves finding the jordan normal form of a general matrix , which is an analytically difficult problem , we developed a numerically stable program to find the jordan form of any complex square matrix and used it to find the geometric phase @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",

    "it is clear that the adiabaticity condition is satisfied only for @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "when we repeat our calculations of the open system geometric phase with @xmath10 varying between angles @xmath185 and @xmath186 corresponding to the times @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( i.e. , not along a complete cycle in the @xmath189 parameter space ) , we find  as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ]  that the effect on the geometric phase is entirely negligible .",
    "this confirms that our choice of parameters satisfies the adiabatic limit for all practical purposes .",
    "our study of stirap in an open three level quantum system reveals that the interaction with the environment can endow a system with a geometric phase , where none existed without the interaction with the environment .",
    "mathematically , the vanishing geometric phase in the closed system case is attributable to the vanishing integrand in the berry formula . in a certain sense",
    "this is easily understood as the result of having a geometric phase determined by only a single parameter ( @xmath10 ) , whence no solid angle is traced out in parameter space .",
    "it would then be natural to conclude that , by including the interaction with the environment a non - zero solid angle is created , implying that in the presence of decoherence motion along an orthogonal direction in parameter space must have taken place .",
    "however , one must be careful in accepting this explanation , since in fact the polar angles @xmath10 and @xmath47 do not properly describe the parameter space in our problem :  indeed , @xmath10 varies from @xmath15 to @xmath39 ( while @xmath47 is constant ) and thus does not describe a closed path , while the correct parameter space is that defined by the pulse amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath20 ( see fig .",

    "thus a proper explanation of the intriguing effect of an environmentally induced geometric phase is still lacking and will be undertaken in a future publication .",
    "here we conjecture that this is due to the non - commutativity of the driving hamiltonian and the decohering processes we have considered",
    ". it should be possible to test this by using the quantum trajectories approach to the open systems geometric phase fuentes - guridi:05 .",
    "another interesting open question is to what extent the finding presented here can be made useful in the context of holonomic quantum computing @xcite , i.e. , whether can one constructively exploit the environmentally induced geometric phase for the generation of quantum logic gates ."
