    "accurate abundance determinations through optical spectroscopy are impossible for heavily obscured evolved stellar populations such as the dusty spheroids or bulge - embedded globular clusters ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the visible may not be representative of the older stellar populations in the galaxies .",
    "there are promising nir counterparts of some important visible diagnostics : i.e. in stars , the optical age indicator h@xmath2 correlates well with br@xmath3 while the metallicity indicators mgb and mg2 correlate with mgi1.50@xmath0 m and co1.62@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "we use a sample of elliptical and bulge - dominate galaxies that have reliable lick - indices from @xcite to test if these correlations remains valid in galaxies and to calibrate the ir mg features as abundance indicators .",
    "we created a nir population synthesis model based on single age , single metallicity stellar populations ( ssps ) that describes the parameters of the entire population with a single isochrone .",
    "the stellar evolution models are from @xcite and the imf is from @xcite . the hk ir stellar library of @xcite was used . in general , our model predicts weaker nir features than the observed ones in elliptical galaxies , probably due to the higher @xmath1-to - iron ratio in the ellipticals , with respect to the solar neighborhood from where most of our library stars come from .",
    "we presented here our nir ( 1.5 - 2.5@xmath0 m ) synthetic spectra , and we examine how they are affected by changes in age and imf ( fig.[agevar ] ) .",
    "the model predicts that the ir features are only weakly imf and age dependent .",
    "we found no significant trend between the optical mg2 and the nir features in galaxies ( fig.[indexcorr ] ) .",
    "the ir co - to - atomic features ratio vs. the @xmath1-elements enrichment in optical for 4 observed galaxies is consistent with a constant .",
    "provisionally , we can conclude that the cai and nai features trace the @xmath1 enhancement , same as the co.    bender , r. , burstein , d. and faber , s. m. , 1993 , , 411 , 153 ivanov , v. d. and luhman k. l. , 2004 , , 151 , 387 kroupa , p. , tout , c. a. and gilmore , g. , 1993 , 262,5 45 pietrinferni a. , cassisi s. , salaris m. and castelli f. , 2004 , , 612 , 168 stephens & frogel , a. w. and frogel , j. a.,2004 , , 127 , 925"
