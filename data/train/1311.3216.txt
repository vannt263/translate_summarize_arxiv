    "neutron stars ( nss ) are natural testing grounds of grand unification theories of fundamental forces as their compositions are determined mainly by the weak and electromagnetic forces through the @xmath4 equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions while their mechanical stability is maintained by the balance between the strong and gravitational forces",
    ". moreover , neutron stars are among the densest objects with the strongest gravity in the universe , making them ideal places to test simultaneously our understanding about the nature of super - dense nuclear matter and the strong - field predictions of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "many fundamental questions about both the strong - field gravity and properties of super - dense nuclear matter remain to be answered @xcite . tied to the fundamental strong equivalence principle @xcite",
    ", the degeneracy between the ns matter content and its gravity requires a simultaneous understanding about both the strong - field gravity and the equation of state ( eos ) of super - dense nuclear matter .",
    "for example , the masses and radii of neutron stars are determined by the balance between the strong - field behavior of gravity and the eos of dense nuclear matter .",
    "while the nature of super - dense matter in nss and its eos are currently largely unknown , there is also no fundamental reason to choose einstein s gr over other alternatives and it is known that the gr theory itself may break down at the strong - field limit @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is very interesting to note that alternative gravity theories , which have all passed low - field tests but diverge from gr in the strong - field regime , predict neutron stars with significantly different properties than their gr counterparts @xcite .",
    "in fact , the variations in the predicted ns mass - radius correlation from modifying gravity are larger than those from varying the eos of super - dense matter in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the eos of super - dense matter and the strong - field gravity have to be studied simultaneously to understand properties of neutron stars accurately .",
    "moreover , the gravity - eos degeneracy can only be broken by using at least two independent observables .",
    "we notice that effects of modified gravity on properties of neutron stars have been under intense investigation .",
    "the conclusions are , however , strongly model - dependent , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", it is interesting to mention that the very recent test of strong - field gravity using the binding energy of the most massive ns observed so far , the psr j0348 + 0432 of mass @xmath5 , found no evidence of any deviation from the gr prediction @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that this analysis used a very stiff eos with an incompressibility of @xmath6 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xcite .",
    "such a super - stiff incompressibility is more than twice the value of @xmath7 mev extracted from analyzing various experiments in terrestrial nuclear laboratories during the last 30 years @xcite .",
    "many kinds of modified gravity theories have been published ever since einstein published his gr in 1915 , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein for a very recent reviews . besides the newtonian potential ,",
    "an extra yukawa term naturally arise in the gravitational potential at the weak - field limit in some of these theories , e.g. , f(r ) @xcite , the nonsymmetric gravitational theory ( ngt ) @xcite and modified gravity ( mog ) @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a very recent review .",
    "such theories are able to explain successfully the well - known astrophysical observations , such as the flat galaxy rotation curves @xcite and the bullet cluster 1e0657 - 558 observations  @xcite in the absence of dark matter .",
    "basically , this is because particles with masses , besides the presumably massless graviton , may also carry the gravitational force @xcite . following fujii @xcite",
    ", we model effects of the modified gravity by adding a yukawa term to the conventional gravitational potential .    to our best knowledge , while various properties of neutron stars and gravitational waves have been used to probe the eos and gravity often individually , it is not so clear what observables should be used to effectively break the eos - gravity degeneracy . in this work ,",
    "we show that the simultaneous measurement of the ns mass and its pulsating frequencies is useful for breaking the eos - gravity degeneracy .",
    "model eoss for super - dense matter with or without the hadron - quark phase transition are considered . for hybrid stars ,",
    "the eos is constructed by using an extended isospin- and momentum - dependent nuclear effective interaction for the hyperonic phase , the mit bag model for the quark phase , and the gibbs conditions for the mixed phase .",
    "model parameters are constrained by existing experimental data whenever possible in constructing the eos . by turning on or off the hadron - quark phase transition , varying the mit bag constant or the strength of the yukawa term",
    ", we explore the possibility of breaking the eos - gravity degeneracy by using the mass and the frequencies of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 pulsating modes of neutron stars . since effects of the eos on properties of both neutron stars and gravitational waves are better known as a result of extensive previous studies in the literature , we focus on effects of the yukawa - type non - newtonian gravity on both the maximum mass and pulsating frequencies of neutron stars .",
    "while the ns maximum mass is found to increase , the frequencies of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 pulsating modes decrease with the increasing strength of the yukawa term .",
    "a simultaneous measurement of the ns mass and the frequency of one of its pulsating modes , preferably the @xmath0-model , can thus readily break the eos - gravity degeneracy , providing a useful reference for testing simultaneously both the strong - field gravity and supranuclear eos using x - rays and gravitational waves hopefully in the near future .",
    "despite the fact that gravity is the first force discovered in nature , the quest to unify it with other fundamental forces remains elusive because of its apparent weakness at short distance , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in developing grand unification theories , the conventional inverse - square - law ( isl ) of newtonian gravitational force has to be modified due to either the geometrical effect of the extra space - time dimensions predicted by string theories and/or the exchange of weakly interacting bosons , such as the neutral spin-1 vector @xmath8-boson @xcite , proposed in the super - symmetric extension of the standard model , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . as an ansatz ,",
    "fujii @xcite first proposed that the non - newtonian gravity can be described by adding a yukawa term to the conventional gravitational potential between two objects of mass @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a dimensionless strength parameter , @xmath13 is the length scale , and @xmath14 is the gravitational constant . in the boson exchange picture , the strength of the yukawa potential between two baryons can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for scalar / vector bosons , @xmath17 is the baryon mass , and @xmath18 ( in natural units ) , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the boson - baryon coupling constant and the boson mass , respectively . as mentioned earlier , the yukawa term appears naturally at the weak - field limit in several modern modified gravity theories and has been used to explain successfully the flat galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter @xcite .",
    "the light and weakly interacting @xmath8-boson is a favorite candidate mediating the extra interaction @xcite , and various new experiments in terrestrial laboratories have been proposed to search for the @xmath8-boson , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the search for evidence of the modified gravity is at the forefront of research in several sub - fields of natural sciences including geophysics , nuclear and particle physics , as well as astrophysics and cosmology , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "various upper limits on the deviation from the isl has been put forward down to femtometer range using different experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments have established a clear trend of increased strength @xmath12 at shorter length @xmath13 . in the short range down to @xmath21 m , ground state properties of nuclei , neutron - proton and neutron - lead scattering data as well as the spectroscopy of antiproton atoms have been used to set upper limits on the value of @xmath22 ( or equivalently the @xmath23 ) . shown in the left window of fig .",

    "we emphasize that below the upper limits shown here , the yukawa term has no effect on properties of finite nuclei and nuclear scatterings .",
    "for example , the upper limits on @xmath25 in the femtometer scale were obtained by requiring explicitly that the binding energies and charge radii of nuclei do not deviate from their experimental vales by more than @xmath26 @xcite . as a reference , the straight lines are the @xmath23 correlation for @xmath27  gev@xmath28 .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=245 ]    some justifications and cautions about using the yukawa term to model modified gravity in neutron stars are in order here",
    ". on one hand , the yukawa term only appears in some of the modified gravity theories at the weak - field limit while neutron stars have strong gravity fields .",
    "indeed , in this sense it is highly questionable whether one can use the fujii ansatz in studying neutron stars . on the other hand , considered as the fifth force due to the exchange of the @xmath8-boson , a yukawa term is possible independent of the strength of gravity . as mentioned earlier , to our best knowledge , currently there is no fundamental reason to select one theory over others for describing the strong - field gravity as long as the theory can explain all known facts from observations .",
    "our reason of choosing the fujii ansatz is mostly technical rather than physical . to our best knowledge",
    ", the yukawa - like non - newtonian gravity is the only form that has its strength and range parameters both limited using experimental data as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the short - range part while the constraints for longer ranges can be found in the literature , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "moreover , as we shall discuss in detail in the following , it is relatively easier to implement the fujii ansatz and study its effects on both static and oscillating properties of neutron stars , although its possible origins as a prediction of either the string theory or super - symmetric extension of the standard model may not be widely accepted .",
    "there are many different kinds of modified gravity theories , and all of them have their own field equations governing static properties of neutron stars .",
    "moreover , to determine the pulsating frequencies of neutron stars one has to use the first - order perturbations of the field equations",
    ". such kinds of much more complicated studies are interesting and are being pursued by us and others using some of the modified gravity theories .",
    "however , they are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "because of the degeneracy between the matter content and gravity in nss , a negative yukawa term can be considered effectively either as an anti - gravity @xcite or a stiffening of the eos @xcite . according to fujii @xcite ,",
    "the yukawa term in the boson exchange picture is simply part of the matter system in general relativity .",
    "therefore , effectively one can adjust the eos only while keep the same tov equation for the static equilibrium for nss . for infinite nuclear matter , the extra energy density due to the yukawa term is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the normalization volume",
    ", @xmath33 is the baryon number density , and @xmath34 . assuming a constant boson mass independent of the density , one obtains the additional pressure @xmath35 , which is just equal to the additional energy density . including effects of the reduced gravity through the yukawa term",
    ", the total pressure becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the nuclear pressure inside neutron stars . within this framework , the task of breaking the eos - gravity degeneracy has effectively become a question of separating effects of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    as it was emphasized by fujii @xcite , since the new vector boson contributes to the nuclear matter eos only through the combination @xmath22 , while both the coupling constant @xmath19 and the mass @xmath20 of the light and weakly interacting bosons are small , the value of @xmath22 can be large . on the other hand , by comparing the @xmath22 value with that of the ordinary vector boson @xmath39 , krivoruchenko et al .",
    "have pointed out that as long as the @xmath22 value of the @xmath8-boson is less than about 200 gev@xmath28 the internal structures of both finite nuclei and neutron stars will not change @xcite . however , global properties of neutron stars can be significantly modified @xcite .",
    "one of the key characteristics of the yukawa correction is its composition dependence , unlike einstein s gravity .",
    "thus , ideally one needs to use different coupling constants for various baryons existing in neutron stars .",
    "moreover , to our best knowledge , it is unknown if there is any and what might be the form and strength of the yukawa term in the hadron - quark mixed phase and the pure quark phase .",
    "thus , instead of introducing more parameters , for the purpose of this exploratory study , we assume that the @xmath38 term is an effective yukawa correction existing in all phases with the @xmath19 being an averaged coupling constant .    for the eoss of hybrid stars ,",
    "we consider a quark core covered by hyperons and leptons using models developed by us in several recent studies of ns properties @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the quark matter is described by the mit bag model with reasonable parameters widely used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the hyperonic eos is modeled by using an extended isospin- and momentum - dependent effective interaction ( mdi ) @xcite for the baryon octet with parameters constrained by empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter , hyper - nuclei , and heavy - ion reactions @xcite . in particular , the underlying eos of symmetric nuclear matter is constrained by comparing transport model predictions with data on collective flow and kaon production in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath40 with this interaction is chosen to increase approximately linearly with density ( i.e. , the mdi interaction with a symmetry energy parameter @xmath41 @xcite ) in agreement with available constraints around and below the saturation density @xcite .",
    "the gibbs construction was adopted to describe the hadron - quark phase transition @xcite .",
    "as known , the gibbs construction requires that both the baryon and charge chemical potentials are in equilibrium , and it leads to a smooth phase transition . on the other hand",
    ", the maxwell construction only requires the baryon chemical equilibrium , and the phase transition is first order . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more realistic eos of the mixed phase can be obtained from the wigner - seitz cell calculation by taking into account the coulomb and surface effects .",
    "the resulting eos lies between those from the gibbs and maxwell constructions .",
    "the latter can thus be viewed as two extreme cases corresponding to certain values of the surface tension parameter in the wigner - seitz cell calculation . for the bag constant",
    ", the original mit bag model gives a value of @xmath42 mev/@xmath43  @xcite , while from lattice calculations it is about @xmath44 mev/@xmath43  @xcite .",
    "thus , the bag constant can be viewed as a free parameter in a reasonable range . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compared the mass - radius relation with different values of the bag constant .",
    "it was shown that the phase transition happens at a higher density with a larger bag constant , while the maximum mass is insensitive to the value of the bag constant . to give a reasonable value of the transition density , we choose b@xmath45=170 mev ( i.e. , @xmath46 mev/@xmath43 ) or 180 mev ( i.e. , @xmath47 mev/@xmath43 ) in the present study .",
    "the u and d quarks are taken as massless and the mass of the strange quark is set to be 150 mev .",
    "similar to the previous work in the literature , the hybrid star is divided into the liquid core , the inner crust , and the outer crust from the center to surface . for the inner crust ,",
    "a parameterized eos of @xmath48 is adopted as in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the outer crust ,",

    "[ fig1 ] are the eoss for hybrid stars with mit bag constant @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 mev , respectively , with and without the yukawa contribution .",
    "the corresponding hadron - quark mixed phase above / below the pure hadron / quark phase covers the density range of @xmath51 to 6.56 and @xmath52 to 8.63 , respectively .",
    "including the yukawa term the eos stiffens as the value of @xmath22 increases .",
    "it is seen that the two sets of parameters , @xmath49 mev and @xmath53 50  gev@xmath28 or @xmath50 mev and @xmath53 40  gev@xmath28 , lead to approximately the same total pressure . as a reference , the mdi eos for the @xmath54 matter without hyperons and quarks is also shown .",

    "these eoss are constrained at sub - saturation densities by the eos of pure neutron matter calculated by a chiral effective field theory and at supra - saturation densities by the observed maximum masses of neutron stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that our eoss for the @xmath54 matter are very close to their eoss for the @xmath30 matter at low densities and are inside their soft - stiff eos band at high densities .",
    "we remak that our hadronic eos , as shown in ref .",

    "the corresponding radius is about 12.4 km .",
    "moreover , one can see that the maximum mass for the ns containing only the @xmath54 matter is similar to that for hybrid stars calculated with @xmath29=170 mev and @xmath63gev@xmath28 , although the radius is smaller for the @xmath54 star .",
    "compared to the latter , the softening of the eos due to the hyperonization and hadron - quark phase transition reduces , while the effective stiffening of the eos due to the reduced gravity increases both the ns maximum mass and the corresponding radius . to see more clearly relative effects of the bag constant @xmath64 and the yukawa term , shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "<S> a thorough understanding of many astrophysical phenomena associated with compact objects requires reliable knowledge about both the equation of state ( eos ) of super - dense nuclear matter and the theory of strong - field gravity simultaneously because of the eos - gravity degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> currently , variations of the neutron star ( ns ) mass - radius correlation from using alternative gravity theories are much larger than those from changing the ns matter eos within known constraints . </S>",
    "<S> at least two independent observables are required to break the eos - gravity degeneracy . using model eoss for hybrid stars and a yukawa - type non - newtonian gravity , we investigate both the mass - radius correlation and pulsating frequencies of nss . while the maximum mass of nss increases , the frequencies of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 pulsating modes are found to decrease with the increasing strength of the yukawa - type non - newtonian gravity , providing a useful reference for future determination simultaneously of both the strong - field gravity and the supranuclear eos by combining data of x - ray and gravitational wave emissions of neutron stars . </S>"
