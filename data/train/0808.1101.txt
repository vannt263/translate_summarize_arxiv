    "galaxies are not expected to form a poisson sampling of the distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "indeed , it has been known for some time that different populations of galaxies demonstrate different clustering strengths @xcite , showing that they can not all have a simple relationship linking their distribution with that of the matter .",
    "this galaxy bias severely limits our ability to extract cosmological data from galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the large - scale shape of the linear matter power spectrum is dependent on @xmath1 because of the change in the evolution of the jeans scale after matter - radiation equality @xcite .",
    "however , changes in the general shape of the power spectrum , such as that caused by this physical process , are hard to separate from galaxy bias , which also imprints a signature that changes smoothly with scale .",
    "galaxy bias can also affect mode - coupling in the power spectrum by changing the non - linear scale , which can lead to small changes in the baryon acoustic oscillation positions @xcite .",
    "such effects are beyond the scope of our work , and we concentrate here on the broad changes to the shape of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the simplest model of galaxy bias is local , linear , deterministic bias , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the galaxy overdensity field , and @xmath4 is the linear mass overdensity field . in this model ,",
    "the bias @xmath5 is constant in space , but can change for different galaxy populations .",
    "a more generic model may also include a stochastic element which enters the description as an additional term , @xmath6 . or the bias could be non - local , where it depends on a smoothed version of the density field . in this paper",
    ", we will only be concerned with the relation between the galaxy and mass power spectra , and therefore define a practical measure of galaxy bias @xmath7 such a model can incorporate some of the complexities discussed above , but is local in @xmath8-space , so can not include any mode coupling terms , which are expected to be present .",
    "as we move to large scales , the galaxy bias is expected to tend towards a constant value .",
    "the simplest model for this is the peak - background split model @xcite . here",
    "galaxy formation depends on the local density field .",
    "large scale density modes can alter the local galaxy number density by pushing pieces of the density field above a critical threshold . on large scales",
    "we expect a linear relationship between the large scale mode amplitudes and the change in number density , so the shape of the galaxy and mass power spectra are the same .",
    "interestingly , such a linear relationship is broken if the density field has a non - gaussian component @xcite . on small scales",
    "we expect galaxy clustering to be different from that of the mass , as pairs of galaxies inside single collapsed structures become important @xcite .",
    "although large - scale bias is seen as a nuisance when extracting cosmological information from galaxy power spectra , it does provide constraints on possible galaxy formation models .",
    "@xcite proposed bivariate lognormal models of relative bias motivated by observations of galaxy distributions .",
    "the data were found to support a small ( everywhere @xmath95% ) , but significant , amount of stochasticity and non - linearity in these models on all scales , implying that galaxy formation is not solely a function of local density ; these effects must be understood in order to properly utilise the next generation of galaxy surveys . a related work , @xcite , also supported these findings .    in order to use the power spectrum to extract cosmological information , we need to investigate the transition between scale - independent and scale - dependent galaxy bias . this transition is known to be a function of the galaxy population chosen . comparing work in @xcite and @xcite , which used the same techniques , and",
    "the analysis of @xcite , shows that there are deviations between the shapes of the 2dfgrs and sdss galaxy power spectra .",
    "if this results from galaxy bias and the fact that the 2dfgrs selected galaxies in a blue band whilst the sdss selected galaxies in a red band , then we should expect that similar changes show up in red and blue galaxies drawn from a single survey . using the sdss , @xcite showed that at @xmath10 , the shape of the power spectrum is a strong function of the @xmath11-band luminosity . in this paper",
    "we extend this work by splitting in galaxy colour and luminosity , and by fitting models to the resulting power spectra , in order to see if the sdss contains sufficient galaxies to fully explain the trend observed between sdss and 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "previous work examining the observed dependence of the large scale bias on luminosity was carried out by @xcite who proposed the phenomenological model @xmath12 , @xcite extended this to better fit the available data by including an extra parameter in the form @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite reexamined both these models for samples split by galaxy colour .",
    "@xcite also examined the colour dependence of relative bias .",
    "@xcite presented colour dependent and luminosity dependent measurements of the projected correlation function of sdss galaxies . in",
    "all cases subsets of the data existed where some aspect of the bias model in question was shown to be a function of colour or luminosity .",
    "we first describe the sdss catalogues we use in section  [ sec : cats ] , and how we model the radial selection function of our subsamples using luminosity function fits in section  [ sec : sel_func ] .",
    "section  [ sec : calc_spectra ] describes our calculation of power spectra and uncertainties , and the bias models to be fitted are presented in section  [ sec : bias ] .",
    "results of fitting the bias models are given in section  [ sec : results ] . in section",

    "we use galaxy catalogues selected from the sloan digital sky survey dr5 main galaxy sample . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , which was recently completed , used a 2.5 m telescope @xcite to obtain @xmath14 square degrees of imaging data in five passbands @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath11 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the main galaxy sample @xcite consists of galaxies with petrosian @xmath11-band magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "this gives approximately @xmath20 galaxies per square degree , with a median redshift @xmath21 ; in this paper we use the dr5 sample @xcite .",
    "we exclude a small subset of the data taken during initial survey operation , for which the apparent magnitude limit fluctuated .",

    "this is the catalogue used in @xcite , and further details can be found here .    where specified , we have k - corrected the galaxy luminosities using the methodology outlined in @xcite .",

    "the limits of the absolute magnitude bins are given , with the weighted mean and standard deviation .",
    "we also give the galaxy count for each bin . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]         , but now for model power spectra calculated assuming the @xmath30-model for galaxy bias .",

    "comparisons are shown for the red galaxies in the left hand panels and blue galaxies on the right , with the rows of panels showing different absolute magnitude bins with the brightest at the top and faintest at the bottom .",
    "the offset visible between the data and model in the lower left panel is due to the high best - fit large - scale bias in the best - fit solution ( eq .  [ eqn : linearmagbias ] , fit parameters given in table  [ table : param_fits ] ) .",
    "such effects arise because the data are correlated , and the maximum likelihood solution does not match the @xmath31-by - eye expectation .",
    "+      +    in this section we try to fit a simple model for the luminosity dependence of the parameters in the bias models given in eqns .",
    "[ eqn : scalebias_eqn1 ]  &  [ eqn : scalebias_eqn2 ] .    the asymptotic large - scale bias @xmath32 is known to be a function of galaxy luminosity @xcite , and galaxy colour @xcite . here , we extend the form of the model introduced by @xcite in order to cope with the more complicated behaviour seen when we also split galaxies by colour .",
    "we assume the three parameter model @xmath33 for relative biases where @xmath34 , we would have that @xmath35 , so the model would only have two free parameters .",
    "this model reduces to the form of @xcite in the case of @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , we parametrise @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are parameters that we can fit to the data .",
    "we therefore have 5 free parameters in our fit to the data in addition to choice of whether to use the p or @xmath43-model .",
    "we have fitted these parameters by performing a simultaneous maximum likelihood search using all 12 power spectra , and allowing for covariances between band powers in each , and between different power spectra .",
    "i.e. we do not simply fit the recovered data values in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_param_vs_mag ] , but instead perform a new fit to the data .",

    "[ fig : bias_param_vs_mag ] .",
    "[ fig : pk_qmodel_bm ] ]    the resulting best - fit parameters allow us to define the following models for redshift - space galaxy power spectra .",

    "these model power spectra are compared with those observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_pmodel_bm ] where , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_qmodel_bm ] , good agreement is seen .",
    "the @xmath49 values of the best - fit models including the @xmath30-model of bias are good , with @xmath50 given @xmath51 degrees - of - freedom for the red galaxies and @xmath52 for the blue galaxies given the same number of degrees of freedom for the blue galaxies .",
    "for the @xmath43-model , the corresponding numbers are @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "these numbers depend strongly on the covariance model adopted and , as a consequence , we do not analyse these further other than to note that the fits seem to give reasonable numbers .",
    "we have quantified the bias of red and blue galaxies as a function of luminosity on scales @xmath55 .",
    "we find clear differences in the large - scale asymptotic bias between blue and red galaxies , similar to that found by @xcite and @xcite , and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_param_vs_mag ] . at large scales",
    "red galaxies have are more biased than blue galaxies for all luminosities .",
    "the bias of blue galaxies is a strong , monotonically increasing function of luminosity , with more luminous galaxies being the most biased . for red galaxies ,",
    "the picture is more complicated , with an increase in the bias of faint red galaxies ( @xcite find a similar result but stress the scale dependence of the observation ) .",
    "this trend is significant at the @xmath56 level.we find a stronger bias for luminous blue galaxies , compared with that of @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is unknown , although it is worth noting that our catalogue is larger than that used by @xcite , as they used additional cuts , constructing volume limited subsamples , compared with our sample selection procedure ( see section [ sec : cats ] ) .",
    "we performed a simple test of the dependence of this difference on observed scale , repeating our analysis for scales @xmath57 which approximates the @xcite measurement scale of @xmath58 , the discrepancy in the bias of the brightest blue galaxies was not removed .",
    "however , the change of scales brought the best fit red galaxy linear bias model into better agreement with the @xcite faint , red galaxies ; the model is poorly constrained at the faint end due to the lack of unique data points in that range .",
    "it is worth noting that , due to different colour cut criteria , the brightest absolute magnitude bins in @xcite are inherently more red than ours , this might lead one to expect larger bias measurements for those bins , the opposite of the observed trend . the bright blue sample contains the smallest numbers of galaxies , so the errors on the relative bias should be the largest of any sample .",
    "however , our expected errors are insufficient to fully explain the discrepancy , and there remains no obvious reason for this difference .",
    "the work on constant bias models has been extended by considering how the turn - off from constant large - scale bias depends on galaxy colour and luminosity .",
    "we have compared two models for this turn - off : the @xmath30-model and @xmath43-model given in eqns .",
    "[ eqn : scalebias_eqn1 ] &  [ eqn : scalebias_eqn2 ] respectively .",
    "we find that there is little to choose between the two in terms of how well they can fit the current data , and both provide adequate fits to the power spectrum trends observed as a function of galaxy luminosity and colour at the current level of data precision .",
    "although there is no observational motivation , @xcite argued that the @xmath30-model has a physical motivation , and therefore offers a more attractive model of bias .",
    "we use the values of @xmath30 and @xmath43 obtained for these two models to quantify the degree of divergence from a constant bias model .",
    "note that these parameters change both the position and amplitude of the turn - off .",
    "we find that the best - fit values of @xmath30 and @xmath43 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_param_vs_mag ] , are a strong function of luminosity for blue galaxies .",
    "red galaxies show far weaker evolution with luminosity , and are consistent with the hypothesis of no change in the scale at which the bias can no longer be described as a constant , to current data precision .",
    "interestingly , this trend in the turn - off from apparent scale - independent behaviour does not match that of the amplitude of the large - scale bias .",
    "if amplitude and turn - off scale were linked , we might have expected the @xmath43 and @xmath30 parameters to match for red galaxies of high or low luminosity , where the constant bias component matches , but be different for intermediate luminosity galaxies .",
    "we do not observe such a trend , suggesting that there might not be a simple link between the amplitude of bias and the scale at which the 1-halo term becomes important .",
    "it is clear that the simple @xmath30 and @xmath43-models will become insufficient to model the observational data , both on very small scales , and as the data improve .",
    "they are , after all , simply motivated to fit observed trends , and do not encompass all of the physics involved .",
    "one alternative and more complex prescription for bias prediction is that presented in @xcite which can predict @xmath59 given a set of cosmological parameters and a hod model , the parameters of which have been determined from the observed , projected correlation function ( the correlation function provides additional information to that of the power spectrum as they are sensitive to different scales ) .",
    "however , the potential limits of simple , phenomenological models , such as the @xmath30 and @xmath43-models , does not stop us being able to use them to investigate trends in the data , as we have done in this paper .",
    "the current data clearly show that , on relatively large scales ( our small scale limit of @xmath60 approximately corresponds to @xmath61 ) , blue and red galaxies have very different bias properties .",
    "it is the blue galaxies that are faint in the @xmath11-band whose relative clustering on different scales most closely resembles that of the mass , and the luminous blue galaxies the least .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the shapes of the 2dfgrs and sdss main galaxy power spectra of @xcite and @xcite differ because the average galaxy bias of each sample differs , caused by different sample selections .",
    "the clustering of the 2dfgrs galaxies , on average , would be expected to be a better tracer of the linear clustering signal out to smaller scales than the sdss galaxies .",
    "this highlights the importance of sample selection for future galaxy surveys , and the importance of understanding galaxy bias for extracting cosmological information from power spectrum shapes from such surveys .",
    "red and blue galaxies show very different trends in their large - scale bias and the scale - dependent smaller - scale bias as a function of luminosity .",
    "it is clear that galaxies need to be split into sub - populations by more than just the luminosity in a single band in order to properly understand and model bias .",
