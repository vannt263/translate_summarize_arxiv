    "<S> the effective coupling between the chain and bath @xmath100 is very small . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the usual pauli blocking there is another mechanism which explains the very weak coupling between the subsystems . because the nearest neighbor occupation @xmath101 is also small we can approximately project out all states where nearest - neighbor sites in the bath are occupied </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an effective density - density interaction @xmath102 between the subsystems , leading to a slow relaxation for small @xmath36 @xcite . in this strong coupling limit , the hybridization part of the hamiltonian eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) also gets projected @xmath103 explaining the small value for the effective coupling given above . </S>",
    "<S> thus the interactions help to decouple the two subsystems explaining the almost perfect free fermi distribution in the chain for @xmath98 .    </S>",

    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have studied thermalization in a strongly correlated model which can be viewed either as a closed quantum system or as a free fermionic chain coupled to a bath . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the common approach of using a lindblad equation to study open quantum systems , our model has a microscopically specified bath . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we can simulate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system _ and _ bath , and directly compare the two different viewpoints . for low particle densities we have shown that an equation of motion approach on the hartree - fock level is sufficient to quantitatively describe the intermediate time dynamics . at this level </S>",
    "<S> only slow dephasing processes are captured . for the future it seems promising to use a higher order decoupling which might also capture the faster relaxation processes which we observe in the numerical simulations . while the relaxation rate @xmath104 at small interactions or low densities is too small to observe equilibration within the limited numerical simulation time we do observe thermalization at stronger interactions near half filing where @xmath105 is larger . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the relaxation rate changes continuously with the microscopic parameters of the model so that the definition of a ` nonequilibrium phase transition ' based on the accessible simulation time @xmath45 seems problematic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , we find that strong interactions lead to an effective disentanglement between the subsystems and therefore increase the decoherence times . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , even an extremely simple bath where markovian dynamics can not be taken for granted can be sufficient to fully equilibrate a subsystem without intrinsic relaxation processes .    </S>",
