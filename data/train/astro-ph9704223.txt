    "diffuse interstellar clouds of visual extinction @xmath10 mag represent the intermediate case between _ atomic clouds _ in which the molecular fraction is very small and _ dense molecular clouds _ in which gas is almost fully molecular ; as such , they represent the best laboratories in which to study the formation and destruction of molecular hydrogen .",
    "direct observations of molecular hydrogen in diffuse molecular clouds have been severely hampered by the absence of any dipole - allowed transitions at radio , infrared or visible wavelengths .",
    "given current instrumental sensitivities , direct measurements of the h@xmath0 abundance in diffuse clouds can only be obtained from observations of the _ dipole - allowed _ electronic transitions of the lyman and werner bands .",
    "these transitions , which lie in the @xmath11   spectral region , were detected by the _",
    "copernicus _ satellite in absorption toward more than one hundred background sources ( spitzer et al .",
    "1973 ; savage et al .  1979 ) .",
    "although the planned _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) will allow such absorption line studies to be carried out toward fainter background sources than those observed with _ copernicus _ , direct observations of molecular hydrogen will continue to allow only sparse spatial sampling of diffuse molecular clouds .",
    "an alternative  although less direct  means of studying the distribution of h@xmath0 in diffuse molecular clouds is afforded by the combination of hi 21 cm observations and 100 @xmath1 m continuum observations carried out by the iras satellite .",
    "the diffuse cloud that has been studied most extensively by this method is g236 + 39 , an isolated high - latitude cloud ( galactic coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) of angular size @xmath14 degrees for which reach , koo & heiles ( 1994 ) have used the arecibo radio telescope to obtain a complete hi map at a spatial resolution ( 3 arcminutes ) comparable to that of the iras beam ( @xmath15 arcminutes ) . given the absence of any stellar sources associated with g236 + 39 , the distance is unfortunately not well determined .",
    "figure 1 , based upon data kindly provided in electronic form by w.  reach , shows the hi column densities , @xmath16 , and 100 @xmath1 m continuum intensities , @xmath17 , for more than 4000 lines of sight toward this cloud . assuming that @xmath17 is linearly proportional to the column density of h nuclei , @xmath18 , reach et al",
    ".  argued that the higher ratios of @xmath19 typically observed when @xmath16 is large represented the effects of molecule formation along the line of sight .",
    "this allowed the h@xmath0 column density to be estimated as @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the 100 @xmath1 m emission coefficient per h _ nucleus _ , a quantity that could be determined from the slope of the @xmath17 versus @xmath16 correlation in the small column density limit where the molecular fraction was negligible .",
    "the chemistry of diffuse molecular clouds has been the subject of extensive theoretical study over the past 25 years ( e.g. black & dalgarno 1977 ; van dishoeck & black 1986 ; spaans 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "common to all theoretical models for diffuse molecular clouds are the assumptions that the formation of molecular hydrogen takes place by means of grain surface reactions and that the destruction of h@xmath0 occurs primarily by photodissociation . because photodissociation of h@xmath0 follows _ line absorption _ of ultraviolet radiation in the lyman and werner bands , the photodissociation rate is diminished by self - shielding and shows a strong depth - dependence .",
    "most previous studies of diffuse cloud chemistry have assumed a one - dimensional plane - parallel geometry , in which a geometrically - thin slab is illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from either one or two sides .",
    "the solid curve in figure 1 shows the predicted variation of @xmath17 with @xmath16 for a series of slab models illuminated from two sides with a constant assumed density of h nuclei and a variable column density . as described in  3 below",
    ", the assumed 100@xmath1 m emissivity per h nucleus and the cloud density have been chosen to optimize the fit to the data . in the limit of small @xmath16",
    ", the predicted relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath16 is linear , but for @xmath22 , the molecular hydrogen fraction becomes significant and the curve turns upwards .",
    "while a one - dimensional slab model can evidently account for the gross properties of the data plotted in figure 1 , we have investigated in this study whether a _ better _ fit to the data can be obtained with models in which a _ three - dimensional _ cloud structure is assumed .",
    "thus instead of modeling the cloud g236 + 39 as a `` cardboard cutout '' that has an extent along the line of sight that is very much smaller than its extent in the plane - of - the - sky , we have constructed a series of three - dimensional models in which we assume the cloud to have a significant geometrical thickness perpendicular to the plane of the sky . in other words , we include the photodissociative effects of radiation that is incident upon the cloud from the sides as well as along the line of sight .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the numerical method used to model the formation and dissociation of h@xmath0 in a three - dimensional diffuse cloud of arbitrary shape . in ",
    "3 we investigate whether our three - dimensional models describe more accurately than one - dimensional models the correlation between iras 100 @xmath1 m emission and hi column density for the line of sight toward the cirrus cloud g236 + 39 .",
    "the results of our investigation are discussed in  4 .",
    "we have constructed a model for the equilibrium h@xmath0 abundance within a three - dimensional molecular cloud with a constant density of h nuclei and an arbitrary shape .",
    "this study extends the spherical cloud models described by neufeld & spaans ( 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that molecular hydrogen is formed catalytically on dust grains at a rate @xmath23 per unit volume , where @xmath24 is the density of hydrogen atoms , @xmath25 is the density of hydrogen nuclei , and @xmath26 is an effective rate coefficient with a  canonical value \" of @xmath27 ( jura 1974 ) corresponding to @xmath28 .    the destruction of h@xmath0 is dominated by spontaneous radiative dissociation , following the absorption of 9121110 ultraviolet radiation in the lyman and werner bands . given the estimate of draine ( 1978 ) for the mean uv interstellar radiation field , and the lyman and werner band oscillator strengths and photodissociation probabilities of allison & dalgarno ( 1970 ) and stephens & dalgarno ( 1972 ) , the photodissociation rate for an unshielded h@xmath0 molecule is @xmath29 . once the lyman and werner transitions become optically - thick , the photodissociation rate is diminished due to self - shielding . in modeling the decrease of the photodissociation rate due to self - shielding along any given ray , we adopt the expression given by tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) for the self - shielding function for spectral lines with a voigt profile .",
    "we assume that dust absorption decreases the photodissociation rate further by a factor @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the visual extinction along the ray .",

    "we therefore make the simplest assumption that the ultraviolet radiation field is isotropic , @xmath42 .",
    "the equilibrium h@xmath0 abundance at point p is given by @xmath43 the h@xmath0 abundance is a decreasing function of the parameter @xmath44 , which characterizes the relative rates of h@xmath0 photodissociation and h@xmath0 formation . in our computer model for the formation and photodissociation of h@xmath0 in three - dimensional clouds , the angular integration in equation ( 1 )",

    "the h@xmath0 abundance was computed at every point using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . since the shielding column densities @xmath35 $ ] that enter equation ( 1 )",
    "depend upon the molecular abundances obtained in equation ( 2 ) , an iterative method was used to obtain a simultaneous solution , with the convergence criterion that the change in h@xmath0 abundance between successive iterations was everywhere less than 1% .    to verify the accuracy of our computer code ,",
    "one - dimensional plane - parallel slab calculations were performed and compared with results obtained from the 1-d computer code of black & van dishoeck ( 1987 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows a representative computation for a model slab with @xmath49 k , @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 mag .",

    "the iras cloud g236 + 39 is an isolated , high latitude ( @xmath12 ) cirrus cloud that provides an excellent test case in which our three - dimensional diffuse cloud models can be assessed .",
    "the absence of any stellar sources associated with g236 + 39 causes the distance to be not well determined .",
    "as described in  1 above , reach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have used the arecibo radiotelescope to map the hi 21 cm line emission from g236 + 39 at an angular resolution of 3 arcminutes , yielding estimates of the hi column density along 4421 lines of sight through this cloud .",
    "we obtained estimates of the iras 100 @xmath1 m continuum intensity radiated by g236 + 39 along the same lines of sight , using the irsky facility made available by ipac to estimate and subtract the 100 @xmath1 m background .",
    "we then interpreted the background - subtracted 100 @xmath1 m intensity map as a `` topographical contour map '' of the cloud , assuming that the intensity at each position is proportional to the spatial extent of the cloud along the line of sight .",
    "two critical assumptions underlie this interpretation : we assume ( 1 ) that the 100 @xmath1 m intensity is linearly proportional to the column density of h nuclei ( boulanger & prault 1988 ) , i.e. that @xmath54 with @xmath55 constant ; and ( 2 ) that the density of h nuclei within the cloud , @xmath56 , is also constant . with these assumptions , the linear extent along the line of sight is @xmath57 .",
    "both the assumptions of constant @xmath55 and of constant @xmath56 are plausible for a diffuse cloud such as g236 + 39 . in general",
    ", we expect @xmath55 to increase with increasing depth into a cloud because the ultraviolet radiation that heats the dust responsible for the 100 @xmath1 m continuum emission is itself attenuated by dust absorption . however , the extinction to the center of g236 + 39 is relatively small ( @xmath58  mag ) , and the absence of any correlation between the @xmath59 intensity ratio and the 100 @xmath1 m intensity argues against any significant variation in the dust temperature ( and thus in @xmath55 ) within the cloud ( reach et al .",
    "similarly , considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium imply that the cloud is only slightly self - gravitating so that the pressure is not expected to vary significantly within the cloud . since the total pressure in diffuse clouds is dominated by microturbulent rather than thermal motions ( van dishoeck & black 1989 ; crawford & barlow 1996 ) , and",
    "since there is no evidence for significant gradients in the microturbulent line widths , the absence of significant variations in the pressure implies that the total mass density ( or equivalently , the density of h nuclei , @xmath60 is roughly constant ) .",
    "our assumption that the 100 @xmath1 m intensity at each position is proportional to the spatial extent of the cloud along the line of sight does not determine the three - dimensional shape of the cloud uniquely .",
    "because the 100 @xmath1 m intensity measures only the extent of the cloud along the line of sight but not its location , a given 100 @xmath1 m map is consistent with a whole set of cloud shapes that are related by shears perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "thus we specify a unique cloud shape be making the additional ( and admittedly arbitrary ) assumption that the cloud possesses reflection symmetry about the plane of the sky .",
    "while all our three - dimensional models for g236 + 39 are based upon the assumption that the cloud thickness along the line of sight is proportional to the measured 100 @xmath1 m intensity , we have varied the _ constant of proportionality _ in that relationship so as to obtain the best fit to the data .",
    "each model may be characterized conveniently by an elongation factor @xmath61 which describes the degree of elongation along the line of sight : @xmath62 where @xmath63/(r_0 n_{\\rm h})$ ] is the maximum assumed thickness of the cloud , @xmath64 $ ] is the maximum 100 @xmath1 m intensity , and @xmath65 is the projected area of the half - maximum intensity contour , @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the factor @xmath67 has been introduced so that the elongation factor @xmath61 is defined as unity for the case of a sphere ; elongation factors smaller than unity then apply to oblate shapes that are flattened along the line of sight while elongation factors greater than unity apply to prolate shapes that are elongated along the line of sight . in this notation ,",
    "the one - dimensional geometry traditionally used to model molecular clouds is described by the limiting case @xmath68 .    for g236 + 39 ,",
    "the angular area of the half - maximum 100 @xmath1 m intensity contour is @xmath69 , corresponding to a physical area @xmath70 for an assumed distance to the source of @xmath4 .",
    "the elongation factor is then related to the density @xmath56 by the expression @xmath71      given the observed iras 100 @xmath1 m map for g236 + 39 , the molecular fraction can be predicted at every point in the cloud using the methods described in  2 above .",
    "the results depend upon three parameters : the 100 @xmath1 m emission coefficient per h nucleus , @xmath55 ; the elongation factor , @xmath61 ; and the quantity @xmath44 , which represents the relative rates of h@xmath0 photodissociation and h@xmath0 formation ( see  2 above ) .",
    "once predictions have been obtained for the h@xmath0 abundance everywhere in the cloud , a predicted hi column density map can be obtained by integrating @xmath72 along each line of sight .",
    "we use a standard @xmath2 analysis to compare the predicted hi map with the observations of reach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and thereby to constrain the values of @xmath55 , @xmath61 , and @xmath44 . assuming that the hi observations have a _ fractional _ error that is roughly the same for each line of sight ( reach et al .",

    ", we have constructed a series of models of increasing elongation factor , @xmath61 .",
    "for each such model , we have varied the other parameters , @xmath55 and @xmath44 , so as to minimize @xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the smallest value of @xmath2 that can be achieved for fixed elongation factor , as a function of @xmath61 , relative to the minimum value that can be achieved for any elongation factor , @xmath77 .",
    "figure 3 shows clearly that the global minimum in @xmath2 is obtained for non - zero @xmath61 .",
    "the best estimate of @xmath61 is 0.9 , and the standard error on that estimate is 0.1 . given the statistical properties of the @xmath2 parameter , the results show at the @xmath78 level that a three - dimensional model with @xmath79 provides a better fit to the data than a one - dimensional ( @xmath68 ) model .",
    "the comparison between the 3-d ( @xmath79 ) and 1-d ( @xmath68 ) models can be illustrated graphically in at least three other ways . in figure 4",
    ", we show the histogram of @xmath80 values for all 4421 lines of sight ; the 3-d model clearly yields a narrower distribution .",
    "figure 5 shows the values of @xmath80 as a function of @xmath74 .",
    "again , the 3-d model ( upper panel ) clearly shows a tighter fit to the data , and another feature of the results becomes apparent : the 1-d model ( lower panel ) systematically underpredicts the hi column density ( i.e.  overpredicts the molecular fraction ) when @xmath81 and overpredicts the hi column density when @xmath82 .",
    "this behavior is also exhibited by the false color figures displayed in plate 1 . here",
    "the two left panels show the value of @xmath80 for every line of sight toward g236 + 39 , the upper left panel applying to the 1-d model and the lower left panel to the 3-d model .",
    "values of @xmath80 close to unity appear green in this figure while values greater than unity appear yellow or red and values smaller than unity appear blue or violet .",
    "again , the 3-d model yields a better fit to the data , and the 1-d model shows a systematic tendency to underestimate the hi column density ( and overestimate the molecular fraction ) near the edges of the cloud , where the hi column density lies in the range @xmath83 .",
    "this tendency arises because the 1-d model does not include the photodissociative effects of radiation propagating in the plane of the sky ; near the edges of the cloud , such radiation is attenuated by an h@xmath0 column density that is considerably less than the column density along the line of sight , so the 1-d model significantly underestimates the photodissociation rate .",
    "the right hand panels in plate 1 compare the observed ratio of the 100 @xmath1 m continuum intensity to the hi column density ( lower right panel ) with the predicted ratios for the best fit 3-d model ( middle right panel ) and the best fit 1-d model ( upper right panel ) .",
    "the ratio of the 100 @xmath1 m continuum intensity to the hi column density is a measure of the mean molecular fraction along the line of sight ; once again , the 3-d model clearly provides a better fit .",
    "the parameters derived for the best fit 1-d model ( with the elongation factor @xmath61 fixed at zero ) and the best fit 3-d model ( with @xmath61 taking whatever value optimizes the fit to the data ) are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "even the 3-d models do not completely determine the cloud parameters , because the @xmath2 analysis places constraints upon three variables ( @xmath55 , @xmath61 , and @xmath84 $ ] ) whereas the total number of unknown parameters is five ( @xmath55 , @xmath41 , @xmath56 , @xmath85 and @xmath4 ) . adopting",
    " canonical values \" for the ultraviolet radiation field ( @xmath86 ) and for the h@xmath0 formation rate coefficient ( @xmath28 ) , we obtain estimates of @xmath87 for the 100 @xmath1 m emission coefficient per h nucleus , @xmath55 ; @xmath88 for the density of h nuclei , @xmath56 ; and @xmath89  pc for the distance to the source , @xmath4 .",
    "( all the error bounds given here are @xmath90 statistical uncertainties . )",
    "figure 6 shows the three - dimensional shape of the cloud g236 + 39 that is implied by the elongation factor that we derived .",
    "the @xmath2 analysis described in  3.2 above establishes convincingly that the abundance of h@xmath0 in g236 + 39 is explained more successfully by a 3-d model than by a 1-d model .",
    "furthermore , the 3-d model provides a distance estimate of @xmath91  pc which is at least consistent with the known scale height of cold hi in the galaxy .      as a further test of our method ,",
    "we have applied it to a set of artificial 100 @xmath1 m and hi 21 cm maps that we generated for the case of a triaxial spheriod of elongation factor unity . after adding artificial noise to those maps",
    ", we attempted to reconstruct the elongation factor for that spheriod using a @xmath2 analysis exactly analogous to that described in  3.2 .",
    "the elongation factor was indeed recovered successfully , the derived value being @xmath92 .",
    "full details of this analysis and figures analogous to those described in  3 are presented in the appendix .      despite its apparent success in providing a better fit to the observational data than a 1-d model , our 3-d model",
    "is clearly idealized in that we have made several simplifying assumptions .",
    "the assumptions of constant @xmath56 and @xmath55 have already been discussed in  3.1 above .",
    "our assumption that the cloud g236 + 39 shows reflection symmetry about the plane of the sky has also been discussed ; because we assume that all the low - level 100 @xmath1 m emission near the edges of the cloud arises from material that is located close to the symmetry plane , this assumption probably leads to an overestimate of the degree of shielding at the cloud center .",
    "a further simplifying assumption is our adoption of an isotropic incident radiation field .",
    "we have also assumed that the h@xmath0 chemistry is in equilibrium , with the rate of photodissociation equal to the rate of formation .",
    "the timescale for establishing such a chemical equilibrium is @xmath93 .",
    "( note that the estimate given by reach et al .",
    "1994 is too large by an order of magnitude . ) for comparison , we may define a crossing timescale as the ratio of the cloud size to the hi linewidth , @xmath94/ ( n_{\\rm h } r_0 \\delta v ) \\sim 3 \\rm \\,myr$ ] , where @xmath95 is the typical hi linewidth .",
    "the fact that @xmath96 exceeds @xmath97 does not necessarily invalidate our assumption of chemical equilibrium . even assuming that turbulent motions contribute significantly to the line width",
    ", we would expect that turbulent mixing will tend to decrease the molecular fraction in the cloud interior only if @xmath96 also exceeds the turbulent diffusion timescale , @xmath98 , which we expect to be larger than @xmath97 by the ratio of the cloud size to the effective mixing length . turning the argument around",
    ", we suggest that the success of our equilibrium models in explaining the observations implies that @xmath98 is indeed _ long _ relative to @xmath96 and that the ratio of the cloud size to the effective mixing length is greater than @xmath99 .      we anticipate several future extensions to the study presented in this paper .",
    "thus far , we have only applied our 3-d modeling methods to the single source g236 + 39 ; one obvious extension will be their application to other isolated diffuse clouds .",
    "in addition , we expect that observations at other wavelengths will provide useful additional probes of the physical and chemical conditions in diffuse clouds such as g236 + 39 .",
    "in particular , cii fine structure emissions in the @xmath100 line near 158 @xmath1 m would provide a valuable independent probe of the density and a check on our assumption that @xmath56 is roughly constant .",
    "except at the cloud center , from which co emissions have been detected ( reach et al .",
    "1994 ) , we expect c@xmath101 to be the dominant reservoir of gas - phase carbon nuclei in g236 + 39 ; thus c@xmath101 will have a roughly constant abundance relative to h nuclei . because the density in diffuse clouds is very much smaller than the critical density for the cii @xmath100 transition , the frequency - integrated cii line intensity will therefore be proportional to @xmath102 , and the cii line equivalent width will be proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ ( sofia ) , as well as planned balloon - borne telescopes will provide ideal platforms for carrying out cii observations of diffuse clouds .",
    "we note that only a relatively small telescope ( with a 20  cm diameter primary mirror ) is needed to provide a beam size at 158 @xmath1 m that matches the beam size of the arecibo radiotelescope for h 21 cm observations .",
    "the far ultraviolet is another spectral region that is important for the study of molecular hydrogen in diffuse clouds . in particular",
    ", the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ will permit the direct measurement of h@xmath0 column densities in absorption along specific lines of sight toward ultraviolet continuum sources . although the spatial sampling provided by such absorption line studies will be limited by the availability of bright background sources",
    ", fuse observations will provide a very valuable complement to the indirect methods for studying h@xmath0 that have been described in this paper .",
    "we are very grateful to w.  reach for making available the h 21 cm map of g236 + 39 , and to e.  van  dishoeck for allowing us to use her computer code as a check on our results in the limit @xmath68 .",

    "<S> we have constructed three - dimensional models for the equilibrium abundance of molecular hydrogen within diffuse interstellar clouds of arbitrary geometry that are illuminated by ultraviolet radiation . the position - dependent photodissociation rate of h@xmath0 within such clouds was computed using a 26-ray approximation to model the attenuation of the incident ultraviolet radiation field by dust and by h@xmath0 line absorption .    </S>",
    "<S> we have applied our modeling technique to the isolated diffuse cloud g236 + 39 , assuming that the cloud has a constant density and that the thickness of the cloud along the line of sight is at every point proportional to the 100 @xmath1 m continuum intensity measured by iras . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our model can successfully account for observed variations in the ratio of 100 @xmath1 m continuum intensity to hi column density , with larger values of that ratio occurring along lines of sight in which the molecular hydrogen fraction is expected to be largest .    using a standard @xmath2 analysis to assess the goodness of fit of our models , we find ( at the 60@xmath3 level ) that a three - dimensional model is more successful in matching the observational data than a one - dimensional model in which the geometrical extent of the cloud along the line of sight is assumed to be very much smaller than its extent in the plane - of - the - sky . if @xmath4 is the distance to g236 + 39 , and given standard assumptions about the rate of grain - catalysed h@xmath0 formation , we find that the cloud has an extent along the line of sight that is @xmath5 times its mean extent projected onto the plane of the sky ; a gas density of @xmath6 h nuclei per @xmath7 ; and is illuminated by a radiation field of @xmath8 times the mean interstellar radiation field estimated by draine ( 1978 ) . </S>",
