    "a sequence of measurements made on a quantum system leads to number of random outcomes , observed by an experimentalist . in this sense ,",
    "the composite system+meter(s ) may be seen as following a path across a stochastic network , connecting all possible measurement results . the same can be said about a purely classical system , and the quantum nature of the experiment reveals itself in the manner , in which the transition probabilities are calculated . while a classical theory allows for non - invasive observations , a quantum meter plays an active role in `` shaping '' the network . in the simplest case of von neumann ( vn ) measurements",
    "@xcite , the transition probabilities , as well as the observed events themselves , are determined by the virtual paths available to the studied system , the nature of the measured quantity , and the accuracy of the meter(s ) .",
    "perhaps the most studied network is produced by an accurate vn measurement of a projector on a state @xmath0 ( preparation , or pre - selection ) , followed by a not necessarily accurate vn measurement of an operator @xmath1 , followed by an accurate measurement of a projector on a final state @xmath2 ( post - selection ) @xcite .",
    "post - selection may succeed or fail , and a sub - ensemble is selected by collecting the statistics only in the case it is successful . if @xmath1 has @xmath3 distinct eigenvalues , there a @xmath3 virtual paths connecting the two states , for which quantum mechanics provides probability amplitudes , but not probabilities , if the system is considered in isolation .",
    "if the measurement of @xmath1 is accurate ( ideal , strong ) , the meter destroys the interference between the paths , which can be now equipped with probabilities ( squared of the moduli of the corresponding amplitudes ) , and become `` real '' .",
    "each time the experiment is repeated , the pointer points at one of the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath1 , whose mean value is then calculated using the relative frequencies of these occurrences .",
    "the probability to end up in @xmath2 is not what it would be , had the meter not perturbed the system s evolution .",
    "more controversial is the opposite limit , where the intermediate measurement is made inaccurate ( weak ) , in order to avoid the said perturbation .",
    "the weakness of the measurement inevitably causes the meter s readings to be spread , covering the whole real axis in the limit when the perturbation is sent to zero @xcite .",
    "this gives an operational meaning to the uncertainty principle , which states that the value of @xmath1 in a superposition of its eigenstates must be _",
    "indeterminate_. indeed , trying to measure it without destroying the superposition would yield any value at all .    much of the controversy resides , however , in the description of the mean of a weak meter s publication of @xcite , it gave rise a number of intriguing concepts .",
    "these include `` negative kinetic energy '' @xcite , `` negative number of particles '' @xcite , `` having one particle in several places simultaneously '' @xcite , `` photons disembodied from its polarisation '' @xcite , `` electrons with disembodied charge and mass '' @xcite , and `` an atom with the internal energy disembodied form the mass '' @xcite , all supported by the `` evidence '' of weak measurements .",
    "recently we have shown @xcite that the above statements amount to over - interpretations , easily dismissed once the weak values are identified with the transition amplitudes on the paths connecting the initial and final states , and are not seen as the values of the measured quantities . in this paper",
    "we will continue to look at the problem of consecutive quantum measurements , and the classical statistical ensembles produced whenever a meter , or meters , interact with the observed quantum system .",
    "we will pay special attention to the importance of the quantum uncertainty principle , and emphasise the role quantum interference plays in the loss of information about the system s past . throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the simplest case of a two - level system as an example , and refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite -@xcite for a more general analysis .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we compare two of the best known formulations of the uncertainty principle . in sect .",
    "iii we briefly describe the work of a von neumann meter . in section",
    "iv we introduce a simple classical toy model , to be compared with its quantum counterparts later .",
    "section v returns to the simplest quantum network produced by a vn measurement of a quantity , with pre- and post - selection . in section",
    "vi we use our approach to describe a measurement of the difference of two physical quantities , in such a way that the values themselves remain indeterminate .",
    "section vii sets the rules for combining virtual paths .",
    "accurate ( strong ) , and inaccurate ( weak ) limits of the measurements are analysed in sections viii and ix , respectively . in sect .",
    "x the uncertainty principle is used to explain the properties of the weak values .",
    "common misconceptions related with the issue are discussed in sect .",
    "section xii contains our conclusions .",
    "there are several formulations of the uncertainty principle ( up ) covering various aspects of the problem ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps best known is the one relating the respective standard deviations , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , of two variables , represented by non - commuting operators @xmath1 and @xmath6 , measured in the same state .",
    "the so - called robertson s uncertainty relation @xcite reads @xmath7\\ra|}{2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9\\equiv \\hat{a}\\hat{b}-\\hat{b}\\hat{a}$ ] is the commutator , and the angular brackets indicate averaging in the pure state @xmath10 the system is supposed to be in , @xmath11 . equation ( [ q1 ] ) is often interpreted as an indication of the fact that a measurement of @xmath12 must disturb a measurement of @xmath13 , and vice versa .",
    "a somewhat different approach to the up can be found in @xcite , where one reads : _ any determination of the alternative taken by a process capable of following more that one alternative destroys the interference between alternatives_. this principle is complemented by the rule for assigning probabilities to alternative scenarios @xcite : _ when an event can occur in several alternative ways , the probability amplitude for the event is the sum of the probability amplitudes for each way considered separately . if an experiment is performed which is capable of determining when one or another alternative is actually taken , the probability of the event is the sum of the probabilities of each alternative_.    from the above statements , to which we will refer as the `` feynman s uncertainty principle '' , one may conclude that interfering alternatives can not be told apart and must , therefore , form a single indivisible pathway @xcite .",
    "another corollary to the principle is that interference must be destroyed by a physical agent , e.g. , a meter coupled to the observed system .",
    "thus , construction of probabilities by means of squaring the moduli of the corresponding amplitudes , pre - supposes the existence of a suitable meter , as well as the fact that the meter has already been deployed @xcite .",
    "it is the feynman s up to which we will appeal in what follows . despite the obvious difference between the formulations ,",
    "the feynman s principle is not all that different from the up expressed by eq.([q1 ] ) .",
    "consider , for example , a system with a zero hamiltonian , @xmath14 , prepared at @xmath15 in a state @xmath0 .",
    "an accurate measurement of @xmath6 at @xmath16 yields an eigenvalue @xmath17 with the probability @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the corresponding eigenstate .",
    "suppose we also want to learn something about the value of @xmath1 at @xmath20 .",
    "the system must be , in some sense , in one of the eigenstates of @xmath1 .",
    "to see in what sense , precisely , we insert the unity @xmath21 into the amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "the result is @xmath23 .",
    "there are now different ways ( paths , pathways , routes ) to reach the final state by `` passing through a state @xmath24 . without a meter ,",
    "we can not determine which of them is actually taken .",
    "thus , despite the abundance of virtual paths , there is only a single ' ' real `` one , ' ' travelled \" with the probability @xmath25 . if , on the other hand , we employ a meter , capable of telling us which of the eigenvalues @xmath26 has occurred at @xmath20 , the virtual paths will become real , with the @xmath27-th path travelled with the probability @xmath28 .",
    "we also find that the measurement of @xmath1 has disturbed the result of measuring @xmath6 , since @xmath29 quantifying the disturbance would lead to estimates similar to ( [ q1 ] )",
    ". we will not follow this matter any further , and in the next section discuss possible realisation of quantum measurements .",
    "in the following we will often refer to von neumann ( vn ) measurements @xcite , whose definition we will revisit in this section .",
    "a vn meter , designed to measure a variable @xmath1 of a system governed by a hamiltonian @xmath30 , consists of a pointer ( e.g. , a massive particle on a line ) whose position is @xmath31 , and which is coupled to the observed system via ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 if the value of @xmath1 is measured at some @xmath34 , the function @xmath35 is chosen to be @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dirac delta .",
    "we will assume that @xmath1 has discrete eigenvalues @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the corresponding eigenstates , @xmath40 .",
    "prior to the interaction , at @xmath15 , the system is described by a state @xmath41 , and the pointer is in the state @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 is a real function ( e.g. , a gaussian ) , peaked around @xmath44 , and rapidly tending to zero as @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "immediately after the interaction has taken place , the pointer becomes entangled with the system , and their wave function is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47\\psi\\ra$ ] we assume further that the final position of the pointer can be determined precisely , leaving out the fundamental question of how exactly this is done , and whether a collapse of the wave function has occurred @xcite .",
    "in one way or another , after the interaction has taken place , we may `` look '' at the pointer , and find a meter s reading @xmath31 .",
    "perhaps the best known practical realisation of a vn measurement is the stern - gerlach apparatus ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "other vn meters can be constructed by using the spin - orbit interaction @xcite- @xcite , or bose - einstein condensates trapped in double - well potentials @xcite . if nothing else is done to the system , the probability ( density ) to find a reading @xmath48 is ( @xmath49 $ ] stands for the trace of the operator inside the brackets ) @xmath50= \\sum_i |c_i(t_0)|^2g^2(\\xi_0-a_i),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51|\\psi(t+0)\\ra$ ] .",
    "alternatively , at some @xmath52 we may try to find ( post - select ) the system in some state @xmath2 , and keep the meter s readings only if the post - selection is successful .",
    "with this additional condition the probability to find a reading @xmath48 becomes @xmath53=\\n   |\\sum_i \\la \\phi |\\exp[-i\\hat{h}(t - t_0)]|i\\ra g(\\xi_0-a_i)\\la i|\\exp(-i\\hat{h}t_0)|\\psi\\ra|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , apart from the preparation ( pre - selection ) of the system in a state @xmath0 , two other events have occurred : the pointer was found pointing at @xmath48 , and the system was later found in a final state @xmath2 .",
    "quantum mechanics provides the probabilities of such occurrences by means of expressions similar to eqs.([n3 ] ) and ( [ n4 ] ) .",
    "we can imagine , for example , performing more measurements between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , thus creating a network of scenarios , each of which would occur with certain frequency if the experiment is repeated many times . before discussing such `` quantum '' networks , we briefly turn to their classical counterparts .",
    "we start with a simple toy model which , we hope , will be helpful for the discussion of the following sections .",
    "suppose one has at his / her disposal a kit containing purely classical elements , little balls , tubes and connectors , which can be joined together .",
    "a connector @xmath54 has two entrances , and @xmath55 is the probability to enter via the inlet @xmath56 , and subsequently leave via the outlet @xmath57 .",
    "if one of the outlets is blocked , the probability to exit via the remaining one is unity for both entrances . connecting the elements as shown in fig . 1",
    ", one can `` engineer '' a network of paths , which a ball inserted at the top will travel at random , until ending up in one of the final states @xmath58 and @xmath59 . ascribing variables ( numbers ) @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 to each of the connectors , one can also associate numbers , ( functionals ) with each path .",
    "for example , in fig.1a there are eight paths @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "four of them end in the final state @xmath58 ,    @xmath66 : @xmath67 , travelled with the probability @xmath68=w_{b_1}(1|1)w_{a_1}(1|1)w_{in}(1|1)$ ] ,    @xmath69 : @xmath70 , travelled with the probability @xmath71=w_{b_1}(1|2)w_{a_2}(2|1)w_{in}(2|1)$ ] ,    @xmath72 : @xmath73 , travelled with the probability @xmath74=w_{b_2}(2|2)w_{a_1}(2|1)w_{in}(1|1)$ ] ,    @xmath75 : @xmath76 , travelled with the probability @xmath77=w_{b_2}(2|1)w_{a_2}(1|1)w_{in}(2|1)$ ] , and another four , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , end in @xmath59 .",
    "it is always possible to consider sub - networks containing only few paths , regardless of what is happening at later times , or elsewhere in the diagram .",
    "for example , we may limit our attention only to the cases where the ball goes to @xmath62 . as a result of this `` post - selection ''",
    "there are only two paths : @xmath66 , through @xmath80 and @xmath69 , through @xmath81 , travelled with probabilities @xmath68=w_{a_1}(1|1)w_{in}(1|1)$ ] and @xmath71=w_{a_1}(2|2)w_{in}(2|1)$ ] , respectively .",
    "there is a single random variable , a functional @xmath82 $ ] taking the values @xmath38 , @xmath83 , and whose mean value , evaluated over many runs by counting the times the ball passes through @xmath60 and @xmath61 , is @xmath84f[1]+p[2]f[2]\\}/\\ { p[1]+p[2]\\}$ ] .",
    "alternatively , we may focus only on those cases where the ball ends up in @xmath58 , and ask for the difference between the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 , which is recorded for each run .",
    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "now the said difference is a functional @xmath90 $ ] defined on the four paths introduced above , and taking the values @xmath91=f_2[4]=0 $ ] , @xmath92=-2 $ ] and @xmath93=2 $ ] . since two of the values of @xmath94",
    "are the same , we can reduce the number of paths by one , by combining @xmath66 and @xmath75 into a single pathway , @xmath95 , travelled with a probability @xmath96=p[1]+p[4]$ ] , and on which @xmath97 $ ] is understood to be zero .",
    "the resulting equivalent system is shown in fig.1b , and for @xmath98 , evaluated by writing down the value of @xmath94 for each run of the ball , adding up the results , and dividing by the number of runs , we find @xmath99f[1]+p[3]f[2]}{p[1 + 4]+p[2]+p[3]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have invoked the simple toy model in fig.1 in order to emphasise its resemblances to and differences from the quantum case outlined at the end of previous section .",
    "as in the classical case , a set of vn measurements creates sequences of events occurring with certain probabilities , which can be seen as classical pathways `` travelled '' with certain frequencies , if the the experiment is repeated many times . the quantum origin of the experiment becomes evident in the way the probabilities of the events are calculated , as well as in the nature of these events .",
    "a meter recombines and divides the system s virtual paths , endowed with probability amplitudes only , thereby producing `` real '' ones , to which probabilities can be assigned . in particular , two interfering paths are combined into a single one in a much stronger sense , than in the classical case .",
    "for example , in fig.1b the paths @xmath66 and @xmath75 are combined into @xmath95 , since we chose to be interested only in the difference @xmath85 of @xmath38 , and not in their actual values .",
    "we will show that in the quantum case , these actual values may not even exist .",
    "finally , in the classical case , it is understood that two different setups built from the elements of the same kit can be completely different , and need not share any statistical properties . in the quantum case",
    "this is less clear , and we will return to the problem of `` contextuality '' later .",
    "as the first example , we consider a vn measurement of an operator @xmath100 , for a two - level system , pre- and post - selected in the states @xmath0 and @xmath2 , at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . for simplicity we put the system s hamiltonian to zero , @xmath14 , so that nothing happens between @xmath15 and @xmath34 , as well as between @xmath34 and @xmath16 .",
    "our purpose is to show that this creates a classical statistical ensemble not too dissimilar from the one built from the classical elements in the previous section . to see how this is done , we consider the two _ virtual _ paths connecting @xmath0 and @xmath2 , @xmath64 , @xmath83 .",
    "these are    @xmath66 : @xmath101 , with an amplitude @xmath102=\\la \\phi |1\\ra\\la1|\\psi\\ra$ ] , and    @xmath69 : @xmath103 , with an amplitude @xmath104=\\la \\phi |2\\ra\\la 2|\\psi\\ra$ ] .",
    "we also have @xmath105=\\la \\phi|\\psi\\ra$ ] .",
    "the value of @xmath1 at @xmath106 is a functional @xmath107 $ ] defined on the two paths and , obviously , taking the values @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xmath108=a_1,\\q \\text{and } \\q f[2]=a_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without a meter , we may define an _ amplitude distribution _",

    "we have created a continuum of _ real _ paths , all labelled by @xmath31 .",
    "these connect the three observed events , @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath117 @xmath119 , assuming the meter is read before the post - selection is performed .",
    "the range of possible scenarios is determined by the width of the initial pointer s state @xmath120 in eq.([n1a ] ) , which also determines the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "for example , if @xmath120 is chosen to be @xmath121 the possible values of @xmath31 would lie inside the the interval @xmath122 $ ] , assuming @xmath123 . the path labelled @xmath31 is travelled with a probability ( density ) @xmath124 . far from passively observing the motion of the system ,",
    "a meter actively participates in shaping the observed statistical ensemble .",
    "accordingly , the probabilities in eq.([y5 ] ) contain both the amplitudes @xmath125 $ ] , which characterise the unobserved system , and the meter s",
    "own @xmath120 . in the general case",
    "we may learn little about the the quantity of interest , @xmath1 . instead of extracting its value",
    ", we can only conclude that if the meter reading is @xmath48 , the system s state after interaction with the meter was @xcite @xmath126 for which the precise value of @xmath1 remains indeterminate .",
    "it is , however , possible to say that the measurement `` drives '' the system through a state @xmath127 , with a probability @xmath128 . to see that this is , indeed , the case , we could make an accurate measurement of the projector onto @xmath129 just after @xmath130 .",
    "repeating the procedure many times will show that whenever the reading of the first meter lies in a narrow interval around @xmath48 , the additional projection will also succeed .",
    "thus , while every attempt to measure @xmath1 leads to a particular stochastic network , not every measurement allows us to determine the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we will return to the question of the accuracy shortly after considering yet another example .",
    "suppose that , as in previous section , we have a two - level system pre- and post - selected in the states @xmath0 and @xmath2 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "now we want to learn something about the difference of the quantities represented by operators @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which may or may not commute , at @xmath133 and @xmath134 , such that @xmath135 .",
    "[ classically , we could consider , for example , the @xmath54-and @xmath136-components of the momentum , and ask for @xmath137 .",
    "quantally , there is more than one way to approach this task .",
    "\\(i ) we could employ two vn meters , set to measure @xmath1 and @xmath6 separately , and evaluate the difference of their readings .",
    "\\(ii ) we could also construct a hermitian operator formally representing the difference of interest , @xmath138 \\hat{b}\\exp[i\\hat{h}(t_2-t_1)]-\\hat{a}$ ] , and use a single vn meter to measure it at @xmath133 . as discussed in @xcite , a classical analog of this procedure",
    "is a predictive measurement , which uses the fact that knowing the system s coordinates and momenta at @xmath133 allows one to restore the system s subsequent trajectory and , with it , all future values of all quantities .",
    "\\(iii ) a procedure unique to quantum mechanics allows one to evaluate the difference of interest , leaving the actual values of @xmath1 and @xmath6 indeterminate . in general , all three methods give different results @xcite , and here we are only interested in the option ( iii ) . with this in mind , we couple a vn pointer ( position @xmath31 ) , to @xmath1 and @xmath6 at @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , so that the interaction with the meter is given by @xmath139,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the pointer s initial state , @xmath120 has , as before , a gaussian shape , centred at @xmath44 .",
    "the measurement works as follows : after the first coupling the pointer is shifted by one of the eigenvalues of @xmath1 , and after the second one by an eigenvalue of @xmath6 , albeit in the opposite sense .",
    "the resulting shift is , thus , the difference of the two values .",
    "this is not exactly the scheme used by von neumann @xcite , and we will call this meter von neuman - like @xcite . without a meter",
    "there are four virtual paths , @xmath64 , @xmath140 , which connect @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and pass through different intermediate states .",

    "this can only happen in the limit ( [ v1 ] ) , when @xmath120 is made very broad .",
    "one immediate consequence of taking the limit ( [ v1 ] ) is that the range of possible meter s readings has widened to occupy the whole real axis , @xmath205 this gives an operational meaning to the word `` indeterminate '' we have often used above .",
    "if one wishes to keep interference between paths intact , he / she _ must _ choose the meter so inaccurate , that its reading will be arbitrary , leaving the researcher completely ignorant of the value of the functional in question .",

    "it is the uncertainty principle that makes the question meaningless , and any other kind of answer would lead to a conflict with the principle .",
    "fully aware of the randomness of an individual inaccurate result , the authors of @xcite focused on the meter s average reading which , given the same initial an final states , is a uniquely defined quantity , which should come up the same in every long series of trials .",
    "this is given by the real part ( or the imaginary part , if a slightly different meter is used @xcite,@xcite ) of what looks like an average ( [ w5 ] ) , but obtained with a complex valued distribution , constructed from the path amplitudes @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "we wish examine its meaning , bearing in mind the restrictions imposed by the up .",
    "firstly , it should be remembered that eq.([v5 ] ) _ expresses _ the average @xmath206 _ defined _ in a standard way by eq.([x6 ] ) , in terms of terms of the systems amplitudes @xmath219 $ ] .",
    "secondly , as discussed in sect.viii , mean pointer reading in an accurate measurement of a projector yields the relative frequency with which the real path in question is travelled .",
    "thus with @xmath220 trials performed , @xmath221 gives the number of trials in which the system has chosen the path .",
    "the result makes sense , since @xmath213\\ge 0 $ ] , and @xmath222 .",

    "weak measurements measure probability amplitudes . a certain amount of confusion , which led to a plethora of recent publications on this still fashionable subject ( for a recent review see @xcite and refs .",

    "@xcite where the weak values , defined in @xcite as _ \" ... complex numbers that one can assign to the powers of a quantum observable operator @xmath1 using two states , an initial state @xmath39 called _ the preparation _ or _ preselection , _ and a final state @xmath238 called the _ postselection `` , were first introduced .",
    "the authors of @xcite considered a weak measurement of the @xmath229-component of a spin-1/2 , similar to that described in sect.v , and concluded that _ ``",

    "the last shred of mystery , if there was one , disappears when we recall that the perturbation theory typically gives information about both the moduli and the phases of amplitudes and wave function , and the wm scheme is the rule rather than the exception @xcite .",
    "finally a much criticised @xcite , @xcite paper entitled ' ' how the result of a single coin toss can turn out to be 100 heads `` @xcite , the authors argue that _ `` weak values are not inherently quantum but rather a purely statistical feature of pre- and postselection with disturbance''_. without going into the details of the author s reasoning , or into the arguments of their critics , one sees that the claim of @xcite must be wrong . to obtain a mean value which lies outside the region of support of a distribution ,",
    "the distribution must change sign @xcite .",
    "such distributions naturally appear in quantum mechanics , whose basic building blocks are complex valued probability amplitudes @xcite .",
    "they may not , however , appear in a classical theory where all physically meaningful averages are taken with non - negative probabilities .",
    "the parallel between the titles of @xcite , and the ref.@xcite , which followed it twenty six years on , is not coincidental .",
    "the fallacy of weak classical values in @xcite stems naturally from the suggestion @xcite that the combinations of the transitions amplitudes , which arise when a measurement is extremely inaccurate , amount to a ' ' new concept \" of a quantum variable , capable of shedding light on a new physical reality .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the application of a sequence of quantum measurements creates a stochastic network .",
    "a network is classical in the sense that the probabilities for all observable events have , of course , all the usual properties of probabilities in a classical theory .",
    "a network is quantum in its origin , and the action of a meter , or meters , can be seen as a way of `` engineering '' real scenarios , endowed with probabilities , from the virtual paths of the system , for which only probability amplitudes are available .",
    "a network is conveniently described in terms of functionals , which take numerical values on the virtual paths , and whose values the measurements are set to determine . in the case of von neumann and von neumann - like meters considered here , the real pathways are determined by :    \\(i ) the set of virtual paths available for the system with if no meter is present .",
    "( ii ) the values of the measured functional .",
    "two paths sharing the same value can not be distinguished by the meter(s ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the form and width of the initial state of the pointer , @xmath120 , which determine the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "highly accurate measurements turn all virtual paths , that can be distinguished , into real ones , travelled with the probabilities proportional to the squared moduli of the corresponding probability amplitudes . if a functional whose value is @xmath194 on one of the virtual paths , and @xmath153 on all others , is measured accurately , its mean value yields the relative frequency with which the path is travelled .",
    "if the same functional is measured in a highly inaccurate manner , its mean ( weak ) value coincides with the real ( or imaginary ) part of the relative amplitude , corresponding to the selected path . since there no _ apriori _ restrictions on the values of the relative amplitudes , it is always possible to find a transition in which the result of a weak measurement would be any desired number , large , small , positive or negative .",
    "this is a necessary consequence of the uncertainty principle , and the `` unusual '' weak values lying outside the spectrum of the operator @xmath1 in the example given in sect .",
    "v , are by no means unusual .",
    "many of exotic interpretations of the weak measurements results stem from the failure to identify the weak values with the path amplitudes , or their linear combinations , and are easily dismissed once the problem is reformulated in the language of standard quantum mechanics .",

    "<S> the paths are shaped from the virtual paths of the system , and the corresponding probabilities are determined by the measuring devices employed . if the measurements are highly accurate , the virtual paths become `` real '' , and the mean values of a quantity ( a functional ) is directly related to the frequencies with which the paths are travelled . if the measurements are highly inaccurate , the mean ( weak ) values are expressed in terms of the relative probabilities amplitudes . for pre- and post - selected systems they are bound to take arbitrary values , depending on the chosen transition . </S>",
    "<S> this is a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle , which forbids one to distinguish between interfering alternatives , while leaving the interference between them intact . </S>"
