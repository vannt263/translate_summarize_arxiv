    "<S> we introduce certain moves for classical knot diagrams that for all the very many examples we have tested them on give a _ monotonic complete simplification_. a _ complete simplification _ of a knot diagram @xmath0 is a sequence of moves that transform @xmath0 into a diagram @xmath1 with the minimal possible number of crossings for the isotopy class of the knot represented by @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> this paper describes constructions and experimental results originally due to the second named author , that were formalized , put into context , and generalized in collaboration with the first named author . </S>",
    "<S> no new theorem is proved .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce new combinatorial moves @xmath2 on knot diagrams , together with another move @xmath4 and a variant @xmath5 of @xmath4 , that perform very well in the task of simplifying diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> namely , as we have checked by implementing the moves in  @xcite and applying them to a wealth of examples , the moves are apparently very efficient in carrying out a _ monotonic complete simplification_. here by _ </S>",
    "<S> complete simplification _ of a knot diagram @xmath0 we mean a sequence of moves that transform @xmath0 into a diagram @xmath1 with the minimal possible number of crossings for the isotopy class of the knot represented by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplification is _ monotonic _ if the number of crossings never increases along the sequence .    the moves @xmath2 extend the classical reidemeister moves @xmath3 , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 are aimed at detecting whether a diagram can be viewed as the connected sum of two easier ones . </S>",
    "<S> in practice , the simplification procedure based on the moves @xmath2 only is already quite powerful , since it allows for instance to monotonically untangle most of the known hard diagrams of the unknot . </S>",
    "<S> however the moves @xmath2 only are not sufficient in general , as an example provided to us by the referee shows , but this example is easily dealt with using the move @xmath4 . we do not know whether the use of all the moves @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 allows a monotonic complete simplification of any knot diagram , but if this were the case one would have an algorihtm to compute the crossing number of a knot , and in particular to detect knottedness .    in the history of knot theory </S>",
    "<S> quite some energy has been devoted to the problem of effectively detecting whether or not a knot diagram represents the unknot , and more generally of computing the crossing number of a link starting from an arbitrary diagram representing it . </S>",
    "<S> the point here is that , using only reidemeister moves , one may have to temporarily increase the number of crossings before reducing the link to a minimal crossing diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon occurs both for the unknot and for more general knots and links , as explained below . </S>",
    "<S> many solutions of the unknotting problem , with various degrees of suitability for actual implementation , have been obtained over time , see birman and hirsch  @xcite , galatolo  @xcite , hass - lagarias  @xcite , dynnikov  @xcite ( building on birman and menasco  @xcite and cromwell  @xcite ) , and lackenby  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dynnikov s technique also leads to the solution of other computational problems in link theory ( see also kazantsev  @xcite for a further development ) , but apparently not a method for calculating the crossing number . </S>",
    "<S> the result of lackenby provides an upper bound on the number of reidemeister moves needed to untangle a diagram of the unknot , so it is a fundamental one from a theoretical viewpoint , but it is of impractical use . </S>",
    "<S> see also @xcite for some contributions more focused on algorithmic efficiency .    concerning the crossing number , a vast and deep literature exists on it , </S>",
    "<S> see for instance @xcite and the recent fundamental results of lackenby  @xcite , but no effective algorithm to compute it is available to our knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the achievement of coward and lackenby  @xcite yields a theoretical algorithmic procedure to decide whether two diagrams represent the same link , so in principle it allows one to compute the crossing number in an indirect way , namely by comparing a diagram to _ all _ those having fewer crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the moves introduced in this paper are not proved to actually yield an algorithm to compute the crossing number in general , but in practice they seem to work very effectively . </S>",
    "<S> we mention here that the simplification algorithm based on our moves @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 applies not only to knots but also to multi - component links , but our implementation  @xcite is currently restricted to knots , so we have no evidence of efficiency for links so far .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ z123:section ] </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the three moves @xmath2 that extend the classical reidemeister moves ( see , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) , and we describe an algorithm based on these moves aimed at simplifying link diagrams </S>",
    "<S> . then in section  [ experimental : section ] we describe many experimental applications of our algorithm to famously hard knot diagrams , displaying its remarkable practical performance . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section  [ cmove : section ] we introduce the further moves @xmath4 and @xmath5 , showing that they sometimes make the simplification task much faster , and , more importantly , verifying that in some cases they allow simplifications that the moves @xmath2 only are not capable of realizing .    </S>",
