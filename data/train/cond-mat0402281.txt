    "recent successful observation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of trapped alkali atoms has initiated the intensive study of different novel phenomena . on the theoretical front , numerical simulation based on the time - dependent nonlinear mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp )",
    "equation @xcite is well under control and has provided a satisfactory account of some of these phenomena .    since the detection of bec of @xmath0li atoms with attractive interaction , one problem of extreme interest is the dynamical study of the formation and decay of bec for attractive atomic interaction @xcite . in general a attractive condensate larger than a critical size",

    "the atomic scattering length @xmath2 can be varied over a huge range by adjusting the external magnetic field .",
    "consequently , they changed the sign of the scattering length , thus transforming a repulsive condensate of @xmath1rb atoms into an attractive one which naturally evolves into a collapsing and exploding condensate .",
    "donley et al .",
    "have provided a quantitative estimate of the explosion of this bec by measuring different properties of the exploding condensate .",
    "it has been realized that many features of the experiment by donley _",
    "@xcite can be described by the mean - field gp equation @xcite .",
    "however , we are fully aware that there are features of this experiment which are expected to be beyond mean - field description . among these",
    "are the distribution of number and energy of emitted high - energy ( @xmath3 kelvin ) uncondensed burst atoms reported in the experiment .",
    "although there have been some attempts @xcite to describe the burst atoms using the mean - field gp equation , now there seems to be a consensus that they can not be described adequately and satisfactorily using a mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "the gp equation is supposed to deal with the zero- or very low - energy condensed phase of atoms and has been successfully used to predict the time to collapse , evolution of the collapsing condensate as well as its oscillation @xcite .",
    "however , the gp equation has not been fully tested to study the very low - energy ( @xmath4 nano kelvin ) jet formation @xcite when the collapse is suddenly stopped before completion by jumping the scattering length to zero ( noninteracting atoms ) or positive ( repulsive atoms ) values .",
    "as the jet atoms are very low - energy condensed atoms the mean - field gp equation seems to be suitable for their study and we present such a systematic description in this paper .    in the experiment @xcite the initial scattering length @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) of a repulsive ( @xmath7 ) or noninteracting ( @xmath8 ) condensate is suddenly jumped to the negative value @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) to start the collapse .",

    "it is emphasized that unlike the emitted uncondensed ",
    "hotter \" missing and burst atoms reported in the experiment @xcite the jet atoms form a part of the surviving  colder \" condensate and hence should be describable by the mean - field gp equation .",

    "if the attractive condensate is allowed to collapse for sufficiently long time , the explosion stops eventually and a relatively cold remnant condensate is formed . at that stage",

    "is increased at a fixed @xmath76 ms as in figure 4 ( b ) one gradually passes from a strongly collapsing condensate to a relatively cold remnant , that is from a region of prominent jet formation to a region with less prominent jet . for smaller @xmath107",

    "hence , although an axially symmetric model is enough for a qualitative description of the jet , a full three - dimensional model might be necessary for its complete quantitative description .",
