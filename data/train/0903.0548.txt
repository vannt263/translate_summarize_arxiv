    "communications channels today are vulnerable to eavesdropping or wiretapping due to the open nature of the channel , making the characterization of transmission rates for secure and reliable communication for the physical layer an important issue . in the wireless broadcast medium , the model of the broadcast channel ( bc ) with confidential messages , which was studied by csiszr and k@xmath0rner @xcite ,",
    "is used to study simultaneously secure and reliable communication .",
    "the model in @xcite is a generalization of the characterization of the wiretap channel by wyner @xcite . in @xcite , a common message",
    "is sent to 2 receivers , while a confidential message is sent to one of the receivers and kept secret from the other .",
    "the secrecy level is determined by the equivocation rate , which is the entropy rate of the confidential message conditioned on the channel output at the eavesdropper or wiretapper .",
    "the secrecy capacity region is defined as the set of transmission rates where the legitimate receiver decodes its confidential message while keeping the message secret from the wiretapper .    in more recent studies on the bc with confidential messages , liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the scenario where there are 2 receivers and private messages are sent to each one and kept secret from the unintended receiver , while xu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite looked at the same model in @xcite but with a common message to both receivers .",
    "then , bagherikaram _ et al . _",
    "@xcite addressed the scenario where there are 2 receivers and one wiretapper , with confidential messages sent to the receivers .",
    "there have been recent studies where more than 2 receivers were considered .",
    "the authors in @xcite and ekrem and ulukus in @xcite independently studied the @xmath1-receiver bc with an external wiretapper . in @xcite , the @xmath1-receiver bc with confidential messages sent to each receiver",
    "was studied , while in @xcite , the same scenario was studied with the addition that each receiver also received a common message .",
    "both used the degraded bc . in another work ,",
    "an achievable inner bound for the @xmath1-receiver bc with a common message sent to all receivers and a confidential message sent to each of the receivers to be kept secret from an external wiretapper was derived by kobayashi _",
    "et al . _  in @xcite for general conditions on the receivers and wiretapper s channels .",
    "finally , chia and el gamal in @xcite derived an achievable inner bound for the 3-receiver bc with a common message sent to all receivers and a private message sent to 2 of the receivers to be kept secret from the third .    recently in @xcite@xcite , nair and el gamal introduced the channel model of the 3-receiver bc with degraded message sets . in the general form of this model , a common message @xmath2 is sent to all of the receivers , denoted by the set @xmath3 , and the private messages , @xmath4 , are sent to subsets of receivers @xmath5 .",
    "this model best describes a multimedia broadcasting system , in which the common message @xmath2 may represent the lowest quality transmission , and @xmath6 the next higher quality transmission , and so on . in @xcite@xcite ,",
    "three types of 3-receiver bcs with degraded message sets are studied :    1 .",
    "3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets where @xmath2 is sent to all three receivers , @xmath6 is sent to receivers 1 and 2 , and a second private message @xmath7 is sent to receiver 1 ; 2 .",
    "3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 1 ) where the common message @xmath2 is sent to all three receivers and a private message @xmath6 is sent to the first receiver ; 3 .",
    "3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 2 ) where the common message @xmath2 is sent to all three receivers and a private message @xmath6 sent to receivers 1 and 2 .",
    "while preparing this paper for submission , the authors became aware that nair and el gamal in @xcite used a different coding scheme for their achievability proof compared to their earlier work @xcite , with detailed proofs in @xcite .",
    "the added ingredient is rate splitting .",
    "however , a coding scheme with and without rate splitting is shown to give the same rate region in @xcite . based on this , in this paper , we shall not use rate splitting but base our achievability proof on the one in @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study this model of the 3-receiver bc with degraded message sets of @xcite , @xcite with _ secrecy _ constraints . in particular , we characterize the transmission rates for the three types of 3-receiver bcs with degraded message sets from the model mentioned above where receiver 3 is a wiretapper .",
    "we note that the insights which this model of the 3-receiver bc with degraded message sets might bring are due to it being a more general model than the 2- or 3-receiver degraded bc with secrecy constraints .",
    "we also note that chia and el gamal in @xcite have also studied the 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 2 ) with receiver 3 being a wiretapper , but using a different coding scheme .    for the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets and 2 degraded message sets ( type 1 ) without secrecy constraints , the inner capacity bound in @xcite , @xcite is achievable by superposition coding , marton s achievability technique @xcite and indirect decoding , where the receivers decoding the common message only do so via satellite codewords instead of cloud centers . for the general 3-receiver bc with degraded message sets ,",
    "an outer bound to the capacity region was given in @xcite only for the general 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( types 1 and 2 ) .",
    "for the 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 2 ) , the inner and outer bounds coincide under the condition that first and second receivers are less noisy than the third receiver .    in our earlier work @xcite , we had studied the 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 1 ) , with the third receiver regarded as a wiretapper from which the private message is to be kept secret . in this paper , we consider the more general model of the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets where the third receiver is a wiretapper from which the private messages @xmath6 , @xmath7 are to be kept secret . as the wiretapper in this case also decodes the common message , the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets with the third receiver a wiretapper describes a more general scenario than three types of scenarios : the 2-receiver bcs with an external wiretapper of @xcite , the 2-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets and an external wiretapper , and the 3-receiver degraded bcs with an external wiretapper by the virtue of the general conditions on the receivers .    in our secure coding scheme",
    ", we shall use a combination of the code partitioning of wyner @xcite and double - binning of liu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to show the achievability of an inner bound to the rate - equivocation region for the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets .",
    "error probability analysis and equivocation calculation for the private messages are provided .",
    "the proposed secure coding scheme is shown to be sufficient for providing security for both the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets and the 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 1 ) .",
    "we obtain outer bounds to the rate - equivocation region for the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets for the case where receiver 1 is more capable than the wiretap receiver 3 , a weaker condition than the condition that receiver 3 is a degraded version of receiver 1 or the condition that receiver 1 is less noisy than the wiretap receiver 3 @xcite . by removing the security constraints ,",
    "we further obtain an outer bound to the capacity region for the _ general _ 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets , which is not found in @xcite @xcite .",
    "this is because the condition that receiver 1 is more capable than receiver 3 applies only to the case where we have secrecy constraints .",
    "then , we show that the outer bounds to the rate - equivocation region for the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets reduce to the outer bounds to the rate - equivocation region for the 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 1 ) , if receiver 1 is more capable than the wiretap receiver 3 .",
    "finally , we show that , under the condition that the first and second receivers are less noisy than the third receiver , respectively ( still a more general condition than degradedness @xcite ) , the inner and outer bounds to the rate - equivocation region for the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets reduce to the region for the 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 2 ) .",
    "this rate - equivocation region we obtain is furthermore a special case of the variant of the 3-receiver bc with 2 degraded message sets ( type 2 ) studied in @xcite with a different coding scheme .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ 3rx_bc ]",

    "lastly , we give conclusions in section [ concl ] .",

    "the discrete memoryless bc with 3 receivers has an input random sequence , @xmath17 , and 3 output random sequences at the receivers , denoted respectively by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , all of length @xmath12 , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . the conditional distribution for @xmath12 uses of the channel is given by @xmath26    a @xmath27-code for the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets , as depicted in figure [ f : fig3 dm ] , consists of the following parameters : @xmath28 in particular , we have @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , where the notation `` @xmath32 '' highlights that the decoded messages are estimates , with the error probability @xmath33 in this setup , @xmath34 is the wiretapper , and the secrecy level of the messages sent are as follows :    1 .   for @xmath6 sent to users 1 and 2 , the secrecy level is defined by the equivocation rate @xmath35 ; 2 .   for @xmath7 sent to user 1 , the secrecy level is defined by the equivocation rate @xmath36 ; 3 .",

    "since our achievability scheme is based upon that of @xcite , @xcite , it is natural that the inner bound is the same as that of @xcite , @xcite , but with the addition of the equivocation rates .",

    ", @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , so no secrecy rate is possible .",

    "we see that the equivocation rates for @xmath72 in the inner and outer bounds in theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] match .",

    "hence , our secure scheme results in a loss for @xmath50 ( compared to @xmath75 ) that may be larger than expected .",
    "it is also noted that by removing the secrecy constraints from the outer bound to the rate - equivocation region for the 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets , we can obtain a new outer bound to the capacity region of the _ general _ 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets without secrecy .",

    "since the restriction that receiver @xmath53 is more capable than receiver @xmath34 is only applicable when deriving @xmath50 and @xmath51 as will be shown in section [ outer_gen ] , removing the secrecy constraints will give us the outer bound to the capacity region of the general 3-receiver bc with 3 degraded message sets .",

    "it appears that by sending more messages to receiver @xmath53 , then the achievable equivocation rates can be increased .    the lower achievable rate for @xmath6 sent to @xmath53 for the 2 degraded message sets ( type 1 ) channel is due to the fact that the achievable coding scheme protects all the codewords generated by superposition coding .",
