    "[ defect ] we constructed a ring epimorphism @xmath270 which is an isomorphism in the top dimension @xmath9 and is such that the kernel of @xmath271 coincides with the subgroup @xmath272 which lies in @xmath242 . since @xmath273 we obtain @xmath274 and applying the poincar duality ( note that @xmath21 is a closed orientable manifold without singularities ) we find that @xmath275 for some @xmath276 . since @xmath271 is an epimorphism we may write @xmath277 and we see that @xmath278 since @xmath279 .    from our assumptions @xmath280 and @xmath251 it follows that the sets @xmath110 and @xmath109 are short and then theorem [ thm2 ] implies that there are no balanced classes in the top dimensional cohomology group @xmath281 . since @xmath282",
