    "in addition to combustion , the darrieus - landau instability has been observed in different types of plasmas , from the interstellar medium to inertial confinement fusion , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another system in which combustion - like processes have been observed are crystals of molecular ( nano ) magnets .",

    "a crystal prepared in the metastable magnetic orientation , after local heating to overcome the activation energy , will see a propagation of the spin reversal , as the energy released by the spin flip will propagate to neighboring molecules , in a process dubbed a spin avalanche or magnetic deflagration  @xcite .",
    "the spin reversal can also occur without the activation energy being attained , through spin tunneling  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon leads to the presence , for certain values of the magnetic field strength , of tunneling resonances that greatly increase the speed of propagation of the spin reversal front  @xcite .",
    "in previous work  @xcite , we demonstrated that the propagation of this magnetic deflagration front is unstable , due to the fact that any distortion in the front increases the local magnetic field , creating a positive feedback . in this paper , we take a closer look at the stability of the front , and derive an analytical expression for the instability growth rate , in the limit of an infinitely thin front .",
    "we also study the instability numerically , accounting for a finite magnetic front thickness .",
    "our results are also compared to experimental data  @xcite , taking into account the presence of tunneling resonances .",

    "another important outcome from fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] is that the instability is stronger for relatively weak fields .",

    "the instability is caused by the dipole field created by the crystal magnetization . in our model",

    "perturbations with different @xmath94 have different growth rates , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the perturbation with highest growth rate @xmath73 develops faster and leads to a stationary , curved front ( see the numerical simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the growth rate stands for the characteristic time needed for the instability to develop from a planar front to a stationary , curved front . for a possible observation of the instability , this time should be much smaller than the time of propagation of the magnetic deflagration front within the crystal .",

    "[ fig : cutoff ] , which leads to a decrease of the instability growth rate , since the wavelength of the perturbation can not exceed the width of the sample .",

    "[ fig : smax ] .",
    "second , it decreases the cutoff wavelength and the wavelength at the maximum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] ) , such that the estimated values are within the range of the dimensions of the crystal .",
    "in addition to that , the amplitude of the resonance can be increased significantly by applying a transverse magnetic field , effectively increasing @xmath58 .",
    "if the instability becomes strong enough , acceleration of the deflagration front can create a weak shock wave ahead of the front , which might lead to the deflagration - to - detonation transition  @xcite . in the weak detonation regime , the front propagates at the speed of sound , and such a spin reversal phenomena",
    "has already been observed experimentally near a resonance  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the front instability in magnetic deflagration and found that it behaves in a similar fashion to the darrieus - landau instability in combustion . that is , in the limit of an infinitely thin front , the instability has a positive growth rate at all wavelengths .",
    "the dispersion relation of the growth rate as a function of the instability wave number is also similar to that of the darrieus - landau instability .",
    "the case of a finite - width front was explored numerically , and we found that the instability should be observable in current experimental setup , in particular close to a tunneling resonance , the latter resulting in a smaller value of the wavelength at which the instability will have the highest growth rate .    analysing the effect of the direction of propagation of the front with respect to the easy axis , we showed that the instability would not grow for a perpendicular front .",
    "we suggest two different experimental setups ( a ) and ( b ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : linear_geometry ] .",
    "theory predicts an unstable front in case ( a ) , resulting in a faster propagation of the front as result , and a stable front in case ( b ) . by comparing velocities of the magnetic deflagration of these two different geometries one can verify the presence of the instability .",
    "signatures of the presence of the instability might also explain some previous experimental results .",
    "for instance , for strong longitudinal fields , the velocities recorded in the experiments are higher than the theoretical predictions  @xcite , which could be explained by the effect of the instability on front speed .",
    "( note that while the front would be curved due to the instability , the propagation speed of the curved front will also be steady .",
    "@xcite ) likewise , the front broadening also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite could be explained by the front instability .",

    "<S> the presence of quantum tunneling resonances is shown to increase the growth rate significantly , which may lead to a possible transition from deflagration to detonation regimes . </S>",
    "<S> different orientations of the crystal easy axis are shown to exhibit opposite stability properties . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we suggest experimental conditions that could evidence the instability and its influence on the magnetic deflagration velocity . </S>"
