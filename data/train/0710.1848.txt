    "perhaps the most dramatic way in which bose condensation in the alkali gases differs from its counterpart in @xmath0he ( or , for that matter , in conventional @xmath1-wave superconductors ) is that the condensed particles have non - zero spin  @xcite .",
    "magnetic trapping results in a gas in which the spin state of the atoms can be described using the adiabatic approximation , with the atoms remaining in a particular hyperfine level relative to the local magnetic field as they move around the trap .",
    "although there are several interesting consequences of the non - uniformity of the field  @xcite , far richer behavior results when atoms are optically trapped , allowing the full consequences of rotational invariance to be realized .",
    "the experimental preparation of a long - lived gas in a particular hyperfine multiplet may be more difficult for some atoms than others , but the theorist is nevertheless called upon to answer the question : _ what are the properties of the higher spin bose condensates , and how will they manifest themselves in the ultracold laboratory ? _    starting with refs .",
    "@xcite , a number of investigations have explored the possible magnetic phases of these condensates .",
    "the dynamics of such an ordered phase is generally described by a non - linear equation for the motion of the order parameter on some manifold of symmetry - broken states , but this line of thought has not been much pursued .",
    "this is partly due to the existence of a dynamical description of bose condensates valid in the dilute limit , namely the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which may be straightforwardly extended to the multicomponent case .",
    "a hydrodynamical description of the ` slow ' degrees of freedom  generally the order parameter and any conserved quantities  is nevertheless desirable both for physical transparency and simplicity , at the modest cost of eliminating certain uninteresting high frequency motions .",
    "the goal of this work is to develop and apply such a description for the case of a ferromagnetic condensate .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive the equations of motion valid in the long wavelength limit starting from the gross - pitaevskii lagrangian for a ferromagnetic condensate . after discussing",
    "the conservation laws of the theory the equations of motion are used to study the stability of magnetic helices ( section  [ sec : helix ] ) , larmor precession in the presence of dipolar forces ( section  [ sec : larmor ] ) and spin waves in the presence of larmor averaged dipolar forces ( section  [ sec : ave ] ) .",
    "the relevance of the last calculation to the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite is briefly discussed .",
    "our starting point is the gross - pitaevskii lagrangian density ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a @xmath5 component spinor and @xmath6 the spin-@xmath1 matrices .",
    "the quartic terms are appropriate to the description of interatomic interactions in a spin-1 condensate such as @xmath7rb , where @xmath8 favors ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "the description of higher spin condensates requires more parameters but the phase diagram always includes a ferromagnetic phase  @xcite",
    ".    we are going to work in the low energy limit where both interaction terms are fully satisfied .",
    "this is appropriate to the limit where the condensate wavefunction varies on scales much longer than either the density or spin healing length , or equivalently , the superfluid velocity is small compared to the speed of propagation of sound or spin waves .",
    "this is analogous to the incompressible limit used to describe normal fluids at low local mach number .",
    "the density interactions demand @xmath9 , which we set equal to unity from now on , while the spin interactions , assumed ferromagnetic , demand that the polarization be maximal at each point , so that the spinor @xmath4 is a spin coherent state . assuming that the interactions dominate all other terms in the hamiltonian allows other terms describing e.g. zeeman and dipole - dipole interactions to be included in a controlled way by simply evaluating them on the constrained ferromagnetic manifold . a similar approach to the static case",
    "was introduced in  @xcite .    in this limit the equations of motion for the unit vector @xmath10 describing the local magnetization @xmath11 will be shown to be    @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 denotes the usual eulerian derivative @xmath15",
    ". the first equation is a modified landau - lifshitz equation ( lle ) , that accounts for the advection of the magnetization by the superfluid velocity @xmath16 .",
    "the other two equations determine this flow from the condition of vanishing divergence ( incompressibility ) and the _ mermin - ho relation _  @xcite that fixes the vorticity @xmath17 .",
    "the lines of vorticity coincide with the lines of constant @xmath18 .",
    "( [ v_fix ] ) fix @xmath16 up to a some potential contribution @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this should be chosen so that the normal component of the velocity vanishes at the boundary of the flow .",
    "note that the dynamics of the system depends crucially on the spin @xmath1 , with the usual lle being recovered in the @xmath21 limit .",
    "_ variational principle _ the dynamical equations may be found by a variational principle through an appropriate parametrization of the constraint manifold .",
    "we use the parametrization @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a normalized eigenstate of @xmath24 with eigenvalue @xmath1 .",
    "as expected there is some gauge freedom in how the overall phase of the state is apportioned between @xmath23 and the phase factor @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , the velocity is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "this vector potential depends on the gauge choice , though its curl does not @xmath28 which is just the memin - ho relation .",
    "incompressibility translates to the constraint @xmath29 while the hamiltonian and lagrangian eq .",

    "( [ incomp_con ] ) .",
    "the non - trivial part is finding the variation of the terms involving @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , which depends upon @xmath18 , without introducing a specific parametrization .",
    "this is accomplished by writing the field strength @xmath33 including a fictitious extra coordinate @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 the variational derivative of the action with respect to @xmath31 is just the current @xmath37 , so we have @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where integration by parts has been used to obtain the second term .",
    "the boundary term is equal to zero as @xmath39 vanishes there .",
    "since the current is conserved by the incompressibility condition , the second term drops out and we have our variation .",
    "a final subtlety is that when we vary @xmath40 we also have to take into account the change @xmath41 implied by eq .",
    "( [ incomp_con ] ) @xmath42 this variation is handled in precisely the same way , but now the boundary term is zero due to the vanishing of the normal component of the velocity at the boundary .",
    "together with the variation of the first term of the hamiltonian , the above variation readily gives the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ lle ] ) .",
    "_ conservation laws _ let us start by noting that eq .",
    "( [ lle ] ) can be understood as the conservation equation for the magnetization @xmath43 with the spin current @xmath44 another conservation law follows by first considering the equation of motion for the vorticity @xmath17  @xcite @xmath45    which can be used to check that the _ hydrodynamic impulse _ defined by @xmath46 is a constant of the motion , as it is for both the lle ( where @xmath47 is defined from the mermin - ho relation ) and the euler equation for incompressible flow .",
    "if external forces act on the fluid , they give the rate of change of the impulse .",
    "for the case of rigid walls that we have considered the total momentum @xmath48 of the fluid naturally remains zero , with the reaction force of the walls being transmitted instantaneously to the body of the fluid due to incompressibility  @xcite .",
    "finally we have the topological _ helicity _ invariant @xmath49 which again is known in both hydrodynamics and magnetism  @xcite . for a condensate it is equal to the integer brouwer degree of the map @xmath50 given by @xmath51 for some fiducial state @xmath52 .",
    "topological defects have been sought in the spin-1/2 case , but so far without success  @xcite .",
    "we now apply these equations to the analysis of the stability of helical configurations of the magnetization @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the instabilities of these configurations were studied in the recent experiment ref .  @xcite . since there is only a single wavevector present @xmath55 .",

    "small deviations from the helix are then written as @xmath63 .",

    "( [ gp_l ] ) before taking the incompressible limit @xmath71 .",
    "an extensive analysis of the bogoliubov modes of the helix configurations , not restricted to the incompressible limit , was recently given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the question of the stability of larmor precession .",
    "absent dipolar interactions , rotational symmetry in the spin space means that the only effect of a magnetic field is precession at the larmor frequency @xmath72 .",
    "we will now show that accounting for dipolar forces renders larmor precession unstable in general .",
    "the approximation of averaging the dipolar interactions over the larmor trajectories , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , is therefore guaranteed to break down at sufficiently long times .    the simplest geometry to consider is an infinite plane of thickness @xmath73 .",

    "we may use the above energy as a _ local _ energy density as long as the magnetization varies on sufficiently large scales @xmath84 . as we will see in the next section , in 2d",
    "the long - ranged dipolar interactions have the non - analytic form @xmath85 , so that the leading deviation from this approximation is @xmath86 i.e. _ linear _ in the spin wave wavevector . requiring that this part is small compared to the usual quadratic spin wave dispersion @xmath87 then gives the two conditions @xmath88 .",
    "the equations of motion are then @xmath89 working in the canonical coordinates @xmath90 , @xmath91 , the precession of a spatially constant magnetization @xmath92 obeys the equations @xmath93 which may be solved exactly in terms of elliptic functions . for the case of small angle precession",
    "about the direction of the magnetic field , kittel s classical result for the precession frequency is @xmath94  @xcite .    introducing as before the frenet - serret frame we find the linearized equation of motion for the spin waves ( since the zeroth order solution is constant in space the advection term plays no role )  @xcite @xmath95 where we have used the expression for the torsion @xmath96 , and the equation of motion eq .",

    ". it would therefore be useful to study the same problem in a uniform system at higher temperatures , where such fluctuations may be present to begin with .",
    "we have developed a long wavelength description of ferromagnetic condensates , which considerably simplifies the understanding of dynamical phenomena relative to the time - dependent gp theory .",
