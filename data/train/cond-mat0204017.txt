    "excitation energy transfer ( eet)@xcite is ubiquitous in photo sensitive materials@xcite and is one of the key steps in photosynthesis@xcite . since the seminal works of frster@xcite and dexter ( fd)@xcite , their rate expressions have been confirmed by numerous experiments and have played fundamental roles in understanding various luminescence phenomena@xcite . in these advances ,",
    "the spectral overlap expression of frster@xcite , which allows identification of the reaction rate without any resort to a model hamiltonian , has been essential .",
    "the rate expressions of fd are applications of the fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) , which rely on the smallness of the resonance interactions .",
    "the spectral overlap expression of frster derives from the additional simplification that bath modes coupled to the energy donor and acceptor are independent of each other . if there are _",
    "common _ bath modes@xcite , such a simple expression is not in general valid .",
    "however , within the harmonic oscillator bath model , rigorous extensions of the fd theory can be made@xcite with the use of small polaron transformation , and can be further generalized for the study of long - time dynamics based on the redfield - type equation@xcite and for the understanding of exciton transport in molecular crystals@xcite .",
    "in recent years , theoretical advances to cope with new experiments have been made , such as microscopic consideration of the medium effect@xcite , generalization of the fd rate expression for disordered multichromorphic systems@xcite , and unified theories covering up to the intermediate and strong coupling regimes@xcite .",
    "although often not noticed , the assumption of stationarity is implicit in the fd theory .",
    "the fgr is valid only when the initial density operator commutes with the zeroth order hamiltonian and the bath time scale is much shorter than that of the electronic transition . for eet processes occurring in nanosecond or longer time scale , one may safely assume that the bath modes have already relaxed and become equilibrated with the excited donor before the energy transfer takes place , unless there are ultra - slow modes or spin interactions with comparable time scales .",
    "application of the fgr , thus the fd theory , can be justified for this case . however , eet in general is a nonstationary process where nonequilibrium relaxation of the nuclear degrees of freedom occurs during and after the electronic excitation .",
    "for fast eet processes occurring in a time scale comparable to the bath relaxation time , the reaction kinetics predicted by the fd theory may not be accurate enough .",
    "the importance of the nonequilibrium effects for fast eet was in fact recognized long time ago , and was named as hot transfer@xcite . due to experimental limitations , however , the earlier experiments and relevant theories were concerned with the frequency domain situation where the reaction rate at issue is the stationary long time limit in the presence of an excitation field tuned for the hot transfer@xcite .",
    "time dependent pump - probe situation was considered later by sumi@xcite , who formulated a time dependent generalization of the fd theory based on a nonequilibrium golden rule approximation@xcite .    with the advance of ultrafast spectroscopy ,",
    "it has become possible to induce the electronic excitation in the femtosecond scale .",
    "experiments@xcite performed in this manner reveal systems where the eet rate is comparable to the vibrational relaxation rate of some modes . a typical example for",
    "this is the eet from b800 to b850 in the light harvesting complex 2 ( lh2)@xcite , which is known to occur in about @xmath1 .",
    "evidences for fast eet were found in other systems also such as the conjugated polymer@xcite , dendrimers@xcite , and the photosynthetic reaction center@xcite . in general , the microscopic mechanisms of the eet in these systems are quite complicated , and considerations of multipolar transitions , multichromorphic effects , and disorder may be important .",
    "however , simple comparison of time scales indicates that examination of the nonequilibrium effects can not be overlooked .",
    "the theory of sumi@xcite and recent theories@xcite on intermediate and strong coupling seem suitable for these considerations . however , the nature of the approximation involved in the bath relaxation dynamics , upon which the nonequilibrium kinetics is sensitive , is not clear in these approaches .    in the present work",
    ", we provide a straightforward and rigorous nonequilibrium generalization of the fd theory .",
    "the procedure is to go through the same perturbation theory as in deriving the fgr , but starting from the nonstationary initial states and considering full time dependences .",
    "our analysis is limited to the usual perturbation regime of the fd theory .",
    "we assume that the resonance interaction is small enough to validate second order perturbation theory and that the reaction is virtually irreversible due to either energetic or entropic reason .",
    "however , the excitation bath coupling is treated rigorously .",
    "the present theory is analogous to the nonequilibrium generalization of the electron transfer@xcite , but an important distinction is that we provide a spectral overlap expression valid for arbitrary bath without common modes , a typical situation for the eet .",
    "our theory can be considered as the pump - probe version of the hot transfer rate theories@xcite .",
    "more importantly , our spectral overlap expression brings a connection between the time dependent reaction rate and the modern ultrafast spectroscopy experiment , which allows direct determination of the reaction rate or enables experimental confirmation whether the usual assumption of the eet kinetics is valid .",
    "in addition , we provide calculations of the time dependent rate for the model of the harmonic oscillator bath , which illustrate some features of the nonequilibrium eet kinetics .",
    "the sections are organized as follows . in sec .",
    "iia , we present the main formalism and provide the spectral overlap expression valid for general bath hamiltonian without common modes .",

    "we assume that both chromophores are excited to singlet states and do not consider multiexciton states .",
    "therefore , the three electronic states @xmath4 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 form a complete set of electronic states . all the rest of the dynamic degrees of freedom such as molecular vibrations and solvation coordinates",

    "phonons and vibrations are localized , this assumption seems reasonable .",
    "since we consider the excitation dynamics during a time much shorter than the lifetime of the excited state , we neglect the spontaneous decay channels of the excited states . adopting a second quantization notation where @xmath4 is treated as",

    "the excitation bath coupling is assumed to be as follows : h_eb = b__d a__d^a__d+b__a a__a^a__a [ eq : heb ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are bath operators coupled to @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "these operators and the bath hamiltonian can be arbitrary except for the following condition : = [ h_b_d , b__a]=[h_b_a , b__d]=0 [ eq : nocom2 ] which implies that the bath modes coupled to @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent of each other .",
    "this assumption can be justified if the chromophores @xmath2 and @xmath3 are far enough apart from each other and the major nuclear modes coupled to excitations are localized to either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , which can be consistent with the assumption of smallness of @xmath13 .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "6 . in the zero temperature limit ,",
    "the nonequilibrium effect was not so significant for this weak coupling case .",
    "this fact remains the same even for the higher temperature .",
    "the main focus of the present paper was the nonequilibrium bath relaxation effect .",
    "for this reason , we considered only the simplest case where donor and acceptor each have one excited state .",
    "however , as recent studies on various systems indicate@xcite , the existence of multiple chromophores is a general situation rather than an exception .",
    "therefore , one in general must consider the case where the donor and the acceptor respectively consist of multiple exciton states .",
    "given that the inter - excitonic relaxation can be disregarded or approximated in a self consistent way , the generalization of the present theory can be done straightforwardly as are those of the fd theory@xcite . in many cases ,",
    "this type of simple extension may indeed capture the main aspect of the eet between multichromorphic donor and acceptor .",
    "however , if some of the excitonic levels are closely spaced or if there is degeneracy due to symmetry , more careful theoretical analysis is necessary .    in a heterogeneous environment or a complex system",
    ", disorder plays an important role and its explicit consideration becomes necessary for a proper understanding of the system . due to the averaging over the static disorder involved in this case , our spectral overlap expression can not be used directly for the observables of an ensemble experiment . however , given that the distribution of the static disorder is well characterized by other means , monte carlo simulation can provide an indirect way of determining the nonequilibrium population transfer .",
    "the study of the interplay between the heterogeneity and the nonequilibrium effect in this way can bring new insights into the fast eet kinetics of complex systems .    in the lh2 of purple bacteria , the eet from b800",
    "to b850 occurs in about @xmath99 and the rate is not so sensitive to temperature@xcite .",
    "this rate is much faster than that obtained by the fd theory , but it has recently been shown that consideration of the multichromorphic nature of the b850 and the disorder account for much of the discrepancy@xcite . however , the theoretical value is still somewhat smaller than the experimental one@xcite .",
    "many explanations are possible for this , and the nonequilibrium effect is one such possibility .    according to our model calculations , the nonequilibrium short time kinetics shows complicated time dependent behavior and the reaction rate in this regime is less dependent on the spectral overlap between the stationary emission and absorption profiles .",
    "some of these features can be seen in recent sub - picosecond pump - probe experiments@xcite .",
    "for example , the reaction rate is shown to be relatively insensitive to the change of the spectral profile for the eet in the photosynthetic reaction center@xcite .    before applying the present theory to a given system ,",
    "it is always important to examine whether the nature of the system is consistent with the assumption of irreversibility and the use of second order approximation .",
    "it is expected that our results can be applied as long as @xmath55 is sufficiently large and the bath relaxation of the acceptor is fast enough . however , in order to address these issues more systematically , it is necessary to formulate a theory that can account for electronic coherence . for this purpose",
    ", one may adopt the formalism of the generalized master equation@xcite or consider in the framework of the redfield - type equation@xcite .",
