    "an efficient way to study the relation between string theory and standard model ( sm ) field theory is through the _ bottom - up _",
    "approach @xcite which constitutes an alternative to the traditional _ top - down _ approach . in",
    "the latter one starts from a string theory and tries to reproduce the sm massless spectrum by a suitable calabi - yau manifold compactification that reduces the number of space - time dimensions and supersymmetry , giving the right gauge group . in the former , instead , one looks for configurations of d - branes with world - volume gauge theories similar as much as possible to the sm .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that it does not require any knowledge of the geometrical details of the manifold compactification .",
    "we would like here to observe that the bottom - up approach is essentially based on the property that a d - brane supports a gauge field theory on its world - volume . on the other hand",
    "it is well - known that d - branes can be studied from a complementary point of view : they are classical solutions of the ten - dimensional supergravity .",
    "this is the essence of the _ gauge / gravity _ correspondence .",
    "it means that one can analyze the classical backgrounds generated by a particular configuration of d - branes to get some insight on the _ dual _ gauge theories living on their world - volume and viceversa .",
    "this is just the point of view we want to adopt in this paper that can represent a sort of link between the bottom - up approach and the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "we study the latter by considering a suitable configuration of fractional branes yielding the sm - like gauge theory .",
    "fractional branes , living at orbifold singularities , are interesting tools to study gauge / gravity correspondence for non conformal gauge theories with reduced supersymmetry in different renormalization schemes @xcite .",
    "this aim would be better achieved , for @xmath1 theories , by considering branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles inside a calabi - yau space .",
    "in fact it has been shown that the classical supergravity solutions determined by these non perturbative objects are completely regular @xcite and therefore they allow to study also the infrared properties of the dual gauge theories .",
    "unfortunately , within this approach , it is not straightforward to find a classical background dual to gauge theory with chiral matter , which is instead more easily deducible from bound states of fractional branes .",
    "we expect , in analogy with similar configurations , that the classical background determined by fractional branes @xcite contains a naked singularity resolved by the _ enhanon _ mechanism .",
    "the enhanon is a sort of screen which excises the region of space - time corresponding to scales where non - perturbative effects become relevant in the gauge theory and this clarifies why we are able to obtain only the ultraviolet behavior of the field theory .    in this paper",
    "we consider a stack of fractional d3-d7 branes living on the orbifold @xmath6 .",
    "the choice of such an orbifold is motivated by the interest in @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theories with matter .",
    "in fact this is one of the simplest orbifolds preserving four supersymmetry charges .",
    "furthermore in this orbifold background there are four different kinds of fractional d - branes corresponding to the four irreducible representations of the abelian discrete group @xmath7 .",
    "the gauge theory supported by a general bound state of @xmath8 fractional branes of type @xmath9 is a @xmath10 gauge theory with chiral multiplets charged under the bifundamental representations of the gauge group .",
    "the inclusion of fractional d7-branes , since the open strings have one end on a d3-brane and the other end on a d7 , allows us to have chiral multiplets charged only under the fundamental representation of the gauge group .",
    "they have also a flavor index running on the number of fractional d7-branes .",
    "it is relevant to note that when we turn off three of the gauge groups by choosing @xmath11 the gauge theory ( in the presence of the d7-brane ) is exactly @xmath1 super qcd with matter .    in the forthcoming discussion we will consider a bound state of a d3-brane living at the orbifold singularities and hence it is completely localized in the world - volume of the d7-brane .",
    "the latter is partially extended along the orbifold directions . for our purposes",
    "it has been enough to compute the asymptotic behavior of the classical supergravity solution via the boundary state formalism .",
    "the solution so found exhibits a @xmath12 isometry acting as a phase factor on the coordinates transverse to the d3 branes .",
    "such an invariance is related to the classical @xmath13 r - symmetry of the dual gauge theory @xcite . in a gauge theory",
    "this symmetry is just a member of a supersymmetric multiplet containing also the dilations . in classical theories , which are invariant under superconformal transformations ,",
    "the corresponding currents are conserved .",
    "quantum corrections break superconformal invariance and give rise to anomalies .",
    "the anomaly breaking of the global @xmath14 symmetry appears as a spontaneous symmetry breaking in supergravity @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the @xmath15 is not the final anomaly free @xmath16 which is obtained via a suitable choice of the r - charges of the various fields .",
    "we have found that also our classical solution explicitly breaks the @xmath12 isometry to one of its discrete subgroups .",
    "therefore we expect to obtain the associated anomaly of the underlying gauge theory .",
    "in fact , by analyzing on the supergravity side how the solution transforms under a combined scale and chiral transformation , we have been able to reproduce the corresponding anomalies , i.e. the one - loop @xmath17-function and its chiral anomaly .",
    "it is evident that we have used supergravity to get perturbative information on the dual gauge theory .",
    "this means that our correspondence has to be interpreted not in the same spirit as ads / cft , but more properly in that of open / closed string duality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sect .",
    "2 we analyze the properties of fractional d3-branes on the orbifold @xmath18 and in particular we study how the orbifold acts on the open strings stretched between two of these branes .",
    "this analysis allows us to obtain the massless spectrum of the gauge theory surviving the orbifold projection .",
    "furthermore we introduce fractional d7-branes , determine the massless spectrum of the matter chiral fields and fix a configuration of d7-branes that leads to an anomaly free gauge theory .    in sect .",
    "3 we analyze , from the point of view of the boundary state approach , the boundary action of our system .",
    "in particular , by writing the boundary states of a fractional d7-brane and by computing the coupling of this boundary with the bulk fields , we construct , at linearized level , the boundary action for such a brane in this orbifold .",
    "furthermore , still within the boundary state formalism , we also compute the classical solution of the equations of motion at first order in the string coupling @xmath19 . in the last part of this section",
    "we investigate the stability of the system related to the one - loop massless tadpole cancellation .    finally in sect .",
    "4 , by studying how the scale and chiral transformations of the dual gauge theory are realized in supergravity , we are able to compute the corresponding anomalies .",
    "the one - loop @xmath17-function and the chiral anomalies emerge out from the asymptotic classical profile of the bulk fields .",
    "let us consider a system of d3 and d7-branes of type iib string theory on the orbifold @xmath21 .",

    "the spectrum of the closed string theory on the orbifold space @xmath37 consists of an untwisted sector , corresponding to the identity of the orbifold group and three twisted sectors corresponding to its non trivial elements .",
    "in particular , the massless spectrum in the twisted sectors coincides with the zero modes of supergravity fields dimensionally reduced on the three exceptional vanishing two - cycles @xmath38 with @xmath39 characterizing the orbifold , each of them embedded in one of the three four - dimensional subspaces of @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the dual in the four - dimensional space in which the two - cycle is embedded .    in",
    "the following we are interested in describing fractional branes coupled to two kinds of twisted scalars and twisted rr four - form .",
    "the scalars are obtained by reducing the kalb - ramond two - form @xmath45 and the rr two - form on the exceptional two - cycles , while the rr four - form is obtained by reducing the rr six - form , i.e. : @xmath46      let us introduce now fractional d3-branes on this orbifold .",
    "in particular we are interested in studying configurations where these branes are transverse to the orbifold , namely with world - volume directions @xmath48 with @xmath49 .    before the orbifold projection , the low energy modes consistent with the open superstring theory living on the @xmath50 @xmath51-branes , are those of the four dimensional @xmath52 @xmath53 super yang mills theory .",
    "in fact a generic open string state is the product of a chan - paton factor , that is in this case an @xmath54 matrix , and of an oscillator part .",
    "in particular , in the neveu - schwarz sector , the massless states are given by : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the chan - paton factor and @xmath39 .    the states @xmath57 can be identified with the @xmath53 gauge bosons of the supersymmetric @xmath52 gauge theory ; the three complex fields @xmath58 describe the six real scalars living , as @xmath57 , in the adjoint representation of the @xmath53 gauge group .",
    "all of them fill the bosonic part of the @xmath52 gauge multiplet .",
    "the same analysis can be repeated for the ramond sector . in this case",
    "the massless spectrum is identified with the four two - component ( on shell ) fermions still in the adjoint representation of @xmath53 .",
    "let us now consider the spectrum in the orbifold theory , taking into account that the orbifold group acts both on the oscillators and on the chan - paton factors .",
    "the only allowed states are the ones surviving under this combined action .",
    "we would like here to remind that the action of the orbifold group element @xmath59 on the chan - paton factors is defined as : @xmath60 in the case of @xmath7 , @xmath59 runs over the four elements of this group defined in ( [ group ] ) .",
    "we are interested in _ fractional _ branes which are defined as d - branes whose chan - paton factors transform under the irreducible representations of the orbifold group .",
    "@xmath61 has four one - dimensional irreducible representations : @xmath62 the above definition implies that fractional branes , differently from the regular ones , do not admit images and hence they live at the orbifold fixed point @xmath63 .",
