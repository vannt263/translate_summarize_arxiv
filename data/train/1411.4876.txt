    "the discovery of a boson with a mass of approximately @xmath0 gev was announced in july 2012 by the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern @xcite .",
    "this discovery is compatible with previous data from proton - antiproton collisions at @xmath1 tev at the tevatron @xcite . using all of the available data , with a total luminosity of 25 @xmath2 from the proton - proton collisions with energies of @xmath3 and 8 tev runs at the lhc",
    ", properties of the higgs boson properties , such as spin , parity , mass , and the couplings to other standard model ( sm ) particles , has been further investigated @xcite .",
    "so far , however , there are no indications of major deviations from the properties of the sm higgs boson , and the boson does in fact seem to be a cp even scalar @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson marks an important milestone in the history of particle physics , especially for our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of particle masses @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson was discovered through its decays into gauge bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 pairs . however , using the full set of data from the lhc , there is now also evidence for decays into fermions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "even though the properties of the new boson so far are compatible with those of the sm higgs , the possibility for new physics in the higgs sector should be investigated .",
    "new physics can manifest itself in different ways , some of which can be detected since they would give rise to a rescaling of the magnitude , or change in the structure , of the higgs boson couplings .",
    "hence , a natural step forward in experimental higgs physics is precision measurements of the higgs boson couplings to fermions and gauge bosons . from existing data ,",
    "there are bounds on the couplings of the boson .",
    "however , hadron colliders are in general not ideal for higgs precision measurements and thus , in order to determine the couplings with significantly greater precision , the upgrade of the lhc to 14 tev wo nt suffice and instead lepton colliders , such as a higgs factory , are needed @xcite",
    ".    the status of the higgs couplings as measured by the lhc can be studied by means of so - called _ higgs coupling scale factors _ , introduced by the lhc higgs cross section working group as an interim treatment of the higgs couplings @xcite .",
    "coupling scale factors are introduced in order to rescale the magnitudes of the higgs production and decay rates , which is especially useful since the experimental data from the collaborations are presented in terms of so - called _ global signal strengths_. since the analysis of the data indicate that a cp - even scalar is preferred to a cp - odd one , we assume a single underlying cp - even scalar boson at a mass of about 125 gev and furthermore , we assume a simplifying zero - width approximation .",
    "this so - called _ interim framework _ has been used by the atlas and cms collaborations as well as in several phenomenological studies @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the software  for the implementation of the lhc data in the form of a @xmath9-function @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we apply bayesian inference within the framework of coupling scale factors .",
    "we shall use bayesian parameter inference to get a rough idea of how the parameters are constrained .",
    "however , since the most important question is rather that of which model best describes the data , we will focus on model comparison  in particular of different models in which any combination of couplings differ from their sm values .",
    "this framework makes it possible to compare many models to each other at once , but the main advantage is that it is possible to obtain evidence _ in favour _ of simpler models  in the present case for models where the couplings are given by their sm values .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : higgs ] , we give an introduction to higgs physics and the concept of coupling scale factors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : statistics ] , we discuss the bayesian method used in the present work , especially model comparison in the context of higgs couplings . in addition , we discuss the models used in the present work as well as the priors used . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we discuss the results of parameter estimation , and the results concerning the different questions addressed using model comparison . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we give a short summary and give our conclusions .",
    "whether the discovered particle at 125.5 gev actually is _ the _ sm higgs boson , or only a part of some bigger picture , is an important question which needs to be investigated . in general , additional degrees of freedom in the higgs sector will influence the higgs couplings to the sm particles as well as the loop - induced production and decay modes .",
    "one common way to investigate the possibility of new physics in the higgs sector is to study and compare specific renormalizable models for beyond the sm physics , such as two - higgs - doublet models @xcite , composite higgs models @xcite , a dilaton model @xcite , and supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "however , in these cases the comparisons are only made between these specific models and the sm , and obviously lack in generality .",
    "another way is to consider the sm extended with effective operators , resulting from new physics above the tev scale .",
    "since this new physics is heavy by assumption it will give rise to modifications of the couplings , which are suppressed by the scale of new physics .",
    "these modifications are however not necessarily small in magnitude if the scale of new physics is low @xcite . in both of the frameworks discussed above , some or all of the higgs boson couplings will be altered , both the magnitude and in principle also the tensor structure of the couplings , even though these modifications are often heavily suppressed .",
    "another approach is simply to not consider a physical and realistic model , but instead make a statistical analysis based on the `` naive '' rescaling of the magnitude of the higgs couplings .",
    "in such a framework it is only possible to investigate whether there are any significant deviations of the couplings from their sm values , without attempting to interpret the underlying physics .",
    "thus the relevant result of the analysis is whether the couplings deviate from their sm value or not , rather than the exact value of the couplings .",
    "this treatment with coupling scale factors shall be considered here .",
    "four production modes of the higgs boson in the sm are significant at the lhc .",
    "the predominant production mode is the loop - induced gluon fusion @xmath10 , with heavy quarks running in a triangular loop , with the main contribution coming from the top quark .",
    "since this process is loop - induced it is of particular interest in searches for new physics .",
    "the subdominant processes are vector boson fusion , @xmath11 , associated production with a vector boson , @xmath12 , and the associated production with a top - quark pair , @xmath13 .",
    "we will use the notation where @xmath14 and @xmath15 stands for any quark .",
    "the higgs boson can decay either to a fermion - antifermion pair or two gauge bosons . at present , the higgs boson have been detected in five decay channels at the lhc , namely the @xmath6 , @xmath16 ( in turn followed by a decay to @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 ( followed by decays to @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , @xmath7 , and @xmath21 , which then decay leptonically and hadronically . since the higgs coupling to fermions is proportional to the fermion mass , the heaviest fermion mode , which is kinematically accessible , will have the largest partial decay width in the sm . of the detected decay modes",
    "only @xmath22 is loop - induced , which are of particular interest for searches beyond the sm .",
    "in addition to the observed decay modes , the @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels have been investigated at the lhc .",
    "however , the higgs boson has not been detected in either of them and there are therefore only ( rather loose ) upper bounds in these channels at present @xcite .",
    "the lhc higgs results are commonly presented in terms of global signal strengths , defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cross section for the production mode @xmath27 and @xmath28 the branching ratio of the decay mode @xmath29 . in the case of a sm process",
    "the value of @xmath30 is naturally 1 . in the sm the higgs boson couples to the other particles with couplings @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "the couplings to the fermions are the yukawa couplings y^_f = , where @xmath33 is the mass of the fermion , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "the upper perturbative limit for these couplings is around @xmath36 . for the gauge couplings we have @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the @xmath40 and @xmath41 masses , respectively .",
    "note that these couplings are dimensionful .",
    "a simple extension of the sm can be made by rescaling the magnitude of the sm decay and production rates , which effectively leads to a rescaling of the higgs couplings by so - called coupling scale factors , @xmath42 .",
    "for the processes which exist at tree - level in the sm , the couplings are rescaled as @xmath43 naturally , the sm is recovered for @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , coupling scale factors can be introduced for the loop - induced processes .",
    "we introduce @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath10 and @xmath47 respectively . in principle , a scale factor , @xmath48 , could be introduced for a third loop - induced process @xmath24 .",
    "however , since the sensitivity is nowhere close to the region of the sm prediction and since the inference for the other parameters will not be affected , we will not include this as a free parameter .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath49 is then given by @xmath50 where @xmath42 and @xmath51 corresponds to the initial and final states respectively and @xmath52 is the scale factor for the total higgs decay width .    the coupling scale factors @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be considered either as functions of the other coupling scale factors or free parameters of the fit if new physics is allowed to participate in the loops . in the sm",
    "these scale factors have the values @xmath53 .",
    "however , in the case when only the tree - level scale factors are varied , the scale factors of the loop - induced processes will vary depending on the other scale factors .",
    "the effects of the rescaled tree - level couplings would have to be cancelled by some new physics , if these parameters were fixed to their sm values .",
    "if the scale couplings are free , new physics is allowed to propagate in the loop .    furthermore , the factor @xmath45 can be defined in two different ways , either in terms of partial cross - sections or decay widths . in the present case we define the coupling scale factor @xmath54 using the cross sections , since gluon fusion is the more important process . thus , the scale factor is given by @xmath55 in terms of the other @xmath56 s , @xmath46 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the partial decay widths and the pairs @xmath59 are given by @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the total higgs width scales with a coupling scale factor , which is defined in terms of the other coupling scale factors as @xmath63 where the summation runs over all possible decay modes in the sm .",
    "this parametrization requires that the resonance width is small and therefore the zero - width approximation is assumed . in principle , new physics could contribute to the total higgs width , which occurs if , for instance , the higgs can decay to dark matter particles .",
    "in this case @xmath52 should be a free parameter , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . for an extensive description of the concept of coupling scale factors ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work",
    "we shall focus on the coupling scale factors in two settings .",
    "first , the scale factors corresponding to the sm tree - level couplings ( and which are currently constrained by lhc data ) , _ i.e. _ , the higgs couplings to @xmath7 , @xmath64 , @xmath8 , @xmath65 , @xmath4 , and @xmath66 , have the possibility to be varied . in the second case ,",
    "the loop - induced processes have the potential to be scaled as well , through the variation of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we shall not consider the total decay width to be a free parameter in the present case .",
    "again , the information on effective scale couplings from lhc data were implemented using the  software .",
    "note that the new particle is assumed to `` resemble '' the sm higgs boson in a certain way . in principle , however , new physics will not only change the magnitude of the couplings but also their tensor structure .",
    "these new couplings usually are referred to as _ anomalous couplings _ , and",
    "the general statistical method of analysis , to be presented in the next chapter , would be applicable in that case as well .",
    "in this work , we will make use of bayesian probability theory , in which each proposition is associated with a probability or _ plausibility _ , defined to lie between 0 and 1 .",
    "this is the only consistent extension of boolean logic incorporating uncertainty @xcite .    in bayesian inference ,",
    "the laws of probability are used to infer which underlying hypotheses , assumption , or data model is preferred by some given set of data .",
    "of interest is _ bayes theorem _ , which can be used to reverse the order of the conditioning , denoted by `` @xmath67 '' , ( a|b ) = .",
    "thus , two different hypotheses or models can be compared using the data @xmath68 , through calculation of the _ posterior odds _ , given by @xmath69 the _ prior odds _",
    "@xmath70 quantifies how much more plausible one model is than the other _ a priori_. this ratio is typically taken equal to unity , which however must be considered more carefully in some cases .",
    "the _ evidence _",
    "@xmath71 is the likelihood of the model , a measure of how well the model describes , or rather predicted , the data .",
    "the _ bayes factor _",
    "@xmath72 is the ratio of the evidences of the two models and quantifies how much better @xmath73 describes the data than @xmath74 .",
    "given that the model @xmath75 contains the free parameters @xmath76 , the evidence is given by = ( |m ) & = & ( , |m)d^n + & = & ( | , m ) ( |m)d^n + & = & d^n , [ eq : z ] where @xmath77 is the _ likelihood function_. the prior probability density of the parameters is given by @xmath78 , and should always be normalized , _",
    "i.e. _ , it should integrate to unity .",
    "the assignment of priors are probably the most discussed and controversial part of bayesian inference .",
    "this is often far from trivial , but nevertheless this assignment is an important , even essential , part of any bayesian analysis .",
    "the bayes factors , or rather the posterior odds , are interpreted or `` translated '' into ordinary language using the so - called _ jeffreys scale _ , given in tab .  [ tab : jeffreys ] as used in , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ( `` @xmath79 '' denotes the natural logarithm ) .",
    "even though the bayes factor in general will favour the correct model once `` enough '' data has been obtained , the evidence is often highly dependent on the choice of prior .",
    ".__the jeffreys scale , which is used for interpretation of bayes factors , odds , and model probabilities .",
    "the posterior model probabilities for the preferred model are calculated assuming only two competing hypotheses and equal prior probabilities .",
    "note that @xmath79 denotes natural logarithm .",

    "we have performed a bayesian analysis of the lhc higgs data and used an interim framework where the magnitude of the higgs couplings are rescaled by coupling scale factors , whereas the tensor structure of the couplings is unaltered with respect to the sm . in the present work ,",
    "we have limited our discussion to the couplings which are constrained by the lhc , in total six tree - level couplings and two loop - induced couplings .",
    "we have performed bayesian parameter inference on these coupling scale factors in the following three cases : either the tree - level couplings , the loop - level couplings , or both simultaneously , were free . in each case",
    "the sm values were well within the @xmath80-region .",
    "however , when all couplings were free , neither @xmath81 nor @xmath82 were well - constrained and could in principle be zero .",
    "since the most important question is rather that of which model best describes the data , we have instead focused on bayesian model comparison , considering models with either only the tree - level couplings in the lagrangian , or all couplings , allowed to vary . in the first case , we used both a logarithmic prior , which was imposed directly on the tree - level couplings , and a gaussian prior , imposed on the coupling scale factors . in the second case , when the loop - induced couplings were also treated as free parameters , the analysis was made with a gaussian prior imposed on the coupling scale factors . in each case",
    "we performed model comparison between models with one , several , or all of the couplings free .",
    "the larger the number of free parameters , the more disfavoured the model was .",
    "we have considered a single coupling at a time in the cases where the other couplings could either be fixed to the sm values or allowed to vary with the same prior as the coupling of interest .",
    "the favoured models are those with the couplings fixed to the sm value , although the evidence is virtually non - existent for the coupling to @xmath65 .",
