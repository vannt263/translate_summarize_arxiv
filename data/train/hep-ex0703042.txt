    "its magnitude , @xmath16 , plays a central role in testing the consistency of the ckm matrix in @xmath0 and @xmath17 meson decay processes .",
    "inconsistency would signal existence of new classes of fundamental particles or forces .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath16 has been the subject of considerable theoretical and experimental effort for well over a decade , and remains one of the highest priorities of flavor physics .",
    "measurements of exclusive charmless semileptonic decays @xmath18  @xcite provide a route to the determination of @xmath16 with experimental and theoretical uncertainties complementary to the current inclusive techniques  @xcite .",
    "the primary challenge facing all measurements of semileptonic @xmath19 decay is separation of the signal from the much larger @xmath20 background .",
    "exclusive @xmath21 decays provide unique kinematic constraints for this purpose , particularly if a reliable estimate of the neutrino four - momentum is obtained .",
    "in addition to the experimental challenges facing the exclusive measurements , extraction of @xmath16 requires knowledge of the form factors that govern the dynamics of these decays .",
    "the form factors contribute both to the variation of rate , or shape , over phase space and to the overall rate via the form factor normalization .",
    "the form factors are inherently nonperturbative qcd quantities and considerable effort has been devoted to their calculation . a major recent theoretical advance has come in the form of predictions from unquenched lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations  @xcite , which provide predictions with uncertainties claimed to be at the 10% level for @xmath13 .",
    "light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) techniques also provide predictions for the @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath22 form factors  @xcite .    for the extraction of @xmath16 , we consider semileptonic decays to the pseudoscalar final states @xmath23 and @xmath24 , for which we have the unquenched lattice qcd predictions .",
    "we also investigate the decays to vector final states @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . an accurate determination of the decay rate to vector final states is necessary for quantifying cross feed into the @xmath13 rate that is ultimately used to extract @xmath16 .    in addition , we search for @xmath28 and @xmath9 . because semileptonic decays involve only a single hadronic current , they additionally offer a probe of the qcd phenomena underlying fully hadronic decay",
    ". in particular , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 decays probe the singlet or qcd anomaly component of the @xmath31 meson  @xcite .",
    "this component may be responsible for the unexpectedly high branching fractions observed in @xmath32 decays @xcite .",
    "a measurement of @xmath33 was included in previous cleo studies  @xcite , and in 2006 , babar released preliminary upper limits for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 branching fractions  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the cleo studies of these seven exclusive @xmath19 decay modes .",
    "the excellent hermeticity of the cleo detector and the symmetric @xmath36 beam configuration of the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) allows for precise determination of the neutrino four - momentum .",
    "in contrast to asymmetric @xmath0 factories , the lack of a center of mass boost along the beam direction enhances the fraction of @xmath37 events in which all particles are contained in the detector fiducial region .",
    "this allows more stringent selection criteria to be placed on the reconstructed neutrino that improve neutrino resolution without degrading efficiency .",
    "this ultimately results in a cleaner separation between signal and background that enables measurements of exclusive semileptonic rates at cleo to be competitive with higher statistics analyses carried out at asymmetric @xmath0 factories .",
    "we study all seven decay modes simultaneously , extracting independent measurements in subregions of phase space in order to minimize _ a priori _ dependence on form factor shape predictions . while the general method is similar to the previous cleo study  @xcite",
    ", the current analysis further reduces the sensitivity to the decay form factors by decreasing the lower bound on the charged - lepton momentum requirement for the vector modes from @xmath38 gev/@xmath39 to @xmath40 ( 1.2 ) gev/@xmath39 for electrons ( muons ) and , in addition , measuring partial rates for vector modes in bins of lepton decay angle .",
    "furthermore , our measurements of the rates over the @xmath41 phase space allow us to test the validity of form factor shape calculations in that mode .    to increase signal efficiency ,",
    "we have also modified the phase - space binning in the region of high meson recoil momentum , where continuum @xmath42 backgrounds contribute .",

    "this unexpected rate may be accounted for by the additional qcd anomaly  @xcite contribution to the @xmath31 axial vector current , which can be cleanly measured in semileptonic decays  @xcite .",

    "this study utilizes the full 15.5  fb@xmath5 set of data collected at the @xmath6 with the cleo  ii  @xcite , cleo  ii.5  @xcite and cleo  iii  @xcite detectors at cesr .",
    "the analysis rests upon associating the missing energy and momentum in each event with the neutrino four - momentum , an approach enabled by the excellent hermeticity and resolution of the cleo detectors .",

    "each charged track that is not identified as an electron or muon is assigned the most probable of the pion , kaon or proton mass hypotheses .",
    "the probability for each mass hypothesis is formed from an identification likelihood , based upon the specific ionization measurements in the drift chamber and either the time - of - flight or erenkov photon angle measurements , and the relative production fractions for pions , kaons and protons at that momentum in generic @xmath0 meson decay .    to reconstruct the undetected neutrino we associate the neutrino four - momentum @xmath117 with the missing four - momentum @xmath118 . in the process @xmath119 , the total energy of the beams",
    "is imparted to the @xmath120 system ; at cesr that system is very nearly at rest because beam energies are symmetric and the beam crossing angle is small ( @xmath121  2  mrad ) .",
    "the missing four - momentum in an event is given by @xmath122 , where the event four - momentum @xmath123 is known from the energy and crossing angle of the cesr beams and @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the four - momenta of charged and neutral particles explicitly reconstructed by the detector .",
    "charged and neutral particles pass selection criteria designed to achieve the best possible @xmath126 resolution by balancing the efficiency for detecting true particles against the rejection of false ones .    for the charged four - momentum sum @xmath127 , optimal selection is achieved with topological criteria that minimize multiple - counting resulting from low - momentum tracks that curl in the magnetic field , charged particles that decay in flight or interact within the detector , and spurious tracks .",
    "tracks that are actually segments of a single low transverse momentum `` curling '' particle can be mis - reconstructed as two ( or more ) separate outgoing tracks with opposite charge and roughly equal momentum . these tracks are identified by selecting oppositely charged track pairs whose innermost and outermost diametric radii each match within 14 cm and whose separation in @xmath128 is within 180@xmath129 .",
    "we choose the track segment that will best represent the original charged particle based on track quality and distance of closest approach information .",
    "we employ similar algorithms to identify particles that curl more than once , creating three or more track segments .",
    "we also identify tracks that have scattered or decayed in the drift chamber , causing the original track to end and one or more tracks to begin in a new direction .",
    "we keep only the track segment with the majority of its hits before the interaction point .",
    "spurious tracks are identified by their low hit density and/or low number of overall hits , and rejected .    for the neutral four - momentum sum , @xmath130 , clusters resulting from the interactions of charged hadrons must be avoided . as a first step , calorimeter showers passing the standard cleo proximity - matching ( within 15 cm of a charged track ) are eliminated .",
    "optimization studies also revealed that all showers under 50 mev should be eliminated .",
    "the processes that result in separately reconstructed showers ( `` splitoffs '' ) within about  25@xmath131 of a proximity - matched shower tend to result in an energy distribution over the @xmath132 central array of the splitoff shower that `` points back '' to the core hadronic shower .",
    "we combine this pointing information with the ratio of energies in the @xmath132 to @xmath133 arrays of crystals , whether the shower forms a good @xmath95 , and the mc predictions for relative energy spectra for true photons versus splitoff showers to provide an optimal suppression of the splitoff contribution .      to further enhance the association of the missing momentum with an undetected neutrino in our final event sample , we require that the missing mass , @xmath138 , be consistent within resolution with a massless neutrino .",
    "specifically , since the @xmath139 resolution scales as @xmath140 , for each exclusive @xmath18 mode we reconstruct , we require @xmath141 , with typical ranges of @xmath142 .",
    "the criterion was optimized for each decay mode using independent samples of mc simluations for signal and background processes .",
    "association of the missing four - momentum with the neutrino four - momentum is only valid if the event contains no more than one neutrino and all true particles are detected . for events with additional missing particles or double - counted particles ,",
    "the signal modes tend not to reconstruct properly , while background processes tend to smear into our sensitive regions .",
    "hence it is worthwhile to reject events in which missing particles are likely .",
    "we exclude events containing more than one identified lepton , which indicates an increased likelihood for multiple neutrinos .",
    "we require the angle of the missing momentum with respect to the beam axis satisfy @xmath143 .",
    "in addition to suppressing events in which particles exited the detector along the beam line , this requirement also suppresses events resulting from a collision of radiated photons from the beams .",
    "these two - photon events are background to @xmath120 events and are typically characterized by a large missing momentum along the beam axis .",
    "a nonzero net charge @xmath144 indicates at least one missed or doubly counted charged particle .",
    "the @xmath145 sample offers the greatest purity . for the pseudoscalar modes , use of the @xmath146 in addition to the @xmath145 sample offers a statistical advantage .",
    "events from the subset in which a very soft pion from a @xmath147 decay was not reconstructed in particular have only a modestly distorted missing momentum . while we retain the @xmath146 sample , we treat it separately from @xmath145 sample in reconstruction and fitting so that the statistical power of the latter sample , with its better signal to background ratio , is not diluted . for the vector modes , which have the poorest signal to background ratios , we require @xmath145 because systematic errors associated with the normalization of the larger background in the @xmath146 sample outweigh the statistical benefits .",
    "after our selection criteria , the remaining @xmath148 background events are dominated by events that contain either a @xmath149 meson or an additional neutrino that is roughly collinear with the signal neutrino .    with an estimate of the neutrino four - momentum in hand , we can employ full reconstruction of our signal modes . because the resolution on @xmath136 is so much larger than that for @xmath134",
    ", we use @xmath150 for full reconstruction .",
    "the neutrino combined with the signal charged lepton ( @xmath151 ) and hadron ( @xmath152 ) should satisfy , within resolution , the constraints on energy , @xmath153 , and on momentum , @xmath154^\\frac12 \\approx m_b$ ] , where @xmath155 , a momentum scaling factor , is chosen such that @xmath156 .",
    "the neutrino momentum resolution dominates the @xmath157 resolution , so the momentum scaling corrects for the mismeasurement of the magnitude of the neutrino momentum in the @xmath158 calculation .",
    "this correction also reduces the correlation between @xmath158 and @xmath157 mismeasurement .",
    "uncertainty in the neutrino direction remains as the dominant source of smearing in this mass calculation .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath159 for each decay from the reconstructed charged lepton four  momentum and the missing momentum .",
    "in addition to using the scaled reconstructed momentum @xmath160 described above , the direction of the missing momentum is changed through the smallest angle consistent with forcing @xmath161 .",
    "this procedure results in a @xmath47 resolution of 0.3 gev@xmath162 , independent of @xmath47 .",
    "a signal charged @xmath91 candidate must have the pion hypothesis as its most probable particle i d outcome , and it must not be a daughter in any reconstructed @xmath163 decay . a @xmath95 candidate must have a @xmath164 mass within 2 standard deviations of the @xmath95 mass and an energy greater than @xmath165 . each daughter shower must have an energy greater than @xmath166 .",
