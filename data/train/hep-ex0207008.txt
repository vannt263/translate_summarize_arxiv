    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) has been proven as an extremely successful effective theory for low energy hadron dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , the knowledge of higher order effects is rather scarse at present .",
    "the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 are well suited for investigation of higher order contributions . in both cases",
    "the lowest order @xmath5 vanishes@xcite and the next order @xmath6 can precisely been calculated , since no counter - terms exist@xcite ( fig .  [ fig : klpigg_feynman ] ( left ) ) .    the @xmath6 prediction of the @xmath0 branching ratio is @xmath7 to an accuracy of about @xmath8@xcite . calculations of the next order @xmath2 do not exist up to now .",
    "the measured value of @xmath9@xcite is in agreement with this prediction , however , the experimental errors were still too large to allow an accurate comparison .    for @xmath1",
    "it is known that @xmath6 alone underestimates the observed branching fraction by about a factor of three@xcite . at @xmath2",
    "the rate can be reproduced by adding a vector meson exchange contribution@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : klpigg_feynman ] ( right ) ) via the coupling constant @xmath10@xcite .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath10 has to be measured experimentally .",
    "additional interest in measuring @xmath1 arises , since it can constrain the cp conserving amplitude of the direct cp violating decay @xmath11 .",
    "the vmd mechanism could enhance the size of this amplitude , depending on the value of @xmath10@xcite .",
    "with ktev and na48 mainly two experiments have investigated neutral kaon decays into neutral final states in the recent years .",
    "both experiments were built to perform precise measurements on the parameter @xmath12 of direct cp violation . both are fixed target experiments with the neutral kaon beams being produced by high - energetic proton beams .",
    "the na48 experiment , located at the sps accelerator at cern , has been taking data for the @xmath13 measurement in the years @xmath14 and 2001 .",
    "in addition to the regular @xmath12 data taking , several runs with a high intensity @xmath15 beam have been taken , where the @xmath15 intensity has been increased by more than a factor of 200 with respect to the @xmath12 runs . in the year 2000",
    ", the spectrometer has not been available . in this year half of the data taking took place under @xmath12 conditions while the second half of the run period was performed with a high intensity @xmath15 beam .",
    "the ktev experiment is located at the tevatron at fermilab .",
    "it has been taking data in the years 1996 , 1997 , and 1999 with runs dedicated to determine @xmath13 and runs for measuring rare @xmath16 and hyperon decays .",
    "the data from the last year of data taking are mostly still being analyzed .      for detecting the photons in the final states of the decays discussed here , na48 and ktev use a quasi - homogeneous liquid krypton and , respectively , a csi crystal electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "by assuming a kaon decay , the @xmath17 position ( along the beam pipe ) of the decay vertex can be calculated to @xmath18 with the shower energies @xmath19 , distances @xmath20 , and the nominal kaon mass @xmath21 .",
    "if photons are lost , the missing energy shifts the vertex position down - stream towards the calorimeter .",
    "if the decay contains one or more intermediate @xmath22 , background can be suppressed by requiring the @xmath22 decay vertex to be consistent with the kaon decay vertex .",
    "for a decay rate measurement of @xmath0 in a fixed - target experiment an irreducible background of @xmath3 events has to be subtracted .",
    "therefore , a precise determination of @xmath3 is necessary while the current world average on @xmath24 has a relative error of about @xmath25@xcite .",
    "for this reason the na48 experiment has used a different method for subtracting @xmath3 events : in using the @xmath16 target run in 2000 with a very similar experimental set - up the relative rate @xmath26 is measured . by also measuring the @xmath27 rate in the high intensity @xmath15 run 2000 , the number of background @xmath3 events can then be accurately subtracted .",
    "the na48 @xmath16 target run of the year 2000 has provided very clean conditions to measure @xmath3 decays .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath28 or other @xmath16 decays are completely negligible , in particular @xmath29 dalitz decays are swept out by the spectrometer magnet .",
    "the only remaining background source is hadronic activity , e.g.  from @xmath30 decay products , which in rare cases might enter the decay volume via the @xmath16 beam line . to estimate this background the sidebands in the shower width and center - of - gravity distributions",
    "are evaluated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : klgg_bkg ] ) . by using both methods ,",
    "the hadronic background is determined to @xmath31 , where the error reflects the difference of the two estimations .",
    "the normalization channel @xmath27 , which needs three good @xmath32 combinations to be selected , is virtually background - free .",
    "both , signal and normalization channel have trigger efficiencies larger than @xmath33 . for the analyis only @xmath34 of the @xmath16 target run data",
    "were used which already provides sufficient statistics .",
    "evaluating the event numbers in the vertex region @xmath35  m  @xmath36  m ( measured from the @xmath15 collimator ) and taking the acceptance ratio from monte carlo simulation , na48 finds @xmath37 the systematic error is dominated by uncertainties in the @xmath38 acceptance ratio .",
    "this result improves the current world average by about a factor of four .",
    "in addition to the irreducible @xmath3 decays more background sources have to be taken into account when selecting @xmath0 candidates :    @xmath39 with lost and/or overlapping photons may fake a good @xmath40 event . since in these cases energy",
    "is lost , the neutral vertex is shifted down - stream .",
    "background from @xmath39 can therefore be efficiently rejected by restricting the allowed vertex range to be within @xmath35 and 5  m behind the final collimator .",
    "doing so , the remaining background from @xmath39 is estimated to @xmath41 , where the uncertainty is arising from the shower overlap probabilities being different in the simulation as in the data .",
    "further background sources are hadronic events ( originating e.g.  from scattering at the collimator ) or from accidentally overlapping events . both are determined by a sideband subtraction in the center - of - gravity distribution of the lkr calorimeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ksgg_bkg ] ) . from this , the total background from hadronic and accidental activity is estimated to @xmath42 .",
    "finally , dalitz decays @xmath43 and @xmath44 have to be taken into account . in the high intensity",
    "@xmath15 running in 2000 , the na48 experiment had no magnetic field in the detector .",
    "therefore , many dalitz @xmath45 pairs did not separate and were overlapping in the calorimeter . from monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the probability of a dalitz decay misidentified as @xmath40 pair was estimated to about @xmath46 .",
    "with dalitz decay probabilities assumed to be equal for @xmath47 and @xmath32 , the effect is twice as big for the @xmath39 normalization than in the @xmath47 events and results in a relative correction to the @xmath0 branching ratio of @xmath48 .    the decay vertex distribution of the na48 @xmath40 candidates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksgg_zvertex ] together with the estimated contributions of @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath39 background .",
    "the @xmath39 background contribution has been normalized to the absolute @xmath15 flux . in the fiducial region between @xmath35 and 5  m about 20000 @xmath40 candidates",
    "were found . subtracting all background contributions and normalizing to fully reconstructed @xmath39 events , the branching fraction was determined to @xmath49 the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the branching fraction of the @xmath39 normalization ( @xmath50 ) , the estimation of the hadronic and accidental background ( @xmath51 ) and the monte carlo statistics ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this new result significantly improves the previous measurements and is in clear discrepancy with the @xmath6 based theoretical predictions .",
    "with four photons in the final state the decay @xmath1 has almost the same signature as the cp - violating decay @xmath28 , which is one of the signal decays for the @xmath13 measurement of the ktev and na48 experiments .",
    "therefore the decay @xmath1 can be taken in parallel with regular @xmath12 data taking . moreover ,",
    "both signal and normalization ( @xmath28 ) have practically identical trigger efficiencies .",
    "however , the analysis of @xmath1 events has to fight strong backgrounds , in particular @xmath27 events with lost and/or overlapping photons , badly reconstructed @xmath28 events , and accidentally overlapping events .",
    "the na48 analysis@xcite , which is described more detailed in the following , is based on the na48 data of the years 1998 and 1999 .",
    "the suppression of background from @xmath27 with overlapping or lost photons is done by cutting on the shower width in the calorimeter . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : klpigg_bkg ] ( left ) , overlapping photons produce on average a much wider shower and can clearly be separated from the signal . to suppress the @xmath27 background even further ,",
    "a variable @xmath53 is constructed as estimate of the real kaon vertex under the assumption of a misidentified @xmath27 event . for real background events",
    "this variable should be in the physical region down - stream of the collimator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : klpigg_bkg ] ( right ) ) . by rejecting events with @xmath54  m",
    ", the @xmath27 background is reduced to @xmath55 .",
    "however , the signal acceptance is also reduced by @xmath56 .",
    "a second source of background are misidentified @xmath28 events .",
    "they are rejected by requiring the invariant mass @xmath57 of the photons not coming from the @xmath22 to be outside a window of @xmath58  mev/@xmath59 around the nominal @xmath22 mass . by using @xmath39 events from both @xmath12 and high intensity @xmath15 runs , the remaining background from @xmath28",
    "is estimated to @xmath60 .",
    "finally , good @xmath61 candidates may be mimicked by accidentally overlapping events .",
    "this background is estimated by extrapolating events with high transverse momentum into the signal region to @xmath62 .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath63 of the two photons originating from the @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : klpigg_m12_m34_y ] ( left ) . na48 finds 2558 @xmath1 candidates with an estimated background of @xmath64 events , which are used for the branching ratio measurement . for the fit of the vmd parameter @xmath10 , 345 ambigous events which allow",
    "two possible @xmath32 assignments are excluded .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is fitted using the distributions of both kinematic decay variables @xmath57 and @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : klpigg_m12_m34_y ] ) .",
    "the result of the fit is @xmath66 with the systematic error being dominated by uncertainties of the acceptance evaluation ( @xmath67 ) and the parametrization of the @xmath27 vertex@xcite ( @xmath68 ) .    for low @xmath57 the distributions of the @xmath22 signal @xmath63 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : klpigg_av ] .",
    "there is no significant signal of @xmath1 events for @xmath69  mev/@xmath59 , as expected for @xmath70 due to cancellation effects .",
    "nevertheless , in the region @xmath71",
    "mev/@xmath59 a clear signal shows up , which is evidence for a sizeable @xmath2 contribution to the @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "however , an analysis of the ktev experiment using the data of the years 1996 and 1997 , comes to a different result@xcite . performing a similar analysis",
    "as described above , ktev finds 884 signal candidates with estimated @xmath72 background events .",
    "fitting both the @xmath57 and @xmath73 distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : klpigg_ktev_m34_y ] ) the measured value of @xmath10 is @xmath74 also measuring a large @xmath2 contribution , but about @xmath75  standard deviations different from the na48 result .",
    "the systematics are dominated by the knowledge of the @xmath76 background . while na48 has finished the analysis on @xmath1 , the ktev collaboration plans to additionally analyze the data from the 1999 data taking period , which might help to understand the different results of the two experiments .",
    "the two experiments also arrive at different measurements of the @xmath1 branching fraction , which can partially be explained by the strong dependence of the detector acceptances on @xmath57 : @xmath77 { \\rm ktev } \\ ; ( 1999 ) : \\quad { { \\rm br}}({{k_{{\\mbox{\\tiny \\rm l}}}}\\to",

    "however , this does not hold for the @xmath10 value measured by ktev .",
    "the decay @xmath4 is dominated by the pion pole in @xmath39.to be able to distinguish this decay from the dominating @xmath39 , a minimum two - gamma invariant mass of @xmath78 is required .",
    "one theoretical investigation based on chpt exists@xcite , predicting the shape of the @xmath57 distribution together with a branching fraction of @xmath79 .",
    "no experimental observation or limit has been published so far .    using the data of a two - day high intensity @xmath15 run in 1999",
    ", the na48 experiment has performed a search for the decay @xmath4 . in this run about @xmath80 @xmath15 decays took place in the fiducial detector volume .    because of the smallness of the expected branching fraction , the main experimental problem is the background suppression .",
    "any non-@xmath81 activity in the photon anti - counters , drift chambers , and hadron calorimeter is vetoed . to suppress @xmath39 events , the @xmath82 of the event for being a @xmath39 decay is required to be larger than 2000 . in this way ,",
    "only @xmath83 mismeasured @xmath39 events are expected , as determined from monte carlo simulation .",
    "the main background then comes from @xmath39 decays with one lost and one accidentally in - time photon .",
    "this background is estimated by simulated and randomly triggered events to @xmath84 events .",
