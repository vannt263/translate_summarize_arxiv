    "the space - time has the timelike killing vector fields @xmath19 and two spatial killing vector fields with closed orbits , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the limit of @xmath22 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath23 with the other parameters kept finite , the metric coincides with that of the kerr - gdel black hole solution  @xcite with ctcs . in this article",
    ", we assume that the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath18 appearing in the solutions satisfy the following inequalities @xmath25 as will be explained later , these are the necessary and sufficient conditions that there are two horizons and no ctcs outside the horizons .",
    "( [ eq : para1])-([eq : para3 ] ) are conditions for the presence of two horizons , and eq.([eq : para4 ] ) is the condition for the absence of ctcs outside the horizons .",
    "it is noted that in the limit of @xmath23 with the other parameters finite , eq.([eq : para4 ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "thus , applying the squashing transformation to the kerr - gdel black hole solution , we can obtain such a kaluza - klein black hole solution without ctcs everywhere outside the black hole .      here",
    "we derive the parameter region ( [ eq : para1])-([eq : para4 ] ) from the demands for the presence of two horizons and the absence of ctc outside the horizons .",
    "as will be shown later , the killing horizons are located at @xmath26 which are the roots of the equation @xmath27 , i.e. , the quadratic equations with respect to @xmath28 , @xmath29 this equation has two different real roots within the range of @xmath30 if and only if the parameters in the metric obey the inequalities @xmath31>0,\\\\ & & m^2\\left[1 - 4j(a+2jm)\\right]^2 - 2a^2>0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the condition @xmath32 , these inequalities are equivalent to ( [ eq : para1])-([eq : para3 ] ) .",
    "next , in order to avoid the existence of ctcs outside the horizons , the parameters are chosen so that the two - dimensional @xmath33-part of the metric is positive - definite everywhere outside the outer horizon .",

    "@xmath37 here , it should be noted that it is sufficient to impose @xmath38 , which gives the equality ( [ eq : para4 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the condition for the absence of ctcs outside the horizons is equal to the demand for the absence of ctcs at the infinity .    in order to plot the parameter region ( [ eq : para1])-([eq : para4 ] ) in a two - plane",
    ", we normalize the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath18 as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively and furthermore , we fix the value of @xmath42 .",
    "then , in the cases of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the quadratic curve @xmath46 in the condition ( [ eq : para3 ] ) becomes an ellipse , a line and a hyperbola , respectively .",

    "therefore , two parameters @xmath77 with the opposite signs means the rotations in the same direction , and @xmath77 with the same signs means the rotations in the inverse direction .      here",
    "we investigate the near horizon geometry . as is mentioned previously , at the places such that @xmath27 , i.e. , at @xmath78 , the metric seems to be apparently singular but these correspond to killing horizons . to see this , we introduce new coordinates",

    "this means that the hypersurfaces @xmath81 are killing horizons since the killing vector field @xmath84 becomes null on @xmath78 and , furthermore , it is hypersurface - orthogonal , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "we should also note that in the coordinate system @xmath86 , each component of the metric form is analytic on and outside the black hole horizon .",

    "<S> one of the remarkable features is that the solution has two independent rotation parameters along an extra dimension associated with the black hole s rotation and the gdel s rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the space - time also admits the existence of two disconnected ergoregions , an inner ergoregion and an outer ergoregion . </S>",
    "<S> these two ergoregions can rotate in the opposite direction as well as in the same direction . </S>"
