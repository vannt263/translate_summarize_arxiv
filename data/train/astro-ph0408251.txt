    "a flurry of recent cosmological research has been focused on studying the galaxy intrinsic alignment . a question of galaxy intrinsic alignment is closely related to the origin of the galaxy angular momentum .",
    "the standard model for the origin of the galaxy angular momentum is the tidal torque theory @xcite . according to this theory ,",
    "the galaxy angular momentum is generated by the early tidal interaction with the surrounding matter that continued until the moment of the turn - around .",
    "a generic prediction of the tidal torque theory is the existence of a _ local _ correlation between the spin and the matter fields : the spin axes of proto - galaxies are preferentially aligned with the intermediate principal axes of the tidal shears from the surrounding matter .",
    "the degree of this galaxy intrinsic alignment must be highest at the moment of the turn - around .",
    "in the subsequent evolution , the galaxies are likely to lose gradually the initial memory about the surrounding matter due to the complicated nonlinear effects , with their intrinsic alignments diminishing in strength as a consequence .",
    "an important question in cosmology is whether the intrinsic alignment remains at present epoch to a statistically significant degree or not .",
    "it is important in cosmology since the galaxy intrinsic alignment plays a role of systematic error in weak gravitational lensing searches @xcite . besides",
    ", it can provide a crucial clue to the unsolved problem of galaxy formation @xcite , and be also used as a fossil record to reconstruct cosmology @xcite .    without knowing the tidal shear field accurately , it is difficult to measure the strength of the intrinsic alignment in practice directly from observational data .",
    "one possible way is to measure it indirectly from n - body simulation data @xcite .",
    "however , using n - body data , what one can measure is only the intrinsic alignment of underlying dark halos rather than that of the observable luminous parts of galaxies .",
    "although the standard theory of galaxy formation assumes that the spin axes of luminous parts align with those of dark halos @xcite , it was hinted by recent gasdynamical simulations @xcite that the luminous parts could conserve the initial memory of the intrinsic shear - spin correlation better than the dark matter parts , which prevents us from taking the simulation results as real ones .",
    "@xcite attempted to measure the strength of intrinsic alignment directly from observational data by reconstructing the tidal shear field with the data from the point source catalog of redshift survey ( pscz ) . although they claimed a detection of intrinsic shear - spin correlation , their measurement was far from being accurate due to the high statistical noise .",
    "the difficulty in measuring the galaxy intrinsic alignment lies in the fact that it is a local correlation between the galaxy spin and the surrounding matter fields effective only over a few mpc in a three dimensional space .",
    "however , it is often observed in the universe that the galaxies are surrounded by a coherent two - dimensional sheet - like structure which usually extends over tens of mpc . for such galaxies that are embedded in a sheet",
    ", one may expect a large - scale coherent orientation @xcite .",
    "it does not mean that the existence of cosmic sheets leads logically to the expectation of a large - scale coherence in the orientation of the galaxies .",
    "the two concepts are separate : the galaxy intrinsic alignment is due to the tidal torques from the surrounding matter , while sheets form through gravitational clustering as first collapsed objects @xcite .",
    "sheets are just one example of the large - scale structures that surround and tidally interact with galaxies .",
    "the expectation of a coherence in the orientation of the galaxies embedded in a sheet comes not from the existence of the sheet itself but from the large - scale coherent pattern in the two - dimensional matter distribution of the surrounding sheet .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to predict the coherent orientation of the galaxy spin axes relative the plane of the sheet in the frame of the tidal torque theory .",
    "furthermore , it may be also possible to evaluate quantitatively the strength of this intrinsic inclination of galaxies by an analytic method .",
    "the goal of this letter is to explore these possibilities .",
    "to evaluate the intrinsic alignment of galaxies embedded in sheets , we assume the following :    1 .   the galaxy angular momentum , or the galaxy spin vector ( @xmath0 ) is originated by the tidal shear effect from the surrounding matter at the proto - galactic stage , which continued till the moment of the turn - around .",
    "the growth of the proto - galaxy angular momentum is determined by its inertia tensor ( @xmath1 ) and the local tidal shear tensor ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the two tensors are strongly but not perfectly correlated with each other @xcite . the slight misalignment between the principal axes of the two tensors results in a preferential alignment of the proto - galaxy spin axis with the intermediate principal axis of the tidal shear tensor ( or similarly , the intermediate principal axis of the inertia tensor ) .",
    "the strength of the galaxy intrinsic alignment with local shears at present epoch can be expressed as the following simple quadratic relation @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rescaled traceless shear tensor defined as @xmath5 with @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a correlation parameter ( see appendix a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) introduced to quantify the strength of the intrinsic shear - spin alignment in the range of @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the value of @xmath7 can not be determined from 1st physical principles since it includes all the nonlinear effects after the moment of the turn - around .",
    "one should determine its value empirically .",
    "the probability distribution of galaxy spin vectors , @xmath9 , is well approximated as a gaussian @xcite .",
    "a cosmic sheet is the first collapsed object @xcite , forming as early as the turn - around moment @xcite . the minor axis of @xmath2 at each point on a sheet ( i.e.",
    ", the direction of its maximum compression ) is almost perpendicular to the plane of the sheet .",
    "we approximate the lowest eigenvalue of each @xmath2 on a sheet as zero coherently .      according to the third hypothesis in @xmath10",
    ", the distribution of a galaxy spin vector can be written as @xmath11^{1/2 } } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{l_{i}(m^{-1})_{ij}l_{j}}{2}\\right],\\ ] ] with the covariance matrix @xmath12 is related to @xmath2 by equation ( [ eqn : spin ] ) .",
    "let @xmath13 represent the three eigenvalues ( in a decreasing order ) of the tidal shear tensor @xmath2 at some point on the sheet .",
    "following the fourth hypothesis , we approximate @xmath14 s identically as zero at all points on the sheet .",
    "therefore , in the frame of the principal axis of the tidal shear tensor at each point , the polar angle @xmath15 of a galaxy spin vector @xmath16 represents the angle of the spin axis relative the plane of the sheet ( i.e. , the galaxy position angle ) .    to derive the distribution of the galaxy position angles relative to the plane of the sheet , we integrate equation ( [ eqn : pro ] ) in the principal axis frame of the tidal shear as @xmath17 , and derive the following analytic expression : @xmath18 where @xmath15 is assumed to be in the range of @xmath19 $ ] . here",
    "the three @xmath20 s ( @xmath21 ) are the rescaled eigenvalues of @xmath22 constrained by @xmath23 . for the case of @xmath24",
    ", they can be expressed in terms of the two eigenvalues @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27    equations ( [ eqn : ptheta])-([eqn : hatl ] ) show how the probability distribution of the galaxy position angles , @xmath28 , depend on the eigenvalues of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as the correlation parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the conditional distributions of the two eigenvalues provided that @xmath24 can be derived by using the bayes theorem : @xmath29 $ ] ( @xmath30 ) . here the two - point joint distribution @xmath31 and the one - point distribution @xmath32 are all obtained analytically by @xcite .",
    "using these results , we derive @xmath33\\bigg{\\ } } , \\\\",
    "\\label{eqn : l2 } p(\\lambda_{2}|\\lambda_{3}=0)&=&\\frac{27(3\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2 } ) } { 16\\sqrt{\\pi}\\sigma}\\bigg\\{\\frac{\\lambda^{2}_{2}}{\\sigma^{2 } } \\exp\\left(-\\frac{9\\lambda^{2}_{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\frac{\\sqrt{3\\pi}\\lambda_{2}}{12\\sigma}\\left(8-\\frac{9\\lambda^{2}_{2 } } { \\sigma^{2}}\\right ) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{45\\lambda^{2}_{2}}{16\\sigma^2}\\right){\\rm erfc } \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}\\lambda_2}{4\\sigma}\\right)\\bigg\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the rms fluctuation of the linear density field .    figure [ fig : cond ] plots the above conditional distributions ( eqs.[[eqn : l1]]-[[eqn : l2 ] ] ) .",
    "the dotted lines locate the most probable values of the two eigenvalues provided that @xmath24 : @xmath35 ; @xmath36 .",
    "we also determined the conditional mean and the standard deviation of each eigenvalue from equations ( [ eqn : l1])-([eqn : l2 ] ) : @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "putting @xmath41 and @xmath42 into equation ( [ eqn : ptheta ] ) , we can investigate how the distribution of the galaxy position angles relative to the plane of the sheets varies with the value of the correlation parameter @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : proc ] plots @xmath28 for five different cases of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( solid , dashed , long - dashed , dot - dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) . as expected , for the case of @xmath45 , @xmath28 is uniform , and the larger the value of @xmath7 is , the more sharply does @xmath28 increase in the small - angle section .",
    "in other words , the stronger the intrinsic shear - spin correlation is , the more inclined are the galaxy spins relative to the sheet . equation ( [ eqn : ptheta ] ) also allows us to evaluate the average position angles : @xmath46 .",
    "we find @xmath47 in unit of degree , if @xmath48 ( see in @xmath49 ) .",
    "a vivid example of such galaxies that are embedded in a two - dimensional sheet comes from the neighborhood of our milky way where nearby spirals are assembled in the local super cluster @xcite .",
    "although there were some reports of detecting a large - scale coherent orientation of the observed nearby spirals relative to the local super cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these previous reports often suffer from small sample sizes , hardly being established as compelling evidences .",
    "however , very recently , @xcite used a relatively large sample of nearby galaxies from the principal galaxy catalog ( pgc , paturel et al .",
    "1997 ) , and estimated the number distribution of nearby disk galaxies as a function of the supergalatic position angles .",
    "they found that the spin axes of nearby edge - on spirals ( @xmath50 km / s ) are strongly inclined relative to the supergalactic plane , and concluded that the observed result is consistent qualitatively with the tidal torque theory .",
    "yet , they did not make any quantitative comparison of the observed result with the predictions of the tidal torque theory .    to make a quantitative comparison",
    ", we evaluate the number distribution of galaxies embedded in sheets with equation ( [ eqn : ptheta ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : obs ] plots the results .",
    "the ( red ) dot - dashed line represents our theoretical prediction with the choice of @xmath51 ( the best - fit value ) , while the histogram corresponds to the observational result from pgc ( see fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    ". obviously , the theoretical curve agrees with the histogram very well .",
    "@xcite determined the average value of the position angles from the observed edge - on disk galaxies to be @xmath52 in unit of degree , which is in agreement of the theoretical value that we obtained assuming @xmath51 in @xmath53 .",
    "it is worth noting that the best - fit value of @xmath51 is three times higher than that found in n - body simulation @xcite .",
    "it may imply that the luminous parts of galaxies tend to keep the initial memory of the surrounding matter field better than their dark matter counter parts , consistent with the results from recent gasdynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "we have predicted analytically a large - scale coherence in the orientation of galaxies embedded in sheets using the tidal torque theory . our analytic model reproduces the observed inclinations of nearby spiral galaxies in the local super cluster remarkably well , providing a physical quantitative understanding of the observables .",
    "it should be , however , emphasized here that the prediction of the coherent orientation of galaxies embedded in a sheet should not be taken as identical to the existence of the sheet itself .",
    "the coherent orientation of the galaxies is caused by the tidal torquing from the surrounding matter , which is different from the formation of cosmic sheets in the universe .    by comparing our analytic prediction with the observational result",
    ", we also measured quantitatively the strength of the galaxy intrinsic alignment , and found that the luminous galaxies seem to conserve their angular momentum better than the underlying dark halos after the moment of the turn - around .",
    "our final conclusion is this : our analytic calculation , if applied to observational data from large scale surveys like sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , will allow us to measure accurately the strength of galaxy intrinsic alignment that will have an impact in weak gravitational searches , and can also be used as a fossil record to reconstruct cosmology .",
