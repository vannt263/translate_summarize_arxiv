    "an understanding of the mechanisms of formation and evolution of massive stars is of broad astronomical interest . through mass - loss and supernova explosions ,",
    "massive stars return a significant fraction of their masses to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , thereby chemically enriching and shaping the ism .",
    "being very luminous , they can be identified in external galaxies , providing spectrophotometric distance .",
    "observational constraints on the formation and evolution of massive stars are , however , difficult to obtain due to the rarity of these objects and their location in the galactic plane , where interstellar extinction can hamper their detection .",
    "massive stars can be identified by their ionizing radiation , which creates easily identifiable hii regions .",
    "furthermore , since the majority of massive stars are born in clusters @xcite , they are also identified by locating young massive stellar clusters . over the past decade ,",
    "infrared and radio observations of the galactic plane have revealed several hundred new hii regions , more than 50 new candidate supernova remnants ( snr ) @xcite , and 1500 new candidate infrared stellar clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are often found in the direction of hii regions .",
    "only a few of these infrared candidate clusters have been confirmed with spectro - photometric studies ; the analysis is often restricted only to stellar clusters and does not include the cluster environment .",
    "a combined study of stellar clusters and their associated molecular clouds is a powerful tool to understand star formation .",

    "the temporal and spatial distribution of clusters varies from cloud to cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "supernova explosions may trigger subsequent episodes of star formation in the same cloud .",
    "the presence of snrs indicates that a cloud has already undergone massive star formation , and the study of stellar clusters associated with snrs can shed light on the initial masses of the supernova progenitors , and therefore on the fate of massive stars .    by locating new hii regions , and young stellar clusters ,",
    "we also obtain information on large scale galactic structures .",
    "so far , we have only located clusters that reside in the near side of the galaxy , with a few exceptions , e.g. w49 @xcite .",
    "many issues on galactic structures are still open , e.g.   the exact number of spiral arms , the lack of star formation in the central 3 kpc , and the possible existence of a ring of massive star formation surrounding the central bar .",
    "stellar clusters selected from infrared observations are promising tracers for galactic studies because they sample a larger portion of the galactic plane than those from optical surveys @xcite .",
    "the candidate cluster number 9 in the list by @xcite ( hereafter , glimpse9 ) is an ideal target to study the issues above mentioned , because it is located in projection on a gmc that hosts several hii regions , supernova remnants , and candidate clusters .",
