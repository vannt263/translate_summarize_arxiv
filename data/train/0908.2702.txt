    "the halo mass function describes number density of dark matter haloes of a given mass in a given cosmology , and is an essential input for a diverse set of tools used for making theoretical predictions .",
    "the halo model of large scale structure , for example , is based on the theory of mass functions @xcite .",
    "accurate knowledge of the mass function is important for several cosmological applications , including semi - analytic theories of galaxy formation @xcite ; constraints on cosmological parameters using galaxy cluster abundance @xcite , merger rates for haloes @xcite , gravitational lensing and constraints on non - gaussianity in the primordial power spectrum @xcite of matter perturbation .",
    "it is possible to develop the theory of mass functions in a manner that makes no reference to the details of the cosmological model or the power spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "that is , we expect the mass function to take a universal form , when scaled appropriately .",
    "simple theoretical arguments have been used to obtain this universal functional form of the mass function @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the excursion set theory to derive the mass function .",
    "much work has also been done to determine the extent to which this form is consistent with results from n - body simulations @xcite with the conclusion that the agreement is fairly good .",
    "recent comparisons with very large n - body simulations also provide hints that the form of the mass function is not universal .",
    "the press - schechter mass function @xcite is based on the spherical collapse model @xcite and the ansatz that the mass in collapsed objects is related to the volume with density above a certain threshold .",
    "the shape of the mass function agrees with numerical results qualitatively : at a quantitative level there are deviations at the low mass and the high mass ends @xcite .",
    "improvements to the press - schechter mass function have been made to overcome this limitation .",
    "in particular , the sheth - tormen mass function is based on the more realistic ellipsoidal collapse model @xcite and it fits numerical results better .",
    "these mass functions relate the abundance of haloes to the initial density field in a universal manner , independent of cosmology and power spectrum .",
    "many fitting functions with three or four fitting parameters have been proposed .",
    "these are based on results of simulations of the lcdm model @xcite .    in the last few years , large n - body simulations of the lcdm model",
    "have demonstrated that the mass function is not universal @xcite , and epoch dependent fitting functions have been given for this model @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite also show a small dependence of the mass function on the power spectrum but given the size of simulations these deviations are small .",
    "these studies show non - universality by noting variations in the form of mass function with redshift or cosmology in successively larger simulations that explore a large range in mass .",
    "much of the numerical work in this area during the last decade has focused on the lcdm model , it being the model favored by observations .",
    "it is expected that this non - universality is a result of variation of mass function parameters either with cosmology or with the power spectrum or both .",
    "cosmology dependence is introduced by the variation in the threshold density for collapse @xcite .",
    "the cdm class of models have a power spectrum of density fluctuations with a gradually varying slope or the spectral index , @xmath1 , which decreases with decreasing scale ( increasing wavenumber @xmath2 ) . as perturbations at smaller scales collapse earlier , the effective index of the power spectrum is small at early times and increases towards late times .",
    "the threshold overdensity for collapse also changes as the cosmological constant becomes more important at late times .",
    "thus the variation in mass function may be due to the shape of the power spectrum , or cosmology , or both .",
    "this makes the published results difficult to interpret in terms of a theoretical model .",
    "it is then hard to discern any trends in non - universality that will potentially provide a physical understanding . given the number of applications of the theory of mass function like computation of merger rates , halo formation rates , etc . , it is essential to develop a clear understanding of the origin of non - universality .",
    "the only other option is to work with fitting functions for each of these quantities derived from n - body simulations .",
    "the problem of an unclear origin of deviations of universality can be partially addressed by studying a wider variety of models in the cdm class of models .",
    "this approach has been taken by , for example , @xcite in the context of universality in halo mergers .",
    "the effect of perturbations at larger scales in terms of the tidal field , which is relevant for ellipsoidal collapse , also changes with time due to the variation in the slope of the power spectrum with scale .",
    "given that the tidal field is generated by larger scales , it is not very clear whether a prescription based on the local index of the power spectrum alone can provide a detailed explanation for the mass function .",
    "since the cdm spectra lack the simplicity of the scale - free spectra , we approach this problem differently .",
    "we specifically look for departures from non - universality in the mass function for scale - free power spectra of initial fluctuations with an einstein - de  sitter background to check if the non - universal description can be attributed to a spectrum dependence .",
    "our choice of cosmology does not introduce any scale in the problem and the threshold overdensity does not vary with time in any non - trivial manner .",
    "thus we can isolate the non - universality of mass functions arising from the slope of the power spectrum .",
    "we provide spectrum dependent fits for the parameters in the sheth - tormen mass function , and show that this allows us to fit simulation data much better .",
    "we start with a discussion of the basic framework of mass functions in  [ massfunction ] , where we also set up the notation .",
    "our numerical simulations are described in  [ simulations ] .",
    "we present our analysis of the data in  [ results ] along with the results .",
    "a discussion of their implications appears in  [ discussion ] and we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the mass function is described by the following function in the press - schechter formalism : f()=(-^2/2 ) [ fps ] where @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the threshold overdensity for a spherically symmetric perturbation , above which it collapses and forms a virialised halo .",
    "it has only a weak dependence on cosmology and its value is @xmath5 for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "fitting functions that describe the dependence of @xmath4 on cosmology are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "we take the value of @xmath7 throughout our analysis as we are working with the einstein - de sitter cosmology .",
    "the _ rms _ fluctuations of the linearly evolved density field at present is denoted by @xmath8 , smoothed with a spherical top hat filter enclosing mass @xmath9 and is calculated by convolving the linear density power spectrum @xmath10 , extrapolated to the current epoch , with the filter @xmath11 : ^2(m ) = _ 0^w^2(k , m ) .",
    "lastly , @xmath12 is the growth function @xcite .",
    "all mass is contained in haloes in this formalism , this provides the normalization : _ 0^ f()d=1 this mass function is related to the number of haloes of a given mass per unit comoving volume by = f ( ) .",
    "[ norm ] the dependence on cosmology and power spectrum is absorbed in @xmath13 , and the theory of mass functions can be developed without reference to the detailed dependence of @xmath13 on the power spectrum or cosmology , so we expect the form of equation ( [ fps ] ) to be universal .",
    "the sheth - tormen mass function is a modification to the press - schechter model and is based on ellipsoidal collapse instead of spherical collapse .",
    "it has been shown to reproduce simulation results better .",
    "f()= a ( -q^2/2 ) .",
    "[ fst ] clearly , this is also a universal form .",
    ".details of @xmath0-body simulations used in this work . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "at the outset a visual inspection of figure ( [ fig_best_fit1 ] ) shows a clear trend in the shape of the mass function with index @xmath14 of the power spectrum .",
    "we also see that the evolution is self - similar across different epochs for all indices .",
    "this is as expected for power law models in einstein - de  sitter background .    in figures ( [ fig_best_fit1 ] ) and ( [ fig_best_fit2 ] )",
    "we find that for the more negative indices @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 we have a smaller dynamic range in @xmath13 as compared to @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "this is expected given that we have not evolved simulations with these indices over a large range of epochs due to finite boxsize considerations . since the slope of @xmath20 at the small @xmath13 end is related to @xmath21",
    " it is @xmath22 as @xmath23  one can not trust these results as much as the results with @xmath18 and @xmath19 which probe @xmath20 out to much smaller values in @xmath13 .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shown in columns 2 , 3 and 4 of table  [ table_bestfitpq ] for every model ( column 1 ) .",
    "surprisingly @xmath25 is relatively low for all indices as compared to the index @xmath26 .",
    "part of this is due to several outliers for the @xmath26 spectrum which have more than @xmath27 deviations . removing these points",
    "we find that @xmath28 from the original value of @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath30 changes to @xmath31 from @xmath32 . in figure ( [ fig_npq_relation ] )",
    "we also add the best fit value of @xmath21 and @xmath33 from the recent work of @xcite , which used @xmath34 realizations of an lcdm simulation with @xmath35 particles in a box of side @xmath36mpc .",
    "we identify the effective index at @xmath37 , by computing .|_=1 = -    next we look at the dependence of the two st parameters @xmath24 on the index of the spectrum @xmath14 and also their interdependence . in figure ( [ fig_npq_relation ] ) we find that all the trends seen between @xmath21 , @xmath33 and @xmath14 ( @xmath38 for lcdm ) are smooth when one considers the lcdm model and the power law models with indices @xmath39 .",
    "we find that the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath14 is approximately p(n ) -0.0605",
    "n + 0.141 [ eq_pn ] the trends in these parameters show deviations when one adds the models @xmath40 and @xmath41 , especially in the values of @xmath21 ; deviations in @xmath33 are not as drastic . however",
    "if we use equation ( [ eq_pn ] ) and fix @xmath21 for the indices @xmath42 and redo the @xmath43 analysis to fit @xmath33 then the @xmath43 does not change much , thereby corroborating our argument that the values of @xmath21 for the models @xmath40 , @xmath41 are unreliable due to the small range in @xmath13 .",
    "the new values of @xmath44 are listed in columns 5 - 7 of table (  [ table_bestfitpq ] ) .",
    "figure  ( [ extrapol ] ) plots the best fit st curve using the extrapolated value of @xmath21 for the models @xmath42 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "since we have not probed highly non - linear scales for these models the range of @xmath13 is even more limited , so much so that a full @xmath43 minimization for @xmath24 is futile .",
    "we therefore do not list the best fit values of @xmath24 in table (  [ table_bestfitpq ] ) and proceed to do a similar fitting using equation ( [ eq_pn ] ) for the models @xmath45 , @xmath46 and find that @xmath47 is is in the same range as for other models .",
    "the values @xmath48 for these models are given in columns 5 - 7 of table (  [ table_bestfitpq ] ) .",
    "again we find that the @xmath47 is reasonable giving credence to the extrapolation of equation ( [ eq_pn ] ) .",
    "however the trend between @xmath49 and @xmath38 is reversed when we compare with the lcdm runs of @xcite .",
    "here @xmath21 decreases and @xmath33 increases with increasing redshift ( increasing @xmath38 ) , at @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to note that in the simulations used in @xcite , it is not possible to probe @xmath51 .",
    "however at this redshift , @xmath52 has a dominant role thereby making a simple interpretation difficult . we are carrying out a series of numerical experiments where we simulate power law models in a background cosmology with a cosmological constant to develop further understanding of this issue .",
    "@xcite reported a reduced @xmath53 for the sheth - tormen mass function with their data .",
    "our values of @xmath54 are similar and confirm that the sheth - tormen mass function is inadequate in fitting the data in power law models .    the sheth - tormen parameters also show a clear dependence on the index of the spectrum .",
    "one approach of alleviating this problem would be to better model barrier shape using simple models like the ones we have here .",
    "these can then be used to construct and compare with more complicated barriers arising due to different cosmology and a scale dependant index like the cdm class of models .",
    "the other approach can be purely phenomenological : one can use results from simpler models like those studied here and understand how further complications in the model , like running index and different cosmologies , affect the shape of the mass function .",
    "our focus has been on demonstrating that the mass function has a dependence on the slope of the power spectrum . in this study",
    "we have not looked at how a change in the definition of the halo  for example , change in the linking length in fof halo finder or using the so halo finder instead of fof @xcite  affects the mass function .",
    "indeed one expects that the halo definition changes the amplitude of the mass function @xcite but we do not expect it to affect our results in a significant manner .",
    "we postpone a study of the dependence of the sheth - tormen parameters on halo definition to a later paper .",
    "at least one mass function model with dependence on spectrum index have been considered in the literature @xcite . this is derived by modifying the peaks picture of @xcite , in which the initial gaussian density field is filtered at a certain scale and number density of peaks of a certain height in the smoothed field is taken to be the number density of haloes of mass corresponding to the smoothing scale .",
    "@xcite modifies this mass function by smoothing the density field with a range of filter sizes and identifying haloes with peaks of varying heights so that more massive haloes correspond to higher peaks . for a power law spectrum of initial density fluctuations",
    ", this mass function can be derived analytically and has an explicit dependence on the spectral index .",
    "we compare the @xcite mass function with our simulations by using a gaussian filter instead of real - space top hat in equation ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "we find that the model does not fit our results well .",
    "we summarize the conclusions of the present study here .",
    "* we find that the mass function is not universal and has an explicit dependence on the power spectrum . *",
    "the sheth - tormen parameters show a systematic trend with index of the power law power spectrum .",
    "we also find that there is a correlation between these parameters .",
    "* evolution of the mass function @xmath20 in power law models in an einstein de  sitter background is self - similar , i.e. , the functional form does not change with time for a given power law model .",
    "we do not expect this in the cdm class of spectra since the effective index , @xmath55 , changes with redshift .",
    "however , the spectrum dependence of @xmath21 and @xmath33 is not very strong , and the range over which @xmath55 varies is not very large , hence the usual st parameters are an adequate first approximation .",
    "variation of st parameters becomes relevant if we require a very precise description of the mass function .",
    "* our @xmath43 analysis shows that sheth - tormen mass function is inadequate and that better modeling of collapse with more parameters is needed . *",
    "finite box size considerations impose serious limitations on running simulations with large negative indices of the power spectrum .",
    "this end of the spectrum probes the mass function of high redshift objects .",
    "the way out would be to run orders of magnitude larger simulations for indices with @xmath56 .",
    "this is a challenge and would be overcome only in the next generation of simulations .",
    "one can possibly use zoom in simulations but the displacements for these models are large , as is the large scale tidal field , and hence the extent to which one can benefit from zoom in simulations is not obvious . * for models with @xmath57 , the rate of growth for @xmath58 with time is very slow and as a result a large number of time steps are required for evolving the system .",
    "the adaptive treepm @xcite may be useful for running such simulations .",
    "computational work for this study was carried out at the cluster computing facility in the harish - chandra research institute ( http://cluster.hri.res.in/index.html ) .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
