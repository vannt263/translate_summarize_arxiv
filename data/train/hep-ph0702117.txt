    "the resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) has been developed @xcite for the description of meson - meson scattering resonances and bound states , in a non - perturbative approach that aims at unquenching the @xmath3 confinement spectrum .",
    "it consists of a simple analytic expression which can be straightfrowardly applied to all possible non - exotic systems of two mesons .",
    "the rse goes beyond simple spectroscopy , since it describes the scattering amplitude , not only at a resonance , but also for energies where no resonance exists .",
    "in contrast to models which have to rely upon numerical methods of solution , the rse has the additional advantage that the pole structure of its scattering amplitude can be studied in great detail , owing to its closed analytic form .",
    "the expression for the amplitude can even be analytically continued , in an exact manner , to below the lowest threshold , where bound states show up as poles on the real energy axis .",
    "the rse easily handles many coupled meson - meson channels , or coupled systems with different internal flavours . as such",
    ", it is an ideal expression for the study of scattering theory in general , i.e. , the study of resonance structures and their relation to some of the many @xmath1-matrix singularities , as well as the concept of riemann sheets and analytic continuation anywhere in the complex energy plane .",
    "moreover , it is particularly powerful in examining the properties of scattering amplitudes near the lowest threshold , since there it can effectively be reduced to a one - channel case , with just two riemann sheets . in the present paper",
    ", we shall study isoscalar @xmath1-wave @xmath2 scattering near threshold , thereby ignoring the small mass difference between neutral and charged pion pairs .",
    "the basic ingredients of the rse are confinement and quark - pair creation . in its lowest - order approximation ,",
    "a permanently confined quark - antiquark system is assumed , having a spectrum with an infinite number of bound states , related to the details of the confining force .",
    "we shall denote the energy levels of this confinement spectrum by @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , 1 , 2 , @xmath6 ) . here",
    ", we assume that the confinement spectrum is given by @xmath7 which choice is anyhow rather immaterial for the purpose of our present study .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 represents , to lowest order , the ground - state mass of the quark - antiquark system , which is related to the effective flavour masses of the system .",
    "the strength of the confinement force is parametrised by @xmath9 and gauged by the level splittings of the system . in experiment",
    "one can not directly measure the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , because of the large higher - order contributions .",
    "consequently , the lowest - order system is purely hypothetical .",
    "nevertheless , one can obtain some order - of - magnitude insight by examining mesonic spectra with more than one experimentally known recurrency .    from the @xmath10 charmonium and bottomonium states",
    ", one may conclude that the average level splitting is of the order of 380 mev , leading to @xmath11 mev , independent of flavour .",
    "the latter property is compatible with the flavour blindness of qcd , confirmed by experiment @xcite .",
    "indeed , the level splittings of the positive - parity @xmath12 mesons seem to confirm that flavour independence can be extended to light quarks @xcite . from the ground states of the recurrencies",
    "one may then extract the order of magnitude of the effective quark masses , e.g.  @xmath13 gev ( in the rse @xcite we find for twice the effective charm mass the value 3.124 gev ) , or @xmath14 gev ( 0.812 gev in the rse ) . for the choice ( [ t00ho ] ) of confinement force , we determine @xmath15 .",
    "once the effective flavour masses and @xmath9 are fixed @xcite , we may describe other systems , like scalar mesons and mixed flavours @xcite .    through quark - pair creation",
    "the @xmath3 system is coupled to those two - meson systems which are allowed by quantum numbers . in principle",
    ", many different two - meson channels can couple to one specific quark - antiquark system . here",
    ", since we study the properties of the channel lowest in mass , we will strip the rse of all other possible two - meson channels , thereby assuming that their influence far below their respective thresholds will be negligible . via consecutive quark - pair creation and annihilation",
    ", a @xmath3 pair may also couple to pairs of different flavour , for instance @xmath16 . here , as we study pion - pion scattering near threshold , we shall assume that the coupling of a light pair of flavours to strange - antistrange can be ignored .",
    "the intensity of quark - pair creation is in the rse parametrised by the flavour - independent parameter @xmath17 . in principle",
    ", it has to be adjusted to the data .",
    "however , one may get an idea of the right order of magnitude by the following reasoning . for small values of @xmath17",
    ", one may determine the width of the ground - state resonance in the one - channel case ( pion - pion here ) by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the average distance at which light quark pairs are created , and which can also be defined in a flavour - independent fashion @xcite . for light quarks , @xmath19 is about 0.6 fm , as we will see later on .",
    "if we take , for example , the @xmath20(1370 ) resonance width of 0.20.5 gev , then we obtain @xmath21 0.600.95 .",
    "this is of the order of 1 , which would not allow the approximation ( [ rsewidth ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we actually employ here a value for @xmath17 which is of the same order of magnitude as our estimate ( see caption of fig .  [ t00figures ] ) .",
    "the rse amplitude suitable for our purposes results from the ladder sum in quark - pair creation @xcite , and has for @xmath0 @xmath1-wave @xmath2 scattering the form @xmath22 where @xmath4 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ t00ho ] ) , and where @xmath23 the factor @xmath24 is a remnant @xcite of the quark - antiquark distributions associated with the confinement spectrum ( [ t00ho ] ) .",
    "the amplitude ( [ t00rse ] ) satisfies the unitarity condition @xmath25 for all energies @xmath26 , as can be easily verified .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ t00figures ] we compare the rse amplitude with the amplitude of weinberg @xcite and the dispersion - relation result of caprini , colangelo and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "weinberg s relation is given by @xmath27 we do not distinguish here between neutral and charged pions , and take the pion mass equal to the one of the charged pions . at threshold",
    "we find for the rse @xmath28 which may be compared to data at @xmath29 @xcite .    in the lefthand side picture of fig .",
    "[ t00figures ] one observes from the behaviour of both @xmath30 and @xmath31 that the rse clearly describes a resonant structure , i.e. , the @xmath20(600 ) alias @xmath32 meson .",
    "however , for energies above 600 mev , the rse prediction does not follow the data .",
    "the main reason is the absence of a coupling to @xmath33 in the @xmath3 sector , as well as the @xmath34 channel ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "however , for energies below 400 mev the agreement with the data is excellent . even below threshold , at about 280 mev",
    ", the hypothetical data of ref .  @xcite are fairly well reproduced .",
    "in fact , the rse only deviates because it does not exactly reproduce the so - called adler zero @xcite for non - vanishing total invariant mass @xmath35 .",
    "this does not mean that above threshold , where the rse scattering amplitude does agree with the true data , the real part of @xmath36 can not be proportional to something of a form similar to weinberg s expression ( [ t00weinberg ] ) .",
    "it only means that below threshold the analytic form of @xmath37 may be slightly different from what is predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite , for very small , unphysical values of @xmath35 .    in order to study this in more detail ,",
    "we expand formula ( [ t00rse ] ) near threshold ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath38 & & \\times\\ , \\left\\{\\ , e^{2}\\ , + \\ , 4m_{\\pi}^{2}\\,{{\\frac{\\textstyle \\raisebox{5pt}{$\\frac{1}{3}a^{2}m^{2}_{\\pi}s_{1}-s_{2 } -\\frac{1}{2}s_{1}^{2}+s_{1}s_{2 } + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{2}{3}a^{2}m^{2}_{\\pi}\\right ) s_{1}^{3}$}}{\\textstyle \\raisebox{-5pt}{$\\left ( 1-\\frac{1}{3}a^{2}m^{2}_{\\pi}\\right ) s_{1}+s_{2 } -\\frac{3}{2}s_{1}^{2}-s_{1}s_{2 } + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{2}{3}a^{2}m^{2}_{\\pi}\\right ) s_{1}^{3}$ } } } } \\right\\ } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\label{t00thrapprox}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath39 insertion of the model parameters ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ t00figures ] ) yields @xmath40 consequently , we find that the apparent `` adler zero '' in the rse , as seen from above threshold , is almost twice the value that follows from eq .",
    "[ t00weinberg ] .",
    "anyhow , the behaviour of @xmath30 below threshold can not not be a simple continuation of the form above threshold , since the derivative of @xmath30 at threshold is discontinuous , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ t00figthreshold ] .",
    "+ [ 3pt ]    the crucial point is that one can not analytically continue the real part of the amplitude , for the trivial reason that the real part of an analytic function is not analytic .",
    "hence , where @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 ) precisely has its zero is rather irrelevant for the behaviour of @xmath30 for @xmath43 .",
    "for example , the twice - subtracted dispersion relations of ref .",
    "@xcite yield a zero at @xmath44 for the amplitude .",
    "however , when the real part of the same amplitude is extrapolated from above threshold to below threshold , according to an approximation of the form ( [ t00thrapproxab ] ) , then one finds a zero at @xmath45 .",
    "alternatively , we may consider the modulus of the amplitude ( [ t00rse ] ) , for which the derivative at threshold is continuous , and which behaves near threshold according to @xmath46    this is probably where hanhart in ref .",
    "@xcite mixed up the rse with perturbative considerations , when claiming that the rse amplitude does not behave properly at threshold because the amplitude vanishes for @xmath47 .",

    "( see caption fig .",
    "[ t00figures ] ) .",
    "namely , @xmath50 the adler - weinberg zero at @xmath51 only holds in lowest order in the chiral expansion @xcite .",
    "higher - order terms then move it to a different value @xcite .",
    "we observe here that the higher - order corrections are substantial , by comparing the values obtained from the threshold behaviour in the rse for the amplitude s born term ( eq .  [ toorsepertab ] ) and for the full amplitude , either for its real part ( eq .  [ t00thrapproxab ] ) , or alternatively for its modulus ( eq .  [ toorsemodulus ] ) .",
    "the predictive power of the rse as an analytic method to unquench the quark model has been demonstrated before , by interrelating an enormous variety of non - exotic mesonic systems , such as the light scalar mesons @xmath20(600 ) , @xmath20(980 ) , @xmath52(800 ) , @xmath53(980 ) and the corresponding @xmath1-wave @xmath2 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 scattering observables @xcite , the scalars between 1.3 and 1.5 gev @xcite , vector and pseudoscalar mesons @xcite , charmonium and bottomonium @xcite , the @xmath56(2317 ) @xcite , and the @xmath57(2860 ) @xcite . in the present letter",
