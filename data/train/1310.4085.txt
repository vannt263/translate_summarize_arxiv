    "the bloch walls , which could be seen as chiral interfaces @xcite , are used in the context of extra dimensions to construct a @xmath0 model of two scalar fields coupled with gravity , the so called bloch brane @xcite .",
    "the bloch brane model is generated dynamically and has internal structure .",
    "the asymptotic bulk metric is a slice of a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "such scenario may be used to mimic a brane - world containing internal structure @xcite , which have implications on the density of matter - energy along the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the internal structure could be also observed by a splitting effect on the curvature invariant .    on the other hand , dutra et al .",
    "have showed that the bloch brane scenario addressed in @xcite , holds more general soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "the brane configurations obtained from these new solutions were named by the authors as _ degenerate bloch branes _ due to the existence of a degeneracy parameter that is not present in the lagrangian density .",
    "such defects present more details as the appearing of two - kink solutions .",
    "these additional features were interpreted as the formation of a double wall structure .",
    "when the degeneracy parameter approaches to a critical value , the brane splits in two and its separation become larger .",
    "this effect will contribute to the emergence of massive graviton resonances .",
    "the phenomenon of two separate interfaces on the defect is known in condensed matter physics as complete wetting @xcite . moreover , the same behavior was considered as a critical phenomena of phase transition on thick branes in warped geometries @xcite .    in the above scenarios",
    "some authors have investigated the localization of several types of bulk fields .",
    "namely , fermion fields @xcite , gauge fields @xcite and graviton zero mode @xcite .",
    "however , the study of the graviton massive spectrum has not been properly studied .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , the search for resonances in warped spacetimes @xcite has received attention because they give us important information about the interaction of kaluza - klein ( kk ) massive spectrum with the four - dimensional brane . specifically in the study of gravity localization",
    ", the presence of a resonance at zero energy is related to the existence of a large - distance region on which the 4d laws of gravity are valid @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the resonance width becomes very large it results in nonphysical effects .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "the first work about localization of graviton zero mode on the bloch brane was the work of bazeia and gomes @xcite .",
    "their results were also confirmed on the degenerate bloch branes by dutra et al .",
    "however , the important issues concerning the analysis of the massive spectrum and the search for resonances in these scenarios have not been addressed .",

    ", we can see that for the limit @xmath25 the one - field scenario is recovered . for certain values of the coupling parameter @xmath26 that controls the brane thickness , we have a splitting of the defect and the appearance of an internal structure .",

    "the seminal work of bazeia and gomes @xcite considering the bloch brane model performed an analysis in the zero modes of the graviton but have not confirmed the existence of resonant modes . from now",

    "[ fig : gravblochpot ] we plot the potential @xmath44 varying @xmath26 . as in the curvature scalar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gravbloch0 ] ) we note the appearance of a splitting effect due to the thickness of the defect .",
    "the minimum of the potential separates in two as we reduce @xmath26 , acquiring the shape of a double - well - type potential .",
    "similar feature was also found in the potential of the shredinger equation for the tt sector of the metric perturbations in a thick brane scenario generated by one scalar field @xcite .    for some specific energies , the solutions of eq .",
    "could exhibit large amplitudes inside the brane in comparison with its values far from the defect .",
    "these solutions are interpreted as resonant modes and reveal states with large probabilities to be found on the brane @xcite .    from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : schro ] ) we can consider @xmath45 as the probability for finding the mode on the brane , where @xmath46 is a normalization constant . in this way , we must know the variation of this quantity in terms of @xmath47 in order to find possible resonant modes .",
    "for this purpose , we first consider two different methods to detect resonant modes .",
    "one of them uses directly the probability of finding the mode on the brane from the square of the normalized wave function @xcite , namely @xmath48    a second method uses the relative probability @xcite : @xmath49 in both approaches , the massive modes are considered in a box with borders @xmath50 far from the turning points .",
    "the difference between the two methods is that in the case of relative probability @xmath51 we have a narrow integration range around the brane @xmath52 conveniently chosen such that @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for using this approach is that , since thick branes are objects spread around the origin of the extra dimension , the probability of finding the modes must be integrated in a small region around the location of the defect in order to detect resonances .",
    "furthermore , according to the formal quantum theory of resonance , we can study the probability of finding the massive modes around the vicinity of the brane position within a relatively large region @xcite .",
    "we must choose one of the probability methods based on their efficiency to detect in a better way the resonant modes on the kk spectrum ( if they exist ) .",
    "such structures are characterized by large amplitudes inside the brane in comparison with the amplitude outside .",
    "thus we first compare the two functions @xmath54 and @xmath51 to choose the more suitable .",
    "due to the coordinate transformations and the complexity of the @xmath55 function , we can not find @xmath56 analytically .",
    "therefore , we solve the eq . by numerical integration and compare the functions @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "the result is showed in fig .",

    "[ fig : gravbloch1 ] that the resonance peak is more pronounced and broader on the @xmath51 function .",
    "this characteristic shows that using @xmath51 we can detect more easily possible narrow resonance structures .",
    "then , we will adopt @xmath51 in our analysis henceforth .    since we consider the kk modes @xmath65 in a box with borders @xmath50 , beyond which @xmath65 are turned into plane waves ,",
    "the @xmath66 value should not interfere with the mass of the resonant modes to maintain the consistency of the method .",
    "this is a fundamental characteristic because the physical information is contained in the value of the resonance peak , which should not depends on @xmath66 , since it is chosen sufficiently large . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gravbloch2 ] , we plot the function @xmath51 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "as expected , the position of the resonant mode in @xmath51 is not altered when we vary @xmath66 .",
    "we must now analyze the behavior of the function @xmath51 as well as its dependence on the thickness of the membrane .",
    "the real parameter @xmath26 controls the thickness of the defect and may give rise to an internal structure on the membrane .",
    "this characteristic can be verified by analyzing the structure of the potential as well as the matter energy density in terms of @xmath26 , as shown in ref .",

    "the resonance becomes very broad characterizing states with lifetimes too short to result in any physical effect .",

    "the authors directed their analysis to the stability and zero mode solutions of the graviton , but now we generalize the analysis to the massive spectrum in a quantum mechanics scenario . on these new solutions , which were called degenerate bloch walls ( dbw ) ,",
    "the brane thickness is controlled by the variation of a parameter associated to the domain wall degeneracy .",
