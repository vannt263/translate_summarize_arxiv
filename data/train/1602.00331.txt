    "the essence of our approach consists in the following .",
    "previously in the paper @xcite the so - called synthetic frequency method , allowing to radically suppress thermal ( bbr ) shift in atomic clock , was proposed .",
    "however , an ideology of this method can be easy extended on cancelling of arbitrary systematic shift .",
    "indeed , let us consider two clock frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( different in the general case ) .",
    "assume that due to a certain physical cause we have the stabilized frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are shifted relative to the unperturbed frequencies at the values @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 also assume that the ratio @xmath10=@xmath11=@xmath12 does not fluctuate , while the shifts @xmath13 can be varied during experiment ( i.e. , @xmath13@xmath14@xmath12 ) . in this case , we can construct the following superposition : @xmath15 which is insensitive to the perturbations @xmath13 and their fluctuations .",
    "this frequency we will call as ` synthetic frequency ' . a key advantage of this concept consists in the following : to construct the shift - free frequency @xmath16 we do not need to know the real values of shifts @xmath13 , because we need to know only their ratio @xmath10 , which can be exactly calculated ( or measured ) for many cases .",
    "let us show how to incorporate the synthetic frequency protocol in the ramsey spectroscopy for significant suppression of probe - induced shifts in atomic clocks .",
    "the general idea can be understandable from the reasonings related to the two - level system with unperturbed frequency @xmath17 .",
    "it is well - known that the standard ramsey spectroscopy @xcite uses two exciting pulses of resonance field with the frequency @xmath18 , which are separated by the free evolution interval @xmath19 ( dark time ) [ see in fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme](a ) ] . in this case",
    ", the spectroscopic signal has a functional dependence on the detuning @xmath20=@xmath21 , which consists of set of narrow resonances with width of order of @xmath22 ( so - called ramsey fringes ) .",
    "the central fringe can be used as reference point for stabilisation of frequency @xmath18 in atomic clock .    consider an influence of probe - induced shift @xmath23 , which arises only during the ramsey pulses",
    "[ see two - level scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ] , while this shift is absent during the dark time @xmath19 . as a result",
    ", the stabilized frequency @xmath24 also becomes differing from unperturbed frequency @xmath17 : @xmath25 where the index @xmath19 denotes the fixed time of the free evolution interval under frequency stabilization , and the resulting shift @xmath26@xmath140 exists due to the @xmath23@xmath140 . on the basis of general principles",
    ", it can be shown that the dependence @xmath26 on the value @xmath19 can be expressed as the following decreasing series in terms of powers of @xmath27 : @xmath28 where the coefficients @xmath29 depend on the pulse parameters ( durations , amplitudes , phases , and the value @xmath23 ) .    because the time @xmath19 is precisely controlled in experiments",
    ", then we can set a goal to eliminate the main contribution @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ shift_gen ] ) using the synthetic frequency protocol . to solve this task",
    "we will apply two different dark intervals @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( but with the same ramsey pulses ) , which will give us the corresponding stabilized frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath34 . using eqs .",

    "we need to use three different time intervals ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath45 ) with the corresponding stabilized frequencies ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "in particular , we will consider the case of @xmath31=@xmath19 , @xmath32=@xmath40 and @xmath45=@xmath47 , for which the required superposition takes the form : @xmath48 as it will be shown below , the value @xmath49 can be less than @xmath36 [ see eq .",
    "( [ syn_1_1 ] ) ] by several orders of magnitude .    using the same logic ,",
    "the above procedure can be formally extended to the @xmath50-th order , when we will consider the synthetic frequency @xmath51 and corresponding residual shift @xmath52=@xmath53 .",
    "in this case , the frequency @xmath51 is a special superposition of ( @xmath54 ) different stabilized frequencies ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , ... , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) corresponding to the dark time intervals ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , ... ,",

    "let us describe a computational algorithm , which allows us to calculate the signal in the ramsey spectroscopy .",
    "the action of a single light pulse ( with frequency @xmath62 , duration @xmath63 , and rabi frequency @xmath64 ) on two - level atoms with ground and excited states , @xmath65@xmath66@xmath67 and @xmath68@xmath66@xmath69 ( separated by the unperturbed energy @xmath70 ) , is described by the matrix : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the generalized rabi frequency .",
    "the detuning during pulse @xmath73 contains the excitation related shift @xmath23 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] , level scheme ) due to the influence of other ( far - off - resonant ) transitions . within the frequency interval corresponding to the narrow clock resonance",
    "the variation of @xmath23 on @xmath62 is negligible , i.e. , @xmath23 can be considered as a constant ( for fixed @xmath74 ) .     of different duration ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; panel ( a ) ) .",
    "during the pulses , we step the laser frequency @xmath18 by @xmath77 ( panel ( b ) and text ) . hyper - ramsey scheme with composite second pulse @xmath78 ( panel ( c ) and text ) .",
    "also shown is a two - level atom with splitting @xmath79 , detuning @xmath20 of the laser with frequency @xmath18 during dark time @xmath19 , and excitation related shift @xmath23 during pulses . , width=321 ]    during the dark period between the pulses , excitation related shifts ( which produce the total actual shift @xmath23 ) are absent ( e.g. , the ac - stark shift from the laser ) or can be turned off ( like the zeeman shift ) .",
    "if during the dark period @xmath19 the laser frequency is @xmath18 , then the free evolution is described by the matrix @xmath80 with detuning @xmath81 , where the matrix @xmath82 is determined as : @xmath83 in the general case , the laser frequency during the pulse does not have to be the same as the frequency during the dark time , i.e. , @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "as we will see , at times it can be useful to approximately offset the induced shift , @xmath23 , by stepping the laser frequency only during the pulses by a fixed @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme](b ) ] .",
    "thus , in the general case the detuning during the pulses can be written as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the effective frequency shift during the pulse ( instead of @xmath23 ) .",
    "this manipulation allows us to stabilise the frequency @xmath18 under controlled condition @xmath89@xmath901 ( independently of the value @xmath23 ) , which makes it possible to radically suppress the probe - induced shifts with the use of hyper - ramsey spectroscopy @xcite even for the large actual shifts @xmath23 : @xmath91@xmath921 . indeed ,",
    "if the actual level shift @xmath23 is comparable to or larger than @xmath64 , we can always apply a frequency step @xmath77 ( e.g. , with an acousto - optic modulator ) during excitation to achieve the condition @xmath93 for an effective shift @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath77 can be evaluated experimentally by variation of the dark period @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath95 , the observed transition frequency will be dependent on @xmath19 @xcite . with a control of the shift to 1% under typical conditions we can achieve @xmath96 to 0.1 .    formulas ( [ w ] ) and ( [ v ] ) are sufficient for description of the signal in ramsey spectroscopy .",
    "for example , if at @xmath97 atoms are in the lower level @xmath65 , then after the action of two pulses of duration @xmath75 and @xmath76 separated by dark period @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) the population @xmath98 of atoms in the excited state @xmath68 is determined by latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : n_e } n^{(e)}=\\left|\\langle",

    "the presence of the additional shift @xmath94 in the course of the pulse action leads to the shift of the central ramsey fringe with respect to the unperturbed frequency @xmath79 .",
    "before the consideration of the synthetic frequency protocol , note some general points .",
    "first of all , we assume that the position of the central fringe @xmath24 is determined by stepping the phase of one of the pulses by @xmath100 in the way @xcite and equalizing these signals .",
    "this approach is of greater relevance for clocks , because it directly generates an error signal with high sensitivity . in respect to the signal ( [ eq : n_e ] ) , this method is formulated as following .",
    "let us introduce the phase steps @xmath101 after dark time @xmath19 , which can expressed by the use of function @xmath102 and the error signal @xmath103 : @xmath104 then the shift @xmath26 of stabilized frequency @xmath24 is determined as solution of the equation @xmath105 relative to the unknown @xmath20 .    at first ,",
    "let us consider the standard ramsey spectroscopy , in which both exciting pulses have the equal duration @xmath75=@xmath76=@xmath63 .",
    "in the case of @xmath106=@xmath107 and @xmath108@xmath90@xmath19 , the dominating contributions have the following linear dependencies on the small value @xmath89@xmath1091 : @xmath110 here due to smallness of the ratio ( @xmath111)@xmath901 ( i.e. , for short ramsey pulses ) we have the chain of inequalities : @xmath112@xmath90@xmath113@xmath90@xmath114 .",
    "thus , the synthetic frequency protocol can significantly suppress the shifts even for standard ramsey spectroscopy .",

    "<S> exceptional accuracy and stability at the 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath0 level are achieved . </S>",

    "<S> current state , concomitant problems , and future prospects are well presented in the review @xcite .    on the way to these remarkable achievements , </S>",
    "<S> different barriers arise , which require the development of new unconventional approaches . as an example , for some of the promising clock systems , one of the key problems is the frequency shift of the clock transition due to the excitation pulses themselves . for the case of magnetically induced spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> @xcite these shifts ( quadratic zeeman and ac - stark shifts ) could ultimately limit the achievable performance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for ultra - narrow transitions ( e.g. , electric octupole @xcite and two - photon transitions @xcite ) the ac - stark shift can be so large in some cases to rule out high accuracy clock performance at all . </S>",
    "<S> a similar limitation exists for clocks based on direct frequency comb spectroscopy @xcite due to ac - stark shifts induced by large numbers of off - resonant laser modes .    </S>",
    "<S> unconventional solution to this important problem was proposed in the paper @xcite , in which so - called hyper - ramsey method has been developed . </S>",
    "<S> soon this approach was successfully realized in @xcite , where the huge suppression ( by four orders of magnitude ) of probe - induced shifts was experimentally demonstrated ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , a potential of this method was not going to be settled . in the experimental - theoretical paper </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a ` stunning ' result was recently shown : certain simple modification allows , in principle , _ totally _ ( ! ) to exclude probe - induced shifts . </S>",
    "<S> other hyper - ramsey modification , having the same efficiency , was very soon proposed in the theoretical paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because these phenomenal results can have far - reaching consequences for development of atomic clocks , it requires utterly thorough investigation of the schemes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , undoubted importance has a search of new variants to suppress probe - induced shifts with the near extremal efficiency .    in this paper , we develop an universal method to dramatically suppress probe - induced shifts and their fluctuations in any type of atomic clocks . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on adaptation of so - called synthetic frequency concept @xcite to the ramsey spectroscopy with the use of interrogations for different durations of free evaluation intervals . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this protocol in combination with the original hyper - ramsey scheme @xcite makes most extremal results and is quite stable with respect to the decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our method leads to the much better and robust suppression of the shifts in comparison with protocols @xcite , which are more sensitive to the decoherence and therefore do not show phenomenal results already . </S>"
