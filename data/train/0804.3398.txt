    "high gravity , in the absence of radiative forces , together with significant convection zones , allows the downward sedimentation of heavy elements to proceed rapidly in cool white dwarfs ( schatzman 1958 ) .",

    "different biases contribute to the varying percentages between the zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and koester et al . studies .",
    "since the biases for these two surveys have not been accounted for , a definitive fraction of daz vs. da has yet to be determined . ] .",
    "since the diffusion timescales for heavy elements are shorter than the white dwarf evolutionary timescales , the source of the metals observed in the photospheres of these white dwarfs can not be primordial .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) seems like a natural candidate for the source of metals in white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "however , the sun is located in a very low density region , and the volume filling factor of clouds in the local ism is much less than 25% , the percentage of da stars showing metallic features in the nearby white dwarf sample .",
    "in addition , zuckerman et al . ( 2003 ) and kilic & redfield ( 2007 ) found no correlation between the accretion density required to supply metals observed in daz white dwarfs with the densities observed in their interstellar environment , indicating that ism accretion alone can not explain the presence of metals in these nearby degenerates .",

    "the presence of metals in the atmosphere is almost certainly related to the circumstellar material at these stars .",
    "if the source of the photospheric metals observed in several daz stars is accretion from circumstellar disks , there is no a priori reason to assume that the same mechanism does not work for dbz white dwarfs .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy that the fraction of metal - bearing to non - metal - bearing stars is similar for both hydrogen and helium atmosphere white dwarfs ( koester et al .",
    "however , because helium is relatively transparent compared to hydrogen , db stars and their cooler counterparts have photospheres which are more readily contaminated than da stars ( zuckerman et al .",
    "additionally , these heavy contaminants can stay present in cool helium atmospheres for myr timescales , owing to massive convection zones ( paquette et al.1986 ) .",

    "the timescale for poynting - robertson drag at the inner disk edge of such a @xmath14 k daz is close to 30 days ( von hippel & thompson 2007 ) , and if the process which replenishes the warmest dusty material is not continuous , it could result in k - band flux variations .",
    "wd 1150@xmath2153 is a zz ceti variable with a dominant period of 250 s and an optical pulsation amplitude of 0.8% ( gianninas et al .",
    "2006 ; koester & voss 2006 ) ; expected to be an order of magnitude smaller in the near - infrared . normalizing each spectrum by the average flux between 1.44 and 1.82@xmath1 m ( the 2mass @xmath10-band ) , the total @xmath11-band flux increased by 0.2% in 2007 , and decreased by 4.3% in 2008 , relative to the total flux observed in 2006 . however , this level of variability is well within a typical @xmath18% photometric error for a single near - infrared obervation in clear weather conditions , which we did not have .",
    "therefore , it is likely that these differences are due to calibration errors caused by variations in sky brightness and extinction due to non - photometric conditions .",
    "further photometric observations are needed to rule out possible changes in the disk .",
    "kilic & redfield ( 2007 ) reported 2 near - infrared spectroscopic observations of gd 362 separated by nearly 1 year , which did not reveal any variations .",
    "like their daz counterparts , most dbz white dwarfs do not show near - infrared excess due to dust disks .",
    "the only reported helium - rich white dwarf with a clear @xmath11-band detectable ( disk ) excess is gd 362 , yet this star is also very hydrogen - rich and daz - like , both in its spectral ( gianninas et al . 2004 ) , compositional ( @xmath19 ( h / he ) = @xmath20 ; zuckerman et al .",
    "2007 ) , and physical properties ( b. hansen 2008 , private communication ) . in order to better constrain the fraction of dusty white dwarfs among spectral types dbz and daz",
    ", we now consider all such stars with published irtf and _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "figure 5 presents a plot of @xmath8 versus calcium abundance for 39 daz stars ( koester et al .",
    "2005a , zuckerman et al .",
    "2003 ) , 37 of which have now been observed at the irtf and/or with _ spitzer_. there are 7 observed stars which have debris disks , corresponding to an overall fraction of 18.9@xmath21% . due to small sample size , we used a binomial probability distribution to derive statistical uncertainties for the frequency of disks .",
    "since the probability distribution is not symmetric about its maximum value , we report the range in frequency that delimits 68% of the integrated probability function as error bars .",
    "these error bars are equivalent to 1@xmath22 limits for a gaussian distribution ( see the discussions in mccarthy & zuckerman 2004 and burgasser et al . 2003 ) . if we include the daz analog gd 362 , the fraction of daz white dwarfs with disks goes up to 21.1@xmath23% .",
    "only 1 nearly pure db white dwarf with metals is known to have a dust disk , the recently reclassified dbaz gd 40 ( @xmath19 ( h / he ) = @xmath26.0 ; voss et al . 2007 ) , corresponding to 1 of 19 stars in table 1 with @xmath19 ( h / he ) @xmath24 ( abundances typical for db white dwarfs with hydrogen ; voss et al . 2007 ) , or 5.3@xmath25% .",
    "if we limit our sample to ground - based observations only , this value goes down to 2.6@xmath26% for hydrogen - poor white dwarfs and 14.3@xmath27% for hydrogen - rich white dwarfs .",
    "dust disks appear less frequent among helium versus hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs , and the difference appears to be significant at the 2@xmath22 level .",
    "if the observed difference in the frequency of dusty daz and dbz stars is real , and the above analysis supports that conclusion , then this result is consistent with the difference in their respective , typical diffusion timescales .",
    "the diffusion timescales for metals are a few to several orders of magnitude longer in helium - rich atmospheres compared to hydrogen - rich analogs . for a @xmath28 , 10000 k helium atmosphere white dwarf , the diffusion timescale for calcium is on the order of @xmath29 yr ( paquette et al .",
    "1986 ) , whereas it is only @xmath30 yr for a daz of the same temperature .",
    "therefore , a lower fraction of dust disks around helium - rich degenerates may imply the disk lifetimes are shorter than the metal diffusion timescales , a scientifically interesting constraint on these poorly understood compact disks . while there may once have existed circumstellar dust around some or many polluted , helium - rich white dwarfs , these",
    "have either completely dissipated ( become fully consumed by the star ) , or remain in gaseous phase and hence undetectable in the infrared .",
    "any photospheric metal remnants should persist for myr timescales in the relatively massive convection zones of these helium degenerates , and , in principle , could even be periodically replenished by the ism .",
    "recently , farihi et al . ( 2007 ) announced the discovery of a dust disk around another helium - rich white dwarf , gd 16 , which also possesses significant amounts of atmospheric hydrogen .",
    "gd 16 is classified dazb ( as gd 362 ) with @xmath19 ( h / he ) = @xmath31 ( koester et al .",
    "2005b ) . the presence of appreciable amount of hydrogen in a helium - dominated atmosphere can shorten the diffusion timescales for heavy elements significantly , presumably due to the outermost layers being dominated by the lighter gas . both gd 362 and",
    "gd 16 probably behave more like daz stars in terms of their diffusion timescales ( b. hansen 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "hence , the discovery of disks around these particular helium- and hydrogen - rich stars may not be suprising , as the stars are more likely to be presently accreting in order that the observed metal lines are present in their optical spectra .",
    "gd 40 , the only nearly pure db with a dust disk , also has trace amounts of hydrogen .",
    "however , the hydrogen abundance in gd 40 is lower by 35 orders of magnitude relative to gd 16 and gd 362 .",
    "voss et al . ( 2007 ) found that 55% of db white dwarfs in the temperature range 10000 k  30000 k show hydrogen at a similar level to gd 40 ( log(h / he)@xmath32 ) .",
    "this fraction goes up to 62% for the temperature range of our sample ( 10000  20000 k ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the source of hydrogen in gd 40 is also responsible for its presence in other db white dwarfs ( see voss et al .",

    "2007 ) white dwarf samples . one caveat , however , is the outstanding problem of da white dwarf mass estimates from spectroscopy for effective temperatures less than 12000 k ( for a thorough review of this problem , see kepler et al .",
    "2007 ) . in a nutshell",
    ", the presence of unseen helium ( and possibly other neutral particles ) can skew cooler da masses towards higher values ; perfectly exemplified by the mass estimate for gd 362 prior to the high resolution detection of atmospheric helium ( zuckerman et al . 2007 ; gianninas et al .",
    "there are only a few targets in table 2 which belong in this category , and our results are unlikely to be affected by the situation , but we mention it for completeness and due to the fact that da field white dwarf mass measurements purposefully exclude stars in this temperature range ( liebert et al .",
    "therefore , we can not say whether a trend exists between disk frequency and white dwarf mass , but a larger sample of such stars , combined with parallaxes to remove any mass estimate ambiguity introduced via spectroscopy for cooler da type stars , may prove more insightful on this astrophyscially important topic .",
    "based on previous works on white dwarfs with disks , it appears probable that the circumstellar material should be associated with surviving planetary system bodies , and hence any correlation between disks and host mass would imply a correlation between planetary systems and host mass .",
    "the cumulative mass distributions for hydrogen- and metal - rich white dwarfs with ( dazd ) and without ( daz ) disks from the koester & wilken ( 2006 ) analysis are shown in panel ( b ) of figure 6 .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates that there is a 48% probability that the dazd white dwarfs are randomly drawn from the general distribution of daz white dwarfs .",
    "about half of these daz stars are also analyzed by p. bergeron in various papers ( e.g. liebert et al .",
    "2005 ; bergeron et al . 2001 ) ; panel ( c ) shows the daz mass distribution using these mass estimates .",
    "a k - s test shows that the probability that the daz and dazd distributions are similar is 81% .",
    "thus , based on the 7 dazd white dwarfs , there is no correlation apparent between the frequency of disks and degenerate mass .",
    "panel ( d ) of figure 6 shows the cumulative mass distributions for the da and daz white dwarfs analyzed by zuckerman et al .",
    "masses for these white dwarfs are derived from the quoted stellar parameters , where known ( i.e. log @xmath47 not assumed ) , and bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) tabulated models .",
    "a k - s test shows that the null hypothesis is 28% probable ; we do not find a significant difference between the da and daz mass distributions .",
    "if all metal - rich white dwarfs accrete from dusty or gaseous circumstellar material , and if there is a connection between white dwarf disks and planets , then we might expect metal - rich white dwarfs to be more massive than normal white dwarfs if planets occur more frequently around intermediate mass stars .",
    "however , there exists theoretical and now some empirical evidence that certain types of planetary systems may induce significant mass loss on the first and asymptotic giant branches ( siess & livio 1999a , b ) .",
    "nelemans et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed a scenario to explain the formation of single , low mass white dwarfs via enhanced mass loss due to planets or brown dwarfs which spiral into the first ascent giant envelope ; essentially analogous to the standard ( binary ) formation scenario for low mass , helium core white dwarfs and subdwarf b stars ( han et al .",
    "moreover , the 3 @xmath48 planet orbiting the sdb star v 391 pegasi ( silvotti et al . 2007 ) may have belonged to a multiple planet system in which the innermost planet(s ) were cannibalized to create the 0.5 @xmath42 helium - burning primary , which should evolve directly into a low mass white dwarf .",
    "therefore , any correlation between stellar mass and planet - disk frequency could be erased or marginalized by similar processes .",
    "our search for near - infrared excess at 15 metal - rich , helium atmosphere white dwarfs did not reveal any new evidence for disks .",
    "we tentatively conclude that circumstellar material is responsible for the photospheric metals in at least 20% of the hydrogen - rich white dwarfs and no more than 5% of the hydrogen - poor white dwarfs .",
    "the lower frequency of disks at externally polluted , helium - rich yet hydrogen - poor white dwarfs possibly reflects a typical disk lifetime which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the @xmath49 yr diffusion timescales for metals in pure helium atmospheres . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher discovery rate of disks around metal - contaminated , hydrogen - rich white dwarfs ( including types daz and dazb ) analogously reflects short diffusion times compared to disk lifetimes , which favor discovery of disks in metal line da white dwarfs .",
    "in addition , we searched for @xmath11-band flux variations in the daz wd 1150@xmath2153 , and did not observe significant changes within 1.7 yr , implying that the warmest emitting material at the inner edge of the disk remains largely unchanged .",
    "we also studied the mass distribution of metal - rich white dwarfs with disks in order to search for similar trends between the frequency of disks and the predicted frequency of gas giants around intermediate mass stars , but given the current small number statistics and errors , the probability that dusty white dwarfs are more massive than normal white dwarfs is not significant .",

    "<S> here , we present near - infrared spectroscopic observations of 15 helium atmosphere , metal - rich white dwarfs obtained at the nasa infrared telescope facility . </S>",
    "<S> while a connection has been demonstrated between the most highly polluted , hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs and the presence of warm circumstellar dust and gas , their frequency at the helium atmosphere variety is poorly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> none of our targets show excess near - infrared radiation consistent with warm orbiting material . adding these near - infrared constraints to previous near- and mid - infrared observations , the frequency of warm circumstellar material at metal - bearing white dwarfs is at least 20% for hydrogen - dominated photospheres , but could be less than 5% for those effectively composed of helium alone . </S>",
    "<S> the lower occurrence of dust disks around helium atmosphere white dwarfs is consistent with myr timescales for photospheric metals in massive convection zones . analyzing the mass distribution of 10 white dwarfs with warm circumstellar material , we search for similar trends between the frequency of disks and the predicted frequency of massive planets around intermediate mass stars , but find the probability that disk - bearing white dwarfs are more massive than average is not significant . </S>"
