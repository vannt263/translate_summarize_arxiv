    "with the evidence in favor of neutrino masses and mixing at a convincing level now , attempts to seek the role of physics beyond the standard model in the neutrino sector are acquiring enhanced degrees of urgency .",
    "as it is , the lack of naturalness of the mass of the higgs boson in the standard model is a strong pointer towards new physics around the tev scale .",
    "since tiny masses can be explained by appealing to energy scales much higher than the electroweak scale ( for example in the seesaw mechanism ) , it is appropriate to link neutrino mass generation to new physics options at the tev scale or above .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a frequently explored possibility for new tev - scale physics .",
    "its capability for solving the naturalness problem being an accepted fact , serious efforts are on at accelerators to see signals of susy , broken with an intra - supermultiplet mass splitting @xmath6(tev ) .",
    "does susy play a role in providing the requisite new physics component in the masses and mixing pattern of neutrinos ?",
    "this is the question that we would like to address .",
    "often one has to go beyond the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) in order to find satisfactory mechanisms which can achieve this end . though a fair amount of work has been done in this area @xcite , one is yet to have a satisfactory answer to the following central question related to the neutrino sector .",
    "why is the mixing pattern of neutrinos , with two large and one small mixing angles , so drastically different from that in the quark sector , where the mixing between the three generations can be cryptically described by the progression - small , smaller , smallest ?    in this paper we approach the above problem with the idea that the difference between the two mixing patterns arises from some aspects of the susy model which are specific to neutrinos and with no counterparts in the quark sector . for this , we make use of nonrenormalizable terms arising from high - scale physics .",
    "such terms , coupling some hidden sector ( gauge singlet ) chiral superfields to the mssm ones , are suppressed by the planck mass @xmath7 or some power of it .",
    "if these terms violate lepton number , they can lead to majorana masses for neutrinos .",
    "when , in addition , there are superfields containing right - chiral neutrinos , contributions to the neutrino mass matrix can come not only from the well - known seesaw mechanism but also radiatively via one - loop diagrams containing right chiral sneutrinos .",
    "though both these contributions have been included in earlier works @xcite , a clear explanation of the different character of mixing for neutrinos vis - a - vis quarks has been lacking without the imposition of some additional restriction on the low - energy theory .",
    "the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite is an example of such additional theoretical inputs .",
    "the literature , of course , is rich with uses of various other symmetries @xcite , as well as of ` anarchy ' in the neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "drawing inspiration from all these approaches , we suggest an alternative justification of bilarge neutrino mixing by postulating an array of gauge singlet chiral superfields with flavor - dependent nonrenormalizable couplings to neutrinos .",
    "the specific superpotential that yields the desired results is formulated , and consistency with the observed suppression of flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in the lepton sector is used as a constraint .",
    "one further has radiative contributions , pertaining only to the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "these are due to the fact that the right chiral sneutrinos may acquire gauge singlet @xmath8 mass terms .",
    "the scenario for neutrinos then immediately becomes quite distinct from that in the quark sector .    using the standard seesaw as well as the above - mentioned radiative contributions , we have examined whether high - scale parameters , such as the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of scalar as well as of auxiliary components of the gauge singlet chiral superfields , crucial to this mechanism , are in otherwise acceptable ranges of values .",
    "for instance , the higgsino mass ( @xmath9 ) parameter needs to be around the weak scale for the desired implementation of the spontaneous breakdown of electroweak symmetry .",
    "such analyses are carried out for the three alternative possibilitiess of the neutrino mass spectrum allowed by the neutrino oscillation data , namely , normal hierarchy , inverted hierarchy and degenerate neutrinos .",
    "the simultaneous importance of the radiative as well as the seesaw contributions enables us to acquire in all the three scenarios substantial regions ( of different extent in each case ) in the parameter space of our model that correspond to acceptable solutions .    in section 2",
    "we describe the ( by now well - known ) structure of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath10 for bilarge mixing .",
    "the susy model is constructed and the elements of @xmath11 are consistently generated in section 3 ; we also show at the end of this section how fcnc processes , induced at one loop , are suppressed .",
    "the susy parameter space , answering to each of the specific scenarios of normal hierarchy , inverted hierarchy and degenerate neutrinos , is analyzed in section 4 .",
    "we comment on some related possibilities in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains our summary and conclusions .",
    "there is experimental evidence now that neutrinos have tiny masses .",
    "we shall work within the scheme of three light active neutrinos , not including the possibility of an additional light sterile one suggested by the lsnd data till results from the ongoing mini - boone experiment settle the issue .",
    "we shall further assume cpt conservation .",
    "while there is an upper bound @xcite of @xmath12 ev on the sum of neutrino mass eigenvlaues from cosmology , the lack of observation of neutrinoless double beta decay implies an upper bound of @xmath13 ev on the absolute value of the the _ 11_-element of the neutrino mass matrix @xcite . on the other hand , the accumulating data from solar , atmospheric",
    ", accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments persistently point @xcite towards neutrino oscillations .",
    "these data identify favored regions of small but distinct mass - squared separation of the three different physical neutrino states . at the same time",
    ", they also indicate that the mixing between the second and the third families is near maximal , that between the first and the second is large , while the one between the first and the third families is restricted to a small angle . in perfect analogy with the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix in the quark sector",
    ", the three - flavour neutrino mixing matrix can be parameterized as @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 being family indices which run from 1 to 3 ( majorana phases have been neglected here ) .",
    "we work in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonalized .",
    "while solar ( reactor ) neutrino ( antineutrino ) studies suggest that @xmath18 @xcite , the atmospheric neutrino deficit needs @xmath19 to be @xmath20 @xcite and data from reactors require that @xmath21 @xcite",
    ". thus a pattern of bilarge mixing emerges .",
    "the above pattern allows one to construct a candidate neutrino mass matrix in terms of the mass eigenvalues @xmath22 . to start with ,",
    "let us take @xmath23 and @xmath24 approximately , keeping @xmath25 free to be large .",
    "then the corresponding transformation matrix can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the neutrino majorana mass matrix in the flavor basis can now be obtained by transforming the diagonal matrix with the above : @xmath29 thus we see that the requirement of bilarge mixing commits one to a particular structure of the mass matrix where , of course , the relative magnitudes of the entries depend on the eigenvalues . for more precise",
    "information one has to take up the specific scenario of normal / inverted hierarchy or that of degenerate neutrinos . in our study , we attempt to link the diagonal and off - diagonal mass terms of @xmath10 to the parameters of the susy model at high scale and see what the different scenarios tell us about the model parameters themselves .",
    "the model that we adopt is motivated by a number of recent works  @xcite . in  @xcite , for example , a minimal extension of the mssm , including a right - handed neutrino , is used . there",
    "the terms of the effective lagrangian responsible for neutrino masses are @xmath30_d +                  \\left[xlnh_u\\right]_f\\right ) + { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is planck scale and coupling coefficients of order unity have been suppressed . in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the chiral field @xmath31 can acquire both susy violating and susy conserving vevs  @xcite .",
    "the above terms can be responsible for seesaw masses of order @xmath32 for the neutrinos ( recalling the need to have @xmath33 , to ensure the generation of other superparticle masses in the tev range ) .",
    "in addition , there can be radiative contributions to the mass matrix from @xmath0 sneutrino mass terms after susy breaking .",
    "these can arise with the help of a term @xmath34_d$ ] , making contributions that can dominate over seesaw masses in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "we aim to explain the bilarge mixing pattern of neutrinos by extending such a model . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the basic philosophy is to envision some feature of neutrinos , which has no counterpart in the quark sector , as being responsible for the observed bilarge mixing .",
    "there are two features of this kind in such a model : ( a ) the right - chiral neutrino sector and ( b ) the corresponding right - chiral sneutrino sector , with provisions of @xmath0 terms in each . in our approach , each of these sectors is attributed with a @xmath35 mass matrix structure which plays a crucial role in the contribution to the radiative as well as seesaw mass terms .",
    "moreover , we postulate an array of gauge singlet chiral superfields @xmath36 . following these propositions ,",
    "eq.(4 ) is generalized to @xmath37_d +                  \\left[x_{ij}l^in^jh_u\\right]_f\\right ) + { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where there is a summation over flavor ( i.e. generation ) indices @xmath17 .",
    "the choice of the above lagrangian can be motivated by a global symmetry @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath39 helps in solving the @xmath9-problem , and keeps the spontaneous susy breaking scale @xmath40 low enough for the superparticle spectrum in the observable sector to be around tev energies . the summation over family indices in eq .",
    "( 5 ) can be justified by the global symmetry @xmath41 .",
    "this essentially means that the hidden sector chiral superfields @xmath36 interact with those of the visible sector with such a global symmetry and that the low - energy flavour structure is the artifact of such interactions . in case",
    "the @xmath36 s acquire susy violating vevs , then different soft susy breaking terms will arise from the nonrenormalizable interactions shown in eq .",
    "( 5 ) and other higher dimension terms compatible with all symmetries of the theory .",
    "these arise in addition to the soft terms that have analogues in the squark sector .",
    "schematic expressions can be written for the neutrino and sneutrino mass terms , thus obtained , and for the soft susy breaking a - terms as well as for the corresponding terms in the susy lagrangian leading to them .",
    "they are obtainable from the following realizations .",

    "the above expressions are up to unknown multiplicative factors occurring in the susy lagrangian .",
    "it is also assumed that the dirac mass matrix , generated by canonical yukawa couplings ( as in the quark sector ) arising from renormalizable terms in the superpotential , has very small off - diagonal elements .",
    "also , in addition to the @xmath0 mass terms shown above , there may be l - conserving mass terms for right - chiral sneutrinos as a result of soft susy breaking .",
    "nondiagonal a - terms can potentially contribute to fcnc processes such as @xmath47 and hence need to be suppressed .",
    "therefore , we wish to have a structure where @xmath48 vanishes for @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "contributions to off - diagonal terms in the neutrino mass matrix are essential for bilarge mixing .",
    "such terms will be made to arise from seesaw as well as radiative processes . as we shall show below ,",
    "both of these are driven by the vevs of the scalar components of the x - superfields .",
    "we must therefore have nonzero @xmath50 for @xmath49 .",
    "thus we require nonrenormalizable terms in the superpotential involving the chiral superfields @xmath36 , with a rather interesting complementarity between the diagonal and nondiagonal elements of the array .",
    "the diagonal ones can have nonvanishing f - term vevs and thus can generate a diagonal a - matrix , whereas the off - diagonal elements must have vanishing f - term vevs , though the corresponding scalar vevs must be nonvanishing .",
    "a superpotential , in which the above characteristics can be achieved , is presented below .",
    "it was noticed in the previous subsection that bosonic components of the array of chiral superfields @xmath36 should acquire susy violating and susy conserving vevs in a complementary manner to be able to generate the required neutrino masses and mixing pattern . in order to achieve this ,",
    "we first demonstrate a simple situation in which the auxiliary and the scalar components of a single chiral superfield acquire susy violating and susy conserving vevs respectively .",
    "thereafter we generalize this to an array of such superfields @xmath36 .",
    "consider a set of hidden sector fields , for which the superpotential is of the form @xcite @xmath51 here the @xmath52-charge for the chiral field @xmath31 is @xmath53 , while the @xmath52-charges of the remaining chiral fields can be chosen so that @xmath54 has @xmath52-charge 2 .",
    "the explicit assignment of @xmath52-charges will be shown after generalizing this to an array @xmath36 .",

    "the generation of off - diagonal entries in the neutrino majorana mass matrix via nondiagonal @xmath85 is ensured by this potential . on the other hand ,",
    "we have secured a diagonal form for @xmath48 , thus suppressing contributions to fcnc processes from a - terms .",
    "this interesting complementarity is achieved rather naturally by postulating in the superpotential the presence of some mass parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 and their relative hierarchies .",

    "the actual suppression of fcnc processes will be demonstrated in further detail in a later subsection .",
    "schematic expressions for neutrino and sneutrino mass terms , induced in this scenario , have already been shown .",

    "the uncertainty in @xmath110 caused by running down to the electroweak scale can be absorbed in @xmath111 and @xmath112 , since we are concerned with only the _ orders of magnitude _ of the latter .",

    "the interesting point to note here is that @xmath126 has no specified lower limit in this scenario . as a result , the allowed regions in the parameter space are much wider and less fine - tuned compared to the normal hierarchy scenario .",
    "our conclusion , therefore , is that the inverted hierarchy scenario allows a larger flexibility of high - scale parameter combinations in the scheme adopted here",

    "therefore , we have plotted @xmath168 against @xmath143 for @xmath125 ranging from 0.1 ev to @xmath125 = 0.3 ev , showing the allowed range as shaded area .",
    "this is shown in figure 5(a ) with the usual constraints on @xmath112 coming from @xmath103 . in figure 5(b ) , the allowed region in the @xmath103 @xmath119 @xmath143 plane is shown with @xmath126 ranging between 0.1 ev and 0.3 ev .     plane . the right panel shows the variation of the susy mass scale @xmath103 against @xmath143 in the allowed range of @xmath126.,title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=288 ] .1 cm   plane .",
    "the right panel shows the variation of the susy mass scale @xmath103 against @xmath143 in the allowed range of @xmath126.,title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=288 ]      after analyzing these three cases , we can compare their impact on the parameters of our proposed model vis - a - vis the same on other similar models put forward in the literature .",
    "in the model considered in @xcite , for example , there is effectively one parameter which is @xmath169 .",
    "this is because just one right - chiral neutrino was considered there .",
    "that is why , despite the occurrence of both seesaw and radiative masses , the former are negligibly small in magnitude as compared to the latter .",
    "we have a more general ( and natural ) picture with three right - chiral neutrino superfields .",
    "there are consequently three unconnected parameters @xmath170 and @xmath158 .",
    "these give us more freedom enabling us to treat the seesaw and the radiative masses on the same footing .",
    "the plots shown above for the three different neutrino mass cases imply that the different parameters which enter are in the expected range , thereby demonstrating the self - consistency of our model .",
    "it should be noted that the susy breaking scale @xmath103 is related to @xmath112 by the relation @xmath171 , and that they are not entirely independent .",
    "the results presented in figures 3@xmath1195 confirm that such a dependence is consistent with the requirement of neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "some additional constraints may be required ; for example , for @xmath103 on the higher side , one may be restricted to relatively larger values of @xmath112 .",
    "however , it is impossible to be more exact in the absence of precise knowledge of the coupling strengths and other numerical factors in the hidden sector .",
    "naively , eq . ( 31 ) is consistent with @xmath171 for @xmath126 in the range .01 @xmath119 .1 ev .",
    "this , in principle , restricts the inverted hierarchy scenario a little bit , although it is difficult to be very precise , for reasons already mentioned .",
    "it is clear from the expression of eq .",
    "( 30 ) for @xmath103 that our model connects very light neutrinos to tev - scale massive particles .",
    "the latter include superparticles such as neutralinos and sneutrinos as well as right - chiral neutrinos .",
    "further experimental information on neutrino masses , specifically the fixation of the hierarchy scenario , will therefore enable us to indirectly probe such yet undiscovered particles .",
    "at the same time , we have guidelines concerning the susy breaking sectors , especially the non - renormalizable terms that may have other ramifications such as explaining the worrisome @xmath9-problem .",
    "in this section we briefly comment on two other representative scenarios where nonrenormalizable interactions may be invoked to explain the observed pattern in the neutrino sector .",
    "we emphasize , however , that none of these has any bearing on the conclusions presented in the last two sections .",
    "we include these remarks mainly for the sake of completeness .",
    "in @xmath172 we presented a superpotential which led us to diagonal a - terms and the consequent suppression of fcnc effects .",
    "this requires nonvanishing f - component vevs only for the diagonal elements of the array of superfields @xmath36 ; the nondiagonal members of the array should have vevs of the scalar components only , in order to generate off - diagonal elements of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "one may be curious to ask whether , for the diagonal elements @xmath173 , one can have nonvanishing vevs for both the scalar and the auxiliary components and if such be the case , what their implications should be .",
    "there are some models based on polonyi fields in which susy breaking has been achieved with a vanishing cosmological constant  @xcite . in these supergravity - inspired models , on integrating out some additional chiral quark fields at a scale @xmath174 , an effective superpotential @xmath175 is obtained at a scale below @xmath174 . here",
    "@xmath176 is a constant @xmath177(1 ) and @xmath178 is a polonyi superfield .",
    "the scalar potential constructed therefrom yields @xmath179 . at the same time , supergravity effects lift the flatness of the direction @xmath180 so that both the scalar and auxiliary components of the chiral superfield @xmath178 have nonvanishing vevs .",
    "though one has in the past appealed to such models  @xcite , they do pose some difficulties in our case .",
    "a superpotential of the above kind can not be used for off - diagonal elements of @xmath36 , since those would generate large @xmath181 s for @xmath182 and threaten to enhance fcnc rates .",
    "thus the superpotentials for the diagonal and off - diagonal members would look very different in such a case , thereby raising doubts about the legitimacy of using the components of @xmath36 as fields of a similar type .",
    "what we have done , on the other hand , does not raise such questions , since the complementarity of @xmath111 and @xmath48 is decided essentially by the relative magnitudes of two sets of mass parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath183 ) of the same order , where some fluctuation is quite natural .",
    "another possibility  @xcite lies in considering the effective susy lagrangian @xmath184_f + { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] having one right - chiral neutrino to explain tiny neutrino masses .",
    "( 39 ) can be readily generalized to include three right - chiral neutrinos , i.e. @xmath185_f + { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where there is a summation over the flavor indices @xmath17 and @xmath186 are yukawa couplings .",
    "the kronecker @xmath187 in the second term is to suppress fcnc processes .",
    "this lagrangian can be justified on the basis of the global symmetry @xmath38 , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 . for susy breaking , consider the hidden sector superpotential @xmath190 where @xmath191 the charges for various fields under @xmath39 in this case are : @xmath192 the minimization of the scalar potential , arising from this superpotential , yields @xmath193 for all @xmath17 .",
    "after susy breaking , dirac and right - handed neutrino masses are generated as @xmath194_{ij } = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}}\\lambda_i\\delta_{ij } , \\qquad   [ m_r]_{ij } = \\bra x_{ij}\\ket.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the seesaw mass is @xmath195 for @xmath196 gev and @xmath197 0.01 , we obtain neutrino masses @xmath198 0.1 ev . following the analysis given in the earlier sections , we can explain the observed bilarge neutrino mixing as well as different hierarchies in some parameter space of @xmath111 .",
    "however , no connection can be made in this scenario between the tiny neutrino masses and the tev - scale particles of mssm .",
    "this is since only @xmath199 enters the game and no @xmath200 .",
    "moreover , a global symmetry of the form @xmath201 does not allow the triple-@xmath31 higher order term which can generate the @xmath0 sneutrino mass , cf .",
    "( 9 ) , in this particular model .",
    "thus there can be no radiative contribution , at least not in the lowest orders .",
    "so one is unable to use here the full potential of such a scenario which , in our case , has meant a considerable widening of the parameter space through an interplay of seesaw and radiative effects , making our model more accommodating and natural .",
    "with a broken supersymmetric theory , we have considered a general scenario where the neutrino mass matrix is constructed through a combination of the seesaw mechanism and radiative effects .",
    "all the agents behind the mechanism for this generation come from ( a ) a sector containing nonrenormalizable interactions in the superpotential and ( b ) lepton - number violating terms .",
    "we have used an array of gauge singlet chiral superfields @xmath36 for this purpose . in terms of these , we have constructed a superpotential which allows both the above types of contributions , while ensuring fcnc suppression .",
    "right - chiral sneutrinos are found to have as much of a role in the process as the corresponding neutrinos .",
    "it should be noted that the angle @xmath202 vanishes on using the bilarge mixing matrix in equation 2 .",
    "a small but nonvanishing value of @xmath202 requires one to modify equations ( 24)@xmath119(29 ) , although no quatitative change in the conclusions is expected .",
    "we have then taken in turn the neutrino mass scenarios of normal hierarchy , inverted hierarchy and degenerate neutrinos . using the masses answering to each scenario ,",
    "we have traced out the allowed region of the parameter space of the involved high - scale physics , given in terms of the relevant vevs of the scalar and auxiliary components of the superfields @xmath36 .",
    "numerically , these are seen to allow a self - consistent region of the parameter space .",
    "while the scenario of normal hierarchy ( and , partly , that of degenerate neutrinos ) forces us into somewhat fine - tuned zones of the parameter space , the inverted hierarchy picture allows a considerably larger region . with forthcoming laboratory measurements and cosmological observations hopefully deciding among the above mass patterns , connecting experimental observables to high - scale physics may become a realistic proposition , especially if nature indeed proves to be supersymmetric .",
