    "this paper is dedicated , with great affection and admiration , to bla bollobs on the occasion of his 60th birthday .",
    "two of us ( c.b . and j.t.c . ) are privileged to count bla among our dearest friends . and",
    "all of us have been inspired by his pioneering work on graph processes in general , and scale - free graphs in particular .",
    "we use the opportunity of this birthday volume to provide complete proofs of results on a new graph model , first announced in  @xcite .",
    "there is currently tremendous interest in understanding the mathematical structure of networks  especially as we discover the pervasiveness of network structures in natural and engineered systems .",
    "much recent theoretical work has been motivated by measurements of real - world networks , indicating they have certain `` scale - free '' properties , such as a power - law distribution of degrees .",
    "for the internet graph , in particular , both the graph of routers and the graph of autonomous systems ( as ) seem to obey power laws @xcite . however , these observed power laws hold only for a limited range of degrees , presumably due to physical constraints and the finite size of the internet .",
    "many random network growth models have been proposed which give rise to power - law degree distributions .",
    "most of these models rely on a small number of basic mechanisms , mainly preferential attachment @xcite or copying @xcite , extending ideas known for many years @xcite to a network context .",
    "variants of the basic preferential attachment mechanism have also been proposed , and some of these lead to changes in the values of the exponents in the resulting power laws . for extensive reviews of work in this area ,",
    "see albert and barabsi @xcite , dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite , and newman @xcite ; for a survey of the relatively limited amount of mathematical work see @xcite .",
    "most of this work concerns network models without reference to an underlying geometric space . nor do most of these models allow for heterogeneity of nodes , or address physical constraints on the capacity of the nodes .",
    "thus , while such models may be quite appropriate for geometry - free networks , such as the web graph , they do not seem to be ideally suited to the description of other observed networks , _",
    "e.g. _ , the internet graph .    in this paper , instead of assuming preferential attachment",
    ", we show that it can arise from a more basic underlying process , namely competition between opposing forces . the idea that power laws can arise from competing effects , modeled as the solution of optimization problems with complex objectives ,",
    "was proposed originally by carlson and doyle @xcite .",
    "their `` highly optimized tolerance '' ( hot ) framework has reliable design as a primary objective .",
    "fabrikant , koutsoupias and papadimitriou ( fkp ) @xcite introduce an elegant network growth model with such a mechanism , which they called `` heuristically optimized trade - offs '' .",
    "as in many growth models , the fkp network is grown one node at a time , with each new node choosing a previous node to which it connects . however , in contrast to the standard preferential attachment types of models , a key feature of the fkp model is the underlying geometry .",
    "the nodes are points chosen uniformly at random from some region , for example a unit square in the plane .",
    "the trade - off is between the geometric consideration that it is desirable to connect to a nearby point , and a networking consideration , that it is desirable to connect to a node that is `` central '' in the network as a graph .",
    "centrality is measured by using , for example , the graph distance to the initial node .",
    "the model has a tunable , but fixed , parameter , which determines the relative weights given to the geometric distance and the graph distance .",
    "the suggestion that competition between two metrics could be an alternative to preferential attachment for generating power - law degree distributions represents an important paradigm shift .",
    "though fkp introduced this paradigm for network growth , and fkp networks have many interesting properties , the resulting distribution is not a power law in the standard sense @xcite . instead the overwhelming majority of the nodes are leaves ( degree one ) , and a second substantial fraction heavily connected `` stars '' ( hubs ) , producing a node degree distribution which has clear bimodal features .    here , instead of directly producing power laws as a consequence of competition between metrics ,",
    "we show that such competition can give rise to a preferential attachment mechanism , which in turn gives rise to power laws . moreover , the power laws we generate have an upper cutoff , which is more realistic in the context of many applications .",
    "we begin by formulating a general competition model for network growth .",
    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of random variables with values in some space @xmath1 .",
    "we think of the points @xmath2 arriving one at a time according to some stochastic process .",
    "for example , we typically take @xmath1 to be a compact subset of @xmath3 , @xmath4 to be a given point , say the origin , and @xmath5 to be i.i.d . uniform on @xmath1 .",
    "the network at time @xmath6 will be represented by a graph , @xmath7 , on @xmath8 vertices , labeled @xmath9 , and at each time step , the new node attaches to one or several nodes in the existing network . for simplicity , here we assume that each new node connects to a single node , resulting in @xmath7 being a tree .",
    "given @xmath10 , the new node , labeled @xmath6 , attaches to that node @xmath11 in the existing network that minimizes a certain cost function representing the trade - off of two competing effects , namely connection or startup cost , and routing or performance cost .",
    "the connection cost is represented by a metric , @xmath12 , on @xmath13 which depends on @xmath14 , but not on the current graph @xmath10 , while the routing cost is represented by a function , @xmath15 , on the nodes which depends on the current graph , but not on the physical locations @xmath16 of the nodes @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to the cost function @xmath18 , \\label{cost}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a constant which determines the relative weighting between connection and routing costs .",
    "we think of the function @xmath15 as measuring the centrality of the node @xmath11 ; for simplicity , we take it to be the hop distance along the graph @xmath10 from @xmath11 to the root @xmath20 .    to simplify the analysis of the random graph process",
    ", we will assume that nodes always choose to connect to a point which is closer to the root , _",
    "i.e. _ , they minimize the cost function @xmath21 , \\label{greedy - cost}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is an appropriate norm .    in the original fkp model , @xmath1 is a compact subset of @xmath23 , say the unit square , and the points @xmath24 are independently uniformly distributed on @xmath1 .",
    "the cost function is of the form , with @xmath25 , the euclidean metric ( modeling the cost of building the physical transmission line ) , and @xmath26 is the hop distance along the existing network @xmath7 from @xmath11 to the root . a rigorous analysis of the degree distribution of this two - dimensional model was given in @xcite , and the analogous one - dimensional problem was treated in @xcite .",
    "our model is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath27 , and let @xmath28 be i.i.d .",
    ", uniformly at random in the unit interval @xmath29 $ ] , and let @xmath7 be the following process : at @xmath30 , @xmath7 consists of a single vertex @xmath20 , the root .",
    "let @xmath26 be the hop distance to @xmath20 along @xmath7 , and let @xmath31 be the number of existing nodes between @xmath24 and @xmath32 at time @xmath6 , which we refer to as the _ jump cost _ of @xmath33 connecting to @xmath11 .",
    "given @xmath10 at time @xmath34 , a new vertex , labeled @xmath6 , attaches to the node @xmath11 which minimizes the cost function .",
    "furthermore , if there are several nodes @xmath11 that minimize this cost function and satisfy the constraint , we choose the one whose position @xmath32 is nearest to @xmath35 .",
    "the process so defined is called the _ border toll optimization process ( btop)_.    as in the fkp model , the routing cost is just the hop distance to the root along the existing network . however , in our model the connection cost metric measures the number of `` borders '' between two nodes : hence the name btop .",
    "note the correspondence to the internet , where the principal connection cost is related to the number of as domains crossed  representing , _",
    "e.g. _ , the overhead associated with bgp , monetary costs of peering agreements , etc . in order to facilitate a rigorous analysis of our model",
    ", we took the simpler cost function , so that the new node always attaches to a node to its left .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ratio of the btop connection cost metric to that of the one - dimensional fkp model is just the local density of nodes : @xmath36 .",
    "thus the transformation between the two models is equivalent to replacing the constant parameter @xmath19 in the fkp model with a variable parameter @xmath37 which changes as the network evolves in time . that @xmath38 is proportional to the local density of nodes in the network reflects a model with an increase in cost for local resources that are scarce or in high demand",
    "alternatively , it can be thought of as reflecting the economic advantages of being first to market .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the btop is equivalent to a special case of the following process , which closely parallels the preferential attachment model and makes no reference to any underlying geometry .",
    "[ def : cipa ] let @xmath39 be two positive integer - valued parameters .",
    "let @xmath7 be the following markov process , whose states are finite rooted trees in which each node is labeled either _ fertile _ or",
    "_ infertile_. at time @xmath30 , @xmath7 consists of a single fertile vertex .",
    "given the graph at time @xmath6 , the new graph is formed in two steps : first , a new vertex , labeled @xmath8 and initialized as infertile , connects to an old vertex @xmath11 with probability zero if @xmath11 is infertile , and with probability @xmath40 if @xmath11 is fertile .",
    "here , @xmath41 is equal to @xmath42 plus the out - degree of @xmath11 , and @xmath43 with the sum running over fertile vertices only .",
    "we refer to vertex @xmath8 as a child of @xmath11 . if after the first step , @xmath11 has more than @xmath44 infertile children , one of them , chosen uniformly at random , becomes fertile .",
    "the process so defined is called a _ generalized preferential attachment process with fertility threshold @xmath45 and aging threshold @xmath46 . _",
    "the special case @xmath47 is called the _ competition - induced preferential attachment process _ with parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the last definition is motivated by the following theorem , to be proved in section  [ sec : themodel ] . to state the theorem",
    ", we define a graph process as a random sequence of graphs @xmath48 on the vertex sets @xmath49 respectively .",
    "[ thm : equiv ] as a graph process , the border toll optimization process has the same distribution as the competition - induced preferential attachment process with parameter @xmath50 .",
    "certain other limiting cases of the generalized preferential attachment process are worth noting . if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we recover the standard model of preferential attachment as considered in @xcite . if @xmath51 and @xmath46 is finite , the model is equivalent to the standard model of preferential attachment with a cutoff . on the other hand , if @xmath53 , we get a uniform attachment model .",
    "the degree distribution of our random trees is characterized by the following theorem , which asserts that almost surely ( a.s . ) the fraction of vertices having degree @xmath54 converges to a specified limit @xmath55 , and moreover that this limit obeys a power law for @xmath56 , and decays exponentially above @xmath46 .",

    "note that for measurements of the internet the value of the exponent for the power law is @xmath74 . in our border toll optimization model , where @xmath75 , we recover @xmath76 .",
    "the convergence claim of theorem  [ thm : main - thm ] is proved using a novel method which we believe is one of the main technical contributions of this work . for preferential attachment models which have been analyzed in the past  @xcite ,",
    "the convergence was established using the azuma - hoeffding martingale inequality . to establish the bounded - differences hypothesis required by that inequality ,",
    "those proofs employed a clever coupling of the random decisions made by the various edges , such that the decisions made by an edge @xmath77 only influence the decisions of subsequent edges which choose to imitate @xmath77 s choices .",
    "a consequence of this coupling is that if @xmath77 made a different decision , it would alter the degrees of only finitely many vertices .",
    "this in turn allows the required bounded - differences hypothesis to be established .",
    "no such approach is available for our models , because the coupling fails .",
    "the random decisions made by an edge @xmath77 may influence the time at which some node @xmath78 crosses the fertility or aging threshold , which thereby exerts a subtle influence on the decisions of _ every _ future edge , not only those which choose to imitate @xmath77 .",
    "instead we introduce a new approach based on the second - moment method . the argument establishing the requisite second - moment upper bound",
    "is quite subtle ; it depends on a computation involving the eigenvalues of a matrix describing the evolution of the degree sequence in a continuous - time version of the model .",
    "in this section we will turn to the btop defined in the introduction , establishing some basic properties which will enable us to prove that it is equivalent to the competition - induced preferential attachment model . in order to avoid complications we exclude the case that some of the @xmath24 s are identical , an event that has probability zero .",
    "we say that @xmath79 lies to the right of @xmath80 if @xmath81 , and we say that @xmath11 lies directly to the right of @xmath33 if @xmath81 but there is no @xmath82 such that @xmath83 . in a similar way , we say that @xmath11 is the first vertex with a certain property to the right of @xmath33 if @xmath11 has that property and there exists no @xmath82 such that @xmath83 and @xmath54 has the property in question .",
    "similar notions apply with `` left '' in place of `` right '' .",

    "the cost of connecting to an infertile vertex to the left of @xmath33 is even higher , since the hop count of an infertile vertex is at best equal to the hop count of the next fertile vertex to the right .",

    "again , the vertex @xmath113 will prefer @xmath33 over any vertex to the left of @xmath33 ( the cost analysis is the same as the one used for @xmath8 above ) , so we just have to compare the costs of connecting to the different vertices between @xmath33 and @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath93 , this will again imply that @xmath113 connect to @xmath33 ; but if @xmath94 , the vertex @xmath113 will only connect to @xmath33 if it does not fall to the right of the rightmost of the now @xmath114 vertices between @xmath33 and @xmath11 .",
