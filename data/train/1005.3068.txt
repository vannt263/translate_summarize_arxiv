    "coupling between an electromagnetic field and an electronic transition in matter , with coupling stronger than environmental dissipation , has permitted delicate electromagnetic control of electronic states .",
    "this control allows sensitive measurement of unknown environments , such as the extensive use of nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite ( nmr ) as a diagnostic probe , as well as the manipulation of quantum information , such as in the demonstration of atomic teleportation@xcite .",
    "successful efforts in this area have tended to progress from the systems most weakly coupled to the environment ( such as nuclei in nmr ) to more dissipative systems ( such as electron spin resonance in solids , first in insulators , later in metals and semiconductors ) .",
    "however , even though the dissipation is stronger in solids , the coupling is also stronger , suggesting the potential for very rapid exchange of quantum states between light and matter .",
    "recently several examples of strong coupling between a single exciton and a single photon in a semiconductor have been demonstrated , through the mixing of the exciton and photon in photoluminescence@xcite , through rabi oscillations between exciton and photon@xcite , and through optically - induced spin rotation@xcite ( spin ac stark effect ) .",
    "multiply - excited atomic systems coherently interacting with a photon mode exhibit additional unusual phenomena , such as superradiance@xcite . multiply - excited excitonic systems in solids suffer from decoherence due to homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths and long - range frster coupling between different excitonic transitions .",
    "mitigation of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths is possible by coupling the excitons to each other through the coulomb interaction ( excitonic condensate@xcite ) , or indirectly through the cavity mode , in order to form a polariton condensate@xcite .",
    "excitonic condensates associated with finite - energy excitons , however , are challenging to generate , and are not found at room temperature .",
    "strong coupling in multiply - excited systems would therefore benefit from a robust , room - temperature , coherent electronic state whose coupling to the photonic mode can be made larger than its decoherence rate .",
    "ferromagnets are robust room - temperature many - body states that couple directly to light , although the magnetic dipole transitions associated with individual spins couple more weakly to photons than electric dipole transitions ( by a factor of the fine structure constant@xcite ) .",
    "recently it has been pointed out@xcite that the coherent excitation of the ground - state spin of a small ferromagnet ( a nanomagnet ) can be described by a coupling strength orders of magnitude stronger than that of a single excitonic transition .",
    "the locking of the large number of constituent spins by the exchange interaction into a macrospin causes an increase in coupling strength proportional to the square root of the number of exchange - locked spins .",

    ", treating with particular care the dependence on nanomagnet size of the coupling strength between the nanomagnet and the photonic cavity .",
    "we find that , for a specific magnetic material , the coupling strength increases according to the square root of the volume of the nanomagnet ( corresponding to the square root of the total nanomagnet spin ) in the absence of any photons inside the cavity .",
    "however , when the system is driven in the superradiance regime , this coupling strength becomes proportional to the volume ( or total spin ) to the @xmath0 power .",
    "we provide estimates of the coupling strength for nanomagnets in a spherical cavity and compare with the effect of crystalline magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the coupling strengths found are large enough to establish eigenstates involving large numbers of entangled photons and spin orientation states .",
    "these states can be combined to generate coherent oscillations of the spin orientation and photon number . however , for small nanomagnets the crystalline magnetic anisotropy greatly exceeds the nanomagnet - cavity coupling , quenching these coherent oscillations . for large nanomagnets",
    "the macrospin approximation , assumed here , fails and the multiple domains of the nanomagnet separately couple to the cavity .",
    "the effect of using plasmonic techniques to enhance the magnetic field associated with the photonic mode near the nanomagnet is described , which may lead to sub - microsecond oscillation times for coherent multiphoton oscillations in the cavity .",
    "we begin by describing the nanomagnet - cavity system , quantizing the photons of the spherical cavity , and deriving the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "we solve for the eigenstates of the coupled system by mapping the discrete system onto a continuum representation similar to a one - dimensional tight - binding model with a spatially - varying effective mass .",

    "calculations for three different nanomagnet sizes in a photonic cavity indicate that strong - field coupling between photons and spins is possible , and should substantially exceed the coupling observed in solids between orbital transitions and light .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coupled nanomagnet - cavity system is solved in the continuum limit to obtain a coherent state representation of the system around the superradiance regime .",
    "this coherent state is characterized by large oscillations in photon number of the cavity ( or equivalently the total spin number of the nanomagnet ) with exceptionally long dephasing times and is expected to be observable for realistic nanomagnets with radii from @xmath203  nm . approaches to enhance the coupling , such as using a metal tip to enhance the optical field , have been proposed . for",
    "the smallest nanomagnet ( 2  nm radius ) the dispersion caused by crystalline magnetic anisotropy would largely quench the coherent oscillations , but for nanomagnets in the @xmath203  nm radius range the coupling to the cavity is much stronger than the dispersion caused by cma .",
    "the dephasing times increase with increasing nanomagnet size , due to the greater uniformity of the coupling terms between states that differ by one photon and one spin flip .",
    "thus the most coherent nanomagnet - cavity systems will be those that are just under the size threshold where the macrospin approximation ceases to be accurate .",
    "the effects of magnons have been considered and shown to not substantially modify these results .",
    "future work shall investigate how to use the strong coupling features described here to transfer coherently states of the electronic system to the photonic one , and back again .",
    "a particularly interesting direction will be to consider the effect of active nanomagnetic systems , such as those demonstrated to be coherently driven by electrical spin currents@xcite , on the optical state of the cavity .",
    "as phase - locking has been demonstrated between two such oscillators@xcite , mediated perhaps by spin waves , would it be possible to phase - lock them through interaction with a cavity such as the one considered here ?"
