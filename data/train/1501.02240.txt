    "kinetically constrained spin models ( kcms ) are interacting @xmath1-@xmath2 particle systems , on general graphs , which evolve with a simple glauber dynamics described as follows . at every site",

    "however the update at @xmath3 is accepted only if the _ current _ local configuration satisfies a certain constraint , hence the models are `` kinetically constrained '' .",
    "it is always assumed that the constraint at site @xmath3 does not depend on the spin at @xmath3 and therefore the product bernoulli(@xmath4 ) probability measure @xmath8 is the reversible measure .",
    "constraints may require , for example , that a certain _ number _ of the neighbouring spins are in state @xmath1 , or more restrictively , that certain _ preassigned _ neighbouring spins are in state @xmath1 ( e.g. the children of @xmath3 when the underlying graph is a rooted tree ) .",
    "the main interest in the physical literature for kcms ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) stems from the fact that they display many key dynamical features of real glassy materials : ergodicity breaking transition at some critical value @xmath9 , huge relaxation time for @xmath10 close to @xmath9 , dynamic heterogeneity ( non - trivial spatio - temporal fluctuations of the local relaxation to equilibrium ) and aging , just to mention a few .",
    "mathematically , despite their simple definition , kcms pose very challenging and interesting problems because of the hardness of the constraint , with ramifications towards bootstrap percolation problems @xcite , combinatorics @xcite , coalescence processes @xcite and random walks on upper triangular matrices @xcite . some of the mathematical tools developed for the analysis of the relaxation process of kcms @xcite have proved to be quite powerful also in other contexts such as card shuffling problems @xcite and random evolution of surfaces @xcite .    among the kcms ,",
    "the most studied model is the _ east process _ , a one - dimensional spin system that was introduced in the physics literature by jckle and eisinger  @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite and @xcite for a recent mathematical review ) . in this case",
    "the base graph is @xmath11 ( or finite connected subsets of it ) and the constraint at @xmath12 requires that the vertex @xmath13 is empty ( its associated spin is @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is the properties of the east process before and towards reaching equilibrium which are of interest , with the standard gauges for the speed of convergence to stationarity given by the relaxation time @xmath14 ( @xmath15 inverse spectral - gap ) and the total - variation mixing time @xmath16 on a finite interval @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , where we fix @xmath18 for ergodicity .",
    "that @xmath19 means that there exists a constant @xmath20 such that @xmath21 and that @xmath22 . ] in @xmath23 for any @xmath10 small enough was first proved in @xcite and , later on , for all @xmath24 $ ] in @xcite by different methods .",
    "subsequently the analysis of the relaxation time in the physical relevant setting @xmath25 ( corresponding to the low temperature limit ) was developed to a high level of precision in @xcite where the relevant questions of dynamical heterogeneities and time scale separation have been rigorously settled .",
    "the fact that the relaxation time is @xmath26 in @xmath23 implies , in particular , that @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th : mix ] ) .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether the finite volume east process exhibits the _ cutoff phenomenon _ ( coined by aldous and diaconis  @xcite ; see also  @xcite and the references therein ) : over a negligible period of time ( the cutoff window ) the distance from equilibrium drops from near @xmath2 to near @xmath1 . as is easily seen , the cutoff problem is strongly linked to the following _ front progression _ problem for the east process . for a initial configuration @xmath28 with @xmath29 , call this rightmost 0 its _ front _ and denote by @xmath30 its position .",
    "it is easy to verify that at any later time the process starting from @xmath28 will also have a front @xmath31 and the key step to prove cutoff is a detailed analysis of the asymptotic law of @xmath31 as @xmath32 . in @xcite a kind of shape theorem",
    "was proved : as @xmath33 the law of the process behind the front converges to an invariant measure @xmath34 and @xmath35 in probability for a suitable constant @xmath36 . as a consequence @xmath37 . to prove cutoff one has to go beyond the law of large numbers and to control the fluctuations of the front around the mean value @xmath38 . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that the latters obey a clt , and cutoff with the optimal window @xmath39 follows .    in several interesting contributions ( cf . @xcite and references therein )",
    "a natural generalization of the east dynamics to higher dimensions @xmath40 , in the sequel referred to as the _ east - like _ process , appears to play a key role in _ realistic _ models of glass formers . in @xmath41",
    "the east - like process evolves similarly to the east process but now the kinetic constraint requires that the south _ or _",
    "west neighbor of the updating vertex contains _ at least _",
    "one vacancy ( a zero spin ) .",
    "in general @xmath42 can flip if @xmath43 for some @xmath44 in the canonical basis of @xmath45 .",
    "in @xcite the authors thoroughly analyzed the east - like process with emphasis on its low temperature ( small @xmath10 ) behavior . among the main results",
    "it was proved that the process on @xmath45 is ergodic with a finite relaxation time @xmath46 and that , as @xmath25 , @xmath47 , correcting in this way some heuristic conjectures which appeared in the physical literature . in finite volume with ergodic boundary conditions ( see section [ sec : fin - vol ] below ) the asymptotics of the relaxation time as @xmath25 was also computed quite precisely and it was shown to depend very strongly on the choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "finally the asymptotics as @xmath25 of the _ persistence times _ ( see section [ sec : persistence - time ] below ) was also established but only up to a spatial scale @xmath48 .",
    "other natural questions concerning the genuine _ out - of - equilibrium _ behavior of the east - like process , for example the convergence as @xmath32 of the particle density to the equilibrium value @xmath4 for a general class of initial laws or the asymptotics as @xmath49 of the mixing time @xmath16 in a box of side @xmath23 remained open .    in this paper",
    "we fill this gap in the spirit of similar results for the east process @xcite . in section 4 ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th:1 ] and corollary [ cor:1 ] ) , using key results from section 3 , we prove a form of _ local exponential ergodicity _ together with the above mentioned convergence of the particle density . in the same section",
    "we also prove an exponential tail for the law of the persistence time of a given vertex ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th:2 ] ) , a key step for our final main result , namely that the mixing time in a finite box grows linearly in the side of the box ( cf .",
