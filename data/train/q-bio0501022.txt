    "traditional theoretical ecology , in which the time evolution of population densities is described by differential equations , has a long history @xcite . for a single species the simplest form of the governing equation",
    "is assumed to take the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 describes the growth of the population .",
    "a common choice when modeling this growth is to take @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two constants . by analogy ,",
    "when describing the interaction of two species , it is natural to postulate that the populations of the two species , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , change according to @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are chosen according to whether the interactions are purely competitive , predator - prey like or include other effects such as co - operation .",
    "we will refer to descriptions of this kind as population - based ; they are arrived at without the need for a detailed knowledge of the interaction between individuals and rely instead on assuming that the terms which arise in the governing equations represent the net effects of individual interactions in some generic way .",
    "equations of this kind play such a central role in population biology , that many subsequent elaborations of the theory have taken them as the starting point : spatial variation is introduced by adding a drift term @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) to the right - hand side of the @xmath13th equation , and the models are sometimes interpreted as referring to individuals by assuming that the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 also describe interactions at the level of the individual .    in the last decade or so ,",
    "an alternative approach to that of classical theoretical ecology described above has been developed .",
    "this involves abandoning the traditional population - level description in favor of an individual - based description in which explicit rules governing the interaction of individuals with each other and with the environment are given .",
    "the popularity of these individual - based models ( ibms ) is undoubtedly due to the continuing increase in the availability of powerful computers , but they also have other attractive features , such as the ability to directly model individual attributes . at this point",
    "we should stress we are assuming that the individuals of a given species in our model are identical , and thus the term ibm should not be confused with agent based models which are often designed to study the ecological effects of behavioral and physiological variation among individuals .",
    "a better term might be ilm ( individual level model ) , but the term ibm has wide usage , and so we will use it here . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with theoretical issues which relate to the connection between models defined at the individual level and those at the population level .",
    "thus , the individuals in our models will be identical within a given species .",
    "the relation between population - level and individual - level descriptions has been a focus of discussion within the theoretical ecology community for some time @xcite .",
    "some regard the nature of the population - based models as obvious and either write them down without comment , or derive mean - field equations by making an assumption of homogeneous mixing of the populations @xcite . however , there is also some recognition that the situation may be more complicated than this @xcite , and that the transition to a partial differential equation required for a spatial description , from the ordinary differential equation obtained by using mean - field theory , may not be as simple as just adding the term @xmath11 @xcite .    from a statistical physics perspective",
    "it is natural to expect that fluctuations may play an important role in these systems and lead to important differences between microscopic ( ibm ) and macroscopic ( population - level ) descriptions .",
    "a formal analysis of such issues has been presented for simple birth / death processes @xcite , and annihilation reactions @xcite using the language of field theory and the renormalization group . here , we take a different approach , using van kampen s system size expansion , in order to probe the connection between more complex ibm s and mean field theories .",
    "this has some advantages , for instance it is not necessary using this technique to first construct a corresponding field theory , and then extract the mean - field equations and the gaussian fluctuations about them to model the macroscopic behavior .",
    "there is also less of an emphasis of the role of phase transitions , which are not usually of prime interest in ecological models .",
    "we would like to stress from the outset that our use of `` mean field theory '' or `` mean field model '' is in the spirit of statistical mechanics .",
    "by `` mean field '' we mean the neglect of correlations between degrees of freedom , allowing one to write the mean of the product of two stochastic variables as the product of their means .",
    "thus , a spatial model in which statistical correlations are neglected is still a `` mean field model '' within this usage .",
    "this is in contrast to some papers in population biology in which `` mean field '' is reserved exclusively to describe non - spatial models .    in this paper ,",
    "the models which we study will be defined only at the level of direct interaction among individuals and in terms of local properties such as birth , death and migration rates .",
    "the population - based properties of the model will then be derived within a well - defined approximation scheme .",
    "we will show that , beginning with reasonable models at the individual level , the corresponding population - level models are similar in structure to those that we would naively write down , but have important differences . for instance , small scale diffusion may not simply translate into @xmath11 terms and the parameters defined at the individual - based level may not map directly into their equivalents at the population level .",
    "the individual interactions may be naturally introduced using a `` patch model . '' from a biological perspective , a patch can be thought of as a small spatial region within which interactions between individuals occur .",
    "the patch is assumed to be sufficiently small that there are no spatial effects .",
    "in other words , there is complete mixing , and all individuals have the same chance of potentially interacting with each other . in the non - spatial version of the model",
    "this simply amounts to stating that the probability of any individual dying in unit time should be proportional to the density of individuals existing at that time , and for processes which involve two individuals , the probability involved should be that found when drawing two of these types of individuals at random from a patch which contains all the individuals in the system .",
    "not all constituents of the patch will correspond to individuals ; some will correspond to empty sites in the spatial version of the model .",
    "a more detailed specification is given in section [ basic ] .",
    "patch models such as this have been used in many areas of science @xcite , and often go under the name of `` urn models . ''",
    "two early examples were the ehrenfest urn , which was used to discuss the foundations of statistical mechanics , and the plya urn , which was originally devised to describe contagious diseases @xcite . in both cases",
    "the problem of interest can be mapped onto an urn which contains balls of different colors , say black and white , which are drawn randomly one at a time . in the case of the ehrenfest urn , each time a ball is drawn it is replaced by one of the other color . for the plya urn",
    ", the chosen ball is replaced together with an extra ball of the same color .",
    "the relation to the modeling of contagious diseases should be clear : each occurrence of a particular color increases the probability of further occurrences . since the introduction of these particular urn models , the notion has been generalized considerably .",
    "for example , both models fall into the class of urn models which have the properties that if a white ball is drawn , it is replaced together with @xmath14 white balls and @xmath15 black ones , and if a black ball is drawn , it is replaced together with @xmath16 white balls and @xmath17 black ones .",
    "a further generalization is to consider @xmath3 different colors , with the drawn ball of color @xmath18 being replaced together with @xmath19 balls of color @xmath20(@xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that two , or more , balls can be drawn together or , as we will have occasion to assume in this paper , two balls could be drawn for a fraction @xmath22 of the time and one ball for a fraction @xmath23 of the time .",
    "urn models are concrete realizations of stochastic processes with probabilities which depend only on the instantaneous state of the system , that is , markov processes .",
    "they have proved useful in several areas of the biological sciences .",
    "perhaps the most obvious application is in population genetics ; implicitly in the early work of fisher and wright @xcite , and explicitly in later developments @xcite .",
    "however they have also been used in a number of other areas such as the study of radioactive particles in animals @xcite , the study of patterns of vegetation @xcite , models of interaction between species @xcite and metapopulation models @xcite .",
    "the last three applications are closest to the ones discussed in this paper , but differ in that the balls represent forest or grassland in the first case , species in the second case and colonies in the third case , rather than individuals as in the present paper .",
    "since urn , or patch , models are representations of markov processes , the continuous time version of their dynamics may be described using a master equation .",
    "the use of master equations is familiar to physicists , but they are still not widely appreciated in the biological community ( but see above references and refs .",
    "@xcite , for instance ) .",
    "once the process has been formulated in this way , we may use standard techniques to take the mean field limit and so obtain the corresponding population - based equation .",
    "much of this paper will be taken up with a comparison of results obtained from the full model ( averaged over many realizations ) and the mean - field results .",
    "our approach will be particularly useful in distinguishing situations where mean - field theory is a good approximation to the full theory and situations where it is not .",
    "we will mainly concentrate on competitive interactions in systems with one or two species , but our method applies equally well to predator - prey or epidemic models and multispecies communities .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first motivate and define the rules for the non - spatial patch models in section [ basic ] , starting with a single species model , and then generalizing to a two - species competition model .",
    "the full stochastic nature of the models is described using master equations , and the associated mean field models are derived . in the following section we go one step beyond mean field theory and derive the dynamics of the gaussian fluctuations about the mean field solutions .",
    "this is equivalent to not only following the mean position of the probability distributions over time , but also describing their broadening . in section [ sim_nonspatial ]",
    "we present numerical simulations of the fully stochastic non - spatial models , for both one and two species .",
    "we compare our results to numerical integration of both the mean field equations , and the improved models with gaussian fluctuations included .",
    "we find that the agreement between mean field theory and simulations is excellent for larger patches , as is to be expected , but that the breakdown of mean field theory occurs precipitously below critical patch sizes which are still fairly large .",
    "we proceed in section [ spatial ] to generalize our patch model formulation to spatially explicit population dynamics of two species competition . from the master equation",
    "we derive the spatial mean field equations .",
    "we note important differences between these equations and `` intuitive '' versions which have appeared in the literature .",
    "these mean field equations are tested against simulations of the fully stochastic models in section [ sim_spatial ] . in this introductory paper",
    "we are unable to give a comprehensive analysis of the two species model .",
    "instead we present two interesting scenarios , and note the successes and failures of the mean field equations , which are strongly dependent on patch size and the presence / absence of interspecific competition .",
    "we end the paper with our conclusions along with a discussion of future directions .",
    "two appendices contain technical details .",
    "the first concerns the system size expansion for two species and the second the formalism for spatial systems .",
    "in this section we will introduce the essential features of our approach by formulating an individual based stochastic model of competition between two species .",
    "we will then show that in the limit of large population sizes , the time evolution of this model reduces to the well known differential equations describing the population growth of two competing species .",
    "the two species will be labeled @xmath24 and @xmath25 . to motivate the approach",
    "we will adopt , suppose that we model the interactions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 individuals in an area of land by subdividing it into @xmath26 plots of equal area .",
    "the plot sizes are chosen so that each one either contains one @xmath24 individual , or one @xmath25 individual , or neither an @xmath24 nor a @xmath25 .",
    "we will call the latter an empty site and label it by @xmath27 . in a spatial version of the model we would give rules for how @xmath28 and @xmath27 interact , specify birth and death rates for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and allow them to move to nearest neighbor sites . in later sections",
    "we will describe such a model , but we will begin , for simplicity , by ignoring the spatial aspects .",
    "we do this by imagining that we pluck all the @xmath29 and @xmath27 from their particular sites and put them into a single large patch , with no record of their original spatial locations .",
    "any memory of which individuals were nearest neighbors is now lost , and any two individuals picked at random are just as likely to interact as any other two similar individuals picked at random .",
    "in fact the time evolution of the spatial model which would read : pick a site at random , then pick a nearest neighbor of this site and implement the interaction rule for the two chosen individuals , now reads : pick two individuals from the patch and implement the reaction rule for the two chosen individuals .",
    "there are other , slightly different , ways of arriving at the above picture .",
    "for example , instead of dividing up the area of land into sites containing either one individual or no individuals , it could be divided up into a number of smaller patches , each of which contains several individuals . in this way of thinking",
    ", each small patch contains several @xmath28 and @xmath27 types , which interact with each other in the same way as for the large patch described above , and which move by exchange interactions with neighboring patches .",
    "while this defines a slightly different spatial model , the non - spatial version of the model is the same : all the individuals from the various patches are collected together into a single large patch . moreover ,",
    "even the spatial version of the model is in some sense a `` coarse - grained '' version of the original model  several sites in that model when viewed on a coarser scale can be reinterpreted as a site in the latter model .",
    "these features will be explored in more detail when we discuss the spatial aspects of these models in section [ spatial ] .",
    "for the remainder of this section we will consider only the non - spatial model .",
    "suppose to begin with we consider the simpler case of a single species , that is , a patch containing only @xmath24 and @xmath27 individuals",
    ". we shall postulate that the population dynamics of the system can be essentially described by three processes : birth , death , and competition .",
    "the first and third processes will involve two individuals : @xmath30 ( birth ) and @xmath31 ( competition ) , but the second process involves only one individual : @xmath32 ( death ) .",
    "these seem natural choices since , while death can be modeled as constant , independent of the density of individuals , the reduction in the numbers of @xmath24 due to competition and the growth in numbers of @xmath24 due to births will be density dependent .",
    "in other words , there will be a tendency for @xmath33 to go to @xmath34 because of overcrowding , and for @xmath34 to go to @xmath33 due to the presence of resources ( space ) to sustain a new individual .",
    "the time evolution of the model can now be described . at each time step",
    "we sample the patch . on a fraction @xmath22 of these occasions",
    "we randomly choose 2 individuals and allow them to interact and for @xmath23 of the draws we choose only one individual randomly .",
    "if in the former case we draw two @xmath27 `` individuals '' or in the latter case one @xmath27 `` individual '' , we simply put them back into the patch .",
    "for all other choices , an interaction may occur leading to the replacement of a different set of individuals to those drawn .",
    "for each of these processes we will introduce rate constants @xmath35 and @xmath17 as follows : @xmath36 we now only need to know the probabilities of drawing various combinations from the patch .",
    "simple combinatorics gives @xmath37 where the factor of 2 in the second term comes from the fact that the choices @xmath34 and @xmath38 are identical .",
    "these results enable us to write down expressions for the transition probability , per unit time step , of the system of individuals going from a state with @xmath39 @xmath24 individuals to a state with @xmath40 @xmath24 individuals .",
    "we denote this quantity by @xmath41 .",
    "since only transitions from @xmath39 to @xmath42 may take place during one time step , the only non - zero @xmath41 are @xmath43    the process defined by ( [ one_transprobs ] ) is a one - step markov process and so we can immediately write down a master equation describing how the probability of having @xmath39 individuals present in the patch , @xmath44 , changes with time @xcite .",
    "the rate of change of this quantity with time is simply the sum of transitions from the states with @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath24 individuals to the state with @xmath39 @xmath24 individuals , minus the sum of transitions from the state with @xmath24 individuals to the state with @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath24 individuals : @xmath47 this set of coupled equations has to be solved subject to an initial condition , typically @xmath48 , that is , a condition stating that there are known to be @xmath49 individuals in the patch at @xmath50 .",
    "care should also be taken with the boundary values @xmath51 and @xmath52 , since not all of the transitions are present in these cases . from ( [ one_transprobs ] )",
    "we see that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are formally zero .",
    "so as long as we define @xmath55 , thus we may use the general form ( [ one_master ] ) even for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the master equation ( [ one_master ] ) gives a complete description of the time evolution of the non - spatial model . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the model predictions in more detail .",
    "here we simply wish to make contact with the mean field ( i.e. the deterministic ) version of the model , obtained by taking the @xmath56 limit .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by multiplying the master equation ( [ one_master ] ) by @xmath39 and summing over all values of @xmath39 . by shifting the variable in two of the sums on @xmath39 by @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",
    "the following rate equation is obtained : @xmath59 where angle - brackets signify averages over the possible states of the system .",
    "defining @xmath60 and using ( [ one_transprobs ] ) , ( [ one_rate_eqn ] ) becomes @xmath61    so far no approximation has been made in the derivation of ( [ one_novern ] ) .",
    "however we now take the limit @xmath56 .",
    "in addition to eliminating the @xmath62 factor in the second term on the right hand - side of ( [ one_novern ] ) , it allows us to replace @xmath63 by @xmath64 .",
    "this gives @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the density of individuals in a given area .",
    "it is more conventional to write this in the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 eq .",
    "( [ one_mft2 ] ) is the mean field equation of the model and is the familiar logistic equation , usually written down as a phenomenological description of the population growth of a single species with intraspecific competition .",
    "here it is derived as the @xmath56 limit of our stochastic model and thus provides a reasonable description of our system when the potential size ( number of @xmath24 plus number of @xmath27 types ) of the system is relatively large .",
    "of course , this limit is purely formal . in practice",
    "what we mean that if @xmath26 is of the order @xmath69 , for instance , then this approximation is good if we are only interested in accuracies of up to @xmath70 ( if the next order corrections are of order @xmath62 ) or @xmath71 ( if the next order corrections are of order @xmath72 ) .",
    "this approximation obviously can not describe chance extinctions , which occur when @xmath39 is small , nor does it predict a mean time to extinction for the @xmath24 population . in regimes where these effects are important",
    ", it provides a poor description of the system , but this will inevitably be true of any purely deterministic description .    the necessity of introducing the `` empty site '' individuals @xmath27 should be clear from the above derivation . in order to be able to define a population density which changes with time we need a null population which can be displaced if the @xmath24 species is successful and increase if the @xmath24 population falters .",
    "it is also very natural to have a ceiling on the growth of @xmath24 individuals ( @xmath73 ) representing a limit on the available resources .",
    "if no @xmath27 s were introduced in the two species case , the two population sizes would not be independent and would simply add up to @xmath26",
    ". the @xmath24 population would obey ( [ one_mft2 ] ) and @xmath74 .",
    "this is clear if we simply imagine repeating the above derivation for a two species system by replacing @xmath27 by @xmath25 .",
    "although the interaction rules would be altered by this replacement , it would still be the case that @xmath75 .",
    "so it is vital to have `` empty space '' for individuals to exploit in order to obtain a realistic population dynamics .",
    "we have discussed the single species case in some detail since the construction of the master equation in the two species case ( and , in fact , in the @xmath76-species case for arbitrary @xmath76 ) follows similar lines . we still draw 2 individuals @xmath22 of the time and 1 individual @xmath23 of the time , but the processes and their rate constants are now : @xmath77 @xmath78    the rate constants @xmath79 , represent intra - specific competition and @xmath80 , inter - specific competition .",
    "analogous probabilities to ( [ one_choose ] ) of choosing particular combinations of @xmath28 and @xmath27 are @xmath81    transition probabilities now have initial and final states specified by two integers . the transition probability per unit time from the state @xmath82 to the state @xmath83",
    "will be denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "the non - zero transition probabilities are @xmath85    the master equation is an obvious generalization of ( [ one_master ] ) : @xmath86 this equation simply expresses the increase in @xmath87 due to the four possible transitions into the state @xmath82 described by @xmath88 , and the decrease due to transitions out of this state described by @xmath89 .",
    "the boundary and initial conditions are obvious analogs of those in the one - species case .",
    "the generalizations of ( [ one_rate_eqn ] ) are quite simple , since none of the transition probabilities involving changes only in @xmath90 enter into the equation for @xmath91 , and none of the transition probabilities involving changes only in @xmath39 enter into the equation for @xmath92 : @xmath93 we can now substitute the forms for ( [ two_transprobs ] ) into this equation and take the mean field limit @xmath56 .",
    "this allows us to factor @xmath94 into @xmath95 , as well as @xmath96 into @xmath64 and @xmath97 into @xmath98 as before .",
    "the final result for the rate of change of population densities are the competition equations @xmath99 familiar from population biology textbooks .",
    "the parameters in ( [ two_mft2 ] ) are related to the parameters of the stochastic model by @xmath100    as we will see in section [ spatial ] , essentially the same kind of reasoning as that given above can be applied in the spatial version of the model . before discussing this , however , we will investigate the large @xmath26 limit of ( [ one_master ] ) and ( [ two_master ] ) a little more carefully , obtaining corrections to mean field theory and comparing these to simulations .",
    "in the last section we gave arguments to show that the mean field versions of the stochastic models we had introduced were indeed the deterministic models conventionally used to describe these systems . in this section we will apply an elegant method due to van kampen @xcite which not only allows us to obtain these results in a more systematic way , but also gives a method of finding stochastic corrections to this deterministic result for large @xmath26 .",
    "we will only work to next - to - leading order in this paper .",
    "this will give a gaussian broadening to @xmath44 , or @xmath101 , with the peak of the distribution moving according to the relevant deterministic equation .",
    "we will then compare these results with numerical simulations of the full stochastic process .",
    "the large @xmath26 expansion is very clearly explained by van kampen in his book @xcite , so we will content ourselves with giving a brief outline of the method as applied to the one species case .",
    "the two species calculation follows very similar lines .",
    "we saw in the last section that , in the limit @xmath56 , the variable @xmath39 became deterministic and equal to @xmath102 . in this limit",
    "the function @xmath44 will be a delta - function .",
    "for large , but finite @xmath26 , we would expect @xmath44 to have a finite width of order @xmath103 .",
    "now @xmath39 is once again a stochastic variable , and it is natural to bring out the large @xmath26 structure of the theory by transforming to a new stochastic variable @xmath104 by writing @xmath105 we will not need to assume that the function @xmath66 satisfies any particular differential equation ; if we simply choose it to follow the peak of the distribution as it evolves in time , then the equation it satisfies will emerge .",
    "a new probability distribution function @xmath106 is defined by @xmath107 , which implies that @xmath108 when using this formalism it is useful to rewrite the master equation ( [ one_master ] ) using step operators which act on an arbitrary function of @xmath39 according to @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this gives @xmath111 + \\left ( { \\cal e}^{-1 } - 1 \\right ) \\left[t(n+1|n)p(n , t)\\right]\\ , . \\label{onestep_master}\\ ] ] this form of the master equation is useful because the step operators have a simple expansion involving powers of the operator @xmath112 , which simplifies the identification of differing orders in @xmath113 .",
    "we shall assume the initial condition on the equation to be @xmath48 .",
    "applying the method , and identifying powers of @xmath114 , yields the macroscopic equation @xmath115 to leading order and a fokker - planck equation @xmath116 + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_{2,0}(\\phi ) \\frac{\\partial^{2 } \\pi}{\\partial \\xi^{2 } } \\label{one_fp}\\ ] ] describing a linear stochastic process to next order . here",
    "the functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( we have used van kampen s notation ) are given by @xmath119    since the fokker - planck equation ( [ one_fp ] ) describes a linear process , its solution is a gaussian .",
    "this means that the probability distribution @xmath120 is completely specified by the first two moments @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "multiplying ( [ one_fp ] ) by @xmath104 and @xmath123 and integrating over all @xmath104 one finds @xmath124 the procedure is to solve ( [ one_macro ] ) and obtain @xmath125 as a function of @xmath126 .",
    "this function is then substituted into ( [ one_momenteqns ] ) and these equations solved for @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in the case of the first moment this may be performed quite generally to give @xmath127 choosing our initial condition to be @xmath128 the initial fluctuations vanish , and @xmath129 .",
    "thus @xmath130 for all @xmath126 .",
    "this summarizes the method .",
    "we therefore start by solving ( [ one_macro ] ) , subject to ( [ one_ic ] ) . defining @xmath131 for convenience ,",
    "the general solution for @xmath132 is @xmath133 where the constant @xmath24 is determined by the initial condition @xmath134 if @xmath135 then @xmath136 for all @xmath126 .",
    "if @xmath137 a degenerate form of the solution exists and is given by @xmath138    this solution can now be substituted into the equation for @xmath122 given in ( [ one_momenteqns ] ) . an integrating factor for this equation",
    "is @xmath139 , which yields upon use of the initial condition @xmath140 when @xmath132 , @xmath141^{4}}\\,\\left\\ { 2\\sigma^{2}\\hat{b}(\\hat{c } + \\hat{d})\\left [ 1 - e^{-2\\rho t } \\right ] \\right . \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\sigma a \\left [ 4\\hat{b}^{2 } + 10\\hat{b}(\\hat{c}+\\hat{d } ) +   \\hat{c}\\hat{d } \\right ] e^{-\\rho t } \\left [ 1 - e^{-\\rho t } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left .",

    "if the distribution has significant interaction with the boundaries at @xmath51 or @xmath52 , the gaussian approximation will break down .",
    "so , for example , if @xmath142 , the peak of the distribution will move from @xmath143 eventually coming to rest at @xmath144 . while this is happening the probability distribution broadens , eventually reaching its stationary value at @xmath145 on the other hand , if @xmath146 , the peak of the distribution will eventually tend to zero , and so the gaussian approximation will break down at some finite time .",
    "the case of two species follows in an exactly analogous manner : one writes @xmath147 and @xmath148 and defines a new probability distribution @xmath106 via @xmath149 .",
    "the macroscopic equations obeyed by @xmath66 and @xmath150 are again found to be identical to those given in section [ basic ] , and @xmath106 is again found to satisfy a fokker - planck equation describing a linear process , and is therefore a multivariate gaussian distribution .",
    "details are given in appendix a , where one sees that analytic expressions for the analogs of @xmath122 can not be obtained , in part at least , because the macroscopic equations can not be solved in closed form .",
    "however , we have solved them numerically , and we now go on to compare the large @xmath26 results in both the one species and two species cases with simulations of the original stochastic process .",
    "in order to better understand the range of validity of mean - field theory and its gaussian corrections , we have performed numerical simulations of the non - spatial model described above . the simulation of stochastic models of population dynamics has progressed in line with the availability of high - speed computers over the last two decades . during the beginning of this period , books on the stochastic dynamics of fluctuations in biological systems only mentioned simulations fleetingly @xcite , about a decade ago they had assumed a more central role @xcite , and are now regarded as essential in the understanding of these systems @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these last two references for more details on how these simulations are carried out in practice .    in our numerical algorithm",
    "an ensemble of patches is iterated forward in time . to achieve reasonable statistics",
    "we generally take the size of the ensemble to be several thousand realizations . in each small time step a single individual or a pair",
    "are selected from each patch in turn and with the appropriate probabilities transitions are made and the new individuals replaced .",
    "we periodically average over the ensemble to measure both the mean densities of individuals and the variance in the densities .",
    "concurrent with the stochastic simulation we also integrate forward the mean field equations and the equations for the gaussian variances ( eqs .",
    "( [ one_momenteqns ] ) and ( [ av_x])-([av_xy ] ) ) to allow a direct comparison .",
    "forward integration of the differential equations is performed using a second order runge kutta scheme .",
    "we will present some examples of our numerical work which illustrate the main effects that we have found .",
    "we have not performed an exhaustive numerical analysis due to the large parameter space of the competition models .",
    "the examples we give here are fairly typical of a wide range of parameter space , and are chosen to illustrate a variety of effects .",
    "our results may be summarized by the statement that so long as the size of the patch is large and the system is not close to extinction ( such that discrete effects play a strong role ) then the mean field equations , and the large @xmath26 correction yield a remarkably accurate description of the system dynamics .",
    "however , there is a fairly sharp transition signaling the failure of mean field theory as the patch size is reduced below a critical value . for smaller patches ,",
    "the quantitative precision of the mean field theory fails badly .",
    "this inaccuracy gives way to qualitative errors if one runs the system close to extinction . in this case the probability distribution of the populations is poorly approximated by a gaussian function and one is compelled to abandon mean field theory and its gaussian corrections .",
    "it is significant that the critical patch size depends sensitively on whether the patch contains one or two species , and whether there is interspecific competition . to clarify these statements",
    "we now lead the reader through some illustrative examples .",
    "an exhaustive list of parameter values is given in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "in figure 1 we give an example of a moderately large patch ( @xmath151 ) containing a single species .",
    "the mean density soon settles down to a ( quasi ) steady - state value as does the variance in the population density .",
    "mean field theory and the large @xmath26 corrections give very good agreement . in figure 2",
    "we show results for an identical situation but with the patch size reduced from 100 to 10 . in this case",
    "the quasi - steady - state is meaningless since extinction events are frequent and the mean density ( measured over the ensemble of patches ) steadily decays to zero @xcite .",
    "note , that the variance also decays to zero , since as time proceeds more and more realizations go extinct and the probability distribution of population densities is dominated by a delta function peak at zero .",
    "this illustrates the effect of discrete individuals for small systems .",
    "we now consider competition between two species in a single patch .",
    "we only consider large patches , where naively , discrete individual effects may be neglected . in figure 3",
    "we study the simplest case in which the @xmath24 and @xmath25 individuals have identical birth , death , and intraspecific competition rates .",
    "there is no explicit interspecific competition ( i.e. @xmath152 ) , although the finiteness of the patch leads to indirect competition between all individuals ( see eqs .",
    "( [ two_mft2 ] ) and ( [ two_identi ] ) ) .",
    "the patch is taken to be very large with a capacity of 400 individuals .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement between simulations and the mean field theory and its large-@xmath26 corrections .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that on reducing the patch size from 400 to 200 ( figure 4 ) the variance in the system increases steadily , far exceeding the large @xmath26 corrections .",
    "returning to the large 400 capacity patch and now introducing a small amount of interspecific competition ( figure 5 ) we again find that the large @xmath26 corrections fail to capture the growing fluctuations in the system .",
    "we conclude from this , and other simulations , that mean field theory and its gaussian corrections can work well , but only for patches above a critical size .",
    "this critical size is itself strongly dependent on the number of species , various growth parameters , and the presence or not of explicit interspecific competition .",
    "we have already discussed the spatial versions of the model in section [ basic ] . in one version of the model , the area under consideration is divided into a large number of patches , each containing a small number of individuals , which are then identified with the sites of a regular two - dimensional lattice ( usually a square lattice ) .",
    "competition takes place between individuals of a particular patch , and the birth rate is similarly only dependent on the population density of the parental patch , but individuals are allowed to migrate to nearest neighbor patches , if space is available ( that is , if an empty space , @xmath27 , exists at the neighboring site ) . in terms of this picture ,",
    "the lattice consists of an array of patches , which interact through migration of individuals from one patch to a nearest neighbor patch . in the other version of the model introduced in section [ basic ] , each patch contains only one individual , thus the sites of the lattice represent individuals rather than patches . in this case competition and birth processes , as well as migration ,",
    "depend on the occupancy of nearest - neighbor sites . in both versions of the model ,",
    "the death rate is constant .",
    "it is clear that many other variants are possible . in general",
    ", the first model will be more applicable to situations where individuals move on length scales which are much larger than the communities they live in , and the second model more applicable when all these processes occur on scales which are of the same order .",
    "however , we will see that in the exploration of the nature of the mean - field limit and the importance of stochastic effects , which is what interests us in this paper , these differences play a secondary role . in the next two sections we will follow the same program as was carried through for the non - spatial case : describing the stochastic process which defines the model , obtaining the mean - field limit , and finally comparing the mean field equations with simulations of the full model .",
    "much of the mathematical detail will be relegated to appendix b ; unfortunately while many of the ideas are simple generalizations of those introduced earlier , the mathematical notation becomes ( of necessity ) rather complex and detracts from the points which we wish to emphasize .",

    "we can write ( [ one_phi_eqn_spat ] ) in a more standard form by defining a diffusion constant @xmath172 and making the identification ( [ one_identi ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath173 where , as before , @xmath174 .",
    "the discussion of the second version of the spatial model follows similar lines .",
    "now there is only one individual per site , and therefore @xmath160 can only take on only two values : @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "in addition , birth and competition processes , as well as migration , depend on the occupancy of nearest neighbor sites .",

    "the only new feature is : @xmath185 just as before , we have assumed that the sites @xmath18 and @xmath156 were already chosen , so that the above probabilities only represent the choices of types of individuals at these chosen sites / patches and also the choice of the number of individuals in an event ( one or two ) . in the first model , we denoted the number of sites in the lattice by @xmath164 .",
    "this was independent of @xmath26 , the number of individuals in a patch .",
    "it was this latter quantity that we allowed to become infinitely large , in order to deduce the population - level description . in this second version , there is only one individual per site , and so it is the number of lattice sites ( now denoted by @xmath26 ) which we take to be infinitely large .",
    "more details of this approach are given in appendix b , where it is shown that , in the large @xmath26 limit , the population - level description is again given by ( [ one_phi_eqn_spat ] )  albeit with slightly different definitions of the parameters .",
    "this is not a surprise ; we would expect there to be a large number of ibms which differ in detail , but which have the correct qualitative features , and give the same population - level description .",
    "the partial differential equation ( [ one_eqn_spat ] ) is simply the ordinary differential equation for the non - spatial case ( [ one_phi_eqn ] ) , but with a term @xmath186 added .",
    "so the corresponding spatial description is indeed obtained by using the simplest prescription .",
    "however , this will not turn out to be the case when more than one species are present .",

    "comparison of theory to simulation for a patch containing two species , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "initially each species has a density of one quarter of the total patch capacity .",
    "the upper panel shows the time evolution of the densities of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath66 and @xmath150 , respectively ) , while the lower panel shows the time evolution of the variance of @xmath24 compared with the large-@xmath26 theory . in this case",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 individuals have identical birth , death , and competition parameters , and the interspecific competition is set to zero .",
    "the patch size has the large value of 400 .",
    "see table 2 for specific parameter values used in figures 3 - 5 .",
    "the same as figure 3 but with a patch size of 200 .",
    "note that although the mean field theory still works fairly well , the large-@xmath26 prediction for the variance is very poor .",
    "even for such a large patch , the fluctuations are increasing steadily with time .    a similar scenario to figure 3 , with the addition of weak interspecific interactions ( one fifth of the strength of the intraspecific interactions , with @xmath24 out - competing @xmath25 ) .",
    "here , the patch size is 400 , and the densities are fairly well approximated by mean field theory , although we see a slow decline in the @xmath25 population .",
    "however , the fluctuations are again increasing with time and are not well - described by the large-@xmath26 theory for large times .",
    "comparison of mean field theory ( smooth lines ) and simulation ( erratic lines ) for two species @xmath24 and @xmath25 in a spatial setting in which initially the @xmath24 individuals occupy the left half of the system and the @xmath25 individuals the right half .",
    "the upper ( lower ) panel shows early ( late ) times . here , the patch size has the relatively large value of 100 .",
    "@xmath24 out - competes @xmath25 ( meaning that @xmath304 ) but has a higher death rate , and so is invaded by @xmath25 . see table 3 for specific parameter values used in figures 6 - 9 .",
    "the same as figure 6 but here the patch size is reduced from 100 to the relatively small value of 10 . note that mean field theory is still in fairly good agreement with the high density @xmath25 population , but shows significant deviation for the stochastically weakened @xmath24 population .    a similar scenario to figure 6 , but now @xmath24 and @xmath25 have identical death rates and yet @xmath25 has less intraspecific competition than @xmath24 . in this example",
    "@xmath24 invades @xmath25 .",
    "the patch size here has the relatively large value of 50 .",
    "the simulations of spatial competition was performed in a directly analogous fashion to the non - spatial model described in section [ sim_nonspatial ] .",
    "we confined ourselves to one spatial dimension for simplicity .",
    "in addition , we only simulated the version of the model where a patch of size @xmath26 was placed at each site of the one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath215 . within each patch",
    "the usual dynamics of competition is played out .",
    "furthermore , in each small time step there is a small probability of dispersal of individuals from a given patch to the two neighboring patches , just as encoded in the master equation .",
    "we generally started with initial conditions in which species @xmath24 and @xmath25 were spatially separated and then proceed to intermix and compete as individuals diffuse from patch to patch .",
    "the mean field equations ( [ two_eqna_spat ] ) and ( [ two_eqnb_spat ] ) are again integrated forwards in time using second - order runge - kutta methods .",
    "an exhaustive list of parameter values is given in table 3 .    in a spatial system such as this , extinction is much less of a problem since should a patch become empty it will soon be restocked from neighboring patches . despite the weakened effect of discreteness in small patches , we still find that the behavior of the spatial systems differs significantly from mean field theory when patch sizes are below a critical value ( of approximate value 50 for the results presented here ) .",
    "as before , we have chosen to present two typical scenarios .    in figure 6",
    "we show the early and late time behavior for a system in which initially the @xmath24 individuals occupy the left half of the system , and the @xmath25 individuals occupy the right half . in the ensuing dynamics ,",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 individuals have identical mobilities , growth rates , and intraspecific competition parameters . however , the @xmath24 individuals are disadvantaged by having a slightly higher death rate than the @xmath25 s .",
    "this is balanced by giving the @xmath24 s an interspecific competitive advantage over the @xmath25 s . on varying the strengths of these balancing forces it is possible to obtain invasion of @xmath24 s from left to right or invasion of @xmath25 s from right to left .",
    "we have chosen an example of the latter .",
    "it is seen that mean field theory does an excellent job in predicting the long time dynamics of the system . in this figure",
    "the patch size is rather large with a capacity of 100 .    in figure 7",
    "we repeat the exact simulation as before but simply reduce the patch size from 100 to 10 . in this case the a individuals are severely affected by discrete extinction events and their density is in poor agreement with mean field theory .",
    "interestingly , the denser @xmath25 individuals are fairly well described by mean field theory throughout the range .",
    "we also studied an alternative balance of effects as follows . in figure 8",
    "we show a situation in which the death rates for the two species are the same , but now we reduce the amount of intraspecific competition among the @xmath25 individuals .",
    "again , the @xmath24 s have an interspecific competitive advantage over the @xmath25 s . in this case",
    "the @xmath24 s invade the @xmath25 s . here",
    "the patch size has the intermediate value of 50 individuals .",
    "we see that mean field theory performs relatively well .",
    "on reducing the patch size for this particular scenario , from 50 to 10 ( figure 9 ) we see the failure of mean field theory ( which predicts invasion from left to right ) .",
    "the enhanced fluctuations in the smaller patches lead to a quasi - dynamical balance in the interfacial region between @xmath24 s and @xmath25 s . in this region",
    "the @xmath24 s are beset by fluctuation - induced extinction events and this makes them too weak to invade the @xmath25 s in the usual manner of a fisher wave . instead ,",
    "over longer scales than shown in the figure , the density of @xmath24 s slowly permeates the @xmath25-rich region in a `` creeping '' motion .",
    "there are many ways to formulate population dynamics .",
    "popular descriptions tend to be either deterministic ( mean field ) equations , or individual based algorithms designed for implementation on a computer .",
    "the extreme difference in these two approaches has led to difficulties in directly comparing results .",
    "disparities may be due to fundamental deficiencies in one or both of the techniques , or else be attributable to `` renormalization '' of various parameters . in this paper",
    "we have attempted to bridge the gap between mean field models and individual - based models . we have described a very general framework with which to formulate population dynamics using the language of `` patches '' to create a concrete picture of the stochastic process .",
    "the size of the patch is the central parameter .",
    "mean field theory is recovered on taking the patch size to infinity , while discrete stochastic effects become prominent for small patches containing a few individuals .",
    "again , we emphasize that in our usage `` mean field '' refers to the approximation in which cross - correlations between stochastic variables is neglected , but still allows for an explicitly spatial description .    from a biological perspective",
    ", a patch can be thought of as a ( small ) spatial region within which interactions between individuals occur .",
    "it is assumed that movement within this scale is not biologically significant . in our spatial patch model ,",
    "movement of an individual between patches is biologically significant since that individual will now have interactions with a new set of individuals in a neighboring region . for systems in which interactions ( not involving movement per se )",
    "occur over larger scales , it will be necessary to include additional inter - patch processes .",
    "we have studied both non - spatial and spatial models .",
    "the non - spatial case corresponds to a single patch containing a number of individuals of both species .",
    "we have derived the corresponding mean field theory and its first order corrections ( i.e. gaussian fluctuations about the deterministic predictions ) .",
    "generally , so long as the patch size is above a critical value ( which tends to be of the order of 100 in the examples shown here ) , and the birth and death rates are such that a sizable quasi - steady - state population is possible , then the mean - field theory and its corrections give a satisfactory description of the system . for smaller patches , or for situations",
    "in which there is a non - negligible probability of extinction , it is crucial to account for the discrete nature of the individuals .",
    "the population dynamics is inherently stochastic and one must dispense with a deterministic description . by tuning the patch size we have seen that the transition from a mean - field like to a stochastic regime is rather sharp and dependent on the existence of inter - specific interactions ( in this case , competition ) .",
    "the same general picture holds for the spatially explicit models .",
    "we have discussed two types of spatial patch models . in one , at each spatial site there is a `` micro - patch '' which may hold at most one individual .",
    "movement and competition occurs between patches . in the other ,",
    "each lattice site is a patch of tunable size and competition occurs inside the patch .",
    "movement , of course , is still between patches .",
    "a careful formulation shows that each model has the same spatial mean - field limit .",
    "of particular interest is the emergence of novel non - linear diffusion terms , which are only present when two or more species are competing for space .",
    "these terms are not written down in the standard `` intuitively derived '' continuum equations of spatial competition models .",
    "they are especially important in spatial regions in which the density of one species is high , while the density of the other is strongly spatially varying .",
    "this would occur , for instance , in a region of space containing a population boundary for one species ( due to some environmental barrier ) but not for the other .",
    "we intend to investigate such effects in more detail in a follow - up paper .    in our investigation of spatial mean field models ,",
    "we have found them to be more robust than in the non - spatial case .",
    "this is primarily due to the weakening of local extinction via continual rescue effects from neighboring patches .",
    "it is still the case however that as the patch size is decreased , the quantitative precision of mean - field models suffers , and with smaller patches still ( we have in mind patches of size 10 or less ) new stochastically driven qualitative features emerge .",
    "an example of this was given ( figure 9 ) in which an invasion process ( in mean field theory ) was halted due to stochastic weakening of the leading edge of the invading population density .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a simple framework with which to discuss fluctuation effects in population biology .",
    "this framework is based on the use of patch models as concrete realizations of stochastic processes .",
    "the transition from mean field behavior to fluctuation dominated stochastic dynamics is effected by reducing the size of the patch .",
    "the critical patch size separating these two regimes depends sensitively on the biological interactions present .",
    "this has been an intensively theoretical work . in future work",
    "we intend to apply the patch model to a variety of multi - species population dynamics to address the importance of fluctuations and validity of mean field theories in a quantitative and controlled manner .",
