    "despite continuous efforts , several properties of many body systems in the presence of quenched disorder and frustration are still not well understood .",

    "exceptions in this respect are such systems in which disorder fluctuations are fully dominant and the properties of the system are governed by an infinite - disorder fixed point.@xcite this happens , among others for random quantum spin chains and for a class of stochastic models with quenched disorder . if , however , the properties of the system are controlled by a conventional ( finite - disorder ) random fixed point , such as for classical spin glasses , the exact results are scarce .    in these cases , in order to obtain more accurate information ,",
    "one often considers hierarchical lattices  @xcite in which the migdal - kadanoff renormalization  @xcite can be performed exactly . for simple models , such as for",
    "directed polymers , one can notice a simple , although nonlinear relation between the original and the transformed random energies and one can derive closed integral equations between the corresponding distribution functions , which can then be studied by various methods.@xcite however for spin models , such as the random - bond ising model , it is generally not possible to write renormalization equations directly for the distribution functions .",
    "in these cases one can treat numerically large finite samples exactly and average the obtained results over quenched disorder.@xcite although bringing very accurate numerical results , this type of treatment is still not exact and , as usually happens in random systems , the source of inaccuracy comes from the averaging process over quenched disorder . in such calculations one can not , for example , decide about the universality of the fixed points , i.e. , if the critical singularities are independent or not of the form of the initial distribution of the disorder .    in this paper",
    "we consider such a spin model , the @xmath0-state random potts model  @xcite in the large-@xmath0 limit , for which the migdal - kadanoff renormalization leads to closed integral equations in terms of the distribution functions . in this respect",

    "we note that in the disordered case the large-@xmath0 limit is generally not singular,@xcite the critical behavior is qualitatively similar to that of finite @xmath0 and also the critical exponents are smoothly saturating as @xmath7.@xcite we mention that it has been recently suggested that , in the large-@xmath0 limit , the potts model is a plausible model for supercooled liquids .",
    "this is indeed the case within the mean - field approach  @xcite but it seems to be completely different for the nearest - neighbor model.@xcite    to consider the large-@xmath0 limit of the model leads to technical simplifications , at least for random ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "the high - temperature series expansion of the model is dominated by a single diagram , the properties of which have been studied in @xmath8 and @xmath9 by combinatorial optimization methods.@xcite this type of simplification is valid for the hierarchical lattice , too , but for this lattice the exact renormalization holds for antiferromagnetic couplings , too . as we will see the renormalized parameters in this limit are expressed as simple but nonlinear combinations of the original parameters , such as the interface free energy .",

    "<S> we consider the critical behavior of the random @xmath0-state potts model in the large-@xmath0 limit with different types of disorder leading to either the nonfrustrated random ferromagnet regime or the frustrated spin - glass regime . </S>",
    "<S> the model is studied on the diamond hierarchical lattice for which the migdal - kadanoff real - space renormalization is exact . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown to have a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase and the phase transition is controlled by four different fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the system is characterized by the distribution of the interface free energy @xmath1 which is shown to satisfy different integral equations at the fixed points . by numerical integration </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained the corresponding stable laws of nonlinear combination of random numbers and obtained numerically exact values for the critical exponents . </S>"
