    "critical behavior of the fracture - failure phenomena in disordered materials has attracted wide interest these days @xcite . among several model studies , the fiber bundle models ( fbm )",
    "capture almost correctly the collective static and dynamics of fracture - failure in loaded materials .",
    "the two different versions of fbm have been studied much .",
    "the equal load sharing ( els ) model @xcite considers democratic ( equal ) sharing of applied load on the bundle , whereas in local load sharing ( lls ) model @xcite , only the nearest neighbors support the terminal load ( stress ) of a failed fiber .",
    "experimentally it has been observed @xcite that disordered material under increasing load shows well defined power laws in terms of acoustic emissions prior to the global rupture .",
    "such a power law in burst avalanches has been achieved analytically ( and verified through simulations ) by hemmer and hansen @xcite in els model .",
    "it is also known since several decades that the static els model has a critical point @xcite , i.e. , at a critical strength ( @xmath0 ) the bundle shows a phase transition from a state of partial failure ( for @xmath1 ) to the state of total failure ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "this failure dynamics has been solved analytically @xcite which explores the critical behavior through the power law variation of order parameter , susceptibility and relaxation time .",
    "also the mean - filed universality of els model has been established recently @xcite .",
    "the extensive studies on lls model @xcite suggest that the strength goes to ` zero ' value as the bundle size approaches infinity @xcite , thus excludes the possibility of any critical behavior .",
    "another important observation is that no universal power law asymptotics exists for the avalanche statistics @xcite in lls model .",
    "attempts have also been made to study both , the els and lls models in a single framework introducing adjustable load sharing parameter @xcite and a crossover from mean - field ( els ) to short - range ( lls ) behavior has been reported .",
    "so far in the fbm studies , people mainly considered different fiber threshold distributions starting from zero threshold . however , in reality every element ( fiber ) should have a finite ( non - zero ) strength threshold due to the cohesive force among the constituting molecules .",
    "therefore the idea of a lower cutoff in fiber threshold distribution would be most welcome .",
    "andersen et al @xcite considered first a lower cutoff in fiber threshold distribution and established the ` tricritical behavior ' in the mean - field ( els ) fiber bundle model .",
    "such distributions with lower cutoff have also been considered to study the nonlinear response in els mode @xcite and to establish the universal behavior @xcite of els failure dynamics .",
    "the exclusion of weaker fibers not only enhances the ultimate strength of the bundle , it can affect the failure properties of the bundle . to investigate such possibilities in the present work we consider els and lls models and proceed through analytic as well as numerical methods .",
    "we organize this report as follows : after a brief introduction ( section i ) we study the effect of lower cutoff in els model ( section ii ) and in lls model ( section iii ) .",
    "the importance of such study and the physical significance of the observed results are discussed in the conclusion ( section iv ) . in the appendix",
    "we apply our analytic formulations in two different situations of fiber threshold distribution .",
    "we consider a fiber bundle model having @xmath3 parallel fibers subjected to an external load or stress ( load per fiber ) .",
    "the threshold strength of each fiber is determined by the stress value ( @xmath4 ) it can bear , and beyond which it fails .",
    "we consider fiber threshold distribution to have a lower cutoff ( @xmath5 ) , i.e. , a randomly distributed normalized density @xmath6 has been chosen within the interval @xmath5 and @xmath7 such that @xmath8    we follow step - wise equal load increment @xcite till the total failure of the bundle .",
    "the breaking dynamics starts when an initial stress @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is applied on the bundle .",
    "fibers having strength less than @xmath9 fail instantly reducing the number of intact fibers and these fibers have to bear the applied load ( els rule ) .",
    "hence the effective stress ( on intact fibers ) increases and this compels some more fibers to break .",
    "these two sequential operations , the stress redistribution and further breaking of fibers continue till an equilibrium is reached , where either the surviving fibers are strong enough to bear the applied load or all fibers fail .",
    "the breaking dynamics can be represented by a recursion relation @xcite in discrete time steps :    @xmath11 where , @xmath12 is the fraction of total fibers that survive after time step @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the cumulative distribution of corresponding density @xmath6 , @xmath15 the time step indicates the number of stress redistribution at a fixed applied load .    at the equilibrium or steady state we get @xmath16 .",
    "this is a fixed point of the recursive dynamics and eqn .",
    "( [ els-1 ] ) can be solved at the fixed point for some particular strength distribution .",
    ".1 in    * fig . 1 : * the uniform density of fiber strength having a lower cutoff ( @xmath5 ) .",
    ".1 in    we choose the uniform density of fiber strength threshold having a lower cutoff ( fig .",
    "1 ) to solve the recursive failure dynamics of els model . thus @xmath6 has the form : @xmath17 the cumulative distribution becomes @xmath18 therefore @xmath12 follows a simple recursion relation : @xmath19,\\label{els-4}\\ ] ]    which has fixed points @xcite : @xmath20;\\label{els-5}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath21    beyond this critical strength ( @xmath0 ) the whole bundle fails instantly .",
    "the solution with ( @xmath22 ) sign is the stable one , whereas the one with ( @xmath23 sign gives unstable solution @xcite .",
    ".1 in    .1 in    * fig . 2 : * the graphical solutions of eqn .",
    "( [ els-4 ] ) : straight lines represent the fixed points . in ( a ) @xmath24 , @xmath25 , solid curve ( @xmath26 ) , dashed line ( @xmath27 ) , dotted line ( @xmath2 ) . in ( b ) @xmath28 , solid curve ( @xmath29 ) , dashed line ( @xmath30 ) .",
    ".1 in    it is obvious that the critical strength ( @xmath0 ) can not be less than @xmath5 . _",
    "as @xmath0 is a critical point ( see @xcite ) , there should be some critical exponents associated to @xmath0 .",
    "if none of the fibers fail ( @xmath31 ) , we can not define order parameter , susceptibility , relaxation time etc . which show critical behavior of the failure dynamics .",
    "therefore , at @xmath0 the bundle should be in a partially broken ( stable ) state .",
    "_ putting the condition @xmath32 in eqn .",
    "( [ sigmac ] ) , we get the upper bound of lower cutoff : @xmath33",
    ". we can verify that for @xmath34 the recursion ( eqn .",
    "[ els-4 ] ) does not give a stable fixed point except @xmath35 .",
    "also , putting @xmath34 in fixed point solution ( eqn .",
    "[ els-5 ] ) , we get @xmath36 , which is unrealistic",
    ". therefore the critical strength of els model is bounded by an upper limit : @xmath37 .",
    "we present graphical solutions ( fig .",
    "2 ) of the recursion relation ( eqn . [ els-4 ] ) for @xmath33 ( a ) and @xmath34 ( b ) . clearly , we can not get a fixed point ( @xmath38 ) in ( b ) .    from the solution ( eqn .",
    "[ els-5 ] ) we can obtain the order parameter ( @xmath39 ) , susceptibility ( @xmath40 ) and relaxation time ( @xmath41 ) @xcite of the failure process : @xmath42 @xmath43    @xmath44    therefore the variation of order parameter , susceptibility and relaxation time remain unaffected by the presence of lower cutoff .",
    "now , we follow the weakest fiber breaking approach @xcite : the applied load is tuned in such a way that only the weakest fiber ( among the intact fibers ) will fail after each step of loading .",
    "we first find out the extreme condition when the whole bundle fails instantly after the first fiber ruptures .",
    "as the strength thresholds of @xmath3 fibers are uniformly distributed within @xmath5 and @xmath7 , the weakest fiber fails at a stress @xmath5 ( for large @xmath3 ) .",
    "after this single fiber failure , the load will be redistributed within intact fibers resulting a global stress @xmath45 .",
    "now , the number of intact fibers having strength threshold below @xmath46 is    @xmath47    the stress redistribution can break at least another fiber if @xmath48 and this ` second ' failure will trigger another failure and so on .",
    "thus the successive breaking of fibers can not be stopped till the complete collapse of the bundle .",
    "clearly , there can not be any fixed point ( critical point ) for such ` instant failure ' situation .",
    "putting the value of @xmath46 we get    @xmath49    which gives @xmath50 for large @xmath3 limit , the above condition can be written as @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the condition to get a fixed point in the failure process is @xmath33 .",
    ".1 in    .1 in    * fig . 3 :",
    "* the total step of load increase ( till final failure ) is plotted against @xmath5 for a els model having @xmath52 fibers .",
    "the dotted line represents the analytic form ( eqn .",
    "[ step no ] ) , triangles are the simulated data for a strictly uniform strength distribution and the circles represent the data ( averages are taken for @xmath53 samples ) for a uniform on average distribution .",
    ".1 in    we can also calculate how many steps are required to attain the final catastrophic failure for @xmath33 .",
    "let us assume that we have to increase the external load @xmath54 times before the final failure .",
    "at each step of such load increment only one fiber fails . then after @xmath54 step the following condition should be fulfilled to have a catastrophic failure :    @xmath55}\\rho(\\sigma_{th})d\\sigma_{th}\\geq1.\\label{uni - step-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56    the solution gives @xmath57",
    "the above equation suggests that at @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "but in reality we have to put the external load once to break the weakest fiber of the bundle .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 for @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . to check the validity of the above calculation we take ` strictly unifrom ' and uniform on average distributions of fiber strength . in our ` strictly unifrom ' distribution the strength of the @xmath61-th fiber ( among @xmath3 fibers ) is @xmath62 .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "3 that the ` strictly uniform distribution ' exactly obeys the analytic formula ( [ step no ] ) but the uniform on average distribution shows slight disagreement which comes from the fluctuation in the distribution function for finite system size .",
    "this fluctuation will disappear at the limit @xmath63 where we expect perfect agreement .      during the failure process",
    "` avalanches ' of different size appear where simultanious failure of numbers of fiber is termed as ` avalanche ' . to investigate whether the avalanche size distributions depend on the lower cutoff or not , we go for a numerical study .",
    "the result ( fig .",
    "4 ) demands that for small avalanche sizes the distributions show a gradual deviation ( depend on @xmath5 ) from the mean - field result , although the big avalanches still follow the mean - field power law ( exponent value @xmath64 ) as analytically derived by hemmer and hansen @xcite .",
    "we have checked this result for several system sizes and the above feature remains invariant . we should mention that according to eqns .",
    "( 37 - 39 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the analytic treatment is valid for @xmath33 as @xmath65 is the maximum ( upper limit of the integration in eqn .",
    "( 37 ) ) of the stress - strain curve .",
    "presence of @xmath5 cuts out the lower part of the stress - strain curve where the small avalanches are most likely to happen .",
    "therefore , smaller avalanches get reduced in number with the increase of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . at the limit @xmath66",
    ", the avalanche distributions seem to follow a new power law with exponent @xmath67 , which can be explained as : the fluctuation in threshold distribution gives rise a scenario like the unbiased random walk of the bundle s strength around the maximum @xmath65 , which in turn results exponent @xmath67 in avalanche distribution @xcite .",
    ".1 in    .1 in    * fig .",
    "4 : * the avalanche size distributions for different values of @xmath5 : @xmath68 and averages are done over @xmath69 sample .",
    "we have drawn two power laws ( dotted lines ) as reference lines to compare our numerical results .",
    "now we consider lls model with uniform fiber threshold distribution having a lower cutoff @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we shall present a probabilistic argument to determine the upper limit of @xmath5 , beyond which the whole bundle fails at once . following the weakest fiber breaking approach the first fiber fails at an applied stress @xmath5 ( for large @xmath3 ) . as we are using periodic boundary conditions , the @xmath70 nearest neighbors ( @xmath70 is the coordination number ) bear the terminal stress of the failing fiber and their stress value rises to @xmath71 .",
    "now , number of nearest neighbors ( intact ) having strength threshold below @xmath46 is @xmath72 ( see eqn .",
    "( [ ad-1 ] ) ) . putting the value of @xmath73 and @xmath46",
    "we finally get @xmath74 if @xmath75 , then at least another fiber fails and this is likely to trigger a cascade of failure events resulting complete collapse of the bundle . therefore , to avoid the ` instant failure ' situation we must have @xmath76 , from which we get the upper bound of @xmath5 :    @xmath77    as the above condition does not depend on the coordination number @xmath70 , at any dimension",
    "the whole bundle is likely to collapse at once for @xmath51 .",
    "it should be mentioned that lls model should behave almost like els model at the limit of infinite dimensions and therefore the identical bound ( of @xmath5 ) in both the cases is not surprising ( see appendix ) .",
    "we numerically confirm ( fig .",
    "5 ) the above analytic argument ( eqn .",
    "[ lls - prob2 ] ) in one dimension .",
    "when average step value goes below 1.5 line , one step failure is the dominating mode then .",
    "we can find out the extreme limit of @xmath5 when all the nearest neighbors fail after the weakest fiber breakes .",
    "then the lls bundle collapses instantly for sure . setting @xmath78 we get the condition @xmath79 , where stress level of all the nearest neighbors crosses the upper cutoff 1 of the strength distribution .",
    "clearly such failure is very rapid ( like a chain reaction ) and does not depend on the shape of the strength distributions , except for the upper cutoff .",
    "also as @xmath70 increases ( els limit ) - @xmath5 for instant failure assumes the trivial value 1 .",
    "similar sudden failure in fbm has been discussed by moreno et al @xcite in the context of a ` one sided load transfer ' model which is different from the true lls model we consider here .",
    ".1 in    .1 in    * fig . 5 : * numerical estimate of the upper bound of @xmath5 in lls model : for @xmath80 the average step values go below @xmath81 , i.e. , the bundle fails at one step in most of the realisations .      the local load sharing ( lls ) scheme introduces stress enhancement around the failed fiber , which accelerate damage evolution .",
    "therefore , a few isolated cracks can drive the system toward complete failure through growth and coalescence .",
    "the lls model shows zero strength ( for fiber threshold distributions starting from zero value ) at the limit @xmath63 , following a logarithmic dependence on the system size ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "recently mahesh et al @xcite have proposed a probabilistic method of finding the asymptotic strength of bundles in lls mode .",
    "now for threshold distributions having a lower cutoff ( @xmath5 ) , the ultimate strength of the bundle can not be less than @xmath5 .",
    "for such a uniform distribution ( fig .",
    "1 ) , we perform numerical simulations to investigate the system size variation of bundle s strength .",
    "we observe ( fig .",
    "6 ) that as @xmath5 increases the quantity ( strength-@xmath5 ) approaches zero following straight lines with @xmath82 , but the slope gradually decreases which suggests that the system size dependence of the strength gradually becomes weaker .",
    ".1 in    .1 in    * fig . 6 : * the ( strength ",
    "@xmath5 ) is plotted against @xmath82 for different @xmath5 values : @xmath83 ( square ) , @xmath84 ( circle ) , @xmath85 ( up triangle ) , @xmath86 ( down triangle ) , @xmath87 ( star ) .",
    "all the straight lines approach @xmath88 value as @xmath63 .      .05 in    * fig . 7 : * avalanche size distribution for several @xmath5 in lls model : @xmath89 , averages are taken over @xmath69 samples",
    ". number of different avalanches decreases with the increase of @xmath5value .    .05 in    due to faster crack - growth , lls model shows different avalanche statistics than that of in els model .",
    "the numerical study of hansen and hemmer @xcite suggests an apparent power law having exponent @xmath90 in the avalanche distribution .",
    "later , kloster et al @xcite have shown analytically that for flat ( uniform ) distribution lls model does not have any power law asymptotics in avalanche statistics .",
    "we numerically study the avalanche distribution in lls model for different @xmath5 values ( fig .",
    "we observe a similar deviation ( lowering ) of the distribution function for the smaller avalanche sizes as in case of els model .",
    "also , the number of different avalanches gets reduced ( tail of the distribution disappears ) with the increase of @xmath5 .",
    "this occurs due to damage localization @xcite which ensures faster collapse of the bundle . in fig .",
    "7 we can see that for @xmath91 , avalanches of size @xmath7 is the only possibility before total failure and their count is always less than @xmath7 , which clearly indicates the dominance of ` instant failure ' situation .",
    "a lower cutoff in fiber threshold distribution excludes the presence of very weak fibers in a bundle .",
    "the weaker fibers mainly reduces the strength of a bundle . but",
    "in practical purpose we always try to build stronger and stronger materials ( ropes , cables etc . ) from the fibrous elements .",
    "therefore this situation ( exclusion of weaker fibers ) is very realistic .",
    "the failure dynamics of els model almost remains unchanged in the presence of such lower cutoff ( @xmath5 ) , whereas the avalanche size distributions show a systematic deviation ( for small avalanches ) from the mean field nature . at the limiting point ( @xmath66 )",
    ", we get a new power law ( exponent @xmath67 ) in avalanche distribution which can be explained from random walk statistics @xcite . in lls",
    "model the avalanche statistics show drastic change with the increase of @xmath5 . in both the models ,",
    "the lower cutoff becomes bounded by an upper limit ( @xmath33 ) beyond which the whole bundle fails at once , which has important consequence : it seems that the bundles show elastic - like response @xcite up to @xmath58 , above which they become perfectly brittle .",
    "we observe that the ` weakest fiber breaking approach ' @xcite and the ` equal load increment approach ' @xcite give similar result ( in els mode ) . in the equal load increment method ,",
    "sometimes more than one fibers fail at the time of loading and this affects the whole failure dynamics , whereas the weakest fiber breaking approach ensures the single fiber ( weakest among the intact fibers ) failure at each step of loading .",
    "we consider the equal load increment method to be more practical from the experimental point of view .",
    "this approach helps to construct the recursion relations @xcite which in turn show critical behavior @xcite of the failure process .",
    "the ` instant failure ' situation is not limited to uniform threshold distribution , rather it is common in any type of distributions ( see appendix ) .",
    "it seems that the ` instant failure ' represents the binary states of the bundle : ` intact ' ( 1 or high ) and ` completely broken ' ( 0 or low ) and here the bundle behaves like a classical ` switch ' in response to external load .",

    "p. c. hemmer and dr .",
    "m. kloster for useful comments and suggestions .",
    "s. p. thanks the norwegian research council , nfr for the funding through a strategic university program .",
    "therefore , the bound ( beyond which one - instant failure will occur ) of the lower cutoff comes to be @xmath95 for large @xmath3 limit .",
    ".4 in * b. lls model * .1 in the condition for ` instant failure ' for lls model is : @xmath96}\\rho(\\sigma_{th})d\\sigma_{th}\\geq1.\\label{inc-1-lls}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the coordination number or the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "this gives      now , as dimension of the system increases @xmath70 goes towards infinity .",
    "hence the above condition gives the bound of the lower cutoff as @xmath95 , which is identical to that of in the equivalent els case .",
    "following eqn .",
    "( [ inc-1-lls ] ) , the condition for ` instant failure ' is : @xmath101 which reduces to @xmath102 for @xmath103 and sets the bound of the lower cutoff to @xmath100 .",
