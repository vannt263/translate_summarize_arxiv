    "due to the demands of modern electronics , semiconductor devices are becoming smaller and faster , which means that applied external fields cause strongly inhomogeneous and nonequilibrium processes in such systems . a powerful approach to study dynamical properties of potentially useful devices",
    "is to apply short ( femto- or picosecond ) electric field pulses and to measure the response of the system .",
    "recent progress in ultrafast laser pulse experimental techniques allows one to study the physical processes in such systems with a very high precision ( for a review , see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "for example , with this technique one can measure nonequilibrium energy and momentum distributions , or the dynamics of excited states .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to develop theoretical tools to describe these experiments , as well as to understand ultrafast processes in small semiconductor devices in general .    the theoretical description of ultrafast phenomena triggered by short - pulse laser fields is a complicated problem due to several reasons .",
    "one of the most difficult tasks is to take into account many - particle correlation effects properly .",
    "an external pulse field causes the following main effects in the system : i ) direct electron photoemission ; ii ) inverse electron photoemission , and iii ) absorption processes .",
    "the first two phenomena can be described in terms of free quasi - particles , which makes the problem relatively simple .",
    "a proper description of optical absorption spectra is a much more complicated task due to quasi - particle correlation effects .",
    "in particular , external laser pulses can create excitons , or coupled electron - hole pairs .",
    "the problem of correctly describing optical absorption spectra with excitonic features in the case of applied short - time laser pulses is one of the great challenges in condensed matter physics .    for small devices in the presence of a short - pulse field typical time scales",
    "are shorter than the coulomb scattering time ( see , for example , ref .  ) , which means that one can not treat the coulomb interaction effects by using a simple boltzmann equation approach , where all the coulomb effects are `` hidden '' in a scattering time parameter @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the semiconductor bloch equation ( sbe ) approach , @xcite based on the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , and other mean - field methods have difficulties under these circumstances , because of the presence of strong fluctuations . in principle , coulomb interaction effects can be taken into account in a systematic way by using non - equilibrium green function techniques , @xcite similar to the equilibrium case .",
    "unfortunately , this technique becomes numerically very complicated in a strongly nonequilibrium situation , since in this case the green functions depend on two or more time arguments , which puts high requirements on the computer memory size and makes the numerical analysis very time - consuming.@xcite    in this paper , we discuss an alternative and potentially very powerful approach to study these kinds of problems , based on density - functional theory ( dft),@xcite and in particular its time - dependent generalization ( tddft).@xcite in this approach , numerical calculations should be much less time - consuming compared to the green s function method .",
    "tddft has been successfully applied to describe molecular excitations;@xcite however , this approach has some difficulties in describing extended systems.@xcite it is known that the standard local - density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the dft exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential can not be applied to describe some effects beyond the ground state properties in extended systems , like the energy band gaps and excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra .",
    "therefore , in order to apply tddft to study ultrafast processes , and in particular to describe correctly the optical absorption spectra in such systems , it is necessary to find suitable xc potentials .    for weak and smooth external fields , such a potential can constructed by using the many - body bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) approach @xcite . in fact , in this case tddft calculations with an xc potential extracted from the bse give very good results for the optical absorption spectra in a set of bulk semiconductors .",
    "unfortunately , the bse - tddft approach can not be used directly to construct an xc potential for excitation with strong short pulses , since here the linear response theory can not be applied , and the equations in time domain depend on many time variables , which makes numerical solution extremely difficult to obtain ( similar to non - equilibrium green s functions ) .",
    "therefore , it would be extremely useful to find a simple xc potential which will allow one to use tddft straightforwardly to study the optical response of a system in the time domain .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "that for smooth and weak fields such a potential exists .",
    "namely , the exact - exchange approximation for the time - dependent optimized effective potential ( xx - tdoep ) results in optical absorption spectra with pronounced excitonic features , by solving the problem in the frequency domain .",
    "kim and grling  @xcite showed that the main reason for this was the presence of @xmath2 coulomb singularity in the exchange energy kernel .",
    "the xx - tdoep has recently been extended into the nonlinear , real - time domain for simple quasi - one - dimensional quantum well systems.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is twofold : 1 ) we will formulate a general tddft approach to study optical interband excitations in terms of the kohn - sham density matrix .",
    "the corresponding system of equations has the formal simplicity of the sbes , which allows one to solve it directly in the time domain , contrary to the many - body green function approach , where it is difficult to treat the problem numerically . at the same time",
    ", this approach has a great formal advantage in comparison with the sbe formalism , since in tddft the coulomb interaction effects are treated in principle exactly .",
    "2 ) we will show that by using simple exchange - only functionals , the essence of excitonic features can be captured in a relatively simple manner . as an example",
    ", we consider the model of a three - dimensional two - band bulk insulator for different local xc potentials and show that its optical absorption spectra contain qualitatively correct excitonic features , whenever the xc energy kernel has a @xmath0 singularity .    the paper is organized as follows : we introduce a general tddft - sbe formalism in terms of the kohn - sham density matrix in section  [ formalism ] . in section  [ 3d ] ,",
    "we derive the tddft - sbe formalism and in section  [ results ] we apply this formalism to study the optical absorption spectra for a three - dimensional two - band model insulator with different xc potentials and compare the results with hf .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "some technical details are given in appendix .",
    "we use hartree atomic units ( @xmath3 ) throughout the paper .",
    "the general dft hamiltonian for a many - electron system in a solid ( in the born - oppenheimer approximation ) can be written in the following form : @xmath4({\\bf r } ) + v_{xc}[n]({\\bf r } ) , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the nuclear potential for the electrons and @xmath6({\\bf r})=\\int d{\\bf r}'\\frac{n({\\bf r}')}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| } \\label{vh}\\ ] ] is the hartree potential , where @xmath7 is the density of electrons .",

    "the electric field is connected with @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the following way : @xmath26 for an extended system one needs to preserve the periodicity , therefore the vector external potential must be used .",
    "this makes the problem technically more complicated in comparison to scalar potentials .",
    "however , it can be shown that in situations when the characteristic field frequency is bigger than the level spacing , one can work with scalar potentials instead of vector potentials ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , we shall consider the case when @xmath27 , and for simplicity assume that the electric field is space - independent",
    ". strictly speaking , for external homogeneous fields one needs to use current - tddft in order to study the response of the system.@xcite one then gets the macroscopic current , which allows one to satisfy the periodicity condition . in this paper",
    ", however , we use the usual approximation@xcite where the external homogeneous electric field is described by the following scalar potential : @xmath28    due to the presence of an electric field , the hamiltonian is explicitly time - dependent .",
    "moreover , the hartree and xc potential terms in the hamiltonian become also time - dependent .",
    "such a time - dependent problem is described by the time - dependent ks equation : @xmath29 in the adiabatic approximation , which we use in this paper , the xc potential can be formally obtained from the stationary potentials by assuming that the electron density becomes time - dependent , @xmath30 .",
    "( [ schroedinger2 ] ) must be solved self - consistently together with the corresponding time - dependent particle number equation ( [ n2 ] ) .",
    "since the initially occupied states are the valence states @xmath31 , described by the band index @xmath32 and the momentum @xmath13 , the evolution of the system can be completely described by the time - evolution of these states , i.e. by finding the corresponding time - dependent wave functions @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 , from eq .",

    "as can be seen from these figures , the absorption spectra demonstrate a significant excitonic peak . in particular , the excitonic peak amplitude and the exciton binding energy decrease with increasing valence bandwidth in the slater case ( fig .",

    "in particular , we find that the excitonic features become more pronounced as one passes from kli to slater .",
    "the excitonic effects are defined mainly by the ratio of the coulomb interaction energy to the typical energy of the free system . since in our case",
    "the valence and conduction bands and the gap have the same order of magnitude , we can consider the ratio of the coulomb energy to the valence bandwidth . in the slater approximation",

    "in fact , it is known that the hf approximation gives an overestimated binding energy of excitons ( for a discussion , see ref .  ) .",

    "we have shown that the corresponding system of equations for the matrix elements is a generalization of the sbes , since it allows one to take into account coulomb effects in principle exactly .",
    "this is very important in the case of short pulses and when the system is very small , such as for nanostructures .",
    "another important advantage of this formalism is that it can be applied directly in the time domain , which makes the calculation much faster . as an example",
