    "the presence of a powerful radio source has a profound impact on such an environment : within the dense interstellar medium of the galaxy , the relativistic radio jet drives shocks into the clumpy gas , leading to extreme kinematics ( @xmath10 ; villar - martin , binette and fosbury  1999 ) , additional star formation and the emission line signatures of shock ionisation ( best et al .",

    "the gas is kinematically quiescent ( reflecting purely gravitational motions ) and the continuum from the quasar nucleus is the main source of ionisation ( villar - martin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "new insight into the gaseous haloes of hzrgs came with the discovery by rttgering et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and van ojik et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the majority of small radio sources ( those with projected linear size below 50 ) exhibit spatially resolved absorption in their  profiles , with hi column densities of @xmath11 . for the @xmath12 hzrg 0943242 , binette et al .",

    "this material , they claimed , is a relic reservoir of low metallicity , low density ( @xmath15 ) gas . in larger radio sources , the radio source cocoon plausibly engulfs and pressurises the outer halo entirely , causing it to be seen in emission rather than absorption , and thereby accounting for the anti - correlation between radio source size and the presence of hi absorption found by van ojik et al .",

    "the main absorber is still consistent with an hi column density of @xmath17 , in line with the binette et al .",
    "( 2000 ) model .",
    "in contrast , a very different view of 0200 + 015 emerges : the single absorber with hi column density @xmath18seen at low resolution now splits into two @xmath19  systems ; these extend by more than 15  to obscure addtional  emission coincident with a radio lobe and highly fragmented absorption is also seen on the red wing of the emission line at this position .",
    "the detection of one of the sub - systems in civ suggests that the absorbing gas has undergone substantial metal enrichment , to perhaps as high as @xmath20 .",
    "based on the smaller radio source size in 0943242 ( 26  versus 43  for 0200 + 015 ) , we conjectured that the radio source age ( as inferred from its linear size ) is the parameter controlling the evolution of : ( i ) the structure / kinematics of the absorbing halo , through interaction and shredding of the initially quiescent shells ; ( ii ) its metallicity , through enrichment by starburst superwind triggered concurrently with the nuclear radio source .",
    "if the specific effects of the radio source can be understood , high resolution spectroscopy of such  haloes provides an opportunity to probe the  forest around high - redshift galaxies and hence to test theories for how such systems form out of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . for quasars ,",
    "such attempts are completely hampered by their strong uv continua , which through photoionisation locally reduce the number of  forest clouds below the igm average ( the so - called proximity effect ) . lacking strong line of sight continua ,",
    "radio galaxies offer a more direct probe of the distribution of hi in such dense environments . due to the nature of hierachical clustering",
    ", the opacity of the  forest is expected to increase in the vicinity of massive objects , and observations of background quasars do indeed show excess hi absorption at radii of 15@xmath21  from @xmath22 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( adelberger et al .",
    "however , within @xmath23  there appears to be a deficit of hi , which they attribute to the influence of ` superwind ' outflows from the lbgs . from a theoretical stand - point",
    "it is not clear that superwinds alone can account for this observation , and additional effects such as local photoionization ( bruscoli et al .",
    "2003 ) and the ` filling in ' of absorption with  emission from the lbg itself ( kollmeier et al .",
    "2003 ) may be needed .    in order to address the origin and evolution of the absorbing shells and their connection with the  forest ,",
    "we need to expand our sample of hzrgs with high resolution spectroscopy . for this reason",

    "we present the analysis and interpretation of the new dataset .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we describe the target selection , observations and data reduction , and in section 3 present the  profiles and absorption model fits on an object - by - object basis . in section 4",
    "we compile numerous statistics for the absorption line ensemble and compare them with the properties of hi absorption in the igm . in section 5 , we interpret these results in the light of simulations of : ( i ) expanding radio sources in dense environments ; ( ii ) the  forest around high - redshift galaxies .",
    "section 6 contains our conclusions .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the targets were drawn from the list of @xmath6 radio galaxies compiled from the literature by de breuck et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . once the galaxies invisible from the vlt at the observation epoch were excluded , we imposed the following selection criteria : firstly , that the galaxies be bright enough in  emission for echelle spectroscopy with integration times @xmath28 hours ( slit fluxes of at least @xmath29 ) ; secondly , that the sample comprise radio sources covering projected linear sizes @xmath30  to @xmath31  ( 5 of our 7 targets are in the 2550  range , the range identified by jarvis et al .",
    "2003 as ` critical ' for metal enrichment ) .",
    "for all but one of the targets ( 17556916 ) moderate resolution ( @xmath32 a few  ) spectra exist from which the presence of some  hi absorption is inferred . in the latter respect",
    "they are representative of the general radio galaxy population at these redshifts : we know from van ojik et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that 90 per cent of the smaller ( @xmath33 ) exhibit such absorption , dropping to 25 per cent for larger sources ; the analysis of de breuck et al .",

    "our targets are entirely representative of the known population of radio galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "the new observations were performed with the uves echelle spectrograph on vlt ut2 at the european southern observatory on the nights of 2003 july 26 and 27 . for our targets we used only the red arm of the spectrograph , with cross - disperser 3 and a central wavelength of either 5200 , 5800  or 6250 .",
    "on - chip binning of @xmath37 ( spatial @xmath38 spectral ) was used , resulting in a pixel size of 0.36  arcsec .",
    "the resulting pixel scales in the dispersion direction were in the range 0.050.06 , but spectra were often re - binned to a minimum of 0.1  per pixel to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the slit width was fixed at 1.2  arcsec and its position angle aligned with the radio axis . the observation log is shown in table  1 .",

    "the sub - frames were bias - subtracted , median combined to remove cosmic rays and flat - fielded .",
    "the order - definition frames were used to determine the locations of the orders , which were then extracted and wavelength calibrated using a thar arc .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the blaze function of the grating was determined from the flat - field frame , and then removed from the data before the orders were combined into a single piece of spectrum in the region around redshifted .",

    "we now consider the implications of our results for models of the origin and evolution of the absorption systems and their connection to the radio source and the  forest . in jarvis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we interpreted the results from our pilot study in the context of the model put forward by binette et al . ,",
    "in which the absorbers comprise shells of low density gas , subject to disruption by the expanding radio source and metal enrichment by starburst superwinds . not withstanding these sources of influence",
    ", the clear assumption was that these high column density shells ( @xmath41 ) ultimately had no causal connection with the radio source itself and formed independently of it , as a by - product of massive galaxy formation .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect to see such absorbing shells around young , similiarly massive galaxies at these epochs , prior to the ignition of any nuclear radio source .",
    "the most promising candidates for such a population are the scuba galaxies .",
    "they exhibit the same k ",
    "z relation as the radio galaxies ( serjeant et al .",
    "2003 ) and indeed there is a sizeable overlap between the two populations ( archibald et al .",
    "2001 ; reuland , rttgering & van breugel  2003 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic evidence concerning the existence or otherwise of absorbing haloes around ( non - radio - galaxy ) scuba sources is , however , inconclusive .",
    "chapman et al .  ( 2003 ) have recently obtained keck spectra of 34 scuba sources and find that 10 of them exhibit emission line spectra with a median redshift of @xmath42 , but the spectral resolution ( @xmath43 ) and signal - to - noise level are insufficient to infer the presence of anything but the strongest absorption ( although a few per cent of scuba source do show hints of absorbed ; smail , private communication ) .",
    "higher resolution spectra of these sources are required .",
    "also worthy of such scrutiny are the radio - quiet x - ray type ii quasars , particularly those known to have narrow emission - line spectra similar to those of radio galaxies",
    ". examples of the latter are the @xmath44 source in the chandra deep field south ( norman et al .",
    "2002 ) and the @xmath45 source in the lynx field ( stern et al .",
    "2002 ) , but from existing low resolution spectroscopy it is not clear whether their narrow  emission lines have associated absorption .",
    "larger samples of type ii quasars are becoming available for high resolution spectroscopy from x - ray surveys ( e.g. mainieri et al .  2002 ; gandhi et al .",
    "2004 ) and the the sloan digital sky survey ( zakamska et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "likewise , sauron integral field spectroscopy ( bower et al .",
    "2004 ) shows no evidence for any strong  absorption against steidel ` blob 1 ' , an extended  halo in the @xmath46 ssa22 supercluster , or either of its two nearby lyman break galaxies ( absorbers with @xmath47 can not be detected in these spectra due to resolution and signal : noise limitations ) .",
    "the steidel blobs bear a striking resemblance to the  haloes of hzrgs , but lack central radio sources , although ` blob 1 ' does have an associated scuba source .",
    "the fact that they were discovered by virtue of their high equivalent width  emission is a strong selection effect against absorption .",
    "the lyman break galaxies exhibit a broad distribution of  equivalent width centred at @xmath48  ( shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) , ranging from objects with strong  emission to galaxies with strongly damped absorption .",
    "an example of the latter is the @xmath49 gravitationally - lensed galaxy ms1512cb58 which has absorption with @xmath50  ( savaglio , panagia & padovani  2002 ) .",
    "the velocity offsets between the emission and absorption lines ( stellar and interstellar ) in lyman break galaxies ( e.g. in ms1512cb58 , pettini et al .  2000 , 2002 ; see also shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest that the absorbing gas is in the form of galactic outflow driven by the high star formation rate . an hii galaxy somewhat less massive than the lbgs is the @xmath51 gravitationally - lensed lynx arc ( fosbury et al .",
    "2003 ) , which exhibits an absorbing wind with comparable column densities in hi and civ ( @xmath52 ) , attributed to outflows from @xmath53 o stars .",
    "we conclude that more observations are needed before we can make a definitive statement about the existence or otherwise of absorbing shells around high - redshift galaxies ( not quasars ) which are comparable in mass to the hzrg , but which lack radio - loud agn . for this reason ,",
    "it remains possible that the absorbing shells we see in the hzrgs are a generic by - product of massive galaxy formation , as proposed by binette et al . and assumed by jarvis et al .",
    "there are , however , other models in which the origin of the shells is directly connected to the radio source , which we now discuss .      jarvis et al .  dismissed the possibility that the absorbing gas might take the form of ` shells propagated by the radio source ' , on the grounds that such shells would be : ( i ) disrupted at radii less than the extent of the radio source ; ( ii ) incapable of producing the observed line - of - sight absorption , given that the radio sources are oriented roughly along the plane of the sky .",
    "for such a scenario these reasons are clearly valid .",
    "there is , however , a more natural way in which a radio source can give rise to shells of absorbing gas : a highly supersonic radio jet expanding into the dense medium of a young galaxy will be surrounded by an advancing quasi - spherical bow - shock . immediately behind this shock",
    ", swept - up gas is heated to a few times @xmath54  and radiatively cools to a few times @xmath55 , at which point an appreciable fraction becomes neutral and could be responsible for the observed absorption .",
    "this idea was proposed and investigated in detail by krause  ( 2002 ) . in his radiative hydrodynamical simulations , after a few million years of radio source propagation the shell will provide a neutral column of @xmath56  around the whole radio source , with 98 per cent of the matter displaced by the bow - shock being contained within the shell ( the remaining 2 per cent , or @xmath57 , is entrained within the cocoon and could contribute to the observed line emission ; the hotter material immediately behind the bow - shock contributes negligibly to the observed levels of  emission in hzrgs ) .",
    "the velocity width of the absorbing gas is approximately its internal sound speed , 55  on average in his simulation .",
    "the shells are , however , subject to a number of instabilities .",
    "firstly , the shells are thermally unstable and should fragment into individual sub - shells , which would be preferentially blue - shifted from the main absorber , but almost never by more than 250 .",
    "secondly , the shells are also gravitationally unstable , a process which will , he claims , result in the formation of roughly @xmath55 globular systems each of @xmath58  ( in line with the globular cluster excess seen locally in central cluster galaxies compared with other elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity ) . as the shells fragment ,",
    "their covering factor against the background emission will drop and eventually fall to zero , accounting for the absence of absorption among the larger radio sources in the van ojik et al . sample .    to what extent",
    "can krause s model explain our observations ?",
    "firstly , the spatially - extended nature of the absorbers is consistent with the quasi - spherical bow - shock of the model .",
    "it is clear , however , that hi column densities comparable to his predicted level of @xmath56  could not be seen against  emission in these sources : the damping wings would remove essentially all the emission and render the line undetectable , as fig .",
    "[ fig:0943sim ] illustrates for the case of 0943242 .",
    "therefore , our measurements of column densities @xmath59 reflect a selection bias towards systems with lower column densities , due either to environmental effects or evolution , perhaps due to the initial stages of shell fragmentation .",
    "we note , however , that 21  cm radio observations , which offer a continuum against which to search for hi absorption , can in principle be used to probe the higher @xmath5 regime .",
    "such a search by vermeulen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in a sample of compact ( i.e. young ) radio sources out to @xmath60 revealed absorbing columns of @xmath61 ( for a covering factor of unity and spin temperature 100 ) .",
    "the distribution of 21  cm absorption velocity ( with respect to optical redshift ) is skewed to negative values , with some sources offset by more than 1000 , as we find for our strongest absorber ( in 1338242 ) .",
    "these authors argue , however , that the absorbing material resides in a compact disc - like structure much closer to the nucleus that the  absorbers in the hzrgs . furthermore , attempts to detect 21 cm absorption in hzrgs have been largely unsuccessful ( rttgering et al .",
    "1999 ) , with 0902 + 34 at @xmath62 being the only source with a solid detection ( uson et al .",
    "1991 ; briggs et al .",
    "1993 ; de bruyn et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "; with @xmath5 for this absorber alone increased by factors of 10 and 100 , respectively .",
    "the dashed line is the emission envelope.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as remarked by jarvis et al .",
    ", any model for the absorption systems in hzrgs must also be applicable to radio - loud quasars , by virtue of the orientation - based unification schemes for the two populations .",
    "we therefore compare with the work of baker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) on associated civ absorption in radio - loud quasars .",
    "the incidence of such absorption is higher than in radio - quiet quasars and is preferentially found in steep spectrum and lobe - dominated quasars , implying that the absorbing material lies away from the radio - jet axis ( where it would be strongly influenced by the line of sight uv continuum ) . the absorption strength anti - correlates with the projected linear size of steep spectrum radio sources .",
    "all this is consistent with our results on hzrg absorption and with the krause model . but",
    "using a sample of more luminous radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , vestergaard  ( 2003 ) cast doubt on some of the conclusions of baker et al . , and ascribed the differences to luminosity effects .",
    "in general , however , the lack of information on the spatial extent of the absorbers in quasars leaves open the possibility that some of their absorption arises on much smaller scales than in the krause model , and is more directly associated with the central engine through mechanisms similar to those cited for broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars ( e.g. disk - wind models ) .",
    "for very high - redshift ( @xmath63 ) quasars , barkana & loeb  ( 2003 ) have suggested that hi absorption can be produced as gas cools behind the accretion shock associated with its collapse onto the host dark matter halo .",
    "however , since their fits to the  profiles are poor and the optical depth for such absorption scales as @xmath64 , we do not consider this to be important for our hzrgs .",
    "but what of the absorbers with @xmath65 , are they formed by fragmentation of the larger shells ? the simulations of krause do not have the resolution to follow the evolution of the shells into this regime .",
    "his arguments for fragmentation stem from the application of analytical instability criteria .",
    "the shells are thermally unstable since the sound crossing time through the newly - formed shell ( @xmath66 ) exceeds the cooling time ( @xmath67 ) . thus on the latter timescale",
    ", one would expect the shells to fragment by a factor of @xmath68 in column density [ gravitational instability proceeds much more slowly , on timescales of a few @xmath54 ] .",
    "however , it is not clear how the _ neutral _ column density will evolve as the shells fragment . for a uniform slab in photoionization equilibrium with a diffuse uv radiation field",
    ", the neutral fraction will decrease rapidly as the degree of fragmentation increases , and eventually drop to zero when the shell thickness becomes comparable to the strmgren depth . in the present case , however , we are dealing with a collisionally ionized , cooling ( i.e. non - equilibrium ) plasma to which these arguments are not applicable .",
    "therefore , short of performing detailed simulations , we can not exclude the possibility that some of the @xmath65 absorbers are fragments of initially larger shells .",
    "however , for the following reasons we believe that low column density absorbers are a distinct population , not formed by fragmentation of the larger shells : ( i ) there appear to be no absorbers in the 3 order of magnitude wide gap from @xmath70 , an absence which would be surprising unless fragmentation were very rapid in this regime ; ( ii ) the velocities of the @xmath65 absorbers bear no obvious relation to the higher @xmath5 systems  krause expects the fragments to be preferentially blue - shifted , but by no more than 250 ; ( iii ) with respect to the  emission redshift , the @xmath65 absorbers show a velocity dispersion comparable to that expected for a proto - cluster  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : voff ] ) ; ( iv ) the @xmath65 absorbers follow the same @xmath71 relation as the igm -forest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b_nh ] ) ; ( v ) the observed number of @xmath65 systems in each galaxy is within a factor of 24 ( at most ) of the number expected in the igm at large ( table  4 ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the low column density absorbers are part of the population that gives rise to the  forest in the igm , albeit modified by the massive galaxy / protocluster environment , as discussed below .",
    "there is now direct evidence that high - redshift radio galaxies reside in proto - cluster environments : narrow - band  imaging and follow - up spectroscopy has confirmed the existence of overdensities of  emitters within @xmath28  of 6 hzrgs at @xmath72 , by factors 415 with respect to blank fields ( kurk et al .",
    "2000 ; pentericci et al .",
    "2000 ; venemans et al .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the proto - clusters decrease from @xmath73  at @xmath74 to @xmath75  at @xmath76 ( kurk et al .",
    "the overdensity around 1338 - 242 at @xmath77 is very irregular , with the radio galaxy situated off - centre , suggesting that the structure has barely separated from the hubble flow .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath78 proto - cluster around 1138 - 262 shows evidence for segregation between the various galaxy populations ( -emitters , h@xmath79 emitters and eros ) , indicative of an older , more dynamically relaxed structure ( kurk et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict an increase in the opacity of the  forest in the vicinity of massive galaxies ( e.g. croft et al .",
    "2002 ; bruscoli et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , which show that @xmath83 increases to 0.9 within 0.5  of @xmath85 lyman - break galaxies .",
    "we note that savaglio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) analysed the ly@xmath79 forest towards the @xmath49 lyman break galaxy ms1512-cb58 , and found evidence for excess absorption with respect to qso sightlines at a co - moving distance of @xmath86 .",
    "however , the presence of strongly damped  absorption prevented them from analysing the properties of the forest closer into the galaxy .",
    "our results can not be interpreted in the same theoretical framework as those of adelberger et al . because our absorption statistics are in redshift space along the line - of - sight , not in real space perpendicular to it . at @xmath87 and 4",
    "the hubble parameter has values of @xmath88 , 310 and 430 , respectively , so given an intrinsic  linewidth of @xmath89  we are sensitive to ( at the most ) @xmath90 and 3.5  in redshift space , and around half these values if the  peak is at the systemic velocity since we can only see absorption from foreground material .",
    "on such scales around a massive galaxy ( @xmath91/@xmath92 ) at @xmath85 , peculiar velocities will be up to 150  ( bruscoli et al .",
    "it will be of interest to compare our average @xmath83 values given in table  3 ( as well as  profiles and probability density functions of transmitted flux ) with new simulations of the  forest in the vicinity of massive galaxies _ along the line - of - sight _ , and at a variety of epochs .",
    "the intriguing possibility remains that the simulations may reveal that all the  absorption in hzrgs can be accounted for by the  forest , with the strong absorbers ( @xmath1 ) in fact being a superposition of several weaker systems .",
    "the observed evolution in proto - cluster properties ( velocity dispersion , dynamical segregation ) from @xmath76 to @xmath74 , suggests that for our lower - z targets it may be more appropriate to think of the hi absorption as a probe of the proto - intracluster medium , rather than of the igm ( although at some point the distinction is purely semantic ) .",
    "zhan , fang & burnstein  ( 2003 ) have recently argued that the proto - intracluster medium at @xmath6 is likely to be significantly multiphased and similar to the spiral - rich group environment at lower redshift . at such epochs supernova heating",
    "is insufficient to heat the icm to @xmath93  globally , and it more likely consists of pockets of metal - rich gas at @xmath94 . from the lowest value of the transmitted flux found by adelberger et al .",

    "our measured column densities are therefore consistent with a multiphase icm at these redshifts .",
    "we have built on our successful pilot study and increased the number of high - redshift radio galaxies with uves echelle spectroscopy of  from 2 to 7 . with this enlarged ensemble of absorption systems we can begin to make some inferences about their origin .",
    "the new spectra demonstrate once again that hi absorption is more complex when seen at this much higher resolution : several absorbers identified in low - resolution spectra with @xmath1  now fragment into a number of much weaker systems with @xmath2 .",
    "there appears to be a gap in the @xmath5 distribution , as we identify strong absorbers with @xmath99  and weaker systems with @xmath100 , but none at intermediate @xmath5 .",
    "we discussed the origin of the strong absorption systems with @xmath1  in the framework put forward by krause  ( 2002 ) , based on radio source physics .",
    "a highly supersonic jet expanding into a dense proto - galactic medium will be surrounded by a quasi - spherical bow shock .",
    "the simulations by krause  ( 2002 ) show that the cooling of post - shock material will lead to neutral column densities comparable to those observed , and that due to instabilities the shells will fragment and offer much less absorption towards larger radio sources .",
    "the model provides a very natural explanation for the observation that the shells have high covering factors and surround the entire galaxy . appealing",
    "though it is , it would be premature to enshrine it as the canonical model for the strong absorbers in hzrgs .",
    "several new challenging observations are needed before we can determine whether such strong absorbers really are produced by the radio source bow shock or whether they are instead a by - product of massive galaxy formation .",
    "firstly , in the hzrgs themselves deep , high resolution spectra should be obtained of the faint kinematically - quiescent  haloes , identified by villar - martin et al .",
    "secondly , such spectroscopy should also be obtained of a carefully selected sample of comparably massive high - redshift galaxies without radio - loud agn , comprising scuba galaxies and narrow - line x - ray type ii quasars .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that some of the lower column density systems with @xmath101  form by fragmentation of larger shells until the simulations of the bow - shock absorbers are extended into this regime .",
    "the rate of incidence of such absorption in our spectra and their distribution on the @xmath102@xmath5 plane suggests , however , that these systems could be part of the igm  forest population .",
    "simulations predict that the opacity of the forest should increase within a few mpc  of a massive galaxy at these epochs .",
    "our results show an enhancement ( by factors 24 ) in the number of  forest systems ( relative to the igm ) at @xmath103 and a deficit by similar factors in the two @xmath104 systems , although on the grounds of small number statistics we do not claim that this implies evolution over this redshift interval . for a proper comparison",
    ", independent of any voigt fitting uncertainties and systematics , new simulations of the  forest should be performed . unlike those in the literature which predict the hi opacity at the galaxy redshift as a function of transverse distance from it",
    ", the new simulations should yield the  forest along the line of sight to a massive object in redshift space , as a function of galaxy mass and epoch . in lieu of this",
    ", we note that the observed column densities are consistent with simple estimates for a multiphase proto - intracluster medium at @xmath6 .",
