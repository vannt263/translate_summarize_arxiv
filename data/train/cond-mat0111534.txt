    "we found that 20 molecular dynamics steps with a time step of 0.1 gave a consistently good performance for all of the temperatures of interest .",
    "for these values of the parameters , the acceptance ratio , which depends on how well the energy is conserved by the approximate integration of newton s equations , turns out to be nearly independent of temperature and between 85% and 90% for the @xmath92 lattice .",
    "note that this acceptance ratio does depend on the size of the system , because the energy is an extensive quantity , and decreases as the system size increases .",
    "other parameters of the algorithm that must be set are the number of thermalization steps taken before any measurements and how many steps of the algorithm are necessary to generate statistically independent measurements .",
    "while these parameters can be different for different observables , we have looked at the average value of the action , eq .",

    "looking at the monte carlo time series of values of @xmath97 and @xmath44 $ ] , we found that 10,000 thermalization steps of the hybrid monte carlo algorithm were adequate to equilibrate the system for our @xmath92 lattice .",
    "the number of steps of the sampling procedure necessary to generate statistically independent measurements was determined by the standard data blocking procedure .",
    "the values of the observables are averaged over 1,2,3, ... n consecutive hybrid monte carlo steps and the variance computed .",

    "note that the parameters of the algorithm need not be the same for each temperature .",
    "the correlation and thermalization times are smaller at high temperatures . but given that by far the most time consuming part of the simulations is the calculation of the electronic observables , any fine tuning of the hybrid monte carlo sampling procedure would only lead to marginally small gains in computer time .",
    "we carried out simulations at 11 temperatures starting with 0.5 t progressively reducing the temperature down to 0.25 t . except for the highest temperature ,",
    "the initial configuration was taken as an equilibrium configuration of the previous simulation .",
    "each of the runs consisted of 1024 sample configurations with 100 hybrid mc steps between successive measurements .",
    "the calculations were carried out on 64 processors of an ibm sp parallel computer , using a different seed of the random number generator on each processor .",

    "close to and below @xmath6 , this is not sufficiently long for the system to sample configurations with positive and negative values of @xmath96 during a run and thus the system is trapped near one of the two peaks ( @xmath98 or @xmath95 ) of the probability distribution @xmath89 $ ] , eq .",
    "( [ five ] ) . since one expects the system to end up in a state with @xmath98 or @xmath95 with equal probability as the temperature is lowered , on average one ought to sample configurations with @xmath94 on half of the processors and configurations with @xmath95 on the other half .",
    "the data analysis was carried out with the multiple histogram technique of ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite .",
    "this technique uses the information available from all of the runs and allows one to obtain values for the observables for any temperature in the range covered by the simulations .",
    "but it requires the range of energies sampled from simulations at neighboring temperatures to overlap and this determined the number of runs ( 11 ) that we carried out .",
    "the statistical error estimates were obtained with the bootstrap method .",
    "our simulation data was resampled 128 times , which allows an estimation of the error bars to a bit better that 10% .",
    "the multiple histogram calculation of the partition functions and observables must be repeated for each bootstrap sample and the statistical errors obtained as the variance of the 128 multiple histogram values of the observables . with 1024 samples ,",
    "the statistical errors were typically of the order of 1% in the spectral function @xmath12 and 0.3% in the density of states @xmath2 and the optical conductivity @xmath3 .",

    "the peierls - cdw rms gap @xmath103 is of order @xmath5 for the parameters we have selected .",

    ".  2 @xcite . here",
    ", one sees that as the temperature is lowered from @xmath114 towards @xmath6 , the peierls - cdw correlation length exceeds @xmath106 as @xmath6 is approached .",
    "we also see that this occurs at a higher temperature for quasi - particles moving in the [ 1,0 ] direction ( @xmath115 ) than for quasi - particles moving in the [ 1,1 ] direction ( @xmath116 ) as expected .",
    "turning now to the electronic properties , we first look at the single particle density of states @xmath2 given by eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) .",
    "results for @xmath117 @xmath118 for various values of the temperature are shown in fig .  3 and a three - dimensional plot of @xmath117 versus @xmath118 and @xmath102",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the lattice fluctuations at the higher temperatures have wiped out the van hove peak . as the temperature is decreased and the peierls - cdw correlation length exceeds the quasi - particle thermal correlation length , coherence peaks appear in @xmath117 .",
    "this behavior is similar to what has been found for the 2d hubbard model near half - filling as @xmath102 goes towards zero and the antiferromagnetic correlation length exceeds the thermal quasi - particle length @xcite .    in figs 5a and",
    "5b we show the single - particle spectral weights @xmath119 for @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively . again , at higher temperatures , the thermal lattice fluctuations give rise to a broad peak in these spectral weights , due to the static random nature of the lattice displacements .",
    "as the temperature is lowered and the lattice displacement correlation length increases , coherent quasi - particle peaks , associated with the peierls - cdw phase which onsets at @xmath6 are clearly seen .",
    "a careful examination shows that these coherence peaks appear at a higher temperature for @xmath122 than for @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the peierls - cdw gap appears to open first at the @xmath123 region of the fermi surface and then at a lower temperature for the diagonal @xmath124 region .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the peierls - cdw correlation length first exceeds the @xmath122 quasi - particle thermal correlation length , as seen in fig .  2 .    in fig",
    "7 , we plot the static spin susceptibility @xmath125 versus @xmath102 .",
    "as the temperature decreases towards @xmath6 , @xmath125 clearly shows the development of a pseudogap . finally , turning to the real part of the conductivity , we have plotted @xmath3 @xmath118 and @xmath102 in fig .  7 .",
    "as noted , the area under @xmath3 should be equal to @xmath126 times the @xmath76-kinetic energy per site .",
    "if the integral of @xmath3 over @xmath118 is performed analytically for each monte carlo configuration , this sum rule is satisfied to within statistical errors .",
    "the thermally randomized lattice gives rise to elastic scattering at higher temperatures .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the pseudogap in the quasi - particle spectrum gives rise to a shift in @xmath3 spectral weight from low frequencies to frequencies above @xmath127 .",
    "the electronic properties of a 2d electron - phonon model which undergoes a commensurate peierls - cdw transition have been studied within a static approximation which takes into account only the @xmath29 matsubara fluctuations of the lattice . using a monte carlo calculation based upon a phenomenological ising - like form for the lattice displacements , the effect of these classical thermal lattice fluctuations on the one - electron density of states , the single particle spectral weight , the spin susceptibility and the optical conductivity were determined .",
    "each of these quantities shows evidence of a depletion of low - energy electronic degrees of freedom as a pseudogap opens .    for the parameters which we have chosen ,",
    "@xmath128 is of order the lattice spacing so that the important lengths for this 2d lattice are the thermal quasi - particle length and the peierls - cdw correlation length @xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered toward @xmath6 , the peierls - cdw correlation length first exceeds the thermal quasi - particle correlation length for electrons near @xmath129 and a pseudogap begins to open over the parts of the fermi surface associated with the van hove singularity of the non - interacting system .",
    "then as the temperature is further decreased , a temperature is reached such that @xmath130 exceeds the thermal quasi - particle coherence length for the diagonal @xmath131 region and a pseudogap is opened over the entire fermi surface .",
    "this continuous depletion of the single particle density of states at the fermi energy appears as a suppression of the pauli spin susceptibility .",
    "in addition , spectral weight in the optical conductivity is shifted from lower frequencies to higher frequencies , eventually appearing as a peak above @xmath132 , resembling @xmath3 in the ordered peierls - cdw phase .    while the results we have presented are in agreement with various theoretical and numerical expectations , we believe that this numerical method which takes into account the @xmath29 matsubara fluctuations represents a useful approach to a more detailed understanding of the electronic properties of a 2d electron - phonon system as a commensurate second order phase transition is approached . from a diagramatic point of view , it sums all feynman graphs associated with @xmath29 phonon propagators .",
    "the finite matsubara frequency phonons renormalize the parameters a , b , and c in the action , but it is the @xmath29 fluctuations that dominate the behavior as @xmath133 . by treating a , b , and c phenomenologically , we are able to run the simulation on substantially larger lattices than previous quantum monte carlo simulations of the holstein model . this has allowed us a more detailed look at the manner in which the electronic properties are effected as the peierls - cdw transition is approached .",
