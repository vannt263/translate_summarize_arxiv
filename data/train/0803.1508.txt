    "we start with some integrals involving the absolute values of the logarithm of the zeta function . as far as we know , the first work in this direction is due to wang , who discovered a rh criterium involving these integrals @xcite .",
    "more recent pioneering works are due to volchkov @xcite who found an integral relation on the complex plane with two variables equivalent to the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) .",
    "later balazard , saias and yor @xcite , established another equivalence to the rh by an integral involving only one variable i.e. by integration on the critical line . in a subsequent treatment by one of us",
    "the analytical computations were extended to every line perpendicular to the _ x _ axis to obtain an equivalence to the rh involving explicitly @xmath0 , with the appearance of a shift along the real axis of exactly @xmath1 @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we first extend some of the above mentioned treatments by introducing a more general lorentz measure which we are free to normalize in order to obtain more simple formulas i.e. : @xmath2    so that @xmath3 .    then following the same calculation as in @xcite",
    ", we may establish the following starting formula ( equivalent to the rh , too ) which reads : @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is supposed to be a positive function of @xmath7 in particular an absolute value .",
    "we remark , ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] ) has been calculated supposing rh is true and moreover it is equivalent to rh .",
    "( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] ) contains a shift of amount @xmath6 and is more rich then the previous established formulas since many choices of the function @xmath6 are possible and a special choice of it may be more convenient for the calculations .    then since ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath8    we have @xmath9    for the special choice @xmath10 , in the critical strip ( @xmath11 ) we then obtain @xmath12 . indeed , this statement holds also for @xmath13 when it is nothing else than the balazard - saias - yor equality @xmath14 @xcite . on the other hand : @xmath15    and we define now : @xmath16    we now make a more specific choice and set @xmath17 and @xmath10 in the critical strip , thus @xmath18 ( @xmath19 in the critical strip ) . outside the critical strip",
    "we may choose @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 written below as a function of @xmath24 constitute the first theorem of this note .",
    "[ xref - theorem-2121326 ] @xmath25 @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the euler - mascheroni constant .    the above formulas are equivalent to the rh . with the choice we have considered ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath28 both diverge at @xmath29 i.e. at the right border of the critical strip .",
    "we note that @xmath22 may be seen as a potential .",
    "numerical computations concerning ( [ xref - equation-213225656 ] ) and ( [ xref - equation-21322575 ] ) of theorem [ xref - theorem-2121326 ] may be done and presented as an illustration but from the known numerical results on the zeros , the two functions are exact up to @xmath30 in the critical strip and exact outside the critical strip .",
    "so we omit here a numerical computation which will be presented below for another case concerning the `` hidden symmetry '' which we now introduce .    from ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] )",
    "it is easily seen that another simple choices of @xmath6 give rise to a potential @xmath31 of ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] ) without any divergence .",
    "we simply mention the case @xmath32 where ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] ) gives : @xmath33    we then continue to establish another theorem which on the rh expresses a kind of `` hidden symmetry '' . to do this",
    "it is more convenient to consider the potential @xmath31 above instead of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath31 is in fact a function of @xmath24 which is not injective and we may ask for what ( @xmath24 , @xmath34 ) the potential is the same that is @xmath35 .",
    "we reconsider ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] ) and set ( in the critical strip as before ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath19",
    ". then from ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] ) we have for @xmath38 : @xmath39    a very simple formula for the potential inside the critical strip . for the potential outside ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] )",
    "gives : @xmath40    where we have set @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we now observe that @xmath43 of ( [ xref - equation-210235740 ] ) is increasing with @xmath24 while @xmath44 from ( [ xref - equation-210235848 ] ) is decreasing with @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath31 is not injective in the interval [ @xmath46 [ ; this suggest the following definition .",
    "the `` hidden symmetry '' is defined by the solution @xmath47 of the equation : @xmath48    where we write for the unique solution @xmath49 .",
    "we are still free to define for any @xmath19 the map : @xmath50    and thus @xmath51 outside the critical strip , so that @xmath52 .",
    "moreover : @xmath53    we may also write : @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the the mbius function of argument _",
    "n_.     returning to ( [ xref - equation-29183221 ] ) we have that : @xmath56    with the variable change @xmath57 which maps the line @xmath58 in the unit circle i.e. @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , we obtain : @xmath61    inside the critical strip . outside the critical strip , using the choice written above we obtain : @xmath62    where @xmath24 , @xmath34 are related by ( [ xref - equation-21201724 ] ) .",
    "thus the integral along the vertical line of abscissa @xmath63 is the same as along the vertical line of abscissa @xmath64 as long as @xmath65 if rh is true and vice versa .",
    "we may now formulate the second theorem expressing such an equivalence .",
    "notice that in the above formulas the lorentz measure is now disappeared and the `` hidden symmetry '' appears as a global axial symmetry i.e. which is not pointwise but which is related to an important arithmetical function given by ( [ xref - equation-21201724 ] ) above .",
    "the rh is equivalent to the existence of a `` hidden symmetry '' given by:[xref - theorem-212145 ] @xmath66    where @xmath67    or written in another way : @xmath54    moreover @xmath48    in ( [ xref - equation-2120580 ] ) and ( [ xref - equation-21205816 ] ) , the zeta function appears itself , through @xmath24 and @xmath68 or only @xmath24 , as argument of the zeta function of complex argument , by means of the primes .",
    "it may be added that a part the scaling factor @xmath69 on the vertical line ( the same outside as well as inside the critical strip ) the `` hidden symmetry '' says that for any @xmath19 , the potential of a test charged vertical filament placed inside the critical strip at the position @xmath70 is the same as that of the filament placed outside the critical strip at the position @xmath71 , where @xmath24 , @xmath34 are related by ( [ xref - equation-21201724 ] ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the formulation given by theorem [ xref - theorem-212145 ] , even if equivalent to the rh , is new .",
    "it has an electrostatic interpretation and go more in the direction to believe that the rh my be true .",
    "as an illustration of the kind of convergence in the numerical treatment , we treat a special case below and add the plots of the two corresponding periodic functions for a special value of @xmath24 .",
    "we now perform a numerical experiment and consider the case where @xmath72 . then up to some decimals",
    "we find that @xmath73 and so @xmath74 . so for this special choice of @xmath24 , the values of the potential @xmath31 are the same at @xmath75 ( in the critical strip ) and at @xmath76 ( outside the critical strip ) .",
    "we first give the plots of the two functions to integrate in ( [ xref - equation-2120580 ] ) and ( [ xref - equation-21205816 ] ) as a function of @xmath77 ( up to @xmath78 ) , to show the periodicity .    ) [ blue ] and in ( [ xref - equation-21205816 ] ) [ red ] ]    integration of the two functions from @xmath79 to @xmath80 gives for the first the value @xmath81 and for the second the value @xmath82 .",
    "we know the last value should converge unconditionally to @xmath83 .",
    "this illustrate the kind of convergence involved . notice that in both cases the `` height '' of integration is given by @xmath84 , which corresponds to consider the first 37 non trivial zeros of the zeta function .    $ ] ]    finally , we present the plot of the potentials @xmath85 and @xmath86 which illustrate the divergence at the right border of the critical strip ( @xmath87 )",
    ". we may also consider the `` electrical field '' inside and outside the critical strip which we define here as : @xmath88    figure 3 summarizes the example we presented .     and @xmath89 where the slopes of the two tangent straight lines are given by the magnitude of the corresponding `` electrical field '' defined by ( [ xref - equation-2172124 ] ) ]    notice that a slightly different definition of the electrical field i.e. if defined as the gradient of the potential @xmath31 with respect to the position @xmath7 ( keeping @xmath6 constant ) gives the following : @xmath90    moreover with our choice we obtain : @xmath91",
    "in this work we have first extended some integral formulas for the logarithm of the zeta function  by means of more general lorentz measures and obtained two new relations equivalent to the rh .",
    "then we have introduced a kind of `` hidden symmetry '' which relates the integrals between two values of the abscissa , one inside the other outside the critical strip .",
    "a simple numerical experiment has been presented as illustration of the kind of convergence involved .",
    "we note , the truth of such a symmetry is still equivalent to the truth of the rh , but in the new formulation we have found , there is the appearance of the primes into the critical strip by means of the zeta function calculated outside the critical strip .",
    "the above symmetry is weaker then the stronger riemann symmetry @xcite which for the xi  function is given pointwise by @xmath92 for any complex argument _ s _ of the zeta function .",
    "our weaker symmetry connects the interval [ @xmath93 [ in the critical strip with the infinite interval ] @xmath94 [ outside the critical strip .",
    "the work will be continued with the study of new integral relations  with a more general class of `` measure '' in the integration of the logarithm of the zeta function @xcite .",
