    "the anais experiment aims to a model independent confirmation of the positive dark matter ( dm ) signal reported by the dama / nai@xcite and dama / libra@xcite experiments , that have observed an annually modulated event rate in the very low energy range ( from 2 - 6 kevee ) , as expected from a dm particle component in the galactic halo , and whose characteristics are very hard to mimic by known backgrounds . in order to confirm this signal",
    ", anais will install @xmath2100  kg of nai(tl ) scintillator detectors in the canfranc underground laboratory ( lsc , spain ) .",
    "this paper starts with a brief description of the anais prototypes that have served to characterize and improve the detectors in the past years ( section [ sec : prototypes ] ) , and then a review of the detectors performance achieved so far ( section [ sec : performance ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : prospects ] the experiment status and its prospects in terms of sensitivity to annual modulation are discussed .",
    "in an extensive effort to achieve the best detector performance , several prototypes have been tested at lsc in the last years .",
    "anais0@xcite , a single 9.6  kg saint - gobain crystal , allowed for a valuable understanding of the different background contributions@xcite , estimate of nai(tl ) slow scintillation constants@xcite , and the establishment of the basis for the bulk event data selection protocols used in the subsequent experiments@xcite .",
    "the anais25 setup@xcite , operated from december 2012 until march 2015 , consisted in two 12.5  kg cylindrical ( 4.75   @xmath311.75  length ) nai(tl ) crystals made by alpha spectra ( as ) , and labeled as d0 and d1 in the following ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : anais37 ] left ) .",
    "each module was coupled to two photomultipliers ( pmts ) through quartz windows , without light guides to improve light collection and was equipped with a mylar window in the lateral face of the copper encapsulation .",
    "this window allows to calibrate the detectors in the very low energy region with external sources ( @xmath4co and @xmath5cd ) , that are mounted along flexible wires and introduced into the shielding through a closed rn - free tube . as it will be shown in the next section , the modules design proved to be very efficient in terms of light collection , and has been adopted for the final experiment .",
    "the detectors were enclosed in a 30  cm lead shielding plus anti - radon box and active vetoes .",
    "the same setup was used to test a new module produced by as with improved protocols in order to reduce internal contaminants .",
    "the new module , labeled as d2 , was installed at lsc between the anais25 ones , in a new setup called anais37 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : anais37 ] right ) . as concerns",
    "the photomultipliers , hamamatsu r12669sel2 have been selected for their low background characteristics and high quantum efficiency ( @xmath632% ) .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )",
    "we determine the light collection in anais modules by a fully characterization of the pmts single electron response ( ser)@xcite . then , the number of photoelectrons ( phe ) collected per energy unit is obtained by dividing the mean value of the charge distribution corresponding to a known energy deposition in the detector ( usually 22.6  kev from a calibration with @xmath5cd source ) by the mean value of the ser charge distribution . we can report an excellent light collection efficiency in all the as modules characterized with this method : around 15 phe / kev ( see first column in tab .  [ tab : internalcont ] ) , that represents twice the value obtained for the anais0 prototype .",
    "this result points to a lower energy threshold in the as modules with respect to that of the anais0 prototype , set to 2  kevee@xcite .",
    "in fact the 0.9  kev energy deposition following ec decay in @xmath7na ( an internal contaminant of cosmogenic origin ) is clearly visible in the anais37 detectors energy spectra when the corresponding line from the daughter nucleus de - excitation ( 1274.5  kev ) is detected in another module .",
    "we are still working in the evaluation of the efficiency at this very low energy line , because the event rate in this region is greatly dominated by noise events whose origin is not bulk scintillation@xcite .",
    ".light collected and main internal contaminations measured in anais prototypes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      all the external components ( copper housing , quartz windows , pmts , near electronics , shielding , .. ) have been screened for radiopurity at lsc by hpge spectroscopy , obtaining only upper limits in most cases .",
    "the most limiting elements are the pmts , but our monte carlo simulations show that the resulting background below 10  kevee is at 0.1  cpd / kev / kg level , being the contamination of the detector itself the dominant contribution@xcite .",
    "both anais25 and anais37 setups started taking data very soon after their installation underground , therefore they produced valuable information regarding cosmogenic isotopes activated in the nai powder / crystal during the crystal growing and mounting stages@xcite .",
    "most of those isotopes are short - living and not dangerous for the experiment , except @xmath7na and @xmath8h . apart from that ,",
    "the most important internal contaminants are @xmath9k and @xmath0pb .",
    "the former can be determined by studying the coincidence between a 3.2  kev energy deposition in one crystal and 1460.8  kev on another one .",
    "the latter can be identified by alpha spectroscopy , profiting from the different scintillation constant of alpha and beta / gamma particles .",
    "the last two columns of tab .",
    "[ tab : internalcont ] show the activity identified for these two isotopes for the three as modules in comparison with that of anais0 .",
    "a clear reduction in @xmath9k contamination can be reported , with a present level of @xmath21  mbq / kg corresponding to around 40  ppb natural potassium , but a higher level of @xmath0pb content with respect to the saint gobain crystals was noticed in the first two modules .",
    "after a careful revision of the crystal growing and handling protocols the problem was partially solved in the d2 detector .",
    "further reduction in the next modules is being pursued , collaborating with as in the improvement of all the purification / growing / handling protocols .",
    "the corresponding reduction in the low energy background level of d2 with respect to d0 and d1 is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkg ] left .",
    "successful background models have been developed for the anais0 and anais25 setups down to 3 kev@xcite .",
    "the background model of d2 in anais37 is still under construction . as can be checked in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkg ] right , the measured background is well accounted for above 20  kev but some background contributions at low energy should still be properly identified .",
    "work is in progress in order to better understand this background .",
    "a new more radiopure as module is expected to arrive at lsc in january 2016 , and 5 more modules will arrive along 2016 , to start taking data with 112.5  kg nai(tl ) in a 3@xmath103 matrix configuration by the second half of 2016 .",
    "a sketch of the full experiment is shown if fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] left .",
    "the shielding will consist of 10  cm of archaeological lead , 20  cm of low activity lead , 40 cm of neutron moderator , an anti - radon box , and an active muon veto system made up of plastic scintillators covering top and sides of the whole setup .",
    "active veto system , data acquisition and analysis software and slow control system are fully commissioned at lsc .",
    "the @xmath7na and @xmath9k contributions in the low energy region can be substantially reduced tagging those events by the detection of the high energy gammas emitted simultaneously .",
    "the background reduction power of the 3x3 matrix working in anticoincidence can be considerably increased by surrounding the detectors with a liquid scintillator functioning as active veto .",
    "we are working in the evaluation of the possibilities of such a system and its feasibility in the context of the anais project .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] right we present the projected sensitivity ( spin independent ) to dm annual modulation of the experiment in the conservative scenario described above , supposing 100  kg of nai(tl ) , 5 years of data taking and the background already achieved . in the calculation , we have considered helm form factors , a standard halo model ( isothermal sphere ) with @xmath11=0.3  gev / cm@xmath8 , @xmath13=220  km / s and @xmath14=650  km / s , quenching factors 0.3 for na and 0.1 for i , and an energy window to look for the modulated signal from 1 to 6  kevee . even in this conservative scenario , a 90% c.l . positive signal",
    "would be obtained in 90% of the carried out experiments for most of the dama / libra singled - out dm parameter space .    in summary , good quality nai(tl )",
    "detectors from as have been fully characterized , showing an outstanding light collection and 1  kevee energy threshold at reach .",
    "the potassium content is around 40 ppb , and @xmath0pb bulk contamination is at 0.7 mbq / kg level , that means a factor 5 improvement with respect to previous prototypes .",
    "further improvement in both isotopes is expected in next modules .",
    "anais foresees to start taking data with 112.5  kg along 2016 , with good sensitivity prospects for exploring the dama / libra signal even under very conservative assumptions .",
