    "dynamical symmetry breaking is a general behavior in nature and is observed in many field of physics .",
    "for example , phase transitions are often related to a dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition in infinite matter may be viewed as breaking of translational invariance which is related to mechanical instability of the system against small density fluctuations inside the spinodal zone .",
    "the spinodal instability may provide a possible mechanism for triggering the fragmentation of a hot piece of nuclear matter produced in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the composite system formed in the overlap zone of the colliding ions expands and cools down .",
    "depending on the initial compression and temperature , it may enter the unstable region of the phase diagram .",
    "in such a scenario , the fragment formation takes place by a rapid growth of density fluctuations in the spinodal region .",
    "such a scenario is valid for infinite matter or a finite system . in matter ,",
    "unstable modes are sound modes characterized by plane waves , whereas in a finite system these are collective vibrations associated with density fluctuations with multipolarity @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for example , a spherical system can break into pieces as soon as the collective mode with multipolarity @xmath0 larger than one becomes unstable .",
    "stochastic one - body transport models provides a suitable framework for a theoretical description of the collision process all the way from the initial stage up to the final state involving development of large density fluctuations and formation of fragments @xcite .",
    "this approach in a semi - classical approximation for the phase - space density , which is frequently referred as the boltzmann - langevin model , has been applied to investigate the spinodal decomposition of nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "stochastic time dependent hartree fock ( stdhf ) approaches are now under development in order to take into account the quantal nature of single particle motion @xcite .",
    "a valuable insight on dynamical symmetry breaking , and the role of quantal and statistical fluctuations on the instabilities can be gained by investigating the early development of density fluctuations .",
    "the linear response treatment of the one - body stochastic transport models , in semi - classical or quantal framework , provides a useful basis for this purpose . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the dominant collective modes in an expanding finite nuclear system are identified in a linear response treatment by solving temperature dependent quantal rpa equation , and the properties of these collective modes are investigated as a function of dilution of the system .",
    "these calculations illustrate that , as the system expands , the collective modes which were all stable at normal density , become softer until their energies become zero and then bifurcate toward the imaginary values , signaling the instability of the corresponding mode .",
    "the density fluctuations associated with the collective degrees of freedom can be determined in terms of collective transport equations .",
    "these transport equations for the collective variables can be deduced from the microscopic transport models by projecting the equation of motion onto a specific collective mode @xcite , or can be derived by some other means @xcite . since , the standard one - body transport approach provides a classical description of the collective motion , the deduced collective models are best suited at high excitation energies when the temperature is much larger than the typical frequencies of the collective motion . on the other hand , when the characteristic energies of the collective modes are comparable with or larger than temperature of the system , the quantal fluctuations of the collective dynamics become important or even dominant .",
    "then , a quantum transport approach of the collective variables is required for describing dynamics of large density fluctuations",
    ". the stochastic one - body transport description can be improved by incorporating the memory effects associated with finite duration of binary collisions . as demonstrated in a recent work @xcite , in such non - markovian description , transport properties of collective motion evolve in accordance with the quantal fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a single collective mode , specifically the quadru- pole moment of the fluctuating density in an expanding nuclear system and study its evolution by employing collective transport models , in both classical and quantal forms .",
    "although these models can be derived from the underlying microscopic transport models in markovian and non - markovian forms , we follow a phenomenological approach and parameterize the basic ingredients of the model in accordance with the recent tdhf calculations for expansion of a hot spherical system @xcite , and the rpa calculations for describing the unstable collective modes @xcite . in the fokker - planck approach ,",
    "the coupling between the collective mode and the intrinsic degrees of freedom is described in terms of friction and diffusion coefficients .",
    "this simple but realistic model allows us to calculate the development of fluctuations associated with the collective mode during the expansion of the nuclear system , and to investigate the role of quantal and statistical fluctuations in the dynamics of the symmetry breaking .",
    "combining the results of the finite temperature tdhf description of the expansion of hot nuclear sources ref . @xcite and the rpa investigation of the stability of a finite hot expanding nuclear source @xcite , we can determine the most important collective modes and describe their transitions from stable to unstable configurations as a function of expansion , temperature and source size . here",
    ", we specifically consider evolution of the quadrupole shape fluctuations in an expanding spherical hot nuclear source . according to finite temperature tdhf calculations with initial temperatures in the range of @xmath2 mev , the system executes monopole vibrations and cools down by particle evaporation .",
    "depending on the size of the source and the initial temperature , it takes between @xmath3 fm / c and @xmath4 fm / c to reach the maximum dilution that occurs typically around @xmath5 of the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "according to the constraint rpa calculations , the quadrupole mode with an initial frequency @xmath6 , which is found to be about @xmath7 mev @xmath8 at moderate temperature , becomes softer as the system expands .",
    "it eventually becomes unstable and reaches an imaginary frequency of about @xmath9 mev/@xmath10 at the maximum dilution .    in order to describe the evolution of the quadrupole mode during the expansion of the source",
    ", we consider the following model , in which the hamiltonian of the collective motion is taken as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the irrotational mass parameter associated with the collective variable @xmath13 determined by the sharp nuclear surface @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the number of nucleons in the source and @xmath16 represents the collective potential energy . for small deformation @xmath13 , the potential energy has a harmonic form @xmath17 with a time dependent spring constant @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 mev/@xmath10 denotes the frequency of the giant quadrupole vibrations at normal density . the time dependent factor @xmath21 in the spring constant describes the transition from stable to unstable regime during the expansion of the source .",
    "this factor is parameterized in accordance with the tdhf and rpa calculation : starting from @xmath22 it monotonicaly decreases in time and reaches a value around @xmath23 at a characteristic time @xmath24 for the source to reach the maximum instability ( typically , @xmath25 50 fm / c ) .",
    "the harmonic approximation is valid during early stages of the unstable evolution when the magnitude of fluctuations is small . in order to describe large fluctuations , we need to incorporate an anharmonic terms in the potential energy , @xmath26 , which prevent the fluctuation to grow indefinitely without bound . for symmetry considerations , we add an anharmonic term of the form @xmath27 in the potential energy to achieve the saturation of the fluctuations @xmath28 since , we are mainly concern with the early development of fluctuations , the precise form of this non - linear term is not important for this purpose . the numerical coefficient in front of the non - linear term is taken to be @xmath29 in order to obtain saturation of fluctuations at a reasonable value of the collective variable @xmath13 which corresponds to the quadrupole deformation of the fragmenting system ( e.g. the quadrupole deformation may lead to break - up of a system into two pieces ) .",
    "the numerical calculations presented are performed for a system containing @xmath30 nucleons .",
    "the classical langevin approach provides a useful framework for describing the dynamics of the collective motion including dissipation and fluctuations . in this approach ,",
    "the trajectory in the collective phase space , @xmath31 of an event @xmath32 , is determined by solving a langevin equation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the friction coefficient and @xmath35 is the random force arising from the coupling of the collective degrees of freedom with the single particle motion .",
    "the fluctuating force @xmath35 is assumed to be a white noise , and specified by a gaussian distribution with zero mean @xmath36 and a second moment @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the statistical average over the ensemble of events @xmath39 the diffusion coefficient @xmath40 is determined in terms of the friction coefficient by the classical dissipation - fluctuation relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the time - dependent temperature of the internal system which may be specified by assuming an isentropic expansion of the nuclear source .",
    "the only remaining parameter of the model is the friction coefficient , which may be estimated from the observed damping width of the giant quadrupole excitation according to @xmath43 . in the calculations , we take the damping width to be @xmath44 mev .    by generating a sufficiently large number of events , we can construct the phase - space density @xmath45 associated with the collective variables @xmath46 and @xmath13 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the number of events .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath49 of @xmath50 and the variances of the collective variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 are calculated as @xmath53 and @xmath54 the initial conditions of the events generated by the langevin equation is specified by the boltzmann distribution with the initial temperature @xmath55@xmath56 in our simulations , we sample the initial fluctuations using a metropolis algorithm@xcite .",
    "the classical description of the langevin equation provides a good approximation at sufficiently high temperatures at which the dynamics is dominated by thermal fluctuations . at low temperatures ,",
    "the langevin approach may be improved by incorporating the quantal fluctuations through the initial conditions and by specifying the diffusion coefficient through the quantal fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite . as a matter of fact , this description produces exact quantal phase - space density in the harmonic limit , for which the quantal fluctuation - dissipation relation may be expressed as @xmath57 for real @xmath6 . however ,",
    "in general for non - linear evolution , collective motion should be investigated in the basis of a quantal transport equation .      in quantal approaches",
    "the system is described by its density matrix @xmath58 on the collective hilbert space , @xmath59 which is determined by a quantal transport equation @xmath60 + i\\hbar \\hat{k}(\\hat{\\rho})\\ ] ] where @xmath61 represents a  collision term ",
    "arising from the coupling of the collective motion with the intrinsic variables , which corresponds to the friction and diffusion term in the langevin equation .",
    "the collective density matrix may be expanded in terms of a complete set of time - dependent wave functions @xmath62 as @xmath63 where the time - dependent wave functions are obtained by solving the time - dependent shrdinger equation @xmath64 and the elements of density matrix @xmath65 obey a master equation @xmath66 if the system initially is in statistical equilibrium at an initial temperature @xmath55 , it can be represented by a density matrix , @xmath67 it is convenient to introduce the eigenstates @xmath68 and the eigen - energies @xmath69 of the initial hamiltonian @xmath70@xmath71 as initial basis .",
    "consequently , the initial density matrix reduces to boltzmann occupation probabilities of the eigenstates of the initial hamiltonian , @xmath72    the probability density @xmath49 , and the variances @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the collective variables are calculated according to @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath75 since the model hamiltonian is nearly harmonic at the initial time @xmath76 , the initial variances of the collective variables can approximately be expressed in a closed form as @xmath77 here , the approximate expressions are valid when temperature is small as compared to the collectives frequency , @xmath78 , and hence the initial variances are dominated by the ground state zero point fluctuations . in the opposite limit",
    "when temperature is much larger than half the initial collective energy @xmath79 the initial variances of the collective variables can be approximated by @xmath80 which corresponds to the classical description discussed in the previous section .",
    "we carry out a number of simulations on the basis of two different approaches presented above to investigate the development of quadrupole shape instabilities in an expanding spherical nuclear system prepared at a range of initial temperatures and calculate the probability density @xmath49 and the variances @xmath51 , @xmath81 of the collective variables . in our calculations , we consider that the initial state is prepared at normal density and at a temperature in the range of @xmath2 mev .",
    "this is in accordance with the buu calculations for central heavy - ion collisions around fermi energy , which show that the collisions lead to an equilibrated composite spherical system at temperatures around @xmath82 mev .",
    "the second important parameter in our model is the characteristic time @xmath24 for expansion until the system reaches the turning point , which has a typical magnitude around @xmath83 fm / c . in order to see the influence of the expansion time on the dynamics of symmetry breaking",
    ", we present calculations for different @xmath24 .       at times",
    "@xmath84 fm / c for initial temperatures @xmath85 mev(left panel ) and @xmath86 mev ( right panel ) .",

    "is assumed to be constant and equal to the initial value .",
    "the width of distribution rapidly increase as the potential gets softer and the probability distribution splits into two components after the potential exhibits a local maximum at @xmath88 .",
    "figure 2 displays the variances associated with the collective variable @xmath13 and the collective momentum @xmath46 as a function of time for the initial temperatures @xmath89 mev and @xmath82 mev .",
    "the fluctuation in the collective coordinate rapidly increase until the system reaches the maximum instability and then saturates after 100 fm / c . during the same time the momentum distribution remains almost constant and goes to the asymptotic value given by the equipartition theorem @xmath90 . in figures 1 and 2",
    ", the dotted lines display the results of the pure potential calculations without the dissipation and fluctuations . during the expansion phase",
    "until the source reaches maximum dilution at about @xmath91 fm / c , the pure potential result for @xmath49 is very close to the langevin simulations with friction term and stochastic force .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations of the collective variable @xmath13 during the expansion phase are not developed dynamically but originate mainly from the propagation of the initial statistical fluctuations by the driving force . as the system expands , it cools down and consequently the magnitude of the stochastic force in the langevin equation become smaller .",
    "the dashed lines in figures 1 and 2 indicate the simulations carried out by employing a time dependent temperature , which is determined according to @xmath92 by assuming adiabatic expansion , where @xmath93 represents the root - mean - square radius of the expanding system . as seen from these , the cooling has a minor effect on the probability distribution @xmath49 during the early phase of the expansion .",
    "however , cooling has a sizable effect in momentum space at large times , as seen in the asymptotic value of the @xmath94 which also come close to the result obtained by the pure potential calculations .     and collective momentum @xmath46 as a function of time at initial temperatures @xmath85 mev(left panel ) and @xmath86 mev ( right panel ) .",

    "it is reasonable to expect a similar behavior in the quantal evolution of the collective motion .",
    "therefore in the application of the quantal model presented in section 2.3 , we neglect the collision term , and calculate the probability distribution @xmath49 and the variances @xmath51 , @xmath81 by keeping the occupation probabilities @xmath95 to be constant and equal to initial values specified by the bolztmann factors .",
    "solid lines in figure 3 illustrates the result of quantal calculations of the probability distribution @xmath49 at different times for two initial temperatures @xmath89 mev ( left panel ) and @xmath82 mev ( right panel ) . in the same figure , dotted lines show the classical simulations without friction and stochastic force , and also , as a reference dashed lines show the quantal calculations performed only with the ground state ( ie the @xmath96 mev case ) .     and collective momentum @xmath46 as a function of time at initial temperatures @xmath85 mev(left panel ) and @xmath86 mev ( right panel ) .",

    "the reduction of this time , depending on the temperature of the system , can be as large as factor of two .",

    "a finite nuclear system prepared at moderate temperatures around @xmath2 mev expands until the turning point which is located inside the unstable zone , and then continue to execute monopole vibrations .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the probability distribution of the collective coordinate @xmath13 and the collective momentum @xmath46 and determine the variances associated with these distributions as a function of time .",
    "our investigations indicate that during the expansion phase , the dissipation and fluctuation mechanism play an important role in the evolution of the momentum distribution , but the fluctuations in collective coordinate @xmath13 are developed mainly by enhancement of the initial fluctuations of statistical or quantal origin .",
    "furthermore , it appears that quantal fluctuations , which are already present at the initial state , play an important role in particular at low temperatures , in dynamics of symmetry breaking by reducing the time required for reaching the critical fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the spinodal decomposition and the resultant fragmentation may take place in a faster time scale than predicted by semi - classical simulations @xcite . therefore , it is off great interest to develop stochastic simulation methods for heavy - ion collisions by incorporating quantal fluctuations associated with collective motion in a suitable manner .",
