    "the lattice discretization of fermions introduces some well known difficulties ; demanding strict locality and absence of doublers leads to breaking of chiral symmetry . in order to recover this symmetry in the continuum limit one must set the renormalized fermion mass ( @xmath5 ) equal to zero . to achieve this",

    "are the results for @xmath94 along with the value of @xmath96 corresponding to each one of the 16 actions used in this calculation .",
    "an attractive feature of this improvement procedure is that it can be applied also to higher loop perturbative results , with due care to avoid double counting of the cactus diagrams which were already included at one loop .",
    "ideally , of course , one loop improvement should already be adequate enough , so as to obviate the need to consider higher loops ; indeed , we find this to be the case and , consequently , we limit our discussion of two - loop improvement to only the plaquette action @xmath97 , the iwasaki action @xmath98 and the dbw2 action @xmath99 . using these values ,",

    "finally , in table [ tab14 ] , we present a comparison of dressed and undressed results , for some commonly used values of @xmath104 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and we also compare with available non perturbative estimates for @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "to recapitulate , in this paper we have calculated the critical mass @xmath7 , and the associated critical hopping parameter @xmath0 , up to two loops in perturbation theory , using the clover action for fermions and the symanzik improved gluon action with 4- and 6-link loops .",
    "the perturbative value of @xmath7 is a necessary ingredient in the higher - loop renormalization of operators , in mass independent schemes : such renormalizations are typically defined and calculated at vanishing renormalized mass , which amounts to setting the lagrangian mass equal to @xmath7 .    in our calculations ,",

    "the propagator appearing in feynman diagrams is the inverse of a nondiagonal matrix ; while this inverse can be written down explicitly , it is more convenient , and more efficient in terms of cpu time , to perform the inversion numerically .",
    "integrations over loop momenta were performed as momentum sums on lattices of finite size @xmath105 , where typically @xmath106 ; extrapolation to @xmath107 introduces a systematic error , which we estimate quite accurately .",
    "our results for @xmath7 are significantly closer to zero in the case of symanzik improved actions , as compared to the plaquette action . in particular",
    ", the dbw2 action stands out among the rest , in that @xmath7 vanishes exactly for a value of @xmath1 around 1 .",
    "thus , improved actions seem to bring us quite near the point of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 on the number of flavors is seen to be very mild .",
    "this fact would also suggest that , in the case of nondegenerate flavors , @xmath7 should depend only weakly on the mass of the virtual fermion .",
    "finally , we have made some comparisons among perturbative and non - perturbative results for @xmath0 .",
    "while these are expected to differ for a power divergent additive renormalization , such as the quantity under study , we nevertheless find a reasonable agreement .",
    "this agreement is further enhanced upon using an improved perturbative scheme , which entails resumming , to all orders in the coupling constant , a dominant subclass of tadpole diagrams .",
    "the method , originally proposed for the plaquette action ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , was extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to encompass all possible gluon actions made of closed wilson loops , and can be applied at any given order in perturbation theory . as would be desirable , one - loop improvement is seen to be already adequate to give a reasonable agreement among perturbative and non - perturbative values . indeed ,",
