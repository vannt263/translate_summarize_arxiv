    "among the peculiarities of granular systems  @xcite , there are jamming processes consisting in a sudden transition from a flowing to a solid state @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if submitted to an anisotropic stress , a granular material can jam after a transient flow .",
    "this transition is observed neither at low densities , where granular materials behave like fluids , nor at very high densities , where they behave as disordered solids .",
    "the jammed solids obtained under these conditions , are so unconventional that it has been claimed to represent an absolutely new state of matter , which have been termed ` fragile matter '  @xcite .",
    "fragility is based on the idea that during the flow particles rearrange until they find a configuration able to balance the external stress .",
    "it is speculated that the force chains sustaining this configuration are strictly related to the flow - generating stress , so that they can support incremental stress oriented as the former ( compatible stress ) . by contrast , the may not sustain a stress applied in a different direction ( incompatible stress ) , which may allow the system to restart flowing .",
    "this resembles the case of a pile of sands obtained in the presence gravity .",
    "the pile responds as a solids to stress directed as the weight , but it falls down under the action , for example , of a shear stress .",
    "a more precise statement of the idea of fragility has been provided in the limit of hard spheres @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , a system jammed in the presence of a constant shear stress @xmath0 : in this framework compatible stress variations , @xmath1 with @xmath2 , lead to an elastic response .",
    "conversely incompatible stresses , such as @xmath3 restore flow , also for infinitesimal values of @xmath4 . in this sense , these systems are ` fragile ' and strongly differ from any ordinary visco - elastic or elasto - plastic material .",
    "previous results suggest that , in the presence of a shear stress , a fragile behavior can only be observed in frictional granular systems @xcite . indeed , as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , flowing frictionless systems have never been observed to spontaneously select a microscopic state able to sustain the applied stress , while , conversely , in the presence of friction a much more complex phenomenology has been found  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in recent works  @xcite reporting molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of soft frictional grains at constant volume and applied shear stress , it was observed the phenomenology who inspired the idea of fragile matter  @xcite . indeed , for some values of the control parameters , the system was found to select a configuration able to sustain the applied stress after a small slip , or even after very large strains at constant rate  @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "whether the mechanical response of the system is peculiar or rather similar to that of other amorphous and soft materials  @xcite is still an open question . in particular",
    "it is not clear to what extent fragility can capture the physics of these systems . in more concrete terms , can small incompatible stresses restore the flow ?    in this paper , we investigate via md simulations the mechanical response of frictional granular systems jammed in the presence of a shear stress .",
