    "we numerically demonstrate that the ipt method exactly captures the atomic limit of the lattice model .",
    "the fact that a perturbative calculation captures the atomic limit ( ie , @xmath50 ) is not to be expected , but , interestingly enough , is analogous to the well known property of the ipt solution of the one band hubbard model .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : ipt_dimer_exact ] where we compare the exact self - energy of the atomic limit ( isolated dimer ) with the respective ipt solution .",
    "the most stringent test for the comparison is done within the coexistence region , since there the structure of the green s functions and self - energies are very non - trivial .",

    "[ fig : electronic_structures ] we show the electronic dispersion ( ie , @xmath51 and @xmath38 resolved density of states @xmath54 ) of the metallic and insulating states obtained by the ipt , ct - qmc and ed methods , respectively . as seen in the figure , all the three methods provide the key qualitative features that are discussed in the text .",

    "there are in fact also two additional intra - dimer hopping amplitudes ( associated to e@xmath61 states ) , which are 0.22ev and a smaller value .",
    "the values for the hopping amplitudes found in later works @xcite are consistent with this findings .",
    "since we are considering a unit cell with two sites and one orbital each , we have a single intra - dimer hopping parameter .",
    "therefore , and in the spirit of a mean field theory , we chose a value that is the approximate average of the 3 hopping amplitudes .    in regard to the value of @xmath11 , we adopted the value of @xmath62 for the semi - quantitative comparison with experiments .",

    "the two sites are related by symmetry thus the two bands are degenerate in the atomic - site representation but are distinct in the bonding / antibonding basis .",
    "the physics of the system is independent of the choice of the representation . to further clarify this point we show in figure [ fig : ipt_ab_spectra_character ] the dos from our model calculation from fig .",

    "<S> @xcite , bearing directly on the issue of the driving force behind the transition . </S>",
    "<S> they systematically investigated the @xmath43 as a function of @xmath3 using nano - imaging spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> they clearly identified within the @xmath3 range of the mit the electronic coexistence of insulator and metallic regions , characteristic of a 1st order transition . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial observation was that upon warming the insulator in the m1 phase , metallic puddles emerge with a @xmath43 that was significantly different from the signal of the normal metallic r phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the data provided a strong indication of a purely electronic driven transition . </S>",
    "<S> regarding this point we would like to mention also the works of arcangeletti et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and laverock et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that reported the observation of metallic states within the monoclinic phase under pressure and strain , respectively . coming back to the experiment of qazilbash et al . </S>",
    "<S> , a key point that we want to emphasize here is that @xmath43 in the putative m1-metallic state was characterized by a intriguing mid - infra - red ( mir ) peak @xmath44 1800 @xmath45 ev , whose origin was not understood . from our results on the electronic structure within the coexistence region , </S>",
    "<S> we find a natural interpretation for the puzzling mir peak : it corresponds to excitations between the split metallic quasiparticle bands . </S>",
    "<S> since they are parallel , they would produce a significant contribution to @xmath43 , which enabled its detection . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - ac ] we show the calculated optical conductivity response ( see sup . mat . </S>",
    "<S> section 7 ) that corresponds to the spectra of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - arpes ] . in the metal </S>",
    "<S> we see that , in fact , a prominent mir peak is present at @xmath46 0.22 ev , in excellent agreement with the experimental value . on the other hand , the optical conductivity of the insulator shows a maximum at @xmath47 ev in both , theory and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also note the good agreement of the relative spectral strengths of the main features in the two phases .     of metal and insulator within the coexistence region for parameters </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14=0.3 , @xmath11=2.5 and @xmath3=0.01 . </S>",

    "<S> .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in conclusion , we showed that the detailed solution of the dimer model treated within dmft can account for a number of experimental features observed in vo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal model has an impurity problem which is analogue to that of lda+dmft methods , yet the simplicity of this approach allowed for a detailed solution that permitted a transparent understanding of many physical aspects of the electronic first order transition in this problem . </S>",
    "<S> it exposes a dimer - mott - transition mechanism , where the effective intra - dimer exchange is controlled by correlations , it is weakened in the metal and strongly enhanced in the mott insulator . in the metal </S>",
    "<S> , this leads to a pair of split quasiparticle bands , which then in the insulator further separate , to join and coexist with the usual incoherent hubbard bands . despite the simplicity of our model </S>",
    "<S> , we made semi - quantitative connections to several experimental data in vo@xmath0 , including a crucial optical conductivity study within the 1st order transition , that remained unaccounted for . </S>",
    "<S> our work , sheds light on the long - standing question of the driving force behind the metal - insulator transition of vo@xmath0 highlighting the relevance of the mott mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the present approach may be considered the counterpart for vo@xmath0 , of the dmft studies of the mott transition in paramagnetic cr - doped v@xmath0o@xmath1 .    </S>",
