    "it is found that the protons prefer to fill the @xmath39 orbital rather than @xmath24 and @xmath25 orbitals ( @xmath13 configuration ) in the case of heavier isotones .",
    "the negative parity states are due to odd number of protons in @xmath39 orbital . *",
    "the transition probabilities are in a good agreement with the experimental data and they are useful for understanding the structure of these isotones . * the neutron excitations across @xmath0 gap is important for the intermediate - high - spin states in case of @xmath1xe , @xmath2cs , and @xmath3ba isotones .",
