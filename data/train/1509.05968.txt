    "the simple harmonic oscillator is studied in every course in elementary quantum mechanics because of its relative mathematical simplicity and its usefulness as a model of natural processes : oscillators are ubiquitous in nature and harmonic traps are used in many labs . yet little attention",
    "is given to the time - evolution of oscillator wave functions , beyond the fact that the evolution is periodic .",
    "many texts do derive the propagator , but using it requires an integration that can be carried out exactly only for a small class of wave functions.@xcite    here we will consider some of the simple methods that can be used to understand the general features of how oscillator wave functions evolve .",
    "we start with the simple relations between the evolved and the initial wave functions after each multiple of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the period of the equivalent classical oscillator .",
    "then the evolution of some moments of the wave functions will be determined .",
    "the first moments , that is the expectation values of position and momentum , give ehrenfest s result that @xmath4 and @xmath5 follow a classical trajectory .",
    "a powerful result is that the evolution of oscillator wave functions is essentially independent of the first moments .",
    "consequently we need consider only states that remain centered on the origin ( taken to be the point where the oscillator restoring force is zero ) .",
    "all other states can be reduced to these by a simple transformation .",
    "the second moments give a rich set of results about uncertainties and energy .",
    "squeezed states emerge as gaussian states at the extreme edge of a strong form of the uncertainty relations , an inequality involving the second moments .",
    "all gaussian states can be produced by changing the spatial scale of ( that is squeezing ) the ground state , and applying the transformations discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "similarly , any state can be produced , apart from a phase , by changing the scale of its ` stable ' form whose second moments remain constant as it evolves .",
    "the evolution of any state can be obtained from that of its stable form .",

    "the oscillator has a symmetry between position and momentum ( essentially because each appears only as a quadratic term in the hamiltonian ) and this is somewhat obscured when using the usual physical quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "almost every equation in this paper would be simpler , and the general arguments clearer , if expressed in the dimensionless variables .",

    "a simpler result applies over half a period : @xmath255 . applying this result",
    "twice gives @xmath29 .",
    "thus the true period of the quantum oscillator is twice that of the classical oscillator ; evolution over @xmath256 returns the wave function exactly to its original .",
    "these results imply that , for any initial wave function , the evolution over any time interval can be found from that through the first half period .",
    "if the initial wave function is real , only the first quarter period is needed .",
    "the simplest fact about the continuous evolution is ehrenfest s result that the centroid strictly follows classical evolution ; that is , sinusoidal oscillation that can be easily calculated from the initial values .",
    "the evolution of the whole wave function relative to the centroid , is essentially independent of that of the centroid , and therefore we need consider only states that remain centered on the origin ( the center of force of the oscillator ) ; that is , states with @xmath257 .",
    "any other wave function can be evolved by first applying a simple transformation that depends only on @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this greatly simplifies the practical problem of evolution of an oscillator .    without calculating the full evolution ,",
    "a great deal about the behaviour of wave functions can be obtained from the three second moments @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath118 , which form a closed set : given their initial values we can find their evolution , independent of any other properties of the wave function .",
    "the energy can be separated into the energy @xmath146 of the centroid ( the energy of the equivalent classical oscillator ) which depends only on the first moments , and the quantal energy @xmath145 , which is the remaining part of @xmath258 .",
    "the quantal energy can be expressed in terms of second moments , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "both @xmath146 and @xmath145 remain constant .",
    "the evolution is also constrained by the constancy of the combination @xmath261 .",
    "this constant @xmath148 is subject to the inequality @xmath149 , which contains ( but is stronger than ) the traditional heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "the extreme case of @xmath170 implies that the wave function is gaussian , and is known as a squeezed state .",
    "apart from the motion of the centroid and the choice of the origin of the time , squeezed states are characterized by a single parameter that defines the extent of the oscillations of the second moments .",
    "the case with no such oscillations is the _ coherent _ state , equivalent to the ground state of the oscillator",
    ".    for some states , here called stable states , the second moments do not change with time .",
    "if we have the evolution of a stable state @xmath49 , then the evolution of any state @xmath262 can easily be written down .",
    "also , from any state @xmath49 one can find a stable state through a transformation that involves only its second moments , and the evolution of @xmath49 can be easily found from that of its stable state . thus the evolution of every oscillator wave function ( for which the second moments exist ) is simply related to that of a stable state at rest at the origin .",
    "the main focus here has been the basic principles ; but the potential applications are spread widely in physics , because harmonic oscillations are ubiquitous . in practice , there will be other physical processes acting ( such as radiation and environmental effects ) .",
    "these can be dealt with using a basis of energy eigenfunctions of the oscillator , but in some cases it is more effective to shift and scale the basis to match the changes in the object being studied .",
    "the evolution of such displaced and squeezed eigenstates was discussed in sections ( [ sec : indy ] ) and ( [ sec : scale ] ) .    in two or three dimensions",
    "all the results above can be applied in each dimension since the oscillator hamiltonian can be separated as a sum of commuting terms .",
    "thus , for example , in the case of an isotropic oscillator in three dimensions , the centroid of every state will travel along an elliptic orbit in a plane and the evolution of the wave function can be reduced to that of a state that remains centered on the origin .",
    "the propagator @xmath48 , as defined by eq .",

    "( [ eqn : da ] ) , then@xcite @xmath40 will satisfy schrdinger s equation @xmath275 apart from a possible time - dependent factor , and will give the @xmath10-dependence of the propagator .    in the case of the oscillator",

    "( [ eqn : prop ] ) .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : prop ] , the phase given here is valid only for @xmath291 because of the singularity when @xmath292 .    * resolving the ambiguity in phase*. this analysis shows that a representation of the @xmath293-function is @xmath294 so that , for small @xmath9 , @xmath263 . for @xmath295 , eq .

    "this extra phase is required each time @xmath9 passes through a multiple of @xmath301 .",

    "( [ eqn : propa ] ) requires an extra factor of @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the integer part of @xmath304 .",
    "this phase change can be better understood through maslov theory and phase space geometry.@xcite",
    "the standard lowering operator for the oscillator is @xmath305 and the ground state @xmath240 has @xmath306 with the wave function @xmath307 . from this ground state , we can generate the infinite sequence of excited eigenstates by repeatedly applying the raising operator @xmath308 .",
    "thus @xmath309 , where @xmath25 is some real number that could be taken to preserve normalisation , but is not relevant here .",
    "we will now find a relation between @xmath310 and its fourier transform ( or the momentum wave function ) .",
    "this relation arises from the symmetry between position and momentum in the oscillator , and it helps to use dimensionless variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 to make this symmetry more explicit .",

    "we show that changing the scale of a state can not yield a stable state unless @xmath165 ; but after a suitable phase change , a stable form can always be reached .",

    "many textbook examples have initial wave functions that are real , and therefore have special properties .",
    "these properties are ephemeral because every real wave function will immediately become complex ( due to the term @xmath358 in schrdinger s equation ) .",
