    "l . lions and r. diperna showed in @xcite the existence and the uniqueness of the almost everywhere defined flow solution to an ordinary differential equation of the type : @xmath3 for @xmath4 vector fields @xmath5 with @xmath6 divergence ( along with some technical assumptions ) . for such singular vector fields ,",
    "the only possibility is to solve the equation _ almost everywhere _ on the space @xmath7 of initial conditions . in that case",
    ", one defines a flow @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 for almost all @xmath10 .",
    "an initial time @xmath11 may of course be chosen , and the flow then depends parametrically on this initial time  @xmath12 . with a view to simplifying the presentation , we will assume henceforth and throughout this article that the field @xmath5 is time - independent .",
    "our arguments may be modified to cover the time - dependent case .    in the present article ,",
    "we also adopt a notion of _ almost everywhere flow solution _ similar to that of diperna and lions .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the pushforward of the lebesgue measure @xmath14 . in the sequel , the vector - field @xmath5",

    "@xmath28 satisfies the ordinary differential equation in the sense of distribution_. their definition is equivalent to ours .",
    "it is indeed shown in @xcite that the original definition implies @xmath27 , and it can be shown that conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 together imply that @xmath31 .",
    "condition @xmath29 is in particular satisfied if @xmath5 is sufficiently smooth , and @xmath32 . in that case @xmath33",
    "is convenient . besides this case",
    ", for a class of ordinary differential equations coming from some particular types of hyperbolic equations , such as the keyfitz - krantzer system , @xmath34 is only @xmath2 , but an estimate of the form @xmath29 may be established using a maximum principle .",
    "see the work @xcite by bressan for more details on these systems and that by l.  ambrosio , f.  bouchut and c.  de  lellis @xcite for a discussion on the relevance of condition  @xmath29 .",
    "we now give a brief state - of - the - art survey on the theory of ordinary differential equations with vector fields of low regularity .",
    "the seminal work @xcite by diperna and lions has been complemented and extended notably by l. ambrosio in  @xcite .",
    "several other authors have made important contributions .",
    "we would like to specifically cite the work  @xcite by n. lerner which has inspired our own , present work .",
    "to date , the minimal conditions that are known to guarantee the existence and the uniqueness of the flow are the @xmath0 regularity of the vector field , a @xmath2 bound on the divergence together with a near - incompressibility condition ( or more classically a condition of bounded divergence ) of the type @xmath29 . the classical proofs of such results are based upon the consideration of the associated transport equation , written either in the conservative form @xmath35 or in the non - conservative form @xmath36 both with the initial condition @xmath37 .",
    "remark that , for divergence - free fields , the two equations coincide .",
    "when the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to the transport equation is established , for any given initial condition , one deduces the same result for the a.e .",
    "flow solution to the ordinary differential equation .",
    "the key ingredient for the resolution of the transport equation is a commutation lemma ( first stated in @xcite ) , which states that @xmath38 c. de lellis and g. crippa have recently given in @xcite a new proof of the existence and uniqueness of the flow solution of , not using the the associated transport equation .",
    "their very interesting approach provides regularity estimates for @xmath39 vector - fields with @xmath40 but seemingly fails for @xmath4 vector - fields , unfortunately .",
    "very recently , the approach has been succesfully improved by p .- e .  jabin . in @xcite",
    ", this author extends the direct method by c. de lellis and g. crippa to the case of bounded sbv vector fields ( with locally finite jump set for the @xmath41 hausdorff measure ) in any dimension , and also to two - dimensional @xmath0 vector - fields that satisfy a particular , local assumption in the direction of the flow .",
    "in addition , in @xcite , the same author , in collaboration with n.  champagnat , has proved that , in the particular case of an ode corresponding to the newton equation of motion ( that is , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , there exists a flow solution if @xmath44 , and this flow is unique among the class of flows obtained by regularization of the problem .    before we get to the heart of the matter , some comments are in order regarding our assumptions , which are slightly different from those of  @xcite .",
    "the important assumption in @xcite is the bound from above for @xmath45 in ( ii ) , in order to prevent _ contraction _ of the measure .",
    "in addition , the group structure ( our assumption ( iii ) ) is not required in  @xcite . in the present state of our understanding ,",
    "such differences seem to us related to the different techniques of proof used in  @xcite and here .",
    "the need for ( iii ) is consistent with our previous work  @xcite where , in order for the proof of uniqueness to be performed , the group structure is necessary in the lagrangian viewpoint , but not in the eulerian viewpoint .",
    "the assumption on the group structure is also present in @xcite . in the present contribution",
    ", we need this assumption because we transform integrals back and forth in time ( see our argument in section 2 below ) . to end this discussion",
    ", we also note that assumption  ( ii ) may be slightly weakened if we are only interested by the uniqueness of the forward - in - time flow . in that case , we may replace ( ii ) by @xmath46 \\,.\\ ] ] this is in contrast to the assumptions of  @xcite , which uses a bound from above : @xmath47 .",
    "this owes to the very strategy of our proof , which mostly uses the backward - in - time flow .",
    "for instance , the most important step is performed on the backward flow . in any event , owing to the group property , the upper and lower bounds are closely related to one another .",
    "the two uniform bounds in @xmath29 are indeed necessary to conclude when the issue considered is the uniqueness of both the backward - in - time and the forward - in - time flows .",
    "we refer the reader to remark  [ rk : final ] at the end of the proof for more details .",
    "the purpose of this article is to give a new and direct proof of the uniqueness of the a.e .",
    "flow solution to   for @xmath0 vector fields , _ without _ arguing on the associated transport equation .",
    "we adopt the approach already used in @xcite for @xmath4 vector fields .",
    "basically , the commutation lemma instrumental in the proof contained in this prior publication is replaced by another strategy of proof , namely the introduction of a second variable .",
    "this is explained in details in the next paragraph .",
    "our result is the following :    [ thm:1 ] let @xmath5 be a @xmath0 vector field on the @xmath48-dimensional torus @xmath49 . if @xmath50 , then there exists at most one a.e .",
    "flow solution to  , in the sense of definition  [ def : aeflow ] .",
    "in @xcite , b. perthame and i. capuzzo dolcetta remarked that the assumption `` @xmath51 '' of the original work by diperna and lions could be replaced by the weaker assumption `` the symmetric part of @xmath52 is a matrix - valued @xmath2 function '' .",
    "this observation seems to not be valid for the present strategy of proof , and more generally in the @xmath0 case .",
    "the reason is , their argument is based on the use of radially symmetric regularization kernels , while the regularization kernels we use here for the bv case are typically anisotropic .",
    "theorem  [ thm:1 ] states uniqueness of the flow . we do not know which condition , besides the general assumptions of theorem  [ thm:1 ] , makes possible the proof of existence of a flow in the sense of definition  [ def : aeflow ] , using the approach developed here for uniqueness .",
    "to start with , we outline here the proof performed in details in the next section .",
    "as already said , the proof uses a technique introduced in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "a smooth convolution kernel @xmath53 , with normalized integral , is considered .",
    "it is then proved that for any two a.e .",
    "flows @xmath25 and @xmath54 solutions to the ordinary differential equation with @xmath4 coefficients , @xmath55 now , the limit of the integral is @xmath56 this shows that , for all @xmath20 , @xmath57 since this quantity vanishes at initial time .",
    "the uniqueness of the solution follows .",
    "remark that the introduction of the extra - variable @xmath58 allows to perform the calculation without using the transport equation .",
    "our aim is to now modify the above approach and treat bv vector fields . for this purpose",
    ", we use a convolution kernel well adapted to the geometry of the flow and the possible singularities of the bv vector field under consideration . in short ,",
    "we consider the regularization kernel @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is a smooth function , @xmath61 is a constant that will be sent to infinity , and @xmath62 is an approximation of the direction normal to the jumps of the measure @xmath52 .",
    "the purpose of such a construction is to have a regularization that decreases faster in the direction normal to the jumps .",
    "the idea of a direction - dependent regularization was first introduced by p.l .",
    "lions in @xcite .",
    "n. lerner introduced the specific position - dependent regularization used here in @xcite with a view to simplifying the proof of uniqueness originally given by l.  ambrosio for the @xmath0 case .",
    "his argument , however , is still based upon the equivalence with the transport equation . in the present paper",
    ", we combine his argument with the approach consisting in introducing a second variable , already employed in @xcite for @xmath4 vector fields .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 ( resp .",
    "@xmath64 ) the @xmath1 density of the measure @xmath65 ( resp .",
    "@xmath66 ) with respect to @xmath14 .    consider now the kernel @xmath67 where @xmath53 is a smooth , compactly supported , function , from @xmath68 to @xmath69 which we will make precise below .",
    "assume in addition @xmath53 satisfies @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",
    "our aim is to estimate @xmath72 where @xmath25 and @xmath54 are two flow solutions to  . in the sense of distributions , @xmath73 this",
    "is established using the lebesgue continuity of the functions @xmath54 and @xmath74 at almost every point , along with the @xmath1 bound on @xmath75 .",
    "remark that the lebesgue continuity may be used if the support of @xmath76 is not exceedingly stretched in one direction ( more specifically , we should have some constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 , see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the kernel we shall use satisfies such a condition for all @xmath79 , even though in the limit of a vanishing @xmath80 , it is infinitely stretched . our purpose is to show that the limit is @xmath81 this will eventually prove the uniqueness of the flow solution to using the bounds from below on @xmath75 and @xmath74 inferred from @xmath29 . to this end , we first perform the change of variable @xmath82 in @xmath83 , and then differentiate under the integral @xmath84 which we write @xmath85 , with @xmath86 with the notations @xmath87 and @xmath88 . then , we return to the original variables @xmath89 @xmath90 and next use the change of variable @xmath91 @xmath92 we now need to estimate these two terms when @xmath93 goes to zero .",
    "we begin with the easiest of the two , namely  @xmath94 .      because @xmath53 is smooth , @xmath95 , and almost all points are lesbesgue points for the two functions @xmath54 and @xmath74 , we can use the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem and obtain @xmath96 now @xmath97 since @xmath98 , for all @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath99        we now wish to pass to the limit @xmath101 in . if @xmath5 were @xmath4 , the limit could easily be identified .",
    "it would suffice to replace @xmath102 by @xmath103 in , and next use the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem .",
    "all this does not require making specific the convolution kernel @xmath53 ( see below and @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the presence of the singular part of @xmath52 , we have to argue more carefully .",
    "\\(i ) the radon - nikodym decomposition of its derivative @xmath52 writes @xmath104 where the superscript @xmath105 stand for `` absolute continuous part '' , and @xmath12 stand for `` singular '' respectively . as @xmath106 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure ,",
    "we write it @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a @xmath2 matrix - valued fonction .",
    "\\(ii ) in addition , the polar decomposition of the singular part @xmath109 of the measure @xmath52 writes @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the total variation of the matrix - valued measure @xmath112 , and @xmath113 a matrix - valued fonction , such that @xmath114 , @xmath111-a.e ( the norm used for @xmath113 is the norm induced on matrices by the euclidian norm of @xmath115 ) .",
    "to prove our claim , we regularize @xmath25 , @xmath54 , @xmath75 and @xmath74 , using some smooth @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "next , we replace @xmath123 by @xmath124 ( an equality true for almost all @xmath125 ) and perform the change of variable @xmath126 ( we use it even for the measure @xmath52 because this is a linear change of variable ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath127 let us decompose @xmath128 in two parts , according to the above proposition  [ prop : radon ] , @xmath129 where @xmath130 where we have used that @xmath131 ( as we work on the torus ) . and letting @xmath93 going to zero , we obtain ( [ eq : variante ] ) for @xmath119 , @xmath120 and the @xmath132 . then ( [ eq : variante ] ) is obtained letting @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 approximate @xmath25 , @xmath54 , @xmath75 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the majoration  ( [ eq : variante ] ) being established , we proceed as follows .",
    "arguing as above for @xmath135 , that is using the smoothness of @xmath53 and the fact that almost every point is a lebesgue point for @xmath54 , @xmath75 and @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath136 with @xmath137 . to calculate this term ,",
    "we integrate by parts and use the property @xmath138 @xmath139 so we have obtained @xmath140 the next step consists in proving that the right - hand side of ( [ eq : variante ] ) may be chosen arbitrarily small .        * [ alberti s rank one theorem , ( * ? ? ?",

    "then , @xmath113 is of rank one @xmath111-almost everywhere , that is , there exists two vector - valued functions @xmath144 and @xmath145 , both @xmath111-measurables , such that @xmath144 and @xmath145 are unit vectors @xmath111-a.e . and",

    ", we now make specific our convolution kernel @xmath53 .",
    "we choose @xmath153 where @xmath60 is a smooth , compactly supported , non negative function such that + , and @xmath154 is a smooth , matrix - valued function , such that @xmath155 is an orientation preserving matrix for all @xmath71 .",
    "note that owing to the presence of the determinant , the integral of @xmath76 remains equals to one independently of @xmath71 .",
    "the dilation matrix @xmath155 is set to @xmath156 ( with the notation @xmath157 for the endomorphism @xmath158 ) , where @xmath62 is a smooth vector - valued function . on the jump of the measure @xmath52 , @xmath62",
    "will be chosen later as an approximation of the direction normal to the jump set . the factor @xmath61",
    "will be chosen as large as possible .",
    "it may possibly depend upon @xmath71 and be large only on a neighbourhood of the singular set of the measure @xmath52 , but we for simplicity of the calculation we will not use that not essential possibility here .",
    "we use this in the bound on @xmath151 to obtain @xmath160 where here and below @xmath161 denotes various irrelevant constants . to simplify this term",
    ", we perform the change of variable @xmath162 , and obtain @xmath163    we next intend to use the special form @xmath164 , to bound from above the two scalar products .",
    "let us first formally illustrate our argument , performing our calculation with @xmath165 , as if @xmath145 were smooth . in this case , latexmath:[\\[| \\langle z , u(x ) \\xi_b(x ) \\rangle | = |\\langle z , \\xi_b(x ) \\rangle",
    "| \\leq      inserting these bounds in , we obtain @xmath169 where the constant @xmath170 depends only of @xmath60 and @xmath5 .",
    "it remains then to let @xmath61 to infinity to obtain @xmath171 and conclude our ( formal ) proof .",
    "we now modify the above formal argument using an approximation @xmath62 of @xmath145 , instead of @xmath145 itself .",
    "first , we remark @xmath172 where we have used @xmath173 , @xmath111-a.e ( from corollary  [ divsing ] ) , and that @xmath144 , @xmath145 are unit vectors .",
    "to bound the scalar product @xmath174 , we decompose @xmath175 in @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the projection of @xmath175 on @xmath178 @xmath179        we finally show that @xmath183 to this end , we first choose @xmath61 such that @xmath184 is small , and then construct a smooth function @xmath62 , sufficiently close to @xmath145 on the support of @xmath112 so that @xmath185 is also small ( use for that classical approximation theorem with respect to the radon measure @xmath112 ) .",
    "note that @xmath62 can be arbitrarily extended to the whole torus as its value outside the support of @xmath112 is irrelevant .",
    "this concludes the proof of the convergence of the right - hand side of ( [ eq : variante ] ) to zero .",
    "* step 4 : conclusion * collecting all the previous results , we obtain @xmath186 where we have replaced @xmath187 by @xmath34 , since we are dealing with vector fields @xmath5 having at least , divergence in @xmath2 . if @xmath32 , then @xmath188 since the integral in the right hand side vanishes initially , we conclude that @xmath189 and finally that @xmath190 a.e . in @xmath71",
    "since the @xmath191 are bounded away from @xmath192 . note that , as usual , if only the solution at positive times if of interest , an assumption on the negative part @xmath193 of the divergence suffices to conclude .",
    "when only the weaker hypothesis  @xmath194 holds , we have to slightly adapt the above argument .",
    "we choose a smooth compactly supported function @xmath195 , insert a factor @xmath196 in the integral defining @xmath197 .",
    "we now estimate @xmath198 the above argument carries over to the present case .",
    "an equality similar to is obtained @xmath199 which can also be written ( using the change of variable @xmath200 ) @xmath201 we next define @xmath202 .",
    "equation holding for all @xmath203 , it follows that @xmath204 in the distributional sense .",
    "there is no derivative of @xmath205 with respect to @xmath71 in the equation , so that the variable @xmath71 is only a parameter .",
    "since @xmath50 and condition ( ii ) holds , we have @xmath206 for all time @xmath207 .",
    "so that , for almost all @xmath71 , @xmath208 .",
    "therefore equation ( [ eq : no - deriv ] ) is well - posed for almost all @xmath71 , and since by construction its solution @xmath205 vanishes at initial time , it vanishes for all time : @xmath209 for all @xmath20 , a.e . in @xmath71 .",
    "this concludes the proof : @xmath210 .",
    "[ rk : final ] given the above argument , the reader may now understand that , when the uniqueness of only the flow for positive times is under study , the upper bound @xmath211 , for times @xmath45 in ( ii ) of definition  [ def : aeflow ] may be somehow relaxed . in that case , and as briefly announced in the introduction , we may only assume that @xmath212 \\,.\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath213 means here _ absolutely continuous with respect to_. the group property allows to equivalently state ( composing the previous inequality with @xmath214 ) that @xmath215 \\,.\\ ] ] in that case , we have @xmath216 and also @xmath217 almost everywhere in @xmath71 since , considering @xmath218 for all mesurable set @xmath219 .",

    "as pointed out by l. ambrosio in @xcite , the use of the alberti rank one theorem can be circumvented . in our proof , it is possible to use the following , much simpler ingredient . for any matrix @xmath221 , we have @xmath222 where the infimum is taken over all smooth kernels with total mass one . essentially applying this result to the matrices @xmath223 we manipulate in the proof , and using @xmath224",
    ", we may obtain an estimate analogous to , thus .",
    "we then conclude our argument similarly .",
