    "perturbative quantum field theory ( qft ) has been very successful in describing three of the four known forces of nature .",
    "it has been used to construct the standard model of particle physics , which has been tested to a great accuracy in accelerator experiments .",
    "however when the same methods of qft are applied to the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) theory of gravity , well known problem emerge , namely the theory is plagued with uv divergences . at each order of perturbation theory",
    "one has to add new counter terms to cancel the existing divergences , as a result the theory loses predictability .",
    "this is due to the fact that in 3 + 1 dimensions the newton s constant has the mass dimension @xmath0 .",
    "classically eh theory is very successful in describing cosmology @xcite .",
    "it was shown that when one studies quantum matter fields on curved background @xcite , four kind of divergences appear : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "this was a first hint that perhaps if when one augments the eh theory with @xmath5-th order metric derivative terms , one might witness uv renormalizabilty .",
    "indeed it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath5-th order metric derivative gravity is uv renormalizable using @xmath6 dimensional regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "the most general action that includes all terms up to @xmath5-th order metric derivative terms is given by , @xmath7 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the ricci scalar and @xmath9 is the ricci tensor .",
    "the last term is proportional to the square of weyl tensor in 3 + 1 dimensions up to an euler characteristic . here",
    "@xmath10 is dimensionless and @xmath11 has dimensions of mass .",
    "doing perturbations around the flat background @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) one obtains the propagator of the theory @xcite . here",
    "we will consider the action @xmath14 for @xmath15 in the landau gauge @xmath16 , where the feynman propagator of theory in momentum space is given by , @xmath17 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the momentum of fluctuating field @xmath19 .",
    "various spin projectors are @xmath20   - \\frac{1}{3 } t_{\\mu\\nu}t_{\\alpha\\beta } $ ] , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : grav_prop1 ] ) is the massless spin-2 graviton with two degrees of freedom , the second term is the scalar ( riccion ) of mass @xmath23 and the last term is that of massive spin-2 with mass @xmath11 ( @xmath11-mode ) .",
    "the last term arises due to the presence of @xmath24 term in the action .",
    "if we only had @xmath25 type of theory , this term will be absent . from the propagator eq .",
    "( [ eq : grav_prop1 ] ) we note that the residues at the pole for graviton and riccion are positive , while for the @xmath11-mode it is negative .",
    "the @xmath11-mode renders the theory non - unitary .",
    "we now study the issue of unitarity of higher derivative gravity action given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdgact ] ) .",
    "the full @xmath26-matrix of theory involve gravitons , riccions and @xmath11-mode as the external legs .",
    "lets consider a subpart of this @xmath26-matrix which involve only riccion and graviton as external legs , which means that we are considering scattering process which involve only riccion and graviton but no @xmath11-mode as external leg . in this subpart of @xmath26-matrix",
    "we ask whether this under some conditions remains unitary ? in any such scattering process , @xmath11-mode can appear as an intermediate state , which is not present in our subpart of @xmath26-matrix .",
    "for intermediate energies @xmath27 less than @xmath11 it can not occur anyway . in renormalized quantum field theory these mass parameter are also energy dependent .",
    "hence if @xmath28 is always greater than @xmath27 then it can not occur at any intermediate energy , consequently the subpart of @xmath26-matrix can also satisfy unitarity . in this scenario the physical amplitudes do get contributions from the @xmath11-mode but not from the imaginary part of @xmath11-mode _ i.e. _ cutkosky cut corresponding @xmath11-mode vanish identically .",
    "thus in the renormalized theory if @xmath29 is satisfied , then we can have unitary theory of only gravitons and riccions @xcite . in the following",
    "we will see how this can be realized .",
    "we choose to parameterize our gravity action as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdgact ] ) , so that in the path - integral @xmath30 effectively plays the same role as @xmath31 ( in the absence of matter fields ) _ i.e. _ the loop expansion is same as perturbation theory in small @xmath30 . to one - loop beta function of couplings have been computed using the schwinger - dewitt technique @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this was done using dimensional regularization in @xmath6 space - time dimensions . in the landau",
    "gauge the beta function are the following @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and all @xmath34 contains the leading contribution in @xmath30 ( @xmath35 is also taken to be small ) , with higher powers coming from higher loops being neglected .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : betam2 g ] and [ eq : beta_wm2 g ] ) we solve for the running of @xmath10 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . on studying eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta_w ] ) we find that the rg flow of @xmath10 has two fixed point : @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with former being repulsive and later attractive under the uv evolution or increasing @xmath41 .",
    "we realize that both these fixed points lie in the unphysical domain . the last equality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta_w ] ) tells that @xmath34 is always positive for @xmath42 .",
    "this means that @xmath10 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath41 and vice - versa .",
    "( [ eq : betam2 g ] ) is easily integrated to express the flow of @xmath43 in terms of @xmath41 .",
    "this is then plugged in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta_w ] ) to obtain , @xmath44 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with subscript @xmath47 meaning that the coupling parameters are evaluated at @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "as @xmath10 takes value between zero and infinity , this translates using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tw ] ) in to a range for @xmath41 .",
    "we note that @xmath41 takes a minimum value for @xmath50 while a maximum value for @xmath51 . @xmath52 using the evolution equation for @xmath10 , one can transform any evolution of coupling in @xmath41 space to @xmath10 space .",
    "this allows analytical expressions for the flow of other couplings . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : betag ] and [ eq : beta_w ] ) we get , @xmath53 where the first equation expresses the running of @xmath54 in @xmath10 space , while in second equation we write its solution .",
    "the first equation tells that during the rg evolution @xmath30 gets extremised at @xmath55 , taking the second derivative it is shown that this point is a maxima .",
    "we choose this point to be our reference point @xmath56 or @xmath48 and integrate to obtain the second equation , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "( [ eq : betalogg ] ) show that for large @xmath10 or @xmath41 , @xmath59 , thereby vanishing for large @xmath41 @xcite , while for small @xmath10 , @xmath60 reaching a peak at @xmath61 . similarly , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : beta_wm2 g ] and [ eq : betag ] ) we obtain the running of @xmath62 , which along with with eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta_w ] ) is integrated to give @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this tells that as @xmath66 , the mass of the @xmath11-mode also goes to infinity , which means that ultimately it is decoupled from the theory .",
    "but does it goes to infinity quick enough so that it is never encountered in the theory , is the question we ask next ? to answer this we now analyze @xmath67 .",
    "it is instructive to note that from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : betam2 g ] , [ eq : betag ] and [ eq : beta_w ] ) we obtain the running of @xmath68 , @xmath69 this shows that @xmath67 reaches a minima for @xmath70 given by @xmath71 .",
    "hence by demanding @xmath72 , we make the @xmath11-mode not realizable in the physical gr sector of the theory .",
    "this inequality is easily achievable by choosing @xmath73 appropriately .",
    "perturbative loop expansion requires that @xmath43 is small .",
    "therefore @xmath11 is a sub - planckian mass , yet the running mass as dictated by interactions makes it physically not realizable even in post planckian regime .    one can do a similar analysis to answer the question whether riccion is realizable or not ?",
    "for this we study the rg evolution of @xmath74 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : beta_wm2 g ] , [ eq : betag ] and [ eq : beta_w ] ) we obtain @xmath75 , showing that the riccion mass relative to @xmath27 decreases monotonically . by a suitable choice",
    "we can make the riccion to be physically realizable or not .",
    "so we conclude that there exists unitary physical subspace only with the gravitons or along with riccions .    to make the running of @xmath76 to zero we add two spin-@xmath77 dirac fields ( for detail see @xcite ) with mass @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite ( these additional fermionic fields can be interpreted as ghosts normalizing the functional integral ) .",
    "this assures that if initially @xmath15 , then throughout the rg flow @xmath76 will remain zero .",
    "the affect of adding the two dirac fields is just to shift @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , but all conclusions remains unaltered .    in arbitrary gauge the beta function @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 remains unaltered , which means that running of @xmath10 and two fixed points @xmath81 and @xmath82 remains same .",
    "however the beta function of @xmath86 gets modified . in a general gauge",
    "it is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 depend on the gauge - fixing parameters used , while the leading term is gauge invariant .",
    "this means that @xmath80 shifts .",
    "doing the same analysis as before , we write the running of @xmath30 in terms of @xmath10 , from which we note that for large @xmath10 or @xmath41 , @xmath59 is a gauge invariant result , while for small @xmath10 , the rate at which @xmath30 vanishes depend on @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "by doing the one - loop analysis we have found that there is no solution for @xmath10 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tw ] ) if @xmath90 .",
    "this is because @xmath10 reaches its maximum value infinity . in the other extreme",
    "when @xmath50 , @xmath41 reaches its minimum value @xmath91 . for @xmath92 , @xmath10",
    "become negative _ i.e. _ @xmath62 the riccion mass square becomes negative signaling the instability of the vacuum .",
    "finally we conclude that the action @xmath14 , eq . ( [ eq : hdgact ] ) describes a perturbative quantum gravity as self consistent , renormalizable and unitary theory of gravitons and the curvature can not become singular , in particular it can not fluctuate wildly at sub - planckian @xcite or post planckian regimes consistent with known cosmology .",
    "its predictions asymptotically beyond planck scale needs to be investigated further .",
