    "hawkins , maddox and merrifield ( 2002 ) claimed that an analysis of the large 2df quasar sample showed no evidence for quasar redshift periodicity .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is not to address their criticism of past evidence ( that has been done by napier and burbidge , 2003 , who show the past evidence is indeed valid ) - but rather to show that , also contrary to the hawkins et al .",
    "claim , a simple qualitative analysis of the new data plus a detailed analysis of a few sample fields , reveals that quasar periodicity is indeed strongly present .",
    "the model which is used here to predict properties of quasars in the survey regions is radically different from the canonical view .",
    "it has evolved from observational evidence over the past thirty eight years and has two main properties which can be expressed as :    * quasars originate from within , and are ejected by , active galaxies .",
    "thus , in a real sense , active galaxies are parents to quasars ; + the evidence for this arose originally from radio quasars paired across disturbed galaxies .",
    "it was acccepted that galaxies ejected radio sources in roughly opposite directions .",
    "ejection therefore appeared a natural explanation for these pairs of radio quasars ( arp 1967 ) .",
    "later x - ray jets were often found in the cores of radio jets and they were in turn associated with the more numerous x - ray quasars in pairs and lines - many of which were found to be aligned with the nuclei of low redshift galaxies .",
    "+ some of the papers generally showing evidence involving radio emitting qsos and bright galaxies , x - ray - emitting qsos and active galaxies , and pairs with optical , radio and x - ray connections are ( burbidge et al .",
    "1971 ; pietsch et al . 1994 ; burbidge 1995 , 1997 , 1999 ; radecke 1997 ; arp 1967 , 1996 , 1997,1999 , 2003 ; arp et al .",
    "1990 , 2002 ) .",
    "two of the most impressive recent examples are the x - ray qsos connected to the nucleus of ngc 3628 ( arp et al .",
    "2002 ) and the discovery of two qsos in the optical bridge between ngc 7603 and its companion galaxy ( lpez - corredoira and gutirrez 2002 ) .",
    "+ the observed physical association with low redshift galaxies is explained by the ejection hypothesis but it also enables an empirical test of the periodic nature of the quasar redshifts because ; * quasars are always higher redshift than the ejecting galaxy and none show negative redshifts of approaching velocities .",
    "the conclusion is that they must have intrinsic redshifts which are much larger than their ejection velocities .",
    "supporting the interpretation of the redshifts as intrinsic it was then found that the redshifts had discrete preferred values in the frame of their parent galaxy .",
    "( the karlsson periodicity",
    "formula).the ejection velocities allowable are small compared to these intrinsic redshifts .",
    "they are observed to spread the redshifts around the preferred values by less than about + /-",
    "0.1 in z. from their preferred values .",
    "nevertheless that deviation from the periodic value can be used to test the prediction that the velocities are generally + and - in pairs , representing the approaching and receding velocities which would be necessary in order to conserve momentum in an ejection process .",
    "we test that prediction in the present paper by analyzing some cases in which several pairs of quasars surround a central , ejecting galaxy .    three specific consequences",
    "follow :    * firstly , since quasars are ( by hypothesis ) associated with _ specific _ active galaxies , then any redshift periodicity will only become apparent when the quasar s redshift is corrected into the rest - frame of the parent galaxy .",
    "* secondly , the putative parent galaxies will be generally much brighter than their quasar off - spring ; * thirdly , quasars of bright apparent magnitude will generally be nearby so that their associated parent galaxies _ will tend _ to be low - redshift objects .",
    "quasars of faint apparent magnitude will generally be more distant so that their associated parent galaxies _ will tend _ to be higher - redshift objects .",
    "this implies that , _ generally speaking _ , the redshifts of quasars with bright apparent magnitude will require little or no correction for the periodicity effects to be manifested , whilst quasars with faint apparent magnitude will require considerable correction .",
    "we begin by reviewing the history of redshift periodicity claims , and then consider the recent counter - claim by hawkins , maddox and merrifield ( 2002 ) that , based on a large - scale analysis of the 2df field , quasar redshift periodicity is not present . for this",
    "we first consider the overall 2df data , pointing out that periodicity is apparent in the bulk data and then go on to consider , in detail , four sample fields of 2df and sdss .",
    "we conclude that the basic hypothesis is very much strengthened by the new large - scale surveys .",
    "the existence of a preferred redshift of @xmath0 for bright quasars was first pointed out by burbidge and burbidge ( 1967 ) .",
    "further periodicities were found by lake and roeder ( 1972 ) and burbidge and odell ( 1972 ) .",
    "karlsson ( 1971 , 1973 , 1977 ) showed that the formula @xmath1 provides a good fit to the major observed peaks at @xmath2    karlsson established his fit with a sample of 574 quasars to a 99.9% confidence level .",
    "later barnothy and barnothy ( 1976 ) confirmed this periodicity to the 99.99% confidence level .",
    "depaquit et al .",
    "( 1985 ) showed how every test to that date supported the karlsson formula . with a larger sample of quasars",
    "fang et al .",
    "( 1987 ) again confirmed these results .",
    "a few years later it was shown that the periodicity was particularly prominent for quasars which were close ( by angular measure ) to low redshift galaxies ( karlsson 1990 ; arp et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "it had also become clear by then that those low redshift galaxies with which such quasars appeared to be preferentially associated , tended to be morphologically disturbed and/or to have spectroscopically active nuclei .",
    "for example , the pairing of x - ray quasars across x - ray active seyert galaxies demonstrated physical association at the 7.5 sigma level ( radecke 1997 ; arp 1997 ) .",
    "evidence continued to accumulate , culminating in the discovery of two active seyfert galaxies , @xmath3 ( chu et al .",
    "1999 ) and @xmath4 ( arp 1999 ) which had a total of eleven quasars accurately aligned along their minor axes .",
    "ten of these clearly associated quasars fell close to the karlsson peaks ( see arp 1998 , p. 244",
    ", 284 -285 ) .",
    "most recently burbidge and napier ( 2001 ) have tested the periodicity yet again with three different samples of quasars and found the fit to be significant at the @xmath5 level .    the earlier studies , such as those discussed above , used largely bright quasars ( and therefore nearby , according to the hypothesis ) so that the associated ( putative parent ) galaxies had negligible redshifts .",
    "it follows that , for these samples , the periodicities ( if they exist ) would show up in the _ uncorrected _ redshifts .",
    "it is important to recognize that as early as 1990 it was understood that quasar redshift periodicity appeared to decline as quasar apparent brightness declined .",
    "this result became clear in the process of addressing the question of color selection effects in catalogued quasars .",
    "two different samples of quasars were tested by arp , bi , chu and zhu ( 1990 ) . in the first sample , multiple quasars falling significantly closer than chance to low redshift galaxies were analyzed .",
    "the discovery criterion for these quasars was blue @xmath6 colours which were shown to be insensitive to redshift values .",
    "the significance of the peaks ranged from 94% to 99.5% for a sample size of 54 to 49 quasars .",
    "it was found , however , that the redshifts showed better correspondence to the karlsson peaks when corrected for the red shift of the associated galaxy .",
    "the effect was small , however , because the redshifts of the associated galaxies were also relatively small .",
    "the redshift transformation formula is the canonical one @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the observed quasar redshift and @xmath9 is the observed redshift of the associated galaxy which , by our hypothesis , is the ejecting galaxy .",
    "the second sample analysed consisted of all radio quasars brighter than 1 jansky at 11 cm .",
    "it turned out in the end that this sample gave a fit to the karlsson formula at a level of 99.997% .",
    "of course , for quasars chosen on the basis of their strong radio emission there could be no question of color selection .",
    "but one thing was clearly stated in the arp et al . 1990 paper and that was the redshifts _ `` . . .",
    "become less clearly periodic as the radio strength declines . .",
    "_ also , it was stated that : _",
    "`` likewise the periodicity becomes less well marked fainter than v @xmath10 18 mag . .",
    ". '' _    with both the radio and optical apparent brightness diminishing it was reasonable to suppose that the quasars were becoming more distant",
    ". the parent galaxies with which they were associated would then be more distant and their redshifts would become non - negligible .",
    "the fainter quasars would need appreciable corrections to bring them into the rest frames of their parent galaxies .",
    "we would then expect any plot of quasar redshifts against apparent magnitude to show the periodicity better at bright magnitudes than at faint magnitudes .",
    "as we shall show , this is _ exactly _ what we find with the 2df quasars .",
    "after all this , a sample of 1647 quasars close , by angular measure , to galaxies of otherwise arbitrary properties in the 2df survey field of 289.6 sq .",
    "deg . was announced as showing no periodicity `` at the predicted frequency . . . or at any other frequency.''(hawkins , maddox and merrifield 2002 ) .",
    "we note that the sole criterion employed by hawkins et al to identify a parent galaxy was simply projected closeness on the sky of the galaxy to the quasars tested - thus , apart from the fact that , for the host of faint galaxies , there are very many more purely chance associations than for bright galaxies , critical criteria concerning the relative brightness and the state of activity of the chosen galaxies were not considered .",
    "in fact present investigations show the most significant associations of faint survey quasars is , for example , with um strong emission line galaxies(univ .",
    "michigan objective prism survey ) .",
    "these parent galaxies are are in a brightness range around 15 to 18 mag . - not in the brightnes range of the 2df galaxies in which hawkins et al .",
    "were attempting to test correlations .",
    "we show that quasar density plots in the apparent magnitude / redshift plane reveals the periodicity structure crudely but plainly , and in a way that requires no sophisticated statistical analysis to appreciate .",
    "in essence , we proceeded as follows : the 2df survey was conducted in two distinct declination strips : the declination strip @xmath12 centered at about @xmath13 contained in the first release 4200 + quasars .",
    "the declination strip @xmath14 centered at about @xmath15 contained 6700 + quasars .    for each declination strip",
    ", the whole region was divided into boxes @xmath16 in the redshift / apparent magnitude plane , and the number of quasars per box counted .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show density contours plotted through the fields . since we are using the _ raw _ redshift data then , according to the basic hypothesis , at any given concentration level we should then expect to see contour spikes _ for the brighter objects _ near the karlsson peaks @xmath17 whilst , for dimmer objects we should expect to see no signal at all .",
    "these expectations are met , as we describe below .",
    "the declination strip @xmath12 is plotted in figure [ fig1 ] , and the outermost contour represents a density of 20 quasars per box whilst the innermost contour represents a density of 50 quasars per box . in this region ( in the direction of the local super cluster )",
    "we see strong bright - end spikes near @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these are labelled @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the declination strip @xmath22 is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] , and the outermost contour represents a density of 27 quasars per box whilst the innermost contour represents a density of 65 quasars per box . in this region",
    "we see again strong bright - end spikes near @xmath23 .",
    "the situation near @xmath24 is less clear .",
    "these are also labelled @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the really striking feature , of course , is the consistency of positioning between the @xmath25 bright - end spikes in both figures - it is this feature which makes it clear that these spikes are not functions of random variation in the data , but represent a real phenomenon .",
    "together , they provide a strong , if noisy , confirmation of the reality of the karlsson peak in quasar redshift data in the large sample presented in the first release of the 2df .",
    "after completion of this paper the final release of the 2df fields took place ( colless et al 2003 ) .",
    "it was thought interesting to see the foregoing analysis applied to the final data set .",
    "this is supplied here in fig .",
    "3 where all 22,435 qso s , in both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 strips together , are contoured in density steps of 102 , 135 , 165 , 195 and 225 .",
    "again we see the peaks b , c and d roughly confirming the early release results .",
    "it is clear , however , that in different regions different bright spikes are encountered and that with averaging over many regions they tend to become less distinct .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "3 there is a new prominent spike at a little greater than z = 2.1 labeled e. this can be identified with the quasars from a large region near the south galactic pole which is dominated by the sculptor group of galaxies . between roughly @xmath28 and @xmath29 , objective prism surveys in strips across this region showed concentrations of @xmath30 quasars .",
    "( osmer and smith 1980 ; arp 1983 ; 1984 ) .",
    "the current 2df strip across this region confirms this previously discussed concentration of quasars .    however , it is also clear from these contour plots that even selecting a bright subsample that was sufficiently large to include all four bright - end spikes ( typically , @xmath31 ) _ would not _ produce a sample that was sufficiently clean that a simple technique like power spectrum analysis would detect the periodicity signal implied by the @xmath32 spikes .",
    "for example inclusion of somewhat fainter , uncorrected quasars moved the predicted peaks in figs . 1 and 2 toward z = .65 , 1.02 , 1.48 and 2.05 , ( as predicted by the results of arp et al .",
    "1990 , especially fig . 3a and 3b of that paper ) . for",
    "much fainter apparent magnitude quasars the parent galaxies would have a much wider range in redshift and the raw quasar redshifts would be expected to approach a smooth distribution as is , in fact , born out by the contours at faintest apparent magnitudes in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "it would seem that , for the basic hypothesis to be comprehensively demonstrated , it is necessary to attempt the association of quasars with their respective parent galaxies , so that the quasar redshifts can be transformed into the appropriate rest frames .",
    "for this purpose , there would seem to be no substitute for actually looking at the fields which are being tested to see what kinds of galaxies there are in those fields , and how the quasars are actually distributed with respect to those galaxies .",
    "in the following , we use a single field from the @xmath33 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) to make the point that , whereas a naive analysis would find no evidence of periodicity , a more critical analysis which paid full attention to the basic hypothesis would find it to be very strongly confirmed _ on this single field_.    the field to be considered , which is in the vicinity of the active ( @xmath34 ) markarian galaxy @xmath35 , was chosen for two reasons :    * firstly , prior to the @xmath33 , there were known to be karlsson - peak quasars at @xmath36 and @xmath37 only @xmath38 and @xmath39 away ( arp 1981 ; 1987 ) . * secondly , in the intervening years , the @xmath33 survey has identified further quasars in the general vicinity of @xmath40 which have not been previously examined .    however , the problem is complicated by the fact that the general field which contains all these newly catalogued quasars also contains another bright ( @xmath41 ) active galaxy - the seyfert @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) - which is also a putative parent galaxy for any quasars in the vicinity .",
    "what we shall show is that _ all _ of the catalogued quasars within approximately 35 arcmins of either of these two bright objects is a karlsson peak object relative to one or the other of them .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists all catalogued quasars within 33 of @xmath44 - with the exception of two objects which we associate with @xmath42 .",
    "table 2 lists all catalogued quasars which lie within 36 of @xmath42 .",
    "4 shows a @xmath45 radius field centered on @xmath42 , with all the @xmath33 objects included .",
    "note : fig .",
    "4 does not show all the @xmath44 objects , but does include two karlsson - peak quasars ( bottom @xmath46 ) not listed in either table .",
    "these two are omitted because , although they are karlsson peak objects in the frame of @xmath44 ( or in the frame of either of the other two @xmath34 objects in the field ) , they lie outside the chosen @xmath47 radius circle associated with @xmath44 .",
    ".quasars associated with @xmath48 [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     _ _",
    "@xmath49 = + .03 to + .05  @xmath49 = .00    @xmath50 = .049  @xmath50 = .023    we can then see which set of transformed redshifts fits the periodicity peaks best .",
    "the answer is given at the bottom of the 4th and 6th columns .",
    "it shows that the relative velocities measured by @xmath51 for the companion case are all positive .",
    "( except for u4 which sits just on the edge between two karlsson peaks ) . on the other hand the plus and minus values exactly balance for the z = 0.305 case .",
    "this means the average ejection velocities in the approaching and receding directions average to zero as they should if they are associated with this qso .",
    "( the same argument holds if the residuals are not velocities but represent intrinsic scatter around a peak . ) also the absolute size of the residuals needed to correct the redshifts on to the intrinsic peaks are only half as large than when it is assumed that the z = 0.006 galaxy is the progenitor .    in order to further illustrate the significance of the periodicity present in the redshifts of the group of qsos south of ngc 2639",
    ", we now plot the residuals from those redshifts in the rest frame of a range of possible parent galaxies . _",
    "13 shows that the deviations from the karlsson periodicities reach a very sharp minimum exactly at z = .305 , the redshift of the actual agn / qso that we have assigned as the parent of this group . _        it is also apparent that there is a secondary minimum for a parent at z = 0.062 , not quite as good as the z = 0.305 but very similar and exactly one karlsson period away from z = 0.305",
    ". early studies of low redshift qsos and agn suggested that the first intrinsic redshift peak lies at z = 0.061 ( burbidge 1968 ) . in a later sample arp et al .",
    "( 1990 ) obtained z = 0.062 .",
    "a similar situation suggesting secondary ejection might also be true for the northern qso with z = 0.323 which is paired with the z = 0.305 qso across ngc 2639 .",
    "however , to test this it would first be necessary to search for qsos around this object , and so far this has not been done .    here",
    "we must gratefully acknowledge the remeasuring of six of the quasars in the ngc 2639s group which resulted in correction of two of the original 10 redshifts ( ford , h. et al .",
    "these corrections helped make the fit of the quasars to the periodicity , and their association with the parent , so precise in the present paper ,    in all , this analytical procedure raises interesting opportunities to study the mathematical behavior of the karlssson periodicities as manifested by parents of different redshifts . taking a group of quasars of apparently unrelated redshifts , making the required transformation to the redshift of the candidate parent galaxy and then finding the redshifts to fit a previously well defined formula , would seem to confirm at a very high level of probability the periodicity relation as well as demonstrating again the physical association of specific low redshift galaxies with high redshift quasars .",
    "in the fields around ngc 622 and um 341 we note that on the @xmath52 axis the karlsson period is @xmath53 , so that the expected deviation from a peak - value is about @xmath54 .",
    "the mean actual deviations of the @xmath55 s is @xmath56 , and a very conservative calculation of the odds of all fourteen of the _ new _ quasars being a karlsson peak quasar relative to either one of @xmath44 or @xmath42 gives a probability of @xmath57 of it being a chance occurrence .    in more detail , we ask the following question : given the existence of the two bright active independent objects , @xmath44 and @xmath42 in the field of figure fig",
    ". 4 and the two existing karlsson peak quasars ( arp 1981 , 1987 ) adjacent to @xmath44 , what is the probability of fourteen out of fourteen new quasars turning out to be karlsson peak objects for _ either one _ of @xmath44 or @xmath42 ?    we proceed as follows : the expected dispersion of measured redshifts from the nearest karlsson peak along the @xmath52 axis , given that there is no effect , is @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , the actual mean dispersion is @xmath56 , and the odds of any one quasar falling that close to a karlsson peak after being transformed into the frame of , say @xmath44 , is about @xmath58 - given that there is no effect .",
    "but , the quasar might be a karlsson peak object for _ either _ of @xmath44 or @xmath42 , and since we allow ourselves this possibility , it must be accounted for .",
    "the probability of this dual eventuality is easily calculated to be about @xmath59 .",
    "since we have fourteen such quasars , the overall probability is now estimated as @xmath60 .",
    "this calculation is highly simplified of course , but it is to be noted that no account is taken of the pairing configuration of figure [ fig4 ] - even though such configurations are to be expected in terms of the basic hypothesis and not to be expected if the quasars are unassociated .",
    "thus the true probabilities of finding what is observed are very much smaller than we actually calculate .",
    "as for the results shown in figs . 6 and 7 , one approach would be to reason that if the redshifts were not related to the specific periodicity peaks one would expect equal probability of the points in fig . 7 falling anywhere in the interval p = 0 to 1 with a mean at p = .5 .",
    "- i.e. a horizontal line . the histogram shows , however , an excess of 14 points with p = .28 and less.the chance of this can be roughly calculated as @xmath61 .",
    "alternatively we could estimate the probability of the configuration arising by chance , by noting that of the 27 quasars in the field , 17 of them actually fall within the @xmath62 circle around the karlsson peaks and 10 fall outside .",
    "simple binomial statistics then gives the probability of this configuration arising by chance , as @xmath63 .",

    "<S> we test the periodicity of quasar redshifts in the 2df and sdss surveys . in the overall surveys redshift peaks are already apparent in the brighter quasars . but by analyzing sample areas in detail it is shown that the redshifts fit very exactly the long standing karlssson formula and confirm the existence of preferred values in the distribution of quasar redshifts .    we introduce a powerful new test for groups of quasars of differing redshifts which not only demonstrates the periodicity of the redshifts , but also their physical association with a parent galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> further such analyses of the large area surveys should produce more information on the properties of the periodicity .    </S>",
