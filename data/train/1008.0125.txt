    "the probability of a configuration is given by the _ gibbs distribution _",
    "@xmath8 here @xmath9 is a positive parameter and @xmath10 is a normalizing factor ( the  partition function \" ) .",
    "thus a configuration @xmath11 of the sos model may be pictured as an interface or contour with fixed endpoints @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "notice that the gibbs distribution favors contours that are `` smooth '' ( i.e. , have no large jumps in height ) , this bias being more pronounced for larger values of  @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the contour can be thought of as the path of an @xmath5-step random walk with independent geometric increments , conditioned to be positive and smaller than @xmath5 and to return to the origin at time  @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , its typical maximum height will be of order @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the ( discrete time ) _ glauber dynamics _ for the sos model .",
    "this is a natural local markov chain on configurations whose transitions update the height at a randomly chosen position  @xmath15 from  @xmath16 to @xmath17 ; the transition probabilities are chosen so that the dynamics is reversible w.r.t .",
    "the gibbs distribution  @xmath18 and thus converges to it from any initial configuration .",
    "our goal is to determine the _ mixing time _ ,",
    "i.e. , the number of steps until the law of dynamics is close to its equilibrium distribution  @xmath18 in variation distance .",
    "although markovian dynamics for the sos and related models have been studied extensively in many contexts connected with the behavior of random surfaces ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , to the best of our knowledge the mixing time has not been rigorously analyzed .",
    "there are at least three motivations for studying this question , which we now describe .",
    "the first motivation comes from the tight connection with the more familiar ( two dimensional ) ising model , whose glauber dynamics has been the focus of much attention in both statistical physics and computer science ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the ising model in an @xmath2 box @xmath19 , the configurations are assignments  @xmath20 of spin values @xmath21 to the vertices of  @xmath22 .",
    "the gibbs distribution is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of neighbors in  @xmath22 whose spins differ and @xmath9 is inverse temperature .",
    "the ( heat - bath ) glauber dynamics runs as follows : at each time step a random vertex @xmath25 is chosen and its current spin value is replaced by a new value sampled from the equilibrium distribution at @xmath15 given the neighboring spins .",
    "a variety of techniques have been introduced in order to analyze , at increasing levels of sophistication , the typical time scales of the relaxation process to the reversible gibbs measure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these techniques have proved to be quite successful in the so - called  one - phase \" region , corresponding to the case when the system has a unique gibbs state .",
    "when instead the thermodynamic parameters of the system correspond to a point in the  phase coexistence \" region , a whole class of new dynamical phenomena appear ( such as coarsening , phase nucleation , and motion of interfaces between different phases ) whose mathematical analysis at a microscopic level is still far from complete .",
    "one of the most important and fundamental open problems is that of proving a polynomial ( in  @xmath5 ) upper bound on the mixing time at low temperatures ( large  @xmath9 ) , when the boundary conditions around the edges of  @xmath22 are fixed to be  @xmath26 and hence force the system into the @xmath26  phase is replaced by a regular tree or hyperbolic graph , then optimal @xmath27 bounds on the mixing time  @xcite or on the spectral gap  @xcite have been established . ] .",
    "( we remark that even the proof of a _ lower bound _ , usually a much simpler task , requires all the heavy technology of the wullf construction and the associated large deviation theory  @xcite . )",
    "the above question is easily reduced to the following problem : if the box is initially filled with @xmath28 spins , how long does it take until this large region of  @xmath28 is destroyed under the influence of the @xmath26 boundary conditions and replaced by an equilibrium configuration ? this in turn is equivalent to the question of how the outer contour of the @xmath28 region contracts towards the center of the box .",
    "for large  @xmath9 , it is conjectured  @xcite that the contour evolves according to a mean curvature motion and therefore should disappear in polynomial time  @xmath29 ( independent of  @xmath9 ) , apart from possible logarithmic corrections . ] ; however , until very recently only very weak upper bounds of the form @xmath30 were known  @xcite ( except in the qualitatively different zero temperature case , which is analyzed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the sos model has been proposed  @xcite as an idealized model of this ising contour , in which we think of the sites above and below the sos contour as being  @xmath26 and  @xmath28 respectively .",
    "( note that the sum @xmath31 in the gibbs distribution  ( [ eq : gibbs ] ) is , up to an additive constant , exactly @xmath24 under this interpretation . )",
    "the mixing time is essentially the number of steps until the maximal contour ( i.e. , with @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) drops down close to the bottom of the box under the influence of the boundary conditions of height  0 .",
    "the main simplification here is that , unlike the ising model , the sos contour has no  overhangs \" ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "however , for large  @xmath9 one may hope that overhangs are rare , so the approximation should give useful insight into the behavior of the true ising contour ( see  @xcite for much more on this point ) .",
    "one of our principal motivations in this paper is to introduce techniques that may find application to the ising model .",
    "indeed , this has already occurred , as the very recent paper  @xcite builds on some of the ideas and techniques of the present paper to obtain an upper bound of @xmath34 ( for arbitrary @xmath35 ) on the mixing time of the ising model at low temperatures with @xmath26 boundaries , a substantial improvement on the @xmath30 bound mentioned earlier though still quite far from polynomial .",
    "the second motivation comes from general polymer models  @xcite , and their natural glauber - type evolutions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in these models",
    "the `` polymer '' is just the @xmath5-step path of some type of random walk , starting and ending at zero and constrained to stay non - negative .",
    "the associated gibbs distribution is simply that induced by the probability distribution of the random walk .",
    "an additional interaction , or _ pinning _ , between the polymer and the line or `` wall '' at height zero can also be included , and the nature of this interaction ( attractive , repulsive or even random ) plays a crucial role .",
    "the glauber dynamics can be defined in analogous fashion to the one studied in this paper . when the increments of the random walk are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath36 random variables ( with or without a bias ) , the mixing time of the associated glauber chain has been analyzed quite precisely in various cases using the so called `` wilson method ''  @xcite .",
    "when instead the increments are no longer uniformly bounded , as is the case for the sos interface in this paper , a rigorous analysis of the associated glauber dynamics apparently becomes much more challenging .",
    "this brings us to our third motivation , which stems from the challenge that the sos model poses to standard techniques .",
    "the two most natural approaches to estimating the mixing time seem to be the following :    1 .",
    "_ coupling .",
    "_ one might hope that , under the natural monotone coupling of the sos model ( see section  [ sec : prelims ] ) , the expected hamming distance between two coupled copies of the dynamics is non - increasing .",
    "this would lead to a mixing time bound of @xmath37 , hides factors of @xmath38 . ] which as we shall see is rather weak and also gives little insight into the evolution of the contour .",
    "in fact even this is not always true ( the distance may increase in expectation in some cases ) , and a direct approach based on monotone coupling remains elusive .    2 .  _",
    "_ another standard approach is to first analyze a ",
    "non - local \" dynamics in which transitions are allowed to update the height  @xmath16 to any value in @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "typically , non - local dynamics are easier to analyze precisely ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one can then use the machinery of diaconis and saloff - coste  @xcite to relate the mixing time of the local dynamics to that of the non - local one , as was done , for example , by randall and tetali  @xcite for the related  lozenge tilings \" model .",
    "however , since such comparisons proceed via the spectral gap , they are usually quite wasteful ; in particular , for the sos model this approach leads to a mixing time of @xmath40 .    in this paper",
    "we aim for a more refined analysis that gives , in addition to an almost tight bound , greater insight into the actual evolution of the contour in the sos model .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ thm : main ] for the @xmath2 sos model at any inverse temperature @xmath41 , the mixing time is @xmath0 .",
    "the bound on mixing time is tight up to a factor of  @xmath14 ( and logarithmic factors ) , as a lower bound of @xmath42 follows from straightforward arguments ( see theorem  [ thm : lower ] below ) .",
    "the high level strategy of our analysis is as follows :    \\(a ) we first prove ( see section  [ from n to equilibrium ] ) that in @xmath43 steps the maximal configuration ( i.e. , the one in which the contour has height @xmath5 everywhere ) reaches equilibrium .",
    "this analysis in turn is split into @xmath44 repetitions of a basic _ key result _ which says that , starting in equilibrium but conditioned to be above height @xmath1 , in time  @xmath45 the system reaches equilibrium ( see theorem [ root(n ) mix ] ) .",
    "this result allows us to bring the original contour at height  @xmath5 down to equilibrium in a sequence of @xmath44 stages , each of which runs in @xmath46 steps and decreases the height by  @xmath14 .",
    "\\(b ) we then ( see section  [ from zero to equilibrium ] ) analyze the time to reach equilibrium when the initial configuration is the minimal one ( where the height is  0 everywhere ) , and show that @xmath45 steps suffice .",
    "the results of  ( a ) and  ( b ) immediately imply , by standard results on monotone coupling , that the mixing time is @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis in the key intermediate result of part  ( a ) , and also in part  ( b ) , rests on the following four essential ingredients :    ( i )  first , we give a tight analysis of the non - local dynamics mentioned above , showing that its mixing time is @xmath47 ( see theorem  [ thm : col ] ) .",
    "this analysis , which we believe to be of independent interest , follows an idea of wilson , developed in the context of the lozenge tilings model  @xcite , in using an eigenvector of the discrete laplacian to obtain a contraction in distance .",
    "however , to get this approach to work in our setting we need to bound a certain  entropy repulsion \" effect due to the height barriers at  0 and  @xmath5 ( see lemma  [ lem : newht ] ) .",
    "( ii )  we then relate the local to the non - local dynamics using a recent  censoring inequality \" of peres and winkler  @xcite , which says that _ censoring _ ( i.e. , not applying ) some subset of updates in a monotone dynamics can only increase the distance from stationarity .",
    "this allows one to simulate a single move of the non - local dynamics , at position  @xmath15 , by censoring all local moves except those that update  @xmath16 ; by the censoring inequality , this can only increase the mixing time . as a result ,",
    "the mixing time of the local dynamics is bounded above by that of the non - local dynamics times a factor related to the mixing time of the one - dimensional local process within the @xmath15th  column \" .",
    "essentially , censoring allows us to  schedule \" the updates and thus maintain detailed control of the shape of the contour .",
    "( iii )  a nave application of the censoring inequality would entail a substantial overhead of @xmath48 due to the mixing time within a column , which is essentially the square of the maximum height difference between the two neighboring columns . to overcome this , we need to control the height differences , or",
    " gradients \" along the contour . for this purpose , we work with a sequence of  bounding dynamics \" with gradually decreasing boundary conditions ( these correspond to the @xmath44 repetitions of the basic result mentioned earlier ) ; since the boundary conditions are  intuitively at least  the source of large gradients , this gives us control of the gradients . as a result",
    ", we are able to cut the simulation overhead between the local and non - local dynamics to  @xmath1 .",
    "we note that this sequence of bounding dynamics captures some of the intuition about the actual evolution of the contour .",
    "( iv )  making rigorous the above bound on gradients requires detailed information about the non - equilibrium shape of the contour , which is notoriously difficult to obtain .",
    "we get around this difficulty by starting the bounding dynamics _ in equilibrium _ , but _ conditioned on a certain rare event  @xmath49 . _",
    "( the conditioning is necessary to ensure that the bounding property holds . ) by choosing  @xmath49 such that its probability , though tiny , is nonetheless much larger than the probability of large gradients in equilibrium , we are able to argue that large gradients do not occur during the evolution .",
