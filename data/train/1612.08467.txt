    "if we choose the reflectivities of the coupling beam splitter and input / output pinhole appropriately such that @xmath86 is very close to the cavity s band edge @xmath87 , the cavity changes from being totally reflective to being strongly absorptive to the incident light over a narrow frequency range @xmath88 .",
    "this results in a desired steep skirt slope as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filter ] ( b ) . unfortunately , because of the frequency dependence of the group velocity , for such a choice of @xmath86 the absorption is poor at the center of the stopband , leading to an insufficient in - band rejection ratio which manifests as the hump at the bottom of the filter function in fig .",

    "imperfections such as photon losses will degrade the performance of the optical devices .",
    "intrinsic loss due to the finite finesse of the cavity can be very low as long as high quality cavities are used nagorny2003collective .",
    "photon losses can also be introduced by phase modulators due to absorption by their optical media and slms because of their limited resolution and fabrication error .",
    "such losses can be made very low @xcite ( see supplementary materials ) , and further reduced by the fact that the auxiliary cavity is designed using destructive interference with very few photons in it .",
    "the low reflectivity pinhole manifests as an photon loss that decreases rapidly with the oam number ( see supplementary materials ) . for the quantum memory ,",
    "the storage time ( for a fixed storage efficiency ) decreases rapidly with the increase of photon losses .",
    "photon losses due to the phase modulators and slms are the limiting factors for the storage time , since their effect is persisting , even during the storage phase when the signal is frozen at large oam states . we find that for the optical filter , the shape factor and stop bandwidth are less sensitive to imperfections of these optical elements , as confirmed by our numerical simulation .",
    "even with the limitations posed by these practical considerations , the oam - based quantum memory has a few attractive characteristics and note - worthy advantages that are not available in existing schemes .",
