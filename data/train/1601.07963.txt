    "biological channels are responsible for regulating the fluxes of ions and molecules ( hereafter referred to as particles for short ) across membranes and , therefore , are critically important for the cell functioning @xcite . as well - known , these protein channels are very efficient in the sense that they support a very fast , selective , and robust across - membrane transport , regardless of environment fluctuations @xcite . surprisingly , such privileged properties have been observed even in the case of large water - filled channels , where the particle transport does not involve the use of metabolic energy or conformational changes and was assumed to be simply diffusive @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of this channel - facilitated particle movement ( cfpm ) is crucially important from the fundamental molecular biology as well as the application point of view ( many modern drugs are developed in the way of using the ion - channels to enhance their efficiency , see for example refs.@xcite ) .    experimentally , there are accumulative data showing that the observed cfpm is really resulted from some interaction between the moving particle and the channel - interior lining @xcite",
    ". recent advancements of high - resolution current recording enable single - channel measurements that provide directly a living picture of how an individual channel functions and , therefore , shed light on the characteristics of channel current in dependence on different ( channel and environment ) parameters @xcite .",
    "however , revealing exactly the nature of channel - particle interaction as well as the mechanism of cfpm is still very experimentally problemic due to the puzzled complexities related to both the channel structure and the measurement systems .    theoretically , to describe the cfpm several models have been suggested .",
    "considering the one - dimensional ( 1d ) diffusion model with a position - dependent diffusion coefficient , berezhkovskii et al .",
    "supposedly introduced a square potential well , spanning the whole channel length , that brings about a channel - particle interaction @xcite .",
    "it was then shown that at a given solute concentration difference there exists an optimum potential well depth that can maximize the particle current , facilitating the channel function . in this model",
    "@xmath0 the channel is assumed large enough so that all the effects related to the particle size can be omitted , @xmath1 a single - particle diffusion is considered , neglecting all many particle correlations , and , particularly , @xmath2 no realistic potential was assigned as the source for the square potential well introduced .",
    "bauer and nadler considered a similar 1d diffusion model with a square potential well that is however associated locally with only the particle bound temporarily inside the channel @xcite . using the macroscopic version of fick s equation",
    ", it was then demonstrated that a transport increase always occurs for any square potential wells .",
    "however , as already noted by the authors , the square potential well exploited in this model is also rather crude and a more realistic potential should be found @xcite . from the very other point of view , kolomeisky models the channel as a set of discrete binding sites arranged stochastically @xcite .",
    "in such the discrete - state model the particles are assumed to hop along the binding sites in translocations across the channel and the optimum current may be achieved depending on the spatial distribution of binding - sites and the site - particle interactions @xcite .",
    "this model is so simple that the main dynamic properties of the problem can be calculated exactly .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the discrete - state model @xcite and the continuum diffusion model @xcite are closely related and can be effectively mapped into each other @xcite . nevertheless , like the square potential well in the continuum models @xcite , the nature of the binding sites ( a kind of channel - particle interaction ) and the hopping mechanism of particles in the discrete - state model @xcite still need to be identified .",
    "importantly , in all the models mentioned @xcite the channel - particle interaction ( which was expressed by a square potential well or a binding site ) is generally viewed as the crucial condition for the transmembrane transport to be facilitated ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note again that in these models the particle motion is merely considered one - dimensional .",
    "recently , dettmer et al . have measured the diffusivity of spherical particles in closely - confining , finite length channels @xcite .",
    "measurements demonstrated a strongly anisotropic diffusion in the channel interior : while the diffusion coefficient parallel to the channel axis remained constant throughout the entire channel interior , the perpendicular diffusion coefficient showed an almost linear decrease from the axis towards the channel wall .",
    "these observations put forward a need for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) description with direction - dependent diffusion coefficients when studying the movement of particles inside a large channel .",
    "furthermore , experimentally , the single channel kinetics was extensively studied at different external voltages @xcite . and , the experimental sublinear current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics reported in refs.@xcite is often used as one of the basic requirements for theoretical models @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a 2d diffusive movement of particles through a large water - filled channel , taking into account an anisotropy of diffusion coefficients as observed in ref.@xcite and an influence of external voltage as discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the channel is modeled as a cylinder characterized by three structure parameters : radius , length , and surface density of negative charges of channel interior - lining .",
    "the potential created by this charged interior - lining inside the channel is exactly calculated .",
    "it causes the  channel - particle interaction \" that plays a key role in facilitating the transmembrane particle movement . solving the 2d stochastic langevin equation for the model",
    "suggested we systematically analyze the typically dynamical characteristics of particles such as the translocation probabilities , the translocation times , the currents , and the channel ion conductance under the influence of various factors : the channel - induced potential , the external voltage , or the difference in reservoir particle concentrations .",
    "it was particularly shown that to facilitate the transmembrane particle movement the channel should be reasonably self - optimized with appropriate structure parameters so that its potential coincides with the resonant one .",
    "in addition , this facilitation is very selective in the sense that a channel of definite structure parameters can facilitate the transmembrane movement of only particles of proper valence at corresponding temperatures .",
    "so , the model suggests that facilitating the transmembrane particle movement is an intrinsic property of biological channels .",
    "this property is independent of the external factors such as the external voltage or the bulk particle concentration gradient , though these factors may strongly influence the magnitude of various particle dynamical characteristics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.ii introduces the 2d diffusion model for the problem under study , including the motion equation with an exact expression of the channel - induced potential , and describes the calculating method .",
    "sec.iii presents the main numerical results obtained .",
    "these results are discussed in great detail , showing the influence of various factors on the particle dynamical characteristics .",
    "a particular attention is given to the self - optimized property of the channels in facilitating the transmembrane particle movement .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief summary in the last sec.iv",
    "we consider a cylindrical channel of length @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 that connects the two reservoirs with particle concentrations @xmath5 and @xmath6 as schematically drawn in fig.1@xmath7 .",
    "the channel interior - lining carries negative charges which are for simplicity assumed to be continuously and regularly distributed with a surface density @xmath8 .",
    "( the cation channels are believed to contain a net negative charge in the pore lining region of the protein @xcite . in the case of potassium and gramicidin channels",
    "this is due to the partially charged carbonyl oxygens @xcite ) .",
    "these negative surface charges create an electrostatic potential @xmath9 which affects the movement of particles inside the channel .",
    "particles are assumed to diffuse independently , neglecting any many - particle correlation .",
    "in addition , the diffusivity of a particle inside the channel is assumed anisotropic with the two different diffusion coefficients , @xmath10 ( parallel with ) and @xmath11 ( perpendicular to the channel axis ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we assume that @xmath0 @xmath10 is constant throughout the channel cylinder [ @xmath12 and @xmath13 and somewhat smaller than the diffusion coefficient @xmath14 in the bulk , @xmath15 with @xmath16 [ we choose in the present work @xmath17 for definition ] and @xmath1 @xmath11 linearly decreases as @xmath18 going from the channel axis ( where the diffusion is isotropic ) to the channel wall , @xmath19 d_z$ ] .",
    "the model also involves a longitudinal voltage @xmath20 , i.e. the difference in electrical potential between the two channel ends , that may include the intrinsic membrane potential @xcite and/or some externally applied voltage @xcite .",
    "this voltage drives the particles moving along the channel . for definition",
    ", we assumed that the voltage @xmath20 is directed from the left to the right [ in fig.1@xmath7 ] and the charge @xmath22 carried by a particle is positive .",
    "actually , due to the cylindrical symmetry of the channel model suggested , the motion of a particle inside a channel can be effectively described by the 2d stochastic differential equation ( langevin equation for overdamped motion ) :    @xmath23    [ t ]   model of the cylindrical channel under study ; @xmath24 channel - induced potential @xmath25 of eq.(3 ) is plotted for the channel with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 [ note : @xmath28 is symmetrical with respect to the sign of @xmath18 ] ; @xmath30 the @xmath31-potential well ( red - solid line , see the left and bottom axes ) and the @xmath32-potential barrier ( blue - dashed line , see the right and top axes ) for the potential @xmath28 in @xmath24 .",

    ", fig.1@xmath24 shows the potential @xmath28 of eq.(3 ) for the channel with @xmath57 , and @xmath27 . at a given @xmath18-coordinate",
    ", @xmath58 behaves as a symmetrical potential well with the absolute minimum at @xmath59 . on the contrary ,",
    "given a @xmath41-coordinate , the @xmath60-curve describes a symmetrical potential barrier with the absolute maximum at @xmath61 [ see , for example , @xmath31 as a function of @xmath41 ( bottom and left axes ) and @xmath32 as a function of @xmath18 ( top and right axes ) in fig.1@xmath30 ] .",
    "while the well shape of the channel potential @xmath28 in the @xmath41-direction directly affects the movement of particles across the channel ( as will be seen below ) , its barrier shape in the @xmath18-direction demonstrates a noticeable role of the transverse motion in the anisotropic 2d - diffusion model considered .    as a consequence of the observed symmetrical shape",

    "fig.1@xmath30 indicates the potential @xmath67 for the channel potential @xmath28 examined in this figure .",
    "thus , as an extension of the model suggested by berezhkovskii et al.@xcite , the present model is distinguished by the main factors as follows : @xmath0 the diffusion is anisotropically two - dimensional ( see eq.(1 ) ) , @xmath1 the negatively charged channel interior - lining creates inside the channel a potential that leads to the first term in the right hand of eq.(1 ) and that can be exactly identified as a function of only channel structure parameters ( see eq.(3 ) ) , and @xmath2 the external voltage causes a driving force expressed by the second term in the right hand of eq.(1 ) .",
    "further , the study will be focused on showing how these factors affect the dynamical characteristics of particles moving through the channel .",
    "the dynamical characteristics we are here interested in include the translocation probabilities , the translocation times , the particle current , and the ion conductance .",
    "to calculate these quantities we have to solve eq.(1 ) .",
    "reasonably , this stochastic equation can be solved numerically by using the molecular dynamics method @xcite .",
    "a particle enters the channel from either the left ( @xmath68 ) or the right ( @xmath69 ) at random with the probabilities proportional to the reservoir particle concentration @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively [ fig.1@xmath7 ] .",

    "started from the given initial conditions , a discrete trajectory of the particle is step by step constructed .",
    "given the channel potential @xmath28 and the external voltage @xmath20 , in each time - step ( @xmath73 ) the random forces , @xmath74 , are independently generated and then the final coordinates and velocity of the particle are determined from eq.(1 ) using the well - known euler scheme @xcite . in the @xmath18-direction",

    "the next particle enters the channel and undergoes a diffusion process in the same way as described above .",
    "the number of particles involved in getting each of average values of studied dynamical quantities is so large that for all the data points presented below the error bar nowhere exceeds the symbol size [ @xmath77 to @xmath78 particles depending on the quantity and the direction of movement investigated ] .",
    "the time step is taken to be @xmath79 , which is believed small enough .",
    "the dynamical quantities we are interested in , as mentioned above , include the translocation probabilities , the average translocation times , the net particle current , and the ion conductance .    actually , the calculating method we exploit in this study is the brownian dynamics . by solving the langevin equation",
    ", this method is rather appropriate for the problem of interest .",
    "a systematical classification of computational approaches proposed and employed for studies of ion channels can be found in the review paper @xcite . here , in solving numerically eq.(1 ) , for convenience we choose @xmath3 as the unit of length , @xmath80 as the unit of time , and @xmath81 as the unit of energy .",

    ", the channel ion conductance , defined as the ratio of @xmath130 to @xmath90 @xcite , becomes dependent on the applied voltage .",
    "the @xmath152-curves in fig.7@xmath7 reveal that as @xmath90 increases the conductances @xmath153 decrease fast first at small @xmath90 , reach a minimum at @xmath154 , and then slightly increase at higher @xmath90 ( see , for example , the inset in fig.7@xmath24 for the case @xmath132 ) .",
    "the voltage , where the conductance gets minimal , depends on the potential @xmath89 and the reservoir particle concentrations . to look for a possible relation between the channel ion conductance and the resonant channel potential @xmath144 associated with the current [ fig.6 ] , we present in fig.7@xmath24 the conductances @xmath150 calculated for channels of different potentials @xmath89 at the same voltage @xmath90 .",
    "remarkably , at any @xmath90 the conductance @xmath150 always has the maximum at the same @xmath132 as that identified in fig.6 for the current .",
    "so , fig.7@xmath24 gives one more demonstration for the resonantly self - organized property of channels in facilitating the transmembrane particle movement .",
    "the @xmath90-dependence of @xmath150 in this figure is related to the sublinear behavior of the i - v curves in fig.7@xmath7 as just discussed above ( see the inset in fig.7@xmath24 ) .",
    "note that such the sublinearity of calculated @xmath155 curves qualitatively resembles experimental data reported refs.@xcite .",
    "[ t ] -curves for different @xmath11 ( indicated in the figure ) are compared to show the role of the transverse diffusion in the 2d - diffusion model considered [ @xmath156 , @xmath157 , other parameters are the same as in fig.2 ] .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , fig.8 compares the @xmath146-curves obtained for different @xmath11 in showing the role of the transverse diffusion in the 2d - diffusion model under study .",
    "four cases presented are : ( 1 ) @xmath158 , implying the 1d - diffusion , ( 2 ) @xmath159 , implying an anisotropically 2d - diffusion with @xmath11 constant and smaller than @xmath10 , ( 3 ) @xmath160 , implying an isotropically 2d - diffusion , and ( 4 ) @xmath161 d_z$ ] used in this work ( see corresponding symbols given in the figure ) .",
    "obviously , the curve in the case of 1d - diffusion is largely separated from the rest , showing an essential role of the transverse diffusion . in this limiting case",
    "there has also the maximum in the @xmath146-curve , however , the current peak is lower and the resonant potential is much larger ( @xmath162 ) , compared to those for 2d - diffusion models .",
    "interestingly , all the three 2d - diffusion @xmath146-curves with @xmath11 different on the behavior or the value show very similar forms with the same resonant potential @xmath136 .",
    "in addition , the isotropic 2d - diffusion model , @xmath160 , provides the highest current peak .",
    "we have considered an anisotropic 2d - diffusion of a charged molecule ( particle ) through a large biological channel under an external voltage .",
    "connecting the two reservoirs with different particle concentrations , the channel is modeled as a rigid cylinder characterized by the three structure parameters : the radius , the length , and the surface density of the negative charges of channel interior - lining .",
    "these negative charges induce inside the channel a potential that is uniquely determined by the channel structure parameters and that critically affects the transmembrane particle movement .",
    "the suggested model is rather phenomenological so that the channel - induced potential can be calculated exactly .",
    "nevertheless , it serves well to gain an understanding of the physical mechanism of the channel - facilitated particle movement .",
    "more detailed quantitative models are required to describe concrete realistic biological channels ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "our study is concentrated on showing the influences of this channel - induced potential and the external voltage on the typical dynamical characteristics of particles such as the translocation probabilities , the average translocation times , the net current , and the channel ion conductance .",
    "it was shown that while the external voltage does not cause any especial effect , the channel potential increases both the translocation probabilities and the average translocation times . and ,",
    "surprisingly , studies demonstrated a single average translocation time that is equally applied for the particles passing the channel in two contrary directions , regardless of even the directed influence of the external voltage .",
    "the most interesting result was appeared in examining the particle current .",
    "it was shown that at a given temperature the channel with appropriate structure parameters can induce the resonant potential that effectively facilitates the transmembrane movement of the particles of a given valence , resulting in a very large net particle current across the channel .",
    "in other words , to facilitate the transmembrane particle movement the channel should be naturally self - optimized so that its potential coincides with the resonant one .",
    "the resonant potential is an intrinsic characteristics of the channel and facilitating the transmembrane particle movement is an intrinsic property of biological channels , independent of the external factors such as the external voltage or the particle concentration gradient .",
    "in addition , the observed cfpm is very selective in the sense that a channel of definite structure parameters can facilitate the transmembrane movement of only particles of proper valence at corresponding temperatures .",
    "calculated current - voltage characteristics also show that the channel model is non - ohmic .",
    "the full characteristics of conductance exhibit an absolute maximum at the same resonant channel potential as that identified in the currents .",
    "it should be conclusively noted that all the results presented above are principally related to the considered single particle model , neglecting all the effects associated with the many - particle couplings , the particle size , and the potential induced by particle itself .",
    "so , these results might be served as an argument for further studies .",
