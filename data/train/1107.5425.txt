    "several decades of experimental and theoretical work on electron scattering have provided a wealth of information on nuclear structure and dynamics  @xcite .",
    "additional information on nuclear properties is in principle available from neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "the main aim of neutrino experiments , however , is not to investigate nuclear properties , but to determine neutrino properties . in neutrino oscillation experiments",
    "neutrino - nucleus scattering is used to detect neutrinos and a proper analysis of data requires that the nuclear response to neutrino interactions is well under control and that the unavoidable theoretical uncertainties on nuclear effects are reduced as much as possible .",
    "different models developed and successfully tested in comparison with electron - scattering data have been extended to describe nuclear effects in neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "although the two situations are different , electron scattering is the best available guide to determine the predictive power of a nuclear model .",
    "nonrelativistic and relativistic models have been developed to describe nuclear effects with different approximations . in general , they can be considered as different and alternative models .",
    "relativity is however important at all energies , in particular at high energies , and in the energy regime of many neutrino experiments a fully relativistic approach is required , where not only relativistic kinematics is considered , but also nuclear dynamics and current operators should be described within a relativistic framework .",
    "models for the exclusive and inclusive electron and neutrino scattering in the qe region are presented in this contribution . in the qe region",
    "the nuclear response is dominated by the mechanism of one - nucleon knockout , where the probe interacts with a quasifree nucleon that is emitted from the nucleus with a direct one - step mechanism and the remaining nucleons are spectators . in electron - scattering experiments the outgoing nucleon can be detected in coincidence with the scattered electron . in the exclusive @xmath0 reaction the residual nucleus",
    "is left in a specific discrete eigenstate and the final state is completely specified . in the inclusive @xmath1 scattering only the scattered electron",
    "is detected , the final nuclear state is not determined , and the cross section includes all the available final nuclear states .    for an incident neutrino ( antineutrino ) neutral - current ( nc ) and charged - current ( cc ) scattering can be considered @xmath2 in nc scattering only the emitted nucleon can be detected and the cross section is integrated over the energy and angle of the final lepton . also the state of the residual @xmath3-nucleus is not determined and the cross section is summed over all the available final states .",
    "the same situation occurs for the cc reaction if only the outgoing nucleon is detected .",
    "the cross sections are therefore inclusive in the leptonic sector and semi - inclusive in the hadronic sector .",
    "the exclusive cc process where the charged final lepton is detected in coincidence with the emitted nucleon can be considered as well .",
    "the inclusive cc scattering where only the charged lepton is detected can be treated with the same models used for the inclusive @xmath1 reaction .",
    "for all these processes the cross section is obtained in the one - boson exchange approximation from the contraction between the lepton tensor , that under the assumption of the plane - wave approximation for the initial and final lepton wave functions depends only on the lepton kinematics , and the hadron tensor @xmath4 , that contains the nuclear response and whose components are given by bilinear products of the matrix elements of the nuclear current @xmath5 between the initial and final nuclear states , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energy and momentum transfer , respectively . different but consistent models to calculate the components of the hadron tensor in qe electron- and neutrino - nucleus scattering are outlined in the next sections .",
    "for the exclusive @xmath9 reaction nonrelativistic and relativistic models based on the distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) have been developed to calculate the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq.wmn ] ) .",
    "the dwia expression of the matrix elements is the results of the following assumptions  @xcite : i ) an exclusive process is considered , where the residual nucleus is left in a discrete eigenstate @xmath10 of its hamiltonian .",
    "ii ) the final nuclear state is projected onto the channel subspace spanned by the vectors corresponding to a nucleon , at a given position , and the residual nucleus in the state @xmath10 .",
    "this assumption neglects effects of coupled channels and is justified by the considered asymptotic configuration of the final state .",
    "iii ) the ( one - body ) nuclear - current operator does not connect different channel subspaces .",
    "thus , also the initial state is projected onto the selected channel subspace .",
    "this assumption is the basis of the direct - knockout mechanism and is related to the ia .",
    "the amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ eq.wmn ] ) are then obtained in a one - body representation as @xmath11 where @xmath12 the one - body nuclear current , @xmath13 is the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "scattering state of the emitted nucleon , @xmath14 the overlap between the ground state of the target and the final state @xmath10 , i.e. , a s.p . bound state , and the spectroscopic factor @xmath15 is the norm of the overlap function , that gives the probability of removing from the target a nucleon leaving the residual nucleus in the state @xmath10 . in the model the s.p .",
    "bound and scattering states are consistently derived as eigenfunctions of a non hermitian energy dependent feshbach - type optical potential and of its hermitian conjugate at different energies . in standard dwia calculations phenomenological ingredients",
    "are usually employed : the scattering states are eigenfunctions of a phenomenological optical potential determined through a fit to elastic nucleon - nucleus scattering data and the s.p .",
    "bound states are obtained from mean - field potentials , or can be calculated in a phenomenological woods - saxon well .",
    "the model can be formulated in a similar way within nonrelativistic dwia and relativistic rdwia frameworks  @xcite . in rdwia ,",
    "calculations are performed with a relativistic nuclear - current operator and four - vector relativistic wave functions for the s.p . bound and",
    "scattering states .",
    "both dwia and rdwia models have been quite successful in describing a large amount of @xmath9 data in a wide range of nuclei and in different kinematics  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the experimental recoil - momentum distributions corresponding to a particular state of the residual nucleus are well described by model calculations .",
    "then , the spectroscopic factors are usually extracted from the comparison between experimental and theoretical results as the reduction factors that must be applied to the calculated cross sections to reproduce the magnitude of the experimental cross sections .",
    "recently , the nonrelativistic dwia and relativistic rdwia models widely and successfully adopted to describe data in a wide range of stable nuclei have been applied to nuclei with neutron excess , with the aim to study the evolution of the @xmath9 cross sections as a function of the asymmetry between the number of neutrons and protons  @xcite .",
    "for the semi - inclusive nc and cc processes where only the outgoing nucleon is detected , the transition amplitudes can be calculated in the same rdwia model of eq .",
    "[ eq.dko ] . since the outgoing lepton is not detected , the cross section must be integrated over the energy and angle of the outgoing lepton .",
    "the state of the residual nucleus is not determined and the cross section includes all the states @xmath10 . in the calculations",
    "@xcite a pure shell - model ( sm ) description is assumed , i.e. , @xmath10 is a one - hole state and the sum over @xmath10 is over all the occupied sm states . in @xcite fsi",
    "are described by a complex optical potential whose imaginary part gives an absorption that reduces the calculated cross section .",
    "a similar reduction is found in @xmath9 calculations .",
    "the imaginary part of the optical potential accounts for the fact that in the elastic scattering , if other channels are open besides the elastic one , part of the incident flux is lost in the elastically scattered beam and goes to the inelastic channels that are open . in the exclusive scattering , where only one channel is considered ,",
    "it is correct to include the absorptive imaginary part of the optical potential and account for the flux lost in the considered channel , but in the inclusive scattering , where all the channels are included , the flux lost in a channel must be found in the other channels , and in the sum over all the channels the flux can be redistributed but must conserved .",
    "thus , the use of the absorptive imaginary part of the optical potential in the inclusive scattering seems inconsistent with the requirement of flux conservation . for the semi - inclusive process where the emitted nucleon is detected , some of the reaction channels which are responsible for the imaginary part of the potential like multistep processes , fragmentation of the nucleus , etc .",
    ", are not included in the experimental cross section .",
    "there are , however , contributions that are not considered in this model and that can be contained in the experimental cross section . in @xcite the semi - inclusive neutrino scattering is treated as a process where the cross section is obtained from the sum of all the integrated exclusive one - nucleon knockout channels .",
    "we can expect that the description of fsi by means of a complex optical potential that gives absorption can produce cross sections that are smaller than the experimental data .",
    "however , since measurements of cross sections are a hard experimental task , ratios of cross sections have been proposed as alternative quantities that can provide useful informations . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that ratios of cross sections are less sensitive to distortion effects and several ratios are considered in view of the possible determination of the strange quark content of the nucleon .",
    "for the inclusive scattering where only the outgoing lepton is detected the green s function ( gf ) model @xcite has been developed to describe fsi consistently with the exclusive scattering and using the same complex optical potential .    in the gf model , under suitable approximations , that are basically related to the ia , the components of the hadron tensor are written in terms of the s.p .",
    "optical model green s function , whose self - energy the feshbach optical potential .",
    "the explicit calculation of the s.p .",
    "green s function can be avoided by its spectral representation , that is based on a biorthogonal expansion in terms of a non hermitian optical potential @xmath16 and of its hermitian conjugate @xmath17 .",
    "calculations require matrix elements of the same type as the dwia ones in eq .",
    "[ eq.dko ] , but involve eigenfunctions of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the imaginary part gives in one case an absorption and in the other case a gain of flux , and in the sum over @xmath10 the total flux is redistributed and conserved .",
    "the gf approach guarantees a consistent treatment of fsi in the exclusive and in the inclusive scattering and gives a good description of @xmath1 data  @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] the rgf1 and rgf - edai results are compared with the results of the relativistic plane wave ia ( rpwia ) , where fsi are neglected , and with the cross sections obtained when only the real part of the relativistic optical potential ( rrop ) is retained and the imaginary part is neglected .",
    "the rrop approximation conserves the flux but , independently of its numerical results , it is conceptually wrong because the optical potential has to be complex owing to the presence of inelastic channels .    the differences between the rrop , rgf1 , and rgf - edai results are essentially due to the imaginary part of the optical potential .",
    "different parameterizations of the optical potential are available , that are able to give equivalently good descriptions of elastic proton - nucleus scattering data , but correspond to different optical potentials that mainly differ for their imaginary part",
    ". the imaginary part accounts for the overall effects of inelastic channels and is not univocally determined from the elastic phenomenology .",
    "the real terms are very similar and the cross sections calculated in rrop are practically insensitive to the choice of the optical potential . in contrast , the imaginary part is sensitive to the parameterization of the rop and gives the differences shown in the figure .",

    "the rmf model fulfills the dispersion relation and maintains the continuity equation .    the differences between the rmf and rgf results increase with the momentum transfer .",

    "two different processes and caution should be drawn on their comparison .",
    "the different currents and their possible interplay with the other ingredients of the models do not allow an easy comparison .",
    "the numerical differences between the rgf results for electron and neutrino scattering can mainly be ascribed to the combined effects of the weak current , in particular its axial term , and the imaginary part of the rop .",

    "the agreement is better for smaller angles while the data are slightly underpredicted as @xmath47 increases . the discrepancy is larger with rgf1 , that gives in general a lower cross section than rgf - edai , and in the bin @xmath51 gev .",
    "these results give further and clear indication that before drawing conclusions about the comparison with data and about the need to increase the value of the nucleon axial mass a careful evaluation of all nuclear effects is required .",
    "important contributions can be produced by fsi .",
    "both rgf and rmf models , where fsi are described with very different theoretical ingredients , give a good description of the shape of the experimental cross sections .",
    "the rmf generally underpredicts the data , but for lower values of the muon energy and scattering angle .",
    "in contrast , the rgf model can give cross sections of the same magnitude as the experimental ones without the need to increase the standard value of the axial mass .",
    "the larger cross sections in the rgf model are produced by the imaginary part of the rop , that includes the overall effect of inelastic ( nucleonic and non - nucleonic ) channels and that is not univocally determined from the elastic phenomenology .",
    "the choice of the optical potential and a more refined determination of its imaginary part can deserve further investigation .",
    "other contributions , not included in the present calculations , might play an important role in the analysis of ccqe data . results of different models indicate that significant effects can be expected from correlations and meson - exchange currents @xcite or multiple knockout excitations @xcite .",
    "more refined calculations including all these contributions should be performed , but any new contribution should be included consistently in a model .",
    "the authors wish to acknowledge the collaborations that have produced the results reported in this contribution .",
    "in particular , we are grateful to franco pacati , franco capuzzi , juan antonio caballero , jos manuel udas , and maria barbaro for fruitful collaborations .",
