    "an automated next - to - leading order generator for standard model processes is highly desirable @xcite . with recent developments of generalized unitarity @xcite and parametric integration methods @xcite",

    "a first crucial step is the development of stable and fast algorithms for evaluating one - loop amplitudes through generalized unitarity cuts .",
    "a c++ code is especially of interest because of the ease with which it can be integrated in leading - order generators such as c @xcite .",
    "the leading - order code will then be used to compute the cut graphs .",
    "eventually , such a retrofitted generator will be able to generate all necessary amplitudes for a next - to - leading order monte carlo program for any standard model process of interest to the collider experiments .",
    "the full @xmath0-gluon one - loop amplitude can be constructed from the leading colour - ordered amplitudes @xcite , which can be calculated by @xmath1}_n(\\{p_i,\\kappa_i\\})=a^{\\rm cc}_n+r_n$ ] depending on external momenta @xmath2 and polarizations @xmath3 .",
