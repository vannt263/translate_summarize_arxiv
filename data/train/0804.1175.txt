    "in the past decade , wide - field surveys have provided the scientific community with a huge amount of spectroscopic and photometric data , allowing significant progress in our understanding of the universe .",
    "perhaps the most widely known example is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , whose sixth data release has now provided photometry in five bands for more than @xmath0 astronomical objects , as well as spectra of about one million sources ( see @xcite ) over more than @xmath1 square degrees on the sky .",
    "one key to the success of the sdss has been its capability to effectively store , process , and analyze , in a fully automated fashion , the vast amount of data gathered during survey operations .",
    "this goal was achieved by using dedicated and well - designed software pipelines , updated during survey operations with reprocessing for the delivery of new data releases . in the coming years , many general purpose astronomical surveys are slated to begin taking data .",
    "these wide - field imaging projects will gather deeper and deeper multi - waveband data over large sky areas , producing ever greater data flows .",
    "the scientific community must manage and analyze the huge wealth of information contained in these enormous datasets .    in this environment",
    ", we have undertaken the development of a new image analysis tool called 2dphot , designed to derive two - dimensional information by analyzing both the surface brightness distributions of individual astronomical sources and the spatial distribution of these sources in the image .",
    "the package includes several tasks , such as star / galaxy classification , measurement of both integrated and surface photometry of galaxies , psf modeling , and estimation of catalog completeness and classification accuracy .",
    "the package is complemented by a graphical interface named 2dgui",
    ". a schematic view of the 2dphot environment is shown in fig .",
    "[ dbfig ] .",
    "briefly , the environment is conceived as follows . to start processing ,",
    "the input images are uploaded to a computer system ( e.g. a local cluster or a grid computer ) via the 2dgui interface .",
    "2dgui also allows the user to configure the 2dphot input parameters . a scheduler is also included , allowing timed and sequential execution of several 2dphot runs to be performed on the same computer .",
    "the actual image analysis is done by the 2dphot package , which is the core of the whole environment . during execution ,",
    "several output tables and plots are produced , showing the different steps of the image analysis and providing a means of quality control .",
    "these data , which can also be directly downloaded from the user through the 2dgui interface , are all uploaded into a database system ( by the 2dload application , see fig .",
    "[ dbfig ] ) .",
    "this system produces a master catalog , by cross - matching 2dphot output results with information provided from other vo - compliant web services , and allows the user to perform data queries on this master catalog .",
    "there are several survey projects for which the 2dphot environment has already been partly implemented or will be implemented .",
    "we have automatically processed the @xmath2- and @xmath3-band images from the palomar abell cluster survey  @xcite , with the main goal of measuring structural parameters , i.e. the effective radius , the corresponding mean surface brightness , and the srsic index @xmath4 of galaxies in clusters with different richnesses , in the redshift range of 0.05 to 0.2 .",
    "the structural parameters have been used to estimate the environmental dependencies of internal color gradients in early - type galaxies ( see @xcite )",
    ". some examples of general purpose imaging surveys to be analyzed by 2dphot are those carried out with the vlt survey telescope ( vst ) , a 2.6 m diameter imaging telescope equipped with a large format ( 16k x16k pixels ) ccd camera yielding a 1 square degree field of view .",
    "the vst , which will be located at the eso cerro paranal observatory ( chile ) , has been designed and constructed under a joint venture of eso and the capodimonte astronomical observatory ( oac ) .",
    "several survey projects will be carried out with capodimonte s vst guaranteed time .",
    "one of the most interesting science cases for the development of 2dphot is the kilo - degree survey with vst ( kids , see  @xcite ) , a public survey project which will image 1500 square degrees of the southern sky in the @xmath5@xmath2@xmath3@xmath6 bands . as shown in a forthcoming paper @xcite ,",
    "applying 2dphot to a moderately deep survey such as vst - kids allows detection and measurement of massive galaxy clusters up to redshift @xmath7 with high completeness .",
    "this cluster abundance measurement can be used to set strong constraints on the dark energy equation of state , which is one of the most crucial issues of modern observational and theoretical cosmology .",
    "reliable star - galaxy separation , with accurate estimates of contamination at very faint flux levels , as well as an accurate cluster detection algorithm are among the 2dphot features of paramount importance for such a dark energy project .",
    "this paper presents the 2dphot package , describing the image analysis strategy on which it is based , as well as all the algorithms which are implemented for the different tasks the package performs .",
    "we also describe briefly the web - based graphical interface .",

    "2dphot works on both single - chip and wide - field ( up to 16000x16000 pixels ) images with a set of input parameters provided either at the invocation of the shell script through a command line syntax or a corresponding graphical interface ( see sec .  [ interf ] ) .",
    "thus , the package can be used either as a standalone application or via a dedicated web - based interface .",
    "the list of input parameters along with short descriptions is provided in appendix  [ inpar ] .",

    "all of these tasks are part of an image analysis flow and are strictly linked with each other such that the output from one task is used as input to the subsequent tasks .",
    "figure  [ flow ] provides a graphical representation of this flow , where the boxes represent different steps in the image analysis and the arrows follow the image processing timeline .",
    "the package starts by running s - extractor  @xcite on the input image through an iterative procedure , allowing simultaneous measurement of the seeing fwhm and removal of spurious object detections .",
    "stamp and mask images are then extracted for each object in the cleaned catalog , and are used to model the psf across the field and to obtain a coarse estimate of the srsic parameters of the detected sources . using both the s - extractor stellarity index and the coarse effective radius estimates , 2dphot performs star / galaxy classification .",

    "star / galaxy separation is performed on the basis of the s - extractor stellarity index @xmath8 and the effective radius parameter @xmath9 ( see sec .  [ whyparam ] ) . in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the stellarity index ,",

    "2dphot generates a preliminary list of candidate stars . the peak value @xmath13 and the width @xmath14 of the fwhm distribution of these objects is derived using the bi - weight estimator ( beers et al .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 define what we call the _ sure star locus _",

    "similar figures showing the sure star locus and the sure stars are automatically produced during each run of 2dphot .",
    "after sure stars are defined , the catalog is cleaned of spurious detections by excluding all sources 3@xmath14 below the sure star locus .",
    "objects whose distance from the image edges , in units of their fwhm value , is smaller than _ redge _ , where _ redge _ is one of the input 2dphot parameters ( see appendix  a ) , are also excluded from the analysis since their photometry can be incomplete and/or corrupted .",
    "for each detected source , 2dphot extracts an image section ( stamp ) centered on the source .",
    "the area of the stamp is proportional to the @xmath17 output by s - extractor such that a wide sky region around the central object is also included in the stamp .",
    "this allows a reliable estimate of the local background to be obtained from the two - dimensional fitting program ( see sec .",
    "[ 2dfit ] ) . for each stamp , a mask image is also produced by flagging all the pixels that belong to all the other sources in the input image whose isophotal areas overlap the given stamp .",
    "the isophotal areas are defined through the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and position angle ( @xmath19 ) parameters from s - extractor , by multiplying the @xmath17 value by an expansion factor @xmath20 ( with a default value of 1.5 ) , which is an input parameter of 2dphot .",
    "this expansion factor allows us to mask also the faintest diffuse external regions of each object .",
    "sources whose isophotal areas overlap the central source by more than @xmath21 are not masked out and are analyzed simultaneously with the central object ( see secs .",

    "the isophotes of each moffat function are described by ellipses , whose shape is modulated with a sin / cos angular expansion , similar to that adopted for describing deviations of the isophotal shape of early - type galaxies from pure ellipses ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the number of fitted stars is given by the lesser of the number of available sure stars and the 2dphot input parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the value of @xmath25 is chosen as a compromise between the computation time for the fitting algorithm and the accuracy of the psf model .",

    "2dphot provides two psf modeling options . in the first case ,",
    "a global psf model is obtained by simultaneously fitting @xmath25 stars randomly extracted from the entire list of sure stars . as a second option",
    ", 2dphot can construct a two - dimensional grid on the input image and derive a psf model independently for each cell , by randomly selecting up to @xmath25 stars among the available sure stars .",
    "psf models are only derived for cells including at least two sure stars .",
    "the cell size has to be provided through the 2dphot input parameter @xmath26 .",
    "2dphot associates to the psf model of each cell the median values of the x and y coordinates of the corresponding fitted sure stars and the two - dimensional modeling of each galaxy ( sec .  [ 2dfit ] ) is performed by using its closest psf model . in order to avoid a discretely varying psf across the chip",
    ", the user can also choose to adopt a locally interpolated psf model .",
    "for each galaxy , 2dphot selects the psf models of the cells around the galaxy itself , and performs a bi - linear interpolation of the selected models at the galaxy position .",
    "since there is a strong correlation between the fitting parameters of each psf model , 2dphot does not derive the local psf model by interpolating each single fitting parameter .",
    "instead , the interpolation is performed independently for each pixel of the psf models , by interpolating the corresponding intensity values .    prior to fitting the psf",
    ", 2dphot applies a clipping procedure to remove stars that might be contaminated by nearby objects . for each star ,",
    "all of the other sure stars are co - registered to the same center coordinates and median stacked .",
    "an rms image is constructed by estimating , at each position , the standard deviation of the stacked pixels .",
    "the mask images of the sure stars are then updated by flagging all the pixels which deviate by more than 5@xmath14 from the corresponding median images .",
    "if the fraction of flagged pixels is larger than @xmath27 of the total mask image area , the sure star is considered to be strongly contaminated and it is excluded from the psf fitting .",
    "this procedure allows faint sources which may not have been detected by s - extractor to be masked , and to exclude objects which are misclassified or blended with nearby sources .",
    "some examples of the clipping and mask update algorithms are shown in fig .",

    "the latter figure is automatically produced by 2dphot .",
    "2dphot produces an initial estimate of structural parameters for all objects in the input image using a discrete , coarse two - dimensional fitting algorithm ( ini2df ) . for each object , a set of psf - convolved srsic models is constructed by varying the effective radius @xmath28 , the total magnitude @xmath29 , and the srsic index @xmath4 . `",
    "geometric ' parameters , such as the center coordinates , the axis ratio and the position angle of the models are estimated by fitting the object image with a single 2d moffat function , and are kept fixed during the coarse fitting .",
    "the moffat fit is performed by excluding the inner part of the object , which is strongly affected by seeing .",
    "the local background value is also not changed in the fit and is obtained from the keyword @xmath23 in the mask image header ( see sec .",
    "[ stamps ] ) .",
    "ini2df changes the effective radius of the srsic model using an adaptive grid of 10 values computed on the basis of both the pixel scale and the seeing fwhm of the image .",
    "four different values are considered for the srsic index parameter , @xmath30 , while the total magnitude can take the values @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the kron magnitude of the source ( s - extractor @xmath33 ) .",
    "we point out that the grids of @xmath34 , @xmath29 and @xmath4 values have been empirically chosen by analyzing several images with a wide range of characteristics ( e.g. optical and near - infrared data as well as ground - based and hst images ) .",
    "we found that further increasing the grid size does not change significantly the 2dphot results . with these sizes for the @xmath34 , @xmath29 and @xmath4 grids , ini2df produces a total of @xmath35 discrete models , each of which is compared to the object image by computing the corresponding @xmath36 value .",
    "the coarse structural parameters are given by the parameters of the model with lowest @xmath36 .",
    "in the case that , for a given stamp , several objects have to be treated simultaneously ( see sec .  [ stamps ] ) , the above procedure is modified as follows .",
    "a simultaneous fit is performed by using a single two - dimensional moffat function for each object .",
    "then , for each overlapping object , the others are subtracted using the fitted moffat models .",
    "a corresponding updated mask image is also produced , by flagging all pixels for which the sum of the subtracted moffat models exceeds the local background standard deviation ( @xmath24 in the mask image header , see sec .  [ masks ] ) by @xmath37 .",
    "coarse structural parameters are then obtained by fitting each object in the stamp as a single source , applying the same procedure outlined above .",
    "some examples of this procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ multi ] .",
    "we see that there are some cases where the single moffat models do not result in accurate subtraction of overlapping sources .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the above approach allows reliable estimation of structural parameters , with the great advantage of significantly reduced computational times compared to an approach where overlapping galaxy models are fitted simultaneously ( see also sec .  [ 2dfit ] ) .",
    "the classification of stars and galaxies is one of the most challenging issue in the analysis of astronomical images , and there is no method that works in all scenarios as the optimum classifier . in the current version , 2dphot adopts a simple method of star / galaxy ( hereafter @xmath38 ) separation , which is based on both the s - extractor and the coarse structural parameters estimated by the ini2df procedure ( sec .",
    "[ ini2df ] ) .",
    "the parameters which are used for @xmath38 classification have been chosen on the basis of monte - carlo simulations as detailed in sec .",

    "[ sgrules ] . in the future",
    ", we plan to implement more complex classification techniques ( such as wavelet approaches ) , and provide a detailed comparison of their performance . since there is no method that correctly classifies all sources in a given image , particularly at the faintest flux levels , it is crucial that every classification framework provide an estimate of contamination due to misclassified sources as a function of the s / n ratio . as described in sec .",
    "[ sgrules ] , 2dphot accurately estimates such contamination using simulated stars and galaxies added to the input processed frame .      we adopt a two - step procedure to establish useful parameters for star / galaxy separation .",
    "first , we look for reliable classifiers of point - like sources , i.e. 2dphot output parameters whose values for stellar sources lie in a narrow region of parameter space over wide ranges of the s / n ratio , seeing , and sampling characteristics of the images .",
    "then , we analyze the ability of such classifiers to separate stars and galaxies by examining the distribution of values they assume for both kinds of objects . to address the first point , we created simulated ccd images , each with a random spatial distribution of stars .",
    "the simulations were generated using the same pixel scale ( @xmath39 ) , image size ( @xmath40 pixels ) , and the noise properties as the @xmath3-band images of the palomar abell cluster survey ( hereafter pacs , see gal et al .",
    "the pacs data have been extensively processed from the authors through the 2dphot package in order to investigate the effects of environment on internal color gradients of early - type galaxies ( see la barbera et al .  2005 ) .",
