    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is a successful theory confirmed by numerous measurements since the 1970 s .",
    "after the direct observations of the massive top quark and the @xmath4 at fermilab in 1995 and 2000 , respectively , only one fundamental particle predicted by the sm , the higgs boson , remains to be discovered .",
    "the role of the higgs boson is critical in the sm because fermions and w / z bosons , via a process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , acquire their mass through interactions with the higgs boson fields . in the sm",
    "the higgs boson couplings to all fermions and electroweak gauge bosons depend on their masses .",
    "generically , the sm higgs boson couples most strongly to heavy particles .",
    "however , the sm does nt predict the higgs boson mass , which resulted in a great experimental challenging to search for the higgs boson in a very wide mass range and through many different decay modes .                the leading order ( lo ) sm higgs boson production mechanism at the lhc ( large hadron collider )",
    "is shown by the feynman diagrams in figure [ fig : higgs_feyn ] , including the processes of the gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) , the @xmath5 fusion , the higgs - strahlung and the vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) . the dominant process is the ggf higgs boson as shown in the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) cross - section plot in the figure  [ fig : higgs_xsec ] .",
    "higgs boson production via vbf is also an important production mechanism for higgs boson searches at the lhc with the specific signature of a higgs boson with two hard jets in the final states .",
    "the higgs boson production cross - section is very small compared to the enormous qcd jet productions at the lhc .",
    "the ability to detect and identify the higgs boson decay final states ( see figure [ fig : higgs_decay ] )  @xcite is crucial to the success of the higgs boson discovery .",
    "the direct search at lep sets a lower higgs boson mass limit of 114.4 gev at 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "recent searches at tevatron exclude the higgs boson mass between 160 gev and 170 gev at 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "the electroweak data constraints deduced from consistency conditions of the sm can be used to derive an upper limit of sm higgs boson mass of  190 gev at 95% c.l.@xcite .",
    "therefore the most interesting mass range indicated by direct higgs boson search and indirect constraints is between 114 gev and 190 gev .",
    "as shown in the figure  [ fig : higgs_xsec ] , there are two dominant higgs boson production modes : ggf and vbf , which are in the kinematic region of interest for the @xmath6 decay mode .",
    "when both w bosons decay to leptons , the higgs boson signature includes two energetic leptons with large missing transverse energy in the final state . these two leptons tend to go same direction due to spin correlation . for the vbf higgs boson ,",
    "the final state also includes two hard jets which tend to be well - separated in pseudo - rapidity . the higgs boson signal and major background sources ( sm @xmath7 , @xmath8 , z+jets and w+jets ) are listed in table  [ montecarlo ] .",
    "the mc generators we used to produce mc events and corresponding cross sections are also listed in the table  [ montecarlo ] .    .monte carlo generators and cross sections for the higgs boson signal and background processes .",
    "the w+jets cross sections listed is the cross section per lepton flavor . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ cut_flow_h2j ]    figure  [ fig : higgs_h2j ] shows the distribution of the pseudo - rapidity gap between two tagging jets ( top left ) , invariant mass of two tagging jets ( top right ) , azimuthal angle between two tagging jets ( bottom left ) and transverse energy of the third jet ( bottom right ) . where black solid histograms represent vbf higgs boson signal with @xmath9 gev , green dash - dotted histograms mean ww background , red dotted histograms are @xmath8 and blue dashed histograms are z+jets background .",
    "the following cuts have been applied to selected h + 2j , @xmath10 events .    * two isolated leptons with @xmath11 gev * missing transverse energy @xmath12 gev * at least two jets with @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 * the two jets with highest transverse momentum are required to be in opposite hemispheres with @xmath15 * require that both leptons are between the two leading jets in pseudo - rapidity * reject event which has @xmath16 gev * require transverse mass @xmath17 gev * require transverse mass @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle between the di - lepton vector and the @xmath21 vector in the transverse plane . * to suppress b - related background , b - veto cuts are applied on both tagging jets     at 10 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     at 10 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     at 10 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    table  [ cut_flow_h2j ] shows the cut flows ( in fb ) for @xmath9 gev in the h + 2j , @xmath22 channel .",
    "if the event has @xmath23 and @xmath24 , it lies in the signal box ; otherwise , it lies in the control region .",
    "the trigger efficiency of 99.0% after level 1 , 96.8% after level 2 , and 94.5% afte the event filter .",
    "after the preselection , a four - variable neural network is used to further enhance the separation between the signal and the background .",
    "the inputs to the neural network are :    * @xmath25 , the pseudo - rapidity gap between two tagging jets * @xmath26 , the invariant mass of two tagging jets * the transverse momentum of the leading non - tagging jet in the region @xmath27 * @xmath28 , the pseudo - rapidity gap between two tagging jets and the third non - tagging jet .    the neural network output distribution in the signal box is shown in figure  [ fig : higgs_nnout_h2j ] . the transverse mass distribution for events in the signal box with neural network output larger than 0.8 is shown in figure  [ fig : higgs_mt_h2j ] , where black dots with error bar show pseudo - data , blue curve shows best - fit higgs boson signal , red curve represents 2-lepton background and green curve is faked background from w+jets .",
    "the fit is a two - dimensional fit to the neural network output and transverse mass distributions .",
    "both the signal model and the background model are uncorrelated product probability density functions ( pdfs ) . the neural network output distribution for the background in the signal box is taken to be the same as the distribution in the control region , but it is multiplied by a linear extrapolation factor .",
    "apart from the slope of this extrapolation factor , all parameters governing the shape of the neural network output distribution in the two regions are required to be the same .",
    "the expected significance is shown as a function of the true higgs boson mass in figure  [ fig : higgs_significance_h2j ] .",
    "we expect further improvements for higgs boson detection sensitivity .",
    "the analysis presented above only includes the @xmath29 channel with jet - veto or two forward jet tagging in events . including the @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels and adding dilepton events with 1 jet in final states will certainly increase the detection sensitivity in atlas . based on lep and tevatron higgs boson search experiences ,",
    "the analysis can be carried out by using mativariate techniques , such as artificial neural networks ( ann ) and boosted decision trees ( bdt )  @xcite , which would further improve the detection sensitivities .",
    "atlas physics group has extensively explored these advanced analysis methods  @xcite and fully developed the tools that will be used in higgs boson search program with lhc collision data .     at 10 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     at 10 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the prospects for sm higgs boson searches in the ww decay mode have been studied using a realistic model of the atlas detector .",
    "the h + 0j , @xmath22 channel is very promising for higgs boson masses in the region around the ww threshold . with 10 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity , one would expect to be able to achieve a @xmath32 discovery with the @xmath22 channel alone if there a sm higgs boson with a mass between @xmath33 140 gev and @xmath33 185 gev .",
    "a measurement of the mass of the higgs boson at 10 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity would have a precision of less than 2 gev for higgs mass boson of 160 gev , or a precision of less than 4 gev for higgs boson with mass of 140 gev .",
    "the h + 2j , @xmath22 channel has a smaller event rate than the h + 0j channel . with 10 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity",
    ", we expect to reach @xmath32 discovery if sm higgs boson mass between 150 gev and 180 gev .",
    "the combined mass determination for the combined fit of h + 0/2j is shown in figure  [ fig : higgs_mass_combined ] .",
