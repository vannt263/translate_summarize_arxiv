    "the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies have been well known for decades , e.g. , @xcite , assuming the validity of the newtonian law of gravity throughout , this results in a discrepancy between the dynamical mass and the luminous mass of spiral galaxies .",
    "other types of galaxies exhibit mass discrepancies as well , the most remarkable is the case of dwarf spheroidal galaxies for which the velocity dispersion is well known and the mass inferred from their internal dynamics greatly exceeds the visible mass by factors reaching into the thousands e.g. , @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "bright giant elliptical galaxies exhibit small mass discrepancies e.g. , @xcite , usually these facts are commonly interpreted as the manifestation of the dark matter halo in which the different galaxies are immersed .",
    "this halo dominates the dynamic of extended galaxies with low surface brightness , and its presence is less significant in more centrally concentrated galaxies with larger surface brightness values , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the discrepancy between observable mass in galaxies and their dynamics can be interpreted as a direct evidence for the failure of the current newtonian and general relativistic theories of gravity , rather than the existence of a dark matter component . as examples , in spiral galaxies",
    "the flat rotation curve has been successfully interpreted assuming a modification of newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , e.g. , @xcite , or equivalently an extended newtonian force law , e.g. , @xcite , the projected surface density profiles and observational parameters of the local dsph galaxies are in agreement with a description in mond , e.g. @xcite .",
    "similarly , modified gravity approaches have been successful in explaining the general shape of the observed rotation curves of many dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies , e.g. , @xcite , and many other astronomical systems have been interpreted in this context , such as globular clusters ( gcs ) , e.g. , @xcite , the relative velocity of wide binaries in the solar neighbourhood , e.g. , @xcite , the infall velocity of the two component of the bullet cluster , e.g. , @xcite and the gravitational lensing of elliptical galaxies , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "modified gravity proposals not requiring any dark matter generically predict that for accelerations below @xmath5 , one should transit away from newtonian gravity , e.g. mond in @xcite , teves in @xcite , qumond , bimond in @xcite , the extended newtonian force law in @xcite or its relativistic version in @xcite .",
    "regardless of the details , within @xmath2 scales velocities for test particles about spherical mass distributions will become independent of radius , and show a mass scaling coinciding with that of the galactic tully - fisher relation of @xmath6 .",
    "to test the predictions of modified gravity schemes in elliptical galaxies one needs to know the kinematics and mass distribution of these systems .",
    "elliptical galaxies are dynamically hot systems with little or no cold gas where determining their kinematic is more difficult than for spiral galaxies .",
    "their orbital structure is thought to be the result of their evolution through a complex formation process . for determining their dynamics several tracers",
    "have been used , such as x - ray gas , gcs and planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "massive elliptical galaxies are usually surrounded by hot and low density gas evident through its x - ray glow . a tool to determine the mass distribution in these systems is to model their x - ray spectra to obtain density and temperature profiles for the gas , if we assume hydrostatic equilibrium for this component , we",
    "can then obtain the mass distribution and then an estimate of the brightness profile to be compared to the photometrically observed one , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the problem of modeling the luminosity profile and kinematics of elliptical galaxies has been treated before , e.g. , @xcite modelled the brightness profiles of all known elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster using sersic profiles @xmath7 , they develop a mechanism to calculate a realistic error in the sercic parameters and identify departures from these profiles that are diagnostic of galaxy formation processes .",
    "@xcite studied the kinematics of pne in the virgo giant elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 ( m 60 ) , assuming newtonian gravity , they conclude that the kinematics of this object are consistent with the presence of a dark matter halo around m60 , this halo is almost one - half of the total mass of the galaxy within @xmath8 . in @xcite three - integral axisymmetric models for ngc 4649 and ngc 7097 are considered , concluding that the kinematic data of ngc 4649 are consistent with a dynamical model with a moderate amount of dark matter , @xcite create a dynamical model of ngc 4649 using the nmagic code and kinematic constraints to infer a dark matter mass fraction in ngc 4649 of @xmath9 at @xmath10 . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the gc dynamics of ngc 4649 are used as mass tracers and the jeans equation is solved for newtonian and mond models , finding that both are consistent with the values of the observed velocity profile of the galaxy , although considering the light distribution only to first approximation , as a radial power law for the surface brightness profile .    along the same lines , we here treat the massive elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 assuming the modified newtonian force law formulation of @xcite through fully consistent self - gravitating models , as a test of the above ideas .",
    "the free parameters of the galactic model are calibrated to match the details of the observed surface brightness and projected velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "this becomes a valuable test of the physical modelling introduced in @xcite to the modelling of light and velocity dispersion profiles in galactic globular clusters , as the same scheme is now applied to a system which lies orders of magnitude above the globular clusters in size and mass .",
    "we obtain equilibrium models which satisfy all observed parameters of the galaxy in question , including crucially , the flattening of the projected velocity dispersion evident at large radii , in the absence of any unseen dark component . under a purely newtonian framework ,",
    "any accurate modelling of this galaxy requires the inclusion of a substantial amount of dark matter .",
    "in section ( 2 ) we present the modelling used to construct equilibrium models for self - gravitating spherically symmetric stellar populations using the modified newtonian force law of @xcite .",
    "we then show in section ( 3 ) specific models satisfying all observational constraints available for ngc 4649 .",
    "section ( 4 ) gives our conclusions .",
    "in the same way as done for globular clusters in @xcite we have modeled the massive elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 as a population of self gravitating stars in a spherically symmetric equilibrium configuration , under a modified newtonian gravitational force law . for a test particle a distance @xmath11 from the centre of a spherically symmetric mass distribution @xmath12 , the force per unit mass is given by :    @xmath13    in the equation above @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "notice that for @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 and we recover the standard force law , while for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 and the corresponding mondian force law of @xmath22 ensues .",
    "the abruptness of the transition between the two limits is regulated by the index @xmath23 , which satisfies @xmath24 .    in @xcite",
    "the above force law was proven to result in generalised isothermal gravitational equilibrium configurations having well defined and finite @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 values , radii , masses and velocity dispersion , which evolve smoothly from the classical virial equilibrium scaling of @xmath28 to the observed tilt in the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies , to the @xmath29 tully - fisher relation , in going from @xmath17 to @xmath30 to @xmath20 . in that paper",
    "it was also shown that solar system constraints will not be violated , provided that the transition in eq.(1 ) is sufficiently abrupt , @xmath31 , and also that newton s theorems for spherically symmetric mass distributions will continue to be valid , provided only that @xmath32 depends exclusively on the variable @xmath33 .",
    "recently , in @xcite we showed that constructing similarly successful models for globular clusters requires @xmath34 to obtain best fits to brightness and velocity dispersion profiles , here we use @xmath35 to construct equilibrium models for the elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 .",
    "notice also that given the form of the proposed force law , any other larger value of @xmath23 results in only marginal differences from @xmath35 . since any feasible modified force law at the newtonian level evidently requires the form of the force law to be fully fixed across astrophysical systems and scales , here we do not treat @xmath23 as a free parameter , but use always a fixed @xmath35 value . a theoretical grounding for the above modified force law appeared in @xcite , who provided an @xmath36 formal generalization to gr which has as its low velocity limit precisely the mondian force law of eq.(1 ) in the @xmath19 range .",
    "taking the derivative of the kinematic pressure , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a polytropic equation of state @xmath37 is :    @xmath38    in going to locally isotropic maxwellian conditions , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and we get :    @xmath41    since @xmath42 the preceding equation can be written as : @xmath43\\nonumber\\\\ & & = -a_{0 } x \\left ( \\frac{1-x^{n}}{1-x^{n-1 } } \\right ) , \\label{eqhidro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath44 the isotropic maxwellian velocity dispersion for the population of stars .",
    "this is hence an application of the treatment developed in @xcite , where we modeled eight gcs in our galaxy under the same modified force law used here . in that paper",
    "we showed that using a plausible parametric @xmath45 function , self - gravitating models can be easily constructed to accurately reproduce all observational constraints .    once a specific @xmath44 is chosen , using a numerical finite differences scheme and the initial condition of a fixed central density @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 , @xmath48 , for @xmath49 , the second - order differential equation ( [ eqhidro ] ) can be solved .",
    "this solution gives @xmath50 and @xmath12 , volumetric profiles for the density and mass .",
    "projecting @xmath50 along one direction then yields the corresponding @xmath51 , a projected surface density mass profile , which assuming a mass - to - light ratio , can then be compared against an observed surface brightness profile .",
    "we use @xmath11 for radial distances in 3d , and @xmath52 as a projected radial coordinate on the plane of the sky .",
    "lastly , a volume density weighted projection of @xmath44 yields @xmath53 , the corresponding projected velocity dispersion profile .",
    "thus , it is only after solving for the complete density structure that a @xmath53 is obtained .",
    "notice that existing observations only give @xmath53 , the density weighted projected profiles of @xmath44 , and never @xmath44 itself . to solve eq .",
    "( 4 ) we assume a parametric form for @xmath44 , with parameters which will be adjusted to yield full projected models in surface brightness and @xmath53 in accordance with the properties of the observed galaxy",
    ". we shall use :    @xmath54    notice that @xmath55 will be given directly by the observations , since at large radial distances the effects of projection tend to zero and @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 can be obtained from the asymptotic value of the observed projected velocity dispersion profile for the galaxy in question , in this case @xmath57 , following @xcite .",
    "the remaining four free parameters , @xmath46 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , will be fitted to yield projected velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles ( following @xcite we take @xmath61 ) in accordance with the corresponding observed quantities .",
    "we begin this section presenting in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) our best fit ngc 4649 model . the volumetric density profile is shown in figure ( 1 ) , and appears similar to a cored isothermal density distribution , with the difference that at large radii @xmath50 becomes steeper than the newtonian @xmath62 .",
    "the consequence of this steepening is a finite total mass and radius , even using asymptotically flat @xmath44 profiles e.g. @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the newtonian case where classical isothermal spheres of infinite extent appear .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , this finite profiles also appear for the modified gravity law we are using , even under rigorously isothermal @xmath63 equilibrium configurations .",
    "the vertical line shows the radius where the condition @xmath64 is crossed , i.e. , the point beyond which @xmath2 , and hence the departure of the force law used from the newtonian value towards the mondian regime , consequently the point where the density profile steepens away from the @xmath65 of newtonian gravity , towards the convergence of the mondian regime .    the corresponding volumetric radial mass profile is given in figure ( 2 ) , where the vertical line again shows the @xmath64 threshold .",
    "this clearly shows the departure from the linear growth of the total mass within the approximately isothermal newtonian region , towards convergence to a finite total mass in the mondian @xmath2 regime .",
    "we see that @xmath66 of the mass of the modelled galaxy falls outside of the @xmath64 threshold .",
    "this mass appears spread out over large areas , and hence presents much smaller surface densities than those appearing in the central regions interior to the @xmath3 , @xmath64 limit , the more easily observed newtonian central parts .",
    "the consistency of the model is shown in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ; having assumed a positive isotropic maxwellian velocity distribution function , the physical modelling results in a mass density profile in accordance with what a newtonian modelling would have yielded for the inner @xmath3 region , where the force law used reproduces newton s expression . in going to larger radii , @xmath50 steepens increasingly to eventually reach @xmath67 at a finite total radius , as can be seen from the convergence of the mass profile given in figure ( 2 ) .",
    "the distribution function is thus positive throughout the model , going to zero at the outer edge .",
    "the optimum model shown was fitted to agree with the observed projected velocity dispersion and surface brightness profile for ngc 4649 , assuming a constant @xmath68 value , see below .",
    "we take the surface brightness profile observations from photometry in @xcite and the number density calculated from pne in @xcite as scaled in @xcite , and projected velocity dispersion measurements from @xcite adopted from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we take @xmath69 , which coincides with the central value reported by @xcite , determined directly from stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the final resulting surface brightness profile and its corresponding volume density weighted projected velocity dispersion profile @xmath53 for galaxy ngc 4649 are presented in figures(3 ) and ( 4 ) for @xmath69 .",
    "the parameters for the best fit in eq.(5 ) are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the central density that we have assumed is @xmath74 .    regarding the free parameters of the model , @xmath75 and @xmath46 , we began with @xmath73 as used in our gc study of hernandez & jimenez ( 2012 ) , and with a trial @xmath59 at the effective radius of the galaxy , and a trial @xmath58 at the @xmath76 condition , we then performed a least squares fit to the well established projected surface density profile to obtain an optimal @xmath46 value .",
    "the projected @xmath77 profile was then visually examined , and the procedure ended if the model agreed with these more uncertain observations to within their reported error bands . if not , the procedure is repeated with @xmath59 and @xmath58 re - adjusted to yield a larger or smaller central @xmath78 value , or a faster or slower decay in the @xmath53 curve . only at the lowest @xmath79 range were solutions with @xmath73 slightly less good than the ones presented , so the procedure was repeated with slight variations in @xmath60 .",
    "we do not claim the models obtained to be unique , neither did we set out to find final values for our parameters which could be definitively associated to ngc 4649 , merely working models intended to show the plausibility of the force law examined .",
    "we do note however , that the full observed and sersic fit to the projected surface density profile can be reproduced , not only within the observed uncertainties , but actually to an almost indistinguishable level , giving us confidence that some of the physics of the problem have been captured by the modelling presented . at the same time",
    ", the more uncertain projected velocity dispersion profile has also been adequately reproduced , to within the observational confidence intervals .    in the figures the vertical line indicates the point where @xmath80",
    ", we can see that the model accurately fits the observed projected surface brightness profiles of the galaxy and the central value of the measured projected velocity dispersion @xmath81 , as well as the observed profiles for @xmath53 .",
    "we see that both , the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles are in agreement with photometry and pne observations , to within reported uncertainties . under newtonian gravity",
    "this requires to invoke a large amount of dark matter to reproduce the structure and kinematics of this galaxy , using the proposed modified force law however , it is natural that once the change in the gravitational regime appears , @xmath44 will tend to a constant once the mass distribution has converged .",
    "although the projected surface brightness profile of the model shown in figure ( 3 ) is in excellent accordance with the observed one , a value of @xmath69 might appear as somewhat excessive .",
    "indeed , from figure ( 4 ) we see that the projected velocity dispersion of the model systematically exceeds the measurements from long slit observations , and is more in accordance with the more crude pne inferences . to test the range of values in @xmath68 which the physical modelling can accommodate",
    ", we repeated the experiment , taking this time a lower value of @xmath82 .",
    "the results are presented in figures ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , which are analogous to ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "we see a similarly excellent accordance for the projected surface brightness profile in figure ( 5 ) , and a projected velocity dispersion profile in figure ( 6 ) which this time closely follows the more detailed data of the long slit observations , and lies slightly below the pne inferences .",
    "the parameters of this second model are : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath79 ratios higher than @xmath88 appear unphysical from the point of view of pure stellar populations , while models with values lower than @xmath89 result in @xmath77 curves which fall below the observed values .",
    "the range @xmath90 thus brackets the models which can yield accurate simultaneous fits to both the observed surface brightness profile , and the observed velocity dispersion profile of ngc4649 .",
    "the total mass we obtain from the dynamical modeling described is consistent with what results from the integration of the surface brightness profile assuming a constant mass to light ratio @xmath91 .",
    "the mass obtained for the dynamical model to ngc 4649 is @xmath92 , and the luminosity that results from integrating the @xmath93 band light profile is @xmath94 , implying a mass of @xmath95 from using @xmath96 as determined directly from the stellar population studies of @xcite . also , notice that the asymptotic value of the velocity dispersion is @xmath97 in consistency with the @xmath98 prediction of @xcite for @xmath95 , and @xmath99 for the @xmath100 of the @xmath101 case .",
    "models including a degree of orbital anisotropy , constant or with radial variations , are also possible , as are ones considering also some degree of sub - dominant rotation , as often observed in elliptical galaxies .",
    "introducing more free functions would clearly allow even finner fits to the observed restrictions .",
    "we have chosen not to increase the complexity of the modelling in this way , as our aim here is merely to prove that for the simplest isotropic , non - rotating construction , reproducing all the available observational constrains is easily achieved under the modified force tested . as already mentioned , the models presented are not intended as unique definitive fittings to any of the parameters used , merely as examples of plausible models showing the viability of the force law used .",
    "we show that for the massive elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 , fully self consistent spherically symmetric equilibrium models can be constructed using a modified newtonian force law which smoothly transits from the newtonian value when @xmath3 , towards the mondian phenomenology in the @xmath2 regime , which naturally satisfy all observational constraints available for the central , asymptotic and radial profiles for projected surface brightness and velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "all this , without the need of invoking any hypothetical and as yet undetected dark matter component .",
    "we obtain models which show a newtonian inner region , smoothly evolving outwards towards a mondian solution on crossing the @xmath102 limit .",
    "the corresponding velocity dispersion profiles similarly evolve from an internal `` keplerian '' region to an external constant velocity dispersion regime .",
    "we show that the asymptotic value of the observed velocity dispersion profile , @xmath103 , and the total mass for this systems , @xmath26 , are consistent with the generic modified gravity prediction for @xmath104 .",
