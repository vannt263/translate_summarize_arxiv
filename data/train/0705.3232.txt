    "the amount of intercalated water is 0.8 or less , forming only a monohydrate ( k+h@xmath1o ) layer and no superconductivity has been detected yet.@xcite    the k@xmath0coo@xmath1 system has been known for three decades , since hagenmuller and colleagues reported@xcite structure , transport , and magnetic data on phases with @xmath4=1.0 , 0.67 , and 0.50 .",

    "et al . _ with arpes measurements.@xcite",
    "several characteristics of n@xmath0co , in particular the superconductivity upon hydration and effects of cation ordering , suggest that the behavior in this system is sensitive to details of the electronic structure .",
    "the fact that k@xmath3co is similar to n@xmath3co , yet shows clear differences in behavior , indicates that a comparison of the electronic structures of these systems is warranted . in this paper , we compare and contrast the two insulating systems k@xmath3co and n@xmath3co . here",
    "correlation effects and detailed magnetic ordering are neglected , but the observed @xmath26 supercell including na / k zigzag ordering is adopted .",
    "( @xmath27 is the hexagonal lattice constant . )",
    ".crystal structure comparison between k@xmath0coo@xmath1 and na@xmath0coo@xmath1 at @xmath4=0.5 .",
    "the orthorhombic structures ( space group : @xmath28 , no .",
    "59 ) determined from na- or k - zigzag ordering are a @xmath26 superstructure which is based on the hexagonal structure with a lattice constant @xmath27 . in this structure ,",
    "the oxygens have three site symmetries , two @xmath29 and one @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 is an oxygen height from the co layers .",
    "a main difference in these structures is that k@xmath3coo@xmath1 has 12 % larger @xmath32 lattice constant .",

    "@xcite for k@xmath3coo@xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]      these differences between two cobaltates can be clarified in two ways .",
    "first , we can determine the effects purely due to chemical difference ( k vs. na ) as opposed to the size difference leading to structural differences .",
    "for this , n@xmath3co is assigned the same structure as in k@xmath3co and denoted n@xmath3co@xmath33 .",
    "the resulting band structure enlarged near @xmath34 is compared with that of k@xmath3co in fig .",
    "[ band3 ] . even in the identical structure ,",
    "substantial differences on an important energy scale are evident .",
    "the top valence band in n@xmath3co@xmath33 is 20 mev higher in energy at the @xmath35 point , although the @xmath36 bandwidth is about 5% smaller ( not shown ) .",
    "another difference is that the projected k and na dos is almost identical ( and small , of course ) through most of the @xmath36 bands , except in a @xmath37 mev region at and below the fermi level , where the na projected dos ( pdos ) is 20 - 35% larger ( more than 50% larger at e@xmath38 ) .",
    "these distinctions indicate that the differences in electronic structure are mainly due to k substitution itself rather than indirectly through the change in structure .",
    "second , using the mullikan charge decomposition , we obtained atom - decomposed charges , which are displayed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the k ion is very noticeably more ionic than the na ion , consistent with the pdos difference mentioned just above .",
    "the compensating charge is spread over the oxygen ions ; the co charges are essentially the same for k@xmath3co and n@xmath3co@xmath33 .",
    "this higher ionicity of k seems to be the most discernible difference between these cobaltates .",
    "it is still unclear what water does in the system .",
    "the only unambiguously aspect is that hydration dramatically increases the @xmath32 lattice constant , resulting in more two - dimensionality of the electronic system.@xcite however , although the isostructural system na@xmath39tas@xmath1@xmath40h@xmath1o shows very similar change in the @xmath32 lattice constant when hydrated,@xcite @xmath41 k in this system is independent of @xmath42 .",
    "this difference in behavior established that water has effects in the cobaltates that are not present in the transition metal disulfides and diselenides . in this respect",
    "it is interesting that ( na@xmath43k@xmath44)coo@xmath1@xmath450.87h@xmath1o shows superconductivity with @xmath46 k and about 7    increment in @xmath32 lattice constant from k@xmath47co , which is similar in amount to that of hydrated sodium cobaltate.@xcite",
    "using a crystal structure recently reported , we have investigated at the lda level the differences in electronic structure between k@xmath3coo@xmath1 and n@xmath3coo@xmath1 .",
    "comparison shows a few substantial differences near @xmath34 ; smaller @xmath36 bandwidth by 60 mev in k@xmath3coo@xmath1 , and additional fermi surfaces along the @xmath48 line which are almost flat near the @xmath49 point .",
    "these differences are due more to chemical differences ( higher ionic character of k ) rather than to structural difference between the systems .    an angle - resolved photoemission comparison of the three systems a@xmath0coo@xmath1 , a = na , k , and rb , has appeared,@xcite with the differences at equal doping levels being small almost too small to quantify .",
    "unfortunately , samples at precisely @xmath4=0.5 were not the focus of that study . since the superstructure we have studied",
    "is confined to @xmath4=0.5 , our results can not be compared with this data .",
    "however , the structural disorder of the alkali at @xmath500.5 , which extends to the coo@xmath1 substructure , broadens the bands and hides small distinctions.@xcite this observation suggests that carrying out spectroscopic studies of both systems in the insulating phase at @xmath4=0.5 should be an excellent way to identify and characterize more precisely the effects of the different alkali cations .",
