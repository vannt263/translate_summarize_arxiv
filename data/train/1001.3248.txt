    "it is well known that the anti - wick ( or klauder - berezin - toeplitz ) quantization ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) of the complex plane equipped with the lebesgue measure yields both canonical commutation rule , @xmath0=i\\hbar \\ , { \\mathbb i}$ ] , and quantum spectrum of the harmonic oscillator ( namely @xmath1 up to the addition of @xmath2 ) . the aim of this paper is to prove that these two issues are not necessarily coupled : there exists a discrete family of separable hilbert subspaces @xmath3 , @xmath4 , in @xmath5 , including the `` canonical '' subspace fock - bargmann , and in each element in this family there exists an overcomplete set of states resolving the unity and producing , with the exception of the fock - bargmann case , -canonical commutation relation the same quantum spectrum of the harmonic oscillator up to the addition of the constant @xmath6 .",
    "each @xmath3 is the closure of the linear span of complex hermite polynomials @xcite weighted by a gaussian , @xmath7 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ secwick ]",
    "we recall some well - known facts about the anti - wick or standard coherent state quantization and make comparison with the canonical quantization .",
    "then , in section [ seccsquant ] , we present a general construction of coherent states ( cs ) and we describe the corresponding cs quantization . in the following sections , the procedure is worked out with coherent states based on complex and real hermite polynomials .",
    "the complex hermite polynomials are defined in section [ seccomherm ] and the corresponding quantization of the complex plane is implemented in section [ sechermquant ] .",
    "its remarkable feature is the appearance of a new commutation rule for the lowering and raising operators , and so for the position and momentum operator , where is involved an extra term proportional to the projector on the ground state .",
    "notwithstanding , we obtain for the energy spectrum of the cs quantized harmonic oscillator the same as for the usual one up to addition of a constant defined by the class of considered complex hermite polynomials . we examine in section [ susy ] a possible connection of our results with supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "some statistical aspects of the complex hermite polynomial coherent states and the corresponding quantization are examined in section [ secstat ] . in the same vein , we explore in section [ secrealmerm ] the quantization of the real line with coherent states in finite dimensional hilbert spaces constructed with real hermite polynomials and we study the resulting localization properties .",
    "it turns out that for a given dimension the position operator is the same as the position operator derived from the corresponding finite dimensional approximation of the usual quantum mechanics .",

    "the anti - wick quantization , to which we prefer the name of coherent state ( cs ) quantization , consists in starting from the plane @xmath8 , where we put @xmath9 for convenience , equipped with its lebesgue measure @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and viewed as the phase space for the motion of a particle on the line . in the hilbert space @xmath12 of all complex - valued functions on the complex plane which are square - integrable with respect to this measure",

    "@xcite we retain here two features , namely normalization and unity resolution : @xmath21 cs quantization means that a classical observable @xmath22 , that is a ( usually supposed smooth ) function of phase space variables @xmath23 or equivalently of @xmath24 , is transformed through the operator integral @xmath25 into an operator @xmath26 acting on the hilbert space @xmath17 .",

    "let us now cs quantize the classical harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath47 : @xmath48 we see with this elementary example that the cs quantization does not fit exactly with the `` canonical '' one , which consists in just replacing @xmath40 by @xmath44 and @xmath41 by @xmath45 in the expressions of the observables @xmath49 and next proceeding with a symmetrization in order to comply with self - adjointness .",
