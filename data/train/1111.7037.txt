    "the centaurs are a class of small objects wandering around the realm of the giant planets on unstable orbits .",
    "typically , these objects have a semi - major axis of several tens of astronomical units ( au ) and perihelion ( @xmath2)in among the giant planets . from recent dynamical studies",
    "it is believed that the centaurs originate from the kuiper belt ( kb ) or scattered disc ( sd ) and form the bridge between these trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) and the jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) .",
    "this conclusion was motivated by dynamical studies demonstrating that tnos regularly evolve onto centaur orbits ( tiscareno & malhotra , 2003 ; emelyanenko et al .",
    "2005 ; di sisto & brunini , 2007 ) and even all the way down to jfcs ( levison & duncan , 1997 ) .",
    "one common element among all three studies is that the inclination ( @xmath3 ) of the centaurs tended to remain low : tiscareno & malhotra ( 2003 ) report a characteristic time - weighted mean centaur inclination of 16@xmath0 , while emelyanenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and di sisto & brunini ( 2007 ) find a comparable value .",
    "none of these studies recorded any centaurs with @xmath4 .",
    "is this upper value in agreement with an origin in the tno region ?",
    "brown ( 2001 ) computes the de - biased inclination distribution for tnos and suggests the functional form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "if the centaurs originate from the tno region then they should roughly retain the same inclination distribution .",
    "we can then compute the probability of finding a centaur with @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 , because it is just the complementary cumulative inclination distribution of the centaur population . using the nominal value for @xmath9 results in a probability @xmath10 . from this low value",
    "it is unsurprising that the above - mentioned studies did not record any centaurs with @xmath4 .",
    "it appears that for a centaur to obtain an even higher inclination , an external agent is needed .",
    "+ given the very low probability for a centaur originating from the tno region to reach an inclination above 60@xmath0 it is therefore surprising that to date there are 13 centaurs with inclinations @xmath4 , with six of them on retrograde orbits .",
    "the only known reservoir of small bodies that has many objects on high - inclination orbits is the oort cloud ( e.g. dones et al . , 2004 ) ,",
    "and thus it is probable that these high - inclination centaurs originate from the oort cloud and mimic its inclination distribution .",
    "if , instead , these high - inclination and retrograde centaurs had originated from the tno region , we should have detected tens of thousands of low - inclination centaurs for every retrograde one .",
    "this is not the case and thus the presence of the high - inclination centaurs indicates there is an alternative source .",
    "+ several studies ( levison , 1996 ; wiegert & tremaine , 1999 ; levison et al . , 2006 ) have demonstrated that it is possible for jupiter and saturn to extract objects from the oort cloud , and decrease these planetesimals semi - major axis ( @xmath11 ) to several tens of au .",
    "this works as follows : an oort cloud object that passes through perihelion among the giant planets may experience an increase or reduction in its semi - major axis , depending on the closest approach distance to the planets and the latter s phasing at perihelion .",
    "this process repeats itself at roughly constant perihelion distance with random phasing .",
    "eventually , a small number of objects will have their semi - major axis reduced sufficiently to become a centaur .",
    "thus , it is viable that the high - inclination and retrograde centaurs with @xmath12  au were either extracted and pulled in solely by jupiter and saturn , or they could have been decoupled by uranus and neptune and subsequently passed to saturn and jupiter who then pulled them all the way down to short semi - major axis .",
    "however , there are three objects that require further attention because all of these have @xmath13  au and @xmath14 .",
    "they are beyond of the gravitational control of saturn and thus fall into the domain of uranus and neptune .",

    "there is a potential fourth candidate , 2007 bp102 , with semi - major axis @xmath16  au , @xmath17  au and @xmath18 , but its observational arc is short and it is probably lost .",

    ", ( 2009 ) who suggested two scenaria for its origin : either it is at the extreme end of the inclination distribution of tnos that have become centaurs , or it points to a currently unobserved reservoir .",
    "gladman et al . ( 2009 ) rule out the first scenario based on simulation data from duncan & levison ( 1997 ) , who conclude that even though it is possible to obtain centaurs with @xmath20 , these are usually tied to jupiter .",

    "( 2005 ) and di sisto & brunini ( 2007 ) reported not witnessing any centaur having an inclination above 60@xmath0 .",
    "+ a second mechanism gladman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest is to extract the objects from the oort cloud as their perihelia drift sunward under the influence of the galactic tide .",
    "gladman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) correctly assess that this extraction is a difficult process because the semi - major axis needs to be reduced from over 1000  au to below 100  au while keeping @xmath21  au at all times .",
    "in other words , the extraction needs to be performed by uranus and neptune alone , without the help of saturn .",
    "gladman et al . ( 2009 ) report not having come across this mechanism in the literature and thus rule it out .",
    "they suggest instead that an unobserved population of nearly - isotropic objects resides not too far beyond neptune and some of these objects have their perihelia decreased sufficiently by external factors that neptune extracts them from this reservoir .",
    "unfortunately , there is no observational evidence supporting this claim ( schwamb et al .",
    ", 2010 ) . here",
    ", we show that these high - inclination , high - perihelion ( hihq ) centaurs most likely originate from the oort cloud and are decoupled and pulled down only by uranus and neptune .",
    "in other words , there is only one dynamical pathway for high - inclination centaurs with @xmath21  au rather than the two mentioned above for objects with @xmath22  au .",
    "we demonstrate that the oort cloud will only dominate as a source once the inclination is above a certain value where contribution from the tno region becomes unimportant .",
    "+   our study has a few similarities with kaib et al .",
    "they investigated the origin of the centaur 2006 sq372 , an object with heliocentric @xmath23 . through numerical simulations",
    "they compare the production rates of objects like sq372 from both the scattered disc and the oort cloud and conclude that sq372 most likely originated from the inner oort cloud ( @xmath24  au ) rather than the scattered disc .",
    "additionally , they state that the oort cloud most likely dominates the production of centaurs with large semi - major axis ( @xmath25  au ) , irrespective of inclination .",
    "this was also reported in elemyanenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . +    before we continue , we want to point out that there is no universally - accepted definition of what a centaur is in terms of its orbital properties .",
    "the minor planet centre ( mpc ) defines centaurs as having a perihelion distance beyond the orbit of jupiter and a semi - major axis shorter than that of neptune ; this classification was also adopted by gladman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , but they added the additional constraint that @xmath26  au .",
    "however , the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) classification requires that the semi - major axis is between those of jupiter and neptune .",
    "objects that have @xmath2 in the region of the giant planets but semi - major axis larger than that of neptune are classified as ` scattering disc ' objects by gladman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . while this nomenclature may make sense based on dynamical considerations , we find that the semi - major axis restriction makes classification more complicated because of the objects inherent increased mobility in @xmath11 versus @xmath2 for very eccentric orbits .",
    "thus , for this study , we adopt the traditional definition that a centaur is a planetesimal whose perihelion distance is in between the orbits of jupiter and neptune i.e. @xmath27 , without a restriction on semi - major axis .",
    "this definition is also used by tiscareno & malhotra ( 2003 ) , emelyanenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and di sisto & brunini ( 2007 ) .",

    "we present the results from these simulations . in section 4",
    "we derive how many hihq centaurs with absolute magnitude @xmath1 we expect to exist and in the last section we draw our conclusions .",
    "in order to test whether the hihq centaurs originate from the oort cloud or the scattered disc , we performed a large number of numerical simulations divided into several categories .",
    "specifically , we ran a total of four sets of simulations : two pertaining to the evolution of the tno region and two dealing with the oort cloud .",
    "+ the first set of simulations come from lykawka et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and were used to determine whether or not the tno region could be the dominant source of the hihq centaurs .",
    "these simulations were integrated using the mercury package ( chambers , 1999 ) and lasted for 4  gyr with the giant planets on their current orbits .",

    "the results of these simulations shall be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "briefly , these simulations consist of 5 separate simulations starting with 5000 test particles each and the giant planets on in a more compact configuration .",
    "the planets are then evolved through the ` jumping jupiter ' evolution of brasser et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using the interpolation method of petit et al .",

    "the simulations were continued for 10  myr to allow the planets to reach their current orbits adiabatically and we refer to morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for a more detailed description of this process .",
    "once the planets had reached their current orbits , we spread all simulations over ten cpus to hasten the evolution .",
    "we continued the simulations to 500  myr , 2  gyr , 3  gyr and 4  gyr , cloning the remaining test particles tenfold at each of these times except at 4  gyr .",

    "we believe this procedure is justified because the phases of the planetesimals with respect to the galactic tide are essentially random when the sun s birth cluster evaporates . the oort cloud that formed in these simulations has an inner edge at approximately 500  au and",

    "these simulations allowed us determine which objects potentially reached the giant planets and which ones stayed in the inner oort cloud for the age of the solar system .",
    "the time step was 50  yr . on average , 7% of all the planetesimals in the inner oort cloud came closer to the sun than 38  au in 4  gyr .",

    "+ a last , fourth set of simulations were similar to the third set apart from the fact that the classical oort cloud was used i.e. the oort cloud that was formed in the current galactic environment rather than during the sun s birth cluster ( e.g. dones et al .",

    "however this reservoir is modelled with the third set of simulations reported above and here we are only interested in production from the outer oort cloud ( @xmath41  au ) , most of which has formed in less than 100  myr .",

    "once again we used scatr with the same parameters as above .",
    "in this section the results from our numerical simulations are presented .",
    "+      the probability of finding a hihq centaur is essentially given by the product of the fraction of particles that ever enter the hihq centaur phase multiplied by particle s fractional lifetime in the hihq centaur state .",
    "for tno simulations the data were averaged over the last 500  myr while for the oort cloud simulations the data were averaged over the last 1  gyr .",
    "output from simulations within each set were combined together to improve statistics .",
    "the typical number of data points ( number of particles at each output multiplied by the number of outputs ) was in the millions . +    using the tno simulations from lykawka et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( set 1 ) and the ones from set 2 , we computed the probability of a body being in the hihq centaur state .",
    "the probability for hihq centaur production turned out to be @xmath42 for objects with",
    "@xmath43 $ ]  au , @xmath44  au and @xmath45 .",
    "this value is almost the same for both sets of simulations ( 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the similar order of probabilities for hihq centaurs with @xmath46 even for different early solar system architectures and evolution of the planets suggests the results are generally robust for neptune - encountering small bodies .",
    "hence the details of the simulations ( migration versus no migration ) and the type of integrator that was being used ( mercury versus swift rmvs3 ) seem to play a minor role in determining the intrinsic probabilities for a typical tno source . from the simulations of both the inner and classical oort cloud ( 3 and 4 ) we also obtained a probability of @xmath47 for an oort cloud object to obtain a hihq centaur with @xmath48 .",
    "this agreement in the production probability between objects from the inner and classical oort cloud suggests the probability estimate is robust .",
    "these results would suggest that at 65@xmath49 inclination both reservoirs contribute approximately equally , and that we need to go to higher inclinations to determine whether or not one source dominates over the other .",
    "in other words , we need to determine if there is a critical inclination .",
    "+     in principle the probability of finding a hihq centaur from the tno region is the product of the probability that a tno becomes a centaur with @xmath43 $ ]  au and @xmath44  au ( approximately 1% ) , and the complementary cumulative inclination distribution , @xmath50 .",
    "a similar argument applies to oort cloud objects .",
    "figure  [ hihqp ] plots the probability of obtaining a hihq centaur from both the tno region and the oort cloud as a function of inclination .",
    "the change of slope in the tno profile at 60@xmath49 is caused by a sample of centaurs in resonance with neptune which only became unstable towards the end of the simulation .",
    "however , it does not severely affect the general outcome since all the objects we consider in this study have higher inclinations .",
    "the shaded region takes into account the observed population ratio between the oort cloud and scattered disc , which appears to be between 100 to 1000 ( duncan & levison , 1997 ) .",
    "as one can see , if this population ratio is representative of the reality then the oort cloud should dominate centaur population production with @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath44 when @xmath52 , but it could be at a much lower inclination",
    ". however , the oort cloud to scattered disc population ratio is still an open problem and thus the above results should only be used as indicative rather than absolute .",
    "instead we focus on the first curve , which meets the oort cloud probability at a critical inclination @xmath53 .",
    "thus it is almost certain that hihq centaur production is dominated by the oort cloud when the inclination @xmath54 , irrespective of the oort cloud to scattered disc population ratio .",
    "+    in this study we peg the value of the critical inclination at 70@xmath0 and we assume that centaurs with higher inclinations are exclusively provided by the oort cloud . this assumption is justified given the results of fig .",
    "[ hihqp ] above .",
    "all three of the objects in our sample have an inclination @xmath55 and approximately 1 in @xmath56 oort cloud objects is in the hihq centaur state at any time .",
    "+      the evolution of oort cloud objects towards the hihq centaur state is straightforward .",
    "two examples are given in fig.[evo ] .",

    "the horizontal lines indicate the positions of the giant planets , which are indicated by the labels .",
    "the bottom panels depict the evolution of the inclination of these two objects .",
    "the inclinations of the three known objects are indicated by the horizontal lines .",
    "+    as one can see from the top panels , the perihelion distance of the object decreases on gyr time scales .",
    "once it is in the vicinity of neptune , encounters with this planet reduce the semi - major axis of the object on a time scale of several hundred myr .",
    "this lowering of the semi - major axis should occur faster than the time it takes for the galactic tide to decrease the perihelion past uranus down to saturn .",
    "the galactic tide causes perturbations that decrease the perihelion according to @xmath57 ( duncan et al . , 1987 ) .",
    "this scaling suggests that oort cloud objects with an initial semi - major axis longer than some maximum value , @xmath58 , pass by uranus and neptune too quickly for these planets to have the time to extract them from the cloud . from our simulations we found @xmath59  au , with a median initial semi - major axis of @xmath60  au if the main source is the inner cloud , or @xmath61  au if the classical cloud dominates .",
    "these values are in rough agreement with those reported in kaib et al .",
    "the discontinuity in @xmath2 in the plots at 1.4  gyr is caused by a close stellar passage and has no bearing on the overall outcome of our simulations .",
    "+ for a long time the perihelion of both objects is pinned to uranus with short - period oscillations superimposed on it caused by the kozai mechanism ( kozai , 1962 ) , similar to the current evolution of the three known objects .",
    "the two fictitious objects depicted above stay in the hihq centaur state for about 1  gyr .",
    "we find that , on average , an oort cloud object resides in the hihq centaur phase for 200  myr , which was obtained by measuring the total time each hihq centaur resided in this phase and dividing by the total simulation time or lifetime of the particle .",
    "this typical residence time is consistent with that found by gladman et al .",

    "[ evo ] we chose these longer - lived cases for illustrative purpose only .",
    "a natural question to ask is what are the long - term inclination and perihelion distributions of these objects .",

    "the steady - state inclination and perihelion distributions are depicted in fig .",

    "in fact , all three objects are found in the region where the model predicts most objects should be .",
    "+ now that we have shown the mechanism behind the production of hihq centaurs from the oort cloud , and what the expected perihelion and inclination distribution of these objects are , we proceed to estimate how many hihq centaurs there could be .",
    "we can use the dynamics of the oort cloud to estimate how many hihq centaurs we would expect .",
    "brasser ( 2008 ) suggested that the oort cloud formed in two stages : the first state would occur while the sun was in its birth cluster , at the time just after the formation of jupiter and saturn , when the gas from the primordial solar nebula was still present . the second stage would occur some 600  myr later , at the time of a dynamical instability of the giant planets , which is thought to have coincided with the late heavy bombardment of the terrestrial planets ( tsiganis et al .",
    ", 2005 ; gomes et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "thus the oort cloud is a mixture of bodies from two sources and as we demonstrated above , the hihq centaurs can originate from both the inner and classical cloud .",

    "the error values correspond to 95% confidence levels",
    ". the latter value could be problematic because the low formation efficiency of brasser et al .",

    "the nominal number of hihq centaurs with @xmath1 is expected to range from 1 to 200 .",
    "the former value is too low since more objects have already been found and the sample is far from being observationally complete .",
    "the highest value is also problematic for reasons discussed earlier : too much mass had to exist in the primordial disc and be deposited in the inner oort cloud .",
    "thus , we believe that the current number of hihq centaurs is probably in between these two extremes . in any case",
    "the direct link between the hihq centaurs and the oort cloud could be used to constrain oort cloud formation models and possibly infer the mass and size of the primordial solar nebula once more hihq centaur objects are discovered .",
    "we have analysed the origin of several centaurs with inclinations above 70@xmath0 , perihelia between 15  au and 30  au and semi - major axes shorter than 100  au .",
    "we call this population the high - inclination , high - perihelion centaurs ( hihq centaurs )",
    ". the high inclination of these objects , including one retrograde , suggests an origin from the oort cloud , where the galactic tide is capable of substantially modifying the original inclination . we find that for inclinations higher than 70@xmath0 the oort cloud dominates as a source over the regular tno region , which consists of the kuiper belt and scattered disc , although this transition could occur at a much lower inclination , depending on the oort cloud to scattered disc population ratio .",
    "the steady - state probability of any oort cloud object residing on a hihq centaur orbit is @xmath75 .",
    "based on this probability , and using the typical formation efficiency of the oort cloud and the expected number of objects to reside in the source region , we predict there are between 1 and 200 hihq centaurs with @xmath1 . apart from sedna and new comets , we propose that the hihq centaurs are the only directly - visible objects that can be used to constrain the number of oort cloud objects once they are observationally complete .",
