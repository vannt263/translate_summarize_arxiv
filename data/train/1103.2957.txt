    "the standard way of capturing the effects of cooling by a given species is via the _ cooling function _ , which gives the energy lost per second at a specified temperature .",

    "this behaviour is a direct consequence of the rhf model , which upon dissociation restricts molecular fragments to be spin - singlets ( see e.g. lodi & tennyson  2010 ) .",

    "in fact , the ccsd(t ) module in molpro does not converge for @xmath72 greater than about 6  a@xmath64 ( using the default settings )",
    ". this may be slightly suprising because , as lih has only 2 valence electron , method such as ccsd(t ) are formally equivalent to full configuration interaction ( fci ) in the valence space and should therefore be quite accurate .",
    "it is the non - linearity of the equations to be solved , together with the poor starting guess , that result in these numerical problems .",

    "this method was therefore used for further calculations . with respect to the fci energies",
    "the ic - acpf method predicts a dissociation energy too low by about 6.0  @xmath35 .",

    "the energy and dipole curves were computed for 300 uniformely - spaced grid points for @xmath77  a@xmath64 to @xmath78  a@xmath64 with spacing @xmath79 a@xmath64 .",
    "the final energy values were obtained for each grid point by basis - set extrapolation of the @xmath68 t , q and 5 values ; following common practice ( see , e.g. , lodi & tennyson  2010 ) the cas - scf energies were extrapolated using the functional form @xmath80 while the differences between ic - acpf and cas - scf energies were extrapolated using @xmath81 .",
    "a minor complication arose because , for all basis sets employed , the cas - scf energies experience a discontinuity jump of about 6  @xmath35 around @xmath82  a@xmath64 if rhf orbitals are used as starting guess ; as a result the ic - acpf energies also experience a discontinuity jump of about 1.2  @xmath35 .",
    "this problem is undoubtedly another consequence of the poor rhf starting guess ; it was circumvented by starting calculations at small bond lengths and then concatenating subsequent calculations for increasing @xmath72 so that the cas - scf orbitals from the preceeding geometry were used as starting guess .",
