    "we can see that the initial @xmath36 signal pulse is gone and has been taken over by a @xmath36 control pulse propagating away at the speed of light .",
    "the second step starts at @xmath41 as a @xmath36 control pulse comes in and collides with the information imprint left by the signal pulse . during the collision , which takes place between times @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,",
    "the initial signal pulse is retrieved and redeposited at @xmath44 , effectively pushing the imprint farther into the medium . here again , during the interaction the total pulse area is conserved and equal to @xmath36 .",

    "as was done in @xcite we will define the total pulse area as @xmath45 and we have that @xmath46 for the two first - order solutions .",

    "[ pulses ] where the two steps are separated by an ellipsis .",
    "we will label the parameters pertaining to different steps of the sequence of pulses by the letters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for the first step , in the limit @xmath49 we have a sit - like signal pulse propagating , driving population from the ground state @xmath50 into the excited state @xmath51 and coherently driving it back , thus obtaining the characteristic @xmath36 pulse shaped as an hyperbolic secant .",
    "as the control pulse is only zero in the limit of infinite negative time , some of the excited population is coherently driven into the ground state @xmath52 , thus amplifying the seed of the control pulse and depleting the signal pulse . during this transfer",
    "the signal pulse encodes its information into the ground - state elements @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 of the density matrix .",
    "this encoding we refer to as an imprint .",
    "after the storage process is over we get a @xmath36 control pulse propagating away at the speed of light as it is decoupled from the medium .",
    "both signal and control pulses have a duration of @xmath56 , and they are time - matched . therefore the ratio between their rabi frequencies is independent of time and given by : @xmath57 where the absorption coefficient is given by @xmath58 , since we are neglecting the effects of doppler broadening , and @xmath59 is the location of the imprint .",
    "this relation shows us how we should map the analytical solution to appropriate initial conditions for the numerical computation .",
    "it is easy to see that , by integrating the previous equation with respect to @xmath60 and by considering that our medium starts at @xmath61 , we can get @xmath59 in terms of the pulse areas : @xmath62    for the second step we start with a @xmath36-control pulse of duration @xmath63 decoupled from the medium .",
    "when this control pulse collides with the imprint , the signal pulse is retrieved which , upon interaction with the medium , stores its information in a displaced location .",
    "when the re - encoding has taken place , the control pulse recovers its original pulse area of @xmath36 and propagates away at the speed of light .",
    "the end result is the displacement of the imprint farther into the medium with a @xmath2-phase shift for @xmath55 if @xmath64 .",
    "the displacement is controlled by the phase - lag parameter defined as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the new location of the imprint .",
    "note that the addition of doppler broadening would affect the definition of the absorption coefficient and thus change the group velocity of the pulses in the medium as was shown in @xcite , but the storage procedure would carry through .",

    "the imprint was generated by the pulse sequence depicted in fig .",
    "[ pulses ] , the snapshots were taken at times @xmath67 for the initial imprint and @xmath68 for the displaced one . ]",
    "having reviewed the main results of the analytical solution we now address the question of how these ideas can be used for storage and retrieval of optical pulses .",
    "the first step is to consider media of finite length and use eq .   to determine the pulses input areas in order to store the signal pulse at the desired location .",
    "this location must be chosen so that most of the imprint fits inside the medium for optimal information storage .",
    "signal pulse storage takes place as described by the dynamics of the first step in the sequence of pulses , where the control pulse overtakes the signal pulse .",
    "now that we have the information stored inside the medium we want to be able to retrieve it .",
    "to do this we inject a second control pulse of area @xmath36 and duration such that according to eq .",
    "the imprint is pushed outside the medium .",
    "when the control pulse collides with the imprint it retrieves the signal pulse that was stored in the medium , as described by the second step in the sequence . according to the previous results , the signal pulse travels until it reaches the location where the imprint is supposed to be re - encoded .",
    "however , this never takes place because the location lies outside the medium .",
    "thus by frustrating the signal pulse re - storage by means of the end face of the medium we are able to retrieve it . of course this retrieval can be done in any number of steps , displacing the imprint closer to the end face before retrieving it .",
    "the analytical solution is fairly restrictive because it assumes an infinite medium and @xmath36 pulses with asymptotic hyperbolic secant shape with infinitely long tails .",
    "additionally , we have neglected the effects of homogeneous relaxation phenomena and the atom - field coupling parameters were kept equal . since we are considering the propagation of pulses in an ultra - cold atomic system , we can safely omit the effects of collisional and doppler broadening , but spontaneous emission @xmath4 is still present and could have a noticeable effect .",
    "we modify the von neumann equation to account for this :    @xmath69    and for the field :    @xmath70    [ meqsn ]    the time and length scales are respectively defined in terms of the duration and absorption coefficient associated with the first signal pulse .",
    "we abandon the idealized conditions of infinitely long media and pulses by considering a medium ten absorption lengths long ( unless otherwise noted ) and setting the rabi frequencies to zero when @xmath71 . for each simulation",
    "we will consider three cases : hyperbolic - secant - shaped pulses with no decay channels , gaussian - shaped pulses with no decay channels , and hyperbolic - secant shaped pulses with decay channels .",
    "this allows the effects of shape and homogeneous broadening to be studied separately .",
    "the shape of the pulses we will use throughout are :    @xmath72    for the simulations , we consider a sample of @xmath73rb using the @xmath74 line and consider a pulse duration such that @xmath75 , so @xmath76 .",
    "for the atom - field coupling parameters we have that @xmath77 @xcite . from these estimates",
    "we clearly see that the approximations made in order to get the analytical solution were justified .",
    "nonetheless we need to study their effects to determine whether these pulse dynamics are an experimentally realizable scenario . for simplicity",
    "the detuning is taken to be zero .",
    "another thing worth noting is that we can not choose an arbitrary pulse duration because we need to be able to resolve the hyperfine splitting of the ground state but not of the excited state in order to have a @xmath0-system . for the case of rb",
    "we have the condition that @xmath78 .",
    "we could have considered cs atoms to attain smaller values for @xmath79 by using shorter pulses , down to @xmath80 @xcite . or if we want to use longer pulses , we could use k but with the compromise of a larger value for @xmath81(@xmath82 ) @xcite .",
    "note that the important quantity is @xmath79 and not just @xmath4 , because what matters here is how long the spontaneous decay time is with respect to the interaction time between the pulses and the atomic system .",
    "first , we consider how the shape and finiteness of the pulses , as well as the effects of homogeneous relaxation , affect the location of the first imprint .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ figx1 ] . for the dependence on the control pulse area , fig .",
    "[ figx1](a ) , we notice that the hyperbolic secant - shaped pulse completely overlaps the curve given by the theory .",
    "we see that the effect of spontaneous emission is to lower the curve very slightly while maintaining the same shape .",
    "the gaussian - shaped pulse clearly deviates from the expected behavior , but keeps a predictable trend and in the grand scheme has the same dependence , i.e. , the location of the imprint increases when the control pulse area decreases .",
    "the effects of spontaneous emission on the gaussian - shaped pulse curve are analogous to those of the hyperbolic secant - shaped pulse , namely , to lower the curve while keeping the same type of dependence ( the data for this case are not presented for the sake of clarity in the figures ) .",
    "the analytical solution sets the total pulse area of each step of the process equal to @xmath36 , but we are free to change that in the simulations . from an experimental point of view , it is important to know this dependence , since it might be difficult to control the area of the pulses with much precision . setting the ratio of the signal to control pulse area such that eq .",
    "predicts an imprint location of @xmath83 , we vary the total pulse area [ see fig .",
    "[ figx1](b ) ] .",
    "we find that for all three cases there appears to be a linear dependence with similar positive slope , @xmath84 for the hyperbolic secant shaped- and @xmath85 for the gaussian - shaped pulses . here",
    "we only consider small variations inherent to any realistic experimental scenario and so this behavior can not be extrapolated to arbitrarily large and small pulse areas . in particular ,",
    "if we consider areas smaller than @xmath2 then the pulses are not strong enough to promote the necessary population transfer for the initial sit propagation and then the transfer from signal to control pulses . for pulse areas larger than @xmath86",
    "we would get pulse breakup and thus a different kind of interaction .",
    "another restriction from the solution is that signal and control pulses are time matched ( this might not be ideal for an experiment because one would have to change the duration of the control pulses between consecutive steps ) . relaxing this condition",
    "we find a behavior similar to the previous case [ see fig .",
    "[ figx1](c ) ] : the imprint location increases with the duration of the control pulse .",
    "once again all three cases seem to have similar positive slopes , @xmath87 for the hyperbolic secants and @xmath88 for the gaussian .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the shape of the imprint is the same as the one predicted theoretically ( fig .  [ density ] ) for the two cases where the pulses are hyperbolic secants , but for the gaussian - shaped pulse it is approximately @xmath89 times wider .",
    "this is a consequence of the reshaping of the gaussian pulse to a corresponding hyperbolic - secant - shaped pulse with slightly different time duration .",
    "now that we know we can imprint the information of the signal pulse into the atomic system given non - idealized conditions , we have to study the next step of the pulse sequence : the displacement of the imprint . to do this , we select the initial pulse area of the control pulse for each case using the results from the previous section , so that the initial imprint is made at @xmath90 combined with a @xmath36 signal pulse",
    ". then we vary the control pulse duration and find the new position of the imprint .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ figdel](a ) .",
    "as predicted by the theory , the closer @xmath63 is to @xmath56 , the more the imprint is displaced . additionally , the new imprint is identical to the initial one except for a @xmath2 phase shift when the control pulse duration is smaller than the signal pulse .",
    "we also notice that the different parameters affect the displacement in a similar way regarding the location of the initial imprint .",
    "the hyperbolic - secant - shaped pulse closely follows the behavior dictated by eq .  , while the addition of decay causes a decrease in the displacement .",
    "however , the gaussian - shaped pulse causes a displacement that is typically larger than that given by the analytical solution ( here again the effects of spontaneous emission for the gaussian - shaped pulse are analogous to those of the hyperbolic - secant - shaped pulse ) .",
    "the biggest difference from the theoretical prediction is that there is an upper limit in how much the imprint can be moved ( this is true for all three cases ) .",
    "this will define how close the imprint must be to the end face so that the signal pulse can be retrieved .",
    "another feature is that if we consider the case @xmath91 we get similar results but the imprint does not present the @xmath2 phase shift",
    ". this might be desirable if we want the retrieved signal pulse to have the same phase as the original ( as we will see in the next section ) , but one must be careful because homogeneous relaxation will affect the displacement even more if the pulses interact with the medium for a longer time .",
    "we also explore the dependence of the displacement with respect to the control pulse area @xmath92 as noted before , a parameter not accessible from the analytical solution . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figdel](b ) , the results are quite surprising .",
    "we find that the displacement increases as we decrease the pulse area , until it reaches a maximum ( these are hidden by the plateaus which represent that the imprint has been pushed outside the medium ) and then starts decreasing again .",
    "for all three cases , the `` optimal '' pulse area is actually less than the @xmath36 predicted by the theory , and not only do we have maxima for these smaller areas but also the displacement can be much greater than the one predicted in eq .  .",
    "there is also some dependence on the first imprint location , and there are two possible tendencies as shown in fig .",
    "[ figdel](c ) .",
    "the first is an increase in the displacement as we increase @xmath59 until it reaches a steady value .",
    "this behavior is obtained when there are no decay channels and is due to the finiteness of the medium which cuts off part of the information deposited by the signal pulse , so the closer we get to the center of the medium the more room there is for the imprint to be made . as for the gaussian - shaped pulse , it is affected the most because the imprint is wider .",
    "when we consider spontaneous emission , another process takes over : the further into the medium the first imprint is made , the less it will be displaced by the second control pulse . this can be understood by the fact that the longer it takes to deposit the information of the signal pulse , the longer the decay is effective , provoking some information loss and this ultimately leads to less displacement .",
    "one of the most important effects of the boundaries in the medium is to cut off the pulse transfer process of the analytical solution , thus providing a way to retrieve the initial signal pulse . to quantify the accuracy of the retrieval process we define the retrieval efficiency as @xmath93 clearly",
    "this quantity only gives information about the output signal pulse intensity but does not take into account any possible reshaping of the pulse . to account for this",
    "we calculate the correlation coefficient @xmath94 between the input and output signal pulses .",
    "this is particularly important for the gaussian - shaped pulses which are reshaped into hyperbolic secants as they propagate through the medium .",
    "this has already been noted in the case of atomic vapors at room temperature @xcite . from the previous sections it should be clear that the retrieval process can take place in any number of steps , but for the sake of clarity we will treat only two cases : two- and three - step retrieval .",
    "additionally , we will only consider control pulses of areas equal to @xmath36 and of duration times equal to or smaller than that of the initial signal pulse for the displacement and retrieval steps .",
    ".[tab ] retrieval efficiency and correlation coefficient for one- and two - step processes . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us first consider the one - step process .",
    "here we want to make the imprint somewhere in the medium such that it can be retrieved without having to move it closer to the boundary ( this limit is set by the case where we consider homogeneous relaxation ) . for this",
    "we consider the necessary pulse areas for each case so that the initial imprint is made at @xmath95 , and for the second step we consider a control pulse with the same duration as the signal pulse , giving us the maximum displacement .",
    "for the two - step process we will make the initial imprint at @xmath83 , then tailor the time duration of the following control pulse so that we displace the imprint by @xmath96 and finally push the imprint outside the medium by means of another control pulse of duration equal to the original signal pulse .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab ] .",
    "we notice that , when no decay is present , the efficiency is high ( larger than 90% ) but as soon as homogeneous relaxation is added it drops to 65% for one - step and 66% for two - step processes . as for the correlation coefficient , it is fairly close to unity in all cases , indicating that the shape of the pulse is mostly preserved throughout the storage and retrieval procedure .",
    "the gaussian - shaped pulses are the ones that have the lowest @xmath94 values as could have been expected because of the reshaping during propagation . in any case , we are able to retrieve a good portion of the initial signal pulse and see that this does not depend on the number of steps involved . in the one - step case ,",
    "the retrieved signal pulse has a @xmath2 phase shift with respect to the original .",
    "the correct phase can be obtained by inverting the initial storing control pulse or by increasing the duration of the second control pulse as discussed in sec .",
    "[ secdis ] . in the two - step process",
    ", the signal pulse comes out with the same phase due to the @xmath2-phase shift in the displacement step .",
    "in this report we have shown that previously predicted memory manipulation by means of idealized atomic pulse dynamics is plausible even in non - idealized conditions .",
    "the shape of the pulse and the effects of spontaneous emission have an impact on the quantitative results but the storage and retrieval of the signal pulse are achieved in all cases .",
    "we have quantified the deviations in each case and even shown some features that could add more control to the process and lift some restrictions .",
    "the length of the medium has no effect on the memory manipulation , but should be chosen so that most of the information can be deposited into the medium",
    ". this may no longer be true if we consider the reflection of the pulses at the end face .",
    "another aspect that we noticed throughout this work , and that has been noted elsewhere , is the stability against the total pulse area . when considering pulses of different area than @xmath36 , be it bigger or smaller , the pulses are reshaped as they propagate in an effort to obtain a @xmath36 total area",
    "this is completely analogous to the predictions of the area theorem @xcite for a homogeneously broadened two - level atom .",
    "additionally , we can ask which is the appropriate extension of the total pulse area for higher order solutions , particularly when the two first- order solutions overlap .",
    "we can also think of extending this analysis to more complicated pulse sequences .",
    "this would be the same as simulating higher - order solutions of the maxwell - bloch equations obtained by further applications of the nonlinear superposition rule .",
    "this could possibly pave the way for making multiple imprints belonging to different signal pulses and then manipulating them by means of control pulses .",
