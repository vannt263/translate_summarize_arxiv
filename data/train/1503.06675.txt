    "time - frequency representation ( tfr ) is a well established powerful tool for the analysis of time series signals .",
    "there exist many types of time - frequency ( tf ) analysis methods , e.g. linear ( the short - time fourier transform ) , quadratic ( the wigner - ville distribution ) and wavelet transforms .",
    "the tfr is achieved by formulation often referred as time - frequency distribution ( tfd ) and provides insight into the complex structure of a signal consisting of several components .",
    "these approaches have many useful applications , however the analysis of nonstationary signals are not well presented by these methods .",
    "recently developed empirical mode decomposition ( emd )  @xcite has provided a general method for examining the tfd , and has been applied to all kinds of data .",
    "the emd is an adaptive signal analysis algorithm for the analysis of nonstationary and nonlinear signals ( i.e. signals generated from nonlinear systems ) .",
    "the emd has become an established method for the signal analysis in various applications , e.g. medical studies  @xcite , meteorology  @xcite , geophysical studies  @xcite and image analysis@xcite .",
    "the emd decomposes any given data into a finite number of narrow band intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) which are derived directly from the data , whereas other signal decomposition techniques ( like the fourier , wavelets , etc . )",
    "incorporate predefined fixed basis for signal modeling and analysis .",
    "the ensemble emd ( eemd ) is a noise - assisted data analysis method developed in  @xcite to overcome the timescale separation problem of emd .",
    "the multivariate emd ( memd ) developed in  @xcite is a generalization of the emd for multichannel data analysis .",
    "the compact emd ( cemd ) algorithm is proposed in  @xcite to reduce mode mixing , end effect , and detrend uncertainty present in emd and to reduce computation complexity of eemd as well .",
    "the imfs , generated by emd , are dependent on distribution of local extrema of signal and the type of spline used for upper and lower envelope interpolation .",
    "the traditional emd uses cubic spline for upper and lower envelope interpolation .",
    "the emd algorithm , proposed in  @xcite to reduce mode mixing and detrend uncertainty , uses nonpolynomial cubic spline interpolation to obtain upper and lower envelopes , and have shown in  @xcite that it improves orthogonality among imfs .",
    "the energy preserving property is important for any kind of transformation , and it is obtained by the orthogonal decomposition of signal in various transforms like the fourier , wavelet , fourier - bessel , etc",
    ". the energy preserving property is especially important for the accurate and faithful analysis of three dimensional time - frequency - energy distribution of a signal .",
    "the emd algorithms , proposed in  @xcite , ensure orthogonality or energy preserving property or both in decomposition of signal into imfs and refereed to as energy preserving emd ( epemd ) .    in spite of considerable success of emd ,",
    "all of the emd algorithms are based on empirical , heuristic and ad hoc procedure that make them hard to analyze mathematically , and emd may suffer from mode mixing , detrend uncertainty , aliasing and end effect artefacts  @xcite .",
    "there is a lack of mathematical understanding of the emd algorithms , e.g. imfs dependence on the number of sifting and the stopping criteria , convergence property and stability to noise perturbation . in spite of all these limitations , emd is the widely used nonstationary data analysis method .",
    "therefore , in this paper , emd is used as a reference to establish the validity , reliability and calibration of the proposed method .    since many decades",
    ", there is an understanding in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) that the fourier methods are , directly , not suitable for nonlinear and nonstationary data analysis , and various reasons ( e.g. linearity , periodicity or stationarity ) are provided to support it .",
    "the fourier transform is valid under very general dirichlet conditions ( i.e. signal is absolutely integrable with finite number of maxima and minima , and finite number of finite discontinuities in any finite interval ) thus include nonlinear and nonstationary signals as well .",
    "therefore , in this study , we explore and provide algorithms to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary data by the fourier method termed as the fourier decomposition method ( fdm ) , which generates small number of fourier intrinsic band functions ( fibfs ) .",
    "it is already well established that the fourier method is best tool for spectrum analysis and , in this study , we show that the fourier method is also a best tool for time - frequency analysis and processing of any signal .",
    "the power of the fourier transform can also be realized from the fact that the analytic representation and , hence , the hilbert transform of a signal are , inherently , present in the fourier transform .    in this paper",
    ", we also propose a method , which captures the features of the memd , using a zero - phase filter bank ( zpfb ) approach to construct the multivariate fibfs and residue components .",
    "this multivariate fdm ( mfdm ) algorithm generates matched multivariate fibfs and residue through zero - phase filtering .",
    "thus , we propose an adaptive , data - driven , zpfb based time - frequency analysis method .    for the adaptive data analysis approach ,",
    "the most difficult challenge has been to establish a general adaptive decomposition method of analysis without a priori basis . in this study",
    ", we propose the fdm and mfdm general adaptive data analysis methods that are inspired by the emd methods and their filter bank properties  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii the emd algorithm is briefly presented .",
    "we propose the fourier decomposition method ( fdm ) in section iii .",
    "we propose the zpfb based multivariate fdm algorithm in section iv .",
    "simulation results are presented in section v. finally conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "there are various tools for nonstationary data processing such as the spectrogram ; the wavelet analysis ; the wigner - ville distribution ; evolutionary spectrum  @xcite ; the empirical orthogonal function expansion ( eof ) ( or principal component analysis or singular value decomposition ) ; synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms  @xcite ; the emd , etc .",
    "the emd is a well established signal decomposition method that decomposes nonlinear and nonstationary data into a set of finite band - limited imfs and residue through the sifting process .",
    "the decomposed signal @xmath0 is expressed as the sum of @xmath1 imf components plus the final residue as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 imf and @xmath5 is final residue .",
    "the imfs admit amplitude - frequency modulated ( am - fm ) representation @xcite ( i.e. @xmath6 , with @xmath7 @xmath8 ) and well - behaved hilbert transforms @xcite . for any imf @xmath9 , its hilbert transform @xmath10 is defined as convolution of @xmath9 and @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 and the hilbert transform emphasizes the local properties of @xmath9 .",
    "an analytic signal @xmath13 can be represented by @xmath14 , where @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath16 $ ] are instantaneous amplitude and phase of @xmath9 .",
    "the instantaneous frequency ( if ) of @xmath9 is defined as : @xmath17 .",
    "the physical meaning of if @xmath18 constrains that @xmath19 must be a mono - component function of time .",
    "the bedrosian and nuttall theorems @xcite further impose non - overlapping spectra constraints on the pair [ @xmath20 of a signal @xmath21 .",
    "all imfs must satisfy two basic conditions : ( 1 ) in the complete range of time series , the number of extrema ( i.e. maxima and minima ) and the number of zero crossings are equal or differ at most by one .",
    "( 2 ) at any point of time in the complete range of time series , the average of the values of upper and lower envelopes , obtained by the interpolation of local maxima and the local minima , is zero .",
    "the first condition ensure that imfs are narrow band signals and the second condition is necessary to ensure that the if does not have redundant fluctuations because of asymmetric waveforms  @xcite .",
    "we propose a class of functions , termed as the fourier intrinsic band functions ( fibfs ) , belonging to @xmath22 $ ] , here with the following formal definition .",
    "[ law : box ] the fourier intrinsic band functions ( fibfs ) , @xmath23 $ ] , are functions that satisfy the following conditions : + ( 1 ) the fibfs are zero mean functions , i.e. @xmath24",
    ". + ( 2 ) the fibfs are orthogonal functions , i.e. @xmath25 , for @xmath26 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the fibfs provide analytic fibfs ( afibfs ) with instantaneous frequency ( if ) and amplitude always greater than zero , i.e. @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the afibfs are monocomponent signals and , physically , the if has meaning only for monocomponent signals , i.e. , signal has only one frequency or a narrow range of frequencies varying as a function of time  @xcite .",
    "thus , the fibf is sum of zero mean sinusoidal functions of consecutive frequency band .",
    "the main objective of this study is to obtain unique representation of multicomponent signal as a sum of constant and monocomponent signals , i.e. signals which can be represented by the following model  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a noise representing any residue ( constant or trend ) components and the @xmath9 are @xmath31 single component nonstationary signals , which in our proposed framework would be the fibfs , defined above .",
    "the necessary conditions  @xcite , for a basis to represent a nonlinear and nonstationary time series , are completeness , orthogonality , locality , and adaptiveness .",
    "the fibfs , intrinsically , follow all the necessary conditions by virtue of the decomposition .",
    "the available data are usually of finite duration , nonstationary and generated from the systems that are generally nonlinear .",
    "let @xmath0 be a time limited @xmath32 $ ] real valued signal which follows the dirichlet conditions .",
    "we construct the periodic signal as @xmath33 such that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , for @xmath36 and zero otherwise .",

    "moreover , it is worth noting that this representation is complete , orthogonal , local , adaptive and purely fourier based .",
    "thus , we have obtained a generalized fourier expansion of a time series in eq .   by the fourier method itself .",
    "the variable amplitude and the if have improved the efficiency of the expansion by expanding the signal into finite number of analytic fibfs , in , and enabled the expansion to accommodate nonstationary data .",
    "thus , we have obtained a variable amplitude and frequency representation , whereas , the classical fourier expansion provides the constant amplitude and fixed - frequency representation .    for each fibfs , the amplitude @xmath73 and",
    "if @xmath74 are functions of time , therefore , we define the three dimensional @xmath75 time - frequency distribution of amplitude as the fourier - hilbert spectrum ( fhs ) @xmath76 .",
    "the marginal hilbert spectrum ( mhs ) , derived from hilbert spectrum , is defined in  @xcite .",
    "similarly , here we define the marginal fourier - hilbert spectrum ( mfhs ) from the fhs as follows : @xmath77 the marginal fourier - hilbert spectrum offers a measure of total amplitude ( or energy ) contribution from each value of frequency in a probabilistic sense . the frequency in either @xmath78 or @xmath79",
    "has a different meaning from the fourier spectral analysis  @xcite .",
    "the presence of energy at each frequency in mfhs @xmath79 means that , in the total duration of the signal , there is a higher likelihood for such a wave ( fibf ) to have appeared locally .",
    "the frequency in the mfhs indicates only the likelihood that an oscillation with such a frequency exists .",
    "the exact occurrence time of that oscillation is given in the full fourier - hilbert spectrum .",
    "we can also define the instantaneous energy density , which can be used to measure the fluctuation of energy with time , as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a maximum frequency of signal . from eq .",
