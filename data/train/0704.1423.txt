    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite is a remarkably successful approach to the study of many - body systems in time - dependent external fields @xcite .",
    "the essential statement of tddft is the same as that of the well - established ground state density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite : all observables are , in principle , functionals of the particle density alone .",
    "since the latter is always a three - dimensional entity , independent of the number of particles involved , the computational cost of actual ( td)dft calculations scales exponentially more favorable than the solution of the many - body ( time - dependent ) schrdinger equation .    in practice",
    ", almost all ( td)dft calculations are performed using the ( time - dependent ) kohn - sham scheme [ ( td)ks ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) where the density is calculated with the help of auxiliary , non - interacting particles moving in an effective potential .",
    "the `` art '' of ( td)dft is two - fold , namely finding sufficiently accurate approximations to the density functionals of ( i ) the unknown effective potential and ( ii ) the observables of interest .",
    "fortunately , for many practical applications both items are uncritical @xcite .",
    "an example is the calculation of the optical response of bio - molecules where even the simple local density approximation of the effective potential yields reasonable results , and the observable can be calculated from a known and explicit functional of the density ( the time - dependent dipole ) .",
    "however , when it comes to the correlated motion of a _ few _ particles in a strongly driven system , tddft faces major challenges . in that respect ,",
    "non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi ) serves as the `` worst case '' scenario for tddft . theoretically , nsdi was addressed successfully using the strong - field approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and classical methods @xcite .",
    "the widely accepted mechanism behind nsdi relies on the rescattering of the first electron with its parent ion , collisionally ionizing ( or exciting ) the second electron .    in the recent publications refs .",
    "@xcite significant progress was made in the treatment of nsdi within tddft as far as ionization _ yields _ are concerned .",
    "the latter display as a manifestation of the electron - electron correlation involved in nsdi the celebrated `` knee '' structure in the double ionization yield , which was , until recently , not being reproduced within tddft .",
    "reference @xcite addressed issue ( i ) above ( the effective potential ) while ref .",
    "@xcite focused on item ( ii ) , the functional for the observable `` double ionization '' .",
    "it was shown that ( i ) taking the derivative discontinuities at integer bound electron numbers into account and ( ii ) using an adiabatic approximation for the correlation function needed to calculate the double ionization probability , the nsdi `` knee '' can be reproduced .    in our current work",
    "we turn to the much harder problem of momentum distributions ( or energy spectra @xcite ) . in the nsdi regime",
    "the ion momentum spectra , as measured in experiments employing `` reaction microscopes '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , show a characteristic `` double - hump '' structure , i.e. , maxima at non - vanishing ion momenta .",
    "the maxima at non - zero ion momenta are easy to understand within the rescattering scenario mentioned above : the first electron preferentially returns to the ion , collisionally ionizing the second electron , at times when the vector potential of the laser field is non - zero .",
    "since the vector potential at the ionization time equals the final drift momentum at the detector , non - vanishing electron momenta ( and , due to momentum conservation , non - vanishing ion momenta ) are likely . in a tdks treatment of nsdi in he starting from a spin - singlet state ,",
    "the rescattering scenario is `` hidden '' in a single , spatial kohn - sham ( ks ) orbital . as we shall demonstrate , taking the auxiliary ks particles for real electrons and fourier - transforming their position space product wavefunction to momentum space leads to ion momentum spectra in very poor agreement with the exact ones . a better approximation to calculate correlated electron momentum spectra in the nsdi regime is required . with the present paper we aim at contributing to this goal by showing that item ( ii ) above , namely the construction of the functional for the observable , is the critical issue while ( i ) known effective potentials are sufficient , at least at the current level of accuracy .    in sec.[section model system ] the model helium system used to study the ionization process and the ensuing momentum distributions is introduced .",
    "in sec.[section momentum densities ] the method to calculate electron and ion momentum distributions is explained .",
    "results from the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) in sec.[section momentum distribution from tdse ] serve as a reference for the results obtained using tddft in sec.[section momentum distributions from tddft ] : the insufficiency of uncorrelated functionals to calculate electron and ion momentum distributions ( sec.[section momentum uncorrelated functionals ] ) and the relative insignificance of the correlation potential ( sec.[section the role of the correlation potential ] ) lead us to the construction of correlated functionals in sec.[section momentum towards a correlated functional ] . in sec.[section momentum product phase approximation ] we introduce the product - phase approximation , which reduces the problem of approximating the correlated functionals to that of approximating the exchange - correlation function .    for consistency , we restrict ourselves to the presentation of results for laser pulses with @xmath0 and @xmath1 cycles .",
    "we stress , however , that the general conclusions drawn hold also for @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 laser pulses , as we have checked explicitly .",
    "a helium atom exposed to linearly polarized laser pulses with @xmath5 cycles and @xmath6-pulse envelopes is investigated .",
    "the length of the pulses with a frequency of @xmath7 ( corresponding to the experimentally used @xmath8 ) is @xmath9 , and the vector potential reads @xmath10 for @xmath11 and zero otherwise ( atomic units are used unless otherwise indicated ) .",
    "we use the dipole approximation , i.e. , the spatial dependence of the laser field is neglected .",
    "the linear polarization of the laser pulse thus allows us to describe the system by a one - dimensional model helium atom with soft - core potentials for the coulomb interactions .",
    "it is known that the essential features of the ionization process are described well by this model @xcite .",
    "initially , the electrons are assumed to occupy the spin - singlet groundstate of helium , and due to the neglect of magnetic effects in the dipole approximation the electrons stay in the spin - singlet state during the interaction with the laser pulse .",
    "thus it is sufficient to study the spatial wavefunction , which has to be symmetric under exchange of the electrons .",
    "the tdse @xmath12 is solved for laser pulses with different effective peak intensities @xmath13 .",
    "a trivial gauge - transformation cancels the purely time - dependent @xmath14-term and yields the hamiltonian @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the external potential is @xmath17 , the electron - electron interaction potential is given by @xmath18 .",
    "the soft - core parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are chosen to yield the correct ionization potentials . reproducing the ionization potential of @xmath21 , @xmath22 in a corresponding model @xmath21 ion fixes @xmath23 . the choice @xmath24 yields the ionization potential of helium , @xmath25 .",
    "all results presented in this work are qualitatively insensitive to the precise values of the soft - core parameters .    as the two electrons constitute a spin - singlet state for all times they are described by the same ks orbital .",
    "therefore , in a tddft treatment , we have only one time - dependent kohn - sham equation ( tdkse ) @xmath26 with the hamiltonian @xmath27 the hartree - exchange potential @xmath28 follows as @xmath29 .",
    "we have used the exact exchange term for helium @xmath30 , which is local as both electrons are described by the same orbital .    setting @xmath31 yields , in the special case of the helium atom or he - like ions , an identical description as the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) treatment ( due to the locality of @xmath32 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath39 is chosen as @xmath40 throughout this work , results being insensitive to the precise value of @xmath39 .",
    "we use @xmath41 in the hartree - exchange potential @xmath42 to acquire @xmath43 for the model helium atom .",
    "the tdse and tdkse are solved by a split - operator time propagator on a numerical grid ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    along the lines of ref.@xcite we construct from the tdse solution an exact ks orbital ( ekso ) .",
    "the schrdinger solution gives the exact density of our model helium atom @xmath44 and the exact probability current @xmath45 . from the equality of the exact and ks currents in the case of a one - dimensional system ,",
    "the phase of the ekso is determined as @xmath46",
    ". the unknown purely time - dependent phase factor @xmath47 does not affect the results presented in this work and is therefore set to zero .",
    "the ekso @xmath48 is thus identical to the orbital a tddft calculation with the exact correlation potential @xmath49 would yield via the tdks scheme .",
    "the ekso allows us to separate the challenges facing tddft calculations ( cf",
    ".  sec.[section introduction ] ) : finding ( i ) a suitable approximation of @xmath49 ( where it serves as a reference for the resulting orbital ) and ( ii ) appropriate functionals for observables ( where it is the exact input ) .",
    "we partition the two - electron space and associate with single ionization the area @xmath50 and with double ionization the area @xmath51 . integrating @xmath52 over these areas then yields the respective ionization probabilities , with the double ionization probability given by @xmath53 .",
    "this scheme to determine ionization probabilities from the two - electron wavefunction has been successfully used in numerous similar calculations @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath54 can be described equivalently in momentum space by its fourier transform @xmath55 .",
    "as the wavefunction in momentum space is normalized to one , the pair density in momentum space is given by @xmath56 .    at times",
    "@xmath57 during the laser pulse the velocity of the electrons is actually given by @xmath58 , i.e. , the sum of the canonical momentum @xmath59 and the value of the vector potential at the respective time . in this work",
    "we investigate properties of the system at @xmath60 after the laser pulse . as @xmath61 , canonical momenta @xmath62 and drift momenta",
    "are identical .",
    "we are interested mainly in the double ionization process and thus fourier transform only the wavefunction in the area @xmath63 associated with double ionization .",
    "the resulting sharp step at the boundary of @xmath63 at @xmath64 , with @xmath65 , is a potential source of artifacts when fourier transformed .",
    "hence , a smoothing function @xmath66 is introduced .",
    "the factor @xmath67 has to be of the order of one , in this work we choose @xmath68 .",
    "the smoothing function is constructed so that @xmath69 for a constant @xmath70 .",
    "this condition ensures that the wavefunction @xmath71 gives to a good approximation the same double ionization probability as the original wavefunction , i.e. , that @xmath72 .",
    "the correlated wavefunction of the electrons freed in double ionization in momentum space is thus calculated as @xmath73 this approach is equivalent to projecting out the states corresponding to single and no ionization and is known to lead to accurate momentum distributions @xcite .    from the wavefunction we construct the momentum pair density of the electrons freed in double ionization @xmath74 the probability to find at time @xmath75",
    "an electron freed in double ionization with momentum @xmath76 in @xmath77 and an electron with @xmath78 in @xmath79 is then @xmath80 .    in experiments ,",
    "it is easier to measure the momentum of the @xmath81 ion @xmath82 after double ionization instead of individual electron momenta .",
    "as the total photon momentum involved is negligibly small , this provides information about the sum of the electron momenta via momentum conservation @xmath83 .",
    "the ion momentum density then follows from the momentum pair density of the electrons freed in double ionization ( [ formula momentum pair density ] ) as @xmath84 due to the symmetry of the electron momentum pair density .",
    "the factor @xmath85 ensures the correct normalization since the system consists of only one ion but two electrons .",
    "the ion momentum density @xmath86 gives the probability to find at time @xmath75 the @xmath81 ion with momentum @xmath82 in @xmath87 .",
    "from the numerical solution of the tdse we obtain @xmath88 after the interaction with the laser pulse . in the left hand side of fig.[figure momentum pair density tdse - ekso ] the momentum pair density of the electrons freed in double ionization , as calculated from eq.([formula momentum pair density ] ) , is shown .",
    "for all but the highest intensity depicted , electrons have the highest probability to move at different velocities @xmath89 ( @xmath90 since @xmath61 , cf .  discussion in sec.[section momentum densities ] ) but in the same direction ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "depending on the laser intensity the probability for the double ionization process is highest at different half - cycles of the laser pulse , i.e. , different signs of the vector potential .",
    "therefore , the favored direction in which the electrons leave the atom varies with intensity .",
    "nsdi can be understood by a recollision mechanism where one electron returns to the @xmath21 ion and frees the second electron ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the tdse then imply that both electrons leave the atom in the same direction but due to coulomb repulsion their velocities differ , in accordance with earlier results for a longer laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the `` butterfly '' shape of the momentum pair density of the electrons freed in double ionization as shown in fig.[figure momentum pair density tdse - ekso ] is evidence that it is highly correlated , as it can not be reproduced by multiplying two orbitals for the respective electrons .    for @xmath92",
    "both electrons have the highest probability to leave the atom in the same direction with similar velocities @xmath93 .",
    "this can only be the case when the coulomb repulsion between the electrons is weak , i.e. , when they are removed sequentially , resulting in a large spatial separation .",
    "the final non - vanishing velocities are due to the high intensity of the laser pulse , which ionizes the atom so rapidly that @xmath94 when the first electron is freed .",
    "the grid - like structure typical for a product wavefunction is seen , the electron correlation being weak .    from the momentum pair density of the electrons freed in double ionization @xmath95 ( [ formula momentum pair density ] ) we calculate the ion momentum density @xmath96 ( [ formula momentum ion density ] ) . for different effective peak intensities",
    "the density of the ion momentum is depicted in fig.[figure ion momentum density tdse - ekso ] .",
    "it exhibits peaks at non - zero momenta . as explained in sec.[section introduction ] , these are typical for recollision processes when the first freed electron recollides close to the maximum of the vector potential , i.e. , when @xmath97 .",
    "hence , the sum of the momenta of both electrons is non - zero , and , by momentum - conservation , this holds for the ion momentum as well @xcite .    for an infinitely long laser pulse of laser period @xmath98 , @xmath99 holds while this symmetry is broken in the case of few - cycle laser pulses .",
    "hence , with respect to the dislodged electrons there is no spatial inversion symmetry , leading to asymmetric ion momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in fig.[figure ion momentum density tdse - ekso ] .",
    "for the three lowest intensities a process with @xmath100 dominates while with increasing intensities processes with @xmath101 become more likely .",
    "in addition , a central peak gets more and more pronounced , showing that the relative probability of sequential double ionization increases .",
    "the fact that the peak is not centered around @xmath102 for @xmath92 is again due to the high intensity and the short duration of the laser pulse , as explained above .",
    "dft can be formulated in momentum space ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and this seems to be the obvious path to follow when one is interested in the calculation of momentum spectra .",
    "however , momentum space dft lacks the `` universality '' feature of the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite , meaning that each system under study requires a different momentum space effective potential  an entirely unattractive feature .",
    "we therefore prefer to make the `` detour '' via standard , universal , position space tddft . in the case of single ionization , a straightforward calculation of the momentum or energy spectrum from the fourier - transformed valence ks",
    "orbital may be a good approximation ( see , e.g. , the approach followed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . instead , it is less obvious how to determine _ correlated _ momentum spectra from position space tdks orbitals .    as explained in the introduction ,",
    "determining momentum pair densities and ion momentum densities from a tddft approach faces two challenges : the first is to find an approximate correlation - potential @xmath49 in the tdkse to reproduce the exact density @xmath103 with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the second , more difficult one , amounts to assign a suitable functional of the density to the respective observable . as both the ion momentum density and the momentum pair density ( via their probability interpretations , cf .",
    "sec.[section momentum densities ] ) are observables , the runge - gross theorem assures that functionals of the density alone exist @xcite .      treating the ks orbital as if it were a one - electron wavefunction yields a product wavefunction @xmath104 .",
    "this is the same assumption frequently made to derive uncorrelated ionization probability functionals ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fourier transformed ks orbital for @xmath105 , i.e. , with the bound states projected out ( see sec.[section momentum densities ] ) is @xmath106 with @xmath107 the one - dimensional smoothing function equivalent to the smoothing function used in sec.[section momentum densities ] .     of the electrons freed in double ionization .",
    "results calculated from the uncorrelated functional ( [ formula momentum pair density uncorrelated ] ) using the ekso ( right hand side ) are compared to the tdse ( left hand side ) solution .",

    "this is evidence that correlations , which are not included in the uncorrelated functionals for the observables , are responsible for the distinct peaks of the ion momentum density at non - zero momenta .",
    "this result is consistent with the analysis of the results of the tdse ( sec.[section momentum distribution from tdse ] ) , which attributes the peaks at @xmath113 to electron rescattering , i.e. , to an interaction between the electrons .",

    "<S> we construct a functional of the kohn - sham orbitals , which in principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion . </S>",
    "<S> the product - phase approximation is introduced , which reduces the problem of approximating this functional significantly . </S>"
