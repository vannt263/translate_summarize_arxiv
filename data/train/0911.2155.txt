    "atomic parity violation ( apv ) has become a subject of keen interest as it has the potential to test the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and to search for new physics beyond it @xcite .",
    "several experiments have been performed over the last three decades on some heavy elements like cs @xcite , pb @xcite , tl @xcite , bi @xcite _ etc_. there are also some proposals with promising prospects on elements like yb @xcite , fr @xcite and atomic ions like ba@xmath2 @xcite and ra@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising candidates is yb whose parity non - conserving ( pnc ) amplitude @xmath3 so far the largest .",
    "this point has also been verified experimentally @xcite but the experimental precision needs to be improved in order to compete with the present bench mark value of cs pnc experiment @xcite .",
    "the experiment on cs with an accuracy of @xmath4 , has successfully explained the sm of particle physics @xcite .",
    "higher precision ( @xmath5 ) is required to search for new physics beyond sm @xcite .",
    "the physical parameter that one seeks by combining these experiments and theory is the pnc transition amplitude @xmath3 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] presently available techniques have been mentioned along with their advantages and respective challenges .",
    "a single trapped and laser cooled ion is free from unknown perturbations and it has long coherence time .",
    "systematic uncertainties are easily tractable and therefore , the system is more favored for such experiment @xcite even though this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "single ion trapping and laser cooling are routinely done in radio frequency paul traps @xcite .",
    "the possibility of apv experiment based on such a system was first put forward by fortson @xcite .",
    "the overall idea has been reviewed here in brief focusing ra@xmath2 as a possible candidate . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the relevant energy levels of singly charged radium ( ra@xmath2 ) and barium ( ba@xmath2 ) have been shown .",
    "after confining radium ion in an rf paul trap , it can be laser cooled by exciting the @xmath6 transition at @xmath7 nm .",
    "a repumping laser at @xmath8 nm is necessary to bring the ion back to the cooling cycle from the metastable @xmath9 state .",
    "atomic parity violation leads to mixing of different parity states with the ground @xmath10 state .",
    "thus the ground state has a small contribution from @xmath11 state resulting in a non - zero probability of dipole transition between @xmath10 and @xmath9 states which is normally a forbidden electric dipole transition .     and ( b ) ba@xmath2,scaledwidth=85.0% ]",
    "a transitional dipole interacts with the electric field while a quadrupole interacts with the field gradient . in an experimental setup as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is possible to induce both a dipole transition ( due to apv ) as well as a quadrupole transition between @xmath10 and @xmath9 states . the interference term of these two leads to a measurable frequency change of the larmor frequency between the ground state zeeman sublevels in presence , as compared to , in absence of the laser fields .",
    "one of the suitable laser field configurations that produce the needed apv frequency shift is @xmath12 & @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the electric field amplitudes of the two lasers .",
    "an ion placed at the antinode of @xmath16 field will suffer pnc induced electric dipole light - shift while the ion placed at the node of @xmath17 field , will show electric quadrupole light - shift .",
    "the quadrupole light - shifts of the zeeman sublevels in the ground state due to the @xmath17 field are of the same magnitude and direction .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 field will not lead to any change of the ground state larmor frequency defined by the energy difference between the zeeman sublevels of the ground state . on the contrary , the shifts due to @xmath16 field will increase the larmor frequency .",
    "this change in larmor frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the @xmath16 field .    in the experiment one measures the larmor frequency with and without these laser fields .",
    "the difference of these two frequencies therefore , gives directly the apv light - shift @xmath18 which can be expressed as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the rabi frequencies for pnc and quadrupole induced transitions which are respectively proportional to the electric field amplitude and field gradient of the standing wave lasers , @xmath22 ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the zeeman sublevels of @xmath25 and @xmath26 states respectively .",
    "the distinguished advantage of this technique is that measurement of @xmath18 is free from any fluctuation in the laser frequency and other sources of quadrupole shift ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath3 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an efficiency factor that depends on experimental conditions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the number of ions and coherence time respectively and @xmath32 is the time of observation . though @xmath33 in this experiment , longer coherence time improves the uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "accurate determination of @xmath3 from measured @xmath18 depends on precise determination of the electric fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the position of the ion in the trap which is a challenge of this experiment and is a major source of systematic uncertainty . also placing",
    "the ion at the antinode of @xmath16 field or node of @xmath17 field is a difficult task .",
    "since pnc induced light - shift ( @xmath18 ) is very small ( @xmath34 cycles / s for @xmath35 v / m for ra@xmath2 ) , little fluctuations of the magnetic field resolving zeeman sublevels , will worsen the accuracy of the result .    however , in the past decades several experimental techniques have been developed by which the above problems can be solved .",
    "one can manipulate the ion position with respect to the standing wave .",
    "recently , a technique has been reported @xcite by which the nodal point or the nodal line of the trap can be shifted upto few micrometers . thus the ion can be placed on the geometrical line of the standing wave .",
    "systematic uncertainty originating from inaccurate positioning of the ion with respect to the electric field of the laser has been determined in the following .",
    "since the ion is cooled to lamb - dicke regime , its motion is confined within its de broglie wavelength ( @xmath36 ) , typically @xmath37 nm for ra@xmath2 and ba@xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath16 and @xmath17 fields for antinodal and nodal positions respectively are @xmath38 and @xmath39 these systematic uncertainties tabulated in table  [ tab2 ] , have been estimated from the lamb - dicke parameter .",
    "there are also some techniques for controlling magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "recent improvement of high precision rf spectroscopic techniques @xcite opens up the possibility of success of the desired experiment in near future .",

    "it is @xmath65 times larger as compared to @xmath66ba@xmath2 @xcite and @xmath37 times larger than that of atomic cesium @xcite .",
    "that is why at first sight @xmath41ra@xmath2 is seemed to be a promising candidate though there are other advantages over ba@xmath2 .",

    "thus these lasers are available commercially as solid state diode lasers .",
    "radium being a heavier element may be confined within smaller orbit than barium as the lamb - dicke parameter is inversely proportional to the square root of mass of the ion . in addition , the known relative systematic uncertainties for ra@xmath2 are three times smaller as compared to ba@xmath2 .",

    "however , in @xmath68 transition in ra@xmath2 or ba@xmath2 , the contribution of nsd part is smaller by few orders than nsi part and hence determination of anapole moment is difficult . to avoid nsi part , a similar experiment explained above can be performed using @xmath69 transition of nuclear spin non - zero ( @xmath70 ) isotopes of ra@xmath2 or ba@xmath2 .",
    "pnc allowed @xmath69 transition in these isotopes contains only nsd part and may lead to a direct measurement of nuclear anapole moment .",
    "@xmath71ra@xmath2 is more favored candidate for an apv experiment than @xmath66ba@xmath2 as pnc amplitude for @xmath72 transition is @xmath73 times larger in this isotope @xcite .",
    "however , there are several disadvantages of choosing ra@xmath2 as a possible candidate . trapping and",
    "cooling of ra@xmath2 has not been demonstrated so far .",
    "the lack of spectroscopic data on ra@xmath2 is also a problem .",
    "theoretical calculation needs to be more accurate ( below 1 % ) in order to compare with the experimentally obtained data .",
    "the atomic structure of radium is not well studied .",
    "coherence time is smaller for ra@xmath2 ( @xmath74 ) which will reduce the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the systematic uncertainties originating from the determination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the ion position are too large for ra@xmath2 and demand some special experimental techniques to eliminate those .",
    "the production of various isotopes of radium for the study of nuclear structure effects on apv demands well established facilities .    at the kvi ,",
    "groningen such a facility has been developed @xcite where some isotopes of radium may be produced with an aim for performing apv experiment based on single trapped and laser cooled ra@xmath2 .",
    "atomic ra has been successfully trapped in a mot and laser cooled @xcite at argonne national laboratory in search of permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) in atoms .",
    "thus there is hope for details spectroscopic data on ra to be available shortly which will lead towards the implementation of apv experiment on ra@xmath2 .",
    "with an aim to perform high precision rf spectroscopy in search of apv , work has been started by our group rcamos at iacs .",
    "@xmath40ba@xmath2 has been chosen initially as barium is available commercially .",
