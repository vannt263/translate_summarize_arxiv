    "looking back at the outstanding experimental achievements in the field of trapped ultracold gases composed of bosonic atoms of the last 6 years one wonders what exciting new developments one has to envision in the near future @xcite .",
    "one branch of these developments will involve dilute and degenerate gases of fermionic atoms .",
    "already today several groups @xcite were able to cool samples of fermionic atoms , @xmath0li or @xmath1k , to temperatures corresponding to a fraction of the fermi energy .",
    "these experiments use either a single fermionic isotope ( @xmath1k ) in two different hyperfine states @xcite or a mixture of a fermionic and a bosonic species ( @xmath0li/@xmath2li ) @xcite . in this way",
    "s - wave scatterings between atoms of either the two fermionic components or between bosons and fermions allow efficient evaporative cooling of the gas",
    ". remember that in a gas of identical fermions s - wave interactions are suppressed by the pauli principle .",
    "the experiments on dilute degenerate fermi gases open a new and unique field to study fundamental quantum phenomena .",
    "many of the questions discussed for the bose - einstein condensed bose gas also apply to degenerate fermi gases .",
    "examples are the mean - field induced collapse of the dilute gas due to attractive interactions @xcite or the variety of collective excitations @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging experimental goals is the realization of a bcs - transition from the normal to a superfluid phase @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed understanding of the `` normal '' degenerate fermi gas is a prerequisite to achieve that .",
    "in this paper we investigate the influence of interactions on single - component and two - component fermi gases in the normal phase with special emphasis on the role of the p - wave interaction .",
    "therefore in section [ sec : ef ] we construct an effective s- and p - wave contact interaction and use it to derive the energy density of a multicomponent fermi gas in thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "on this basis we investigate the structure of one- and two - component fermi gases at zero temperature .",
    "a first question concerns is the stability of the dilute gas against collapse induced by attractive interactions . in section [ sec : col ]",
    "we derive stability conditions for the one- and two - component gas and discuss the influence of the p - wave interaction .",
    "a second question deals with the spatial separation of the different components in a two - component system . conditions for the onset of component demixing are derived in section [ sec : sep ] .",
    "we also discuss the structure of the density distributions in the separated phase .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : phasediag ] we summarize our findings by means of a zero - temperature phase diagram for the two - component fermi gas .",
    "in general the description of an interacting quantum mechanical many - body system relies on approximations to render the problem solvable .",
    "a general procedure to obtain different approximation schemes is to restrict the many - body states the system can assume to a certain subspace  called model space  of the full hilbert space .",
    "a prominent example is the mean - field approximation where the many - body state is given by a symmetrized or antisymmetrized product of single - particle states . within this mean - field model space",
    "the many - body problem can be solved ; in case of fermions the solution is obtained by the well known hartree - fock equations .",
    "however , this restriction to a model space of sufficiently simple structure encounters a serious drawback .",
    "many realistic interactions between the constituents of the many - body system exhibit a strongly repulsive short - range core in addition to the attractive part .",
    "typical examples are van der waals interactions between neutral atoms , e.g. the lennard - jones potential with an attractive part proportional to @xmath3 and a strong repulsion proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the repulsive core prevents any of the particles to approach each other closer than the core radius , in other words , the two - body density distribution is depleted or even zero for particle distances smaller than the core radius .",
    "these short - range correlations can not be described within a simple model space like the one of the mean - field approximation @xcite .    to resolve this discrepancy",
    "we transform the realistic potential into an effective interaction suited for the particular model space under consideration . in the case of cold and",
    "dilute atomic gases the properties of the physical system simplify the construction of the effective interaction significantly .",
    "this is our starting point : ( i ) we want to describe the properties of a degenerate fermi gas in the mean - field approximation , i.e. the many - body state is an antisymmetrized product state .",
    "( ii ) the system is cold and dilute , i.e. mean particle distance and wavelength of relative motion are much larger than the range of the two - body potential .",
    "( iii ) the system is in a non self - bound metastable many - body state , the two - body bound states of the potential are not populated .",
    "due to ( ii ) and ( iii ) the atoms do not probe the detailed radial dependence of the interaction , therefore we can use a simple zero - range effective potential . to describe interactions also between particles with relative angular momenta @xmath5",
    "the contact interaction has to be nonlocal .",
    "the mapping of the exact onto the effective interaction is done by means of the two - body energy spectrum : we require that the exact two - body eigenvalues @xmath6 for positive energies ( scattering states ) is reproduced by the expectation values of the effective interaction calculated with kinetic energy eigenstates @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the relative momentum of the two particles and @xmath10 their reduced mass . in the following",
    "we will consider only particles with equal masses , i.e. @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the quantum numbers of relative angular momentum , and @xmath14 is a radial quantum number @xcite .",

    "the two additional nonlocal terms are the natural extension to describe effective range effects and more important the effects of p - wave interactions .",
    "one should be aware that the effective interaction ( [ eq : ef_eci_operator ] ) is designed for the application in a mean - field model space .",
    "it does not make sense to use this interaction in a larger model space or even for the solution of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "when using erroneously this contact interaction to solve the exact scattering problem one does not get back the correct phase shifts .",
    "we construct the energy density of the inhomogeneous fermi gas in an external trapping potential within the thomas - fermi approximation , which was shown @xcite to be an excellent approximation for the particle numbers considered here .",
