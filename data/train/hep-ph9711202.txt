    "is included , which introduces another parameter @xmath102 from the soft supersymmetry - breaking potential . to summarize , we have the following free parameters : @xmath81 , one of @xmath103 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath102 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the results based on eq.([sig ] ) are plotted in figs.1 - 4 for mssm higgs bosons and in fig.5 for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the angular cutoff is chosen to be @xmath106 except for fig.3 in which @xmath107 .    in fig.1 , we show the production cross sections for the light higgs boson @xmath21 as a function of its mass @xmath82 and the center of mass energy @xmath108",
    ". different choices of @xmath109 and @xmath102 have only a marginal effect on the rates .",
    "this is because the dominant contribution comes from the standard @xmath3 and fermion loops .",
    "these are much larger than contributions from charginos and especially sfermions .",
    "the value of @xmath110 affects production rates significantly for a relatively light @xmath21 with @xmath111 gev . as @xmath82 approaches its tree level upper limit @xmath112",
    ", the rates become insensitive to @xmath110 since in this limit the reduced coupling of @xmath21 to @xmath3 is very close to unity for all sufficiently large @xmath110 .",
    "the production cross sections are relatively flat as @xmath108 varies from @xmath113 gev to @xmath114 gev , something also seen in the other figures .",
    "this behaviour is very different from that of associated photon - higgs production in the @xmath115 mode@xmath116 , and can be attributed to a balance between two opposite effects . on the one hand ,",
    "the @xmath117channel photon carries a momentum of the scale @xmath108 thus tending to suppress rates at high energies . on the other ,",
    "the scattered electrons are more concentrated around the forward cone at higher energies so that the rates are enhanced by an almost on - shell @xmath117channel photon .",
    "this may be verified by choosing a larger value of @xmath118 which is equivalent to subtracting out a larger cone around the forward direction .",
    "for example , using the same input parameters as the solid curve in fig.1(c ) except that @xmath119 , the cross section decreases by about a factor of eight between @xmath120 gev and @xmath121 gev .",
    "the production cross sections for the heavy higgs boson @xmath22 are shown in fig.2 as a function of its mass @xmath122 and @xmath108 . in this case ,",
    "different choices of @xmath109 and @xmath102 have a significant impact on rates especially for @xmath123 gev .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , compared with the case of @xmath21 , the dominant contribution from @xmath3 and fermions is relatively suppressed and the other contributions , which are sensitive to these parameters , become equally important . as @xmath122 moves down to @xmath124 gev , the four curves tend to approach one another . besides the flatness in @xmath108 discussed above ,",
    "this is also due to the fact that the reduced coupling @xmath125 happens to be almost the same for @xmath126 and @xmath127 when @xmath128 gev .",
    "contributions from different particles are displayed in figs.3 ( a ) and ( c ) for the production of @xmath21 , and in ( b ) and ( d ) for @xmath22 .",
    "we find that contributions from @xmath29 and @xmath30 loops are always very small and can thus be safely ignored .",
    "consider first figs.3 ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the dominant contribution to @xmath21 production arises from @xmath3 and fermion loops .",
    "while the @xmath129 contribution is clearly distingushable , it is several times smaller than those from the @xmath4 s and fermions .",
    "the two contributions interfere destructively for @xmath130 gev , reminiscent of the cancellation between @xmath3 and ordinary fermion loops . for our choice of input parameters",
    ", the reduced coupling @xmath131 vanishes around @xmath132 gev .",
    "then , as @xmath82 continues to increase , the sign of @xmath131 is reversed so that the two contributions interfere constructively . in fig.3 ( b ) and",
    "( d ) the sm and chargino contributions are of the same order of magnitude . for large enough @xmath122",
    ", @xmath129 can even dominate over @xmath3 and fermions ( though at that point the total cross section is lower by one or two orders of magnitude ) , since the once dominant role played by @xmath3 is diminished by its very small coupling @xmath125 .",
    "we also see that the two contributions always interfere constructively .",
    "this originates from the fact that the sign of @xmath125 is flipped as compared to the case of @xmath21 while @xmath131 remains positive .",
    "fig.3 also shows the effects of different @xmath118 .",
    "( figs.3 ( a ) and ( c ) vs. figs.1 ( a ) and ( c ) , figs.3 ( b ) and ( d ) vs. figs.2 ( a ) and ( c ) . )",
    "we verified the result of ref.@xcite that the rate scales approximately as the logarithm of @xmath118 , for sufficiently small values of @xmath118 .",
    "fig.4 serves as a comparison with the result of ref.@xcite in which the production of @xmath9 was calculated .",
    "the solid and dashed ( dotted and dotdashed ) curves are computed using the same input parameters as in figs.1 ( b ) ( ( c ) ) in that reference .",
    "we see that the cross section for @xmath21 is slightly larger than that for @xmath9 throughout most of the range of @xmath133 .    as a by - product",
    ", we show the production cross section for the sm higgs boson @xmath23 @xcite in fig.5 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath134 is comparable to that of the mssm @xmath21 in the same mass range and large @xmath110 @xcite .    in figs.(1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , the short dashed lines represent the cross section for the direct production of a @xmath135 pair with invariant mass @xmath136 in @xmath137 collisions . to minimize this background , we impose an angular cut on the @xmath138 and @xmath139 relative to the incident photon in the @xmath137 center of mass . for a cut of @xmath140 on both the @xmath138 and the @xmath139",
    ", the background is reduced by a factor of about 10 with the signal being essentially unchanged . for the mssm light higgs , @xmath141 , the background is reasonable , and at @xmath142 gev and @xmath143 gev ,",
    "the signal to square root of background ratio @xmath144 is 4.5 for 50 fb@xmath145 of luminosity .",
    "the situation is less good for the mssm heavy higgs , @xmath22 , where for @xmath142 gev and @xmath146 gev , @xmath144 = 1.8 . in the case of the sm higgs , @xmath147 ,",
    "the @xmath135 background is not significant when @xmath148gev .",
    "we have studied the production of neutral scalar higgs bosons in the mssm and the sm at future electron colliders operating in the @xmath137 mode .",
    "although the results are potentially complicated by many free parameters associated with supersymmetric particles , we find that the dominant contribution comes only from charginos , which is an automatic result in the case of @xmath9 production due to its off - diagonal couplings to bosonic particles@xmath149 .",
    "furthermore , the chargino contribution is generally significant and can be comparable to or even dominate over the ordinary contributions in the case of @xmath22 production .",
    "this may help to identify a particular type of new particle once there are experimental hints for its existence in virtual loops .",
    "finally , we comment that the cross sections computed here and in ref.@xmath149 are generally one or two orders of magnitude larger than the related associated production of photons and higgs bosons in @xmath7 collisions @xcite .",
    "this implies that the @xmath137 channel may provide an important window in the search for higgs bosons .",
