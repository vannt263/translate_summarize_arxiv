    "the study of baryonic systems composed of three static quarks sheds light on the internal structure of the baryon .",

    "is supported by recent calculations in lattice qcd @xcite . at finite temperature work",
    "so far has concentrated on simulations using maximal abelian gauge @xcite , showing the existence of a y - shaped string as well .",
    "the y - ansatz is also supported by results obtainde with the field correlator method @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been speculations that hadronic bound states , e.  g.  also colored @xmath0-states , may still exist in the high temperature deconfined phase of qcd and that they could be responsible for the observed strong interactions in the qgp near @xmath1@xcite .",
    "this makes it interesting to analyze the force in three quark systems also in non - singlet color configurations that might exist in an overall color neutral thermal medium .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the question of the flux tube shape of the @xmath0-singlet state below the critical temperature in the quenched approximation of qcd and discuss the appearance of string breaking in 2-flavor qcd .",
    "moreover , above @xmath1 we explore the relation between the free energies in different color channels of the baryonic system and the free energies of @xmath2-subsystems , and analyze the screening of octet and decuplet free energies at small distances .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section [ channels ] we present the basic observables we use for calculations in different color channels of the heavy three quark system in terms of correlation functions of thermal wilson lines . in section [ perttheory ]",
    "we discuss the perturbative behavior of free energies of three quark systems at short distances . in section [ details ]",
    "we present the details of our simulation , including calculation techniques , gauge fixing and renormalisation procedures . in section [ puregauge ]",
    "we discuss the behavior of @xmath0-free energies obtained in su(3 ) pure gauge theory on @xmath3 lattices and compare results above @xmath1 with free energies of @xmath2-systems .",

    "we analyze the screening of octet and decuplet free energies at small distances .",

    "we now construct observables for static three quark systems represented by suitable combinations of wilson lines .",
    "the derivation is similiar to that for two quark systems @xcite , but more elaborate .",

    "we have suppressed the dependence on the temperature @xmath14 .    denoting the components of the thermal wilson lines @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , we find the projectors @xmath12 by using the fierz - identity @xmath17 where the sums are over all permutations @xmath18 of the indices .",
    "the @xmath12 satisfy the usual relations for projectors @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the desired three quark correlators in the different color channels are now obtained by applying @xmath22 we find @xmath23 finally we obtain for the color averaged correlator of the three quark system , @xmath24 , the relation @xmath25 we note that the two octet correlators @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the same when calculated on the lattice .",
    "the free energy of the symmetry state @xmath28 can be obtained from the correlator in the usual way @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for thermal averages taken after gauge fixing .",
    "we have suppressed the position dependence on both sides of .    in the following section we will discuss briefly the behavior of the free energies of the three quark system for small couplings and short distances .",
    "in the perturbative expansion of the free energy of @xmath0-systems the contribution of the three gluon vertex vanishes for symmetry reasons @xcite .",
    "therefore , neglecting self energy contributions , to order @xmath32 the free energy @xmath33 decomposes into the sum of three diquark free energies @xmath34 , which can be in an anti - symmetric antitriplet @xmath35 or in a symmetric sextet @xmath36 state .",
    "the behavior of these diquark free energies at small distances to lowest order are coulombic @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the separation of the static quarks in the @xmath2-system .",

    "thus @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "moreover , the @xmath0-singlet free energy is temperature independent at small distances like the @xmath53-singlet free energy is @xcite . for the octet channels",
    "the situation is more complicated due to the contribution of both anti - triplet and sextet free energies .",
    "we can , however , compute the lowest order behavior of the @xmath0 free energies for equilateral geometries for all color channels .",
    "table [ prefactor_tab ] summarizes the casimir factors for the free energies of the different color channels for all the quark systems @xmath53 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "one recovers the lowest order behavior of the free energy in some symmetry state @xmath41 ( equilateral geomtries for the @xmath0-systems only ) that depends on the separation of the static quarks by using ( [ eq : fre_sample_qq ] ) , where @xmath39 is now the separation of the static quarks in the @xmath53- and @xmath2-systems and the edge length of the equilateral geometry in the @xmath0 case .",

    "in this case , ( [ eq : fre_qqq_singlet_small ] ) - ( [ eq : fre_qqq_decuplet_small ] ) generalize to @xmath58 where the @xmath59 with @xmath48 account for the self energy contributions not included in the diquark free energies . it was shown in @xcite that the residual @xmath14-dependence of the @xmath2-anti - triplet free energy at small distances in the deconfined phase can be removed by substracting the free energy of a single static quark @xmath60 .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath61 , which guarantees the cancelation of self energy contributions stemming from @xmath62 , leaving @xmath63 temperature independent at small separations .",
    "moreover , at large separations , the self energy contributions for the @xmath0-system should be independent from the particular color channel the system is in , leading to @xmath64 .",

    "we finally note , that the @xmath0-octet free energy obtained from the lattice is the average of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as will be shown in sec .",

    "another possible string shape is a y - shaped string , where the flux tube emanetes from each of the three quarks and has a junction at the fermat point @xmath78 of the triangle .",

    "the inner angles at the vertices of the triangle are assumed to be smaller than @xmath81 , which is the case for all triangles considered in this work .",
    "the angle between any two arms of the y - shaped flux tube is always @xmath81 . for equilateral triangles we have the simple relation @xmath82 . in this work",
    "we examine only isoscele triangles , where we set @xmath83 to be the equally long edges and @xmath84 to be the length of the base edge . for equilateral triangles",
    "we have @xmath85 for all @xmath75 .",

    "we obtain a new set of @xmath86 by holding @xmath87 fixed , whereas the two other vertices of the triangle @xmath88 and @xmath89 are moved simultanously one point of the lattice in one direction ( here : to the left ) . the base edge @xmath90 connecting these to points preserves thereby its length , which is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 denotes the lattice spacing and @xmath93 is an integer and describes the number of elementary cells the procedure starts with .",
    "the two other edges have equal lengths @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is another integer which runs between @xmath96 for every @xmath97 .",

    "we construct all correlation functions using renormalised thermal wilson lines @xmath104 , which are obtained from the bare ones calculated on lattices with temporal extend @xmath105 through multiplicative renormalisation , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the multiplicative renormalisation constant determined in @xcite , @xmath108 is the bare coupling and @xmath105 is the temporal extent of the lattice @xmath109 is calculated on .",
    "the renormalization constants only depend on the bare coupling @xcite ( and in addition on the bare quark masses in full qcd ) and furthermore are equivalent at zero and finite temperature @xcite . the renormalised three point correlation function of the thermal wilson lines , @xmath110 ,",
    "is then obtained from the bare one , @xmath111 , by @xmath112",
    "in this section we will analyze the behavior of three quark free energies in different color channels above @xmath1 .",
    "we compare results with the perturbative expressions obtained in section [ perttheory ] as well as with results obtained for @xmath2-systems in different color channels .",
    "data for the @xmath2 free energies have been taken from @xcite .",
    "below @xmath1 we examine the string shape of the baryonic system and its structure in the different color channels .      in fig .",
    "[ plc31_ochannels ] we show the free energies of three quark systems in different color channels and the average free energy for the @xmath0-system for equilateral triangles of edge length @xmath39 calculated on a @xmath70 lattice at @xmath113 .",
    "one can see clearly , that the singlet is strongly , the octet weaker attractive and the decuplet repulsive in agreement with the perturbative findings presented in sec .",
    "[ perttheory ] . for large @xmath39 at a given temperature , all free energies in the different color channels approach a common value , i.  e.  the three quarks are screened independently of their color orientation .",
    "the singlet free energy becomes temperature independent at small distances and coincides with the baryonic @xmath73 potential , @xmath114 , ( see also fig .",
    "[ plc31 ] ) , which is related to the quark - antiquark potential at vanishing temperature by the ratio of the different casimir operators , i.  e.  @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "we obtain similiar results for all other temperatures above @xmath1 .",
    "we will discuss the screening of octet and decuplet free energies at small distances in sec .",

    "we now compare the free energies of the @xmath0-system with the free energy of the @xmath2-system above @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ plc31 ] we show @xmath117 and @xmath118 versus the edge length @xmath39 of the equilateral triangles and the @xmath2 distance , respectively . according to ( [ eq : fre_qqq_singlet ] ) the second term is expected to be equal to the @xmath0-singlet free energy at least at small distances , where genuine three body forces are negligible . for all temperatures above @xmath1",
    "we indeed see that @xmath117 and @xmath119 coincide throughout the entire distance interval . in fig .",
    "[ plc310 ] we show analogously @xmath120 and @xmath121 . again we observe that both observables do coincide .",
    "we obtain similar plots for @xmath122 in accordance with ( [ eq : fre_eight ] ) .      in order to test whether the simple relation between free energies of a 3 quark system and the free energies of a 2 quark system plus self energy terms also holds for other geometries and temperatures above @xmath1 ,",
    "we calculate the difference @xmath123 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ plc31_div ] .",
    "if ( [ eq : fre_qqq_singlet ] ) also holds for these geometries , then @xmath124 should vanish , which is fullfilled to a very good degree for all perimeters except the smallest ones .",
    "again the same holds true also for the @xmath0-decuplet free energy as is evident from fig .",
    "[ plc310_div ] .",
    "this is possibly due to the effect , that the self energy of the system is no longer the sum of the self energy of the individual static quarks at short distances but rather that of a single static quark in the corresponding color representation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : screening ] ) .",
    "having now established that ( [ eq : fre_qqq_singlet ] ) and ( [ eq : fre_qqq_decuplet ] ) hold for all isoscele geometries above @xmath1 calculated in this work , it is clear that the screening length of the three quark system in the singlet state is the same as that of the antitriplet diquark state , which itself has been shown to be equal to that of the @xmath53 singlet state @xcite , therefore reflecting the properties of the thermal medium rather than that of a particular hadronic system .",
    "furthermore , we can apply the relations used in @xcite to calculate entropy and internal energy from free energies of a @xmath2 system also for the @xmath0 system .",
    "the entropy in the color singlet channel is defined by @xmath125 and the internal energy in this channel is @xmath126 we then obtain for the entropy @xmath127 i.  e.  the entropy contribution in the free energy of the @xmath0 singlet color channel vanishes at small distances .",
    "moreover , we find for the internal energy , that @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 is the quark - anti - quark potential at @xmath73 .",
    "this means that the internal energy becomes @xmath14-independent for small perimeters and thus , together with ( [ qqq_entropy ] ) , the singlet free energy itself is @xmath14-independent for small perimeters , as was already seen in sec .",
    "[ pg_color_channels ] .",
    "this behavior is already known for @xmath131 singlet free energies and reflects the fact that the baryonic system is less and less effected by the surrounding thermal medium when going to smaller and smaller perimeters .",
    "we now examine the @xmath0 free energies below @xmath1 .",
    "we start by looking at the relation between the @xmath0-singlet and the @xmath2-antitriplet free energies .",
    "if @xmath132 can be expressed in terms of the sum of @xmath133 also below @xmath1 , i.  e.  if a @xmath77-ansatz for the flux tube shape together with the same string tension holds , then @xmath132 is a function of the perimeter only and @xmath134 should be equal to a @xmath14-dependent constant @xmath135 for all @xmath136 . in fig .",
    "[ plc31_div_u ] we show @xmath137 for @xmath138 versus the perimeter , @xmath136 , for different geometries .",
    "here we have set @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the smallest perimeter calculated .",
    "we can see clear deviations of @xmath124 to smaller values , most strongly for the lowest temperatures , deviations from zero becoming smaller with growing temperature .",
    "for @xmath141 we have @xmath142 .",
    "hence , @xmath143 can not be expressed in terms of the sum of @xmath133 except close to the critical temperature .",
    "we are left with two possibilities now .",
    "first , we could still have a @xmath77-shaped flux tube , but with a different string tension than that observed for the @xmath2-antitriplet .",
    "since we see @xmath144 , we would expect the string tension to be smaller than in the @xmath2-antitriplet .",
    "in this case the perimeter @xmath136 would still be the right distance measure for the @xmath0-singlet free energy , i.  e.  @xmath132 should be a smooth function of @xmath136 for all geometries . or ,",
    "secondly , the flux tube is y - shaped and @xmath109 is the right distance measure . in this case , @xmath132 should be a smooth function of @xmath109 for all geometries in which a flux tube can form .",
    "to elaborate more on the shape of the flux tube , we take a closer look at the @xmath0-singlet free energy at a particular temperature below @xmath1 .",
    "we analyze the free energy for different geometries as a function of @xmath109 and @xmath136 . for equilateral triangles a simple geometrical relation exists between the length of a y - shaped flux tube @xmath109 and the length of a @xmath77-shaped flux tube @xmath136 , which is @xmath82 . hence for equilateral geometries the @xmath0-singlet free energy is a smooth function in both anstze . for more general geometries like the isoscele triangles we calculated , no simple relation between @xmath109 and @xmath136 exists . this may help to clarify the situation more directly .",
    "therefore we plot the @xmath0-singlet free energy at @xmath145 versus the y - string length @xmath109 and the perimeter @xmath136 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ plc31_ystring ] for equilateral geometries and also for isoscele geometries up to @xmath146 ( see sec .  [ calc_technique ] ) .",
    "we observe that the @xmath0-singlet free energy is indeed a smooth function of @xmath109 for all geometries calculated . on the other hand , when the free energy is plotted versus the perimeter",
    "@xmath136 different branches become visible depending on the geometry .",
    "this is most prominent for the @xmath100 triangles .",
    "therefore we find strong hints , that the shape of the flux tube in the @xmath0-singlet system is indeed that of the y - ansatz and its string length @xmath109 is the right distance measure for the system .",
    "having established this , we take a look at the other color channels below @xmath1 and analyze whether they display a smooth behavior as function of @xmath109 as well . in fig .",
    "[ plc3_cc_u ] we show the different color channels of the @xmath0-free energy at @xmath145 over the y - string length @xmath109 .",
    "we see again that the singlet is the most attractive channel followed by the average free energy , which is also a smooth function of @xmath109 .",
    "the octet channel is still attractive , but weaker so than the average free energy .",
    "the decuplet free energy is attractive for large @xmath109 but becomes flat at smaller @xmath109 , possibly hinting at a turnover and at a repulsive behavior at even smaller @xmath109 .",
    "both the decuplet and the octet channel are not smooth functions over either distances @xmath109 and @xmath136 , but become volatile for @xmath147 .",
    "this suggests that no flux tube forms in these two channels , besides that the octet free energy shows an overall attractive behavior .",
    "finally , we examine more closely the temperature dependence of @xmath132 . in fig .",
    "[ plc31_ren_u ] we show the renormalised @xmath0-singlet free energy versus @xmath109 for all temperatures below @xmath1 . we observe @xmath148 to nearly coincide at distances @xmath149 for all temperatures @xmath150",
    "we see that at large distances the free energies approach @xmath151 represented by the black line in fig .",
    "[ plc31_ren_u ] , where @xmath18 denotes the string tension in a @xmath53-system .",
    "the phenomenon of an almost @xmath14-independent string tension has also been observed in @xcite , using a fit ansatz in full qcd . as was already seen in fig .",
    "[ plc31_div_u ] , at @xmath141 we observe deviations to smaller values .",
    "this might be due to flux tube broadening setting in near @xmath1 , leading to an overlapping of the three branches of the y - shaped flux tube . filling the space between the three static quarks the separation dependence of the singlet free energy is effectively described by the @xmath77-ansatz at these temperatures .",
    "in this section we analyse the @xmath0-free energies obtained on a @xmath152 lattice in 2-flavor qcd with a bare quark mass of @xmath153 . for further details , see sec .",

    "[ plc31_1.99_fqcd ] we show the free energies of three quark systems with equilateral geometries in different color channels at @xmath154 . like in the pure gauge case",

    "both curves coincide for all temperatures above @xmath1 .",
    "thus we find the @xmath0-singlet free energy of equilateral geometries can be described as the sum of three @xmath2-antitriplet free energies plus self energy terms as well in 2-flavor qcd above @xmath1 .",
    "below @xmath1 we expect to see string breaking also in the @xmath0-singlet free energy , the breaking mechanism being more involved than in the @xmath53 case @xcite .",
    "indeed , except at @xmath156 , where both quantities agree , we see deviations for the @xmath0-singlet from the simple relation to the @xmath2 free energies . in fig .",
    "[ plc31_strbrk ] we compare @xmath148 in 2-flavor qcd ( @xmath157 ) and pure gauge theory ( @xmath158 ) for all geometries calculated . here",
    "the pure gauge data have been obtained from simulations on a @xmath69 lattice .",
    "the @xmath159 free energies start to deviate from the pure gauge result already at short distances to smaller values and eventually become flat . specifying a definite value for the string breaking distance is quite difficult given the present data .",
    "nevertheless we can give a rough estimate for the distance at which the pure gauge free energies assumes the asymptotic value of the 2-flavor free energies , which is @xmath160 .",
    "for higher @xmath14 , this distance becomes smaller . the string breaking distance for the @xmath53 singlet free energies has been determined in @xcite as the distance where the @xmath73 potential assumes the large distance asymptotic value of the free energy .",

    "both quantities coincide for all @xmath39 , at smaller @xmath14 we observe deviations to smaller values for @xmath120 .    hence we see , that the singlet ( decuplet ) @xmath0 free energy can be described as a sum of antitriplet ( sextet ) @xmath2 free energies and the self energy contributions of the three quarks above @xmath1 ( eqs ( [ eq : fre_qqq_singlet ] ) and ( [ eq : fre_qqq_decuplet ] ) ) also in 2-flavor qcd .",
    "again , we obtain similar plots for @xmath122 in accordance with ( [ eq : fre_eight ] ) .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the screening of diquark free energies in the anti - triplet and sextet representation at small distances becomes identical to the screening of a single fermion in a color anti - triplet and sextet representation , respectively .",
    "this holds for all temperatures in 2-flavor qcd and in the deconfinement phase of su(3 ) pure gauge theory .",
    "we will now show , that analogous statements are true in the deconfinement phase for octet free energies of the @xmath165-system and for octet and decuplet free energies of the @xmath0-system , as we have proposed in sec .",
    "[ perttheory ] .    when combining singlet and octet free energies or singlet and decuplet free energies in proportion to the corresponding casimir factors ( cf",
    ".  tab .",
    "[ prefactor_tab ] ) such that the repulsive and attractive coulombic contributions cancel , we expect to find @xmath166 and @xmath167 where @xmath39 stands for the edge length of the equilateral geometries in the case of @xmath0 free energies ; @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the free energies of a static quark in a color octet and decuplet representation , respectively .",
    "the latter are given by the corresponding polyakov loop expectation values , @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are obtained through group theoretical relations .",
    "the polyakov loops @xmath173 and @xmath174 have been computed in @xcite .",
    "we note here , that these quantities  unlike the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation  do not have to vanish in the confinement phase of su(3 ) pure gauge theory due to their vanishing triality .",
    "( [ f8 ] ) - ( [ f10 ] ) are indeed fulfilled for all temperatures above @xmath1 as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ plc38_screen ] and [ plc310_screen ] .",
    "in particular , the combinations of singlet and octet free energies of the @xmath165- and the @xmath0-system coincide in the deconfinement phase ( [ f8a ] ) , thus showing the screening at small distances to depend only on the color representation and not on the particular static quark system under consideration .",
    "below @xmath1 deviations become apparent in fig .",
    "[ plc38_screen ] .",
    "the reason probably is , that the minimal distances used in the present analysis ( @xmath175 for the @xmath165-system and @xmath176 for the @xmath0-system respectively ) are still too large at small temperatures to be a good approximation for the small distance limit in ( [ f8 ] ) - ( [ f10 ] ) . in fact , the @xmath177 data , where the lattice spacing @xmath92 is only half as large at the same value of the temperature , agree much better at least close to @xmath1 .",
    "we have calculated the free energy of static three quark systems in different color channels in the quenched approximation and in 2-flavor qcd at finite temperature .",
    "we have shown that above the critical temperature the singlet and decuplet free energies of the three quark system can be described by the sum of the free energies of the corresponding diquark system plus self energy contributions .",
    "therefore the screening of the singlet @xmath0 free energies is comparable to that of the @xmath2 free energies reflecting the screening properties of the thermal medium .",
    "below @xmath1 we found evidence for a y - shaped flux tube in the quenched approximation for the singlet and color average channel .",
    "the string tension agrees with that deduced from @xmath53-systems at @xmath73 and has been found to be independent of temperature for @xmath178 in the singlet color channel . in 2-flavor qcd",
    "we observed string breaking in the @xmath0 singlet free energies at distances around @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , we were able to show that at short distances the screening properties of octet free energies of the @xmath53- and the @xmath0-system and the decuplet free energies of the @xmath0-system coincide with those of a single static quark in the corresponding color state above @xmath1 .",
