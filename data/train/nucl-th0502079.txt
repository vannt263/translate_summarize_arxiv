    "the modification of kaon properties in high - density / temperature hadronic matter has been attracting much interest in the field of hadron physics , including the strangeness degree of freedom in heavy - ion collisions , especially in relation to kaon and/or antikaon production .",
    "specifically , since the possible existence of antikaon condensation was suggested in neutron stars @xcite , its implications for astrophysical phenomena have been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "the examples are effects of softening of the equation of state on the static and dynamic properties of neutron stars @xcite and thermal evolution of neutron stars through extra mechanisms of neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath0-wave antikaon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) attractive interactions given by the scalar interaction simulated by the @xmath7 sigma term ( @xmath8 ) and the vector interaction corresponding to the tomozawa - weinberg term work as the main driving forces for kaon condensation .",
    "the same conclusion was obtained with scalar and vector interactions in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model , but based on quark degrees of freedom@xcite . in neutron - star matter ,",
    "the lowest antikaon excitation energy , @xmath9 , decreases because of these @xmath0-wave @xmath10 interactions . at a certain density",
    ", @xmath9 meets the antikaon chemical potential , which is equal to the electron chemical potential through the chemical equilibrium condition with respect to the weak interaction processes , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . at this density ,",
    "the system becomes unstable with respect to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the antikaons through the weak interaction processes , @xmath13 , @xmath14@xcite . as a result",
    ", net strangeness is abundant in the fully - developed @xmath15-condensed phase .",
    "on the other hand , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , it is expected that many species of hadrons , in particular , a lot of strange particles , are produced in the hot and dense zone , where total strangeness is conserved because the typical time scales of the strong interaction are @xmath16 sec , being much shorter than those of the strangeness - changing weak interaction . in such _ a strangeness - conserving system _ , hyperons and kaons are produced through the following typical reactions , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "it has been suggested by nelson and kaplan @xcite that ( ) -pair condensation would occur in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . as the density increases ,",
    "the lowest energy of ( ) is reduced by the s - wave @xmath7 interaction ( mainly by the @xmath7-sigma term , ) and the energy of ( ) eventually becomes equal to the strangeness chemical potential @xmath19 , while that of ( ) reaches @xmath20 simultaneously , and ( ) -pair condensation occurs without loss of energy .",
    "however , their conclusion seems to be unlikely in light of the subsequent studies of the kaon properties in medium ; the excitation energy acquires repulsion instead of attraction  @xcite .",
    "moreover , only nucleon matter was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite but no hyperon degrees of freedom was taken into account .    concerning strange particle production , hyperon and kaon pairs",
    "are expected to be produced more favorably than kaon - antikaon pairs because of the different threshold energy : the production energy of the lambda and kaon pair might be smaller than that of kaon and antikaon pair . in the case of lambda - kaon pair production , the strange baryon chemical potential increases as the baryon density increases , and",
    "so the strangeness chemical potential , @xmath21 , has to increase so as to ensure strangeness conservation for the system . when the lowest excitation energy of the @xmath22 becomes equal to @xmath21",
    ", bec occurs . following this mechanism ,",
    "the possibility of kaon ( @xmath22 ) condensation in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been discussed within hadronic models@xcite .    triggered by the studies of kaon condensation , the kaon - nucleon interaction in nuclei , in particular the antikaon optical potential , has been elaborated in connection with kaonic atoms@xcite , subthreshold kaon and antikaon production in heavy - ion collisions and/or proton - nucleus collisions@xcite .",
    "the nature of the @xmath4(1405 ) in nuclear matter has been discussed in relation to the @xmath0-wave antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitude@xcite . in line with their studies , theoretical",
    "work has been carried out on the antikaon optical potential with coupled channel approaches based on chiral models@xcite , or with a reaction matrix method@xcite .",
    "there is still some controversy about the magnitude of the depth of the antikaon optical potential@xcite . on the assumption that the @xmath4(1405 ) is a bound state of the antikaon and nucleon due to the strongly attractive antikaon - nucleon interaction ,",
    "deeply bound kaonic nuclei have been recently proposed@xcite , and some experimental evidence has been reported@xcite .    for the kaons , it has been shown that the modification influences kaon production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite , the dilepton production rate in the relativistic boltzmann - uhling - uhlenbeck approach ( rbuu )  @xcite and/or the structure of the fireball  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , recent hypernuclear experiments have opened a new stage to explore the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions@xcite .",
    "the information obtained in these studies of in - medium kaon dynamics in nuclei and hypernuclear physics may in turn provide us with a clue to clarify the interrelations between kaons and hyperons and the existence of kaon / antikaon condensations formed in heavy - ion collisions and/or in neutron stars . in case of neutron stars ,",
    "hyperon - mixing in a dense matter has been discussed in a realistic situation@xcite .",
    "the interplay between kaons and hyperons has been considered by several authors@xcite .",
    "in particular , mechanisms for kaon condensation caused by the @xmath1-wave kaon - baryon interaction have been elucidated@xcite .    in order to study the high - density hadronic matter realized in heavy - ion collisions , relativistic covariant kinematics",

    "a plausible approach is the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory , where meson - baryon interactions are naturally incorporated in the relativistic framework .",
    "the possibility of producing strange hadronic matter in relativistic heavy - ion collisions was suggested on the basis of the rmf approach , where the abundance of @xmath4 or other hyperons overwhelms that of the nucleons  @xcite .",
    "however , only baryons were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite rather than kaons , which are the lightest mesons carrying strangeness . because the properties of kaons are expected to be modified significantly by the surrounding nuclear medium",

    ", it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the energy gain due to kaon condensation is moderated in neutron - star matter by the @xmath24-@xmath25 mechanism , which is caused by the suppression of the @xmath0-wave scalar interaction simulated by the @xmath7-sigma term ( ) , due to the small effective nucleon mass .",
    "this self - suppression effect should also reveal itself in symmetric nuclear matter .    in this paper , we extend the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to incorporate the lambda - nucleon ( ) loop into the kaon self - energy , and study kaon properties in dense symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "first , the solutions to the dispersion equation for the kaon are obtained by including the real part of the kaon self - energy .",
    "we find two collective modes in addition to the usual kaon and antikaon ones .",
    "however , we show that one of the collective modes , which lies within the continuum region of the @xmath4 particle - nucleon hole excitation , does not really exist on the physical sheet , by analyzing the dispersion equation in the complex energy plane .",
    "we discuss in detail the effects of the @xmath1-wave kaon - baryon interaction of the axial - vector coupling on the kaon dispersion relations and clarify the onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in the relativistic framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the latter interaction is introduced in the same scheme as the  minimal  coupling between the kaon current and vector mesons in the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model@xcite . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) is the @xmath1-wave kaon - baryon interaction with the axial - vector coupling with @xmath37(@xmath38 ) being the @xmath39 coupling constant divided by the kaon mass .",
    "we take @xmath40 , with @xmath41(=0.81 ) and @xmath42 ( = 0.44 ) being the coefficients of the axial - vector coupling terms for the kaon - baryon interaction in the effective chiral lagrangian@xcite .",

    "however , this @xmath103 state does not really exist as a real solution to the dispersion equation , @xmath277 , nor even as a complex solution on the physical sheet of the @xmath71 plane .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : contour ]  ( a)@xmath204(c ) , one can also see that the order of the @xmath76 and @xmath2 states is exchanged within a small density interval : below the density @xmath160=2.53 @xmath106 , the @xmath76 state lies lower in pole energy than the @xmath2 state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ]  ( a ) ] . just above this density , the closed solid contour , which is relevant to the collective @xmath2 and @xmath103 states , is connected outside the real axis with the open solid contour which is relevant to the @xmath76 state . with further increase in density ,",
    "the @xmath76 state is transferred to the location lying higher in pole energy than the @xmath2 state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ]  ( c ) ] .",
    "subsequently , the area of the closed contour gets small as density increases , and it disappears at a certain high density , where both the @xmath103 and @xmath2 states disappear and only the @xmath3 and @xmath76 states persist over the high densities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - rho ] , we show the density - dependences of the pole energies @xmath121 with the zero momentum transfer ( @xmath161=0 ) , obtained from the dispersion equation @xmath278=0 , by the solid line . for comparison ,",
    "those for which the @xmath58 contribution to the self - energy is put to be zero is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the dotted lines represent the two boundaries , @xmath279 and @xmath280 , of the continuum region .",
    "there appears an apparent branch of the @xmath103 mode in the continuum region for @xmath160=2@xmath2043 @xmath106 .",
    "this unphysical state disappears together with the @xmath2 state at @xmath281 3 @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the onset of pair condensation at @xmath160= 4.1 @xmath106 is caused by the @xmath3 and @xmath76 states in the nonrelativistic case , where the effective baryon masses are taken to be the free masses .",
    "it is to be noted that the onset of @xmath282 condensation is essentially determined by the @xmath0-wave interactions brought about by the @xmath7 sigma term and the tw term and that the @xmath58 contribution to the kaon self - energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonrelaself ] ) is hardly effective around this critical density .",
