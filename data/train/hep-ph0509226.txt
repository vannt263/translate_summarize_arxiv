    "it is important to understand theoretically the mechanisms by which quark - gluon plasmas can locally equilibrate in heavy ion collisions such as those at rhic . since the path - breaking work of baier , mueller , schiff and son @xcite on `` bottom - up '' thermalization",

    "typically , theorists expect to be able to solve weakly - coupled problems , but equilibration of weakly - coupled non - abelian plasmas has proven to be a very rich and challenging problem . in particular , the original attempt by baier  did not account for the physics of plasma instabilities , which are now believed to play a crucial role during some of the early stages of thermalization @xcite .",
    "early in a heavy - ion collision , particles have an anisotropic distribution of momenta , as measured in local frames moving with the expanding plasma @xcite .",
    "later , they scatter and equilibrate to locally isotropic distributions , giving rise to hydrodynamic behavior . generically , anisotropic distributions of particles produce collective plasma instabilities known as weibel or filamentary instabilities .",
    "these instabilities are associated with filamentation of particle currents and initially exponential growth of long - wavelength magnetic fields . since these magnetic fields in turn deflect the particles in the plasma , and so perhaps drive the particles towards isotropization and equilibration , it has been important to understand just how large these unstable magnetic fields grow @xcite .    in this paper , we will follow the nomenclature of baier  and refer to the initial particles of the plasma ( _ e.g. _  small @xmath5 gluons in the saturation picture ) as `` hard particles , '' and we will refer to their momentum scale ( _ e.g. _  the saturation scale ) as @xmath6",

    "most of the energy that will become the quark - gluon plasma is still in hard particles , @xmath165 , which have not yet thermalized and which are locally extremely anisotropic",
    ".    it would be delightful to be able to apply the current understanding of plasma instability development to produce a complete picture of thermalization in the high energy limit , finally completing the program initiated by the original bottom - up scenario .",
    "a lot of progress has been made over the last year in understanding the qualitative behavior and parametric dependence of the non - perturbative physics of instabilities for the case of moderately anisotropic hard particles .",
    "unfortunately , figuring out the detailed role of instabilities in bottom - up thermalization will likely require at least a similar level of understanding of the case of _ extremely _ anisotropic hard particles , which have not yet been investigated non - perturbatively .",
    "we would like to thank larry yaffe and berndt mueller for useful conversations .",

    "in this appendix , we consider the @xmath80 process of inverse bremsstrahlung , catalyzed by the soft , non - perturbative field , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2to1 ] .",
    "we will treat a case slightly more general than that depicted in the figure , namely the case of one particle with momentum @xmath166 and another particle with a momentum @xmath167 larger than @xmath7 , up to and including the scale @xmath36 .",
    "we will find that the coherence time of this process is longer than the mean free time between collisions of the particles with the soft background ( via fig .",
    "[ fig:1to1 ] ) , and so we will have to account for the landau - pomeranchuk migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite in estimating the rate of inverse bremsstrahlung .    for an initial estimate , however , let us momentarily ignore the lpm effect and consider the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:2to1 ] in isolation .",
    "bremsstrahlung in a soft background is a small - angle , nearly - collinear process .",
    "parametrically , the rate for bremsstrahlung or inverse bremsstrahlung may be estimated as ( i ) the rate for small - angle scattering from the background field ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1to1 ] ) , times ( ii ) a factor of @xmath168 for absorbing or emitting the additional gluon in fig .",
    "[ fig:2to1 ] , times ( iii ) an initial or final state factor of @xmath18 or @xmath169 for that gluon , and ( iv ) a momentum integral @xmath170 ( responsible for the logarithmically large rate of soft bremsstrahlung emission in vacuum ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dominant ] , the rate for small - angle scattering from the non - perturbative background is @xmath68 .",
    "this gives @xmath171 for ( inverse ) bremsstrahlung .",
    "to find the rate for a particle with momentum @xmath172 to substantially change its energy , we must correct for two things .",
    "first , absorbing a momentum @xmath173 makes only an order @xmath174 relative change to @xmath2 .",
    "second , it is the difference between the rates of absorption and emission of a particle of momentum @xmath167 which is relevant .",
    "this involves the difference @xmath175 .",
    "therefore we must introduce two powers of @xmath176 into the estimate above , to get @xmath177 for doubling energy through inverse bremsstrahlung . for @xmath178 ,",
    "this is dominated by @xmath179 , and gives @xmath180 ( up to logarithms when @xmath30 ) . if we equated the power of @xmath36 in ( [ eq : nolpm2 ] ) with that in ( [ eq : ir ] ) , we would obtain @xmath30 , which would imply that this process was parametrically just as important as the multiple soft scattering treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : dominant ] .",
    "however , the rate ( [ eq : nolpm ] ) is an overestimate ; we must account for the lpm effect .    in abelian theories",
    ", lpm suppression occurs because ( i ) when a charged particle scatters , the probability that a photon will be bremsstrahlung emitted is not very sensitive to the scattering angle , and ( ii ) an emitted photon of a given wavelength can not resolve the difference between a single collision and @xmath70 collisions if the @xmath70 collisions are close enough together .",
    "the largest such @xmath70 can be determined parametrically by equating ( i ) the time @xmath181 for @xmath70 consecutive scatterings of the form of fig .",
    "[ fig:1to1 ] , where @xmath109 is the mean free time between scatterings , with ( ii ) the formation time @xmath182 for the complete @xmath183 bremsstrahlung ( or @xmath184 inverse bremsstrahlung ) process , where @xmath185 is the off - shellness of the energy during the process , which is @xmath186 for a @xmath187 process with @xmath188 . for the reasons of resolution already mentioned ,",
    "each @xmath70 collisions are equivalent to a single collision in terms of the probability to induce bremsstrahlung , and so the rate @xmath49 for ( inverse ) bremsstrahlung processes is a factor of @xmath70 smaller than the naive estimate ( [ eq : nolpm ] ) which treats every scattering as independent .    the same sort of estimate works for gluon bremsstrahlung in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "since bremsstrahlung is an almost collinear process , we can take @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is relative to the collinear axis , and approximate ( [ eq : deltae ] ) for @xmath23 as @xmath191 the main difference between photon bremsstrahlung in qed and gluon bremsstrahlung in qcd is that , in qcd , any of the three particles ( including the bremsstrahlung gluon ) can undergo the scattering .",
    "therefore we may take each @xmath192 , in which case @xmath185 is dominated by the smallest energy particle , which is @xmath167 in our case .",
    "further , @xmath193 can be dropped , giving @xmath194 plugging into ( [ eq : deltae2 ] ) , and equating the scattering time @xmath195 to @xmath181 as outlined previously , we have @xmath196 solving for @xmath70 , and using the fact that @xmath197 for the individual scattering processes of fig .",
    "[ fig:1to1 ] , determines @xmath198 therefore , the rate is reduced by a factor of @xmath199 , which is a large suppression for @xmath200 .",
    "this modifies eq .",
    "( [ eq : nolpm2 ] ) to , @xmath201 this expression is dominated by small @xmath167 if @xmath202 .",
    "the @xmath203 edge of the range of integration provides @xmath204 , which combined with ( [ eq : ir ] ) would now yield @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , _ hard _ bremsstrahlung is not a competitive process .",
    "however , the @xmath206 edge of the integration range gives @xmath207 , which combines with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ir ] ) to give @xmath30 . absorption of an excitation with energy of order @xmath7 is competitive with ( and possibly indistinguishable from ) scattering from such excitations , but inverse bremsstrahlung of all harder scales is subdominant .",
