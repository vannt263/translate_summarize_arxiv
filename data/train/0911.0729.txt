    "over the last decade , the synergy of 8 - 10 meter class telescopes with hst has strongly re - invigorated the field of galaxy formation and evolution by unveiling very distant galaxies up to z@xmath46 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , by allowing the first determination of the global star formation history since redshift z@xmath46 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and by providing the first insights on the stellar mass assembly history out to z@xmath45 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite these recent progresses ,",
    "the outstanding question remains on how and when galaxies assembled their baryonic mass across cosmic time .",
    "the cdm standard model has provided a satisfactory scenario describing the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos , in a bottom - up sequence which is now well - established over the whole mass structure spectrum .",
    "in contrast , little progress has been made in the physical understanding of the formation and evolution of the baryonic component because the conversion of baryons into stars is a complex , poorly understood process .    as a result ,",
    "all intellectual advances in galaxy formation and evolution over the last decade have been essentially empirical , often based on phenomenological ( or semi - analytical ) models , which heavily rely on observations to describe , with simplistic rules , such processes as star formation efficiency , energy feedback from star formation and agn , chemical evolution , angular momentum transfer in merging , etc .",
    "cornerstones observations in this empirical framework are the total and stellar mass of galaxies and their physical properties , including the age and metallicities of their underlying stellar populations , dust extinction , star formation rate , and structural / morphological parameters .",
    "the study of well - established scaling relations involving a number of these physical parameters ( e.g. mass - metallicity , fundamental plane , colour - magnitude , morphology - density ) are essential for understanding the physical processes driving galaxy evolution . however , with the current generation of 10m - class telescopes , we have been able to construct for example the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies , or to measure the tully - fisher relation of late - type galaxies over a wide range of masses only at low and intermediate redshifts ( z@xmath61 ) , whereas only the brightest or most massive galaxies have been accessible at z @xmath2 1 , and a direct measurement of masses has been almost completely out of reach at z @xmath2 2 .",
    "thus , our ability to explore the evolution and origin of the aforementioned scaling relations has rapidly reached the limit of 10m - class telescopes .",
    "hence , most of the outstanding questions arisen from recent observational galaxy evolution studies which have pushed the 10m - class telescopes to their limits call for an extremely large telescope ( elt ) , specifically to extend the spectroscopic limit by at least two magnitudes with near - diffraction limit angular resolution .",
    "ifu spectrographs on 8 - 10 m class telescopes ( e.g. , vlt / sinfoni and keck / osiris ) are now routinely deriving the spatially - resolved kinematics of massive ( i.e. , with stellar masses larger than 10@xmath7 ) , distant galaxies , from z@xmath40.4 to z@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "such studies have brought new and essential insights into galaxy evolution processes , such as the fraction of rotators as a function of redshift @xcite , a better understanding of the evolution of the tully - fisher relation @xcite , or the first glimpse into the evolution of the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however , several uncertainties and limitations remain , especially at the highest redshifts ( i.e. , z@xmath21 ) .",
    "for instance , z@xmath42 surveys were drawn from different selection criteria ( e.g. , bx , bm , or bzk galaxies ) , and this might bias the resulting sample in a subtle and quite uncontrolled way . besides , samples in the nir are selected in optimal atmospheric windows , free of oh sky lines and maximising the atmospheric throughput , which intrinsically limits the redshift range and size of the resulting sample .",
    "the only way to overcome these issues is to move to telescopes with larger collecting areas .",
    "eso is currently developing a phase b study for a european 42-meter telescope @xcite . as part of the project development",
    ", the design reference mission ( drm ) aims at producing a set of observing proposals and corresponding simulated data which together provide the project with a tool to assess the extent to which the e - elt addresses key scientific questions and assist in critical trade - off decisions . in the frame of the drm effort",
    ", simulations of 3d high - z galaxy observations were undertaken .",
    "these observations are expected to yield direct kinematics of stars and gas in the first generation of massive galaxies ( in the range 0.1 @xmath8 m @xmath8 5@xmath910@xmath10m@xmath11 ) , as well as their stellar population properties .",
    "this will allow one to derive dynamical masses , ages , metallicities , star - formation rates , dust extinction maps , to investigate the presence of disk and spheroidal components and the importance of dynamical processes ( e.g. merging , in / outflows ) which govern galaxy evolution .",
    "these data will also allow one to study the onset of well known scaling relations at lower redshifts , and to witness the gradual shift of star formation from the most massive galaxies in the highest density regions to less massive galaxies in the field .    to assess the science achievement of an nir ifs on the e - elt , as well as to better understand the interactions between the telescope , site , and instrument , we have produced an extensive set of @xmath41000 simulations of observations of very distant galaxies .",
    "it is important to realize that if one wants to study what kind of instrument is needed to understand the galaxy mass assembly process , then one needs to explore a huge parameter space , i.e. , from relaxed smooth or clumpy rotating disks to major and minor mergers , taking care of spanning all possible mass ratios , viewing angles , merger geometry and so on , which would make such a direct approach very difficult , and probably even impossible , on the practical side .",
    "moreover , one has to recognise that our knowledge and understanding of the physics of distant galaxies is still incomplete , which necessitates to extrapolate some of their characteristics .",
    "therefore , the simulations presented in this paper do not intend to be exhaustive in any sense .",
    "rather , we aim at exploring this very large parameter space using reasonable assumptions and guesses .",
    "indeed , the drm exercise consisted in a broad exploration of the parameter space in realistic observing conditions , in order to identify possible limitations and/or breaking points , as well as interactions between the telescope , site , and instrument , which could potentially impact the telescope design .",
    "this paper is the second of a series that explores the performances of a nir ifs on the e - elt . in the first paper",
    ", we presented our methodology to simulate realistic observations of distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "we also produced first simulations and explored performance using a few scientifically - motivated cases .",
    "they illustrated the concept of `` scale - coupling '' , i.e. , the relationship between the ifu pixel scale and the size of the kinematic features that need to be recovered by 3d spectroscopy in order to understand the nature of the galaxy and its substructure .",
    "in @xcite , we focused on the largest spatial scales , which are of particular interest because they carry most of the kinematic information useful to reveal the process underlying galaxy dynamics , i.e. , whether a given galaxy is in a coherent and stable dynamical state ( e.g. , rotation ) , or , on the contrary , out of equilibrium ( e.g. , subsequently to a merger ) .    in this paper , we present an updated version of the simulation pipeline . the main improvement is related to the inclusion of thermal emissions from both the ifs and the telescope .",
    "this allowed us to explore a wider parameter space , and especially areas where observations are limited by the thermal emission rather than by the sky background ( e.g. , relatively faint targets in the k band ) .",
    "we also significantly extended the range of morpho - kinematic templates and of physical parameters ( e.g. , radius , mass , and velocity as a function of redshift ) considered in the simulations .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we present our methodology and the pipeline used for simulations . in sect .",
    "3 , we detail the scientific and observational inputs used in the simulations . in sect .",
    "4 , we present the results of the simulations , which are discussed in sect .",
    "a conclusion is drawn in sect 6 . throughout",
    ", we adopt @xmath12 km / s / mpc , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and the @xmath15 magnitude system .",
    "simulations presented in this paper focus on the sub - sample of distant emission line galaxies : due to signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) limitations , absorption line galaxies at z @xmath16 1.5 will more likely be studied using integrated spectroscopy ( see drm science case c10 - 3 `` elt integrated spectroscopy of early - type galaxies at z @xmath2 1 '' ) .",
    "therefore , in the following , only emission line galaxies will be considered and for convenience , we will sometimes use the single word `` galaxies '' to refer to `` emission line galaxies '' .",
    "spatially - resolved kinematics of such galaxies provides a useful test - bed for 3d spectrographs , because it drives the stringent requirements on the snr : while flux is the zero - order moment of an emission line , the velocity and velocity dispersion are derived from the position and the width of emission lines , which are their first and second moments , and higher order moments are always characterised by larger statistical uncertainties .",
    "hence , simulations shall assess the principal scientific goal of spatially - resolved spectroscopy of distant emission line galaxies , focusing on kinematics .",
    "different objectives can be defined depending on the level of accuracy and/or spatial scale one wants to probe ; we defined the following objectives ( dubbed here as `` steps '' ) , ordered by increasing complexity / difficulty :    1 .",
    "simple ( 3d ) detection of emission line galaxies : what stellar mass can be reached at a given snr as a function of redshift , ao system , environmental conditions , etc . ? 2",
    ".   recovery of large scale motions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : what are the conditions under which it is possible to recover the dynamical state of distant galaxies ( e.g. , relaxed rotating disks vs. non - relaxed major mergers ) ? 3 .",
    "recovery of rotation curves ( rc ) : what are the conditions under which it is possible to recover the rotation velocity v@xmath17 ( to derive , dynamical masses or the tully - fisher relation , see , e.g. , @xcite ) or the whole shape of the rc ( for derivation and decomposition in mass profiles , see , e.g. , @xcite ) ? 4 .",
    "recovery of the detailed kinematics : what are the conditions under which it is possible to detect internal structures in distant galaxies , like clumps in distant disks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ?    studying and evaluating in detail",
    "the future achievement and measurement accuracy of an nir integral - field spectrograph on the e - elt in these areas is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "moreover , in addition to the scientific limitations pointed out in the introduction , one has to take into account the fact that technical developments ( both on the telescope and instrument side ) are not advanced enough to allow us to conduct such a detailed study , since several key elements are currently not fully known ( e.g. , the thermal contribution from the telescope , coatings , instrument design ) .",
    "rather , the goal of this paper is to restrict the acceptable underlying parameter space ( see below ) , and identify breaking points on the technical side that might strongly impact the achievable science of an ifs an the e - elt .",
    "however , to put this study on as realistic as possible grounds , an observational proposal was defined prior to simulations .",
    "this program was designed to provide us with an ultimate test of galaxy formation theories .",
    "it is therefore ambitious , with the goal of obtaining spatially - resolved kinematics of about one thousand of galaxies spanning a large range of cosmic time and mass .",
    "current 3d surveys on 8 - 10 m telescopes already allowed us to sample a significant part of the cosmic look - back time , from z=0.4 to z@xmath43 , i.e. , up to @xmath411 gyr ago .",
    "main 3d samples are concentrated around z@xmath40.6 ( see the images sample , @xcite ) and z@xmath42 ( see the sins and osiris samples , @xcite ) , and it is unlikely that current or event future 3d spectrographs on 8 - 10 m telescopes will provide us with large and representative samples beyond z@xmath43 , due to limitations in surface brightness detection , even when fed with adaptive optics .",
    "therefore , we focused on the redshift range 2 - 5.6 , which remains largely unexplored , with the advantage of sharing the z@xmath42 limit with existing data .",
    "the upper limit is driven by the availability of emission lines in the nir window , and corresponds to the [ oii ] emission line getting out the k band .",
    "it is worth emphasising that such a 3d survey is by nature radically different from what is currently done at z@xmath21 .",
    "because of the limited sensitivity of current 3d spectrographs , galaxies are targeted in optimal windows , where the atmospheric absorption is low .",
    "this , combined to the collection of selection criteria used at high - z to pre - select targets with known redshifts ( e.g. , bzk , or lyman - break techniques ) result in samples whose selection functions and representativity have been the subject of a long debate .",
    "the only way to overcome these limitations is to conduct a deep optical - nir imaging and redshift survey with high completeness up to z@xmath45.6 , from which a 3d follow - up on the e - elt will guarantee , _ without any pre - selection _ , the representativity of the resulting sample .    several integral field spectrographs ( ifs ) are currently under study for the e - elt .",
    "the present program is designed for a multi - object ifs , since multiplex is required to reach a significant number of targets .",
    "for example , eagle , the project of multi - integral field spectrograph for the e - elt , would be a well - suited instrument for such a survey @xcite .",
    "however , we want to emphasise that the present paper does not intend to explore the scientific capabilities of this particular instrument , beyond the fact that it is a nir multi - ifu spectrograph .",
    "the end - products of 3d spectrographs are usually data - cubes in fits format .",
    "hence , we have developed a simulation pipeline that produces such mock data .",
    "these simulated data are produced assuming a perfect data reduction process , whose impact has therefore been neglected ( see sect .",
    "data - cubes are simulated using a backward approach of the usual analysis of 3d data . during such an analysis ,",
    "each spaxel is analysed separately in order to extract from each spectrum the continuum and the first moments of emission lines .",
    "one ends up with a set of maps describing the spatial distribution of the continuum and line emissions ( zeroth order moment of the emission line ) , as well as the gas velocity field ( first order moment ) and velocity dispersion map ( second order moment ) .",
    "such maps are routinely derived from fabry - perot observations of local galaxies ( see , e.g , @xcite ) , or can be generated as by - products of hydro - dynamical simulations of local galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using simple rules and empirical relations ,",
    "these maps can be rescaled ( in terms of size and total flux ) to provide a realistic description of distant galaxies ( see sect .",
    "assuming a gaussian shape for all spectra , it is then straightforward to reconstruct a data - cube from such a set of four maps , by `` reversing '' the usual analysis of 3d data .",
    "this allows us to produce a data - cube at high spatial resolution , which can then be degraded at the spatial resolution ( ao psf ) and sampling ( ifu pixel scale ) required for simulating data produced by a given 3d spectrograph . during the process , realistic sky and thermal backgrounds , as well as photon and detector noise",
    "are added .",
    "the pipeline is fully described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simulation pipeline generates @xmath18 data - cubes with individual exposure time of @xmath19 , which are combined by estimating the median of each pixel to simulate several individual realistic exposures .",
    "since we have only included random noise , it is similar to having dithered all of individual exposures and combining them after aligning them spatially and spectrally .",
    "sky frames are evaluated separately ( i.e. , with a different noise realization ) , and then subtracted from each individual science frame , reproducing the usual procedure in both optical and nir spectroscopy .",
    "we list here the fits files generated by the simulation pipeline that are relevant for the present study :    * an ifu data - cube : this is the final product of the simulation , which corresponds to mock observations ; * a total background spectrum ( sky continuum , oh sky lines , and total thermal background ) ; * a thermal background spectrum ; * an snr data - cube , which gives the expected snr within each pixel of the ifu data - cube .",
    "this spectroscopic snr is derived as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the object and sky flux per @xmath19 ( after accounting for atmospheric transmission ) in the spatial position @xmath23 of the data - cube ( in pixels ) , and at the spectral position @xmath24 along the wavelength axis ( in pixels ) . in the following",
    ", the `` maximal snr in the emission line in the pixel @xmath23 '' refers to max@xmath25[@xmath26 , and the `` spatial - mean snr '' refers to the average of this quantity over the intrinsic galaxy diameter , i.e. , the diameter of the galaxy irrespective of what parts of the galaxy are detected .    for each simulation , the main parameters are recorded in the headers of the corresponding fits files .",
    "the simulated ifu data - cubes are then analysed using an automatic data analysis pipeline similar to those generally used to analyse data of high redshift galaxies . during this process ,",
    "each spatial pixel of the simulated data - cube is fitted with a gaussian in wavelength , whose position and width correspond respectively to the velocity and velocity dispersion of the gas in this spatial pixel . only pixels with a kinematic signal to noise ratio @xmath27 of at least three ( see definition below ) were considered to limit uncertainties .",
    "a more detailed description of the process can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analysis pipeline produces the following fits files :    * an emission line flux map ; * a velocity field ; * a velocity dispersion map ; * a map of the kinematic @xmath27 , which is defined as the total flux in the emission line divided by the noise on the continuum @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the number of pixels within the emission line ; * a map of the maximal @xmath30 , i.e. , the @xmath30 at the peak of the emission line within each spaxel of the simulated ifu data - cube . a spatial - mean value is written down into the header ( see above ) .",
    "all input parameters can be separated into two broad categories , namely the `` physical '' parameter space , which includes all parameters defining the distant galaxy ( i.e. , redshift @xmath31 , galaxy diameter , continuum ab magnitude @xmath32 , rest - frame emission line equivalent width @xmath33 , velocity gradient , and morpho - kinematic type ) , and the `` observational '' parameter space , which includes the telescope ( primary mirror m1 and secondary mirror m2 diameters , temperature @xmath34 , and emissivity @xmath35 ) , the instrument ( spectral resolution @xmath36 , ifu pixel size @xmath37 , detector integration time @xmath19 , number of exposures @xmath18 , temperatures @xmath38 and emissivities @xmath39 , ao correction , and global transmission t@xmath40 ) , and the site ( seeing , @xmath41 profile , outer scale of the turbulence @xmath42 , sky brightness and atmospheric transmission ) .    given the very large number of parameters to be investigated , as well as the very large range of values to be explored , it is useful to define a `` reference case '' , around which the parameter space can be explored and compared with .",
    "as such a reference case , we adopted an m@xmath43 galaxy at z=4 observed using moao ( multi - object adaptive optics , see sect .",
    "3.2 ) with a median seeing of 0.8 arcsec . at this redshift",
    ", the [ oii ] emission line is observed in the h - band , where the influence of the thermal background is minimised in comparison with the k - band .",
    "this makes this reference case as independent as possible of the telescope design ( e.g. , number of mirrors ) , environmental conditions ( site selection ) , and instrument characteristics ( e.g. , number of warm mirrors ) , which are not all fully known at present .",
    "this reference case will be used to assess separately the influence of :    * the ao correction for a given set of other observational and physical parameters ; * the observational parameters for a given set of physical parameters and ao correction ; * the physical parameters for a given set of observational parameters ( ao correction included ) .      to decide whether or not the scientific goals have been met , we adopted a pragmatic point of view and defined as a general metric the total observation time of the survey @xmath44 required to achieve the proposal goals , i.e. , observe @xmath3 galaxies more massive than @xmath45 in the redshift range 2 - 5.6 . a high number of galaxies ( @xmath46100 ) is required to allows us to derive statistics over the morpho - kinematic types of galaxies in several redshift and stellar mass bins ( see sect .",
    "we require @xmath47 nights , which roughly corresponds to the total time allocated at eso to large programs per vlt per year ( i.e. , 30% of the available time ) .",
    "therefore , such a survey could reasonably be implemented as a several years effort .",
    "finally , this total time should correspond to snr levels that guarantee to reach at least step ( ii ) for most of galaxies in the survey , and step ( iv ) ( see sect .",
    "2.1 ) for a more limited sub - sample ( to be defined by simulations ) .    from a more practical point of view",
    ", such a survey will be faced with the difficulty that future targets will have to be drawn from a larger parent sample because of selection constraints on , e.g. , avoidance of oh sky lines , which reduces the availability of redshift windows at a 30 - 40% level in h - band ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other technical constrains might be related to , e.g. , the design of instrument setups in terms of spectral bandwidth .",
    "however , the current development of eagle , the project of multi - integral field spectrograph for the e - elt , considers the capability of obtaining the equivalent of large - band filters in terms of spectral bandwidth in a single observational shoot @xcite .",
    "finally , the construction of this parent sample will require substantial observing time from current or future facilities ( e.g. , vlt / hawk - i , jwst / nircam , vista ) .",
    "given that the target density at z@xmath44 is of the order of one per arcmin@xmath48 ( down to @xmath49=25 , see @xcite , defining a parent sample of , say , one thousand of galaxies will require deep imaging in the nir over several square - degrees .",
    "this will be further discussed in sect .",
    "5 .",
    "we conducted a special first run to compare the results of the simulation pipeline with real 3d observations on the vlt of a galaxy at z@xmath42.4 observed by @xcite using sinfoni .",
    "the goal of this run is to use input parameters corresponding to a real observed case and assess whether or not the simulation pipeline is able to produce a data - cube with the same quality , quantified using the median @xmath27 ( see definition in sect .",
    "2.3 ) . for the z@xmath42.4 galaxy observed with sinfoni , the corresponding input parameters are : galaxy diameter of 0.8 arcsec , k=21.47 , ew@xmath50(h@xmath51)=140 , integration time t@xmath52=6 hr , pixel size of 50@xmath9100 mas@xmath48 , psf with fwhm=150 milli - arcsec ( mas ) , temperature of the telescope and instrument of 287k ( vlt ) , emissivity of the telescope of 6% ( cassegrain focus ) , emissivity of sinfoni of 15% .",
    "we took care of mimicking the sinfoni data reduction procedure by interpolating pixels from the physical 50@xmath9100 mas@xmath48 spatial scale down to the 50@xmath950 mas@xmath48 final scale , and smoothing the data - cube to a resolution of 190 mas @xcite .",
    "the results of this validation run are shown in fig .",
    "[ sinfoni ] and demonstrate that , given a complete set of observational and physical parameters , simulations can produce data - cubes quantitatively similar to real observations .",
    "moreover , the similarity between the observed velocity field and velocity dispersion map ( see first panel in fig . [ sinfoni ] ) and those produced by the automatic analysis pipeline ( see second panel ) shows that the automatic analysis pipeline can be used safely and does not add too much uncertainty on the derived kinematics compared to a more careful visual examination and fitting of the data - cube .",
    "scientific inputs are needed in order to ( 1 ) provide the simulation pipeline with morpho - kinematic templates and ( 2 ) re - scale these templates as a function of realistic distant galaxy sizes , fluxes , and velocity gradients .",
    "a global flowchart of the rescaling procedure is shown in fig .",
    "[ rescaling ] , while specific details are given below .",
    "* morpho - kinematic templates : * table [ tabtempl ] summarises the main properties of the high resolution templates used for the simulations , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ templates ] and [ templates2 ] .",
    "these templates were obtained from both real observations ( fabry - perot interferometry of local galaxies , see @xcite and @xcite ) , and hydro - dynamical simulations of galaxies ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    [",

    "we have conducted simulations of the `` physics and mass assembly of galaxies out of z@xmath46 '' science case for the e - elt , exploring a wide range of observational and physical parameters .",
    "we have defined figures of merit for this science case despite the inherent complexity of the science goals , derived empirical scaling relations between the signal - to - noise ratio of kinematic and intensity maps and the main telescope and instrument parameters , as well as a relation between the limit in stellar mass that can be reached for a given signal - to - noise ratio as a function of redshift .",
    "we specifically investigated the impact of ao performance on the science goal .",

    "<S> one of the main science goal of the future european extremely large telescope will be to understand the mass assembly process in galaxies as a function of cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> to this aim , a multi - object , ao - assisted integral field spectrograph will be required to map the physical and chemical properties of very distant galaxies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the ability of such an instrument to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy of a large sample of massive ( @xmath0 ) galaxies at @xmath1 , selected from future large area optical - near ir surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we produced a set of about one thousand numerical simulations of 3d observations using reasonable assumptions about the site , telescope , and instrument , and about the physics of distant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these data - cubes were analysed as real data to produce realistic kinematic measurements of very distant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we then studied how sensible the scientific goals are to the observational ( i.e. , site- , telescope- , and instrument - related ) and physical ( i.e. , galaxy - related ) parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we specifically investigated the impact of ao performance on the science goal . </S>",
    "<S> we did not identify any breaking points with respect to the parameters ( e.g. , the telescope diameter ) , with the exception of the telescope thermal background , which strongly limits the performance in the highest ( z@xmath25 ) redshift bin . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a survey of @xmath3 galaxies that fulfil the range of science goals can be achieved with a @xmath490 nights program on the e - elt , provided a multiplex capability @xmath5 .    </S>",
