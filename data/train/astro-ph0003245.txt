    "the obscuration due to dust and the high stellar density in our galaxy varies from place to place within the milky way .",
    "overall , it blocks our optical view of the extragalactic universe over @xmath420% of the sky , somewhat less in the infrared .",
    "this  zone of avoidance \" ( zoa ) was recognized even before the nature of the spiral nebulae themselves was understood .",
    "this sky coverage limitation does not pose a problem for the study of galaxies themselves , as there is no reason to believe that the population of obscured galaxies should differ from those in optically unobscured regions . however , to understand the local group s motion requires mapping the surrounding mass inhomogeneity , measured in practice by galaxy over- and under - densities , across the entire sky .",
    "in particular , the lack of a full census of nearby , hidden galaxies is troublesome , since the local galaxies should play a significant role in the milky way s motion with respect to the microwave background ( kraan - korteweg 1993 ) .    the zoa has been successfully narrowed by deep searches in the optical and infrared ( see kraan - korteweg & woudt 1999 for a comprehensive review of the various efforts ) .",
    "however , optical searches fail where the extinction exceeds 4 - 5 magnitudes , within about @xmath9 of the galactic plane .",
    "near - infrared surveys , e.g. 2mass ( skrutskie 1997 ) and denis ( epchtein 1997 ) , will eventually produce catalogs of galaxies closer to the plane than is possible with optical searches , but they do not recover the most heavily obscured galaxies , or galaxies of low surface brightness ( schrder , kraan - korteweg , & mamon 1999 ) .",
    "far - infrared surveys become confusion limited by galactic sources at low latitudes , and the remaining zoa still covers @xmath10 of the sky .",
    "galaxies which contain can be found in the regions of thickest obscuration and ir confusion .",
    "the technique was pioneered over a decade ago by kerr & henning ( 1987 ) who showed through a small , pilot survey that completely optically - hidden galaxies could be readily uncovered through the detection of their 21-cm emission . since then , a spatially complete survey for spirals out to 4000 has been conducted over the northern zoa ( @xmath11 , @xmath1  @xmath2  5@xmath3 ; rms noise 40 mjy beam@xmath12 ) with the 25  m dwingeloo telescope ( henning 1998 , rivers 1999 ) .",
    "the survey uncovered no massive , ",
    "type galaxy in the zoa , indeed the nearest , previously unknown galaxy revealed by the survey was dwingeloo 1 , a likely member of the ic342/maffei group ( kraan - korteweg 1994 ) .",
    "the census for nearby , -bearing galaxies in the northern zoa is complete , at least for those galaxies whose redshifts or blueshifts are sufficient to separate their signals from galactic 21-cm emission , at @xmath13  @xmath6  @xmath4100 .",
    "we report here on a somewhat deeper survey ( rms noise 15 mjy beam@xmath12 ) for galaxies in the southern zoa , conducted with the new multibeam receiver on the 64  m parkes radiotelescope .",
    "the angular coverage ( @xmath0 , @xmath1  @xmath2  5@xmath3 ) completes the survey of the great circle of the zoa for relatively nearby , dynamically important hi galaxies . the present survey discussed here ( the  shallow survey \" ) represents the first stage of an ongoing deeper search of the area with the multibeam system . the shallow survey is comprised of the first two scans of a planned 25 scans of the southern zoa , estimated to be completed in mid-2000 .",
    "( this full sensitivity survey will be sensitive to spirals to a redshift of @xmath4 10,000 ) .",
    "in addition to the astronomical motivation outlined above , the shallow survey serves as a testbed of techniques for the full sensitivity survey .    an intermediate - depth survey consisting of four scans of the region @xmath14",
    "; @xmath1  @xmath2  5@xmath3 , has been conducted ( juraszek 2000 ) .",
    "this region is of particular interest as it contains the predicted position of the core of the great attractor ( kolatt , dekel , & lahav 1995 ) .    in   2 , the observations and data reduction will be described .",
    "the search method and galaxy parametrization procedure will be outlined in   3 .",
    "the resulting catalog is presented in ",
    "discussion of the galaxy distribution at low galactic latitudes , the mass function derived for the sample , and predictions for the full sensitivity survey are contained in ",
    "the observations for the survey commenced on 1997 march 22 and were made by scanning the parkes multibeam receiver in strips of constant galactic latitude , each of length 8 .",
    "the parkes receiver has 13 independent beams , each with two orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "the receiver rotation was fixed ( with respect to the telescope which has an alt - az mount ) during each scan such that the rotation angle of the receiver , relative to the scan direction , was 15   at the mid - point of the scan .",
    "this meant that the beams rotated on the sky during each scan .",
    "nevertheless , there was sufficient overlap to obtain complete sampling of the entire southern plane , with approximately uniform sensitivity ( see staveley - smith 1997 ) .",
    "the absence of continuous receiver rotation and axial focussing helped ensure maximum baseline stability .",
    "the telescope scan rate was 1 degree / min , so each scan took 8 min to complete .",
    "the observations were done in parallel with the parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) and a deeper zoa survey ( see http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/multibeam/ for current information regarding these surveys ) .",
    "most observations for the shallow survey were completed by 1997 september 4 , although some regions were re - scanned as recently as 1999 august 28 , because of earlier pointing problems in a few fields .",
    "the footprint of the multibeam receiver on the sky is @xmath15 , so that each scan maps out an @xmath16 strip of longitude . to obtain full coverage of the southern zoa",
    ", 34 scans were made between galactic latitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 at each of 23 separate central longitudes from 216   to 32 .",
    "the observing parameters and the area mapped is summarized in table 1 . in total 782 scans , or @xmath19 hrs of data , were obtained for the 1840 deg@xmath20 comprising the survey region .",
    "this corresponds to an integration time , when integrated over all 13 beams , of 200 s beam@xmath12 , where the beam size , after gridding , has been taken to be 155 .",
    "( the full - sensitivity southern zoa survey will comprise 425 scans at each longitude , or approximately 1300 hrs of integration time ) .",
    "the average system temperature of the multibeam receiver during the observations was @xmath21 k. the average rms noise after hanning smoothing and away from strong continuum and line sources was 15 mjy beam@xmath12 .",
    "the velocity range of the observations was @xmath22 to 12700 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the channel spacing was 13.2 km  s@xmath12 and the resolution , after hanning smoothing , was 27.0 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the spectral data were bandpass - corrected , smoothed and doppler - corrected using aips++ livedata ( barnes 1998 ) . for each beam and polarization ,",
    "a template bandpass was calculated by taking the median of the surrounding data with @xmath23 and @xmath24 s. the spectral data were then gridded into 23 cubes , each of size 10   in longitude by 8   in latitude with a pixel size of 4  .",
    "each output pixel consists of the median of approximately 30 independent ( 5 s ) spectra which lie within a radius of 6   of the center of the pixel .",
    "the use of the median statistic successfully removes the effect of outlyers , so that interference and bad data were rejected with good efficiency without manual editing of all spectra ( which number about @xmath25 for the shallow survey ) . for more details , see barnes ( 2000 ) .",

    "the cubes were hanning smoothed , and each of the 23 smoothed data cubes was searched by eye using the visualization tool karma kview ( gooch 1995 ) .",

    "the eye / brain system is still far more effective for finding the signals ) .",
    "first , right ascension  velocity planes were examined , and candidates noted .",
    "the selection criterion was a minimum peak flux density of @xmath4  75 mjy ( 5@xmath29 ) , with emission extended over two or more channels , or a minimum flux integral of @xmath4  4 jy .",
    "the candidates were then checked at the corresponding positions in right ascension  declination planes .",
    "candidates which were created by interference or increased noise at the edges of fields were culled .",
    "finally , the one - dimensional profile , flux density versus velocity , was created for each source , and its shape was checked for good sense , since galaxies tend to have 2-horned , flat - topped , or gaussian profiles .    to measure central positions and flux integrals ,",
    "a zeroth moment map was first made by integrating the cubes in the full velocity range occupied by each galaxy . for most galaxies , which were unresolved ,",
    "a gaussian with the same fwhp diameter as the gridded telescope beam ( 155 ) and a dc offset were simultaneously fitted to each zeroth moment map .",
    "five galaxies were found to be significantly extended , and were fitted with gaussians of arbitrary width .",
    "the positional accuracy is 2 - 3 , depending on the s / n ratio , and the flux integral uncertainty is @xmath30% .    using the best - fit position , spectra",
    "were then extracted from the cubes using the miriad task mbspect ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) . for the unresolved galaxies ,",
    "this spectrum is a weighted average , with the weight dependent on the distance of each pixel from the fitted position . for resolved galaxies ,",
    "the spectrum is spatially integrated across the galaxy .",
    "velocity widths were then measured at the 20% and 50% levels ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , relative to the peak signal , using a width - maximizing algorithm ( lewis 1983 ) . in order to correct for the relatively coarse velocity resolution ( 27 km s@xmath12 ) of the hanning - smoothed spectra , downward corrections of 21 km s@xmath12 and 14 km s@xmath12",
    "were applied to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "a central velocity was also measured from the 50% values .",
    "all velocities quoted are in the optical ( @xmath33 ) convention .",
    "the shallow survey detected 110 galaxies , whose parameters are listed in table 2 , and whose profiles are shown in figure 1 .    in table 2 , columns contain the following information :    column 1a : source name ;    column 1b : indicates if the galaxy has an optical or ir counterpart within 6 arcmin listed in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . if the entry is followed by a colon , there is no redshift given in ned for the object , or , for iras 13413 - 6525 ( hizss 083 ) and eso 223-g012 ( hizss 095 ) , the hi redshift is just outside of the uncertainty indicated in ned ;    columns 2a & 2b : equatorial coordinates ( j2000 ) of the fitted position ;    columns 3a & 3b : galactic coordinates ;    column 4 : hi flux integral ;    column 5 : heliocentric velocity ( @xmath33 ) , the midpoint at 50% of the profile s peak flux density ;    columns 6 & 7 : velocity width at 50% of peak , and at 20% of peak flux density ;    column 8 : distance to the galaxy correcting the velocity to the local group frame , and taking _",

    "29 have optical counterparts listed in ned with matching redshifts .",
    "two more have counterparts in ned with redshifts just outside the quoted accuracy . a further 12",
    "have a cataloged galaxy within 6 arcmin of the hi position , but with no redshift information .",
    "the extinction at the positions of each galaxy was estimated from the dirbe / iras maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that these maps are not calibrated this close to the galactic plane , so extinction measurements are somewhat uncertain .",
    "however , as expected , the extinction is measured to be higher at the positions of the uncataloged galaxies : the median a@xmath35 for the cataloged galaxies is 2.9 mag , versus 5.7 at the positions of the uncataloged objects .",
    "an intermediate - depth survey conducted with the multibeam system in a similar way , but with four scans compared to the two discussed here , of the region @xmath14 ; @xmath1  @xmath2  5@xmath3 , detected 42 galaxies ( juraszek 2000 ) .",
    "the intermediate - depth cubes and the shallow survey cubes were searched independently .",
    "all 24 of the shallow survey galaxies in this longitude range were recovered by juraszek , as they should have been , owing to their @xmath36 improved sensitivity .",
    "of the 18 other galaxies found by this deeper survey , 14 fell well below the selection criteria of the shallow survey .",
    "there were four , however , which juraszek determined to have peak fluxes just at or above the shallow survey flux density cutoff ( j1414 - 62 , j1417 - 55 , j1526 - 51 , and j1612 - 56 ; cf .",
    "fig 2 . in juraszek ) .",
    "two of these , j1414 - 62 and j1612 - 56 , were noted as possible detections in the course of examining the shallow survey cubes , but it was felt they were not quite secure enough for inclusion in the present catalog , the philosophy being that false detections are extremely undesirable .",
    "the other two objects were missed .",
    "one , j1417 - 55 , while determined to be a broad - profiled galaxy in the intermediate - depth survey , was not recognized as a galaxy by the present work , since only one horn of the profile exceeds 75 mjy , and so appears as a random spike , too narrow for inclusion in this sample .",
    "the other , j1526 - 51 , peaks above 100 mjy in the intermediate - depth survey , but has a linewidth of only w@xmath37 = 21 , and did not satisfy the condition of appearing in at least two channels .",
    "thus the stated selection criteria of the shallow survey are consistent with the results of the intermediate - depth survey in this region .    as a check on the accuracy of the measured parameters , the 21-cm properties of hizss 005 ( iras 07112 - 0746 ) , hizss 008 ( iras 07232 - 2422 ) , hizss 018 ( iras 07395 - 2224 ) , hizss 024 ( eso 493-g016 ) , hizss 027 ( eso 430-g001 ) , hizss 028 ( eso 561-g002 ) , hizss 029 ( eso 494-g007 ) , hizss 032 ( eso 494-g026 ) , hizss 034 ( eso 430-g020 ) , hizss",

    "five of the 110 galaxies are extended objects at the multibeam resolution , and of these , three were previously cataloged : circinus , eso 494-g026 , and iras 15109 - 5248 .",
    "21-cm follow - up synthesis mapping has been done for iras 15109 - 5248 and the two uncataloged , extended objects , hizss 097 and hizss 102 by staveley - smith ( 1998 ) .",
    "rotation curve analysis indicates the iras galaxy is a massive disk system , estimated m@xmath48 = 6  @xmath49 10@xmath50 m@xmath51 .",
    "the other two are moderate to low mass systems , which under the higher resolution scrutiny of the synthesis observations ( synthesized beam fwhm @xmath4 2.2 - 4.5 arcmin ) were seen to break up into apparently interacting systems of low column density .",
    "synthesis observations of all of the shallow survey detections using the australia telescope compact array and the nrao very large array have been completed or are planned .",
    "identifications on the currently available strips of the southern sky nir survey denis ( deep nir southern sky survey ; epchtein 1997 ) show that many of the shallow survey sources are visible on the nir images ( schrder , kraan - korteweg , & mamon 1999 ; schrder in prep . ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution on the sky of the shallow survey detections , and galaxies from the literature within a redshift of 4000 .",
    "the shallow survey now fills in the southern zoa within about 40 mpc for the first time , with minimal dependence of detection - rate on galactic latitude ( fig .",
    "the local void is clearly evident in the distribution of both the optically - cataloged objects , and the shallow survey detections .",
    "it is also apparent in figure 4 , the longitude - velocity distribution of the hi detected objects .",
    "the three shallow survey objects on the border of the local void at l @xmath4 30@xmath3 all have redshifts @xmath4 1500 , consistent with their being members of the group proposed by roman ( 1998 ) .",
    "two of these galaxies lie within the survey boundary of the dwingeloo obscured galaxies survey , and were also detected by this survey ( rivers , henning , & kraan - korteweg 1999 ) .",
    "the most obvious overdensity of the low latitude galaxies apparent in figure 2 occurs at l @xmath4 245@xmath3 .",
    "figure 4 reveals the overdensity is caused by two groupings of galaxies , at ( l , v ) @xmath4 ( 245@xmath3 , 800 ) and ( l , v ) @xmath4 ( 245@xmath3 , 1500 ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the location of the moderately obscured , nearby cluster in puppis ( l , b , v ) @xmath4 ( 245@xmath3 , 0@xmath3 , 1500 ) ( kraan - korteweg & huchtmeier 1992 ) .",
    "this overdensity of galaxies was deduced by scharf ( 1992 ) through a spherical harmonic analysis of iras galaxies .",
    "the nearer group was also recovered by kraan - korteweg & huchtmeier ( 1992 ) .",
    "there is no evidence of any other nearby , unrecognized clusters of galaxies in the survey region . except near the galactic center where continuum emission decreased the sensitivity of the survey somewhat , the survey was uniformly sensitive to spirals with m@xmath46 = @xmath52 m@xmath45 at 1500 ( h@xmath53 = 75 mpc@xmath12 ) across the entire southern zoa , so any hidden overdensities within this redshift range should have been easily detected .",
    "structures at v @xmath4 4000 are not well probed by this survey , however we can see the relative overdensity of galaxies toward the general great attractor region , and galaxy underdensity behind the puppis cluster , broadly consistent with the theoretical mass density reconstructions of kolatt , dekel , & lahav ( 1995 ) and webster , lahav , & fisher ( 1997 ) .",
    "the deep survey should definitively confirm or refute the predictions of these and other mass density reconstructions in the zoa .      to determine the number density of galaxies as a function of mass ( the mass function )",
    ", the sensitivity of the survey must be carefully determined to be able to apply appropriate volume corrections .",
    "near strong continuum sources , galaxies which would otherwise be detected are hidden in the increased noise . over the search area , @xmath0 , @xmath1  @xmath2  5@xmath3",
    ", 7.7% of the data were disturbed by strong continuum emission , and had rms noise fluctuations a factor of three or more above the quoted sensitivity of 15 mjy . in the volume correction calculations",
    ", we take the survey area to be 92.3% of the area covered by the telescope .",
    "the galaxy selection function for the shallow survey is not based simply on peak flux , but is determined empirically to involve both total flux and linewidth in the following way : @xmath54 s dv",
    "@xmath49 w@xmath55 @xmath56 0.3 .",
    "schneider , spitzak , & rosenberg ( 1998 ) find a very similar functional form for the completeness limit of two previous blind 21-cm surveys done at arecibo , @xmath54 s dv @xmath49 w@xmath57 . with this description , the maximum volume in which each galaxy could be detected is calculated .",
    "the average value of v / v@xmath58 = 0.58 , is quite close to the theoretical value of 1/2 for a correctly determined completeness .",
    "the resulting number density of masses with each galaxy weighted by the inverse of its maximum detectable volume is shown in figure 5 .",
    "this mass function is well fit by a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) with parameters @xmath5 = 1.51 @xmath6 0.12 , @xmath7 = 0.006 @xmath6 0.003 , and log m@xmath8 = 9.7 @xmath6 0.10 . note that the schechter function was not used as an _ a priori _ assumption of the shape of the mass function .",
    "the low - mass slope is significantly steeper than the @xmath5 = 1.20 suggested by zwaan ( 1997 ) .",
    "the densities at the lowest mass bins are consistent with the higher densities found by schneider , spitzak , & rosenberg ( 1998 ) .",
    "the main difficulty remains small number statistics , with the three lowest mass bins of figure 5 containing a total of six galaxies . with the increased search volume of the hipass and full sensitivity zoa surveys , the statistical robustness of the mass function parametrization",
    "will be improved .",
    "we now estimate how many galaxies should be uncovered by the full sensitivity zoa survey , to be completed in the year 2000 .",
    "the deep survey will consist of 435 scans at each longitude , compared with the 34 of the shallow survey .",
    "this factor of 12.5 increase in integration time will lead to a @xmath59 = 3.5 improvement in sensitivity . for",
    "a galaxy of a given m@xmath46 and velocity linewidth , the distance to which it could be detected will increase by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the volume increase of the deep survey over the shallow survey is about a factor of 6.5 , leading to a rough estimate of @xmath61 galaxies to be detected by the deep survey .",
    "indeed , a portion of the deep survey is completed , and the four data cubes in the region of the supposed great attractor have been inspected , and about 300 galaxy candidates noted ( s. juraszek , private communication ) .",
    "extrapolation over the full spatial extent of the survey leads to an estimate of about 1700 galaxies .",
    "however , this region of space contains a significant overdensity of galaxies , and much of the final survey volume will contain the local void , so the total tally may be closer to 1000 galaxies .",
    "efforts are underway to develop software tools which model and remove strong continuum sources from the data , which should decrease the effective noise even further , increasing the survey sensitivity and the number of detected objects .",
    "we thank the hipass team ( pi : rachel webster ) for assisting with the observing , and the staff at parkes for their support .",
    "we also acknowledge the aips++ group for the development of the basis of the data reduction software and some of the observing software .",
