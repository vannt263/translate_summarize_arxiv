    "this paper concerns a sudden accidental / deliberate release of contaminant in a building that may cause serious health hazards , including death , to the occupants if exposed over a prolonged period of time .",
    "although released locally , the contaminant diffuses rapidly through flow paths like doors , windows and leakages , affecting occupants throughout the building .",
