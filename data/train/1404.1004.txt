    "let @xmath10 be a closed symplectic manifold and @xmath11 the real oriented compact surface with boundary obtained by removing an open disc from the real compact surface without boundary of genus @xmath12 .",
    "so , in other terms , @xmath11 is obtained by attaching @xmath12 handles to the closed unit disk .",
    "now let @xmath13 be a hamiltonian fibration with fiber @xmath10 and base @xmath11 .",
    "this means that @xmath14 is a smooth fibration with fiber @xmath7 over @xmath11 and structure group the group of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms @xmath15 of @xmath7 , and the connection defined by @xmath16 is compatible with this structure group ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is equivalent to asking that the symplectic form @xmath17 on @xmath14 be ruled ( which means that @xmath17 restricts on each fiber to a symplectic form isotopic to @xmath18 ) with monodromy around any loop of the base belonging to @xmath4 .",
    "recall that @xmath4 is simple , so the subgroup generated by all products of commutators in @xmath4 must be the whole group , which means that every hamiltonian diffeomorphism of @xmath7 can be written as a product of commutators .",
    "the _ commutator length _ of @xmath19 is by definition the smallest @xmath2 such that @xmath3 can be written as a product @xmath20 \\ldots [ \\phi_k , \\psi_k ] $ ] of @xmath2 commutators .",
    "now let @xmath21 be a ruled symplectic manifold with hamiltonian monodromies . because @xmath17 is non - degenerate on the fibers , the kernel @xmath22 of the restriction @xmath23 of @xmath17 to the boundary @xmath24 is transversal to the fibers of the projection @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 is a base point belonging to @xmath27 , the monodromy of @xmath22 round @xmath27 defines a symplectic diffeomorphism of @xmath28 which is hamiltonian by hypothesis .",
    "conversely , any hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath3 of @xmath29 can be obtained as monodromy of a ruled symplectic fibration @xmath13 .",
    "this can be easily seen by first representing @xmath3 as monodromy of a ruled @xmath10-fibration @xmath30 over @xmath31 , then by trivialising @xmath30 over a small neighbourhood @xmath32 of an interior point @xmath33 of @xmath31 and by replacing finally @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "we define the @xmath36-_area _ @xmath37 as the infimum of the quotient @xmath38 when @xmath30 runs over all hamiltonian fibrations @xmath39 whose monodromies round @xmath27 equal @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath40 as @xmath41 , which means filling @xmath42 from the other side with a copy of @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we set : @xmath44 it is easy to see that @xmath45 is less or equal to the positive hofer norm of @xmath3 ( see @xcite for details on the hofer norm ) .    the first result of this article is the following :    [ thm : theorem1 ] if @xmath3 is a product of @xmath2 commutators @xmath46 \\ldots [ \\phi_k , \\psi_k]$ ] , then @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "actually , we will prove more .",
    "let us denote by @xmath49 the subset of @xmath4 of all products of @xmath2 commutators of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms . by convention",
    ", @xmath50 contains only the identity .",
    "then obviously @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the following theorem holds :    [ thm : theorem2 ] for all @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the infimum over @xmath56 of @xmath57 and where @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "the first theorem is clearly a corollary of the second one",
    ". it will therefore be enough to establish the latter one .",
    "note that the positive 0-area appearing in the right hand side of the above theorem is smaller or equal to the positive hofer norm @xmath59 .",
    "thus we get the following corollary that relates our @xmath12-area to the positive hofer norm :    for all @xmath53 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the infimum over @xmath56 of @xmath62 and where @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "it is clear that the positive g - area is far from being a norm on the group of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms .",
    "however , the natural object to consider is the following polynomial , that we call the _ positive total hofer norm _ defined by : @xmath64 we define in a similar way the total negative norm .",
    "let us denote by @xmath65 the operation on polynomials obtained from the ordinary product by replacing in each coefficient the sum by the minimum and the product by the sum .",
    "explicitely , set @xmath66 where @xmath67    for any @xmath68 , @xmath69    let @xmath53 , and consider by abuse of notation @xmath70 the application assigning to each integer @xmath71 the coefficient @xmath72 .",
    "then @xmath73 is evidently a non - negative and non - increasing application .",
    "the following question is the principal conjecture concerning the behaviour of @xmath12-areas .    for all @xmath53 , the application @xmath70 is convex , that is to say : for all @xmath74 , @xmath75    before giving the proofs of our theorems below , let us examine the infinitesimal version of these results .",
    "we have seen that , since the group of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold @xmath1 is simple , any hamiltonian diffeomorphism of @xmath7 can be written as a product of a finite number of commutators .",
    "moreover we show in the above theorem that the @xmath36-area of a hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath3 can be regarded as the obstruction to writing @xmath3 as a product of @xmath12 commutators .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there exist _ infinitesimal versions _ of these results and constructions .",
    "first of all note that , by a well known theorem due to lichnerowicz ( and also to calabi and rosenfeld ) ( see theorem 1.4.3 in @xcite ) the lie algebra of hamiltonian vector fields is perfect , so any hamiltonian vector field can be written as a linear combination of lie brackets of hamiltonian vector fields .",
    "therefore it is natural to ask +   + * question : * _ can one define for every @xmath76 an invariant for hamiltonian vector fields which can be interpreted as the obstruction to writing the given vector field as a linear combination of @xmath2 lie brackets of hamiltonian vector fields ? _ + it is convenient to replace hamiltonian vector fields by smooth functions ( modulo constants ) using the correspondence @xmath77 , and the lie bracket by the poisson bracket .",
    "the two questions above have obvious reformulations in terms of hamiltonians .",
    "we believe that the first step in studying these questions is to describe explicitly the cone of _ infinitesimal commutators _ @xmath78 in @xmath79 , but we realized that this question is already quite difficult . in sect .",
    "3 we will make progress in this direction which , although modest , shows that the problem is interesting and difficult : we will fix a morse function @xmath3 ( satisfying a weak genericity condition ) on a closed symplectic surface @xmath1 and we will describe explicitly the space of functions @xmath80 which can be written under the form @xmath81 ( or , equivalently , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath3 ) with @xmath84 .    the referee kindly informed us that our problem is often called in the literature `` the cohomological equation for flows '' and there exists an ample literature dedicated to this problem for an interesting class of hamiltonian vector fields on higher dimensional manifolds , for instance for hamiltonian fields defining anosov flows . the so called livsic theory ( see @xcite ) deals with this problem .",
    "a special example of such a flow is the geodesic flow on a hyperbolic surface , which has been investigated by many authors ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "further important results dedicated to livsic s cohomological equation concern",

    "we glue together the @xmath2 fibrations by first glueing the base near the base point and then by identifying the corresponding fibers over a small neighbourhood of @xmath118 where the fibrations are trivial .",
    "this construction shows that each handle can be used to produce , and therefore to kill , a commutator .    to prove theorem[thm : theorem2 ]",
    ", we must find for each @xmath122 and @xmath123 , a fibration @xmath124 whose monodromy is @xmath3 and whose area is bounded above by @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath126 be a fibration whose area is bounded above by @xmath127 and whose monodromy is equal to @xmath128 .",
    "this exists by the definition of the @xmath129-distance between @xmath3 and @xmath130 .",
    "since @xmath130 belongs to @xmath49 , there is also a fibration @xmath131 of area bounded above by @xmath132 and monodromy @xmath130 .",
    "the connected sum of both fibrations @xmath133 and @xmath134 near the base point @xmath118 of the boundary gives a fibration @xmath14 over @xmath135 of area bounded above by @xmath125 with monodromy @xmath136 .",
    "this completes the proofs of theorems  [ thm : theorem1 ] and [ thm : theorem2 ] .",
    "let us fix an area form @xmath103 of total area 1 on the surface @xmath43 .",
    "since a surface with boundary is homotopy equivalent to its 1-skeleton and the structure group @xmath137 is connected , all our hamiltonian fibrations are topologically trivial .",
    "this means that the ( relative , modulo the boundaries ) cohomology classes of the forms are related as follows :    @xmath138 = [ \\pi_1^ * \\omega ] + \\tau [ \\pi_2^ * \\sigma]\\ ] ] for some real positive @xmath139 , where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the projections of @xmath14 to @xmath7 and @xmath43 respectively under a trivialization of the fibration .",
    "thus    @xmath142^{n+1}= \\tau \\int_p [ \\omega]^n [ \\sigma],\\ ] ] @xmath143^n\\ ] ] and the ratio @xmath144 is @xmath139 .    in other words ,",
    "our @xmath36 area is the infimum of all positive @xmath139 for which one can find a ruled symplectic form @xmath16 on p representing the class @xmath145+\\tau [ \\sigma]$ ] and having the prescribed holonomy over the boundary .",
    "now @xmath146 is more or less the notion of @xmath147 appearing in entov s paper @xcite in section 5 ( its analog for hamiltonian fibrations over @xmath148 had appeared before in polterovich s papers cited there ) .",
    "one of the main differences with our setup is that we work with the group @xmath149 while in entov s paper , @xmath147 is defined for elements of the universal cover of @xmath149 .",
    "then proposition 5.0.9 in entov s paper ( with @xmath150 ) , translated to our setup and proved by the same methods as in polterovich s previous papers for the case of fibrations over @xmath148 , would say that : +   + @xmath151 _ the hofer distance from @xmath152 to the set of elements of @xmath15 which are products of at most @xmath12 commutators . _ + this is weaker than our theorem 1.2 : indeed in our theorem , we distinguish between the positive and negative hofer norm , yielding a finer result .",
    "in fact , our proof is completely different from entov - polterovich .",
