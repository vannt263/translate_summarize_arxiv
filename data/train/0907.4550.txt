    "mode - locked trains of pulses , or frequency combs , have at the same time the coherence properties of c.w",
    ". lasers and the high peak powers of pulsed lasers .",
    "they are potentially perfect tools for generating non - classical states of light , as they are are at the same time high quality light sources , free of excess noise , and intense sources able to induce strong nonlinear effects , and therefore to generate strongly non - classical states of light , such as squeezed or quadrature - entangled states .",
    "frequency combs have been used in many quantum optics experiments , and have efficiently produced non classical light , either in @xmath0 grangier , manipspopo6,serkland or @xmath1 watanabe , rosenbluh , friberg , schmitt , krylov , hirosawa , sharping , fiorentino media , but so far in a single - pass configuration in the nonlinear medium . in this configuration , one needs very high peak powers , and the system loses somehow its potential high quality in terms of pulse to pulse coherence and transverse profile . mode locked lasers have also been used to efficiently generate squeezed states in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the system has the drawback of generating non - minimal states states of light , because of the excess noise due to brillouin scattering in the fiber .",
    "we have recently proposed @xcite to use synchronous optical cavities to recirculate the light in the nonlinear medium , thus enhancing further the nonlinear effects and imposing the cavity mode structure to the generated non - classical field .",
    "this can be done by building  synchronously pumped opos \" or spopos . in a spopo",
    "the cavity round - trip time is equal to the delay between successive pulses of the pumping mode - locked laser , so that the effect of the successive intense pump pulses add coherently , thus reducing considerably its oscillation threshold . in @xcite ,",
    "a large squeezing effect was predicted in some  supermodes \" , which are well defined linear combinations of signal modes of different frequency , but not studied in detail . in the time domain these supermodes correspond to trains of pulses of different waveforms , orthogonal each other .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to precise the quantum model used to predict the effects and to investigate in a detailed way , through analytical or numerical methods , the potentialities of the system in realistic situations    spopos have already been implemented as efficient sources of tunable ultra - short pulses manipspopo0,manipspopo1,manipspopo2,manipspopo3,manipspopo4,manipspopo5 their temporal properties have been theoretically investigated theoryspopo1,theoryspopo3,theoryspopo4 , and actively mode - locking of opos has been recently achieved @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of a pulsed field in terms of a basis of normal modes , similar to the supermodes we consider in this paper , has been introduced in different contexts for a complete quantum characterization of either the pulsed squeezed light generated by parametric down conversion @xcite or solitons in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "such approaches are strongly connected with the schmidt decomposition of two - photon states for the characterization of pairwise entanglement huang1996,law2000 and the bloch - messiah reduction of any optical circuit characterized by a linear input - output relation @xcite . in this context menicucci _",
    "@xcite proposed optical frequency combs as scalable resources for quantum computation .    the article is organized as follows : we present first the model that we will use .",
    "the system turns out to be characterized by a real and symmetric matrix @xmath2 , which contains all the information about the effective nonlinear interaction .",
    "the eigensystem of @xmath2 is thus of special relevance and is studied in section iii , where the spopo threshold and several general properties of the spectrum of @xmath2 are addressed .",
    "an analytical approximation to the diagonalization is also given that allows a better insight into the general trends as parameters are varied .",
    "in section iv it is shown that the introduced eigenmodes or supermodes are squeezed , the corresponding eigenvalues determining the amount of squeezing , which can be measured in a balanced homodyne detection experiment that uses as the local oscillator ( lo ) a field with the same spectrum as the desired supermode . in section",
    "v one then studies the squeezing properties of spopos in two realistic cases , corresponding to bibo and knbo@xmath3 crystals , using an appropriate scaling property of the diagonalization problem .",
    "finally , an appendix details the case of the singly resonant spopo .",
    "we consider quasi - degenerate collinear type i interaction , by means of which the pumping frequency comb , at frequencies around @xmath4 , is converted by a nonlinear @xmath5 crystal into multimode signal radiation at frequencies around @xmath6 , and vice - versa , where @xmath7 and @xmath6 are the two frequencies at which perfect phase matching occurs .",
    "this implies that one has @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the crystal refractive index .",
    "the nonlinear crystal is placed inside a high finesse optical cavity of length @xmath10 , which is assumed to be dispersion compensated by intracavity dispersive elements , so that all cavity modes around the frequency @xmath6 are equally spaced by a common free spectral range @xmath11 , which is made equal to that of the pumping laser , thus warranting the synchronization of the pump to the opo cavity .",
    "this ensures that the pulse - to - pulse delay of the pump beam coincides with the cavity round - trip time and successive pump and signal pulses superpose in time , thus maximizing the strength of the interaction .",
    "hence the external pump mean field , which is a phase - locked multimode coherent field , can be written as @xmath12@xmath13 is the average laser irradiance ( power per unit area ) , @xmath14 is the normalized ( @xmath15 ) complex spectral component of longitudinal mode labeled by the integer index @xmath16 , and @xmath17 corresponds to the phase - matched mode . as we will be concerned with femtosecond lasers with pulse durations around @xmath18fs , the number of pump modes will be typically on the order of @xmath19 .",
    "two possibilities for pumping can be used : either ( i ) the pump also resonates inside the cavity ( doubly resonant case ) , which requires in addition dispersion compensation at the pump spectral region , or ( ii ) the cavity is transparent for the pump ( singly resonant case ) , a case which is free from the previous restriction and thus more amenable for experimentation , at the expense of a higher threshold , as we will see .",
    "we detail more the latter case in the appendix at the end of this paper .",
    "we will limit here our analysis to non - chirped pumps as chirping requires a more general treatment which will be presented elsewhere .    as the finesse of the cavity",
    "is assumed to be high , the intracavity signal field operator @xmath20 can be written as a superposition of cavity modes . inside the @xmath5 crystal , which extends from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , one can write @xmath23where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath16-th signal mode in the interaction picture , verifying standard boson commutation relations@xmath26 = \\delta _ { m , n } ,   \\label{boson_s}\\]]@xmath27 is the spatial profile of mode @xmath16 , equal to @xmath28 in the case of ring cavities , while for linear cavities it is equal to @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30is the corresponding wavenumber .",
    "finally @xmath31 is the single photon field amplitude , whose value depends on the type of cavity . for a ring cavity",
    "@xmath32where @xmath33 is the transverse area of the signal field , while for a linear cavity @xmath34note that we are writing the field as a superposition of plane waves , but the treatment is approximately valid for gaussian beams provided that the crystal is placed at the beam waist and the rayleigh length is much longer than the crystal length @xmath35 . in this case",
    "@xmath36 with @xmath37 the beam radius .",
    "similarly we have @xmath38 for the pump transverse mode .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 describing the parametric interaction in the nonlinear crystal is given as usual by : @xmath40 ,   \\label{hidef}\\]]where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the nonlinear electric polarization at signal and pump frequencies , and @xmath43 accounts for the effective area of interaction corresponding to the three - mode overlapping integral across the transverse plane and , for gaussian beams , it is given by @xmath44 .",
    "the calculation of the hamiltonian depends on the type of configuration ( singly- or doubly resonant ) . here",
    "we consider the simpler case of a doubly resonant spopo and leave the details of the singly resonant case for the appendix .      in this case",
    "an expression for the intracavity pump field operator @xmath45 analogous to ( [ defes ] ) , now centered around @xmath4 , can be used and the following expression for @xmath39 in the rotating wave approximation is obtained : @xmath46where @xmath47 is the relevant nonlinear susceptibility , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are pump boson operators ( @xmath17 denotes the phase matched mode ) verifying @xmath50 = \\delta _ { m , n}$ ] , and @xmath51 is as @xmath31 with the substitutions @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the phase - mismatching factor of the crystal , @xmath54 , is given by : @xmath55@xmath56 being the phase - mismatch angle : @xmath57    making use of the standard input - output formalism of optical cavities the following set of heisenberg equations for the signal annihilation operators @xmath58 is derived straightforwardly : @xmath59where the cavity damping rate @xmath60 , or cavity linewidth , is equal to @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the transmission factor of the single cavity mirror at which losses are assumed to be concentrated , the coupling constant @xmath63 is given by @xmath64and @xmath65 is a factor depending on the geometry of the cavity that amounts to @xmath66 for the ring cavity and to @xmath67 for the linear cavity .",
    "analogously , the evolution equations for the pump annihilation operators @xmath68 are : @xmath69where @xmath70 is the cavity damping coefficient evaluated at pump frequencies .    to get these simple equations , we have assumed that @xmath71 @xmath72 , and neglected the dispersion of the nonlinear susceptibility , which is a very good approximation as far as the pulses bandwidth is not too large @xcite .",
    "the \" operators correspond to quantum fields entering the cavity through the coupling mirror .",
    "we consider the case where the input signal field is the vacuum , and the input pump field a coherent state .",
    "we have therefore @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and the following correlations @xmath75with the notation @xmath76 , the rest of correlations being null .",
    "the mean input field @xmath77 is related to the @xmath78 and @xmath13 coefficients introduced in by : @xmath79      as detailed in the appendix , in the case where only the signal field is resonating into the cavity the evolution of the signal field annihilation operators is given by an expression identical to ( [ dsdr ] ) , but now the pump annihilation operators are given by @xmath80    we see that these operators contain two contributions .",
    "the first one corresponds to the free - field part that is described by means of two independent boson operators @xmath81 associated to the fields impinging the cavity from both the directions labeled with the superscripts @xmath82 .",
    "we consider the unidirectional pumping case where the input pump field propagating from left to right ( labeled with @xmath83 ) is a coherent state with a mean value of @xmath84 , while the input pump field propagating form right to left ( and labeled with @xmath85 ) is the vacuum @xmath86 .",
    "the mean input field , @xmath87 , is still given by eq .",

    "one can therefore use a linearization procedure for the quantum fluctuations , which amounts to setting @xmath89 in ( [ dsdr ] ) . in the doubly resonant case @xmath90 , as given by ( [ pump ] ) , while in the singly resonant case @xmath91 , as given by ( [ srpump ] ) . in both cases",
    "the final equations for the signal field anihilation operators are identical : @xmath92where @xmath93is a pump amplitude parameter , and @xmath94 is an important scaling parameter for the pump , which can be shown to be the threshold value for the pump in the c.w . regime ( single mode pump configuration ) . in the optimized configuration for the pump focussing ( @xmath95 ) ,",

    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fact that they are close to degeneracy ( see fig . [ caseceigenvalues ] ) is reflected in an almost equal reduction of noise variances below the standard quantum limit . despite the differences reported between the variances evaluated both by means of a perfectly mode matched and a gauss - hermite lo , a still significative degree of squeezing can be detected in realistic situations thus suggesting that the shaping of the lo is not a critical issue for the experimental configuration considered in this section",
    "actually , there is a larger set of supermodes the variances of which are all close to the value of the critical one . in particular , there are about @xmath97 supermodes that have variances comprised in @xmath98 db , between @xmath99 db and @xmath100",
    "furthermore , by considering the number of supermodes that present a noise reduction bigger than @xmath101 db , one discovers that , this time , their number amounts to about @xmath102 .",
    "we have seen that even if the cases a and b do not verify at the same time the condition , the analytical solution obtained in the gaussian approximation works quite well in both cases .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of the fact that this condition gives an approximately good idea of the reliability of gaussian approximation , it is interesting to study the passage from a perfectly gaussian case to a non - gaussian one trough a  gray \" region where the differences between the two cases are not big .",
    "let us consider eq . in the limit of very large @xmath35 . in such case",
    ", since from eq .",
    "@xmath103 , then @xmath104 asymptotically converges to : @xmath105 is constant for values of @xmath35 compatible with a non - gaussian regime . in figure lambda0 l vs l ,",
    "then , we report the values of this product as a function of the crystal thickness . for @xmath106 mm the analytical solution , as expected , is in good agreement with the numerical one , while for greater thicknesses the discrepancy is significative .",
    "also this result is expected , since the analytical solution for the critical eigenvalue has not validity when the condition is violated . on the other side ,",
    "the fact that also the analytical solution reaches asymptotically , for increasing @xmath35 , a plateau suggests a @xmath107-like behavior of @xmath108 .",
    "the existence of such a plateau can be explained from the point of view of the evolution of the pump and signal pulses in the time domain . as discussed in the previous section , when the condition is violated , the walk - off between pump and signal is bigger than the pump temporal width . as a consequence ,",
    "the exchange of energy between the two fields is disadvantaged till a point where the threshold can not change anymore even increasing the crystal length . since , from eqs . and ,",
    "@xmath109 , for large values of @xmath35 , then , also the product @xmath110 reach a constant value , thus explaining the plateau in fig .",

    "[ lambda0 l vs l ] .",
    "as already discussed in case c , in non - gaussian configurations the pump bandwidth is larger than the phase - matching one , thus not all the pump modes are phase matched and not all of them contribute to the final value of the threshold . therefore the number of pump modes actually involved is smaller than the nominal value @xmath111 that should , then , be corrected .    from a quantum point of view",
    ", we have detailed in the previous sections the noise properties of the supermodes connected to the first four highest @xmath112 ( see tables [ vars09a ] , [ vars09b ] and [ vars09c ] ) and we calculated the number of supermodes showing a squeezing better than @xmath101 db for getting a qualitative indication about the  multimodicity \" of the system prepared in a specific experimental configuration .",
    "these results can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ vkmin_vs_l ] where the noise variances of the supermodes that satisfy this criterium have been traced for the three cases previously discussed .",
    "the curve in the middle corresponds to case a ( @xmath113 mm ) , a gaussian configuration . as the thickness of the crystal",
    "is increased to @xmath114 mm ( case b ) the condition is violated but the gaussian approximation is still good .",
    "this means that , even if the value of @xmath115 is decreasing ( because we are reducing the number of pump modes that are phase - matched ) the spectrum is still a geometric progression but with a smaller , in absolute value , common ratio ( see @xmath116 in eq . ) thus causing an overall decrease of the spectrum with respect to the case a. the consequence is a reduction of the number of supermodes with a squeezing greater than @xmath101 db as it results from the upper curve in fig .",
    "[ vkmin_vs_l ] ( red circles ) . finally ,",
    "when the crystal length is further increased to @xmath117 mm ( case c ) , we pass to a completely non - gaussian configuration where the decrease of the critical eigenvalue @xmath115 ( from @xmath118 for @xmath113 mm to @xmath119 for @xmath117 mm ) causes a significative deformation of the spectrum and a non null set of eigenvalues flatten around @xmath108 . in this case , since the degree of squeezing for each supermode depends on the ratio @xmath120 ( see eq . ) , the amount of squeezing is globally increased as the lower curve ( green diamonds ) in fig . [ vkmin_vs_l ] shows .",
    "these results not only confirm that a spopo is a highly multi - mode device but also show another important quality : the malleability for controlling its  multimodicity \" .",
    "we have seen , in fact , that one can just increase the thickness of the nonlinear crystal in order to improve the number of supermodes that play an important role from a quantum point of view .    in this paper",
    "we have presented a study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath2 in function of the crystal length @xmath121 . however , since both the pump pulse width and the crystal length are present in eq . ,",
    "notice that effects similar to those discussed in this section can be observed by playing with @xmath122 and keeping constant @xmath35 .",
    "in fact the passage from a gaussian to a non - gaussian configuration takes place when the pump bandwidth @xmath123 becomes smaller than the phase - matching one @xmath124 and , clearly , this can be obtained keeping fixed the latter and increasing @xmath122 ( see fig .",
    "[ legenda ] ) .",
    "eventually one could even fix @xmath35 and @xmath125 and play with the group velocity mismatch by choosing different types of nonlinearities , but , experimentally , this could result in a stiffer malleability of the device .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that both the dynamical and quantum noise properties of the spopo depend on the spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath126 of the linear coupling matrix @xmath2 .",
    "we have studied in detail this spectrum in various experimentally feasible configurations , using either an analytical approach in some simple limit cases , or a numerical approach in the general case .",
    "it turns out that among the roughly 100,000 eigenvalues , 99,900 or so are zero , and about a hundred are significantly different from zero and contribute to the quantum dynamics of the system .",
    "spopos are therefore devices which produce simultaneously many highly squeezed vacuum modes .",
    "this property can be used to improve the performances of metrological methods using frequency combs , for example to perform ultra - accurate time transfer between remote clocks beyond the shot noise limit @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well known that if one mixes by one way or another different squeezed modes , one gets strongly entangled states @xcite .",
    "this is also the case here : we will show in a forthcoming publication that spopos are indeed likely to generate various pairs of strongly entangled supermodes , as well as multipartite entangled states .",
    "more generally , this paper is an example of the fact that , by using appropriately chosen pump spectra and phase matching curves , one can reach various eigenvalue spectra , and therefore tailor at will the quantum properties of the light generated by the optical system , which can be useful for example to generate interesting states for multidimensional quantum information processing .",
    "we detail in this appendix the derivation of the heisenberg equations in the case of a singly resonant degenerate type i spopo , i.e. when the signal field resonates inside the cavity , but not the pump field .",
    "we consider here the case of the linear fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the treatment of this case is more complex than the doubly resonant case usually considered in theoretical approaches as the pump field can not be quantized inside the cavity .",
    "the signal field inside the nonlinear crystal , which extends from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , is written as @xmath127where @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "on the contrary , the pump field is not affected by the cavity and hence it is given by a continuum of modes .",
    "we shall use the common approach of quantizing the pump field in a line of length @xmath130 with periodic boundary conditions and , in the end of the calculations , we will make @xmath131 .",

    "<S> quantum models for synchronously pumped type i optical parametric oscillators ( spopo ) are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the dynamics of spopos , which typically involves millions of coupled signal longitudinal modes , is significantly simplified when one considers the  supermodes \" , which are independent linear superpositions of all the signal modes diagonalizing the parametric interaction . in terms of these supermodes </S>",
    "<S> the spopo dynamics becomes that of about a hundred of independent , single mode degenerate opos , each of them being a squeezer . </S>",
    "<S> one derives a general expression for the squeezing spectrum measured in a balanced homodyne detection experiment , valid for any temporal shape of the local oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> realistic cases are then studied using both analytical and numerical methods : the oscillation threshold is derived , and the spectral and temporal shapes of the squeezed supermodes are characterized . </S>"
