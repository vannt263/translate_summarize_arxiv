    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) is one of the major research areas in cosmology today @xcite .",
    "it started around @xmath1 , and by redshift of @xmath2 most of the hydrogen atoms in the intergalactic medium were ionized by the uv photons emitted by stars and quasars @xcite .",
    "hydrogen reionization was closely followed by first helium reionization during which helium atoms lost their outer electron , while second helium reionization occurred around @xmath3 .",
    "the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is a nuisance for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) cosmology as cmb photons scatter off the ionized gas .",
    "the precision with which the total optical depth to reionization , @xmath0 , can be measured from the cmb data is very poor , e.g. , the 68% confidence level in @xmath0 corresponds to a relative error of @xmath4 @xcite . because so little is known about the eor at present , the large uncertainty in @xmath0 propagates to other cosmological parameters extracted from the cmb data .",
    "luckily , alternative probes of reionization , such as the 21-cm line of hydrogen , will in the future provide independent constraints on @xmath0 and help to remove the related uncertainty @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cmb scattering , the ionized plasma leaves other fingerprints on observed radiation .",
    "any radio waves will follow the dispersion relation @xmath5 as they propagate through cold unmagnetized plasma with electron density @xmath6 , where @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the frequency of the wave and @xmath9 its wavenumber , @xmath10 is the speed of light , and @xmath11 s@xmath12 is the plasma frequency . as a result ,",
    "the group velocity of any radio wave packet is modified in a frequency - dependent way as the signal travels through the ionized plasma .",
    "in such a medium , a transient at frequency @xmath8 is delayed by @xmath13 seconds , where @xmath8 is in ghz and the dispersion measure , dm , is defined as the integrated electron density along the line of sight in units of pc @xmath14 . for extragalactic sources ,",
    "the dm includes the contributions from the interstellar medium of the milky way , the host galaxy of the source , and the igm . for sources at high redshifts ( @xmath15 )",
    ", the ionized igm should be the dominant source of dispersion ( dm @xmath16 pc @xmath14 ) without substantial contamination from the milky way , the local universe and the host galaxy ( dm @xmath17 pc @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus , measuring the dispersion of high - redshift sources offers a unique way to probe the ionized igm and constrain the cosmic reionization history .",
    "in particular , the dispersion of radio emission by high redshift gamma ray bursts ( grb ) was discussed as a probe of the igm by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the recently discovered fast radio burst ( frb ) frb150418 , associated with a galaxy at @xmath18 , provided a direct measurement of the cosmic baryon density of the igm of @xmath19 through its dm measurement @xcite .",
    "although both the dispersion measure and @xmath0 probe the same column density of the free electrons , the connection between these two quantities has not been made in the literature .",
    "assuming that radio transients exist at high enough redshifts , we discuss their cosmological implications in section [ sec : tdm ] focusing on the relation between @xmath0 and dm and showing that an ensemble of high - redshift radio transients would probe @xmath0 to sub - percent accuracy . in section [ sec : ska ] we discuss perspectives for such measurement .",
    "assuming that radio transients , such as the population of frbs , exist at high enough redshifts , we show that the square kilometer array ( ska ) will have sufficient sensitivity to probe these sources out to @xmath20 and fully constrain the history of reionization through their dm .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] . throughout this work we use cosmological parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 from @xcite .",
    "we start by exploring the connection between the dispersion measure in the signal of a cosmological transient at a redshift @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the contribution of the igm at redshifts out to @xmath27 to the total optical depth of the cmb , @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 is the thompson cross - section , @xmath32 is the differential of the proper distance and @xmath33^{1/2}$ ] is the hubble parameter .",

    "is the redshift - dependent hydrogen ionization fraction , @xmath40 is the fraction of singly ionized helium and @xmath41 is the fraction of fully ionized helium .    in the left panel of figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "we show examples of @xmath42 for three different models of the reionization history each shown for two values of @xmath0 = 0.057 and 0.078 , both within @xmath43 confidence level of the recent planck satellite measurement @xmath44 @xcite . assuming that hydrogen and first helium reionization occur simultaneously due to their similar ionization potentials ( i.e. , @xmath45 )",
    ", we adopt the following models ( i ) an instantaneous reionization where the hydrogen ionization fraction jumps from 0 to 1 at @xmath46 ( 10.7 ) for @xmath0 = 0.057 ( 0.078 ) , ( ii ) a reionization history parameterized by the conventional form @xmath47 \\label{eq : xhii}\\ ] ] for the same values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and ( iii ) a realistic reionization history which for @xmath0 = 0.078 assumes that star formation occurs in halos with mass larger than the atomic cooling threshold , m@xmath50^{-3/2}$ ] m@xmath51 , and accounts for the effect of the photoheating feedback on star formation @xcite , while in the case of @xmath0 = 0.057 only very massive halos contributed to reionization , m@xmath52^{-3/2}$ ] m@xmath51 . finally , we assume a simple model for second helium reionization with @xmath53 fraction being of the same form as in eq .",

    "figure [ fig:1 ] also shows the integrated optical depth out to redshift @xmath27 ( middle panel ) and the dm of a source at redshift @xmath27 ( right panel ) for the three reionization histories and the two values of @xmath0 .",
    "both dm and @xmath26 saturate at high redshifts before the beginning of reionization when the free electron fraction drops to zero .",
    "depending on the normalization , the value to which @xmath34 saturates is either @xmath56 or @xmath57 , while the upper limit on the dm is slightly different for each reionization history . for the high optical depth",
    "the dm takes the values of 7225 pc @xmath14 in the case of instanteneous eor , 7213 pc @xmath14 for the @xmath58 model and 7101 pc @xmath14 for the more realistic scenario ; while for the low optical depth the values are 6215 , 6190 and 6137 pc @xmath14 respectively .",
    "although the dependence of the dispersion measure of high - redshift transients on the reionization history has been explored in literature @xcite , the connection between the intergalactic dm and @xmath34 has not been made .",
    "given a series of the dm measurements out to redshift @xmath27 for an extragalactic transient population , @xmath34 can be computed precisely . using integration by parts",
    "we can analytically derive the relation between @xmath34 and dm@xmath59 @xmath60\\times \\sigma_t .",

    "probing the evolution of the dm with redshifts gives a measure of @xmath34 and integrating over the whole range of the dm up to its maximal value should allow one to derive @xmath0 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath61 curve has a weak dependence on the reionization history .",
    "for the same @xmath58 model of eor , changing the duration of reionization from @xmath62 to @xmath63 decreases the value of the dm by @xmath64 which is of order the contribution from the interstellar medium inside the milky way to the total dm and is small compared to the extragalactic contribution for cosmological transients .     as a function of the dm in a fully ionized igm . for a transient at redshift",

    "there is no doubt that probing the reionization history with highly dispersed transients is very challenging , requiring : ( i ) bright radio transients at high enough redshifts , and ( ii ) sensitive enough telescope which is designed to probe the corresponding time delays .",
    "here we consider a possibility that recently discovered frbs could play the role of cosmological beacons and regard the future ska as a tool to probe them .",
    "frbs are short ( @xmath71 millisecond ) , bright ( @xmath71 jy ) pulses at radio frequencies ( @xmath71 1 ghz ) observed over the entire sky @xcite .",
    "out of 17 known frbs @xcite 15 bursts , including the first frb discovered in 2007 @xcite , were found in the data collected by parkes radio telescope in the radio band with central frequency of @xmath72 mhz and bandwidth of 288 mhz @xcite , one frb was detected in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey at @xmath73 mhz frequencies @xcite and one frb was found in the green bank telescope ( gbt ) data within the 700 - 900 mhz frequency range @xcite .",
    "these bursts are very bright pulses with the peak detected flux , @xmath74 , being in the 0.3 - 1.3 jy range for all the bursts except for the original `` lorimer '' burst which had @xmath75 jy @xcite . except for",
    "recently discovered frb150418 which was followed by a @xmath716 day radio afterglow , the radio bursts observed so far are not known to be accompanied by emission in other wavelength regimes , such as x - rays or gamma - rays , making their identification more difficult .",
    "the short duration of frbs allows one to probe the delay time at each frequency . as for pulsars , the observed delay scales as @xmath76 @xcite , which can be explained by dispersion in a cold plasma",
    "however , the typical dm for frbs , @xmath77 pc @xmath14 , is much larger than what is usually measured for the galactic transients , @xmath78 pc @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , an extragalactic explanation for the observed frbs , which was recently supported by the host galaxy identification for frb150418 @xcite , is usually invoked @xcite with the observed dm of frbs corresponding to their redshifts in the range @xmath79",
    ". however , there might be several distinct populations of sources contributing to the discovered frbs , and there are theoretical models where the observed high dm of frbs is be produced locally @xcite .    in the following",
    "we consider a population of frbs similar to the detected ones but located at much higher redshifts during the eor and consider prospects for their detection . using the existing data we first estimate the redshift of each known frb , @xmath80 , relying on the observed dispersion measure @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the dm contributions from both the milky way and the host frb galaxy are considered to be foregrounds , which we remove to isolate the cosmological signal .",
    "we estimate the extragalactic contribution as dm@xmath81 = dm@xmath82- dm@xmath83 , ignoring the host contribution which scales as @xmath84 for cosmological frbs .",
    "the milky way contribution based on the ne2001 galactic electron density model @xcite is given by @xcite for each frb location .",
    "next , we estimate the intrinsic luminosity of the bursts at their rest - frame central frequencies @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mean observed frequency , @xmath88 is the luminosity distance , assuming the source emission is isotropic .",
    "we also assume a flat spectral energy distribution since there is no spectral information available for most of the detected frbs with the exception of the burst detected in the arecibo survey @xcite and the recently detected frb150418 .",
    "finally , we choose four representative frbs out of the observed ones selecting an frb with the maximal ( excluding the `` lorimer '' burst ) , median and minimal intrinsic luminosity densities and also considering the the `` lorimer '' burst .",
    "the details ( @xmath89 ) of these bursts are summarized in table 1 .",

    "for each burst we reverse the eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) and find the peak flux of each frb varying its redshift @xmath65 , or , equivalently , its observed frequency @xmath95 .",
    "the expected scaling of the signal with @xmath95 is shown on the left panel of figure [ fig : sn ] for each type of the frbs together with the expected @xmath96 sensitivity of ska at each frequency shown for phase 1 and 2 of the ska - mid in band 1 ( @xmath97 ghz ) and band 2 ( @xmath98 ghz ) and of ska - low ( @xmath99 mhz ) .",
    "for both ska - mid , which is an array of dish antennas , and ska - low , an array of low - frequency dipole antennas , the sensitivity is estimated as follows @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the integration time , @xmath102 is the bandwidth and factor 2 of accounts for 2 polarization channels .",
    "sefd @xmath103 measured in jy , is the system equivalent flux density which depends on the effective area , @xmath104 , and the system temperature , @xmath105 , which for phase 1 of the ska can be found in the ska online documentation for the entire ska - low array and for a single dish of ska - mid . to estimate the sensitivity of phase 1 of",
    "ska - mid we assume that the effective area of the array is 133 times the area of a single dish . based on the ska online documentation",
    "we assume that phase 2 of ska - mid will be 10 times better than phase 1 in terms of sefd , and ska - low will be 4 times better . on the right panel of figure [ fig : sn ]",
    "we show the signal to noise of each frb as a function of redshift with horizontal lines marking the @xmath96 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 detection thresholds .",
    "according to our estimates and in agreement with previous studies @xcite , ska - mid will be a very powerful observatory for detecting all the frbs except for the weakest ones , to which band-2 of ska - mid should still be sensitive enough .",
    "on the other hand , phase 1 of ska - low is expected to be sensitive only to the strongest frbs of the lorimer type , while phase 2 can also be sensitive to the entire brightest half of the frb population .",
    "increasing integration time can be beneficial in this case since the bursts are stretched in time by the factor of @xmath108 and the delay time grows for higher redshift sources observed at low frequencies . with different integration times for ska - mid ( @xmath109 ms ) and ska - low ( @xmath110 ms ) , which explains the jump in signal to noise ,",
    "all frbs brighter or identical to the median are detectable with high signal to noise , s / n@xmath111 , out to @xmath112 and out to @xmath20 with high signal to noise s / n@xmath113 even with ska phase 1 ; while weaker frbs will be detectable with phase 2 out @xmath114 with s / n@xmath113 .    with current constraints of the reionization history , frbs at redshift @xmath115",
    "are expected have a very large dm of several thousands ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) . to allow for detection of",
    "so high dm with a telescope , one simply needs to assume that the maximal dispersion smearing within a frequency channel , @xmath116 seconds , is bigger than the sampling time , @xmath117 . here",
    "@xmath118 is the frequency channel width in ghz , and @xmath119 is the minimum ( lowest ) frequency in the observation band .",
    "thus , the maximal dm that can be probed by a telescope is @xmath120 this argument should equally apply for both dishes ( such as ska - mid ) and a low - frequency array ( such as ska - low ) .",
    "most of the known frb were detected with cutoff implied on the dm at dm@xmath121 2000 pc @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , higher dms are being accessed with ongoing surveys .",
    "for example , @xcite searched dm trials up to 3000 pc @xmath14 ; while a recently developed pipeline allows the data searched over the dm from 0 to 5000 pc @xmath14 and over widths from 0.128 to 262 ms @xcite .",
    "however , no frbs with the dm above 1700 pc @xmath14 were detected so far .",
    "future instruments , such as the ska , will allow one to explore higher values of the dm .",
    "in particular , with the phase 1 of the ska the search out to dispersion measures of 3000 pc @xmath14 is proposed allowing to probe frbs out to @xmath3 , while with ska phase-2 it should be possible to search out to dispersion measures of 10,000 pc @xmath14 and beyond @xcite probing the frb population during the eor .    in the above discussion we assumed that there is no significant scattering in the intergalactic medium . with scattering",
    ", the observed flux is expected to decrease @xcite . however , for all the observed frbs the scattering by the igm was estimated to be small @xcite . taking this into account together with the fact that the peak flux could have been missed by observation , the signal which we quoted above ( and , thus , the signal - to - noise values ) should be regarded as lower limits only .",
    "in this letter we explored the connection between the dm of high - redshift radio transients and the total cmb optical depth @xmath0 by deriving an analytic @xmath26-dm relation , which can be used to constrain @xmath0 provided radio transients exist during reionization . assuming sources , such as frbs , exist at high redshifts",
    ", we have shown that phase 1 of the ska or a similar radio telescope should be able to probe the brightest half of the population out to high redshifts , @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", it should be possible to test the full reionization history with phase 1 of the ska through dm of these sources . according to the latest estimates , frbs are frequent events , with @xmath122 of them occurring every day @xcite , and at least one of them",
    "was confirmed to be extragalactic @xcite .",
    "therefore , there are good chances for detection of more frbs at cosmological distances with future telescopes , such as the ska , especially when exploring new region of the parameter space , such as higher dispersion measures and lower frequencies . moreover , depending on the luminosity function of the population , high redshift sources could be gravitationally lensed by the foreground large scale structure , and , thus , more easily observed @xcite .",
