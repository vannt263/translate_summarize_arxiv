    "study of heavy quarks will be an important research area in experiments at the lhc .",
    "investigation of heavy quarks is interesting on its own ( cp - violation , properties of @xmath1-hadrons , constrains on hadronization models , heavy flavour pdfs , etc . ) and as a background to other processes ( higgs , top quark , beyond sm particle production ) .",
    "one of the first problems in the research will be measurement of the total cross section @xmath2 . due to the huge cross section",
    ", large statistics will be available at once after the collider launch . so the measurements will help to check and understand the lhc detectors .",
    "heavy quarks introduce additional complications in calculations due to non - zero masses , which play the role of supplementary energy scales .",
    "the 15 year story of the @xmath0-quark production cross section calculations and measurements at the tevatron shows a remarkable example of the troubles ( see details in a nice review  @xcite ) .",
    "all approaches to the calculations can be divided into two classes : the first class consists of cross section calculators , producing total cross sections ( sometimes within cuts applied ) and kinematic distributions : nlo , acot , bsmn , fonll , gm - vfns ( see  @xcite and refs . within ) .",
    "these methods are able to take into account radiative corrections and/or resummation effects ( e.g. large logarithms of @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) .",
    "the state of the art amongst the approaches in the @xmath5 calculations is fonll  @xcite .",
    "the method is based on matching of the nlo calculations and resummation of @xmath6 . due to the high @xmath7 region available at the tevatron",
    ", we have 2 different energy scales , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , in the process",
    "so large logarithms @xmath6 appear in all orders of the qcd expansion of @xmath10 .",
    "fonll resums the terms in the nll approximation and uses the following prescription : @xmath11 in order to exclude double counting a massless approximation to nlo should be subtracted from the resummation contribution .",
    "the weight function g(@xmath12 ) ensures a proper application region for the resummation ( here , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the resummation term has the structure : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are factorization scales .",
    "the functions here are convoluted with respect to momentum fractions .",
    "@xmath17 is an nlo expression with no large logarithms thanks to the choice @xmath18 ( it is calculated in pqcd ) .",
    "the function @xmath19 describes the resummed final - state collinear logarithms . due to the large @xmath20 ,",
    "initial expressions for @xmath21 can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the method produces total cross sections and distributions .",
    "it has been realized for heavy quark hadroproduction  @xcite and photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the second class of codes is monte - carlo generators , which can produce monte - carlo events .",
    "the state - of - the - art player for the task considered is mc@nlo  @xcite .",
    "it uses an exact nlo calculator to generate events at nlo and a special procedure to match the events with further parton showers .",
    "so the program can give fully exclusive events at nlo with showering , hadronization and decay effects .",
    "the herwig showering and hadronization model is applied .",
    "the big advantage of the code is fast event generation ( @xmath2210 times faster a lo codes ) .",
    "the program gives reliable predictions in the whole @xmath7 region due to the large qcd scales used , @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , variation of the scales allows one to estimate nnlo uncertainties .",
    "absence of massive @xmath0-quarks in the initial state simplifies the use of pdfs .",
    "[ fg : mcatnlo - pt ] shows the impact of the showering effects on the @xmath7 distribution .",
    "comparison ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : mcatnlo - fonll ] ) shows very good agreement between the fonll and mc@nlo approaches .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 4.4 cm    = 7.5 cm = 4.4 cm    theorists and monte - carlo code authors have 2 - 3 years until real data at the lhc .",
    "so , a couple of problems could be solved . _",
    "1 ) _ nnlo calculations for @xmath2 .",
    "qcd nlo results have a big scale dependence : variation @xmath24 gives @xmath2 = 276  645 @xmath18b with a central value of 496 @xmath18b . due to recent progress in qcd nnlo calculations",
    "this task can be posed and attempted . _ 2 ) _ matching nlo with resummation contributions in events : tevatron experience shows the importance of large logarithms in the high @xmath7 region . since experimentalists require events , the task also has a high priority .",
    "there was a problem with interpretation of the @xmath1-hadron production cross section in run i. the first value of the data / theory ratio was @xmath25  @xcite , subsequent progress gave a new value @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "fonll , new pdfs with a higher value of @xmath27 , and new @xmath28 were taken into account .",
    "run ii brought new experimental improvements : better secondary vertex reconstruction , more efficient @xmath1-hadron i d , much more statistics available , @xmath7 spectra down to 0 gev .",

    "the study of inclusive @xmath0-jets in the high @xmath7 region does nt have this drawback , but statistical errors in the measurements are much higher .",
    "the heavy quark production cross section is huge at the lhc , @xmath41 @xmath38 .",
    "so problems of triggering will be very important in all experiments .",
    "the most appropriate triggers in the @xmath1-hadron analyses are based on muons ( di - muon , single - muon ) .",
    "first measurements at the lhc will be inclusive ones ( at first , measurements of the total cross sections ) .",

    "both detectors have precise tracking and vertex detectors , which are important in b - physics ( more details about cms / atlas may be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "due to strict conditions of triggering ( atlas and cms triggers should reduce the total rate , 40 mhz , to 200 hz(atlas)/150 hz(cms ) ) , there will be a competition on bandwidth and hlt resources for b - objects . the main triggers which will be used in the total cross section measurements are di - muon and single - muon ones : atlas di - muon @xmath33 3 - 4 gev in @xmath42 2.7 ( 60% efficiency , 10hz rate for @xmath43 after hlt ) ; cms di - muon @xmath33 3 gev in @xmath42 2.4 ; atlas 1-muon @xmath33 8 gev in @xmath42 2.7 ( this can help to reconstruct exclusive @xmath1-hadronic decays , but will only be applied in regimes with l @xmath44 @xmath45s@xmath29 ) ; cms 1-muon @xmath33 14 gev in @xmath42 2.1 .",
