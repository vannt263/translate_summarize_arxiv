    "calculating qcd amplitudes by means of feynman diagrams can be an extremely challenging task .",
    "the gauge - dependence of vertices and unphysical degrees of freedom often makes intermediate steps immensely complicated .",
    "however , in 1998 chalmers and siegel showed that the complexity of feynman diagram calculations in yang - mills theory could be greatly reduced if a so - called space - cone gauge was used @xcite ( see also @xcite for similar simplifications in other theories ) .",
    "by now several alternative approaches are also available , such as the britto - cachazo - feng - witten ( bcfw ) recursion relation @xcite . at tree - level the above mentioned space - cone construction is closely related to these relations @xcite .",
    "the main goal with this short paper is to write down all feynman rules for qcd when working in the space - cone gauge . to our knowledge",
    "not all of these have been explicitly presented in the literature , and it is therefore our hope that this paper will allow for easy and straightforward application whenever such rules are needed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows ; in section [ sec : yml ] we review the yang - mills lagrangian in space - cone gauge and the elimination of unphysical degrees of freedom . section [ sec : spf ] introduces some notation and the spinor helicity formalism . in section [ sec : ymf ] we give the feynman rules following from section [ sec : yml ] . in section",
    "[ sec : bcfw ] we make some comments on the connection between bcfw relations and the space - cone gauge . in section [ sec : af ] we add quarks to the lagrangian and show that effective four - point vertices involving quark - antiquark pairs will appear . in section [ sec : qf ]",
    "we give the feynman rules for quarks and finally in section [ sec : con ] we have our conclusions .",
    "we start from the standard lagrangian of yang - mills theory @xmath0 = -\\frac{1}{4}f^a_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu\\ , a } ,    \\label{ym_lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 = if_{abc}t^c , & \\nonumber \\\\    & \\mathrm{tr}[t^at^b ] = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{ab},&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath2 the contraction gives @xmath3 here @xmath4 is just the usual vector field with inner product given by @xmath5 we now introduce the lightcone components @xmath6 and in terms of these the inner product is @xmath7 our first goal is to express eq .   in terms of the lightcone components",
    ", however , we use the gauge freedom to set @xmath8 , and hence discard all terms containing an @xmath9 . note that in many of the intermediate calculations we have used the fact that a term symmetric in two color indices will vanish when contracted with the anti - symmetric colorfactor .    written in terms of the lightcone components the quadratic part of eq .",

    "doing a bit of rewriting , we obtain @xmath18 this is the pure yang - mills lagrangian written in terms of two scalar fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 , consistent with massless vector fields only having two physical degrees of freedom .",
    "we choose to use the pauli matrices with the following normalization @xmath21 such that a contraction between these and a four - vector is @xmath22 and @xmath23 note that @xmath24 , so if @xmath25 this matrix only has one non - vanishing eigenvalue and can be decomposed into a bispinor product @xmath26 we will from now on use the following braket notation @xmath27 notice that our convention differs from @xcite .      as always when one wants to do amplitude calculations by feynman rules there are some lorentz frames in which the calculations are easier to perform . to set up this we introduce two ( for now ) arbitrary massless _ reference _ momenta , one denoted with a @xmath28 and",
    "one denoted with @xmath29 .",
    "we then choose to work in the lorentz frame where our two reference momenta have the following simple expressions @xmath30 that is the frame where they both move along the @xmath31 axis , but in opposite direction .",
    "note that @xmath32 , and that we have called the spinor of the @xmath28 momentum for @xmath33 and vice versa .",
    "our choice of labelling will soon become apparent . since any four - vector , contracted with the pauli matrices , is written in the form of eq .",
    ", using the following normalized matrices as basis @xmath34 four - vectors take the form @xmath35 where the coefficients are just the lightcone components . since @xmath36",
    "the lightcone components are @xmath37    we also choose to use our reference momenta in the expression for the polarization vectors @xmath38 @xmath39 that is , we have used our reference momenta to fix the gauge - freedom one has in polarization vectors .    from eq .",
    "it is evident that we are only concerned with the @xmath40 components , and from eq .",
    "we see that @xmath41 hence , with this setup we have that only the positive helicity gluons have the @xmath42 lightcone component and only the negative helicity gluons the @xmath43 component . for this reason",
    "the @xmath44 labels in eq .",
    "is now actually denoting the helicity and not just the specific lightcone component .",
    "in this section we present the color - ordered feynman rules one obtains from eq .  , that is the rules one could use in calculating , for instance , the partial tree amplitudes @xmath45 in @xmath46 a_n(1,2,\\ldots , n)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all non - cyclic permutations of external legs .",
    "before we do so , remember that in the last section our massless reference momenta was just arbitrarily chosen , however , if we make the choice that @xmath47 is one of the _ external _ momenta of a @xmath42 helicity gluon and @xmath48 one of the _ external _ momenta of a @xmath43 helicity gluon , the rules and explicit calculations simplify greatly .",
    "the external _ non_-reference legs will just contribute with the plus or minus lightcone component of the polarization vector , depending on the helicity ( note that we _ always _ take external momenta to be outgoing ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath49 or @xmath50 however , for the reference legs the @xmath51 vanish because of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the numerator .",
    "these factors can only be countered in the three - point vertex and only if they sit on the @xmath54 term , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath55 the product of these two contributions is @xmath56 , and since every diagram will always contain this product ( assuming one takes both reference momenta to correspond to external legs ) , we just write the external lines for reference legs as @xmath57    the term representing the propagator is the usual boson propagator ( notice that we for simplicity discard all factors of @xmath58 in the following rules ) @xmath59    the three - point vertex splits into the case where one of the lines is a reference leg and the case in which non of the lines are . with a reference leg",
    "present we have used up the @xmath54 term for a cancellation like in eq .   and are only left with the contribution from the opposite helicity leg , through @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. _ + @xmath61 or + @xmath62 +   + where the minus sign in the second diagram comes from the antisymmetry of the colorfactor @xmath63 .",
    "there can only be _",
    "one _ reference leg on a three - point vertex since there is only one term in these that can counter the vanishing of that leg .    in the second case of no reference leg ,",
    "the three - point vertex is + @xmath64 +   + again the minus sign is a consequence of the anti - symmetric colorfactor .",
    "we can never have a reference leg on a four - point vertex since these do not contribute with a similar `` @xmath65 '' counter - term . however , there are still two different kinds of four - point vertices because of the two possible helicity configurations @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( cyclically speaking ) .",
    "the first case is + @xmath68 +   + and the second case +   + @xmath69 + these rules reduce the number of diagrams contributing to a specific color - ordered amplitude significantly .",
    "however , the reduction relies heavily on the choice of having external momenta as reference momenta such that diagrams with both reference legs on the same three - point vertex and diagrams with a reference leg on a four - point vertex all vanish .",
    "the rules are of course perfectly allowed without this choice , but then no such constraints exist and the simplified diagrams , and should be discarded .    before turning to the inclusion of quarks let us make some comments on the connection between working in space - cone gauge and the bcfw recursion relation .",
    "one of the interesting features of the space - cone gauge is , that a diagrammatic proof of the bcfw recursion relation can be obtained from the above feynman rules .",
    "the main observation is that no vertex depends on @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , a shift in the @xmath71 direction of a reference leg leaves no imprint on the vertices , but only on internal propagators . using a propagator relation between shifted and unshifted propagators , it is possible to relate amplitudes calculated in space - cone gauge to the bcfw result . for the four- and five - point case this calculation was done in @xcite where the reader may also find details regarding the propagator identity .",
    "however , these two examples are in a way special , since no four - point vertex enters the calculations .",
    "the first case where the four - point vertex is manifest for all choices of reference momenta is the @xmath72 six - point amplitude . in a very condensed notation",
    "it is given by @xmath73 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the positive and negative reference gluons respectively .",
    "when we use the propagator identity introduced by vaman and yao , we obtain a factorization which has the structure of a three - point amplitude times a five - point amplitude . here",
    "the four - point vertex enters explicitly in the five - point amplitude , which seems to be in conflict with @xcite , where it was shown explicitly that the five - point amplitude is independent of the four - point vertex .",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 to explain this , we notice , that the result in @xcite exploits the fact that in the space - cone gauge , the number of diagrams and the types of vertices that enters a specific calculation , is highly dependent on the chosen reference lines . when two of the external gluons are chosen as references , the four - point vertex in the five - point amplitude is absent",
    ". however , if we only choose one of the external momenta as reference , the four - point vertex will still be present in the calculation .",
    "the structure of the five - point amplitude , with only one external gluon chosen as reference line , is shown below .",
    "@xmath76 comparing this with and we notice , that the diagrams with four - point vertices exactly matches those of .",
    "the diagrams with only three - point vertices can just as easily be found when using the propagator identity in the rest of the diagrams .",
    "we therefore conclude that the amplitudes combine in exactly the right way as to reproduce the bcfw result , and that we should expect the procedure to generalize to any number of external legs .",
    "lastly , we would like to make a comment regarding the propagator identity that is needed in order to conclude the bcfw recursion relation in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the identity is equivalent to @xmath77 over a contour enclosing all poles . in the original proof of the bcfw recursion relation @xcite , two main properties of tree - level amplitudes was needed .",
    "first that the poles of the shifted amplitude @xmath78 all come from propagators going on - shell .",
    "second , that @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "these statements are proved in @xcite , but the arguments become almost trivial when put into the light of the space - cone formalism .",
    "the first statement is immediately clear since the shifts can be chosen such that the vertices of the amplitude are unaffected .",
    "hence , only internal propagators change .",
    "then the second statement follows from since the integrand obviously converges fast enough to zero .",
    "we will now add quarks to our lagrangian .",
    "this amounts to adding @xmath81 to eq .  ,",
    "where @xmath82 is just the lagrangian for the free dirac field , and the interaction can be written out in terms of the lightcone components as @xmath83\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we have also written the @xmath84-matrices in the lightcone notation now , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath85 , _ etc . _ the expression for @xmath16 , following from eq .",

    "the external states for quarks are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are positive- and negativ - energy solutions , respectively , of the dirac equation , with @xmath93 labelling spin up or down .",
    "the propagator is just the usual dirac propagator @xmath94    from eq .",
    "we can read off the color - ordered feynman rules involving vertices with quarks .",
