    "dark matter has a long history@xcite . however , we can reduce the discussion to the main attributes a theory must satisfy in order to explain astrophysical data .",
    "we maintain that the equation of state for whatever particle or particles that makes up dark matter is the key concept .",
    "the first criteria is that dark matter must be able to support itself from gravitational collapse .",
    "the second criteria is that a dark matter object must be big enough to encompass a whole cluster of ordinary galaxies .",
    "these two criteria severely limit what particles dark matter could be made up of . if the dark matter particle is a boson , it must support itself through thermal pressure such as the ideal equation of state .",
    "if this were not so , it would condense into the lowest ground state and become a black hole .",
    "the characteristic scale of objects supporting themselves from thermal pressure are stars , but they also need an intrinsic energy source",
    ". no star can survive its own gravitational pull using thermal pressure alone unless it has intrinsic internal energy generation .",
    "it would seem then that bosons as dark matter have significant fundamental physics issues .",
    "the remaining dark matter particles will be fermions .",
    "now , there are two ways such a dark matter object can preserve itself from its own gravity field : the first method is the same as a boson ( the thermal equation of state ) , and the second method is from degeneracy pressure .",
    "the first mechanism suffers from the same problem as the last discussion because using thermal pressure for stability against gravitational collapse does not depend on the spin of the particle .",
    "the second method of degeneracy pressure , occurring in neutron stars ( nucleons ) and white dwarfs ( electrons ) is critically dependent on the mass of the fermion .",
    "degenerate objects made up of fermions become increasingly smaller as the mass of the fermion increases .",
    "thus , in order to have a dark matter object large enough to embed an ordinary cluster of galaxies within it , the fermion particle mass has to be much smaller than the mass of the electron .",
    "the third issue here is data integrity : when reducing raw data to processed data , assumptions nearly always have to be made , such as hydrostatic equilibrium for x - ray cluster gas , or neutrino degrees of freedom contribution to the cosmological black body pressure ( meaning that the neutrinos really are in thermodynamic equilibrium when they uncouple ) .",
    "these assumptions , if incorrect , corrupt the processed data .",
    "data corruption is a very real problem in science .",
    "nature magazine has recently published evidence@xcite that the majority of biomedical experimental data is not reproducible .",
    "we call this ` corrupted data ' , or coda in this paper",
    ". coda also exists in the physics and astronomy community .",
    "coda can be further classified as class i : the raw data itself is corrupted , or class ii : the raw data is fine , but the processed final data is corrupted . a notable example in physics of a class i coda is the cern opera experiment that recorded neutrinos moving faster than light in a vacuum@xcite .",
    "this was a ` 10 sigma discovery ' , meaning that the purely statistical chance for all their recorded neutrinos moving faster than light in a vacuum was in the extremely rare tenth sigma probability occurrence . however , opera had a systematic error that made the statistical ten sigma error irrelevant .",
    "class ii coda can be extremely difficult to identify because the reasons for it can be wrong assumptions in processing the raw data , which the scientists believed were true . in astronomy ,",
    "coda is famously linked with cosmology@xcite . from nuclear and particle physics , we list three coda situations from a small four - year window in the middle 70s .    * _ large z muonic atoms _",
    "+ reference@xcite created large z muonic atoms and measured the cascade x - ray energies that occur as the muon descended the excited energy staircase . by concentrating on large orbital angular momentum states",
    ", they avoided the problem of knowing the protonic charge distribution in large z atoms .",
    "they were looking for violations of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) because the two - loop vacuum polarization term is important@xcite .",
    "having found a discrepancy between qed and their data , they declared the former broke down .",
    "this experiment was repeated by a different group@xcite who got agreement with the qed theoretical calculations and who concluded that in reference@xcite ` systematic errors were seriously under - estimated ' . * _ high - y anomaly in anti - neutrino scattering _ + in 1974 reference@xcite reported evidence of a ` high - y anomaly ' in anti - neutrino scattering which called into question weak interaction charge symmetry , left - handed currents and bjorken scaling .",
    "what makes this coda so interesting is that it spawned ` copy - cat ' results@xcite .",
    "anti - neutrino scattering was done by a later group@xcite who got agreement with the electro - weak theory and the parton model and who concluded ` there is no high - y anomaly ' .",
    "* violation of unitarity in k@xmath0   + unitarity in quantum mechanics basically means conservation of probability ; that is , summing all possibilities of branching ratios for a particle decay should equal 100% . in rare instances",
    ", unitarity sets a _",
    "lower _ bound to a branching ratio as it does@xcite for the decay k@xmath0 .",
    "an experiment testing unitarity was done by reference@xcite who found too few di - muon decays of k@xmath1 and conservation of probability was in doubt .",
    "an experiment was undetaken@xcite to check the claim of@xcite .",
    "the results of@xcite were in good agreement with the unitarity bound and in sharp disagreement with the claim , deciding that the probability that unitarity was violated is ` less than 0.06% ' .    in these examples , systematic errors caused both class i and class ii coda . in this paper",
    ", we critically examine three data sets in astronomy : planck satellite data analysis , n - body gravitational collapse simulations and galaxy cluster x - ray data .",
    "an assumption for the planck data analysis@xcite is that the cosmological neutrinos are in full thermal equilibrium prior to neutrino decoupling and posits equations for the radiation field thermodynamic temperature @xmath2 and density @xmath3 as ( the subscript @xmath4 is used to indicate neutrino quantities ) : @xmath5 are these assumed equations correct ?",
    "current experimental evidence@xcite suggests that neutrinos have masses @xmath6 2 ev / c@xmath7 , and small neutrino mass mixings ( implying near neutrino mass degeneracy ) .",
    "no evidence of the majorana neutrino type has been found to date .",
    "thus , if the present three neutrino flavors are indeed dirac neutrinos , they will possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment ( see for instance reference@xcite ) . whether such a dipole moment is anomalous or",
    "not , the early universe will induce non - equilibrium neutrino power radiation losses@xcite .",
    "relativistic magnetic moments radiate as @xmath8 , compared to the charged particle linard result @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the usual relativistic factor @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that a neutrino s radiation loss is not so much dependent on the scale of big bang magnetic fields as on their fluctuations ; that is , the continuous flipping back and forth of the dipole is a major determiner of their spontaneous radiation emission power loss . because the initial big bang will produce high magnitude , highly turbulent ( fluctuating ) plasmas@xcite , there will , in principle , be no limit to a neutrino s power loss .",
    "keeping neutrino degrees of freedom in the cosmological black - body microwave data reduction leads to tension between the planck consortium cosmological parameter values and their estimates from other independent methods@xcite .",
    "if neutrinos are removed from the cosmological microwave data , some other degree of freedom must replace their contributions to the perturbations on the acoustic peaks .",
    "reference@xcite shows that a cosmic magnetic field has the same contribution to the cosmic microwave background as kinetic degrees of freedom . by replacing neutrino degrees of freedom with magnetic field degrees of freedom ,",
    "it is expected that the cosmological microwave data will then lead to a value of the hubble constant that will be in line with values derived from its direct determination . as an added benefit",
    ", the early universe magnetic fields will lead to remnant , vestigial intergalactic magnetic fields seen today@xcite .",
    "the assumption that cosmological neutrinos in the early universe are in thermodynamic equilibrium with baryonic matter can not be maintained if neutrinos are only of the dirac type .",
    "if neutrinos lose their energy through radiation power losses in the early universe , cold neutrinos will condense .",
    "cnos satisfy all of the requirements for dark matter by virtue of the modern theory of the electro - weak force and the present neutrino mass bound : their hydrostatic equilibrium produces sizes that are millions of parsecs in radius and thousands of times more massive than the milky way , in a single object .",
    "they are so large they easily embed a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies .",
    "if that were to happen , the embedded galaxies would undergo simple harmonic motion within the cno@xcite .",
    "a cno would be totally transparent to light : one can see right through them . the non - equilibrium neutrino radiation loss and",
    "the initial phases of condensation should appear as hot spots in the cosmological microwave radiation .",
    "a significant difference between charged matter and neutrino matter is the following : the big bang will have created equal parts of matter and anti - matter , but the near - annihilation of charged matter by its anti - matter counter - part will produce a reduced baryonic matter density ( ` baryon asymmetry problem ' ) .",
    "however , since neutrinos hardly annihilate with their anti - neutrinos , the present day universe should have essentially the original numbers of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "this difference of interaction causes a large energy density disparity between charged matter and neutrino matter .",
    "thus cnos satisfy the dark matter energy density prominence over charged matter .",
    "the equation of state for a cno reference@xcite is exceedingly concise : a relativistic fermi gas with degeneracy of 6 .",
    "thus , a hydrostatic solution for condensed neutrinos has just two parameters : @xmath12 ( hereafter just @xmath13 ) the common neutrino and anti - neutrino degenerate mass ( called the ` common degenerate neutrino mass ' ) and the fermi momentum @xmath14 at the center of the cno , @xmath15 .",
    "these quantities enter in the ratio @xmath16mc where c is the speed of light .",
    "the relevant astronomical cno configurations have @xmath17 .      in fig . 1",
    ", we present cno solutions for @xmath18 mass .",
    "this is the signature of a cno : higher mass cnos have smaller radii .",
    "in fact , all fermi degenerate objects ( neutron stars and white dwarfs ) have the property that the more massive the object is , the smaller in size it becomes .",
    "this stands in stark contrast to hot gases , plasmas and iron - silicate equations of state , all of which have positive gradient mass versus radius .",
    "it presents a unique identifier for degenerate matter .",
    "= 1.0 ev , where the radius is in mpc and the mass is in @xmath19 solar masses .",

    "this signature has the approximate parameterization ( see appendix ) for general @xmath13 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass of the cno having radius @xmath23 in units ( mpc ) and @xmath13 is the common degenerate neutrino mass in units ev / c@xmath7 .",
    "eq(3 ) is not exact , but reasonable .",
    "we generate the density profiles for astronomically relevant solutions in fig .",
    "2 .     mass 0.8 ev / c@xmath7 . ]",
    "physics based numerical n - body simulations have been used in attempts to identify the gravitational contribution to dwarf galaxy halos and clusters of galaxies halos from cold dark matter@xcite . however",
    ", if dark matter is degenerate , these numerical profiles would then be based on an incorrect assumption . to see this ,",
    "the nfw profile is derived as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are parameters .",
    "the highly peaked nature of this density function is incorrect for degenerate fermi matter , because degenerate fermi matter has a finite fermi momentum at the center ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in actual fact , n - body simulations of classical matter will never give degenerate matter unless it is included as a required constraint .",
    "monte carlo simulations of degenerate matter is possible if this constraint is implemented@xcite .",
    "most of the available cold dark matter virial mass and radii data for galaxies are derived from the temperatures of x - rays obtained from x - ray satellites . in order for this to happen",
    ", hydrostatic thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed .",
    "there are potential statistical errors associated with deriving masses and radii of dark matter in this manner , which we discuss in this section . however , the method turns out to have a bias which is only evident when one plots the totality of the data .    *",
    "dark matter does not radiate so the center of the dark matter object is difficult to determine",
    ". the embedded galaxies may be in simple harmonic motion@xcite and thus the center of the galaxy cluster need not correspond to the center of the dark matter s distribution .",
    "displaced dark matter centers will then show an erroneous , spurious ` cooling ' center ( smaller kev temperature ) , leading to an error in the actual radius of the dark matter object . *",
    "the assumption that the hot x - ray cluster gas is in thermal equilibrium leads to the suspect equation@xcite : @xmath28}{dr } \\stackrel{{\\rm ? } } { = } -\\frac{gm(<r)}{r^{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the proton mass , @xmath30 is the electron density and @xmath31 is the average molecular weight for hydrogen .",
    "the hot gas has a long cooling time@xcite and is also executing simple harmonic motion in the dark matter potential well .",
    "there is no requirement at all for stability against gravitational collapse .",

    "* the gas is hot because it fell down a potential well so the following equation may look attractive : @xmath32    however , the gas may have had additional heat injection@xcite ( quasars , supernovae , active galactic nuclei , etc . ) and/or had significant kinetic energy before it fell into the gravitational potential well ; the latter could be epoch - dependent . while authors attempt to correct for these effects , these unknown correction terms likely lead to erroneous results for dark matter virial mass",
    ".    these potential errors may be completely over - shadowed by the hydrostatic thermodynamic equilibrium assumption . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the data from virial masses and radii from the fermi@xcite and chandra satellites@xcite .",
    "the error bars for the fermi satellite data are not shown for ease of viewing .",
    "also , the paper of reference@xcite has been corrected due to an important typographical mistake .",
    "figure 3 does not show the trend of large virial mass , small radius that is the smoking gun of fermi degenerate matter ; instead , it shows large virial mass with large radius .",
    "_ this is the equation of state for a plasma . _",
    "the input assumption of a hot gas in hydrostatic thermodynamic equilibrium producing an output result of a plasma equation of state is a spectacular example of circular reasoning .",
    "circular reasoning is the systematic error of the processed data . what should have been the assumption for the hot gas ?",
    "reference@xcite showed that galaxies embedded in dark matter actually undergo simple harmonic motion ( shm ) .",
    "thus , the hot gas within the same gravitational potential well may also be expected to undego the same motions .    for these reasons , we turn to the more direct methods of obtaining ( cold ) dark matter virial mass and radii .",
    "our literature search left us with only a few weak lensing candidates and a single sunyeav - zeldovich method candidate .",
    "we elected to not use strong lensing data in order to minimize the potential source of error from attempting to determine these virial values from an observed arc versus the entire ellipse .",
    "the size of a cno means that only clusters of galaxies will realistically be available as profilers .",
    "we are interested in the virial mass and the virial radius of galaxy clusters , and to see if the relation between them follows the cno signature of degenerate fermi matter , as shown in fig .",
