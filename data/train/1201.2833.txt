    "an electromagnetic cloak is a device that minimizes or even nullifies the effects of scattering from various objects by rendering them electromagnetically invisible to a detector .",
    "one well - known cloaking technique is the so - called `` transformation - optics '' method @xcite which uses strongly inhomogeneous and highly anisotropic materials to perform complex transformations for the incident wave .",
    "another cloaking technique is based on the cancellation of the scattering effects of a magnetodielectric object with a suitable metamaterial or plasmonic cladding @xcite , which neutralizes the polarization current of the primary scatterer .",
    "unfortunately , the actual construction of a cloaking device is very difficult with both the aforementioned approaches .",
    "suggestions to overcome such a drawback includes , e.g. , the use of transmission - line networks or other waveguiding structures instead of fictitious materials with exotic properties .",
    "@xcite with transmission - line networks , the object to be electromagnetically hidden is strongly limited in size and geometry , @xcite but cloaking of impenetrable ( e.g. , perfectly metallic ) objects has been shown to be possible with a set of conical conducting plates placed around a cylindrical cloaked region .",
    "@xcite this metal - plate cloaking has been practically realized in microwaves and numerically proven to be functional for a wide band of optical frequencies.@xcite however , the underlying theory and the physical principles that govern the related phenomena have not been yet thoroughly understood .    in this work , we introduce a new , simple , nonmagnetic cloak .",
    "the idea originates from an analytical model of the previously reported metal - plate cloak operating in the visible range .",
    "@xcite the used model is a simple mathematical concept comprised of multiple concentric cylinders of different dielectric permittivities .",
    "the choice of the permittivities has been made by considering the tapered conical lines , under the related plane - wave excitation , as a series connection of capacitors .",
    "the analytically evaluated response of the described model is shown to have a remarkable coincidence with the corresponding results obtained from full - wave simulations of the actual device for various values of input parameters .",
    "since the aforementioned simple model appears to resemble so successfully the real - world metal - plate cloaking structure , we tried to adopt an even simpler concept to cloak an impenetrable , perfectly electrically conducting ( pec ) volume .",
    "this is a clearly more challenging case since one can hide practically anything in a pec volume by avoiding to interact with the environment , which does not happen for penetrable objects .",
    "we introduce uniform or layered dielectric claddings which are optimized by sweeping the relative permittivity values of these covers .",
    "the scattering reduction achieved by the proposed devices is quite high , given their simple structure .",
    "moreover , the demonstrated cloaking bandwidths can be considered as wide , a property attributed to the fact that the materials required in the claddings are simple dielectrics with relative permittivities larger than unity .",
    "it should be noted that most other cloaking methods for pec objects , discussed in the literature , require magnetic material properties .",
    "the proposed model to mimic the physical mechanism of wave propagation in metal - plate devices is fairly simple and its configuration is shown in fig .",

    "the internal cylinder , which corresponds to the region @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , can be either penetrable with relative dielectric constant @xmath12 or pec .",

    "the constructing material of the plates is silver , the ( optimal ) operating frequency @xmath48 thz , while the physical dimensions are given by : @xmath49 nm , @xmath50 nm , @xmath51 nm , @xmath52 nm and @xmath53 nm . it should be stressed that the cloaked region is filled with silver too , while the frequency - dependent permittivity of this substance @xmath54 is well known .",
    "@xcite note that the permittivity of silver is negative close to @xmath55 , namely : @xmath56\\cong-10 $ ] .    with reference to the model analyzed above ,",
    "we make use of the formulas corresponding to a dielectric core since the region @xmath10 is solid silver ; therefore , @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1-th layer is the air gap ; thus , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is apparent that our model does not take into account the periodic dimension variation of the actual configuration with respect to @xmath20 , since the stack of conical plates is replaced by a structure of homogeneous concentric cylinders .",
    "however , the radial inhomogeneity ( contrary to the axial one ) of the cloaking device is possible to be imitated by choosing properly the dielectric permittivities of the cylindrical layers . but how can one compute @xmath4 for @xmath60 in a correct and reliable way ?    in fig .",
    "[ sideview ] , one observes the side view of half the biconical cell as the shape possesses cylindrical symmetry .",
    "assume that the cylindrical layer in the vicinity of the representative surface @xmath61 ( containing both the corresponding vacuum aperture and the related solid silver plates ) , would be replaced by a ( locally ) homogeneous dielectric , with the same external dimensions , of relative permittivity @xmath4 , whose value should be estimated . from the similarity of triangles ,",
    "the height @xmath62 of the representative vacuum aperture is found equal to : @xmath63 if the inclination of the tapered plates is relatively low ( which is the case for the specific choice of @xmath64 ) , then the @xmath20-polarized electric field will be almost normal to the sloping boundaries separating the silver from the vacuum . as a result",
    ", the arbitrary cross section at @xmath61 can be considered as a series connection of three capacitors : two with the height @xmath65 filled with silver and one ( placed in between ) with height @xmath62 filled with vacuum . accordingly , this serial cluster can be replaced by a single capacitor with a dielectric material of relative permittivity @xmath4 , based on the well - known equivalent capacitance formula : @xmath66 . in this sense , the rigorous expression for @xmath4 is hyperbolic with respect to both @xmath67 , @xmath62 and is given as follows : @xmath68 we use layers of the same thickness ( due to the constant inclination of the silver conical plates ) , namely : @xmath69 for @xmath60 . after having defined all the parameters of the theoretical structure ( @xmath70 ) based on the actual quantities of the real configuration ( @xmath71 )",
    ", we can develop the corresponding model and quantify its efficiency .",
    "it is remarkable that ( for the given ranges of the input parameters ) all the relative permittivities @xmath4 are positive and greater than unity .    a crucial quantity for the operation and the performance of a cloaking device is the total scattering width of the whole cylindrical structure normalized by the corresponding width of the uncloaked one .",
    "the smaller is the magnitude , the better the device serves its purpose .",
    "the quantity is defined by : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a sufficiently large integer to achieve convergence for the series and @xmath74 denote the coefficients of the scattering field for the uncloaked cylinder . in fig .",
    "[ figa ] we show the variation of @xmath75 with respect to the operating frequency for two alternative heights @xmath53 and @xmath76 nm . in each case",
    ", we perform a numerical simulation of the actual metal - plate device with ansys hfss full - wave software .",
    "@xcite the obtained numerical results are compared to those derived through implementation of the corresponding multi - layered analytical model , in the way described above .",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the two sets of data despite the fact that they describe two completely different structures ( simulation of an axially inhomogeneous real device and rigorous solution to an axially homogeneous multilayered configuration ) .",
    "this remarkable coincidence between so dissimilar configurations demonstrates the success of the adopted model .",
    "when it comes to the results themselves , there are large frequency bands where the magnitude @xmath75 takes values much smaller than unity . in addition , the metal - plate cloaking for @xmath76 nm is functional at larger frequencies than the device with @xmath53 nm does .    in the considered numerical example , the electrical dimension of the structure is relatively small which could make one think that just the omnidirectional ( @xmath77 ) term of the sums in ( [ eq : totalscatteringwidth ] ) , is sufficient to evaluate the quantity @xmath75 .",
    "if such an argument was correct , then the cloaking behavior demonstrated above would be attributed to the well - known `` scattering cancellation '' phenomenon . @xcite we believe that this is not the case since the electrical size of the structure is not so small . to support this statement",
    ", we assume the corresponding `` scattering cancellation '' device for the silver cloaked object of radius @xmath42 .",
    "this is a homogeneous cladding of relative permittivity @xmath78 and radius @xmath41 without an air gap . in fig .",
    "[ figg ] , we evaluate the normalized total scattering width @xmath75 from ( [ eq : totalscatteringwidth ] ) as function of @xmath78 for several truncation limits @xmath73 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the interval @xmath79 where smaller @xmath75 are observed and it is clear that for @xmath80 , the result does not change significantly .",
    "however , the first harmonic ( @xmath81 ) is necessary to be included in the computation since the zeroth term is minimized ( and more specifically nullified ) at larger @xmath78 .",
    "the nullification of the omnidirectional term is the `` scattering cancellation '' solution and it is different from the observed one .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , a multilayer as well as a single layer dielectric cover can be used to reduce the scattering from a cylinder composed of an @xmath78negative material .",
    "the same can be of course achieved by using the well - known `` scattering cancellation method '' . however , this technique has not been used so far to hide a conducting object by a layered or a uniform cover made of dielectrics with @xmath82 . here",
    "we show , by using the analytical model described in section  ii , that such a case is possible at least for conducting cylinders of moderate electrical size .",
    "the electromagnetic fields weakly penetrate the cloaked silver cylinder studied in the previous section , so it is expected that also conducting cylinders , i.e. , impenetrable objects , could also be partially cloaked with simple multilayer or even uniform covers . to present a generalized case , in the following we normalize the dimensions and the results to the free - space wavelength @xmath83 .",
    "we study an electrically thin , pec cylinder with radius @xmath84 ( the electrical size of this cylinder is of the same order as the cloaked object in the previous section ) .",
    "we assign a dielectric cover around this cylinder and consider three cases : ( i ) a uniform cover with constant @xmath78 , ( ii ) a multilayer cover with linearly varying @xmath4 , ( iii ) a multilayer cover with hyperbolically varying @xmath4 ( as in ( [ eq : equivalentpermittivity ] ) ) . for simplicity , we choose @xmath85 in all the studied cases .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be made freely ; the resulting value of ( optimal ) @xmath86 of the cover material simply changes if the values of @xmath42 and @xmath41 are changed .    in the first case , we assign a constant @xmath78 to the material surrounding the pec cylinder . the analytical model of section  ii is used to optimize the value of @xmath78 ( see fig .  [ epsr_opt1 ] ) .",
    "it is evident that for these values of @xmath42 and @xmath41 , the optimal value is @xmath87 and with that , the normalized total scattering width of the cloaked pec cylinder is slightly less than 0.4 , i.e. , the cloak reduces the total scattering width @xmath75 of the pec cylinder by more than 60  % .",
    "the frequency dependence of the normalized total scattering width is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ constant_epsr ] , demonstrating a reasonably broadband cloaking effect : the relative bandwidth where the total scattering width of the pec cylinder is reduced to the half or less , is about 21  % .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that moderate losses do not deteriorate the cloaking effect ; with a loss tangent of 0.01 , the cloaking effect is actually slightly improved compared to the lossless case .    in the second scenario , we model the case of fig .",
    "[ modelgeometry ] for @xmath88 and the value of @xmath4 depending on the layer number @xmath89 linearly . to find the optimal values of @xmath4 for cloaking at @xmath55 , we plot @xmath75 as a function of @xmath90 , i.e. , the maximum value of @xmath78 , while @xmath4 ( for @xmath91 ) is linearly decreasing from @xmath90 to @xmath9 .",
    "the result shown in fig .",
    "[ epsr_opt2 ] demonstrates that for the chosen dimensions @xmath42 and @xmath41 , the lowest positive value of @xmath90 , corresponding to a minimum in the normalized total scattering width , is @xmath92 . in that case",
    ", the relative permittivities of the five - layer cloak are as shown in table  i.    .values of relative permittivities with linearly changing @xmath78 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing the three curves of fig .",
    "[ varying_epsr ] , we can conclude that changing the profile of @xmath4 from constant to linear and hyperbolic , improves the obtained scattering reduction at the frequency @xmath93 , but at the same time , the bandwidth of efficient cloaking decreases .",
    "concerning practical issues , the constant and linear profiles are easily realizable ( the required values of @xmath4 are feasible ) , whereas the hyperbolic profile is far from practical .",
    "however , the cloaking performance with the constant profile is not much different from the linear profile , so it may not be worth the increased complexity to use even the linear one .",
    "it is clear that cloaking of pec objects with simple dielectric covers is far from ideal cloaking such that is in theory possible with , e.g. , `` transformation - optics '' .",
    "however , it is evident that the cloaking efficiencies presented in this work , are comparable to the experimental and numerical results obtained with various other cloaking techniques that have been realized with composite metamaterials .",
    "we have presented a very simple analytical concept , based on transfer matrices at multilayered cylindrical structures .",
    "it has been found that this model describes accurately the previously reported cloaking effect obtained with conical silver plates in the visible frequency range .",
    "the effectiveness of the analytical model is verified by comparing the results of the normalized total scattering widths originating from it , to results obtained by numerical simulation software .",
    "the fidelity of the proposed concept allows it to be used in device design and to save computational resources due to its simplicity .",
    "the same analytical model is also used to demonstrate that , surprisingly , cloaking of impenetrable ( perfectly conducting ) objects is possible with simple dielectric covers whose relative permittivity surpasses unity .",
    "such a property renders this type of electromagnetic configurations easily realizable , unlike most other cloaking devices reported in the literature .",
