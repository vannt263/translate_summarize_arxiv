    "distinct surface - electronic properties , potentially relevant for spintronic applications , arise from the strong spin - orbit interaction in three - dimensional topological insulators ( 3dtis ) @xcite .",
    "although the bulk electronic structure of these materials resembles that of standard band insulators with electronic bands separated by an energy gap , the valence and conduction bands of the surface states form a conical dispersion and touch at the center of the surface brillouin zone .",
    "these gapless surface states lack the standard twofold spin degeneracy , they are protected against backscattering , and the spin orientation of each plane - wave surface state is determined unambiguously by its momentum vector .    in the past few years , surface - sensitive experimental techniques",
    "have been utilized to explore the remarkable properties of the surface electrons in 3dtis .",
    "the linear , dirac - cone - like electronic dispersion and deviations from that were observed in various 3dti materials using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite ( arpes ) , and the correlation between spin and momentum was demonstrated by the spin - resolved version of the same technique @xcite .",
    "the role of electron scattering off pointlike impurities and line defects on 3dti surfaces , highly relevant for future attempts to design electronic devices based on these materials , has been studied via scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite . in the vicinity of obstacles on the surface ,",
    "characteristic standing wave patterns are formed due to the interference of initial and final scattering states @xcite .",
    "these electronic standing waves contribute to the local density of states ( local dos , ldos ) , therefore real - space mapping of them is possible via stm .",
    "theories describing the standing waves on 3dti surfaces have also been formulated recently @xcite .",
    "a line defect has translational symmetry in the direction it stretches along , hence the electronic standing waves in its vicinity are essentially one - dimensional ( 1d ) , ( i.e. , the ldos varies only along the axis perpendicular to the line defect ) .",
    "this simple 1d character of the induced ldos pattern implies a relatively straightforward experimental and theoretical analysis of the effect , which serves as a strong motivation to consider such arrangements .",
    "a line defect arises naturally at the edge of a step formed by an extra crystal layer on the surface , @xcite hence this 1d setup is accessible experimentally .",
    "information on the electronic system can be extracted from the asymptotic decay exponent and wave number of ldos oscillation around line defects .",
    "theoretical results @xcite indicate that the ldos oscillations on the surface of a 3dti , asymptotically far from a line defect and within the energy range of linear dispersion , decay with the distance @xmath2 from the defect as @xmath3 .",
    "this decay exponent is in contrast with the @xmath4 decay seen in a standard two - dimensional electron gas , @xcite and arises as a consequence of the absence of backscattering characteristic of surface electrons in 3dtis .",
    "recent stm data agrees with this prediction .",
    "@xcite the wave vector of the asymptotic ldos oscillations is usually equal to the distance between nesting segments of the constant - energy contour ( cec ) , which is the diameter of the fermi circle in the above - mentioned case .",

    "we describe the effect in an exact scattering - theory framework @xcite , yielding results that are not restricted to the spatial region asymptotically far from the defect , but hold also in the vicinity thereof .",
    "this enables us to directly compare our results with experimental data , the latter being usually taken close to the defect where features of the ldos are most pronounced . in the energy range of strong hexagonal warping , we identify a significant pre - asymptotic contribution to the ldos oscillations , with wave number quantitatively matching that of a recent experiment @xcite .",

    "[ fig : results]b may also induce ldos oscillations with wave number @xmath95@xcite . however , in our model we find that such oscillations do not exist , due to the exact cancellation of contributions from reflected and transmitted waves incident from the @xmath44 and @xmath60 regions , respectively ( see sec .",
