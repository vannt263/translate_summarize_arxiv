    "half - metallic materials are favorable candidates for spintronic applications because of a gap in one spin channel , leading to full spin polarization at the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "thus , large tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) ratios can be obtained .",
    "this effect is observed in magnetic tunnel junctions , consisting of two ferromagnetic films separated by a thin insulator .",
    "the tmr ratio is defined by ( r@xmath7-r@xmath8)/r@xmath8 , where r@xmath8 and r@xmath7 denote the resistivity in parallel and antiparallel magnetization alignment , respectively .",
    "half - metallicity has been predicted for many materials such as la@xmath9sr@xmath10mno@xmath11 @xcite , cro@xmath12 @xcite , and many heusler compounds @xcite .",
    "especially co based heusler compounds are suitable for commercial applications because of their high curie temperatures .",
    "a ternary heusler compound is represented by the formula x@xmath12yz , in which x and y are transition metals and z is a main group element .",
    "these crystallize in one of two possible fully ordered fcc structures with a four - atom basis : an ordinary ( l2@xmath13 ) structure and an inverse structure ( x@xmath14 ) with a different occupation sequence @xcite .",
    "the prototype of the l2@xmath13 structure is the original heusler compound cu@xmath12mnal ( space group fm@xmath15 m ) @xcite .",
    "the occupation sequence is in the l2@xmath13 case x - y - x - z with respect to the sublattices a(@xmath16 ) , b(@xmath17 ) , c(@xmath18 ) , and d(@xmath19 ) .",
    "the condition for a compound to crystallize in the x@xmath14 structure is that element x is less electronegative than element y. within one row of the periodic table , this is the case when the atomic number of y is higher than that of x @xcite .",
    "the prototypes for this structure are hg@xmath12cuti and li@xmath12agsb @xcite .",
    "no inversion symmetry is present and the symmetry is lowered to f@xmath20 m .",
    "the occupation of the sublattices is y - x - x - z , with the two x - atoms at inequivalent positions in the lattice .",
    "here we study thin films with compositions between co@xmath12fesi and fe@xmath12cosi , which crystallize in the regular heusler and inverse heusler structures , respectively @xcite . according to band structure calculations , these materials should have ( pseudo-)gaps in the minority states , such that the fermi energy is close to the flat valence bands in fe@xmath12cosi @xcite and close to the flat conduction bands in co@xmath12fesi @xcite .",
    "we thus follow the idea of fermi energy adjustment by electron doping @xcite to move the fermi energy away from the flat bands , as to increase the tmr .",
    "this is expected in the fe@xmath0co@xmath1si series under the assumption of an ideal substitution of fe at the c site with co. furthermore , the lattice constant is expected to remain constant in this series , so lattice mismatches with the substrate or the tunneling barrier should not vary .",
    "the films were deposited in a dc / rf magnetron co - sputtering system with a typical base pressure of @xmath21 mbar .",
    "the ar pressure during sputtering was @xmath22 mbar .",
    "all films were deposited on mgo ( 001 ) substrates ( lattice parameter : 4.21 ) covered by a 5 nm thick mgo and a 5 nm thick cr seed layer .",
    "the seed layers were _ in situ _ annealed at @xmath23c to obtain smooth surfaces .",
    "afterwards , epitaxial fe@xmath0co@xmath1si films were grown by co - sputtering from elemental targets at room temperature .",

    "co@xmath12fesi and fe@xmath46co@xmath47si reach an @xmath34 of nearly unity at @xmath48c .",

    "the ordering systematically decreases with increasing fe concentration . the d - b and d - a , c ordering parameters are shown in figure [ s_vs_x_graph ] as a function of x for @xmath48c .",
    "co@xmath12fesi shows overall the best atomic ordering .",
    "@xmath35 drops with increasing fe concentration , which indicates increasing fe(b)-si disorder as fe@xmath12cosi is approached . for fe@xmath12cosi , this translates to a si occupancy of 6.5% on the a , c sites each , and 21% on the b sites .",
    "accordingly , the d site has 66% si occupancy , where 25% would mean completely random distribution .",
    "the influence of post - annealing on the tmr is studied with subsequent annealing of patterned samples in a magnetic field of 0.1 t for 60min .",
    "the tmr ratio vs. annealing temperature for all stoichiometries is shown in figure [ tmrta_graph ] .",
    "the tmr data were in all cases taken at a bias voltage of 10mv .",
    "the error bars are estimated from the standard deviation of the tmr values of at least ten elements",
    ". a maximum room temperature tmr ratio of 159% was achieved for fe@xmath47co@xmath46si at @xmath49c .",
    "the tmr vs. @xmath31 curves are quite different for the various stoichiometries . for fe@xmath12cosi and fe@xmath47co@xmath46si , they are very similar and start with a tmr ratio of about @xmath50 at @xmath51 annealing temperature , which increases up to 159% for fe@xmath47co@xmath46si .",
    "the fe@xmath12cosi compound also reaches the highest tmr ratio of 147% at 375@xmath36c post - annealing temperature . with further increased annealing temperature",
    ", the tmr values decrease to ratios below those at 300@xmath36c .",
    "the increasing tmr ratio for temperatures @xmath42375@xmath36c points to an improving spin polarization due to a better crystallinity of the heusler electrode and perhaps to a more crystallized tunneling barrier .",
    "the decreasing tmr ratio for annealing temperatures above @xmath52c is well known and arises from mn interdiffusion out of the mnir counter electrode into the cofe electrode and its interface to the mgo barrier @xcite .",
    "the mn destroys the magnetic and electronic structure of the cofe , resulting in a decreasing tmr ratio .",
    "a slightly different behavior can be found for the fe@xmath46co@xmath47si tunneling element .",
    "the tmr ratio remains constant for 300@xmath36c@xmath53375@xmath36c and starts to decrease at temperatures higher than 375@xmath36c .",
    "the reason for this is again the mn diffusion .",
    "the fact that the tmr ratio remains constant indicates that opposing effects may be present : although the d - a , c ordering parameter increases , the tmr ratio stays constant .",
    "it is also possible ( but unlikely ) that the crystallinity of the barrier does not change for these compositions , microstructural analysis would be required to assess this conjecture .    the tunnel junction based on the co@xmath12fesi",
    "film exhibits different behavior : the maximum tmr ratio of 118% is already reached at @xmath54c . for higher temperatures , the tmr ratio decreases , although the d - a , c ordering strongly increases between 325@xmath36c and 375@xmath36c .",
    "we can not explain this decrease with the mn diffusion , which starts not before @xmath49c in the other samples .",
    "this suggests that the spin polarization _ reduces intrinsically as crystallinity is improved _ ( with respect to the d - a , c ordering ) .",
    "this finding agrees with earlier investigations of co@xmath12fesi based mtjs with alo@xmath55 barriers , which have found a spin polarization that is considerably lower than that of co@xmath12mnsi @xcite .",
    "c for co@xmath12fesi , fe@xmath46co@xmath47si and fe@xmath56co@xmath56si and @xmath52c for fe@xmath47co@xmath46si and fe@xmath12cosi .",

    "the tmr versus temperature dependence is presented in figure [ tmr - t ] a ) .",
    "the mtj based on the fe@xmath47co@xmath46si heusler film shows a tmr ratio of 262% at 15k and 159% at room temperature , respectively .",
    "figure [ tmr - t ] b ) shows the corresponding major - loops .",
    "the scaling factor tmr(15k)/tmr(290k ) is about @xmath57 for all samples .",
    "drewello _ et al .",
    "_ reported tmr ratios of @xmath58 at room temperature and @xmath59 at 13k for co@xmath12fesi based mtjs with mgo barrier and co@xmath25fe@xmath26 counter electrode @xcite .",
    "the enhanced tmr ratio in the present work is attributed to better film growth because of the cr buffer . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio was tmr(15k)/tmr(290k)=1.7 , which is close to the values observed here .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , we have observed the highest tmr obtained with a co@xmath12fesi / mgo / cofe junction .",
    "higher ratios with a co@xmath12fesi electrode have only been obtained with a cofeb counter - electrode @xcite .",
    "figure [ tmr_v_graph ] depicts the voltage dependence of the tmr for all stoichiometries measured at @xmath60k .",
    "the curves are normalized to the tmr at zero bias . with the exception of",
    "fe@xmath12cosi the curves are similar to each other and resemble those obtained for many heusler compounds .",
    "the voltage required to reduce the tmr to the half zero - bias value is between 400mv and 500mv .",
    "the result for fe@xmath12cosi shows a slower decay of the tmr with increasing bias voltage , and a small bump at around -0.8v .",
    "the question if these features can be attributed to band structure effects is subject of ongoing work .",
    "for the first time , magnetic tunnel junctions based on an inverse heusler compound have been prepared .",
    "we have investigated the crystallographic and transport properties of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si based magnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "high tmr ratios were obtained for the intermediate stoichiometry fe@xmath47co@xmath46si .",
    "this can be attributed to an adjustment of the fermi energy within a minority spin pseudogap . for this case , we have observed a correlation between the long - range ordering parameters and the tmr as a function of the annealing temperature . in the co@xmath12fesi case , however , no such correlation was observed , which indicates a low intrinsic spin polarization , in agreement with earlier reports .",
