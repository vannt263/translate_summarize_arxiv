    "effective potential depends on the eigenvalues of the mass matrix , which can become complicated non - polynomial functions of the fields if there are no simplifying symmetries @xcite .",
    "the gw approach addresses this complexity , but is limited to weakly coupled theories @xcite which may preclude studies of interesting symmetry - breaking scenarios and standard - model extensions @xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable to generalize the gw method to avoid the weak - coupling limitation .",
    "the original cw analysis with the standard model higgs scalar field was based on this weak - coupling assumption , leading to a light higgs mass of approximately @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "however , the weak - coupling limit in cw analysis of the standard model can be addressed by a full leading - logarithm rg analysis , increasing the higgs mass prediction @xcite .",
    "similarly , the weak - coupling limitation of the gw approach , which is the generalization of cw model to incorporate extra scalar fields , can be addressed by multi - scale rg methods . for the model introduced in section [ multi_scale_section ] ,",
    "the multi - scale rg method requires two renormalization scales @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( i.e. , one for each coupling ) @xcite . in the limit when @xmath88 the multi - scale method reverts to conventional single - scale rg techniques .",
    "the presence of a second renormalization scale gives the freedom to choose a special relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath27 to constrain the couplings to satisfy @xmath89 , leading to an @xmath1-symmetric version of the lagrangian and resulting in a simplified logarithmic term in the one - loop level effective potential .",
    "by contrast to conventional ( single - scale ) rg methods where the @xmath89 constraint may be satisfied at a certain fixed scale , with multiple scales the constraint will be satisfied along a particular trajectory in the @xmath90 plane .",
    "because the effective potential will satisfy a modified rg equation along this @xmath1-symmetric trajectory , we can exploit rg methods to analyze the effective potential along this trajectory .",
    "we can then use rg invariance to map the predictions from the symmetric trajectory to obtain the physical content of the model for a conventional ( single ) renormalization scale .",
    "thus instead of a complicated and possibly intractable effective potential in the single - scale rg approach , we simplify the analysis of the effective potential on the symmetric rg trajectory and the challenges are shifted to obtaining the multi - scale rg functions on the symmetric rg trajectory and the process of mapping back to the physical single - scale trajectory .",
    "however , because this mapping is governed by both the single- and multi - scale rg functions , the procedure is well - established and has no inherent challenges .",
    "it should be noted that the multiple renormalization scales can also be attached to the kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation of this approach in a generalized @xmath91 model discussed later will be difficult since it does not provide enough renormalization scales , which leads to insufficient freedom to choose a special relationship between the scales to constrain the couplings .",
    "thus , the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite will be employed , with each renormalization scale attached to one coupling .",
    "we begin by studying the conformal ( massless ) version of the model given in eq .   with multiple renormalization scales",

    "by contrast with a single renormalization scale , where a variety of ways for introducing the scale will lead to the the same result because there is only a single dimensionless combination possible for the logarithms resulting from , a more systematic approach is needed for multiple renormalization . including the tree - level contribution @xmath101 into the effective potential @xmath102 using the relation between the bare and renormalized couplings ( note that the anomalous field dimension is zero at one - loop order , so the bare and renormalized fields are identical ) , and expanding to appropriate order in the couplings and in @xmath32 to obtain all finite terms , gives @xmath103 \\label{a_lambda } \\\\",

    ", demonstrate that our calculations are self - consistent .",
    "the typical strategy for analyzing effective potentials is to choose a renormalization scale where the logarithmic terms are zero ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , even with multiple renormalization scales this is not possible because of the complicated field dependence of the eigenvalues @xmath100 , and thus a more sophisticated implementation of the multi - scale rg methods is needed .",
    "we can simplify the eigenvalues @xmath100 by exploiting the additional degree of freedom provided by the multi - scale rg to choose a special relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath27 to constrain the couplings @xmath108 and @xmath109 to fulfill @xmath110 such that the tree - level lagrangian has @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "then the simplified eigenvalues @xmath111 and @xmath112 become @xmath113 using these eigenvalues , rearranging the logarithms in via @xmath114 , and ignoring counter - terms ( which could thus contain coefficients with explicit @xmath115 dependence ) , the one - loop effective potential for the constrained rg trajectory becomes @xmath116 thus along the symmetric rg trajectory , the effective potential assumes the simplified gw form @xcite , but with no implicit small - coupling assumptions .",
    "finally , by using the scheme transformation @xcite @xmath117 we obtain the cw form of the effective potential along the symmetric rg trajectory at leading - logatrithm order @xmath118 \\label{v_cw}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath119 are functions of the renormalized coupling @xmath23 .",
    "these coefficients can be determined from the renormalization group equation @xcite .",
    "although eq .   superficially resembles an effective potential for an @xmath1-symmetric @xmath120 theory , the imprint of the underlying original theory is contained in the rg functions which must be modified to reflect the effect of both the symmetric rg trajectory and the scheme transformation .    from section  [ multi_scale_section ] , we already know how each coupling runs with the scales @xmath121 .",
    "however , we have chosen a particular trajectory in the @xmath122 plane to simplify the form of the effective potential and we need to know how the couplings @xmath123 run on this symmetric trajectory .",
    "thus we have : @xmath124 @xmath125 for the anomalous dimension we have @xmath126 where @xmath127 is determined from the symmetry constraint and @xmath128 is determined from eq .  . in particular , we find @xmath129 by using eq .  , the above expression can be simplified to @xmath130 inputting eqs .   and into eqs .   and",
    ", we have @xmath131 we can now impose the constraint that defines the symmetric trajectory to obtain @xmath132 we speculate that the simple relationship is a one - loop artifact , and would become non - trivial at higher - loop order .    as outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite , effective potentials of the @xmath1 form are best analyzed by choosing the scale @xmath133 , which results in predictions of the coupling @xmath134 and scalar mass @xmath135 ( i.e. , the mass matrix is diagonal ) .",
    "it should be noted that vacuum expectation value @xmath136 is a physical rg - invariant observable .",
    "however , these predictions from the symmetric rg trajectory must be mapped back to physical values in the original theory for a conventional single - renormalization scale .",
    "we describe this process in general , keeping in mind that the one - loop case has a number of simplifications including and trivial anomalous dimensions for the fields .",
    "although the effective potential has an @xmath1-symmetric form along the symmetric trajectory , it is important to recognize that the vacuum configuration of the original theory retains its imprint along the symmetric trajectory through the vacuum angle @xmath137 .    first , consider a geometric description of the constraint defining the symmetric rg trajectory .",
    "the multi - scale couplings @xmath138 and @xmath139 can be represented by surfaces parameterized by the renormalization scales @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the constraint represents an intersection of surfaces defining a three - dimensional curve , whose projection onto the @xmath140 plane represents the symmetric rg trajectory .",
    "the single - scale limit @xmath88 defines the physical rg trajectory , and the symmetric and physical trajectories intersect at the scale @xmath141 ( questions related to the existence of @xmath142 are discussed below ) .",

    "using the single- and multi - scale rg functions , the physical couplings @xmath150 and @xmath151 are sufficient to determine the scale @xmath142 by noticing that at the intersection point of the symmetric and physical trajectories , the physical couplings satisfy the constraint @xmath152 .",
    "the symmetric rg trajectories governed by eqs .   and are also uniquely determined after we obtain @xmath142 .",
    "we can thus evolve @xmath108 along the symmetric trajectory to @xmath153 until it reaches the value @xmath154 , and the correct value of the physical coupling @xmath155 therefore self - consistently leads to the numerical value @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the physical couplings of the original theory are now determined .",
    "a similar procedure is used to obtain the physical mass spectrum .",
    "the physical - trajectory values of the mass matrix @xmath156 ( from which the mass eigenvalues @xmath146 , @xmath147 are obtained ) must be evolved using the rg equation to the scale @xmath142 where the mass matrix becomes diagonal with a single mass scale as required to connect with the @xmath1-symmetric trajectory .",
    "rg evolution of the ( diagonal ) mass matrix then continues along the symmetric trajectory to @xmath153 until it reaches the value @xmath135 . just as for the couplings ,",
