    "neutrino oscillation measurements  @xcite have established evidence for tiny neutrino masses , which are supposed to be zero in the standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "it seems mysterious that the scale of neutrino masses is much smaller than that of the other fermion masses .",
    "the simplest way to obtain tiny neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite where right - handed neutrinos are introduced . due to suppression with huge majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos",
    "as compared to the electroweak scale , neutrino masses can be very small even though dirac yukawa coupling constants for neutrinos are of @xmath7 .",
    "however testability of the mechanism seems to be a problem because key particles ( right - handed neutrinos ) with such huge masses would not be accessible in future experiments .",
    "a possible solution for the problem is radiative generation of dirac yukawa couplings for neutrinos . in order to explain tiny neutrino masses , the right - handed neutrinos with masses of @xmath8 are acceptable naturally without assuming excessive fine tuning among coupling constants by virtue of loop - suppressed dirac yukawa couplings .",
    "radiative generation of dirac yukawa couplings has been discussed in various frameworks such as the left - right symmetry  @xcite , supersymmetry  ( susy )  @xcite , extended models within the sm gauge group  @xcite , and an extra @xmath2 gauge symmetry  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    ".    on the other hand , existence of dark matter has been indicated by zwicky  @xcite , and its thermal relic abundance has been quantitatively determined by the wmap experiment  @xcite .",
    "if the essence of the dark matter is an elementary particle , the weakly interacting massive particle  ( wimp ) would be a promising candidate .",
    "a naive power counting shows that the wimp dark matter mass should be at the electroweak scale .",
    "this would suggest a strong connection between the wimp dark matter and the higgs sector .",
    "it is desired to have viable candidate for dark matter in models beyond the standard model .",
    "usually stability of the dark matter candidate is ensured by imposing a @xmath1 parity where the dark matter is the lightest @xmath1-odd particle .",
    "it is well known that such @xmath1 odd particles are compatible with radiative neutrino mass models  @xcite .",
    "usually in such models , however , the origin of the @xmath1 parity has not been clearly discussed .",
    "it seems better if a global symmetry to stabilize the dark matter is not just imposed additionally but obtained as a remnant of some broken symmetry which is used also for other purposes  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new model in which tiny neutrino masses and the origin of dark matter are naturally explained at the tev - scale .",
    "we introduce the @xmath0 gauge symmetry to the sm gauge group which is spontaneously broken at multi - tev scale  @xcite .",
    "its collider phenomenology has been studied  @xcite . in our model ,",
    "dirac yukawa couplings for neutrinos are forbidden at the tree level by the @xmath0 .",
    "they are generated at the one - loop level after the @xmath0 breaking .",
    "simultaneously , right - handed neutrino masses are generated at the tree level by spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "light neutrino masses are obtained effectively at the two - loop level without requiring too small coupling constants ( @xmath9 ) from the tev - scale physics .",
    "furthermore it turns out that the dark matter in our model is stabilized by an unbroken global @xmath2 symmetry which appears automatically in the lagrangian with appropriate assignments of the @xmath0-charges for new particles .",
    "the mass of a dark matter candidate @xmath3 , which is a dirac fermion , is also generated by the @xmath0 breaking   ( see also ref .",
    "we show that the model is viable under the current experimental constraints .",

    ", the experimental constraints from neutrino experiments and the @xmath270 results can be satisfied by using smaller values of @xmath271 and @xmath272 which keep @xmath64 and @xmath68 unchanged from values in our sets  a and b. in the scenario of set  a , a smaller value of @xmath148 results in a larger value of the dm abundance which is proportional to @xmath273 . even if the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmap](a ) goes up by about a factor of 10 , the wmap result can still be explained by @xmath274 .",
    "therefore , we can accept three times larger @xmath53 ( namely , three times smaller @xmath148 ) than the value  ( @xmath275 ) we used .",
    "a shortage is about the gauge anomaly for @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 is free from anomaly if three singlet fermions of @xmath276 ( usual right - handed neutrinos ) are added to the sm .",
    "however , we have introduced not three but only two @xmath14 , and their @xmath5 is not @xmath277 but @xmath278 .",
    "there are also extra @xmath0-charged fermions ( @xmath26 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 gauge symmetry has anomalies for the triangle diagrams of @xmath279 ^ 3 $ ] and @xmath279\\times [ \\text{gravity}]^2 $ ] .",
    "they would be resolved by some heavy singlet fermions with appropriate @xmath5  ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another is the way to reproduce the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "since we have used only particles below the tev - scale , leptogenesis  @xcite does not work in a natural way .",
    "heavy fermions to eliminate the @xmath0 gauge anomaly might help .",
    "the electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite would be accommodated by the introduction of an additional higgs doublet to the model so that new source of cp - violation appears in the higgs potential .",
    "we have presented the tev - scale seesaw model in which @xmath0 gauge symmetry can be the common origin of neutrino masses , the dark matter mass ( if @xmath3 is the one ) , and stability of the dark matter .",
    "light neutrino masses are generated by the two - loop diagrams which are also contributed by the dark matter , a dirac fermion @xmath3 or a complex scalar @xmath4 .",
    "the symmetry to stabilize the dark matter appears in the @xmath0-symmetric lagrangian without introducing additional global symmetry ( ex .  a @xmath1 symmetry ) .",
    "it has been shown that this model can be compatible with constraints from the neutrino oscillation data , the search for @xmath137 , the relic abundance of the dark matter , and the direct search results for dark matter .",
    "it should be emphasized that these constraints are satisfied with sizable coupling constants ( @xmath280 ) and new particles ( including @xmath33 ) whose masses are at or below the tev - scale .",
    "we have discussed collider phenomenology in this model by using two sets of parameters which satisfy constraints from the current experimental data .",
    "the @xmath0 gauge boson @xmath6 can be discovered at the lhc by observing @xmath236 if it is not too heavy . in our model , since the dark matter has @xmath0 charge , @xmath6 partially decays into a pair of the dark matter . as a result , more than @xmath232 of produced @xmath6 is invisible for both the sets .",
    "then a lighter @xmath6 is allowed than the usual experimental bound .",
    "detailed studies for such a @xmath6 would be performed at future linear colliders .",
    "since masses of @xmath14 and @xmath67 are obtained by the @xmath0 breaking , it would be natural that @xmath3 is light and becomes the dark matter when we assume @xmath33 masses are of @xmath8 .",
    "in this case , a large mixing between @xmath78 and @xmath79 is required for the appropriate relic abundance because the yukawa coupling constant is small .",
    "decay branching ratios of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are almost the same as the one for the sm higgs boson .",
    "therefore two sm - like higgs bosons with similar masses ( ex .",
    "@xmath259 and @xmath260 for set  a ) would be discovered at the lhc .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath4 is the dark matter , the decay of the lighter higgs boson @xmath78 can be dominated by invisible @xmath261 . for set",
    "b , we obtain @xmath281",
    ". then this model would be tested at future linear colliders by measuring the amount of the invisible decay .",
