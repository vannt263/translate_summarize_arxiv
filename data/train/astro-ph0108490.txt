    "m31 , the andromeda nebula , is the nearest ( @xmath8 kpc ) spiral galaxy , forming the local group of galaxies together with our milky way and others .",
    "its close distance enables us to perform very detailed observations in the x - ray band .",
    "because the direction to m31 is clear of strong absorption along the galactic plane , it potentially allows more comprehensive x - ray spectroscopic studies of x - ray sources over a wider energy range than is possible for those in our own galaxy .",
    "consequently , many x - ray observations of m31 were so far performed .",
    "the soft x - ray maps of m31 obtained by einstein and rosat respectively revealed over 100 sources with the 0.24.0 kev luminosity exceeding @xmath9 erg s@xmath6 ( @xcite ) , and more than 300 sources with the 0.12.4 kev luminosity exceeding @xmath10 erg s@xmath6 ( @xcite ) . in the hard 220 kev energy band",
    ", the integrated spectrum of the galaxy obtained with ginga has been understood as emission from a collection of x - ray binaries , with the integrated luminosity reaching @xmath11 erg s@xmath6 ( makishima et al .",
    "1989b ; hereafter ) .",
    "the einstein and rosat observations also revealed unresolved and apparently extended x - ray emission from the bulge of m31 .",
    "this is thought to be emission from a diffuse hot plasma , or from a collection of faint discrete sources below the detection limit ( @xciteb ; @xcite ) .",
    "using the bepposax spectra , @xcite reconfirmed that the hard - band ( @xmath12 kev ) emission from m31 can be described by a collection of binary sources , while an additional spectral component is required in the soft band . however , due to the limited energy resolution in the soft band , the properties of the additional soft emission remains poorly understood .",
    "a further confusion as to the nature of the soft component is caused by uncertainties in the way of modeling the x - ray binary spectra below @xmath13 kev ( e.g. , @xciteb ; @xcite ) , which persist even in the latest studies with chandra and xmm - newton ( @xciteb ; @xcite ) .    to study this unresolved emission ,",
    "we analyzed the integrated 0.610 kev spectra of the central ( up to 2.4 kpc ) regions of m31 taken with the gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ; @xcite ) and the sis ( solid - state imaging spectrometer ; @xcite ) , both onboard asca ( @xcite ) . by employing a physical modeling of the x - ray binary spectra established through observations of galactic x - ray sources ( @xcitea ; @xcite )",
    ", we have discovered that the unresolved soft emission involves two plasma temperatures , @xmath3 kev and @xmath4 kev .",
    "therefore , the unresolved emission is likely to consist of two distinct components .",
    "the asca observations of m31 were performed from 28 to 31 july 1993 in the performance verification phase for @xmath14 ks in total .",
    "the observations were divided into six partially - overlapping pointings covering a large fraction of the optical galaxy disk , including the central region in particular . during all these observations ,",
    "the gis was operated in normal pulse - height mode , and the sis was in 4ccd mode . in figure",
    "[ fig : m31_image ] , we show the mosaic gis images from all the six pointings .",
    "thus , the central region of m31 is too crowded to be resolved by asca . in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore analyze the data from this central - pointing field as a collection of many discrete sources and possibly diffuse emission , in an attempt to separate different x - ray components spectrally rather than spatially .    for the central pointing data , we screened the events under the condition of a telescope viewing direction of @xmath15 from the dark earth rim , and a magnetic cutoff rigidity @xmath16 gv and @xmath17 gv for the gis and the sis , respectively . for the sis data",
    ", we further required the time after day - night transition to be @xmath18 s , and the elevation angle from the sunlit earth rim to be @xmath19 in order to avoid the effect of light leakage on the ccd chips .",
    "we also removed particle events by the standard rise - time rejection for the gis , and similarly removed hot or flickering pixels for the sis . after applying these criteria , we obtained net exposures of @xmath20 ks with the gis ( gis2+gis3 ) and @xmath21 ks with the sis ( sis0+sis1 ) .",
    "the 0.710 kev count rates were @xmath3 c s@xmath6 and @xmath22 c s@xmath6 , for the gis and sis , respectively .",
    "after the data screening described in section 2 , we constructed the gis and sis energy spectra for the central region of m31 .",
    "the events were extracted from a circular region centered on the nucleus , using a radius of @xmath2 ( 2.4 kpc ) , the largest possible radius without being affected by dominant point sources which should be analyzed individually . as to the sis ,",
    "the field of view ( @xmath23 in 4ccd mode ) is a little smaller than the @xmath2 radius , and we use only the region on the detector .",
    "we derived background data from blank - sky observations , for which we applied the same data - selection criteria as in section 2 , and used the same photon - accumulation region .",
    "after the background subtractions and appropriate gain corrections , we added the data from gis2 and gis3 into a single gis spectrum , and those from sis0 and sis1 into a single sis spectrum .",
    "the obtained spectra are shown in figure  [ fig:1.5_10kev ] without removing the instrumental responses .",
    "the signal x - rays are thus detected over the 0.710 kev range with the gis , and over the 0.67.5 kev range with the sis .    in order to roughly investigate the spatial distribution of x - ray sources",
    ", we also accumulated two more pairs of spectra over smaller circular regions centered on the nucleus , using radii of @xmath0 ( 0.6 kpc ) and @xmath1 ( 1.2 kpc ) .",
    "the former radius is twice as large as the half - power radius of asca .",
    "below , we analyze the @xmath2 spectra in subsections 3.2 through 3.4 , and apply the results to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ones in subsection 3.5 .      the x - ray emission from m31 is thought to be dominated by a collection of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs , accreting binaries involving neutron stars with weak magnetic fields ) at least in energy bands above @xmath13 kev (;",
    "indeed , when the absorption was fixed to the galactic value along the line of sight toward m31 , @xmath24 @xmath25 ( from einline and w3nh ) , the 220 kev spectrum of the whole m31 obtained with ginga has been described successfully ( ) by the physical model developed for galactic high - luminosity lmxbs ; it consists of a disk black - body ( dbb ) component and a black - body ( bb ) component , which represent emission from the optically - thick accretion disk and the central neutron star , respectively ( @xcitea ; @xcite ) .",
    "we hereafter refer to this model as the lmxb model ( see appendix for detail ) .",
    "in contrast , the ginga spectrum was not reproduced by thermal bremsstrahlung or power - law models , unless a significant amount of excess absorption was incorporated .",
    "since the absorption within m31 itself is rather small , the excess absorption is considered artificial , making these two alternative spectral models unrealistic .",
    "we accordingly fitted the 1.510 kev gis and sis spectra of the central @xmath2 radius simultaneously with the lmxb model . here and hereafter",
    ", we fix the value of the absorption column density at the galactic value . as summarized in table  [",
    "tab : lmxb ] , the lmxb model has simultaneously reproduced the gis / sis spectra very well in the energy range above 1.5 kev , and the obtained parameters are consistent with those obtained previously with ginga ( ) .",
    "furthermore , the inner - disk temperature of @xmath26 kev , the bb temperature of @xmath27 kev , and the cross - over of the two components at 3.3 kev ( figure  [ fig:1.5_10kev ] ) , are all typical of luminous galactic and magellanic lmxbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore reconfirmed that a collection of lmxbs dominates the x - ray emission from m31 above @xmath13 kev . in subsection 3.6",
    ", we examine what happens if our lmxb model is replaced with more conventional ones , such as a single thermal bremsstrahlung or a single power - law model , even though these alternative modelings have already been ruled out by ginga ( ) .      when the best - fit lmxb model determined in the 1.510 kev band is extrapolated toward lower energies , the model prediction falls significantly short of the actual data ( figure  [ fig:1.5_10kev ] ) ; the fit actually becomes unacceptable by including the 0.81.5 kev band , even re - adjusting the model parameters except @xmath28 ( table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) .",
    "this reconfirms the previous reports on the soft x - ray excess ( @xciteb ; @xcite ) .",
    "the soft excess is consistently seen between the two asca instruments , although it is more significant in the sis data because of its improved low - energy efficiency .",
    "we suspect the soft excess , prominent below energies of @xmath29 kev in figure  [ fig:1.5_10kev ] , to be contributed significantly by low - energy atomic lines emergent from thin - thermal plasmas .",
    "we accordingly examined the 0.83.5 kev portion of the gis / sis spectra more closely for the existence of atomic emission lines from major elements .",
    "we approximated the overall gis / sis continua ( including the soft excess ) conventionally by a single bremsstrahlung model , to find a rather poor fit with @xmath30/d.o.f .",
    "= 351/227 as shown in figure [ fig : line]a . by including 5 gaussians , in contrast ,",
    "the fit has been significantly improved ( @xmath30/d.o.f .",
    "= 211/217 ; figure",
    "[ fig : line]b ) .",
    "the five gaussians are centered at @xmath31 kev , @xmath32 kev , @xmath33 kev , @xmath34 kev , and @xmath35 kev , with equivalent widths of @xmath36 ev , @xmath37 ev , @xmath38 ev , @xmath39 ev , and @xmath40 ev , respectively .",
    "thus , the lines are statistically significant . based on the central energies ,",
    "the former three lines may be assigned to either ionized ne - k or ionized fe - l lines , while the latter two to ionized si - k and s - k lines , respectively .",
    "we can hence conclude that the spectra exhibit statistically significant evidence of low - energy emission lines from ionized abundant heavy elements .",
    "now that the thin - thermal nature of the soft excess has been confirmed , we are justified to express the soft excess by a thin - thermal plasma emission model .",
    "specifically , we employ the raymond - smith emission model ( raymond & smith 1977 ; hereafter rs model ) , and tentatively fix its metal abundance at 1.0 solar , as has been found from the galactic ridge emission ( @xcite ) and an apparently diffuse x - ray emission filling the galactic bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "we hence fitted the gis / sis spectra over the 0.810 kev energy band by the sum of the lmxb and rs components .",
    "this two - component model , denoted lmxb+rs model , has successfully explained the 0.810 kev gis / sis spectra , with the plasma temperature being @xmath41 kev ( table [ tab : lmxb ] ) . in other words , the soft excess seen in figure [ fig:1.5_10kev ] below 1.5 kev has been explained successfully as emission from a 0.8 kev thin - thermal plasma .      as in subsection 3.3 , we extended the lmxb+rs model , determined over the 0.810 kev energy band , further into the 0.610 kev energy band .",
    "then , as shown in figure  [ fig:0.8_10kev ] , the model has again left a large excess below @xmath41 kev . as a result ,",
    "the lmxb+rs fit that was acceptable in the 0.810 kev range becomes unacceptable in the 0.610 kev range , even re - adjusting the model parameters except @xmath28 and abundances ( table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) .",
    "this indicates the presence of a third , and the softest , emission component that dominates the spectra below @xmath41 kev .",
    "the softest component may be contributed by o - k lines appearing in the 0.60.7 kev range .",
    "we therefore added one more rs component to jointly fit the total - band ( 0.610 kev ) gis / sis spectra .",
    "this model , denoted lmxb+2rs model , has indeed decreased @xmath30 down to an acceptable level , as shown in figure  [ fig:0.6_10kev ] and table  [ tab : lmxb ] .",
    "the obtained two plasma temperatures are @xmath3 kev and @xmath4 kev , and their luminosities are given in table  [ tab : luminosity ] ; here and hereafter , we quote luminosities in the 0.510 kev energy band . even if the metal abundances of the two rs components are allowed to vary freely , the fit result does not change significantly , and neither of the two rs components vanishes . if , for simplicity , we constrain the two rs components to have common abundances with solar ratios , the 90% confidence range of the metal abundance becomes @xmath42 solar . when the mekal model ( @xcite , 1986 ; @xcite ) is used instead of the rs model ,",
    "the spectra also require two thin - thermal components besides the lmxb component , and the obtained parameters are consistent , at the 90% confidence level , with those derived by using the rs model .      in order to examine the reality and the nature of the three spectroscopic components found above ,",
    "it would help to study their spatial distributions utilizing the imaging capability of asca .",
    "accordingly , we have accumulated the gis and sis events over two concentric circular regions of smaller radii of @xmath0 ( 0.6 kpc ) and @xmath1 ( 1.2 kpc ) , centered on the nucleus , as performed in subsection 3.1 for the @xmath2 region .",
    "we again subtracted the blank - sky background spectra .",
    "as presented in figure  [ fig:3+6 ] , the gis / sis spectra accumulated over these regions are similar in shape to those derived from the @xmath2 region ( figure  [ fig:0.6_10kev ] ) , and have actually been reproduced successfully by the lmxb+2rs model .",
    "the derived parameters , summarized in table  [ tab:3+6 ] , are close to those found in the @xmath2 accumulation region ( table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : luminosity ] , we show the spatially - dependent luminosities of the three spectral components constituting the lmxb+2rs model .",
    "thus , the three components are statistically significant in every pair of spectra .",
    "all the three components are clearly extended , but are more concentrated toward the nucleus than is expected for a uniform distribution . while the luminosities of the lmxb component and the softest ( 0.3 kev rs ) component are consistent with having the same spatial distribution , there is a marginal evidence that the hotter ( 0.9 kev rs ) component is less extended around the nucleus .",
    "all these results reinforce the reality of the three spectral components .",
    "although we have thus successfully decomposed the spatially - integrated m31 spectra , the lmxb model employed to represent the x - ray binary contribution had been developed for the most luminous lmxbs with luminosity exceeding @xmath43 erg s@xmath6 ( @xcitea ; @xcite ) , residing in our galaxy and the large magellanic cloud ( specifically , lmc  x-2 ) .",
    "less luminous lmxbs tend to show more power - law like spectra due to comptonization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a claim , though without physical grounds , that lmxbs might exhibit a prominent soft excess component of which the strength is correlated with environmental metallicity ( @xciteab ) . with these in mind ,",
    "we re - fitted the 0.610 kev gis / sis spectra for the @xmath2 region , but this time by replacing the lmxb model with a single thermal bremsstrahlung ( bremss for short ) model or a single power - law ( pl for short ) model . in logarithmic plots ,",
    "the bremss model is more convex than the pl model , but less convex than the lmxb model ( see appendix for detail ) .",
    "we again fix the absorption to the galactic value .    as summarized in table  [",
    "tab : bremss+power ] , the single bremss model could not reproduce the 0.610 kev gis / sis spectra due to the soft excess . adding an rs component ( again with the abundance fixed at 1.0 solar ) improved the fit significantly , and further adding a second rs component has made the fit acceptable ; the obtained bremss+2rs fit is shown in figure  [ fig : bremss+power]a .",
    "these results , together with the obtained rs parameters , are basically similar to those we obtained using the lmxb model in table  [ tab : lmxb ] .",
    "this is understandable , because the bremss model of the temperature @xmath44 kev is similar in shape to the lmxb model over the asca band , except that the former predicts a slightly higher flux below @xmath13 kev .",
    "however , the lmxb+2rs model reproduces the overall data better than the bremss+2rs model ( with @xmath30/d.o.f .",
    "= 300/309 vs.  307/311 ) , and the difference is significant at a @xmath45% confidence level according to an @xmath46-test .",
    "these results are consistent with the conclusion of that the 220 kev spectrum of m31 is represented significantly better by the lmxb model than the bremss model .    as to the pl modeling , the fit remained unacceptable even adding up to two rs components ( table  [ tab : bremss+power ] ) .",
    "the unsuccessful pl+2rs fit is shown in figure  [ fig : bremss+power]b , where both instruments consistently reveal a negative residual feature near 1.2 kev .",
    "this is because the pl model overpredicts the continuum at this energy . in short ,",
    "the pl model is inappropriate as a representation of the x - ray binary spectrum in m31 , as already revealed in .",
    "using the asca data , we have confirmed that the spatially integrated 0.610 kev x - ray emission from the central regions of m31 comprises three spectral components ; the integrated x - ray binary component , and the 0.9 kev ( hotter ) and the 0.3 kev ( cooler ) rs components .",
    "all the three components are spatially extended , in agreement with the repeated detections of unresolved , possibly diffuse , soft x - ray emission ( @xciteb ; @xcite ) .",
    "below , we compare our results with those from other missions , and discuss the nature of the three components .",
    "the integrated binary component dominates the spectrum above @xmath13 kev , as already known previously ( e.g. , ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have successfully modeled this emission using our physical lmxb model , consisting of a dbb component and a bb component .",
    "this result agrees with the main achievement of , that the 220 kev ginga spectrum of the whole m31 is described successfully using the same model .",
    "our parameters for the lmxb component are consistent with those derived in . furthermore , when integrated up to @xmath2 , the 0.510 kev luminosity of this component measured with asca ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ; table  [ tab : luminosity ] ) compares reasonably with the 220 kev luminosity of the whole m31 derived with ginga , @xmath47 erg s@xmath6 ( ) .",
    "we are of course aware that our lmxb model , which has primarily been developed for very luminous ones , may not necessarily be appropriate for fainter sources which must contribute to the spatially integrated asca spectra .",
    "the spectra of such fainter lmxbs , with luminosities below @xmath48 erg s@xmath6 , may be described better by a pl model with a mild high - energy turn over ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the luminosity function of discrete x - ray sources in m31 obtained with rosat ( @xcite ) indicates that the integrated x - ray luminosity of m31 is predominantly contributed by sources more luminous than @xmath48 erg s@xmath6 , with the fainter ones contributing only 10% or less .",
    "furthermore , m31 does not host apparent examples of enigmatic `` ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources '' ( ulxs ; @xcite ) that shine extremely beyond the eddington limit for a neutron star .",
    "consequently , the largest contribution to the total x - ray emission is thought to come from lmxbs , justifying the use of our lmxb spectral model .",
    "in contrast to our approach , other investigators mostly model the binary component in more conventional ways , in terms of either the bremss or the pl model ( @xciteb ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bremss modeling may be consistent with our asca data , but evidently this has no physical grounds .",
    "furthermore , the bremss model has been rejected by the 220 kev ginga spectrum of the whole m31 ( ) , presumably because this energy band is more suited than the asca band to characterize the overall spectral shape of luminous point x - ray sources .",
    "the pl modeling has been revealed to be inconsistent with the high - quality asca data . we thus conclude that our lmxb model gives the most appropriate account of the integrated binary emission from m31 .    to confirm the above idea , we simulated the xmm - newton epic spectrum for bright point sources in m31 ( blue one in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite ) , employing the best - fit pl model of photon index 1.82 and absorption @xmath49 @xmath25 as reported by @xcite , and using a publicly available epic response ( mos1_medium_all_qe17_rmf3_tel5_15.rsp ) . when fitted with our lmxb model over the 0.67.0 kev range",
    ", the simulated spectrum exhibits a weak soft excess below @xmath41 kev , yielding @xmath50/d.o.f .",
    "= 446/226 .",
    "this meets our expectation , since the spectrum must inevitably contain a small amount of background / foreground diffuse emission , even though it was accumulated over small radii ( @xmath51 ; @xcite ) around bright point sources .",
    "the soft excess thus revealed is modeled reasonably well ( @xmath50/d.o.f .  = 288/262 ) by two rs components of one solar abundances , with temperatures of @xmath52 kev and @xmath53 kev .",
    "when normalized to the binary component , the inferred luminosities of the two rs components are @xmath54% of those found from the asca spectra .",
    "this is reasonable , because the data integration area used to generate the epic point - source spectrum is estimated to have a filling factor of 1040% , as judging from @xcite .",
    "the second component , the @xmath3 kev thin - thermal plasma emission , is a new component which has not been detected so far by other missions .",
    "for example , the chandra and xmm - newton observations clearly revealed the presence of apparently diffuse x - ray emission in the central region of m31 ( @xciteb ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite decomposed the spectrum of this unresolved emission obtained by xmm - newton into a soft thin - thermal plasma component of a temperature @xmath55 kev , and a hard residual emission from fainter discrete sources .",
    "however , they did not find the 0.9 kev thin - thermal plasma which we have discovered .",
    "this discrepancy , we believe , is again due to the difference in the way of modeling the residual binary component contributing to the unresolved emission .",
    "@xcite modeled the residual component in terms of the pl model , which as well as the bremss is steeper in the soft x - ray range than our lmxb model ( appendix ) . as a result , the 0.9 kev component in the diffuse emission was presumably taken up by the model describing the binary contribution .",
    "actually , when we replace the lmxb model by the bremss model in the asca spectral fit , the normalization ( and hence luminosity ) of the 0.9 kev component decreases to @xmath56% of its original value , although it does not vanish .",
    "furthermore , when the binary contribution to the asca spectra is represented by a pl model , the normalization of the 0.9 kev component reduces to @xmath57% of that found with the lmxb modeling ( the fit becoming unacceptable ; subsection  3.6 , figure  7b , table  4 ) . by chandra with its excellent imaging capability ,",
    "the same region was resolved into more point sources than those by xmm - newton , and the contribution of them to the unresolved emission can be further reduced .",
    "however , there have not yet been any detailed spectral analyses but for a hardness ratio one which confirmed the value is consistent with that expected from a @xmath4 kev rs component ( @xciteb ) .",
    "we can independently strengthen the reality of the 0.9 kev component , by considering atomic emission lines .",
    "as described in subsection 3.3 , the asca spectra bears a statistically significant ionized s - k line ; so does the diffuse - component spectrum obtained with the xmm - newton epic ( red one in fig .  7 of @xcite ) .",
    "since the s - k lines can not be emitted significantly by plasmas of temperatures as low as 0.30.4 kev , the data require a considerably higher plasma temperature .",
    "furthermore , a close look at the same xmm - newton epic spectrum for the diffuse emission reveals mg - k ( at 1.50 kev ) and si - k ( at 2.04 kev ) lines of hydrogen - like species .",
    "such an ionization state also require a plasma temperature of @xmath29 kev .",
    "the 0.9 kev component in m31 reminds us of the fact that two large - scale diffuse galactic x - ray emission phenomena , namely the galactic ridge emission ( @xcite ) and the galactic bulge emission ( @xcite ) , both involve a soft component expressed by thin - thermal plasma emission of a temperature 0.60.8 kev .",
    "these soft components in the galactic ridge and bulge emission , integrated over the whole galaxy , exhibit a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath58 erg s@xmath6 and @xmath59 erg s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "considering our limited data integration region around the m31 nucleus and the measured luminosity , the 0.9 kev rs component of m31 may be similar to the soft component of the galactic diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "although the origin of these galactic soft components is still unsettled , an assembly of old supernova remnants may be a possibility ( @xcite ) .",
    "if so , the 0.9 kev rs component in m31 may be related to the past supernova activity in m31 .",
    "the softest spectral component that appears in the energy range below @xmath41 kev has been modeled by a thin - thermal emission with a temperature @xmath4 kev , even though there may be a room for alternative modelings .",
    "although the nucleus of m31 emits very soft x - rays , its 0.37 kev luminosity , @xmath60 erg s@xmath6 ( @xcitea ) , falls by an order of magnitude below that of our softest component .",
    "furthermore , our softest component is clearly extended ( subsection 3.5 ) .",
    "therefore , contribution from the m31 nucleus is considered negligible .",
    "we tentatively consider the softest component as coming from an optically - thin plasma of a temperature @xmath4 kev .",
    "this agrees with the chandra and xmm - newton results on m31 , and on ngc  4697 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one obvious candidate for this cooler rs component is warm inter - stellar medium , as has been confirmed in some external galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another promising candidate is an assembly of stellar coronae .",
    "a solar - type star has a typical coronal temperature of @xmath4 kev , and an x - ray luminosity 57 orders of magnitude lower than its bolometric luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated bolometric luminosity of m31 is @xmath61 erg s@xmath6 ( @xcite ) , and that from the central @xmath2 region is estimated to be @xmath62 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "the measured luminosity of the 0.3 kev rs component ( table  [ tab : luminosity ] ) thus becomes @xmath63 when normalized to the stellar bolometric luminosity therein .",
    "since this value is close to those found for individual coronal sources , the cooler rs component may be contributed significantly by the stellar coronae , as well as by warm inter - stellar medium .",
    "the x - ray spectra of luminous ( @xmath64 erg s@xmath6 ) lmxbs are described successfully with the two - component physical model by @xcite , consisting of a softer and a harder components .",
    "the softer one is a dbb model , which represents the integrated emission from an optically - thick accretion disk around the nonmagnetized neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the harder one is a @xmath65 kev bb model , which represents the emission from the central neutron - star surface where the kinetic energy of the accreting matter is thermalized .",
    "the x - ray spectra of lmxbs are hence described by four parameters ; the innermost disk temperature @xmath66 and the normalization of the dbb component , and the temperature @xmath67 and the normalization of the bb component .",
    "luminous galactic lmxbs exhibit rather narrow scatter both in @xmath68 and @xmath69 , typically @xmath70 kev and @xmath71 kev .",
    "the two constituent components usually cross over at energies of 37 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model has been verified against the lmxb spectra taken with various satellites , including tenma ( @xcite ) , ginga ( @xcitea ) , and asca ( @xcite ) .    as a specific example",
    ", we fitted the spectrum of 4u @xmath72 taken with the asca gis in october 1993 .",
    "this is a typical galactic lmxb located in the globular cluster ngc  6624 , and exhibits a relatively low line - of - sight absorption .",
    "it was hence used in as a comparison source . since",
    "the source is too bright for the sis , we use the gis data only .",
    "we screened the gis ( gis2 and gis3 ) events as in section 2 , to archive a net exposure of @xmath73 ks .",
    "the 0.710 kev count rate was @xmath74 c s@xmath6 per gis detector , corresponding to @xmath14 mcrab which is typical of 4u @xmath72 .",
    "the spectrum has such a high statistics that the calibration uncertainty becomes the dominant source of errors in the model fitting .",

    "we fitted the 0.710 kev gis spectrum of this lmxb with our lmxb model , as well as the two conventional models , a single bremss or a single pl model .",
    "we left the absorption column density free .",
    "the lmxb model has reproduced the spectrum very well , in spite of the very high signal statistics ( figure  [ fig:4u1820]a , table  [ tab:4u1820 ] ) . on the contrary",
    ", the other two models showed poorer results ( figure  [ fig:4u1820]b and c , table  [ tab:4u1820 ] ) .",
    "the bremss fit , marginally acceptable , yielded @xmath75 @xmath25 and @xmath44 kev .",
    "these values are typical when an lmxb spectrum is approximated by a bremss model ( @xcitea ) . in this case",
    ", the absorption is thought to be artificial , required by the slope of the bremss continuum ( @xmath76 in the energy range @xmath77 ) which is steeper than that of the dbb model ( @xmath78 for @xmath79 ) .",
    "the temperature obtained through the bremss fit to the m31 spectrum is close to those for 4u 1820@xmath8030 .",
    "although the lmxb fit is acceptable , the derived @xmath28 is lower than the galactic value of @xmath81 @xmath25 ( from einline and w3nh ) .",
    "this is probably due to a very weak `` soft excess '' component , emitted by 4u  @xmath72 itself or environment . actually , adding an rs model of a temperature @xmath3 kev has made the lmxb fit even better , and this model is acceptable even when the absorption is fixed at the galactic value ( table  [ tab:4u1820 ] ) .",
    "the obtained flux in the 0.510 kev energy band of this soft component ( @xmath82 erg @xmath25 s@xmath6 ) is only @xmath65% of that of the lmxb component ( @xmath83 erg @xmath25 s@xmath6 ) .",
