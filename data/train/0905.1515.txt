    "the successful bose - einstein condensation of @xmath0cr atoms @xcite realizes for the first time bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with significant dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these long - range and anisotropic interactions introduce rich physical effects , as well as new opportunities to control becs .",
    "a basic example is how dipole - dipole interactions modify the shape of a trapped bec . in a prolate ( elongated )",
    "dipolar gas with the dipoles polarised along the long axis the net dipolar interaction is attractive , whereas for an oblate ( flattened ) configuration with the dipoles aligned along the short axis the net dipolar interaction is repulsive . as a result , in comparison to _ s_-wave becs ( which we define as systems in which atom - atom scattering is dominated by the _ s_-wave channel ) , a dipolar bec elongates along the direction of an applied polarizing field @xcite .",
    "a full theoretical treatment of a trapped bec involves solving the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the condensate wave function .",
    "the non - local nature of the mean - field potential describing dipole - dipole interactions means that this task is significantly harder for dipolar becs than for _ s_-wave ones .",
    "however , in the limit where the bec contains a large number of atoms the problem of finding the ground state density profile and low - energy dynamics simplifies . in a harmonic trap with oscillator length @xmath1 , a bec containing @xmath2 atoms of mass @xmath3 which have repulsive _ s_-wave interactions characterized by scattering length @xmath4 enters the thomas - fermi ( tf ) regime for large values of the parameter @xmath5 . in the tf regime",
    "the zero - point kinetic energy can be ignored in comparison to the interaction and trapping energies and the gross - pitaevskii equation reduces to the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics at @xmath6 .",
    "when applied to a trapped @xmath7-wave bec these equations are known to admit a large class of exact analytic solutions @xcite .",
    "the tf approximation can also be applied to dipolar becs @xcite .",
    "although the resulting superfluid hydrodynamic equations for a dipolar bec contain the non - local dipolar potential , exact solutions can still be found @xcite and we make extensive use of them here .",
    "the calculations in this paper are all made within the tf regime .",
    "condensates are quantum fluids described by a macroscopic wave function @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the condensate density and @xmath10 is the condensate phase .",
    "this constrains the velocity field @xmath11 to be curl - free @xmath12 . in an experiment rotation of the condensate",
    "can be accomplished by applying a rotating elliptical deformation to the trapping potential @xcite . at low rotation frequencies",
    "the elliptical deformation excites low - lying collective modes ( quadrupole etc . ) with quantized angular momentum which may be viewed as surface waves ( and which obey @xmath12 ) . above a certain critical rotation frequency vortices",
    "are seen to enter the condensate and these satisfy the @xmath12 condition by having quantized circulation .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for a bec provide a simple and accurate description of the low - lying collective modes .",
    "furthermore , they predict these modes become unstable for certain ranges of rotation frequency @xcite .",
    "comparison with experiments @xcite and full numerical simulations of the gpe @xcite have clearly shown that the instabilities are the first step in the entry of vortices into the condensate and the formation of a vortex lattice .",
    "crucially , the hydrodynamic equations give a clear explanation of why vortex lattice formation in @xmath7-wave becs was only observed to occur at a much greater rotation frequency than that at which they become energetically favorable .",
    "it is only at these higher frequencies that the vortex - free condensate becomes dynamically unstable .",
    "individual vortices @xcite and vortex lattices @xcite in dipolar condensates have already been studied theoretically . however , a key question that remains is how to make such states in the first place . in this paper",
    "we extend the tf approximation for rotating trapped condensates to include dipolar interactions , building on our previous work @xcite . specifically , starting from the hydrodynamic equations of motion we obtain the stationary solutions for a condensate in a rotating elliptical trap and find when they become dynamically unstable to perturbations .",
    "this enables us to predict the regimes of stable and unstable motion of a rotating dipolar condensate . for a non - dipolar bec ( in the tf limit )",
    "the transition between stable and unstable motion is independent of the interaction strength , and depends only on the rotation frequency and trap ellipticity in the plane perpendicular to the rotation vector @xcite .",
    "we show that for a dipolar bec it is additionally dependent on the strength of the dipolar interactions and also the axial trapping strength .",
    "all of these quantities are experimentally tunable and this extends the routes that can be employed to induce instability",
    ". meanwhile , the critical rotation frequency at which vortices become energetically favorable @xmath13 is also sensitive to the trap geometry and dipolar interactions @xcite , and means that the formation of a vortex lattice following the instability can not be assumed . using a simple prediction for this frequency",
    ", we indicate the regimes in which we expect vortex lattice formation to occur . by considering all of the key and experimentally tunable quantities in the system",
    "we outline several accessible routes to generate instability and vortex lattices in dipolar condensates .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the mean - field theory and the tf approximation for dipolar becs , in section iii we derive the hydrodynamic equations for a trapped dipolar bec in the rotating frame , and in section iv we obtain the corresponding stationary states and discuss their behaviour . in section v we show how to obtain the dynamical stability of these states to perturbations , and in section vi we employ the results of the previous sections to discuss possible pathways to induce instability in the motion of the bec and discuss the possibility that such instability leads to the formation of a vortex lattice .",
    "finally in section vii we conclude our findings and suggest directions for future work .",
    "we consider a bec with long - range dipolar atomic interactions , with the dipoles aligned in the @xmath14 direction by an external field .",
    "the condensate wave function ( mean - field order parameter ) for the condensate @xmath15 satisfies the gpe which is given by @xcite , @xmath16\\psi \\label{gpe } , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the atomic mass .",
    "the @xmath17-term arises from kinetic energy and @xmath18 is the external confining potential .",
    "becs typically feature _ s_-wave atomic interactions which gives rise to a local cubic nonlinearity with coefficient @xmath19 , where @xmath4 is the _ s_-wave scattering length .",
    "note that @xmath4 , and therefore @xmath20 , can be experimentally tuned between positive values ( repulsive interactions ) and negative values ( attractive interactions ) by means of a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the dipolar interactions lead to a non - local mean - field potential @xmath21 which is given by @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the condensate density and @xmath24 is the interaction potential of two dipoles separated by a vector @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the angle between @xmath25 and the polarization direction , which we take to be the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the dipolar becs made to date have featured permanent magnetic dipoles .",
    "then , assuming the dipoles to have moment @xmath27 and be aligned in an external magnetic field @xmath28 , the dipolar coupling is @xmath29 @xcite , where @xmath30 is the permeability of free space .",
    "alternatively , for dipoles induced by a static electric field @xmath31 , the coupling constant @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 is the static polarizability and @xmath34 is the permittivity of free space . in both cases , the sign and magnitude of @xmath35 can be tuned through the application of a fast - rotating external field @xcite .",
    "we will specify the interaction strengths through the parameter @xmath36 which is the ratio of the dipolar interactions to the s - wave interactions @xcite .",
    "we take the _ s_-wave interactions to be repulsive , @xmath37 , and so where we discuss negative values of @xmath38 , this corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "we will also limit our analysis to the regime of @xmath40 , where the thomas - fermi approach predicts that non - rotating stationary solutions are robustly stable @xcite . outside of this regime",
    "the situation becomes more complicated since the non - rotating system becomes prone to collapse @xcite .",
    "we are concerned with a bec confined by an elliptical harmonic trapping potential of the form , @xmath41.\\ ] ] in the @xmath42 plane the trap has mean trap frequency @xmath43 and ellipticity @xmath44 . the trap strength in the axial direction , and indeed the geometry of the trap itself , is specified by the trap ratio @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath46 the bec shape will typically be oblate ( flattened ) while for @xmath47 it will typically be prolate ( elongated ) , although for strong enough dipolar interactions the electrostrictive / magnetostrictive effect can cause a bec in an oblate trap to become prolate itself .    the time - dependent gpe ( [ gpe ] ) can be reduced to its time - independent form by making the substitution @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the chemical potential of the system .",
    "we employ the tf approximation whereby the kinetic energy of static solutions is taken to be negligible in comparison to the potential and interaction energies .",
    "the validity of this approximation in dipolar becs has been discussed elsewhere @xcite . then , the time - independent gpe reduces to , @xmath50 for ease of calculation the dipolar potential @xmath51 can be expressed as , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a fictitious ` electrostatic ' potential defined by @xcite , @xmath54 this effectively reduces the problem of calculating the dipolar potential ( [ dipole_a ] ) to the calculation of an electrostatic potential of the form ( [ potential ] ) , for which a much larger theoretical body of literature exists .",

    "it is observed experimentally , however , that vortex lattice formation occurs at considerably higher frequencies , typically @xmath241 .",
    "this difference arises because above @xmath13 the vortex - free solutions remain remarkably stable .",

    "another way of visualising this is as follows .",
    "above @xmath13 the vortex - free condensate resides in some local energy minimum , while the global minimum represents a vortex or vortex lattice state .",
    "since the vortex is a topological defect , there typically exists a considerable energy barrier for a vortex to enter the system .",
    "however , the hydrodynamic instabilities offer a route to navigate the bec out of the vortex - free local energy minimum towards the vortex lattice state .",
    "( long dashed red curve ) and @xmath199 ( short dashed curve ) , and the critical rotation frequency for vorticity @xmath13 ( solid curve ) for ( a ) an oblate trap @xmath243 and ( b ) a prolate trap @xmath244 .",
    "the instability frequencies are based on a trap with ellipticity @xmath170 while @xmath13 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ crit_freq ] ) under the assumption of a @xmath0cr bec with @xmath245 atoms and scattering length @xmath246 nm in a circularly symmetric trap with @xmath247hz.[fig5],width=283 ]    note that vortex lattice formation occurs via non - trivial dynamics .",
    "the initial hydrodynamic instability in the vortex - free state that we have discussed in this paper is only the first step @xcite .",
    "for example , if the condensate is on the upper branch of hydrodynamic solutions ( e.g. under adiabatic introduction of @xmath99 ) and undergoes a dynamical instability , this leads to the exponential growth of surface ripples in the condensate @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the condensate is on the lower branch and the static solutions disappear ( e.g. following the introduction of @xmath44 ) the condensate undergoes large and dramatic shape oscillations . in both cases",
    "the destabilisation of the vortex - free condensate leads to the nucleation of vortices into the system .",
    "a transient turbulent state of vortices and density perturbations then forms , which subsequently relaxes into a vortex lattice configuration @xcite .    in the presence of dipolar interactions",

    "( [ crit_freq ] ) for the condensate radius .",
    "this method still assumes that the size of the vortex is characterised by the s - wave healing length @xmath249 .",
    "although one does expect the dipolar interactions to modify the size of the vortex core , it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ crit_freq ] ) only has logarithmic accuracy and is relatively insensitive to the choice of vortex core length scale .",
    "the dominant effect of the dipolar interactions in eq .",
    "( [ crit_freq ] ) comes from the radial size and is accounted for .",
    "note also that this expression is for a circularly symmetric system while we are largely concerned with elliptical traps .",
    "however we will employ a very weak ellipticity @xmath170 for which we expect the correction to the critical frequency to be correspondingly small .",
    "as an example , we take the parameter space of rotation frequency @xmath99 and dipolar interactions @xmath38 .",

    "[ fig5](a ) we plot the instability frequencies @xmath199 and @xmath110 for this system as a function of the dipolar interactions @xmath38 . depending on the specifics of how this parameter space is traversed , either by adiabatic changes in @xmath99 ( vertical path ) or @xmath38 ( horizontal path ) ,",
    "the condensate will become unstable when it reaches one of the instability lines ( short and long dashed lines ) .",
    "these points of instability decrease weakly with dipolar interactions and have the approximate value @xmath250 .",
    "on the same plot we present the critical rotation frequency @xmath13 according to eq .",

    "we have assumed a bec of 150,000 @xmath0cr atoms confined within a trap with @xmath247hz . in this oblate system",
    "we see that the dipolar interactions lead to a decrease in @xmath13 , as noted in @xcite .",
    "this dependence is very weak at this value of @xmath101 , and throughout the range of @xmath38 presented it maintains the approximate value @xmath251 .",
    "importantly these results show that when the condensate becomes unstable a vortex / vortex lattice state is energetically favored . as such",
    ", we expect that in an oblate dipolar bec a vortex lattice will ultimately form when these instabilities are reached .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , we make a similar plot but for a prolate trap with @xmath244 .",
    "the instability frequencies show a somewhat similar behaviour to the oblate case .",
    "however , @xmath13 is drastically different , increasing significantly with @xmath38 .",
    "we find that this qualitative behaviour occurs consistently in prolate systems , as noted in @xcite .",
    "this introduces two regimes depending on the dipolar interactions . for @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and",
    "so we expect a vortex / vortex lattice state to form following the instability .",
    "however , for @xmath254 we find an intriguing new regime in which @xmath255 .",
    "in other words , while the instability in the vortex - free parabolic density profile still occurs , a vortex state is not energetically favorable .",
    "the final state of the system is therefore not clear . given that a prolate dipolar bec is dominated by attractive interactions ( since the dipoles lie predominantly in an attractive end - to - end configuration ) one might expect similar behavior to the case of conventional becs with attractive interactions ( @xmath256 ) where the formation of a vortex lattice can also be energetically unfavorable .",
    "suggestions for final state of the condensate in this case include centre - of - mass motion and collective oscillations , such as quadrupole modes or higher angular momentum - carrying shape excitations @xcite .",
    "however the nature of the true final state in this case is beyond the scope of this work and warrants further investigation .",
    "by calculating the static hydrodynamic solutions of a rotating dipolar bec and studying their stability , we have predicted the regimes of stable and unstable motion . in general we find that the backbending or bifurcation frequency @xmath110 decreases with increasing dipolar interactions .",
    "in addition , the onset of dynamical instability in the upper branch solutions , @xmath199 , decreases with increasing dipolar interactions .",
    "furthermore these frequencies depend on the aspect ratio of the trap .    by utilising the novel features of dipolar condensates we detail several routes to traverse the parameter space of static solutions and reach a point of instability .",
    "this can be achieved through adiabatic changes in trap rotation frequency @xmath99 , trap ellipticity @xmath44 , dipolar interactions @xmath38 and trap aspect ratio @xmath101 , all of which are experimentally tunable quantities .",
    "while the former two methods have been employed for non - dipolar becs , the latter two methods are unique to dipolar becs . in an experiment",
    "the latter instabilities would therefore demonstrate the special role played by dipolar interactions .",
    "furthermore , unlike for conventional becs with repulsive interactions , the formation of a vortex lattice following a hydrodynamic instability is not always favored and depends sensitively on the shape of the system . for a prolate bec with strong dipolar interactions",
    "there exists a regime in which the rotating spheroidal parabolic thomas - fermi density profile is unstable and yet it is energetically unfavorable to form a lattice .",
    "other outcomes may then develop , such as a centre - of - mass motion of the system or collective modes with angular momentum .",
    "however , for oblate dipolar condensates , as well as prolate condensates with weak dipolar interactions , the presence of vortices is energetically favored at the point of instability and we expect the instability to lead to the formation of a vortex lattice .      99 a. griesmaier , j .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical analysis of dilute gas bose - einstein condensates with dipolar atomic interactions under rotation in elliptical traps . working in the thomas - fermi limit </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the classical hydrodynamic equations to first derive the rotating condensate solutions and then consider their response to perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby map out the regimes of stability and instability for rotating dipolar bose - einstein condensates and in the latter case , discuss the possibility of vortex lattice formation . </S>",
    "<S> we employ our results to propose several novel routes to induce vortex lattice formation in a dipolar condensate . </S>"
