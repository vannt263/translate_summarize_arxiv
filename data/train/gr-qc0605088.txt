    "observations of type ia supernovae@xcite have led to the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "since any matter with non - negative pressure causes a deceleration , this leads to the conclusion that the universe contains a substantial amount of an exotic type of matter refered to as `` dark energy . ''",
    "a cosmological constant can account for the requisite dark energy , and indeed a model with a cosmological constant as well as ordinary baryonic matter and cold dark matter , the @xmath0cdm model , has become the standard cosmology . though it agrees quite well with the data , the @xmath0cdm model has certain disturbing features : from the point of view of planck units , the cosmological constant seems unnaturally small by about 120 orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0cdm model requires that we live in the very special cosmological era when matter and dark energy have comparable densities .",
    "these disturbing features motivate the search for alternatives to the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "one such alternative is the theory of kolb _",
    "et al_@xcite that the universe contains only ordinary matter and that the apparent acceleration is an effect of the universe s inhomogeneities .",
    "however , the work of @xcite has been criticized on many grounds.@xcite in particular , their treatment uses perturbation theory beyond its regime of validity since the effects that they try to account for are large . since a full non - perturbative treatment of an inhomogeneous",
    ", anisotropic universe is quite difficult , some authors@xcite have treated a toy problem : an inhomogeneous but spherically symmetric universe of pressureless matter .",
    "these models , the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) spacetimes,@xcite are well studied , so all that is needed is to apply them to the question of the apparent acceleration of the universe .",
    "this has been done by several authors;@xcite however , for the most part the authors of these references have used purely formal notions of the acceleration of the universe . in contrast , vanderveld _",
    "et al_@xcite and alnes _",
    "et al_@xcite have emphasized that it is more appropriate to see whether the model fits the relation between redshift and luminosity from which the cosmological acceleration was deduced .    in this paper , we will treat a class of ltb spacetimes and calculate their compatiblity with the observational data of@xcite .",
    "section 2 contains a presentation of the notation and methods to be used .",
    "results are presented in section 3 and their implications discussed in section 4 .",
    "the ltb metric takes the form@xcite @xmath1 here the area radius @xmath2 is a function of both coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 and a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath5 depends only on @xmath4 .",
    "it follows from einstein s equation that @xmath6 where an overdot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath3 and where the function @xmath7 depends only on @xmath4 .",
    "the density is given by @xmath8    it is helpful to introduce the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 by @xmath11 then equation ( [ rdot ] ) becomes @xmath12 the solution of equation ( [ adot ] ) is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a function of @xmath4 whose physical meaning is the time at which the shell of dust labeled by @xmath4 has zero radius .    at first sight",
    ", it seems that the ltb solutions depend on three arbitrary functions : @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , there is still the coordinate freedom to change @xmath4 to any function of @xmath4 .",
    "we will use that coordinate freedom to make @xmath10 constant .",
    "this makes the solutions with constant @xmath16 and zero @xmath14 the standard friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies .",
    "we will further choose the value of @xmath10 to be 4/9 so that the @xmath17 frw cosmology takes the standard form @xmath18 .",
    "in addition we will consider only models with @xmath19 .",
    "these models have a genuine big bang singularity in the sense that all dust shells are at zero radius at the same time .",
    "define the null vector @xmath20 by @xmath21 then a future directed null geodesic takes the form @xmath22 and the redshift @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where a zero subscript denotes the value of the quantity at @xmath25 .",
    "the luminosity distance is given by @xcite @xmath26 .",
    "we would like to find the luminosity distance as a function of redshift .",
    "to that end , it is helpful to find how each of these quantities varies as one goes along the past light cone of the observer .",
    "it follows from the geodesic equation that @xmath27 since @xmath28 is a function of @xmath23 and @xmath2 we need to know also how @xmath2 varies along the past light cone .",
    "we have @xmath29 it is also helpful to know how @xmath30 varies along the past light cone .",
    "we have @xmath31 thus along the past light cone we find @xmath32    if we can find all the quantities on the right hand sides of equations ( [ dzr ] ) and ( [ dza ] ) as functions of @xmath33 and @xmath30 then we will be able to numerically integrate these equations and thus find @xmath28 as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath34 we can find any function of @xmath4 and thus given a choice for the function @xmath16 we can find @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , we can find @xmath35 using equation ( [ rdot ] ) and @xmath36 using equation ( [ adot ] ) .",
    "given @xmath37 and @xmath38 we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 so all that remains then is to find @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ asoln ] ) with respect to @xmath4 and solving for @xmath41 we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 this integral can be done in closed form , and for @xmath45 takes on the value @xmath46\\ ] ] where @xmath47 now differentiating equation ( [ aprime ] ) with respect to @xmath3 and using equations ( [ adot ] ) and ( [ idef ] ) we obtain @xmath48\\ ] ]",
    "in @xcite models with @xmath17 and @xmath49 were considered , while @xcite treat models with both @xmath16 and @xmath14 nonvanishing .",
    "in contrast , we will consider models with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "there remains the choice of the function @xmath16 .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background suggest that @xmath52 whereas observations of galaxy clusters suggest that @xmath53 in matter is approximately 30% . in the context of the ltb models ,",
    "this suggest that @xmath16 should approach zero at large distances and be positive at smaller distances",
    ". we will choose @xmath16 to have the form @xmath54 where the constant @xmath55 will be chosen for the best fit with the data .",
    "let @xmath56 be the value of @xmath53 in matter at our present time and position . then in the ltb models with our choice of @xmath16 and @xmath10 we have @xmath57 thus , given a choice for the value of @xmath56 we find that the current value of @xmath30 is given by @xmath58 the initial values of @xmath2 and @xmath23 are zero .",
    "we choose the value of @xmath56 and then use equation ( [ azero ] ) to get the initial value of @xmath30 .",
    "we then numerically integrate equations ( [ dzr ] ) and ( [ dza ] ) outwards to find the luminosity distance as a function of @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "what is computed is the effective magnitude , which is @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the hubble constant and @xmath61 is a constant to be found by the best fit to an frw model . in our model",
    ", @xmath60 is simply the initial value of @xmath62 . in @xcite",
    "the models are all frw and the free parameters are @xmath63 and @xmath56 .",
    "the best fit , the one with the smallest @xmath64 is for the model with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for any other model , whether frw or not",
    ", one can then use the supernova data of @xcite to compute its @xmath64 and then subtract off the @xmath64 of that best frw fit to obtain @xmath67 which is a measure of the goodness of fit .",
    "in particular , the standard @xmath0cdm model has @xmath68 and @xmath69 and has @xmath70 .",
    "we will consider two different models : one with @xmath71 and one with @xmath72 . in each case",
    "the value of @xmath55 will be chosen for best fit with the supernova data .",
    "the errors in both @xmath73 and @xmath23 are used to compute @xmath64 .",
    "plot of effective magnitude _ vs _",
    "redshift for the @xmath74 ltb model ( curve ) and the supernova data . ]    in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) are plotted the supernova data and the @xmath75 ltb model . for this model @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the standard @xmath0cdm model ( the one with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) is a better fit to the data .",
    "however , given the possiblity of systematic uncertainties in the supernova data , it not clear whether this difference is significant . in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) the @xmath80 ltb model and the standard @xmath0cdm model are plotted .",

    "this is an even better fit to the data than the standard @xmath0cdm model . in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) the @xmath85 ltb model and the standard @xmath0cdm model",

    "is insured provided that @xmath16 is a smooth function of @xmath87 .",
    "smoothness elsewhere requires that there be no `` shell - crossing '' _ ie _ that @xmath86 not vanish . in figure ( [ fig5 ] )",
    "are plotted @xmath86 _ vs _ redshift along the past light cone for the @xmath74 and @xmath81 ltb models .",
    "since @xmath86 does not vanish , there is no shell crossing .",
    "the fairly large values of the constant @xmath55 in these models means that the spatial size of the underdensity in which we live is fairly small . in figure ( [ fig6 ] )",
    "are plotted @xmath16 _ vs _ redshift along the past light cone for the @xmath74 and @xmath81 ltb models .",
    "note that @xmath17 corresponds to an @xmath52 frw spacetime .",
    "thus in these models , we inhabit an underdensity of fairly small spatial extent in what is otherwise a spatially flat frw cosmology .",
    "this work shows that an inhomogeneous but spherically symmetric cosmological model can account for the apparent acceleration in the supernova data without any dark energy .",
    "the models have a simple form for the inhomogeneity and they fit the supernova data as well as the standard frw model with a cosmological constant does .",
    "however , this does not make the ltb spacetime a viable cosmological model .",
    "there is more cosmological data than the supernovae .",
    "in particular , data from the cosmic microwave background and from weak lensing indicate that the universe contains a large amount of matter that is `` unclumped . ''",
    "this would be accounted for by a cosmological constant ; but is unlikely to be accomodated by a ltb model or any simple modification of one .",
    "furthermore , since in these simple models , we inhabit an underdensity of farily small spatial extent , the models may not be compatible with data for galaxy counts as a function of redshift .",
    "nonetheless , the work of@xcite suggests that it might be possible to accomodate some of this additional cosmological data within the ltb models .",
    "these issues needs further study .",
    "i would like to thank anna flanagan and bob wald for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grant phy-0456655 to oakland university ."
