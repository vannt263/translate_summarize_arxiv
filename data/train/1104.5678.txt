    "quantum entanglement is well known to be an essential resource for performing certain quantum information processing tasks such as quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown to be essential for achieving an exponential speed - up over classical computation in the case of pure - state based quantum computation @xcite . however , in the case of mixed - state quantum computation , such as the model of knill and laflamme @xcite , such speed - up can be achieved without a substantial presence of entanglement @xcite .",
    "this fact has turned the attention to other types and measures of quantum correlations , like the quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite , which , while reducing to the entanglement entropy in bipartite pure states , can be non - zero in certain separable mixed states involving mixtures of non - commuting product states .",

    "the aim of this work is to embed measures of quantum correlations within a general formulation based on majorization concepts @xcite and the generalized information loss induced by a measurement with unknown result .",
    "this framework is able to provide general entropic measures of quantum correlations for mixed quantum states with properties similar to those of the qd , like vanishing just for states diagonal in a standard or conditional product basis ( i.e. , classical or partially classical states ) and reducing to the corresponding generalized entanglement entropy in the case of pure states . but",
    "as opposed to the qd and other related measures @xcite , which are based essentially on the von neumann entropy @xmath0 and rely on specific associated properties , the present measures are applicable with general entropic forms satisfying minimum requirements @xcite .",
    "for instance , they can be directly applied with the linear entropy @xmath1 which corresponds to the linear approximation @xmath2 in ( [ s ] ) and is directly related to the purity @xmath3 and the pure state concurrence @xcite , and whose evaluation in a general situation is easier than ( [ s ] ) as it does not require explicit knowledge of the eigenvalues of @xmath4 .",
    "we will show , however , that the same qualitative information can nonetheless be obtained .",
    "the positivity of the qd relies on the special concavity property of the conditional von neumann entropy @xcite , which prevents its direct extension to general entropic forms .",
    "the concepts of generalized entropies , generalized information loss by measurement and the ensuing entropic measures of quantum correlations based on minimum information loss due to local or joint local measurements are defined and discussed in [ ii ] .",
