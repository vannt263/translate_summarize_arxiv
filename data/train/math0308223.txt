    "the second theme is the analysis of the reconstruction error . while the first theme is somewhat independent of the second and is of great interest on its own , the second theme turns out to be crucially dependent on the first and is of interest for theoretical as well as practical reasons .",
    "let us start with the following abstract algorithm for analog - to - digital encoding : for each input real number @xmath3 in some interval @xmath9 , there is a map @xmath10 on a space @xmath11 , and a finite partition @xmath12 of @xmath11 . for a fixed set of real numbers @xmath13 , and a typically fixed ( but arbitrary ) initial point @xmath14",

    "note that such an encoding of real numbers is inherently different from binary - expansion ( or any other expansion in a number system ) in that , due to ( [ abs - approx ] ) , equal length portions of the sequence @xmath6 are required to be equally good in approximating the value of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , there is a `` translation - invariance '' property in the representation .",

    "such analog - to - digital encoding algorithms have been developed and used in electrical engineering for a few decades now .",
    "most notable examples are the _",
    "@xmath1 quantization _",
    "( also called @xmath1 _ modulation _ ) of audio signals and the closely related _ error - diffusion _ in digital halftoning of images .",
    "there are several sources in the electrical engineering literature on the theoretical and practical aspects of @xmath1 quantization @xcite .",
    "digital halftoning and its connections to @xmath1 quantization can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath1 quantization has also received interest in the mathematical community , especially in approximation theory and information theory , since a very important question is the rate of convergence in ( [ general - abs - approx ] ) @xcite .",
    "we give in section [ describe - sd ] the original description of an @xmath2th order @xmath1 modulation scheme in terms of difference equations .",
    "the underlying specific map @xmath10 , which we then refer to as @xmath35 ( the `` modulator map '' ) is described in section [ piecewise - affine ] ; @xmath35 is the piecewise affine transformation on @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath39 lower triangular matrix of @xmath5 s and @xmath40 .",

    "a scheme is said to be _ stable _ if for each @xmath3 , forward trajectories under the action of @xmath35 are bounded in @xmath0 .",
    "( more refined definitions of stability will be given in section [ piecewise - affine ] . )",
    "the partition @xmath41 is an essential part of the algorithm for its central role in stability .",
    "it is natural to measure the accuracy of a scheme by how fast the worst case error @xmath47 converges to zero .",
    "it is known that for an @xmath2th order stable scheme , and an appropriate choice for the family @xmath48 of filters , this quantity is @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the hidden constant depends on the scheme as well as the input sequence @xmath3 . here ,",
    "the exponent @xmath2 is not sharp ; in fact , for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , improvements have been given for various schemes @xcite .",
    "we will review the basic approximation properties of @xmath1 quantization in section [ describe - sd ] .    in applications , it is also common to measure the error in the root mean square norm due its more robust nature ( this norm is defined in section [ sec - error ] ) .",
    "it is known for a small class of schemes we call _ ideal _ , and a small class of sequences ( basically , constants and pure sinusoids ) that this norm , when averaged over a smooth distribution of values of @xmath3 , has the asymptotic behavior @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the analyses employed in obtaining these results rely on very special properties of the ideal schemes , such as employing an ( effective ) @xmath2-bit uniform quantizer for the @xmath2th order scheme .",
    "it was not known how to extend these results to low - bit schemes ( in particular , @xmath5-bit schemes ) of high order for which experimental results and simulation suggested similar asymptotical behavior for the root mean square error .",
    "it is the topic of this paper to provide a general framework and methodology to analyze @xmath1 quantization in an arbitrary setup ( in terms of partition and number of bits ) when inputs are constant sequences . with regards to the first theme of this paper",
    ", we prove in section [ sec - tiling ] that the maps @xmath35 have an outstanding property of yielding _ tiling invariant sets _",
    ", up to a multiplicity that is determined by the map .",
    "in the particular case of single tiles being invariant under @xmath35 ( which also appears to be systematically satisfied by all practical @xmath1 quantization schemes ) , we develop a spectral theory of @xmath1 quantization .",
    "this constitutes the second theme of the paper .",

    "in addition to producing the output sequence @xmath6 , the role of the quantizer @xmath93 of a @xmath1 modulator is to keep the variables @xmath94 bounded . a more precise definition of this notion of stability will be given later .",
    "let us see how boundedness of @xmath94 results in a simple reconstruction algorithm .",
    "it can be seen directly from ( [ state - eq-1 ] ) that for each @xmath95 , the state variable @xmath94 satisfies @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the difference operator defined by @xmath98 = v[n]-v[n{-}1]$ ] .",

    "this approximation result can be generalized easily .",
    "for simplicity of the discussion , let us assume that the difference equation ( [ x - q = du ] ) is satisfied on the whole of @xmath54 ( with some care , this can be achieved via backwards iteration of ( [ state - eq-1 ] ) ) .",

    "since @xmath3 is a constant sequence , we have @xmath106",
    ". therefore @xmath107 where at the last step we have used commutativity of convolutional operators . from this , we obtain @xmath108 it is not hard to show that there is a family of averaging kernels @xmath109 ( which can be , for instance , discrete b - splines of degree @xmath2 ) with support size growing linearly in @xmath8 such that @xmath110 . combined with ( [ err - eq - bnd ] ) , this yields the bound @xmath49 on the uniform approximation error .",
    "a proof of this result in the more general setting of oversampling of bandlimited functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we shall be interested in the mean square error ( also called , the _ time - averaged square error _ ) of approximation defined by @xmath111 \\big |^2,\\ ] ] provided the limit exists ( otherwise the @xmath112 is replaced by a @xmath113 ) .",

    "there has also been recent research on more general quantization rules and their benefits @xcite .",
    "typically , an electrical circuit can not handle arbitrarily large amplitudes , and clips off quantities that are beyond certain values .",

    "let us emphasize once again that the quantization rule is crucial in the stability of the system .",

    "these two notions are closely related .",
    "clearly , positive stability implies stability . on the other hand , in a stable scheme ,",

    "most of the engineering practice relies on extensive numerical simulation .    in figure [ attractor ]",
