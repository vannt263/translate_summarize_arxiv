    ", we will call @xmath3 ( or @xmath6 ) incompressible , if @xmath7 is a @xmath4-injective embedding .",
    "we will suppose throughout that all the boundary components of @xmath1 are incompressible .",
    "all 3-manifolds will be assumed to be irreducible and @xmath8-irreducible , i.e every embedded 2-sphere bounds a 3-ball and there are no embedded 2-sided projective planes .",
    "such a 3-manifold @xmath0 will be called atoroidal , if given any @xmath4-injective map @xmath9 from a torus or klein bottle into @xmath0 , @xmath7 is homotopic to a map into one of the boundary components of @xmath1 .",
    "any surface or map which is homotopic into a boundary surface of @xmath1 will be called peripheral .    for basic 3-manifold theory , see either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "an ideal triangulation @xmath10 of @xmath0 will be a cell complex which is a decomposition of @xmath0 into tetrahedra @xmath11 glued along their faces and edges , so that the vertices of the tetrahedra are all removed .",
    "moreover the link of each such missing vertex will be a klein bottle or torus .",
    "we call these links the peripheral surfaces of @xmath0 . note that tetrahedra may have faces and edges self - identified . using moise s construction of triangulations of 3-manifolds @xcite , one can convert a triangulation of @xmath1 into such an ideal triangulation , by collapsing the boundary surfaces to ideal vertices and also collapsing edges which join the ideal vertices to the interior vertices .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of such collapsing procedures .",
    "one has to ensure that at each stage of such collapsings , that the topological type of @xmath0 does not change .",
    "we now summarize haken s theory of normal surfaces @xcite , as extended by thurston to deal with spun normal surfaces in ideal triangulations ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . given an abstract tetrahedron @xmath12 with vertices @xmath13 , there are four normal triangular disk types , cutting off small neighborhoods of each of the four vertices .",
    "there are also three normal quadrilateral disk types , which separate pairs of opposite edges , such as @xmath14 .",
    "each tetrahedron @xmath15 of @xmath10 contributes 7 coordinates which are the numbers @xmath16 of each of the normal disk types .",
    "we can form a vector of integers of length @xmath17 from a list of these coordinates @xmath16 , @xmath18 .    a normal surface @xmath19 is formed by gluing finitely many normal disk types together and its coordinate vector",
    "is denoted by @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "@xmath20 $ ] is called the normal class of @xmath19 .",
    "there are @xmath21 compatibility equations for the coordinates of a normal surface , each of the form @xmath22 , where the left side of the equation gives the number of normal triangles and quadrilaterals with a particular normal arc type in the boundary , e.g the arc running between edges @xmath23 in @xmath12 . if the face @xmath24 is glued to @xmath25 of the tetrahedron @xmath26 , then @xmath27 are the number of normal triangles and quadrilaterals with the boundary normal arc type running between @xmath28 in @xmath29 .",
    "note that we allow self identifications of tetrahedra and hence also of normal disk types .",
    "note that normal surfaces may be embedded , immersed or branched .",
    "it turns out that the solution space @xmath30 of these compatibility equations in @xmath31 has dimension @xmath32 , i.e. there are @xmath33 redundant compatibility equations .",
    "the non - negative integer solutions in @xmath30 are then normal surfaces and we can regard @xmath32 as the dimension of the space of these surfaces . for a proof , see @xcite .",
    "also in @xcite , the dimension of the space @xmath34 of spun and ordinary normal surfaces is computed .",
    "in fact , if @xmath35 is the number of tori and klein bottle boundary components of @xmath1 , then it is shown there that the dimension of @xmath34 is @xmath36 .    in an ideal triangulation @xmath10 , a spun normal surface @xmath19 is formed by gluing infinitely many normal disk types together . by definition ,",
    "there are finitely many quadrilaterals and infinitely many triangular disks in such a spun normal surface . a connected neighborhood ( in @xmath19 ) of these quadrilaterals",
    "can be formed by adding finite regions of triangles , yielding a compact core @xmath37 of @xmath19 .",
    "then the closure of @xmath38 is a collection of non - compact triangular regions of @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to see that these regions must then all be half open annuli .",
    "the reason is that any such region projects onto a boundary surface of @xmath1 , which becomes a triangulated klein bottle or torus , when pushed into @xmath0 as a normal surface .",
    "the projection is locally one - to - one and so the region must be an annulus winding around the boundary surface .    now to form a vector space @xmath34 of spun and ordinary normal surfaces @xmath19 , we will consider only the quadrilateral coordinates of each @xmath19 .",
    "so @xmath34 will be a subspace of @xmath39 .",
    "this idea has been studied previously in @xcite , in the case of ordinary normal surface theory in standard ( closed ) triangulations and is called @xmath40 normal surface theory . for spun normal surfaces ,",
    "@xmath40 theory has been investigated in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "there are @xmath33 compatibility equations for the quadrilaterals and in @xcite , it is shown there are @xmath35 redundancies . in an ideal triangulation , the solutions to these equations are naturally either normal or spun normal surfaces .",
    "the only surfaces which are not ` seen ' by this theory , are the boundary klein bottles and tori , formed entirely of triangular disk types . if we added these in also , the theory would have dimension @xmath41",
    ". however these boundary surfaces play no significant role , so it is reasonable to leave them out of consideration .",
    "spun normal surfaces have been used in an interesting way by stefan tillmann @xcite , to study essential splitting surfaces arising from representation varieties in culler - shalen theory .",
    "finally we briefly discuss the theory of ( generalised ) almost normal surfaces , which turns out to give an elegant way of describing the combinatorial obstruction to deform a taut structure into an angle structure .",
    "the disks of generalised almost normal surface theory are properly embedded in the tetrahedra and have boundary loops consisting of normal arcs .",
    "it is an elementary exercise to check that such loops can be described as the boundary of a regular neighbourhood of an embedded arc in the boundary of a tetrahedron , where the latter arc runs between two vertices and consists of normal arcs plus two arcs from the vertices to interior points of edges not containing the vertices .",
    "( see figure 1 ) . as a consequence , every such disk , which is not a triangle or quadrilateral , has length @xmath42 and we will refer to it as a @xmath42-gon",
    ". we will find an interesting connection between these @xmath42-gons , for @xmath43 , and branch points of normal classes !",
    "= 2.5 in    in our work , it turns out to be sufficient to use normal and generalised almost normal surfaces .",
    "however , there is an interesting interaction with spun normal surface theory , which we will mention for completeness .",
    "taut triangulations were introduced by lackenby @xcite , based on gabai s theory of taut foliations , as developed by scharlemann using sutured hierarchies .",
    "lackenby showed that any irreducible atoroidal orientable compact 3-manifold with tori boundary has ideal triangulations which admit taut structures .",
    "angle structures have been discussed by casson and rivin and are sometimes called semi - hyperbolic structures .",
    "one way of viewing an angle structure , is to associate all the tetrahedra with ideal hyperbolic simplices , in such a way that the sums of the dihedral angles about each edge of the triangulation are @xmath44 .",
    "the latter is one of thurston s three hyperbolic gluing conditions .",
    "one can then view a taut structure as a limit of such angle structures . for our purposes ,",
    "we introduce a slightly weaker version of tautness than used by lackenby @xcite .",
    "this fits very conveniently with angle structures and also enables us to consider non - orientable manifolds .",
    "we also introduce the notion of a semi - angle structure , as a convenient interpolation between angle structures and taut structures .",
    "_ given an ideal triangulation @xmath10 of @xmath0 , a taut structure is an assignment of angles @xmath45 or @xmath46 to the dihedral angles at edges between pairs of faces in each tetrahedron @xmath11 of @xmath10 .",
    "these angles satisfy two conditions ; _    - for each @xmath15 there are four @xmath45 dihedral angles and two @xmath46 angles .",
    "the @xmath46 angles are at an opposite pair of edges of @xmath15 .    - for every edge @xmath47 of @xmath10 , the sum of all the dihedral angles around @xmath47 is exactly @xmath44 .",
    "next , we discuss the concept of angle structures as introduced by casson and rivin .    _",
    "an angle structure is an assignment of non - zero dihedral angles @xmath48 to each tetrahedron @xmath15 of an ideal triangulation of @xmath0 with the following conditions ; _    - each opposite pair of edges of @xmath15 has the same dihedral angle , so the 3 pairs of opposite edges have dihedral values @xmath48 .    - @xmath49 .    -",
    "the sum of all the dihedral angles around an edge of @xmath0 is @xmath44 .",
    "notice that an ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron @xmath12 has all @xmath50 vertices on the 2-sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space @xmath51 .",
    "each face is an ideal hyperbolic triangle and it is well - known ( cf @xcite ) that the dihedral angles for such a tetrahedron are equal for opposite pairs of edges of @xmath12 and sum to @xmath46 .",
    "so the conditions of an angle structure are part of the compatibility conditions for gluing together choices of hyperbolic metrics on the tetrahedra @xmath11 of @xmath10 to form a ( complete ) hyperbolic metric .",
    "finally we relax the definition of angle structure to give the new definition of a semi - angle structure .",
    "note that both angle structures and taut structures are examples of semi - angle structures .",
    "a semi - angle structure satisfies the same conditions as an angle structure except that all dihedral angles are non - negative rather than strictly positive .",
    "combinatorial restrictions on an ideal triangulation @xmath10 , are related to the possibility of finding an angle structure using @xmath10 .",
    "the following discussion is based on an inspiring talk given by casson in montreal in 1995 . in @xcite and @xcite , these conditions on ideal triangulations are developed for the more difficult case of triangulations of closed 3-manifolds .",
    "_ we say that an ideal triangulation @xmath10 of @xmath0 is 0-efficient , if there are no embedded normal spheres or projective planes .",
    "we say that @xmath10 is 1-efficient , if @xmath10 is 0-efficient and there are no embedded normal tori or klein bottles , except for the boundary tori and klein bottles of @xmath1 .",
    "finally we say that @xmath10 is strongly 1-efficient if there are no singular or embedded normal spheres , projective planes , tori or klein bottles , except for coverings of the boundary surfaces , realised as normal surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "_    an initial connection between these concepts is given by the following result , due to casson and rivin .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is the interior of a compact 3-manifold @xmath1 with tori and klein bottle boundary components and has an ideal triangulation @xmath10 with an angle structure .",
    "then @xmath0 is irreducible , @xmath8-irreducible and atoroidal .",
    "moreover @xmath10 is strongly 1-efficient .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 has an embedded essential 2-sphere @xmath19 ( which does not bound a 3-cell ) , an embedded 2-sided projective plane @xmath52 or a @xmath4-injective map @xmath2 of a torus or klein bottle , which is not homotopic into a boundary component of @xmath1 .",
    "we claim that @xmath19 or @xmath52 or @xmath6 can be isotoped or homotoped to be an embedded or immersed normal surface .",
    "this follows by standard arguments , initially due to haken ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that for the case of the immersed torus , one can use the method of freedman , hass , scott @xcite , to lift a map homotopic to @xmath7 to an embedding in a covering space of @xmath0 and so haken s method applies also in this covering space .",
    "now the dihedral angles associated with edges of ideal tetrahedra can also be given to corresponding vertices of the triangular and quadrilateral normal disk types .",
    "the condition for an angle structure that the sum of the 3 dihedral angles of a tetrahedron is @xmath46 , means that the angle sum for the vertices of any normal triangle is also @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the angle sum for the vertices of any normal quadrilateral is of the form @xmath53 where @xmath48 are the 3 dihedral angles for pairs of opposite edges of the tetrahedron containing the quadrilateral .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this angle sum is @xmath54 and is therefore @xmath55 .",
    "( see figure 2 ) .",
    "= 2.7 in    next , notice that the other angle structure condition that the dihedral angles around an edge add up to @xmath44 , implies the same is true for any vertex of any immersed normal surface @xmath56 .",
    "therefore we find that the euler characteristic of any immersed normal surface @xmath57 is non - positive and is strictly negative if there are any quadrilaterals .",
    "in fact , by gauss bonnet , the euler characteristic @xmath58 can be calculated by summing @xmath59 and @xmath60 over all normal triangles with angles @xmath48 and normal quadrilaterals with angles @xmath61 and dividing the total by @xmath44 .",
    "so this shows that @xmath0 can not have any embedded ( or immersed ) normal spheres or projective planes and is therefore irreducible and @xmath8-irreducible .",
    "moreover , any immersed normal torus or klein bottle must consist only of triangular normal disks and is therefore a covering of one of the peripheral normal surfaces of @xmath0 , as required in an atoroidal manifold .",
    "this also establishes that @xmath0 is strongly 1-efficient .    * remarks * _ note that a similar argument also shows that for the case of an angle structure , there are no non boundary parallel embedded or immersed spun normal annuli or mobius bands .",
    "the reason is that any spun normal surface with some quadrilaterals would have negative euler characteristic .",
    "hence for a spun normal annulus or mobius band , there can only be triangular normal disks and the surface is then boundary parallel . _    to complete this section , we also look at the situation of a taut or semi - angle structure .",
    "this extends a result due to lackenby @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is the interior of a compact 3-manifold @xmath1 with tori and klein bottle boundary components and has an ideal triangulation @xmath10 with a taut or semi - angle structure .",
    "then @xmath0 is irreducible , @xmath8-irreducible and @xmath10 is 0-efficient .",
    "moreover any embedded normal torus or klein bottle must be incompressible .",
    "if @xmath0 is also atoroidal , then @xmath10 is strongly 1-efficient .    for simplicity , we assume a taut structure and leave it to the reader to make the necessary simple modifications for the case of a semi - angle structure .",
    "for the first part of this theorem , we can follow exactly the same method as in the previous theorem .",
    "namely , angles can be associated to the vertices of any embedded or immersed normal surface in @xmath0 using @xmath45 and @xmath46 as dihedral angles at edges of tetrahedra of @xmath10 , coming from the taut structure . as in theorem 2.4",
    ", it then follows that the angle sum of any normal triangle is @xmath46 and for quadrilaterals is either @xmath46 or @xmath44 .",
    "therefore there can not be any embedded normal spheres or projective planes and @xmath0 is irreducible , @xmath8-irreducible and @xmath10 is 0-efficient exactly as before .",
    "next , consider an embedded normal torus or klein bottle @xmath3 in @xmath0 which is not @xmath4-injective . by the loop theorem and dehn s lemma",
    ", there must be an embedded compressing disk for @xmath3 .",
    "( if @xmath3 is one - sided , we can work instead with the boundary of a small regular neighbourhood , which is a two - sided torus or klein bottle ) .",
    "it easily follows that either @xmath3 is a torus bounding a solid torus or cube - with - knotted hole or @xmath3 is a klein bottle bounding a non - orientable solid torus .",
    "( we know by the previous paragraph that there are no projective planes in @xmath0 so this rules out a disk cutting the klein bottle into two projective planes ) .",
    "the case of cube - with - knotted hole can be easily ruled out , since an embedded 2-sphere bounding a 3-cell containing @xmath3 can be shrunk relative to @xmath10 using @xmath3 as a barrier as in @xcite to give a normal 2-sphere . but",
    "this contradicts our previous observation that @xmath10 is 0-efficient .    to rule out @xmath3 bounding a solid torus ( orientable or not , depending on whether @xmath3 is a torus or klein bottle ) , we use the method of sweepouts or thin position ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . using @xmath3 as a barrier",
    ", we can sweep across the normal solid torus getting a minimax value of complexity for a moving torus or klein bottle .",
    "this minimax surface @xmath62 is almost normal , so since we have a @xmath45-efficient triangulation , must be normal except for a single octagonal disk properly embedded in one of the tetrahedra .",
    "( the other possibility for the minimax torus or klein bottle is a normal sphere with a tube attached parallel to an edge and @xmath45-efficiency rules this out ) .",
    "now we can do the same euler characteristic calculation for @xmath62 using the angles induced by the taut structure .",
    "it is easy to see for the octagon , the vertex angle sum @xmath63 is either @xmath44 or @xmath64 .",
    "( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the contribution towards @xmath65 from the octagon is then @xmath66 so is always negative .",
    "since all the normal triangles and quadrilaterals also make non - positive contributions , it follows that @xmath67 and so @xmath62 can not be a klein bottle or torus .",
    "this completes the proof that any embedded normal torus or klein bottle must be @xmath4-injective .",
    "finally if @xmath0 is atoroidal , we need to prove that @xmath10 is strongly 1-efficient .",
    "the idea is to use a covering space approach similar to the one in @xcite , together with the argument in the preceding paragraph about non-@xmath4-injective ( compressible ) normal tori and klein bottles .",
    "assume first that there is an embedded or immersed @xmath4-injective normal torus or klein bottle @xmath2 which is not a covering of a peripheral torus or klein bottle . by the atoroidal assumption , we know that the map @xmath7 is homotopic to a map into such a peripheral normal surface , which we denote by @xmath68",
    ". let @xmath69 be the covering of @xmath1 ( the compactification of @xmath0 ) corresponding to the peripheral subgroup @xmath70 of @xmath71 . denote by @xmath72 an embedded lift of @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "now it is well - known ( see e.g @xcite ) that this covering space @xmath69 is almost compact , i.e is the result of removing part of one boundary component of a product of a torus or klein bottle and an interval .",
    "it is then immediate that we can find a new embedded torus or klein bottle @xmath73 which is parallel to the lifted surface @xmath72 in @xmath69 , so that there is a lift @xmath74 of the map @xmath7 so that @xmath75 is contained in the product region between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "but then , by the usual barrier argument as in @xcite , we can isotopically shrink @xmath73 to an embedded normal surface @xmath76 using @xmath75 as the barrier .",
    "( see figure 4 ) .",
    "but now a sweepout across the product region between @xmath76 and @xmath72 in @xmath69 gives an almost normal torus or klein bottle in the interior @xmath77 of @xmath69 .",
    "the taut structure on @xmath10 lifts to a taut structure on the lifted triangulation @xmath78 on @xmath77 .",
    "since we have shown previously there can not be an embedded almost normal torus or klein bottle in a taut triangulation , so this case is done .",
    "= 2.3 in    the last case to consider is a compressible immersed normal torus or klein bottle @xmath2 .",
    "suppose first that the image @xmath79 in @xmath80 is trivial . in this case , the map @xmath7 lifts to @xmath81 in the universal covering space @xmath82 of @xmath0 .",
    "but the taut structure on @xmath10 obviously lifts to a taut structure on the lifted triangulation @xmath83 on @xmath82 .",
    "also @xmath84 is almost compact ( see e.g @xcite ) , so is an open 3-cell .",
    "we can find an embedded 2-sphere @xmath19 in @xmath82 which bounds a 3-cell containing @xmath85 and as previously , can use @xmath85 as a barrier and shrink @xmath19 to a normal 2-sphere .",
    "but we have shown before there are no such normal 2-spheres in a taut triangulation @xmath83 so this gives a contradiction .",
    "assume secondly that the image @xmath79 in @xmath80 is non trivial .",
    "but not an isomorphic copy of @xmath86 .",
    "then it is easy to see that the only possibility is a cyclic image isomorphic to @xmath87 , since @xmath80 has no torsion .",
    "consequently , there is an essential simple curve @xmath88 in @xmath3 with homotopy class in @xmath86 generating the kernel of @xmath89 .",
    "we can define a continuous map of a disk @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 .    to complete this case ,",
    "the idea is to pull back the triangulation @xmath10 of @xmath0 to @xmath92 , using @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , there is a natural way to also pull back the taut structure on @xmath10 to a ` taut ' structure on @xmath92 .",
    "then a gauss bonnet argument similar to that in theorem 2.5 gives a contradiction .",
    "after a small perturbation , it can be assumed that @xmath93 is transverse to the triangulation @xmath10 .",
    "so the pull back of the edges of @xmath10 are interior vertices in @xmath92 and the pull back of the faces of @xmath10 are arcs and loops in @xmath92 .",
    "we can simplify the map @xmath93 by an obvious homotopy to eliminate any loops in the preimage of the faces . for",
    "if @xmath94 is an innermost such loop bounding a subdisk @xmath95 of @xmath92 , we can homotop @xmath93 into the face of @xmath10 containing @xmath96 .",

    "consequently we may assume that the graph is connected and it defines a cell decomposition of @xmath92 .",
    "next , any polygonal face @xmath52 of the cell decomposition of @xmath92 which is a bigon can be removed by a further homotopy of @xmath93 . for",
    "it is easy to see that first @xmath102 can be homotoped into an edge or face of @xmath10 and then @xmath93 can be pushed off this edge or face on a small neighbourhood of @xmath52 in @xmath92 .",

    "this will eliminate @xmath52 as claimed and so decrease the number of faces of the cell decomposition . in a similar manner ,",
    "any boundary edge @xmath103 of the cell decomposition with image having both ends on the same edge of @xmath10 can be eliminated by a homotopy of @xmath93 , by homotoping the map of @xmath103 into the edge and then perturbing the image of @xmath103 off the edge , simplifying the cell decomposition of @xmath92 .",

    "again as there are no adjacent angles of @xmath46 , the contribution to @xmath114 is also non - positive .",
    "but then the euler characteristic of @xmath92 will not be one , and this contradiction establishes strong 1-efficiency of @xmath10 .    _ any immersed or branched normal surface with non - negative euler characteristic is normally boundary parallel , if @xmath0 has an angle structure or is atoroidal and has a taut or semi - angle structure on @xmath10 .",

    ", we note a connection between strong 1-efficiency and the existence of spun normal surfaces with zero euler characteristic .",
    "it is elementary to check by the same method as in theorem 2.4 that if @xmath10 has an angle structure , then there can not be any such spun normal surfaces .",
    "however by the next result , strong 1-efficiency guarantees this .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 is a strongly 1-efficient ideal triangulation of @xmath0 .",
    "then there are no spun normal surfaces @xmath127 with zero euler characteristic in @xmath0 .    by passing to 2-fold covering spaces , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath0 is orientable and @xmath127 is an annulus , rather than possibly a mobius band .",
    "let @xmath128 denote the immersion or embedding of @xmath127 and let @xmath72 denote one of the peripheral tori with one of the half open annuli ends of @xmath127 projecting onto @xmath72",

    "so if @xmath134 has both half open annuli ( its two ends ) covering the same lift @xmath135 of the peripheral surface @xmath72 for @xmath77 , then we can use @xmath136 as a barrier as in @xcite and find an embedded normal torus in @xmath137 which is not peripheral .",
    "this contradicts our assumption that @xmath0 is strongly 1-efficient . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath134 has its second half open annulus ( other end ) covering a second peripneral surface , then clearly @xmath138 is not homotopic , keeping its structure at infinity fixed , into a neighbourhood of @xmath72 .",
    "consequently we can replace @xmath138 by a compact properly immersed annulus denoted @xmath139 in @xmath1 , by replacing the half open annular ends by compact annular ends finishing at boundary components of @xmath1 .",
    "then either this annulus @xmath139 has both ends on @xmath72 and is not homotopic keeping its boundary fixed into @xmath72 , or the annulus has ends on two different peripheral tori .",

    "next , for this particular linear combination of the system ( * ) , the condition that all the coefficients of the variables on the left side are non negative corresponds to the requirement that all the quadrilaterals in @xmath19 are taken with non negative multiplicity .",
    "adding up the contributions from the individual equations is the same as adding up the corresponding multiples of the coordinates in the basis vectors @xmath191 .",

    "otherwise we have precisely the condition that there are no non peripheral branched classes with only quadrilaterals having two angles @xmath46 and no quadrilaterals with all angles zero .",

    "( see figure 11 ) . if @xmath208 are not relatively prime , we get @xmath113 copies of such a disk where @xmath113 is the g.c.d of @xmath208 and @xmath209 , given @xmath208 quadrilaterals with two angles @xmath46 and two angles zero",
    ". consequently we can do regular branch cuts between compatible normal disk types , i.e pairs of quadrilaterals of the same type or triangles and quadrilaterals or between triangles , and replace sets of incompatible quadrilaterals with @xmath207-gons .",
    "so we can find an embedded generalized almost normal surface corresponding to a normal class @xmath19 with branch points and only quadrilaterals with angle sum @xmath44 in a taut structure .",
    "notice that each @xmath210-gon produced in this manner has @xmath211 angles @xmath46 and @xmath211 angles zero .",
    "it is easy to see that one can not deform the taut structure to an angle structure , given any embedded almost normal surface containing such @xmath210-gons . for the formula for euler characteristic of such a surface will decrease , under the deformation of a taut structure to an angle structure , by the same argument as in theorem 2.4 .",
    "since euler characteristic can not change , this is an interesting illustration of why such surfaces are an obstruction to the existence of angle structures near the taut structure .",
    "we begin with a simple example of a taut triangulation which is strongly 1-efficient but has a normal classes with branch points , which is the obstruction to finding an angle structure .",
    "start with the standard ideal triangulation of the figure 8 knot space @xmath0 as in @xcite and ` blow up ' two faces into two new tetrahedra . by this",
    "we mean split open along two faces which belong to one of the two tetrahedra and which glue together into a copy of the once punctured torus which is a seifert surface for @xmath0 .",
    "now glue one tetrahedron to these two faces and then another onto the free two faces of the first one .",
    "do this so that the boundary pattern of the two free faces of the second tetrahedron is the same as the original faces .",
    "( see figure 12 ) .",
    "so we can glue back together to get a new taut triangulation with 4 tetrahedra , which comes from the taut triangulation corresponding to the fibered structure on @xmath0 .",
    "( note there are two other taut structures on @xmath0 which we are not considering here ) .",
    "next , it is easy to find a normal class with branch points by taking one of each quadrilateral type with two angles @xmath46 in both of the new tetrahedra and complete the normal class with triangles .",
    "using branch cuts , one can also convert the two quadrilaterals with two angles @xmath46 into a single quadrilateral with all angles @xmath45 in each of the new tetrahedra .",
    "the remainder of the surface is then triangles .",
    "it can be seen that this is an embedded surface of genus 2 given by adding a tube to the peripheral torus along the common edge between the two faces shared by the two new tetrahedra .",
    "so this is a simple taut triangulation which does not admit an angle structure .",
    "= 4.5 in    next , take any ideal taut triangulation of an orientable punctured surface bundle over a circle with pseudo anosov monodromy , where there can be several punctures and the surface can have higher genus .",
    "assume that the triangulation is formed by taking an ideal triangulation of the surface and adding tetrahedra along two faces at a time , similar to the structure on the figure 8 knot space .",
    "suppose that in the sequence of tetrahedra , we find two at different positions which are added along two faces with edge loops which are isotopic .",
    "now we can perform a similar construction to the previous paragraph , assuming that the isotopy between edge loops is as in the figure 8 knot example .",
    "namely take the corresponding quadrilaterals with all angles @xmath45 in each of these two tetrahedra .",
    "( see figure 13 ) .",
    "we can connect these by disks and annuli , since the arcs at the top and bottom of the octagons are isotopic .",
    "these disks and annuli can be made normal and so we again get a genus two generalized almost normal surface which has a ( big ) tube attached to the peripheral torus .",
    "so this shows that many taut triangulations of an orientable punctured surface bundle over a circle with pseudo anosov monodromy do not admit angle structures .",
    "take @xmath0 as any once - punctured torus bundle over the circle with monodromy as a matrix @xmath212 in @xmath213 having @xmath214 .",
    "as is well known , these are precisely the bundles which are irreducible and atoroidal and so admit complete hyperbolic structures of finite volume .",
    "we want to consider the canonical ideal triangulation as in the first example , again given by triangulating the once punctured torus by two ideal triangles glued together and then adding a sequence of ideal tetrahedra along two faces at a time .",
    "moreover we are only interested in such sequences which do not admit a ` cancelling pair ' as in the first example , i.e there are no edges of degree two in the triangulation .    in a recent paper on the arxiv @xcite , gueritaud shows directly that these triangulations can be given    hyperbolic structures which match to produce the complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume . here",
    "we wish to show that the obstruction to deforming the taut structure coming from the fiber bundle to an angle structure always vanishes .",
    "so this gives another proof that these triangulations all admit angle structures and also gives some insight into the behaviour of the obstruction normal classes .",
    "start with a square @xmath215 which is glued up in the usual way to form a once - punctured torus @xmath3 , so after opposite sides are identified together , the single vertex is removed .",
    "suppose also that the diagonal edge @xmath216 is included so as to produce an ideal triangulation of @xmath3 .",
    "we also suppose that an ideal tetrahedron @xmath12 is glued onto @xmath3 so that the two triangles of @xmath3 become two faces of @xmath12 . a second tetrahedron @xmath26 with vertices @xmath217 is then glued onto the two bottom faces of @xmath12 which are @xmath218 and @xmath219 by either ;    @xmath220 and @xmath221 or @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "( see figure 14 ) .",
    "note that these are the only two possibilities since the third way of gluing on @xmath26 would make the two tetrahedra @xmath224 a cancelling pair with an edge of degree 2 , contrary to hypothesis .",
    "there are precisely three possibilities since we are gluing together two once - punctured tori divided into three triangles with three edges .",
    "so once a single edge matching is chosen , the gluing is determined .",
    "we now study how a normal class with quadrilaterals with two dihedral angles @xmath46 but none with all angles @xmath45 can look inside these two tetrahedra . in the triangle @xmath225 ( respectively @xmath226 ) ,",
    "let @xmath227 ( respectively @xmath228 ) denote the number of normal arcs which cut off the vertices @xmath229 ( respectively @xmath230 ) .",
    "then it is straightforward to check that by the usual compatibility equations for normal surface theory , the normal arcs on the once - punctured torus @xmath3 must glue up to form normal curves , so satisfy the compatibility equations that the number of ends of normal arcs on the two sides of an edge must agree .",
    "we see immediately that this forces @xmath231 .",
    "next suppose that the numbers of triangular disks at the vertices @xmath232 in @xmath12 are @xmath233 respectively and the number of quadrilaterals disjoint from the edges @xmath234 and @xmath235 are @xmath236 respectively also .",
    "finally let @xmath237 denote the number of normal arcs cutting off vertices @xmath238 in the triangle @xmath239 , so that @xmath240 are the number of normal arcs cutting off the vertices @xmath241 in the triangle @xmath242 .",
    "we get the system of equations @xmath243 so @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "we can write our system then as @xmath246 let @xmath247",
    ". then @xmath248 therefore , if @xmath249 we conclude that the total number of normal arcs @xmath250 .",
    "notice that if @xmath251 is larger than either @xmath252 or @xmath35 , then consequentially @xmath253 , so @xmath249 . after gluing on @xmath26 ,",
    "there are two possibilities for which of the three integers @xmath237 plays the role of @xmath251 in the new tetrahedron . by this , we mean the normal arc cutting off @xmath254 ( or @xmath255 ) on the top two faces of @xmath26 , which does not have ends on the top diagonal .",
    "the first gluing pattern above gives @xmath256 and the second @xmath257 for this normal arc .",
    "however notice now that @xmath258 and so neither @xmath257 nor @xmath256 is the smallest of the three numbers @xmath237 . so the computation for the second tetrahedron will result in the same conclusion as the first , namely the total number of normal arcs in the bottom two faces is larger than the number in the top two faces .",
    "but we are now trapped in a cycle and so can not go around the bundle and return to the top of the tetrahedron @xmath12 . at every stage",
    "the total number of normal arcs is increasing , so we can not glue the top to the bottom to close up the normal class .",
    "so this shows that there can not be a normal class with only quadrilaterals which are disjoint from the edges @xmath234 and @xmath235 , in this case .",
    "the case when @xmath259 is entirely similar and corresponds to ` turning the bundle upside down ' , i.e interchanging the roles of the top and bottom two faces of each tetrahedron .",
    "we see by symmetry that the total number of normal arcs must monotonically decrease as we traverse the bundle and again we can not close up the normal class around the bundle , as in the previous case .",
    "if @xmath260 , i.e @xmath261 , then the total number of normal arcs does not change across the first tetrahedron .",
    "if this total increases across the second tetrahedron , we are back in the first case above , and if it decreases , we are in the second situation .",
    "so it remains to consider the case where in traversing the second tetrahedron @xmath26 , we also have the same total number of normal arcs .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that either @xmath262 or @xmath263 or @xmath264 . consequently",
    ", either there are no quadrilaterals at all , which is not allowed for the normal classes we are interested in constructing , or there is a single quadrilateral class in each tetrahedron .",
    "the latter is easily checked to correspond to the case of monodromy with trace @xmath265 which has been excluded , so the discussion is complete .",
    "we set out to try to construct angle structures from lackenby s taut structures @xcite . in our next paper @xcite .",
    "we find that taut structures are very common amongst minimal small ideal triangulations .",
    "in some sense , there are too many taut triangulations and the obstruction found in section 2 above , shows that many of these do not admit angle structures .",
    "there are also most likely too many ideal triangulations with angle structures and further work needs to be done to identify other obstructions to finding hyperbolic structures via this approach . to conclude",
    ", we make some observations about our obstruction . here",
    "we restrict to irreducible , @xmath8-irreducible and atoroidal manifolds with incompressible tori and klein bottle boundary components .",
    "if @xmath0 has a number of different taut and semi angle structures on the same ideal structure , then the obstruction for one such structure vanishes if and only if the obstruction vanishes for any other one .",
    "note that it may be interesting to have a more direct understanding of why this is true , rather than just through the general results above that all such structures lie on the boundary of the same angle space , if and only if any one such structure has vanishing obstruction .",
    "if @xmath0 has a taut ideal triangulation @xmath10 , then so does @xmath266 for at least @xmath267 of the possible choices of a single @xmath268 pachner move , to change @xmath10 to @xmath266 . note that if two tetrahedra @xmath224 in @xmath10 are chosen with a common face , then so long as the @xmath46 angles at the edges of the two tetrahedra do not occur at the same edge of the common face , then there is an easy way of putting the ` same ' taut structure on @xmath266 as on @xmath10 .      with the same setup as for observation 3",
    ", there is an obstruction to deform the taut structure on @xmath10 to an angle structure if and only if there is a similar obstruction for @xmath266 .",
    "the proof is by enumerating cases and we will omit it .",
    "one would like to see how the obstruction to an angle structure changes , in passing between the standard two tetrahedra triangulation of the figure-@xmath269 knot space and the simple four tetrahedra example 1 above , by @xmath268 and @xmath270 pachner moves .",
    "the conclusion is this can only be done in a way that destroys the taut structure .",
    "so unfortunately this means that such moves will not give an easy way of keeping the taut structure but eliminating the obstruction .",
