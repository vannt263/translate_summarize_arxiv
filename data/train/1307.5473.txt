    "this paper is part of a larger project which develops various aspects of de rham and hodge cohomology theory for the natural class of ` iterated edge ' metrics on smoothly stratified spaces . in the course of this , we develop new analytic tools adapted to this singular geometry .",
    "+ stratified spaces arise naturally even when one is primarily interested in smooth objects . for example",
    ", whitney showed that if @xmath1 is the set of common zeros of a finite family of polynomials , then the singular part of @xmath2 @xmath3 is again algebraic and of dimension strictly less than that of @xmath4 this gives a natural filtration @xmath5 by algebraic subvarieties , or alternately a decomposition of @xmath1 into a union of analytic manifolds : @xmath6 where these different ` strata ' fit together in a precise way .",
    "there has been extensive investigation of this notion of stratified spaces .",
    "this class includes every analytic variety ( whitney ) , subanalytic set ( verdier ) , as well as the generalization of this last class to the class of definable sets in an arbitrary order - minimal structure ( loi ) .",
    "stratified spaces also include polyhedra , orbit spaces of many group actions on manifolds , and mapping cylinders of maps between manifolds .",
    "these spaces , the definition of which is recalled below , thus arise as ubiquitously as smooth manifolds .",
    "nonetheless , many basic aspects of geometric analysis on these spaces have not yet been developed in the literature , and this paper should be regarded as one step toward this goal .    a fundamental problem is to understand the de rham and hodge theory of these spaces .",
    "the seminal work on this was carried out by cheeger in the early 1980 s @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a compact stratified pseudomanifold and @xmath7 its top - dimensional regular part , and if @xmath8 is an ` iterated incomplete edge ' ( which we abbreviate as @xmath9 ) metric on @xmath7 , then there are two natural de rham complexes of @xmath0 forms : the first uses the minimal extension of the exterior derivative , with domain @xmath10 while the second uses the maximal extension of @xmath11 , with domain @xmath12 both complexes have finite dimensional cohomology and cheeger ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) showed that the latter is dual to the topological lower middle perversity intersection homology group @xmath13 of goresky - macpherson .",
    "it follows that the cohomology of the minimal domain @xmath0 complex is the dual of the upper middle perversity groups @xmath14 there is a special class of stratified spaces , satisfying the witt condition , on which these two cohomologies coincide .",
    "even more strongly , for suitably chosen metrics , the domains @xmath15 and @xmath16 coincide .    in a previous paper @xcite we have given a new treatment of the de rham / hodge theory of an @xmath9 metric on witt spaces ; this was then applied to the novikov conjecture on these spaces . in the present paper , we extend that theory to handle general non - witt spaces . for any metric on a non - witt space , @xmath17 , and one key part of our task is to define geometrically appropriate domains for the exterior derivative that lie between these two extremes .",
    "this is done following ideas of cheeger , published by him in the case of isolated conic singularities @xcite , and here extended to this general stratified setting .",
    "a space @xmath1 is non - witt if and only if there is a stratum @xmath18 with link at @xmath19 @xmath20 of even dimension such that @xmath21 if this is the case , these spaces form a vector bundle over @xmath18 with a natural flat connection . at every stratum where the witt condition fails ,",
    "we choose a smooth subbundle , with @xmath22 which is parallel with respect to the flat connection , and so that whenever two strata have intersecting closures , these choices are compatible . such a choice will be called a _ mezzoperversity .",
    "_    we work with ` suitably scaled , rigid ' @xmath9 metrics .",
    "the rigidity condition states that the metric has an ` exact conic ' structure on the conic fibers of the normal neighborhoods of each stratum . as shown in (",
    "* propositions 3.1 - 3.2 ) , there is no loss of generality in assuming this .",
    "the other condition of being suitably scaled is also easy to arrange , and requires simply that the restriction of the metric to the link of each of these conic fibrations be multiplied by a small enough factor so as to exclude spurious small eigenvalues of the induced operators on these links , and hence also excludes unnecessary indicial roots .",
    "we say more about this in  [ sec : indicialderham ] , see in particular lemma  [ lem : suitablescaling ] .",
    "let @xmath23 be a stratified pseudomanifold with a ( suitably scaled ) @xmath24-metric .",
    "each mezzoperversity @xmath25 on @xmath1 determines a domain for the exterior derivative and for the de rham operator @xmath26 we refer to this specification by saying that we are imposing _",
    "cheeger ideal boundary conditions . _",
    "the latter makes @xmath27 a self - adjoint operator with compact resolvent and induces a strong kodaira decomposition on differential forms , the former induces a fredholm complex whose cohomology @xmath28 satisfies a hodge theorem and is independent of the choice of @xmath9-metric .    in a companion @xcite to this paper , we show that this cohomology is invariant under stratified homotopy equivalences",
    ".    in proving this theorem , there are two main analytic difficulties to overcome .",
    "the first is the definition of the domains .",
    "if @xmath18 is a stratum of depth one , then its link @xmath29 is a closed manifold , and we establish below that any element @xmath30 has a distributional asymptotic expansion in terms of @xmath31 a ` boundary defining function ' for @xmath32 @xmath33 if @xmath34 is not even , or more generally , if the witt condition holds , then @xmath35 otherwise these forms constitute the cauchy data , on which the ideal boundary conditions are ( algebraic ) restrictions .",
    "we show that once we have imposed suitable boundary conditions on the first @xmath36 singular strata ( in terms of increasing depth ) , then there is an expansion of the form at the contiguous stratum of depth @xmath37 .    the second analytic difficulty , to the resolution of which the bulk of the paper is devoted , involves the construction of a parametrix for @xmath38 with cheeger ideal boundary conditions . on a space with a simple edge , i.e.  only one singular stratum",
    ", @xmath39 is an ` elliptic edge operator ' in the sense of @xcite , and there is a complete pseudodifferential theory to study it @xcite , at least when @xmath34 is even so that there is no indicial root exactly at the @xmath0 cutoff .",
    "the strategy here is to construct a parametrix for @xmath38 acting on the weighted space @xmath40 and then modify it to obtain a parametrix for @xmath41 with an error term taking values in @xmath42 using this parametrix , we show that the domain @xmath43 is compactly included in @xmath44    there is now a substantial amount of literature concerning related problems on spaces with simple edge singularities .",
    "we mention in particular , beyond @xcite and @xcite , the ongoing work of krainer and mendoza @xcite and the recent work of cheeger and dai @xcite .",
    "the oeuvre of schulze @xcite handles certain problems , though less general than considered here , for stratified spaces .",
    "+ every mezzoperversity @xmath45 has a dual mezzoperversity @xmath46 such that the intersection pairing of differential forms restricts to a non - degenerate pairing between the de rham cohomology of @xmath45 and that of @xmath47 a mezzoperversity which coincides with its dual is called a _ self - dual mezzoperversity_. it is not hard to see that there are topological obstructions , for example involving the signatures of the links , to the existence of a self - dual mezzoperversity on a stratified pseudomanifold .",
    "we shall call a compact stratified space which carries a self - dual mezzoperversity a _ cheeger space_.",
    "let @xmath23 be a stratified pseudomanifold with a ( suitably scaled ) @xmath24-metric . if @xmath25 is a self - dual mezzoperversity on @xmath2 then the domains @xmath48 are invariant under the action of the hodge star and the cohomology @xmath28 satisfies poincar duality .",
    "moreover , its signature is the index of the analytic signature operator , i.e.   the de rham operator @xmath38 with the involution induced by the hodge star , with boundary conditions and the domain induced by @xmath49 [ thm2 ]    in a companion paper @xcite , we apply the constructions of this paper to define higher signatures on a cheeger space and then prove the novikov conjecture for cheeger spaces which have fundamental groups satisfying the strong novikov conjecture .",
    "we also prove there that the signature of theorem  [ thm2 ] above is independent of the choice of self - dual mezzoperversity and is also a bordism invariant .",
    "these properties of the signature can also be deduced by comparing the analytic approach developed in the present paper with a purely topological definition of self - dual mezzoperversities and poincar duality developed earlier by banagl .",
    "the fact that these two approaches lead to equivalent signatures is proved in @xcite , joint with banagl .",
    "+ notice that at each stratum there are two canonical choices of mezzoperversity , the subbundles of @xmath50 of full rank or of rank zero .",
    "it follows from the work of cheeger , and is shown directly in @xcite , that these choices correspond to the upper - middle and lower - middle perversities of goresky - macpherson at this stratum .",
    "this companion paper also shows that any choice of self - dual sheaf in the sense of @xcite yields a mezzoperversity , satisfying the self duality studied in ",
    "[ sec : signlag ] .",
    "in particular , from @xcite we see that the reductive borel - serre compactification of a hilbert modular surface is an example of a space carrying interesting non - trivial mezzoperversities .",

    "in this section we give an overview of the types of operators and boundary conditions to which our methods apply . to help motivate and better",
    "explain all of this , we describe it in the now well - known simple edge setting , i.e.  where @xmath7 has only one singular stratum , then explain the analogous constructions in the next most complicated case , the depth two setting , and finally turn to spaces with singular strata of arbitrary depth .",
    "as we will see , much of the new complexity already occurs in the depth two case ; the extension to higher depth singularities involves an induction argument , but otherwise differs mostly in the notation .",
    "although we present all of this for a class of differential operators of arbitrary order satisfying a few structural hypotheses , our main interest is in the de rham and signature operators associated to an incomplete iterated edge metric , and so we use these operators as the key examples throughout , and describe the types of boundary problems in full detail only for these operators .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact stratified space , with singular strata @xmath51 ordered by increasing depth .",
    "we also denote by @xmath52 the open dense stratum of top dimension , the so - called regular part of @xmath1 ; the other strata @xmath53 are thus regarded as higher codimension boundaries of @xmath1 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a careful discussion of this class of spaces , and for the accompanying description of a resolution process which associates to any such stratified space @xmath1 a compact manifold with corners @xmath54 with iterated fibration structure on its boundary faces , obtained by blowing up the strata @xmath53 in order of decreasing depth .    for notational convenience , we assume for the rest of this paper that each stratum is connected , and even more strongly that there is a single maximal chain of strata @xmath55 where @xmath56 for all @xmath57",
    ". both of these assumptions are simple to remove and are adopted here to make the already complicated notation as simple as possible .    without yet specifying the specific degeneracies of the operators we shall consider later ( i.e.  the behavior of their coefficients near the singular strata ) , we first recall some generalities about closed extensions of unbounded operators on hilbert spaces .",
    "let @xmath58 be an elliptic operator on @xmath1 acting between sections of two bundles @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and fix a smooth measure on the regular part of @xmath1 and hermitian metrics on the fibres of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we may then regard @xmath58 as an unbounded operator acting on @xmath61 sections of @xmath59 .",
    "its graph , as a subspace of @xmath62 , is not closed .",
    "there are two canonical closed extensions of this subspace , both of which are graphs over dense domains @xmath63 .",
    "these are the minimal and maximal extensions : @xmath64 is the domain corresponding to the graph closure of @xmath58 on the core domain @xmath65 , while @xmath66 consists of all sections @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "the imposition of boundary condition consists of a choice of an intermediate domain @xmath69 lying between @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "the goal is to choose such a domain so that the corresponding opertor @xmath70 is not only closed but also fredholm .",
    "it is very difficult to analyze @xmath66 for operators on a stratified space directly .",
    "instead , we proceed inductively .",
    "if @xmath1 has depth @xmath36 , assume that ` good ' boundary conditions have already been chosen at the strata @xmath71 of depth less than @xmath36 .",
    "we study the ` partially minimal ' and ` partially maximal ' domains obtained by imposing these boundary conditions at the lower depth strata and applying the general definitions above at the stratum @xmath72 of depth @xmath36 .",
    "functions ( or sections ) in this partially maximal domain which satisfy @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 for @xmath75 ) have partial asymptotic expansions at @xmath72 , the coefficients of which can be regarded as the cauchy data of @xmath76 .",
    "a choice of good boundary conditions at @xmath72 consists of imposing appropriate conditions on these cauchy data ; in this paper we shall only impose local algebraic conditions on these cauchy data , but more generally one could impose nonlocal ( e.g.  pseudodifferential ) conditions . a refined analysis of more general boundary value problem of this type on spaces with simple edge singularities ( i.e.  on depth @xmath77 spaces )",
    "is carried out in @xcite , and in a series of articles by krainer and mendoza , @xcite .",
    "as noted earlier , we shall make a set of structural assumptions on the operator @xmath58 , and for the sake of exposition , we introduce these assumptions gradually , once we have provided motivation and suitable notation .",
    "our first of these is the    [ ass : localizable ] suppose that @xmath78 , i.e.  @xmath79 and @xmath80 . if @xmath81 is a point in a singular stratum of @xmath2 then there is a smooth function @xmath82 supported in a distinguished neighborhood of @xmath81 , with @xmath83 in a smaller neighborhood of @xmath84 such that @xmath85 [ assump1 ]    we define the notion of distinguished neighbourhoods later .",
    "we showed in @xcite that assumption  [ assump1 ] holds for the de rham operator .",
    "the same argument extends easily to show that it also holds for any dirac - type operator associated to an @xmath9 metric , as defined below .",
    "as promised , we now embark on a much more detailed discussion , initially on stratified spaces @xmath1 with only one singular stratum @xmath86 we call these simple edge spaces .",
    "one of the basic features of a stratified space is its thom - mather data ( see @xcite ) , which in this simple edge setting consists of a tubular neighborhood @xmath87 of @xmath18 in @xmath1 , equpped with a fibration over @xmath18 , the typical fiber of which is a cone over a smooth closed manifold @xmath29 .",
    "the ` resolution ' @xmath88 of @xmath1 is obtained by radially blowing up each of these conic fibres at its vertex ; thus @xmath88 is a smooth manifold with boundary , and the thom - mather data of @xmath1 is converted to a fibration of @xmath89 over @xmath18 with fiber @xmath90 @xmath91 there is a canonical identification of the interior of @xmath88 and @xmath52 , and we denote these common smooth spaces by @xmath7 : thus @xmath92 now choose any smooth boundary defining function @xmath93 for @xmath89 .",
    "a complete edge metric on @xmath7 is , by definition , a metric which near @xmath18 takes the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is metric on @xmath18 and @xmath96 a family of two - tensors that restricts to a metric on each fiber of @xmath97 we always assume that all of these terms are smooth for @xmath98 .",
    "we have buried some technicalities about the precise form of the asymptotics we allow , and shall return to these details when they become relevant below .",
    "complete edge metrics may be regarded as the basic structural regulators of the geometry of simple edge spaces , and many of the auxiliary quantities defined below are most naturally phrased in terms of these metrics .",
    "however , the focus of this paper is on _ incomplete _ edge metrics ; by definition @xmath8 is an incomplete edge metric if @xmath99 is a complete edge metric , see @xcite .",
    "the main reference for all of the definitions and constructions in this simple edge case is the paper @xcite .",
    "a vector field @xmath100 on @xmath88 has pointwise length which is uniformly bounded with respect to a complete edge metric if the restriction of @xmath100 to @xmath89 is tangent to the fibers of @xmath97 the space of all such @xmath100 is called the space of ` edge vector fields ' ; these are sections of the naturally defined ` edge tangent bundle ' , @xmath101 .",
    "this bundle naturally includes in the ordinary tangent bundle , @xmath102 , and this inclusion is an isomorphism over @xmath7 . over @xmath89 ,",
    "however , @xmath103 is a bundle of rank @xmath104    a differential operator @xmath58 on @xmath7 is an ` _ edge differential operator _ ' if it can be written as a locally finite sum of products of edge vector fields .",
    "this means , in local coordinates near the boundary , that it has the form @xmath105 for some @xmath106 . here , as before , @xmath93 is a boundary defining function , while @xmath107 are coordinates along @xmath32 and @xmath108 are coordinates along @xmath29 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath109 are assumed to be smooth functions in these variables ; if @xmath58 acts between sections of smooth bundles @xmath59 and @xmath60 over @xmath88 , then the @xmath109 are smooth sections of @xmath110 .",
    "the space of these operators of degree at most @xmath111 is denoted @xmath112 .",
    "there is an invariantly defined _ edge symbol _ of @xmath58 , @xmath113 which is naturally defined as a section of the pullback bundle @xmath114 over the edge cotangent bundle @xmath115 , which is the dual of @xmath116 .",
    "this edge symbol is part of a short exact sequence @xmath117 an edge differential operator @xmath58 is said to be ( edge-)elliptic if @xmath118 is invertible away from the zero section of @xmath119 . for brevity",
    ", we always say ellipticity rather than edge ellipticity ; the latter is always implied .",
    "next , the wedge operators ( also known as incomplete edge operators ) of order @xmath111 are defined as the class @xmath120 thus @xmath58 is in @xmath121 if , in the same type of local coordinates , @xmath122 we say that any such @xmath58 is elliptic if the associated edge operator @xmath123 is edge elliptic .    as we described in general earlier , if @xmath58 is a wedge operator , then @xmath124 and if @xmath7 is endowed with an ( incomplete ) edge metric and @xmath125 @xmath60 with hermitian metrics , there are two canonical closed extensions : the _ minimal extension _ , with domain @xmath126 where by definition , if @xmath127 then @xmath128 , and the _ maximal extension _ , with domain @xmath129 here @xmath130 is defined distributionally .    we can perform the same constructions for the associated edge operator @xmath131 , and if @xmath132 is elliptic then it is a consequence of the results in @xcite that @xmath133 this is the edge sobolev space of order @xmath111 .",
    "there is some relationship between these spaces and the domains of the wedge operator @xmath58 , namely @xmath134 but in general , these subspaces may all be different . to prove this chain of inclusions , note that clearly @xmath78 implies @xmath135 ;",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath136 then given any @xmath137 , we can find @xmath138 which converges to @xmath139 in @xmath140 and such that @xmath141 .",
    "this shows that @xmath142    a key difference from the closed ( nonsingular ) case is that an elliptic edge operator is not automatically fredholm , and one of the main points of the theory is to determine the extra conditions which need to be imposed to obtain a fredholm problem .",
    "these conditions are phrased in terms of a secondary model for @xmath58 beyond its principal symbol ; this is a family of operators known collectively as the ` normal operator , ' @xmath143 here @xmath144 is the inward - pointing half of the bundle @xmath145 and @xmath146 is the natural projection .",
    "the restriction to the fiber over a point @xmath147 is denoted @xmath148 where , in an abuse of notation , @xmath149 denotes the restriction of the bundle @xmath150 to @xmath151 and similarly @xmath152 in local coordinates , after identifying @xmath153 with @xmath154 @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath76 are coordinates on @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that an elliptic edge differential operator @xmath58 induces a fredholm operator on @xmath159 precisely when @xmath160 is invertible for every @xmath147 .",
    "the method for proving this result relies on a detailed analysis of the structure of the schwartz kernel of a parametrix for @xmath58 .",
    "this parametrix is constructed using both @xmath161 , via a modification of the standard symbol calculus parametrix method , and @xmath162 .",
    "the inverse of this family of model problems is integrated into the parametrix using a fundamentally geometric construction .",
    "specifically , we make the ansatz that the schwartz kernel of the parametrix lifts to a polyhomogeneous ( or at least conormal ) distribution on the ` edge double space ' , @xmath163.\\ ] ] this space is obtained from @xmath164 by radially blowing up the fiber diagonal of @xmath165 i.e. , replacing the fiber diagonal with its spherical inward - pointing normal bundle , see @xcite .",
    "the boundary hypersurface produced by this blow - up is called the _ edge front face _ and denoted @xmath166 a pseudodifferential edge operator @xmath167 , by definition , is a pseudodifferential operator on @xmath7 , the schwartz kernel @xmath168 of which is a distribution on @xmath164 , but which lifts to @xmath169 as a polyhomogeneous distribution .",
    "we typically place restrictions on , or at least keep track of , the exponents in the expansions of this lift of @xmath168 at the various boundary faces . in particular",
    ", this lift depends smoothly on the normal variable to @xmath170 , and its restriction to this face is , by definition , the normal operator of @xmath171 .",
    "the face @xmath170 is the total space of a fibration over @xmath18 with each fiber naturally identified with a projective compactification of @xmath172 , and @xmath171 should be regarded as a family of operators @xmath173 on this space .",
    "there are analogues of the various symbolic rules , including that @xmath174 specializing to the case where @xmath167 is an elliptic differential edge operator with invertible normal operator , one should therefore expect to construct a parametrix @xmath175 for @xmath167 by choosing @xmath175 so that @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "this is indeed the case , and is the basis for the parametrix construction in @xcite .",
    "thus pseudodifferential operators include both differential edge operators and parametrices of elliptic edge operators with invertible normal operator .",
    "we carry out a somewhat stripped down version of this construction here on stratified spaces , see  [ sec : invnormal ] .    in studying the normal operator of @xmath178 ,",
    "one uses properties of a simpler model operator .",

    "it turns out that only the subset @xmath202 of these asymptotic coefficients are relevant in the sense that if these _ leading coefficients _ vanish , then all coefficients @xmath203 with @xmath204 also vanish .",
    "it is also true that every leading coefficient @xmath202 is in the null space of @xmath205    the paper @xcite studies elliptic edge operators @xmath58 for which only the indicial roots @xmath206 lying in a particular strip @xmath207 ( where @xmath208 and @xmath209 are in a range determined by mapping properties of the normal operators @xmath210 ) may vary . the orders of the indicial roots are allowed to change , however . in the present paper we work with the intermediate    [ ass : cstindicialroots ] the set @xmath194 is independent of @xmath192 .",
    "this strip turns out to be the same as the one considered in @xcite .",
    "quite a lot can still be done even without assumption [ ass : cstindicialroots ] .",
    "for example , in a series of papers @xcite and further ongoing work , krainer and mendoza study elliptic edge operators assuming only that @xmath211 does not intersect the boundaries of this same strip , but allowing the indicial data in this range to vary .",

    "we show in lemma [ lem : suitablescaling ] that the de rham operator for a ( suitably scaled ) metric satisfies this assumption , and do not discuss the more general situation further .",
