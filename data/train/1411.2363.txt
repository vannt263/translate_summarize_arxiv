    "study of the space - time evolution and non - equilibrium properties of hot and dense matter produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , within the framework of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics , has gained widespread interest ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "hydrodynamics is an effective theory that describes the long - wavelength limit of the microscopic dynamics of a system . as a macroscopic theory which describes the space - time evolution of the energy - momentum tensor ,",
    "it is much less involved than microscopic descriptions such as kinetic theory . in order to study the hydrodynamic evolution of a system ,",
    "it is natural to first employ the equations of ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "however , ideal hydrodynamics is based on the unrealistic assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium which results in isentropic evolution .",
    "moreover , since the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle provides a lower bound on the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xcite , the dissipative effects can not be ignored .",
    "eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite were the first to formulate a relativistic theory of dissipative hydrodynamics , each with a different choice for the definition of hydrodynamic four - velocity .",
    "these theories are based on the assumption that the entropy four - current is linear in dissipative quantities and hence they are also known as first - order theories of dissipative fluids .",
    "the resulting equations for the dissipative quantities are essentially the relativistic analogue of the navier - stokes equations . however , the resulting equations of motion lead to parabolic differential equations which suffer from acausality and numerical instability . in order to rectify the undesirable features of first - order theories , extended theories of dissipative fluids",
    "were introduced by grad @xcite , mller @xcite and israel and stewart @xcite .",
    "these theories are based on the assumption that the entropy four - current contains terms quadratic in the dissipative fluxes and therefore are also known as second - order theories .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are hyperbolic in nature which preserves causality @xcite but may not guarantee stability .",
    "second - order israel - stewart ( is ) hydrodynamics has been quite successful in explaining a wide range of collective phenomena observed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . despite its successes ,",
    "the formulation of is theory is based on certain approximations and assumptions . for instance , the original is theory employs an arbitrary choice of the second moment of the boltzmann equation to obtain the equations of motion for the dissipative currents @xcite .",
    "another assumption inherent in is theory is the use of grad s 14-moment approximation for the non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "moreover , the is theory is a second - order theory which neglects contributions from higher - order terms in the entropy four - current .",
    "it is thus of interest to extend the second - order theory beyond its present scope and determine the associated transport coefficients for a hydrodynamic system .    in a non - equilibrium system , the presence of thermodynamic gradients results in thermodynamic forces which in turn gives rise to various transport phenomena .",
    "therefore transport coefficients such as viscosity , diffusivity and conductivity , are important to characterize the dynamics of a system .",
    "precise knowledge of these transport coefficients and associated length and time scales is necessary in comparing observables with theoretical predictions . in order to calculate these transport coefficients from the underlying kinetic theory , it is convenient to first determine the non - equilibrium single particle phase - space distribution function @xmath0 . when the system is close to local thermodynamic equilibrium , two most commonly used methods to determine the form of @xmath0 are ( 1 ) grad s 14-moment approximation @xcite and ( 2 ) the chapman - enskog expansion @xcite .",
    "although both methods involve expanding @xmath0 around its equilibrium value @xmath1 , in refs .  @xcite it was shown that the chapman - enskog method in the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) gives better agreement with microscopic boltzmann simulations as well as exact solutions of the rta boltzmann equation .",
    "consistent derivation of the form of the dissipative equations and accurate determination of the associated transport coefficients is still an active research area .    in this paper",
    ", we derive a new expression for the entropy four - current up to third - order in dissipative fluxes by employing the chapman - enskog expansion for the non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "although third - order expressions for entropy four - current have been derived using grad s 14-moment approximation , we present here , for the first time , the derivation using the chapman - enskog method .",
    "we show that unlike second - order and third - order results from grad s method , there is a non - vanishing entropy flux ( projection of the entropy four - current orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity ) in our expression for the entropy four - current .",
    "we demonstrate the significance of the present derivation in the special case of a system undergoing boost - invariant bjorken expansion . we show that compared to the grad s method , the chapman - enskog method is able to reproduce better the exact solution of boltzmann equation as well as the bamps results .",
    "evolution of the single particle phase - space distribution function , @xmath0 , is governed by the boltzmann equation . in the absence of collisions ,",
    "the particles propagate along geodesics which implies that @xmath0 does not change along geodesics .",
    "therefore for a geodesic parametrized by an affine parameter @xmath2 , we have @xmath3",
    ". when collisions are present , particles will no longer move along geodesics leading to a non - vanishing @xmath4 . hence ,",

    "as a final remark , we note that the relaxation - time approximation for the collision term in the boltzmann equation is based on the assumption that the collisions tend to restore the distribution function to its local equilibrium value exponentially .",
    "while it is true that the microscopic interactions of the constituent particles are not captured here , it is a reasonably good approximation to describe a system which is close to local thermodynamic equilibrium . indeed",
    ", it was shown that for a purely gluonic system at weak coupling and hadron gas with large momenta , the boltzmann equation in the relaxation - time approximation is a fairly accurate description @xcite .",
    "moreover , the experimentally observed and ideal hydrodynamic prediction of @xmath124 scaling of the femtoscopic radii was found to be violated by including viscous corrections to the distribution function using grad s method @xcite .",
    "it was shown later that this scaling can be restored by using the form of the non - equilibrium distribution function obtained using the chapman - enskog method .",
    "it has also been demonstrated recently that in contrast to the grad s approximation , the renormalization - group method leads to similar expressions for the transport coefficients as given by the chapman - enskog method @xcite .",
    "hence we can conclude that the boltzmann equation in the relaxation - time approximation can be applied quite successfully toward understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of the strongly interacting matter formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    at this juncture",
    ", we would like to clarify that we are using the exact solution of the boltzmann equation in relaxation - time approximation @xcite as a benchmark to compare different hydrodynamic formulations .",
    "we demand that the minimal requirement for a viable conformal hydrodynamic theory is that it should be able to describe the evolution of a viscous medium in this simple case .",
    "moreover , we have demonstrated that the chapman - enskog method leads to a fairly good agreement with the bamps results @xcite which employs a more realistic collision kernel .",
    "looking forward , it would be interesting to see if the third - order results derived herein could be extended to a system having bulk viscosity and dissipative charge current .",
    "furthermore , since a large bulk viscosity might lead to an early onset of cavitation , it would therefore be instructive to see how the third - order transport coefficients could influence cavitation @xcite .",
    "in addition , from a phenomenological perspective , it would be interesting to determine the impact of the third - order evolution equations in higher - dimensional simulations .",

    "<S> by employing a chapman - enskog like iterative solution of the boltzmann equation in relaxation - time approximation , we derive a new expression for the entropy four - current up to third order in gradient expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we show that unlike second - order and third - order entropy four - current obtained using grad s method , there is a non - vanishing entropy flux in the present third - order expression . </S>",
    "<S> we further quantify the effect of the higher - order entropy density in the case of boost - invariant one - dimensional longitudinal expansion of a system . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the results obtained using third - order evolution equation for shear stress tensor , derived by employing the method of chapman - enskog expansion , show better agreement with the exact solution of the boltzmann equation as well as with the parton cascade bamps , as compared to those obtained using the third - order equations from the method of grad s 14-moment approximation . </S>"
