    "<S> the function @xmath83 depends on applied bias voltage through electron filling numbers in the leads . </S>",

    "<S> the appearance of correction @xmath86 is crucial , because @xmath87 changes its sign and is equal to zero at some threshold value of applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> it was found out that function @xmath83 also changes its sign ( sometimes not once ) being positive at large bias . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the bias value at which @xmath83 goes from negative to positive values last time is very close to the threshold value for @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why we should retain all the corrections of the second order to polarization operators in order to get the reasonable accuracy of calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it was checked by direct numerical investigations , that for some parameters of the contact only vertex corrections ensure the validity of eq.([nneq2 ] ) in all bias range .    for large voltages , greater than the threshold value </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath49 becomes large negative value . </S>",
    "<S> so we get from eq.([nneq2])the following expression for phonon occupation numbers : @xmath88 for voltages beyond the threshold and if @xmath89 the value of @xmath87 can be estimated as : @xmath90 for resonant case the denominator @xmath91 is replaced by @xmath92 in this expression . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath93 in the range of large voltages can be estimated retaining only the following resonant term of the total expression : @xmath94 this gives for saturation regime : @xmath95    therefore maximum occupation numbers in saturation regime at high voltages are : @xmath96 since we consider the case of weak electron - phonon interaction , @xmath97 , phonon occupation numbers are large , which means strong phonon generation .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us return to the problem of self - consistency of the presented second order calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening of electron levels due to electron - phonon interaction is determined by @xmath98 ( [ sigma ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> our approximation remains valid until @xmath98 is less , than the broadening of electron levels @xmath99 due to the tunneling coupling . for large phonon occupation numbers </S>",
    "<S> the main term of @xmath100 is : @xmath101 thus @xmath71 is limited by inequality : @xmath102 from eq.([gph ] ) the limit of validity of our approximation is : @xmath103 this value of @xmath104 from eq.([nmax ] ) is just of the same order . </S>",
    "<S> so at large values of applied bias we , strictly speaking , work at the limit of applicability of suggested scheme but never go beyond this limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the phonon line width is determined by the imaginary part of the polarization operator @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> omitting second order corrections , maximum value of @xmath106 ( see ( [ pamax ] ) ) is much smaller than the phonon frequency @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> second order corrections to @xmath107 do not change substantially this value , even for large nonequilibrium phonon numbers . in accordance with eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gph],[nmax ] ) maximum possible changes of electron green functions are of the order of themselves . </S>",
    "<S> thus corrections to polarization operators can result only in some numerical coefficient of the order of unity . </S>",
    "<S> this means that even in the saturation regime with large nonequilibrium phonon numbers the width of the phonon line remains small .    </S>",

    "<S> first order corrections corresponding to the first diagram in fig.3 with equilibrium phonon green function were calculated in the previous paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we take into account nonequilibrium changes of the phonon occupation numbers , we should consider four diagrams , depicted in fig.3 .        </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to remark that just these types of the electron self - energy corrections are consistent with phonon polarization operators , depicted in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the both sets of diagrams originate from the the same generating functional .    </S>",
    "<S> this self - consistency means , that corresponding ward identities are satisfied , and charge conservation in the tunneling processes is automatically fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> note that all electron green functions in all polarization operators and self - energy parts are calculated omitting the electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> an attempt to use self - consistent born approximation for the electron gf leads to violation of charge conservation in this problem and artificial symmetrization is needed to restore current continuity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we can neglect the contribution from the three last diagrams in fig.3 . in the following cases :    \\a ) </S>",
    "<S> if there is no inverse electron population due to the tunneling current , then phonon numbers are small , and second order diagrams have small parameter @xmath111 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\b ) if inverse population appears , but phonon frequency is far from the resonance between electron levels : @xmath112 . then second order diagrams have small parameter @xmath113 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> phonon numbers are large @xmath114 , so the first correction with full phonon function strongly differs from equilibrium result .    </S>",
    "<S> c)if inverse population appears and phonon frequency is almost in resonance with electron transition energy @xmath112 , then we can restrict ourself to the first term only near the threshold voltage , until phonon numbers are not too large . </S>",
    "<S> for high voltages in saturation regime in this case we can not use perturbation theory , because corrections to electron green functions become of the order of zero order green function . </S>",
    "<S> we should sum up not only second order diagrams depicted in fig.3 , but all the higher order terms as well .    </S>",
    "<S> so we calculate the corrections to the tunneling current using only the first term in fig.3 ( one - loop diagram ) but with full nonequilibrium phonon green function , taking into account that in resonant case c ) it makes sense not far beyond the threshold of strong generation .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the tunneling current calculated in @xcite there exists a correction to eq . </S>",
