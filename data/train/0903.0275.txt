    "during the past several years , the observed discrepancies between the experimental measurements and the theoretical predications within the standard model  ( sm ) for several observables in @xmath15 decays , the so - called  @xmath11 puzzle \"  @xcite , have attracted much attention .",
    "extensive investigations both within the sm  @xcite , as well as with various specific new physics  ( np ) scenarios  @xcite , have been performed .",
    "averaging the recent experimental data from babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and cdf  @xcite , the heavy flavor averaging group  ( hfag ) gives the following up - to - date rsults  @xcite @xmath16 from which the difference between direct cp violations in the charged and the neutral modes @xmath17 is now established at about @xmath18 level .    theoretically , it is generally expected that within the sm , these two cp asymmetries @xmath19 and @xmath20 should be approximately equal . for example , based on the qcd factorization approach  ( qcdf )  @xcite , the recent theoretical predictions with two different schemes for the end - point divergence are @xmath21 here , the scheme  i is the way to parameterize the end - point divergence appearing in hard - spectator and annihilation corrections , by complex parameters @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and unrestricted @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the scheme  ii , as an alternative to the first one , is the way to quote the infrared finite gluon propagator to regulate the divergence .",
    "it is interesting to note that an infrared finite behavior of gluon propagator are not only obtained by solving the well - known schwinger - dyson equation  @xcite , but also supported by recent lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , both of these two schemes suffer the mismatch of @xmath25 given by eq .",
    "( [ cpdiff ] ) .",
    "furthermore , within the framework of perturbative qcd approach  ( pqcd )  @xcite , and the soft - collinear effective theory  ( scet )  @xcite , the theoretical predictions read @xmath26 obviously , the present theoretical estimations within the sm are not consistent with the established @xmath25",
    ". the mismatch might be due to our current limited understanding of the strong dynamics involved in hadronic b decays , but equally also to possible np effects  @xcite .    in",
    "some well - motivated extensions of the sm , additional @xmath27 gauge symmetries and associated @xmath5 gauge boson could arise .",
    "searching for the extra @xmath5 boson is an important mission in the experimental programs of tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "performing the constraints on the new @xmath5 couplings through low - energy physics , on the other hand , is very imporatnt for the direct searches and understanding its phenomenology .",
    "theoretically , the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) is forbidden at tree level in the sm .",
    "one of the simple extensions is the family nonuniversal @xmath5 model , which could be naturally derived in certain string constructions@xcite , @xmath28 models@xcite and so on .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nonuniversal @xmath5 couplings could lead to fcnc and new cp - violating effect  @xcite , which possibly provide a solution to the afore mentioned  @xmath11 puzzle \" . with some simplifications of the nonuniversal @xmath5 model and neglecting the color - suppressed electroweak  ( ew ) penguins and the annihilation amplitudes , ref .",
    "@xcite gets four possible solutions @xmath29 however , the corresponding prediction @xmath30  @xcite of solution @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ barger ] ) is obviously inconsistent with the up - to - date experimental data @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the annihilation amplitudes , which could generate some strong - interaction phases , are important for predicting cp violations .    based on the above observations , in this paper we shall adopt the qcdf approach and reevaluate the effects of the nonuniversal @xmath5 model on these decay modes with the updated experimental data . furthermore , since the @xmath34 and @xmath4 decays also involve the same quark level @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) transition , it is necessary to take into account these decay modes .",
    "in section  2 , we provide a quick survey of @xmath2 , @xmath37 and @xmath4 decays in the sm within the qcdf formalism ; our numerical results , with two different schemes for the end - point divergence , are also presented . in section  3 , after reviewing the nonuniversal @xmath5 model briefly , we present our analyses and numerical results in detail .",
    "section  4 contains our conclusions .",
    "appendix  a recapitulates the decay amplitudes for the twelve decay modes within the sm  @xcite .",
    "appendix  b contains the formulas for hard - spectator and annihilation amplitudes with the infrared finite gluon propagator  @xcite .",
    "all the theoretical input parameters are summarized in appendix  c.",
    "in the sm , the effective hamiltonian responsible for @xmath38 transitions is given as  @xcite @xmath39 +   { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40  ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are products of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) matrix elements  @xcite , @xmath44 the wilson coefficients , and @xmath45 the relevant four - quark operators whose explicit forms could be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the qcdf approach has been employed extensively to study the hadronic b - meson decays .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays have been studied comprehensively within the sm in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the relevant decay amplitudes within this formalism are shown in appendix a. it is also noted that the framework contains estimates of the hard - spectator and annihilation corrections .",
    "even though they are power - suppressed , their strength and associated strong - interaction phase are numerically important to evaluate the branching ratio and the cp asymmetry . however , unfortunately , the end - point singularities appear in twist-3 spectator and annihilation amplitudes .",
    "so , how to regulate the end - point divergence becomes important and necessary within this formalism .",
    "here we shall adopt the following two schemes :      as the most popular way , the end - point divergent integrals are treated as signs of infrared sensitive contributions and phenomenologically parameterized by  @xcite @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 unrestricted .",
    "@xmath50 is treated in the same manner .",
    "the different choices of @xmath51 and @xmath49 correspond to different scenarios as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and s4 is mentioned as the most favorable one .",
    "it presents the moderate value of nonuniversal annihilation phase @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "conservatively , in our calculations we quote @xmath55 as their theoretical uncertainties . taking @xmath56 and @xmath57 universal for all decay processes belonging to the same modes  ( pp , pv or vp ) , we present our numerical results of branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries for @xmath58 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays in the third column of tables  [ tab_br ] and [ tab_cp ] , respectively .    as is known , the mixing - induced cp asymmetry @xmath59 is well suited for testing the sm and searching for new physics effects .",
    "for example , the investigation of mixing - induced cp asymmetries in penguin dominated @xmath60 and @xmath61 decay modes has attracted much attention recently  @xcite . after neglecting the @xmath62 mixing effect",
    ", the mixing - induced asymmetry could be written as @xmath63 with @xmath64\\}\\bar{a}_f / a_f$ ] in our phase convention .",
    "our numerical predictions are listed in table  [ tab_mixcp ] , which agree with the measurements within large experimental errors .      in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we have thoroughly studied the end - point divergence with an infrared finite dynamical gluon propagator . it is interesting to note that recent theoretical and phenomenological studies are now accumulating supports for a softer infrared behavior of the gluon propagator  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the infrared finite dynamical gluon propagator , which is shown to be not divergent as fast as @xmath65 , has been successfully applied to the hadronic b - meson decays  @xcite . in our evaluations , we shall quote the gluon propagator derived by cornwall ( in minkowski space )  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the gluon momentum . the corresponding strong",
    "coupling constant reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the first coefficient of the beta function , with @xmath70 being the number of active quark flavors .",
    "the dynamical gluon mass square @xmath71 is obtained as  @xcite @xmath72^{-\\frac{12}{11 } } , \\label{mg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the effective gluon mass and @xmath74 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we present our suggestion , @xmath75 , which is a reasonable choice so that most of the observables ( except for @xmath76 ) are in good agreement with the experimental data . in this way , we find that the hard - spectator scattering contributions are real , and the annihilation contributions are complex with a large imaginary part  @xcite . our numerical predictions for branching",
    "ratios , direct cp asymmetries and mixing - induced cp asymmetries are listed in the fourth column of tables  [ tab_br ] , [ tab_cp ] and [ tab_mixcp ] , respectively .    although numerically these two schemes have some differences , both of their predictions are consistent with most of the experimental data within errors . however , as expected in the sm , we again find that @xmath77 , are very close to @xmath78 in the first  ( second ) scheme .",
    "so , it is still hard to accommodate the measured large difference @xmath25 in the sm within the qcdf formalism , irrespective of adopting which scheme . in the following ,",
    "we pursue possible solutions to this problem with a family nonuniversal @xmath5 model  @xcite .",
    "a possible heavy @xmath5 boson is predicted in many extensions of the sm , such as grand unified theories , superstring theories , and theories with large extra dimensions .",
    "the simplest way to extend the sm gauge structure is to include a new @xmath79 gauge group .",
    "a family nonuniversal @xmath5 model can lead to fcnc processes even at tree level due to the non - diagonal chiral coupling matrix .",
    "the formalism of the model has been detailed in ref .",
    "the relevant studies in the context of b physics have also been extensively performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    after neglecting the @xmath80 mixing with small mixing angle @xmath81  @xcite , and taking all the fields being the physical eigenstates ,",
    "the @xmath5 part of the neutral - current lagrangian can be written as  @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the gauge coupling constant of extra @xmath84 group at the ew @xmath85 scale .",

    "it is noted that the forms of the above operators already exist in the sm . as a result ,",
    "( [ heffz1 ] ) can be modified as @xmath94 where @xmath95 are the effective operators in the sm , and @xmath96 the modifications to the corresponding sm wilson coefficients caused by @xmath5 boson , which are expressed as @xmath97 in terms of the model parameters at the @xmath85 scale .",
    "generally , the diagonal elements of the effective coupling matrices @xmath98 are real as a result of the hermiticity of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , the off - diagonal ones of @xmath99 can contain a new weak phase @xmath100 .",
    "then , conveniently we can represent @xmath96 as @xmath101 where the real np parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath100 are defined , respectively , as @xmath104\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    0.7pt 0.04 in    .the wilson coefficients @xmath105 within the sm and with the contribution from @xmath5 boson included in ndr scheme at the scale @xmath106 and @xmath107 .

    "[ acppik ]  ( c ) , we find that the variation trends of @xmath110 and @xmath111 are always the same , indicating that the @xmath5 contributions in this case could not give a solution to the observed `` @xmath11 puzzle '' directly , as well as the unmatched @xmath112 induced by @xmath6 . however , it is interesting to note that , with @xmath113 , both @xmath110 and @xmath111 could be enhanced simultaneously , which may relax the constraints on @xmath7 . as mentioned in case ii ,",
    "a negative @xmath7 is favored by the `` @xmath11 puzzle '' and can moderate the problem of @xmath114 induced by @xmath6 .",
    "so , the parameter @xmath14 may play an important role .    with @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 as constraints , the allowed regions for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath14 and @xmath100 are shown in figs .",

    "then , there are five arbitrary np parameters . as in case iii , we take @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath124 as constraints and present the predictions for the other observables .    the allowed regions for @xmath103 , @xmath102 and @xmath100 are shown in fig",
