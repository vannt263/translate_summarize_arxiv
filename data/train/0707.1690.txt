    "the intrinsic galaxy alignment refers to a cosmic phenomenon that the orientations of the galaxy spin axes ( or galaxy ellipticities ) are not random but locally aligned between neighbors due to the spatial correlations of the initial tidal field .",
    "the topic of the intrinsic galaxy alignments has recently drawn considerable attention in the field of the large - scale structure for three reasons .",
    "firstly , since it is believed to be induced by the spatial correlations of the initial tidal field , it will be possible in principle by measuring the galaxy intrinsic alignments to reconstruct the initial density field on galactic scales @xcite .    secondly , the initial tidal correlations are also responsible for the web - like distribution of the large scale structures @xcite .",
    "thus , the galaxy intrinsic alignments will be useful to characterize and quantify the influence of the large - scale structures on the orientations of the galaxies distributed in a cosmic web @xcite .",
    "thirdly and most importantly , the galaxy intrinsic alignments could cause non - negligible contamination on weak lensing signals .",
    "plenty of efforts have been made so far to distinguish and separate the intrinsic contaminations from the galaxy extrinsic alignments caused by the weak gravitational lensing effect @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , it is of fundamental importance to predict the degree of galaxy intrinsic alignments with a valid theory and measure quantitatively their signals in practice .",
    "in fact , @xcite have provided an analytic model for the intrinsic galaxy spin alignments in the frame of the linear tidal torque theory @xcite . according to their model , the galaxy intrinsic alignments",
    "can be expressed in terms of a quadratic scaling of the density correlation function and thus are expected to exist only at small distances of order of a few mpc .",
    "a crucial implication of their analytic model is that due to the quadratic scaling nature of the galaxy intrinsic alignments the cross - correlations between the gravitational lensing shears from large scale density field and the galaxy intrinsic alignments with local tidal shears will be zero .",
    "@xcite tested their analytic predictions against low - redshift samples of spiral galaxies and found that the observed signals are consistent with the analytic predictions . yet , their detections suffered from poor - number statistics and thus were still tentative .",
    "later , several other authors have confirmed the existence of galaxy intrinsic alignments at small scales either in numerical simulations or in low - redshift observational surveys @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite has pointed out that it might be invalid to describe the galaxy intrinsic alignments on large scales as a quadratic function of the density correlation .",
    "their logic is as follows : since the quadratic scaling is based on the linear tidal torque theory which adopts a somewhat oversimplified assumption that the tidal field is gaussian in the subsequent evolutionary stages , it should not be a good approximation to describe the galaxy intrinsic alignments on large scales . in reality",
    ", the density fluctuations will develop non - gaussianity via gravity which would in turn lead to non - negligible contributions of the nonlinear - order of the tidal tensors to the generation of the galaxy angular momentum . due to this nonlinear effect on the galaxy angular momentum ,",
    "their intrinsic spin alignments should be better approximated as linear scaling with the density correlation function . because the linear scaling of the density correlation drops much slowly than the quadratic scaling",
    ", the intrinsic spin alignments would not be completely negligible even on large scales .",
    "if their claims turn out to be true , then it will have a significant impact not only on the weak lensing analysis but also on our fundamental understanding of the evolution of the tidal alignments .    in the light of their claims ,",
    "the following questions naturally arise ; does the nonlinear tidal effect on the galaxy intrinsic alignments really exist to a non negligible degree ?",
    "if so , at what epochs and on which scales does its contribution begin to be significant ? does it depend on the intrinsic properties of the galaxies or dark halos ?",
    "our goal here is to answer the above questions using both analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows :  2 , we overview briefly the previous analytic model for the galaxy spin - spin alignments based on the linear tidal torque theory and propose a new model to account for the nonlinear tidal effect .",
    " 3 , we report a detection of the signals of the nonlinear tidal effect on the intrinsic spin alignments of dark matter halos simulated in n - body experiments and show how the signals depend on redshift , scale , and the halo intrinsic property .",
    " 4 , we summarize our results and discuss the implications of our work on the weak lensing effect .",
    "the linear tidal torque theory explains that unless a proto - halo has a perfectly spherical shape , it can acquire spin angular momentum at first order through its tidal interaction with the surrounding matter @xcite .",
    "the main prediction of the linear tidal torque theory is that the proto - halo angular momentum vector , ( @xmath4 ) , is proportional to the anti - symmetric product of the two tensors , the inertial momentum tensor @xmath5 and the local tidal shear tensor , @xmath6 , as @xmath7 here the defintions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lagrangian position of the particles that reside in the proto - halo regions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the lagrangian volume and the density of the proto - halo region , respectively , and @xmath14 is the velocity perturbation potential .    given the property of the perfectly anti - symmetric tensor @xmath15 in equation ( [ eqn : ang ] ) , an additional condition has to be satisfied for the first - order generation of the proto - halo angular momentum : the principal axes of @xmath8 and @xmath9 have to be misaligned with each other @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a crucial implication of equation ( [ eqn : ang ] ) is that if this additional condition is satisfied and thus the angular momentum of a proto - halo is generated at first order , then the direction of the proto - halo angular momentum is not random but preferentially aligned with the principal axes of the local tidal tensor @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments have revealed that the principal axes of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are correlated strongly but not perfectly @xcite , which indicates that the first - order generation of the proto - halo angular momentum is not so efficient and the degree of the alignments between the proto - halo spin directions and the principal axes of the local tidal shear tensors would not be so high .    motivated by this numerical clue , @xcite suggested the following quadratic formula to quantify the expected degree of the alignments between the halo spins and the local tidal shears , generalizing the linear tidal torque theory : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the unit spin vector of a halo , @xmath18 is the unit traceless tidal tensor smoothed on the halo mass scale , and @xmath19 is a correlation parameter in the range of @xmath20 $ ] which measures the strength of the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth recalling the fact that the ensemble average @xmath21 in the left hand side of equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) is obtained by taking the average of @xmath22 from the sample halos having all different mass , while the tidal shear field in the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) is smoothed on the single mass scale which amounts to the mean halo mass ( i.e. , the mean value of the mass of the sample halos).@xcite derived equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) empirically , relating the angular momenta of the halos with different mass to the tidal shear field smoothed on the mean halo mass .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath19 in equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) which characterizes equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) is introduced to take into account strong correlations between @xmath5 and @xmath6 and any modification in the subsequent evolution after the moment of the turn - around .",
    "the two extreme cases of @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent no correlation and maximum correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "it is expected that the true value of @xmath19 would be between these two extremes .",
    "the linear tidal torque theory itself can not make any prediction on the value of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the true value of this free parameter @xmath19 has to be determined empirically .",
    "so far , several attempts have been made to measure the value of @xmath19 either from numerical simulations or from observations @xcite .",
    "although no general consensus has been reached on the true value of @xmath19 , most of the numerical and observational evidences indicated that the true value of @xmath19 deviates from zero .      a difficulty in constraining the value of @xmath19 lies in the fact that it is hard to measure the principal axes of the linear tidal field in real space . an alternative approach to the true value of @xmath19 is to measure the intrinsic spin - spin correlations of dark halos @xcite .",
    "the local alignments between the halo spin vectors and the tidal shear tensors will lead to spatial spin alignments between the neighbor halos . using equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) , @xcite derived the following analytic model for the halo spin - spin correlations : @xmath25 here , the constant @xmath26 represents the value of @xmath27 for the case of no alignment , and @xmath28 is the linear two - point correlation function defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dimensionless power spectrum and @xmath31 is the top - hat spherical filter of scale radius , @xmath32 , which is related to the halo mass scale @xmath33 as @xmath34^{1/3}$ ] with the mean density @xmath35 .",
    "note that equation ( [ eqn:1st ] ) is proportional to the square of the two point density correlation @xmath36 , which means that the halo spin - spin correlations would decrease very rapidly .",
    "for instance , on a galactic scale ( @xmath37mpc ) , it is expected that the halo spin - spin correlations exist only at distances of order of a few mpcs and effectively vanishes at larger distances .    since the tidal field on different scales",
    "are cross - correlated , equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) leads to the existence of the cross - correlations of the spin axes of halos on different mass scales . in accordance with equation ( [ eqn:1st ] ) the halo spin cross - correlations on different scales ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) are modeled as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the density cross - correlation function defined as @xmath42 it is worth mentioning that the value of @xmath19 for the cross correlation @xmath43 would not be same as its value for the auto - correlation @xmath44 in equation ( [ eqn:1st ] ) due to the difference in the smoothing scale for the tidal field . note that equation ( [ eqn : crr ] ) is a modified version of equation ( [ eqn:1st ] ) , both of which are based on equation ( [ eqn : stc ] ) .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath19 in equation ( [ eqn:1st ] ) represents the spin - spin correlations caused by the spatial correlations of the tidal fields smoothed on the same scale ( one mean halo mass scale , @xmath32 ) . while the correlation parameter @xmath19 in equation ( 6 ) represents the spin - spin correlations caused by the spatial correlations of the tidal fields on two different scales ( two mean halo mass scales , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "since the spatial correlations of the two tidal fields smoothed on two different scales , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( say , @xmath45 ) , are lower than the case that the two tidal fields are smoothed on the same scale of @xmath39 and higher than the case that they are smoothed on the same scale of @xmath38 , it is naturally expected that the value of @xmath19 for the cross - correlation @xmath43 should be different from that for the correlation @xmath44 .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , it was @xcite who first pointed out that equation ( [ eqn:1st ] ) is valid only if the gravitational tidal field is gaussian .",
    "they argued that the non - gaussianity in the tidal field should not be negligible in the nonlinear regime and suggested that the halo spin - spin alignments should be better described as a linear scaling with the density correlation function on sufficiently large scales .",
    "inspired by the work of @xcite , here we suggest a new formula to model the halo spin - spin correlations : @xmath46 where a nonlinear correlation parameter @xmath47 is introduced to measure the strength of the nonlinear tidal effect on the halo spin - spin correlations . in this model",
    "the linear correlation parameter is notated as @xmath48 since its value could be different between the two cases that the nonlinear effect is ignored as in equation ( [ eqn:1st ] ) and taken into account as in ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) implies that if the nonlinear contribution exists , then the halo spin - spin correlations must exist on larger scale than predicted by the linear model ( eq.[[eqn:1st ] ] ) since it scales linearly with the density correlation function in the nonlinear model .",
    "that is , the nonlinear tidal effect would generate large - scale correlations of the halo spin axes .",
    "of course , the values of the nonlinear correlation parameter @xmath47 as well as the linear correlation parameter have to be determined empirically .    the cross - correlation",
    ", @xmath43 can be also modeled in accordance with ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) as @xmath49 it is worth mentioning that the value of @xmath50 for the cross correlation @xmath43 would not be necessarily lower than its value for the auto - correlation @xmath44 in equation ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) , unlike the case of the linear tidal torque model in  2.2 . in the nonlinear regime where the non - gaussianity in the density field grows ,",
    "the occurrence of the halo merging is quite frequent .",
    "this occurrence of the halo merging plays a role of transferring the orbital angular momentum generated by the external tidal field into the spin angular momentum of a merged halo .",
    "in other words , the orbital angular momentum of a system composed of small individual halos become the spin angular momentum of a large halo formed through merging of the small halos .",
    "given that the orbital angular momentum of the system before merging is generated by the external tidal field on larger scale @xcite , the transfer of the orbital angular momentum into the spin angular momentum creates cross - correlations of the tidal fields between different scales , which in turn generates large - scale cross - correlations @xmath51 in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we use the halo catalogs from the millennium run simulation of @xmath52 dark matter particles for a @xmath53cdm universe with the cosmological parameters given as @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the simulation was performed in a periodic box of linear size of @xmath58mpc to follow the evolution of all particles from @xmath59 to @xmath3 , each of which has a mass of @xmath60 .",
    "we analyze the halo catalogs at four different redshifts @xmath3 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath1 which contain information on the halo mass , comoving position , comoving peculiar velocity and the spin vector . at each redshift , we restrict our attention only to those halos which have more than @xmath63 particles for better accuracy in the measurement of the halo spin vector",
    ". it amounts to selecting only halos which are more massive than @xmath64 .",
    "basically , we measure the spatial correlations of the spin axes between neighbor halos as a function of separation distance and investigate how the correlation strength changes with redshift ( z ) , halo mass ( @xmath33 ) , velocity ( @xmath65 ) and specific angular momentum ( @xmath66 , angular momentum per mass ) .",
    "then , we compare the numerical results with the linear and the nonlinear analytic models described in  2 to determine the best - fit values of the correlation parameters , @xmath19 , @xmath67 , and @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ fig : z ] plots the halo spin - spin correlation function @xmath44 at @xmath3,@xmath61,@xmath62 and @xmath1 in the top - left , top - right , bottom - left , and bottom - right panel , respectively . in each panel ,",
    "the solid dots correspond to the numerical results from the millennium data while the solid and the dashed lines represent the nonlinear model ( eq.[[eqn:2nd ] ] ) and the linear model ( eq.[[eqn:1st ] ] ) , respectively .",
    "the case of no alignment is also shown as a dotted line in each panel for comparison .    the errors of the numerical results are calculated as one standard deviation for the case of no alignment .",
    "basically , it is computed by the formula of @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of halos belonging to each bin @xcite .",
    "note that the sizes of the vertical errors in figure [ fig : z ] depend on the value of @xmath69 which in turn depends on the bin size of the spatial separation @xmath70 .",
    "here we choose the bin size of @xmath70 as @xmath71mpc for all plots .",
    "we have tested whether or not the final results depend on the bin size of @xmath70 and confirmed the robustness of the final results .    for the analytic models ,",
    "the correlation parameters are determined through fitting to the numerical results by means of the @xmath72-minimization . for the evaluation of the analytic models , we use the formula for the linear power spectrum given by @xcite using the same values of the cosmological parameters that are used for the millennium run simulations and the shape parameter @xmath73 ( private communication with v. springel ) .",

    ", the mean mass @xmath75 for each bin is used to find the lagrangian smoothing scale , @xmath32 which has to be implemented into the analytic models ( eqs.[eqn:1st ] -[eqn:2nd ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : z ] , we detect clear signals of the halo spin - spin alignments within a few @xmath78mpc distances at all four redshifts .",
    "note , however , a conspicuous difference between the results at low redshifts ( @xmath3 and @xmath61 ) and at higher redshifts ( @xmath79 and @xmath1 ) . at @xmath79 and @xmath1",
    ", the correlation signals rapidly decrease with distance and disappear at distances around @xmath2mpc .",

    "whereas , at @xmath3 and @xmath61 the correlation signals decrease rather slowly , still existent to a nennegligible level at large separations beyond @xmath2mpc .",
    "thus , at low redshifts the nonlinear model ( solid line ) fits the numerical data much better than the linear model , predicting the existence of the large - scale correlations .",
    "this phenomena can be quantified in terms of the bestfit - values of the correlation parameters listed in table [ tab : z ] . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath47 is effectively zero within one standard deviation ( @xmath80 ) while the best - fit value of @xmath48 is higher than @xmath81 ( not marginalized level ) .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath3 the value of @xmath47 deviates from zero as significantly as @xmath82 while the value of @xmath48 decreases significantly to a @xmath83 level .",

    "figure [ fig : cz ] plots the @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 contours for @xmath48 and @xmath47 at @xmath77 , showing the degeneracy in putting the constraints on the two parameters .",
    "as can be seen , at @xmath3 and @xmath61 , the values of @xmath47 deviate from zero at higher than @xmath86 level .",
    "our numerical detection implies that the linear model for the halo spin - spin correlations ( eq.[[eqn:1st ] ] ) works well at @xmath87 but the nonlinear effect indeed dominates at low redshifts ( @xmath88 ) , producing large - scale correlations of the halo spins , which can be well described by our nonlinear model ( eq.[[eqn:2nd ] ) .",
    "we define the magnitude of the rescaled specific angular momentum ( angular momentum per unit mass ) as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the halo angular momentum magnitude and the halo mass in unit of @xmath92 , respectively . to determine quantitatively how the halo spin - spin correlation changes with @xmath66",
    ", we classify the halos at @xmath3 into four logarithmic bins of @xmath66 and measure the correlations separately for each bin .",
    "figure [ fig : a ] plots @xmath44 at four logarithmic bins of @xmath66 in the top - left , top - right , bottom - left , and bottom - right panels , respectively . table [ tab : a ] also lists the number of halos , the mean mass , the best - fit values of @xmath19 , @xmath48 and @xmath47 for each bin , and figure [ fig : ca ] plots the @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 contours for @xmath48 and@xmath47 at the four bins .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : a ] , in the bins of low-@xmath66 halos ( top two panels ) , the correlations are rather weak and rapidly diminish to zero at separations greater than a few @xmath78mpc .",
    "thus , for this case the linear model with the single parameter @xmath19 fits the data pretty well .",
    "in other words , for the spin - spin correlations of low-@xmath66 halos , the values of @xmath47 are effectively zero as shown in table [ tab : a ] .",
    "while in the bins of high-@xmath66 halos , the correlations are stronger , still existent even at separations as large as @xmath2mpc . therefore for the spin - spin correlations of high-@xmath66 halos , the nonlinear model with non - zero value of @xmath47 fits the data much better than the linear model .",
    "note that for the case of highest-@xmath66 halos , the value of @xmath47 is approximately @xmath93 , which is five times greater than the average value of @xmath94 at @xmath3 .",
    "this phenomena that the halos with higher specific angular momentum tend to have stronger non - linear ( and linear ) spin - spin correlations may be explained as follows .",
    "if a halo is located in a region where the effect of the tidal field is very strong , then the halo will possess high specific angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , its spin direction will be strongly correlated with that of its neighbors since the strong effect of the tidal field tends to diminish any randomization of the spin orientations that can occur in the subsequent stages.therefore , those halos which have higher specific angular momentum are likely to show strong spin - spin correlations under the strong effect of the tidal field .",
    "we have also explored whether this phenomena occur at higher redshifts @xmath95,@xmath62 and @xmath1 and found that this is still the case .",
    "the halos at @xmath3 are classified into four bins according to the value of the rescaled mass @xmath91 and their spin - spin alignments are measured separately for each bin .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : m ] , in the third bin which includes the galactic halos with mass of order of @xmath96 ( bottom - left panel ) , the correlation signal is strongest , existent at separations as large as @xmath2mpc . for this bin , the nonlinear model with nonzero value of @xmath47",
    "gives a better fit the numerical results than the linear with model single parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath47 deviates from zero by a factor of @xmath83 as shown in table [ tab : m ] . whereas in the first and the fourth bins which include dwarf halos and galaxy - group halos , respectively , the signals are rather weak and the correlations disappear at large distances . for these bins , the linear model for itself",
    "fits the numerical data quite well and the values of @xmath47 are effectively zero .",
    "this result implies that the strength of the nonlinear effect depends on mass scales , being strongest on the galactic mass scale .",
    "note , however , here that the value of the characteristic mass scale changes with @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the results given in  3.2 and  3.4 are related to each other .      as mentioned in  2.3 ,",
    "if the nonlinear effect dominates on the halo spin - spin correlations , then it is likely to produce stronger cross - correlations between different mass scales ( eq.[[eqn : crn ] ] ) .",

    "it is found that on two different galactic mass scales ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the cross - correlations exist at scales as large as @xmath2mpc , due to the growth of the non - gaussianity increases cross - correlations of the tidal field on different scales .",

    "<S> the non - gaussian contribution to the intrinsic halo spin alignments is analytically modeled and numerically detected . assuming that the growth of non - gaussianity in the density fluctuations caused the tidal field to have nonlinear - order effect on the orientations of the halo angular momentum , we model the intrinsic halo spin alignments as a linear scaling of the density correlations on large scales , which is different from the previous quadratic - scaling model based on the linear tidal torque theory . </S>",
    "<S> then , we analyze the halo catalogs from the recent high - resolution millennium run simulation at four different redshifts ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and measure quantitatively the degree of the nonlinear effect on the halo spin alignments and its changes with redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> a clear signal of spin correlations is found on scales as large as @xmath2mpc at @xmath3 , which marks a detection of the nonlinear tidal effect on the intrinsic halo alignments . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate how the nonlinear effect depends on the intrinsic properties of the halos . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the degree of the nonlinear tidal effect increases as the halo mass scale decreases , the halo specific angular momentum increases , and the halo peculiar velocity decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implication of our result on the weak gravitational lensing . </S>"
