    "market impact is the effect on the price caused by an order , and it measures the tendency of prices to move up ( down ) subsequent to a buy ( sell ) trade of a given size @xcite .",
    "understanding market impact is a fundamental problem in financial markets , and it has recently been the subject of several studies , both empirical @xcite and theoretical @xcite . from a theoretical perspective , market impact is related to the problem of understanding how information is incorporated into security prices @xcite .    for practitioners ,",
    "controlling market impact is essential in order to limit execution costs , which arise because each trade impacts adversely on the price .",
    "in addition , traders often face the problem of executing orders whose volume is much larger than the outstanding liquidity which is available for trading at each moment in time , which is typically a factor @xmath2 smaller than the volumes exchanged daily @xcite .",
    "a common strategy consists in splitting large orders in a sequence of child orders that are executed incrementally .",
    "this sequence of trades is commonly called _",
    "meta - order_. the trading activity generated by meta - orders has been argued to be one of the origins of long range auto - correlation in the flow of orders in financial markets @xcite , and generates market impact which extends beyond that of single orders .",
    "one robust empirical finding is the fact that market impact is a concave function of the order size both for individual orders @xcite and for meta - orders @xcite , in contrast with early models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which predict a linear impact .",
    "understanding market impact requires addressing the strategic interaction between liquidity providers and liquidity takers , and in particular modeling how the former exploit the predictable trading patterns of the latter .",
    "kyle s seminal paper @xcite and its most recent extension to meta - orders @xcite build on this key ingredient , but are limited to simple ( representative ) agent settings .",
    "in addition , the assumption of perfectly informed agents hardly suits to realistic settings .",
    "more recent theoretical studies on market impact have been done within the framework of order - book models @xcite , which provide an accurate description of the market microstructure .",
    "we take a complementary approach by using a coarse - grained description of the market , focusing on the collective behavior of a set of heterogeneous adaptive market participants .",
    "the natural framework for addressing this issue is the minority game ( mg ) @xcite , which is a paradigmatic model of heterogeneous adaptive agents who repeatedly interact in a market setting using simple `` trading strategies '' to either buy or sell an asset , with the objective of being in the minority side ( i.e.  selling when the majority buys or vice - versa ) . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the mg offers a picture of a financial market as a many - agent interacting system where speculators `` predate '' on predictable patterns introduced by other agents , much as in real financial markets . as such , the mg shows , in a simplified setting , how markets aggregate information as a result of speculative activity . in brief",
    ", one can distinguish an `` asymmetric '' phase , characterized by the presence of statistical arbitrages when speculative pressure is low , from a `` symmetric '' phase , when there are many speculators and the market is unpredicable @xcite .",
    "close to the transition between the two regimes several stylized facts observed in financial markets can be successfully described by slightly generalizing the original mg problem @xcite .",
    "the mg is the appropriate setting for studying the market impact of meta - orders , because it reproduces the response of adaptive traders to perturbations introduced by the persistent activity of meta - orders .",
    "a meta - order is introduced in the mg by adding an extra agent that consistently buys ( or sells ) for a finite time period , after which the extra agent is removed , and the meta - order finishes . in order to analyze how this perturbation affects the price",
    ", one needs to make an assumption on how the price is related to excess demand . here",
    "we assume a market clearing mechanism @xcite taking a linear relation between them .",
    "alternative approaches are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sectionconclusion ] .",
    "this allows us to estimate the impact of the meta - order on price , during and after its execution .",
    "our main findings are : _",
    "i ) _ in the predictable phase the permanent impact is nonzero , while in the unpredictable phase there is no permanent impact ; _ ii ) _ the permanent impact can be computed analytically , relating it to response functions . finally , _",
    "iii ) _ we find that the market impact is linear with the size of the order , as a consequence of the assumed linear relation between price and excess demand .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model , discuss its phase transition and explain how the meta - order is introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sectionresults ] we present our results and in sec .  [ sectionconclusion ] we draw the main conclusions . furthermore , we add appendices with the calculations used to obtain the analytical results .",
    "the mg describes a set of agents interacting in a market over a sequence of periods labeled by a discrete time variable @xmath3 .",
    "each period corresponds to the trading activity in a time window @xmath4 .",
    "a realistic value for @xmath5 must be much larger than inter - trade times , e.g.  @xmath6 s , and can be thought as being the typical time over which meaningful information accumulates , e.g. few minutes min price dynamics is dominated by noise , whereas @xcite show that the structure of correlations of daily returns can be recovered already from the analysis of returns over @xmath7 minutes .",
    "similar results have been discussed in @xcite . ] .",
    "speculators act in the market by using trading strategies that process the value of a public information signal @xmath8 and submit orders accordingly . in practice ,",
    "a number of trading strategies is constantly being evaluated and the most profitable are used .",
    "profitable strategies are those that dictate to buy when the majority is selling or vice - versa , i.e.  that place the trader in the minority side as frequently as possible .",
    "this captures in a simple manner the market making activity of liquidity providers .",
    "formally , we consider the grand - canonical mg setup @xcite . the information to which traders react",
    "can take @xmath9 values , labeled by @xmath10 .",
    "every time step a new signal @xmath11 is drawn at random .",
    "we suppose there are two types of traders : liquidity takers  also called producers in @xcite  and speculators or liquidity providers . there are @xmath12 producers and @xmath13 speculators and their only difference is that while the former react to information signals in a deterministic manner , the latter are adaptive .    specifically , each agent @xmath14 is endowed with a trading strategy @xmath15 , that dictates whether to buy ( @xmath16 ) or to sell ( @xmath17 ) when public information is @xmath18 .",
    "these strategies are independently drawn for each player , uniformly in the set of all @xmath19 possible binary functions @xmath20 . however , while producers always trade according to their strategy , speculators may choose to trade or not , adapting their behavior to the profitability of their strategy .",
    "this choice is encoded in a dynamical variable @xmath21 , which takes the value @xmath22 if agent @xmath14 decides to trade , and @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "the profitability of a strategy is quantified by a score @xmath24 that is updated according to @xmath25 where the excess demand @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the sum of the contributions from producers when @xmath18 .",
    "the decision of playing or not is taken in accordance to the score of the speculator . in the simplest case , agent @xmath14 does not trade if @xmath29 whereas she trades if the score is positive . in summary , a time - step iteration of the model is realized in the following way :    * randomly generate a information variable @xmath30 ; * for each speculator @xmath14 , set @xmath22 if @xmath31 , and @xmath23 otherwise ; * calculate @xmath26 using eq .",
    "( [ defa ] ) ; * for each speculator @xmath14 , update @xmath32 by eq .",
    "( [ defscore ] ) ; * set @xmath33 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this model has a very rich phenomenology . in the limit of large markets , analog to the thermodynamic limit in physics ,",
    "the non - trivial regime arises when @xmath34 , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 remain finite . a central role in the characterization of the collective behavior",
    "is played by the quantity @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the average of @xmath26 conditional on @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath39 detects the presence of statistical arbitrages , in that if @xmath40 there is at least one value of @xmath8 which allows for a statistical prediction of the excess demand when @xmath18 . for this reason @xmath39 is called predictability .",
    "a remarkable feature of the mg is that the dynamics converges to states of minimal predictability @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this is not only appealing conceptually , as it says that speculators leave the market as unpredictable as possible given their strategies , but it also opens the possibility for analytic approaches to the mg .",
    "indeed , it turns the study of the stationary state of the mg into the analysis of the minima of @xmath39 , as a function of the variables @xmath41 .",
    "this is akin to studying the ground state properties of a disordered system in physics , a problem for which a plethora of powerful tools has been developed in recent years @xcite . in appendix [ ap1 ]",
    "we show how this is done by calculating the critical line and the predictability in the asymmetric phase . in brief",
    ", one finds that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eqg ] ) in the appendix [ ap1 ] and @xmath44 can be interpreted as an agent susceptibility , as it measures the response of agents behavior to a change @xmath45 in their strategies emerges as the integrated response of an instantaneous perturbation . loosely speaking , it measures the time over which agents s behavior maintains memory of perturbations . ] .",
    "the relation between @xmath46 and @xmath43 on @xmath47 and @xmath48 is discussed in the appendix , here we focus on the resulting picture of the behavior of the mg , which can be summarized as follows . for a fixed value of @xmath48 ,",
    "if @xmath47 is small enough the market is predictable ( @xmath40 ) and the susceptibility @xmath46 is finite . in words ,",
    "the number of speculators is not enough to exploit the amount of statistical arbitrages introduced by producers .",
    "when @xmath47 increases , @xmath39 decreases whereas @xmath46 increases , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eqhdef ] ) . beyond a critical value @xmath49",
    "the susceptibility diverges ( @xmath50 ) and the market is unpredictable ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the point @xmath49 marks a phase transition in that it separates two regions with distinctly different features . in this paper",
    "we focus on the case @xmath52 , for which the critical value is @xmath53 .      in order to introduce a meta - order in the grand - canonical mg",
    "we add a fixed buyer to the system .",
    "that is , we add one extra producer that always buys independently of the public information pattern .",
    "this extra producer buys a quantity @xmath0 of assets at each time , for @xmath1 time steps .",
    "this models a meta - order of duration @xmath1 , and total size @xmath54 . since typical relaxation times in the mg",
    "are proportional to @xmath9 , we ll consider @xmath1 proportional to @xmath9 in what follows , which might correspond to time - scales of one trading day .",
    "note that turning on the meta - order corresponds to changing the excess demand to @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 otherwise .",
    "this way of modeling the unwinding of a meta - order is reminiscent of a very common scheduling strategy ( the twap scheme ) , in which the trader s target is to execute a quantity of shares which grows linearly in time @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that , imposing a market clearing condition ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the quantity @xmath26 is proportional to the return of the logarithm of the price , which is given by @xmath59 different market mechanisms can imply a different relation between price change @xmath60 and excess demand @xmath26 .",
    "this relation has implications in how the market impact depends on the order size , which is of central importance in market impact studies .",
    "our definition is likely to be appropriate at large time scales ( say , between one day and a week ) , in which one expects stochasticity not to play a dominant role in the description of the market clearing mechanism .",
    "we shall return to this point in the conclusions .",
    "we define the price impact as the averaged log - price change in presence of the meta - order , minus the trend component which would have been present in the unperturbed case .",
    "this corresponds to the quantity @xmath61 where @xmath62 corresponds to the beginning of the meta - order , the average over the stationary state distribution is denoted with @xmath63 and the one over the possible choices of the fixed strategies @xmath64 has been written as @xmath65 .",
    "this averaging procedure mimics the averages in empirical studies , which are on different orders at different times , as well as on different markets @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath66 is expected to be zero only after averaging over the fixed strategies , as in the asymmetric phase its value is finite , and fluctuates from realization to realization .",

    "( [ eqimpact ] ) are numerically estimated according to the following procedure .",
    "initially all the scores are set to zero and the model is run until it relaxes to the stationary state . in this initial phase of",
    "the evolution speculators adapt to the information injected by producers in the absence of a meta - order .",
    "then we compute @xmath68 taking a time average in the stationary state . ] .",
    "after that the meta - order is turned on and we start measuring the impact .",
    "finally the average over the fixed strategies is computed by repeating this procedure for a large number of realizations .",
    "we will also consider @xmath69 for @xmath70 , since we are interested in the response of the system after the meta - order is turned - off .",
    "of particular interest is the permanent impact , which reads @xmath71 , and the average execution cost @xmath72\\ ] ] which measures the mean price increment incurred during the meta - order . in particular",
    ", it is a simple exercise to show that the cost of an execution for a trader is related to the maximum price increment @xmath73 as @xmath74 the estimation of the above quantity provides a practical mean to evaluate the concavity of price impact : for a market impact of the form @xmath75 , one finds that @xmath76 , which indicates that concave impact functions have to be associated with a value of @xmath77 , while for convex impact functions a value smaller than @xmath78 has to be expected .",
    "let us first analyze how the impact changes depending on whether the model is in the symmetric or the asymmetric phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the impact @xmath69 , obtained from numerical simulations , as a function of time for @xmath79 ( predictable phase ) and @xmath80 ( unpredictable phase ) . in the predictable phase the impact grows linearly during the meta - order . after the meta - order finishes",
    ", it decays to a constant faster than a power law , but with a long relaxation time . in the unpredictable phase",
    "the situation is rather different . during",
    "the meta - order the impact grows initially very fast and then it reaches a saturation value .",
    "after the meta - order is finished the impact quickly relaxes back to zero .",
    "therefore , as a main result of this paper , we find that if the market is unpredictable ( @xmath51 ) the permanent impact is zero and if the market is predictable ( @xmath40 ) the permanent impact is non - zero .",
    "we point out that the permanent impact is zero in the symmetric phase as long as the the duration of the meta - order @xmath1 is big enough such that the impact saturates before the end of the meta - order .",
    "if @xmath1 is much smaller than the time for saturation to set in , the permanent impact in the symmetric phase is non - zero .    in terms of the excess demand we have the following picture : immediately after the order is turned on , the ( average ) excess demand jumps from @xmath81 to @xmath0 . during the execution of the meta - order it relaxes to a value smaller than @xmath0 . in the unpredictable phase ,",
    "this value is zero , whereas in the predictable phase it is finite , implying a linear growth of the impact . at the end of the meta - order ( @xmath82 ) the excess demand suddenly drops by @xmath0 , thus becoming negative .",
    "finally it relaxes back to zero , regardless of the phase .    , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 realizations . on the left side",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    this result can be explained in the following way .",
    "if predictability is zero , it means that the market is information free and the system is able to absorb the extra information of the extra fixed buyer . therefore , the value of the excess demand relaxes back to zero during the meta - order . on the other hand ,",
    "when the market is predictable the number of speculators is not enough to consume all the information available .",
    "hence , when the perturbation is added , the system reaches a new stationary state where the value of the excess demand is non - zero .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the impact grows linearly with the order size @xmath85 .",
    "indeed the rescaled impact @xmath86 collapses on the same curve , when plotted against @xmath87 .",

    "* ) which find a square root law @xmath88 .",
    "we will come back to this issue in the concluding section .",

    "the collapse of the curves shows that the market impact grows linearly with h.,width=275 ]    these results are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions . as we show in appendix [ ap2 ] , the stationary state of the system in the presence of the meta - order can be calculated by minimizing the predictability @xmath39 with the modified excess demand ( [ aperturbed ] ) .",
    "this allows us to calculate the saturation value of the excess demand before the meta - order is finished , which is given by @xmath90 in order to obtain it numerically we calculate the slope of the curves of @xmath69 when the linear growth of the impact sets in , after some initial transient . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we can see that the numerical results are in full agreement with the exact calculation .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath91 , which measures the response of the market to a perturbation @xmath92 , is inversely proportional to the susceptibility @xmath46 of agents behavior .",
    "the market impact is larger when agents are not very susceptible to perturbations , whereas it is minimal in the symmetric phase ( @xmath51 ) , when agents respond strongly to any perturbation .",
    "obtained analytically ( full line ) and from numerical simulations ( open circles ) .",
    "the error on the points from numerical simulations is at most of the size of the open circles.,width=275 ]    in order to address the dynamic effects of market impact , it is necessary to reformulate the dynamics in a continuum time description which acknowledges the fact that characteristic times in the mg are of order @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "as long as the perturbation @xmath0 is much smaller than @xmath93 , linear response theory holds , i.e. , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the perturbation and @xmath96 is a kernel that contains the relaxation dynamics . note that if @xmath97 we expect to recover the stationary value of eq .",
    "( [ avgah ] ) , hence @xmath98 .",
    "also causality requires @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "we remark that in order to reproduce the small time behavior of the model ( i.e.  @xmath101 for small @xmath102 ) , the function @xmath96 must have the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is non - singular in zero , causal ( @xmath105 for @xmath100 ) and @xmath106 .",

    "( [ permanent ] ) and numerical results .",

    "this should be compared with @xmath118 reported in empirical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with the arguments in @xcite .",
    "the market impact has been the subject of intense discussion recently .",
    "proposals of universal laws have been put forward @xcite on the basis of empirical analysis and simple models . here",
    "we address this issue within the framework of the minority game . at odds with zero - intelligence ( or @xmath119-intelligence @xcite ) models",
    ", the mg retains a level of rationality of the agents without making strong assumptions on their information on future returns ( as in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "rather , traders learn adaptively on the profitability of their strategies .",
    "in addition , the minority rule is rather appropriate if one focuses on market making activity , where the profit of agents comes from matching imbalances in demand . finally , the mg is the ideal platform to address how markets digest information on order imbalances from meta - orders and to address the issue of the market impact beyond its immediate consequences .",
    "we have shown that the mg provides realistic curves for the market impacts and sheds light on the mechanisms which are responsible for it .",
    "most interesting , we derive a relation between market impact and information efficiency , whereby the permanent impact of a meta - order is smaller the more the market is free of statistical arbitrages . for a perfectly `` symmetric '' market where returns are statistically unpredictable , prices should revert to the values before the order started , and hence the permanent impact should be zero .",
    "understanding whether this relation extends to other modeling frameworks or whether it is confirmed by empirical data , is a very interesting issue for future research .",
    "a noticeable shortcoming of our analysis pertains the prediction of a linear impact with order size ( @xmath120 in our notations ) , which contradicts the observed concave behavior @xmath121 , with @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to identify the origin of this behavior within the mg , in the assumed market mechanism .",
    "this assumes a matching of orders at a single deterministic price , fixed by market clearing .",
    "indeed , the price itself does not enter into the definition of the mg . strictly speaking",
    "the mg describes the dynamics of the excess demand , and how this is determined by market makers who adaptively respond to it , in their effort to match it dynamically .",
    "therefore , on one side this suggest to look for alternative definitions of the price in the mg , capturing more faithfully the dynamics of the order book . on the other , this suggest to look at empirical measures of the market impact in terms of the demand imbalance itself .    the analysis of the more realistic case in which the size of the orders @xmath54 is pareto distributed would also be a relevant extension of the present work , and could allow the model to describe persistence of the order flow ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "there are two possible choices : either @xmath0 can be pareto distributed and @xmath1 fixed , or , vice versa , @xmath1 is pareto distributed and @xmath0 fixed . in the former case it would not be possible to apply linear response theory , since there will be realizations with @xmath123 , which is not a small perturbation . in the latter case it must be considered that when one measures the market impact averaged over orders of different volumes for a given value of volume @xmath124 , only the orders whose volume is larger than or equal to @xmath124 are taken into account .",
    "if the difference in volume depends only on the difference in the length of the order then , at a given time , only the orders which are still standing are taken into the average . as a consequence ,",
    "it is easy to show that , at least during the execution of the meta - order , the market impact is still linear with respect to the volume .",
    "alternatively , it would be very interesting to study a pareto distributed order flow for the environment ( i.e. by assigning to the producers strategies which lead to large fluctuations of the excess demand @xmath28 ) . in this case",
    "the market stationary properties should be different , and an anomalous response to a meta - order could emerge .",
    "it is not easy to anticipate what the behavior of the system would be as the problem becomes harder to solve analytically .    finally ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the market impact is expected to cross - over to a linear behavior for times longer than few days .",
    "this supports the view that the mg provides a description of market activity on intermediate time - scales , with @xmath9 representing a time - scale between one day and a week .",
