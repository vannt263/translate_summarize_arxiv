    "a central controversy in the field of high - temperature superconductivity concerns the nature of the magnetic response in the normal state : does it come from local moments or mobile conduction electrons ? the bulk spin susceptibility , @xmath6 , has been central to the discussion , but the analysis so far has been ambiguous . for example , in underdoped cuprates one experimentally observes a decrease in the normal - state @xmath6  on cooling below some characteristic temperature @xmath7.@xcite when this behavior was first identified in underdoped yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10  through measurements of the y knight shift by alloul and coworkers,@xcite it was interpreted as evidence for the development of a pseudogap in the electronic density of states .",
    "such a perspective attributes the bulk magnetic response to paramagnetism of the conduction electrons ( pauli paramagnetism ) , and it is often cited.@xcite in contrast , johnston@xcite proposed that @xmath6@xmath11 consists of two - components : 1 ) a temperature - dependent portion that scales with doping and that is associated with antiferromagnetically - correlated cu moments , and 2 ) a pauli contribution that happens to be roughly proportional to the doped hole density .",
    "this alternative approach also remains popular.@xcite    clearly , the temperature dependence of @xmath6  is closely tied to the issue of the pseudogap,@xcite a continuing conundrum and challenge .",
    "the nature of the spin response is also part of the ongoing discussion on the dynamic susceptibility , where the momentum- and energy - dependent structure observed by neutron scattering has generally been interpreted either as the response of conduction electrons scattering across the fermi surface@xcite or as fluctuations of local cu moments.@xcite while there is much debate on the dynamic response , we have seen little critical discussion of the alternative interpretations of the static susceptibility , or reconsideration of the assumptions that went into analyses first developed two decades ago , typically applied to measurements on polycrystalline samples.@xcite    in this paper , we present bulk susceptibility measurements performed on a single crystal of @xmath0 .",
    "we go through a stepwise analysis of the data , considering the extent to which we can distinguish between contributions from mobile charge carriers and local moments .",
    "one criterion for such a distinction is anisotropy : pauli paramagnetism is expected to be isotropic , whereas the paramagnetic response of local moments depends on the orientation of the applied field due to anisotropic gyromagnetic factors .",
    "thus , from the fact that we observe a temperature - dependent anisotropy of the susceptibility in the paramagnetic regime , we can conclude that there are significant contributions from local moments .",
    "our most direct evidence for local moments comes from the temperature regime below the spin - ordering transition that has been characterized by neutron diffraction.@xcite there we see an evolution of the anisotropic susceptibility that can be simply interpreted in terms of the classic expectations for a non - collinear antiferromagnet ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "furthermore , on following the magnetization vs.  applied field , we find evidence for a spin - flop transition at @xmath12  t. such a transition is consistent with an anisotropy of the superexhange interaction between local moments .    to describe the doping dependence of the susceptibility of polycrystalline @xmath13 , johnston@xcite proposed that there should be a component @xmath14 due to antiferromagnetically - coupled local moments .",
    "furthermore , he assumed that it had the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a normalized `` universal '' function .",
    "he found that he could get a good fit to the data if he included a temperature - independent component with a magnitude roughly proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the same scaling analysis was later applied to a more extensive set of measurements by nakano _",
    "et al._@xcite the temperature - independent component is generally assumed to correspond to the pauli susceptibility , @xmath18 , associated with the doped carriers .    this successful , but _",
    "ad hoc _ , decomposition has been widely applied , and we initially attempted to use it on our own results to separate out the contribution from local moments .",
    "we found , however , that a @xmath18  component of the commonly accepted magnitude is not compatible with the large anisotropy observed in the single crystal data .",
    "we have strengthened our case by extending the analysis to include data for @xmath1  with @xmath2 and 0.155 .",
    "we conclude that any temperature - independent @xmath18  component must be an order of magnitude smaller than that reported in refs . .",
    "as a result of the much reduced @xmath18 , the extracted @xmath14 is larger at low temperature than previously assumed . based on our new insights , we discuss the implications for the evolution of magnetic correlations in @xmath13  and @xmath1  vs.  doping and temperature .",
    "in particular , we show that the maximum of @xmath14@xmath11 , which occurs at @xmath19 , is inversely proportional to the effective superexchange energy @xmath20 determined by raman and neutron scattering .",

    "all of the spin response comes from delocalized conduction electrons .",
    "the doped cuprates are unusual metals , but one can nevertheless consider the extent to which the charge carriers also determine the magnetic response .",

    "<S> our conclusion is strengthened by extending the quantitative analysis to include crystals of @xmath1  with @xmath2 and 0.155 . on the basis of our results , we present a revised interpretation of the temperature and doping dependence of the spin susceptibility in la@xmath3(sr , ba)@xmath4cuo@xmath5 . </S>"
