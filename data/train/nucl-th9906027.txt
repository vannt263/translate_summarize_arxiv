    "in a recent paper @xcite a statistical theory of the bound states of atomic nuclei has been developed , where a new definition of the nuclear mean field ( mf ) and of the fluctuations around it ( the `` error '' ) are given .",
    "the aim of this theory is to provide an alternative route to overcome the problem presented by the strong forces acting among the nucleons inside nuclei at short distances .",
    "these indeed entail very large matrix elements between the ground and the highly excited nuclear states , thus mixing into the former quite complex configurations .",
    "for this physics , in spite of the many approaches worked out in the past , perturbative treatments are of little value .",
    "hence , the mf is obtained in @xcite through an _ energy average _ that smoothes out short time events .",
    "furthermore , the matrix elements of the residual interaction ( the one remaining after the _ average _ interaction is removed ) are assumed to be _ random _ with vanishing average value .",
    "these two elements are sufficient to obtain the mf and the `` error '' , which of course should be small for the mf to be meaningful .",
    "concerning the error , while its average is zero , the _ average of its square _ is not and , in our framework , it can be computed .",
    "indeed , we have organized the energy fluctuations in classes of excited states of increasing complexity , each class yielding a contribution to the error .",
    "notably , a criterion for the convergence of the expansion of the latter in the complexity of the states has been obtained .",
    "the above outlined statistical framework has been applied in @xcite to the problem of nuclear matter , in order to provide an appreciation of the results the approach leads to . in carrying out this analysis ,",
    "however , rough approximations were made , which might cast some doubts on the validity of our findings .",
    "prominent among the latter is the one related to the dramatic reduction of the strength of the residual interaction , with respect to the bare one .",
    "also the very fact that a statistical computation of the ground state energy of nuclear matter yields a reasonable result with a spectroscopic factor varying between consistent values across the energy range of the fluctuation is relevant .    in this paper",
    "we remove the approximations referred to above and explore whether our previous findings survive the test of a more accurate analysis . at the same time",
    "we examine the dependence upon the two inputs required by our scheme , namely the hartree - fock ( hf ) energy and the average energy of the two particle  two hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations . of significance",
    "is the following : if a reliable estimate of the latter is available , then our theory essentially becomes parameter free .",
    "furthermore , the closer the hf energy comes to the empirical binding energy of nuclear matter , the smaller the fluctuations are .",
    "while for the general presentation of the formalism we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , here we confine ourselves to shortly revisit the basic equations we shall need in the following . these stem from the theory of nuclear reactions developed by one of us @xcite , where the projection operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 are introduced and the schroedinger equation is split into two coupled equations    [ eq : schr ] @xmath2    with obvious meaning of the symbols . from these the equation @xmath3 for the system",
    "s wave function projected into the @xmath0-space follows . in ( [ eq : hcal ] ) the standard definitions    @xmath4    have been adopted .",
    "the strategy of our approach is first to implement the above formalism by splitting the hilbert space in a @xmath0 sector embodying all the `` gentle '' physics and in a @xmath1 sector where the rapidly time dependent physics associated with the violent two - body short range collisions among nucleons is inserted .",
    "clearly , an exact prescription for such a partition can not be given : this , however , might be more an advantage than a flaw , since it adds to the flexibility of the method .",
    "next , an energy averaging procedure is performed into the @xmath1 -space : specifically , the fast energy - dependent operator @xmath5 is averaged , leaving the weakly energy - dependent @xmath6 as it stands .",
    "thus , the equation @xmath7 is obtained . in ( [ eq : hbar ] ) , @xmath8 should be viewed as the mf energy and the angle brackets mean energy and phase averaging .",
    "energy averaging is performed with the smoothing function @xmath9 @xmath10 being a real , positive parameter , which moves the poles of the @xmath1-space away from the @xmath0-space ( the more so , the larger @xmath10 is ) , thus quenching the influence of the former over the latter .    with ( [ eq : rho ] ) one obtains , by applying the cauchy theorem to a contour going along the real axis with a small semi - circle described positively around the @xmath11 pole , @xmath12 in performing the integration in the complex energy plane",
    ", account has been taken of the position of the poles associated with the operator @xmath5 ( they are located in the im@xmath13 half - plane ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the approximation performed in ( [ eq : eqav ] ) exploits the mild energy dependence of @xmath6 , but of course it requires , to be valid , a _ not too large _ value of the parameter @xmath10 . on the other hand",
    ", the latter can not be too small in order to lessen the impact of the @xmath1-space on the @xmath0 one .",
    "hence , @xmath10 is constrained to vary in a rather restricted range .    according to the above",
    ", we obtain for the @xmath0-space energy averaged hamiltonian @xmath14 the expression @xmath15 the associated equation for the averaged wave function reading @xmath16 the energy @xmath8 in ( [ eq : ppsiav ] ) is commonly referred to as the mf ground state energy . in ( [ eq : hbarav ] ) , in analogy with ref .",
    "@xcite , the coupling operators    [ eq : vpqp ] @xmath17 and @xmath18    have been introduced .",
    "they should be viewed as representing what is left out of the interaction among the nucleons after the average value of the latter has been removed .",
    "we note that @xmath19 is zero when @xmath10 vanishes .",
    "the above definitions are convenient because in terms of them the system ( [ eq : schr ] ) can then be _ exactly _ recast as follows :    [ eq : schrav ] @xmath20    as shown in @xcite , is @xmath21 with @xmath22 in ( [ eq : hqq ] ) the prime implies the dropping of the @xmath23 component of @xmath24 .",
    "the physical significance of ( [ eq : e - e0 ] ) relates to the statistical fluctuations of the energy around the average value @xmath8 ( the mf energy ) .",
    "in fact , the average over the random phases of the wave - functions of the @xmath1-space leads to @xmath25 to implement the above constraint we split @xmath26 according to @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 actually , in ( [ eq : dem ] ) the index @xmath30 labels different sets of states of increasing complexity , which contribute _ independently _ to the error , the number of sets being @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , for each @xmath30 @xmath32 hence ( [ eq : de0 ] ) follows .    we shall confine ourselves to consider the first set ( @xmath33 ) only and will enforce ( [ eq : dem0 ] ) by defining @xmath34_{\\text av } , \\ ] ] whose square we shall evaluate in the following",
    "now , while @xmath35 vanishes , @xmath36 does not .",
    "we compute it , again assuming random matrix elements , as in @xcite , but dropping a severe assumption there made . for this purpose let the ground state , either of nuclear matter or of a finite nucleus , be @xmath37 . assuming the residual interaction to be of two - body character",
    ", then the @xmath33 set will be made up of 2p-2h states @xmath38 and the propagator of the system in the @xmath33 sector will obey the equation @xmath39 the index @xmath40 embodying the quantum numbers identifying the 2p-2h states .",
    "then @xmath41 where an average 2p-2h eigenvalue @xmath42 has been introduced in the denominator , which has not been averaged owing to its smooth energy dependence .    next , neglecting in the above the fourth order and because of the randomness of the phases of the states , we finally arrive at the expression @xmath43 where the sum goes over the 2p-2h states contained in the energy range @xmath44 around @xmath42 over which the average is carried out .",
    "in order to apply the formalism previously outlined a choice for the projection operator @xmath0 should be made .",
    "we start with the simplest one , namely we take @xmath45 @xmath46 being the hf ground state wave - function ( the fermi sphere in the nuclear matter case ) .    then , by combining ( [ eq : phf ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppsiav ] ) , it is not difficult to derive the mf equation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath47 which relates the mf energy @xmath8 , the hf energy @xmath48 and the true energy of the system @xmath49 . in ( [ eq : mfeq ] ) @xmath50 to proceed further , we elaborate the relation ( [ eq : de1appr ] ) in order to express the fluctuations of the ground state energy around @xmath8 also in terms of @xmath51 . for this purpose , we write @xmath52 in the above , the operator @xmath53 corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the quantity within the angle brackets over the set of the 2p-2h states in the energy interval @xmath10 centered around @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , because of the randomness of the wave functions , the sum over @xmath54 vanishes .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath55 @xmath56 being the number of states over which the sum is performed .    to obtain the latter we make use of ericson s statistical theory of nuclear states @xcite , which yields for the density of the spin @xmath57 nuclear levels set up with @xmath58 particle ( p)-hole ( h ) ( @xmath58=p+h ) excitations the expression @xmath59 , \\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the so - called spin cut - off parameter . in ( [ eq : sigma ] )",
    "@xmath61 is a constant and @xmath62 the system s moment of inertia .",
    "note that the energy @xmath63 in ( [ eq : rhon ] ) is the positive excitation energy of the states of concern .    the number of levels is then given by the expression @xmath64 @xmath65 being the distance in energy between the spin - zero 2p-2h excitations ,  the ones we confine ourselves , for the sake of simplicity , to consider .",
    "hence , from ( [ eq : de1ar ] ) , it follows @xmath66 and , by taking the square root , @xmath67 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mfeq ] ) and ( [ eq : flucteq ] ) together make up two non - linear systems , eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucteq ] ) being taken with the plus and the minus sign , respectively , in the first and in the second system .",
    "the difference with the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite lies in the factor @xmath68 .    in our approach",
    "the unknown quantities in the systems are either @xmath49 and @xmath8 , if a model for the matrix elements of the residual interaction is available , or @xmath8 and @xmath51 , if @xmath49 is experimentally measured and one wishes to extract the residual effective interaction from the data . in this paper",
    ", we shall follow the second option .",
    "for definiteness we call the solutions of the first system @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) and , likewise , the solutions of the second system @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) , the labels @xmath75 and @xmath76 referring to the lower and upper boundaries of the energy band embracing the fluctuations of the ground state energy of the system .",
    "now , both systems lead to the quadratic equation @xmath77 for the mean field energy .",
    "we take the solution with the minus sign in front of the square root , namely @xmath78 since then , in the limit of vanishing residual interaction , which entails the vanishing of @xmath10 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vpqp ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath79 which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucteq ] ) in the same limit . then , when @xmath80 the fluctuation of the ground state energy vanishes and the latter coincides with the mean field value .",
    "concerning the residual effective interaction , one gets from the first system the expression @xmath81      \\right .",

    "@xcite , we have set @xmath83 and the solutions with the minus sign in front of the square root have been discarded because they correspond to a residual effective interaction non - vanishing with @xmath10 .",
    "clearly , if an estimate of the average energy of the 2p-2h states can be derived , then @xmath84 in ( [ eq : eps2 ] ) should not be viewed as a parameter , but merely as a convenient tool to express @xmath42 .",
    "our solutions should fulfill two constraints : the first one is @xmath85 namely the two mean fields stemming from the two systems should be identical .",
    "the second relates to the spectroscopic factor @xmath86 defined through the normalization of the ground state wave - function projected onto the @xmath0-space , namely @xmath87 and found to be @xmath88 in ref .",
    "we require the values of @xmath89 , which approaches one ( as it should ) when @xmath80 , to be `` reasonable '' when computed with our solutions for @xmath49 and @xmath51 on the upper and lower bounds of the energy band , respectively .",

    "notice that formula ( [ eq : enm ] ) embodies not only the experimental binding energy , but the saturation density and the compression modulus of nuclear matter as well .",

    ", one should start from a realistic two - body force , deduce the associated @xmath134-matrix , thus accounting for the deterministic aspect of the short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations and then perform a hf ( in fact , a brueckner - hartree - fock ) calculation .",

    "we have however varied the parameters of our simple two - body force to get @xmath96 closer to the empirical energy , namely getting a hf minimum of -13 mev at @xmath135 @xmath95 with roughly the same empirical compressibility of nuclear matter , thus yielding @xmath136 mev at @xmath105 @xmath95 .",

    "also a large @xmath10 would push away the @xmath1-space , but then our theory , as previously shown , would not work any longer .",
    "in fact , as seen in the figures , the solutions associated with a large @xmath10 also correspond to a large @xmath109 , which does not make any sense .",
    "rather , the trustable solution of our theory is the one corresponding to a @xmath109 of one , at most two , mev and to an energy averaging parameter @xmath138 mev , these outcomes being accompanied by a quenching of the bare interaction of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the latter finding should not surprise : in fact , our residual interaction has been dove - tailed to vanish when @xmath139 and @xmath10 actually is about @xmath140 mev . since the physics associated with the @xmath1-space extends up to several hundred mev , the strong quenching of @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) with respect to @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) immediately follows .",
    "the above results , however , are obtained with a hf energy yielding a poor approximation for the true energy . a @xmath96",
    "closer to the latter entails , as we have seen , a smaller @xmath109 ( but not a smaller @xmath10 ) .",
    "we argue accordingly that our theory provides an appreciation of the error of any theory attempting to calculate the ground state energy of nuclei and , of course , the nearer the theory comes to the true eigenvalue , the smaller the associated error is .",
    "finally , the unrealistic , but consistent , value of our spectroscopic factor has already been commented upon . here",
