    "the nonperturbative dynamics of qcd is crucially affected by the contribution of the light quarks .",
    "one of the most striking effects is the maximal screening of the chromoelectric charges due to fundamental pair production and chromoelectric flux breaking . on the difficult road towards constructing a string dual of ( planar ) qcd or its @xmath0 supersymmetric versions , it is thus mandatory to take care of the fundamental fields .",
    "these are introduced by means of @xmath2 `` flavor '' d - brane sources on a closed string background arising from the backreaction of both the `` flavor '' and @xmath3 `` color '' d - branes .",
    "the flavor branes share with the color ones the ( 4d ) minkowski directions and wrap transverse non compact manifolds : this is how the global flavor symmetry is implemented .",
    "if the flavor branes are on top of each other this symmetry is non abelian .",
    "this obviously interesting setup is quite hard to deal with in practice if the flavor brane backreaction is not neglected : the supergravity equations of motion are a set of coupled partial differential equations with delta function sources . an enormous simplification can be obtained if the number of flavors is very large ( as in the veneziano limit @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 fixed ) : by homogeneously smearing the flavor branes in the transverse space , delta function sources are replaced by density distributions and the relevant equations to solve are ordinary differential equations in a radial variable @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is the generic breaking of the flavor symmetry group into a product of abelian factors .",
    "if the flavors are massless , the flavor branes reach the origin of the transverse space . in the smeared setup",
    "the origin is a very special point : since all the @xmath2 branes overlap there , the flavor symmetry group is generically enhanced .",
    "a global symmetry enhancement is usually signaled by a singularity in the string background : indeed all the known smeared string solutions dual to massless - flavored theories have a ( good ) singularity at the origin .",
    "if the flavors are massive the corresponding d - branes extend up to a certain distance from the origin and in the smeared setups there is no special point where the flavor symmetry is fully enhanced : the singularity due to the flavors disappears and is replaced by a region where there is no flavor d - brane charge at all .",
    "the smeared density distribution , then , depends on the radial coordinate and stops at the boundary of that region . as a result ,",
    "the string solution inside that region is just an unflavored one : this is dual to the fact that for energies smaller than the flavor mass the flavors are integrated out .    in this paper",
    "we find new explicit string solutions accounting for the full backreaction of @xmath7 d3 and @xmath2 smeared d7-branes on the conifold .",
    "each d7-brane is holomorphically embedded in a particular way @xcite that makes the corresponding flavor multiplets massive and the theory `` non chiral '' ( the massless `` chiral '' setup was examined in @xcite and the massive one in @xcite ) .",
    "the unflavored gauge theory is the @xmath0 conformal @xmath8 klebanov - witten ( kw ) quiver theory @xcite .",
    "each d7-brane adds a ( anti ) fundamental flavor to a node of the gauge group .",
    "the resulting gauge theory has a uv landau pole and a superpotential containing only quartic couplings and flavor mass terms .",
    "the new string solutions are then used to get quantitative predictions on the screening effects on the static quark - antiquark potential in the dual field theory at strong coupling .",
    "the analysis shows that both the chromoelectric force between static sources and the screening length are reduced as the number of flavors ( resp .",
    "their mass ) is increased ( resp . reduced ) .",
    "the singular conifold is a six dimensional calabi - yau cone whose defining equation in @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 .",
    "the base of the conifold is the @xmath11 sasaki - einstein manifold whose isometry group is @xmath12 .",
    "the conifold metric can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 + \\frac{1}{9}[d\\psi+\\sum_{i=1}^2\\cos\\theta_id\\varphi_i]^2\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the complex variables @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of the above coordinates .",
    "the low energy dynamics of @xmath7 d3-branes stuck at the tip of the conifold is described by the klebanov - witten ( kw ) theory @xcite .",
    "this is an @xmath0 superconformal quiver theory with gauge group @xmath8 and bifundamental matter fields @xmath19 , arranged in @xmath20 doublets , interacting through a quartic superpotential @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 symmetric ir fixed point of the theory is conjectured to have a dual description in terms of type iib string theory on an @xmath23 background with @xmath7 units of five - form flux through @xmath11 and constant dilaton .",
    "let us now consider a particular and well studied way of adding fundamental degrees of freedom to the model , i.e. by means of @xmath24-symmetric d7-branes wrapping the holomorphic 4-cycle defined by an equation like @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we call this embedding `` non chiral '' because , on the field theory side , a d7-brane adds a fundamental and an antifundamental flavor to one node of the kw quiver and the flavor mass terms do not break the classical flavor symmetry of the massless theory .",
    "the related superpotential is @xcite @xmath26q_1 + \\hat h_2\\,\\tilde q_2 [ b_1a_1-b_2a_2]q_2 + k_i\\,(\\tilde q_i q_i)^2 + m\\,(\\tilde q_i q_i)\\,,\\ ] ] where we have considered a @xmath27-invariant setup where there are two stacks of d7 branes adding the same number of fundamental degrees of freedom to both nodes .",
    "apart from the mass terms , the superpotential contains only quartic couplings .",
    ", the flavors induce cubic couplings in @xmath28 . ]",
    "the embedding preserves a @xmath29 diagonal subgroup of the conifold symmetries .",
    "moreover both the scale invariance and the @xmath30 isometry of the conifold are explicitly broken when @xmath31 .",
    "this is precisely mapped to the explicit breaking of conformal invariance and @xmath32 symmetry driven by the flavor masses ( which are then related to the @xmath33 parameter ) . in the massless case ( @xmath34 )",
    "the previous symmetries are broken at the quantum level .",
    "let us now consider acting with an @xmath35 rotation on the embedding equation @xmath25 . this way we obtain the generalized embedding @xmath36 where @xmath37 span a unit 3-sphere @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 $ ] .",

    "these equations imply that the phase of the mass terms , related to @xmath48 , drives the breaking of the shift symmetry along the @xmath49 direction ( the dual of the @xmath32 symmetry ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath50 , the d7 branes are extended along the radial direction only up to @xmath51 .",
    "the energy of a string stretched along @xmath52 from the origin @xmath53 to @xmath54 is a parameter @xmath55 which is conventionally called `` constituent mass '' of the flavors . when @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "let us now consider @xmath58 branes suitably distributed within the family of embeddings ( [ genang ] ) . in particular , we want to restore effectively the @xmath59 symmetry of @xmath11 which is partially broken by flavor branes on top of each other .",
    "accordingly , we place branes at different values of @xmath60 with a suitably normalized symmetry preserving distribution @xmath61 .    the d7 branes are sources of an @xmath62 rr field with modified bianchi identity @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the density distribution form of the smeared d7-branes .",
    "the general form of @xmath65 is dictated by the symmetry , the only possibility for an exact two - form preserving @xmath66 being @xcite @xmath67 where the function @xmath68 has to follow from the smeared embedding and the dot means derivative w.r.t .",

    "as we have anticipated in the introduction , there is an effectively unflavored region @xmath76 where the d7 density distribution vanishes . in the dual gauge theory",
    ", this corresponds to the @xmath77 regime where the flavors are integrated out .",
    "moreover , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the function @xmath68 asymptotically approaches the constant value @xmath2 , it has the shape of a smoothed out heaviside function , and it is actually well approximated by @xmath80 in the small mass limit @xmath81 .",
    "this shape reflects the fact that at energies @xmath82 the gauge theory effectively behaves as the massless - flavored one .",
    "the ansatz for the ( einstein frame ) metric of the backreacted flavored kw background is of the form @xcite @xmath83 which is a deformation of the kw metric driven by the functions @xmath84 .",
    "the kw solution is obtained when @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath24-symmetry equations for d7 branes on this deformed background can be obtained from those on the kw solution , just by substituting the kw radial coordinate @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the ansatz for the dilaton and the rr forms reads @xmath88 the latter form explicitly solves the modified bianchi identity @xmath89 .",
    "following a general strategy suggested by @xcite we look for a solution of the iib supergravity plus ( smeared ) d7-brane dbi+wz action .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the use of the above d - brane action is well justified in the smeared setups , since the large transverse distance between two generic branes effectively suppresses the coupling @xmath90 .",
    "along the same lines of @xcite , the solution can be found from the supersymmetric variations of the bulk fermions giving rise to the following set of first order differential equations @xmath91 these have exactly the same form as those obtained in the ( chiral ) massless case by @xcite , modulo the substitution of @xmath2 with @xmath68 : this is due to the fact that the supersymmetric fermionic variations only contain the forms @xmath92 and not the @xmath93 terms .",

    "the two gauge couplings run in the same direction ( the beta functions have the same positive signs ) and the net result is a qed - like theory with a uv landau pole at a scale @xmath110 .",

    "using the explicit backreacted solution found above we find ( see figure [ v ] ) that the static quark - antiquark potential is negative and has the same coulomb - like behavior as the unflavored conformal theory . just as in the chiral setup @xcite , @xmath126 decreases with @xmath2 and increases with @xmath55 .",

    "the string setup we have constructed is well aware that this decay can happen as the dynamical @xmath141 pair is popped out of the vacuum .",
    "indeed , due to the presence of the dynamical flavor branes , the open string attached to the d7 probe can break , causing the decay .",
    "the reason why the connected part of the potential is an interesting object in this and related setups is the fact that , due to the smearing over the large transverse volume , each decay of this kind is suppressed as @xmath142 and not as @xmath5 as it would happen if the flavor branes would be on top of each other .",
    "hence the @xmath139 state is _",
    "metastable_.    in the present setup the smallest heavy - light mesons which can be produced are nearly massless ( due to the smearing , there will always exist a dynamical flavor brane intersecting the probe @xmath143 one ) .",
    "the critical length for the decay to happen can be thus estimated as the solution of @xmath144 .",
