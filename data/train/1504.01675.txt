    "this investigation forms part of a long term project aimed at understanding the nearby spiral structure in the third galactic quadrant of the milky way ( hereinafter tgq ) from an optical point of view by means of open clusters .",
    "the still unresolved question about the grand design structure of the milky way ( see , e.g. choi et al .",
    "2014 ) has been demanding an extraordinary observational effort during the last decades . actually , a crucial starting point took place in the @xmath2 when georgelin & georgelin ( 1976 ) produced the first map of the galaxy utilizing hii regions as spiral tracers .",
    "this first map showed that a four arms model fits the observations very well , a concept widely used yet .",
    "since then , a number of other maps showing the structure of the galaxy have been developed by means of different spiral tracers such as molecular clouds ( efremov 1998 ) or by combining them with hii regions ( hou et al .",
    "dame et al .",
    "( 2001 ) collected co observations from several sources to map the entire milky way . while russeil ( 2003 ) carried out a multiwavelength study of the plane of our galaxy and found evidences that favored a four arms model , nakanishi & sofue ( 2003 ) presented a three dimensional map constructed with hi observations concluding that a three arms model is better to fit the observations .",
    "churchwell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) combined data from a variety of sources in the wavelength range from 3.6 to 24 microns adopting also a four arms model but recognizing some difficulties of interpretation .",
    "this is , since the controversy about the number of spiral arms in the galaxy is still open we suggest the readers to have a look to the summary of spiral arms parameters in the valle ( 2013 , 2014 ) paper series and references therein .",
    "however , in almost all these cases distances depend on a rotational curve and the adopted kinematic model .",
    "thus , strong ambiguities take place and only can be resolved by adopting other tracers of spiral structures with distances independent from the properties of the models . in this respect , trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of massive star forming regions in combination with information from hii regions , giant molecular cloud and masers is a promising initiative since distance ambiguities can be removed ( reid et al .",
    "2009 , 2014 ; hou & han ( 2014 ) ) .",
    "just to mention , methanol and water masers have been successfully used for some authors to study particular regions of the milky way such as the local , sagittarius and perseus arms ( xu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , wu et al . 2014 , choi et al . 2014 , among others ) .    in this framework ,",
    "young open clusters become excellent spiral tracers since they can be observed at large distances .",
    "the additional advantage of using open clusters is that their distances do not rely on any rotational curve and kinematic model .",
    "contrarily , observations and detection of open clusters are highly dependent of the visual extinction along the line of view in the galactic plane .",
    "several investigations biased to study the large structure of the milky way using open clusters and stellar component were developed by moffat & vogt ( 1973 ) and vogt & moffat ( 1975 ) although with a strong magnitude cut - off .",
    "this precluded from arriving to conclusive definitions about the extension of the local arm ( orion ) , the angular recognition ( and the real entity ) of the perseus arm and the possible trace of the outer arm ( norma - cygnus ) .",
    "some other efforts were carried out by mccarthy & miller ( 1974 ) , moffat & fitzgerald ( 1974 ) , clari ( 1974 ) , reed & fitzgerald ( 1984ab ) , slawson & reed ( 1988 ) , reed & fitzgerald ( 1985 ) , reed ( 1990 ) , all of them concerning the distribution and structure shown by the stellar components and also by open clusters .",
    "most of the optical inspections performed in the tgq were concentrated along the region @xmath3 to @xmath4 in longitude , including the puppis and vela regions .",
    "this could be done , in part , thanks to the presence of a dust - window , the so - called fitzgerald window ( fitzgerald 1968 ) near the puppis association .",
    "a thorough information on related earlier works can be found in reed ( 1989 ) but we also suggest the contribution from kaltcheva & hilditch ( 2000 ) who revealed the presence of very distant blue stars in the longitude interval from @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , the absorption has been the greatest obstacle to observations . during the last two decades",
    "a notorious feature has been confirmed in the tgq from the dust mapping for schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) together with the hydrogen emission maps from shassa ; these two surveys suggest a symmetry brake - up in the sense that both , dust and emission ( neutral gas ) show a tendency to locate below the formal galactic plane at @xmath6 galactic latitude .",
    "this fact is in agreement with previous investigations where it has been shown that the hi layer in the galaxy flares , becomes thicker at larger distances from the galactic center ( henderson et al .",
    "1982 ; kulkarni et al . 1982 ; burton & te lintel hekkert 1986 ) on a side . on the other ,",
    "a tendency for the tgq gas clouds to fall below the galactic plane has been revealed and interpreted as evidence for warp in the molecular disk as well ( may , murphy & thaddeus 1988 ; may et al . 1997 ) .",
    "co observations of the infrared astronomical system ( iras ) sources wouterloot et al .",
    "( 1990 ) concluded that , although the hi layer is substantially thicker than the molecular clouds layer in the inner galaxy , the z - height distribution of the molecular clouds show the same thickness in the outer galaxy .",
    "a few years ago our group ( vzquez et al .",
    "2008 , carraro et al . 2005 , moitinho et al .",
    "2006 , carraro et al .",
    "2015 ) presented and discussed a new picture of the spiral structure in the tgq built by means of a mixture of optical data of open clusters , field blue stars and co sources distributed along 60 degrees in galactic longitude .",
    "this new picture confirms the presence of the warp ( in optical and co ) , reveals the existence of the outer arm and suggests that the local arm extends from the sun to its encounter with the outer arm .",
    "however , none of these studies can give definite evidences about the trace of the perseus arm except for a very few open clusters that , ambiguously , can be related to the local arm too .",
    "our ongoing observational programme at la plata observatory was designed to improve parameters of known clusters and to look for those with no information at all .",
    "this is an essential task that allows us to find far spiral tracers and recognize the grand design spiral structure in the tgq .",
    "so , we report here on results coming from ccd @xmath0 photometry combined with spectroscopic measures for five open clusters , ruprecht 20 , ruprecht 47 , ruprecht 60 , ngc 2660 and ngc 2910 , all of them projected against the vela gum nebula at @xmath7 including vela and puppis associations . to situate the readers the gum nebula ,",
    "one of the biggest hii regions of our galaxy , covers an angular extension of @xmath8 and is centered at @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "sahu ( 1992 ) analyzed the interstellar medium in the zone up to 2 kpc in vela - puppis ; cometary globules and the star formation process in the gum nebula have also been studied by kim et al .",
    "definitely , @xmath11 pup ( o4if ) and @xmath12 vel ( wc8+o7.5 i ) , the ob associations , trumpler 10 and vela ob2 , seem to be the responsible entities of most of the photo - ionization in the nebula itself .",
    "to be remarked is the presence of the iras vela shell ( sahu 1992 ) , an expanding dust shell surrounding vela ob2 with 6 - 8 pc radius enclosing the gum nebula . behind it , the vela molecular ridge ( murphy & may 1991 ) , a superposition of giant co molecular clouds , appears obscuring the farthest part of the galaxy .",
    "the purpose of the present investigation is twofold : on a side we want to re - discuss the parameters of five clusters in the tgq onto the basis of a new set of photometry ( one of them has never before been subject of @xmath0 photometry ) . on the other side , we want to connect the properties of these objects with the structure of puppis and vela associations and look for evidences of the grand design spiral structure .",
    "the photometric observations have been complemented with spectroscopy of several stars located in the cluster regions to discard field interlopers but also to estimate the absorption law .",
    "table 1 lists coordinates of the clusters together with their angular sizes ( from our analysis , in advance ) .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present and discuss the data acquisition of photometry and spectroscopy for five open clusters projected against the vela gum nebula . in ",
    "3 we illustrate the procedure applied for the derivation of fundamental parameters for the cluster sample .",
    "  4 presents a cluster- by- cluster discussion and the trend color excess .",

    "5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "we show in fig . 1 the surveyed areas with ccd @xmath13 photometry of the five clusters in our sample enclosed by squares @xmath14 on a side . ngc 2660 and ngc 2910 were measured at las campanas observatory , chile , on february 1996 with the 0.6-m telescope of the university of toronto southern observatory ( utso ) equipped with a ccd pm @xmath15 methacrome - ii uv coated camera . in these two clusters we carried out @xmath0 photometry .",

    "although useful for recovering the precise locus occupied by cluster members , it is worth recalling that the cluster s linear size is a fundamental but overlooked quantity to characterize these objects .",
    "in fact , precise sizes are necessary for evaluating the cluster evolutionary status through analysis of its density and other related parameters [ see aarseth ( 1996 ) ; de la fuente ( 1997 ) ; kroupa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ] such as the slope of the mass spectrum .",
    "usually , cluster sizes are computed by assuming a centrally peaked spherical stellar distribution and then determining the the distance at which its radial density profile merges with the ( flat ) density of the stellar background . in practice , this determination is normally done either by visually setting this limit in a density radial plot or analytically by fitting a king ( 1962 ) profile to an observed radial density profile . in both approaches a spherically symmetric distribution",
    "is assumed what may not be true since open clusters are , by definition , irregular in shape .",
    "moreover , in the case of the king profiles , it is assumed that the system is dynamically relaxed too .",
    "since a good size estimation reduces quite considerably the field star contamination , we restrict the analysis to stars within the cluster limits .",
    "our starting point consists in adopting cluster center coordinates given in available catalogs ( e.g. webda ) and counting the number of stars found in concentric rings @xmath41 in width around them . instead of using our own photometry",
    "we use 2mass data ( the three bands but particularly the deepest @xmath42 band ) that cover areas larger than ours .",
    "this way we ensure the reliability of the cluster sizes and overcome the effects from visual absorption .",
    "the star counts were divided by the area of each ring following well established receipts ( e.g. carraro et al 2007 ) .",
    "8 shows density profiles for the 5 clusters in our sample .",
    "vertical error bars in the density profiles are computed as the square root of the number of stars divided by the ring surfaces .",
    "the radius of each cluster ( see table 1 ) is shown by an arrows in the point where the cluster density merges with the field stellar density level approximately ( solid lines in fig . 8) .",
    "in all the cases we estimated the field density level by eye .    finally , comparing figs . 1 and 8",
    "we want to emphasize that since cluster radii are larger than the areas we have surveyed our observations are entirely contained within the cluster boundaries and therefore we do not expect high contamination by field interlopers .",
    "thus , we are confident that our observations are useful to yield realistic cluster parameters .",
    "open clusters are usually not far from the galactic plane and appear therefore projected against crowded stellar fields and immersed in regions of high absorption .",
    "this makes the membership assignment a difficult task , particularly amongst faint stars .",
    "all across this article we address memberships applying the classical method of checking simultaneously the consistency of the location of each star in several photometric diagrams ( two color diagrams , hereinafter tcds , and different color - magnitude diagrams , hereinafter cmds ) .",
    "this method is an efficient tool when membership estimates rely on a careful inspection of the tcd and consistent reddening solutions are applied .",
    "contamination for field interlopers is dramatic in crowded fields and may lead , on a side , to bad membership assignments and , on the other consequently , to wrong cluster parameters .",
    "it happens the turn - off point position may be strongly affected by interlopers even in the bright portion of the cmds .",
    "however , we use the @xmath43 index that is much more sensitive to stellar temperature changes than the @xmath44 index ( meynet et al .",
    "1993 ) so that the @xmath45 vs @xmath43 cmd is quite useful for eliminating most of a - f - type field stars contaminating precisely the vertical part of the cluster sequences , especially of young clusters .",
    "the reddening value @xmath46 in each cluster has been computed by superposition of the schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) [ sk82 hereinafter ] zams in the tcd of the cluster .",
    "we shift the zams along the reddening line ( given by the standard relation @xmath47 ) until the best fit to the cluster sequence is achieved . on the other hand , the knowledge of the ratio of total to selective absorption , @xmath48 , must be well established to compute a confident cluster distance .",
    "though the analysis in moitinho ( 2001 ) carried out for several open clusters in the tgq suggests that the extinction law is normal , an additional check of the @xmath49value was performed in the @xmath50 plane in ruprecht 60 , ngc 2660 and ngc 2910 . in this diagram , if the slope of the standard reddening line @xmath51 [ dean et al .",
    "( 1978 ) ] follows the stellar distribution this fact means the extinction law is @xmath52 .",
    "apparent cluster distance moduli were derived then by superposing the sk82 zams onto the observed cluster sequences and the cluster distances from the sun ( @xmath53 ) are obtained after removing absorption from apparent moduli . the fitting error in each cluster",
    "was estimated by eye inspection .    as for cluster ages they were derived under the assumption clusters",
    "are of solar metal content .",
    "we superposed isochrones produced by girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) onto the cluster sequences ( once they have been well established ) putting special emphasis in fitting not only probable members in the upper sequence but also covering the largest possible magnitude range .",
    "however , in four out of the five clusters we were forced to use two ischrones to establish an age range .",
    "various factors such as remaining material from the star formation processes ( affecting young clusters ) , undetected binary stars or unresolved double stars , altogether scatter stars around the mean sequence causing difficulties to achieve a good fit by a single isochrone . in older clusters these difficulties are amplified because of the need to fit simultaneously main sequence and red clump stars as we show in subsections 4.3 . and 4.4 .",
    "spectral types are a powerful and independent tool to estimate distances and color excesses of individual stars and become indispensable to corroborate distances to open clusters . combining mk types and @xmath54 photometry we can easily get the distance of individual stars via the well know spectroscopic parallax method . in the cases of stars in table 4",
    "we proceed to assign intrinsic @xmath55 and @xmath56 colors based in mk types following the relations given in sk82 .",
    "intrinsic colors according to mk types and observed colors allow to get the reddening @xmath46 and derive the @xmath57 to produce free absorption magnitudes @xmath58 mag using the expression given below .",
    "in a couple of late type stars the reddening turned out to be negative .",
    "we think this is due to the low reddening of these stars and uncertainties in the true colors of evolved stars . in these cases",
    "we adopt a reddening value @xmath59 . combining the mk types with absolute magnitudes @xmath60 using sk82 relations we are able to get individual star distances .",
    "the main sources of errors in distances come from photometric uncertainties in color and magnitudes .",
    "this is , the formula :    @xmath61    leads to an error in distance @xmath62 of the form :    @xmath63\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are typical photometric errors in our sample .",
    "this procedure has been successfully applied in perren et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . in the current case",
    ", we assume no error in the extinction law ( @xmath52 ) and no error in the absolute magnitudes ( @xmath60 ) of the stars .",
    "the photometric errors of individual stars with spectral types are all below 0.04 which means that errors in distances derived with the spectroscopic parallax method are all below 10% .",
    "table 4 , columns 8 , 9 and 10 , contains the estimated @xmath46 excesses , adopted @xmath60 and distances for isolated stars with spectral types .",
    "ruprecht 20 was studied by vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) who obtained @xmath54 photoelectric photometry for 11 stars .",
    "although their work calls into question the existence of a true cluster in this region , they assume that stars number 10 , 3 and 18 ( our i d ) [ 6 , 9 and 11 in vogt & moffat notation ] are potential members of luminosity class v ( their assumed luminosity classes are confirmed by our spectroscopy in table 4 but we do not agree they are potential members of ruprecht 20 ) .",
    "vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) obtained the following cluster parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 kpc in case it is a real entity .",
    "this cluster has been subject also of a specific survey aimed at determining radial velocity amongst red giants to secure memberships ( mermilliod et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these authors could find two red giant stars that they assumed likely cluster members .    according to our data the cluster radial density profile of ruprecht 20 shown in fig .",
    "8 , upper left panel , does not suggest the presence of an open cluster since no star grouping is evident .",
    "indeed , the density profile resembles the typical profile produced by random stellar fluctuations .",
    "figure 9 includes from left to right the @xmath69 , @xmath70 and the @xmath71 diagrams . in the tcd , middle panel , we superpose the zams shifted by @xmath72 according to vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) and , simultaneously",
    ", we show the zams fitted to the apparent distance modulus @xmath73 ( @xmath74 kpc ) suggested by them too .",
    "it is simple to see that no cluster sequence is accompanied by this zams fitting or , in other words , it is hard to perceive a cluster sequence in these diagrams .",
    "instead , we see a sparse handful of stars , some of them affected by a similar amount of reddening , @xmath72 , but no traces of any cluster",
    ". this is , exactly , what fig .",
    "8 indicates .",
    "we find the respective distances for the 10 stars with mk spectral types ( see table 4 ) .",
    "according to their classifications , stars 10 , 3 and 18 ( our i d ) are located at distances of approximately 2.55 kpc , 1.99 kpc and 0.95 kpc respectively , demonstrating beyond any doubt they do not belong to any stellar aggregate .",
    "the distance of stars 10 and 3 are of the order of the distance of star 6 ( @xmath75 kpc ) .",
    "but this last is of late evolved type , a k7iii , while star 6 is a b8v and star 9 is a b9v .    in short ,",
    "the cmds and the tcd of ruprecht 20 confirm that no cluster exists in this location but we are dealing with a sparse group of stars mostly of dwarf and giant - types .",
    "to mention is the fact that above the second knee of the zams there are some stars that are hard to interpret .",
    "they are located along the path of the reddening in the tcd and could be very reddened blue stars . however , they are too faint",
    ". they could be sdb type stars but since their average absolute magnitudes are @xmath76 and our magnitude cut - off is @xmath77 mag we do not expect more than a tenths of sdb stars in our frames .",
    "certainly , spectroscopy could help to solve the nature of these objects .",
    "after the above analysis we understand that evidences provided by our photometry and spectral analysis are irrefutable and we conclude that the open cluster ruprecht 20 is not a physical entity . in our opinion the connection of two red giant stars as suggested by mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with this object is unrealistic .",
    "ruprecht 47 also was studied by vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) , who carried out photoelectric photometry on 10 stars . through these observations they placed the cluster at a distance from the sun of 3.03 kpc but , since their observations were limited to only a few stars on the upper main sequence , the authors suggest the true distance value can be quite different .",
    "kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also studied this cluster and found 7 probable members at a distance of the order of 3 kpc with a reddening similar to the obtained by vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) .",
    "this case is quite different from the one of ruprecht 20 . in principle , the radial density profile in fig .",
    "8 upper right panel shows a clean star density profile extending up to 4@xmath78 where it merges with the background star density .",
    "this fact suggests we are in the presence of a star overdensity .",
    "figure 10 , the cmds and tcd , show in turn a well defined star sequence proper of a relatively young open cluster because of the presence of several blue stars in the tcd ( middle panel ) .",
    "numbers ( our notation ) in the diagrams point out stars with spectral types .",
    "the superposition of the zams in the tcd yields average color excesses of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , a bit larger than earlier studies in table 5 but still , within 3@xmath81 , in agreement with vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) though quite far from the value found by kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in our interpretation ,",
    "our reddening value is more robust than previous ones since we can cover the cluster sequence till the second knee in the tcd , the scatter of the data is low in this diagram and the mean differences with vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) data are all quite acceptable .",
    "the fitting of the sk82 zams to the main sequence in the @xmath45 vs @xmath44 and @xmath45 vs @xmath43 diagrams yielded an absorption free distance modulus of @xmath82 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath83 kpc .",
    "this result is quite different from earlier values determined by vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) and kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for more that 1 kpc .",
    "so far as we can interpret the data the explanation for such a difference must be found in a simple fact already mentioned : our definition of the cluster in the tcd is very good and , in addition , we can track the cluster main sequence down to @xmath84 mag in the cmds .",
    "this means a larger range of apparent magnitudes that allows to achieve a better zams superimposition and therefore more precision in the cluster distance .",
    "the cluster age was derived by matching the girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) isochrones ( dashed lines in the cmds in fig . 10 ) .",
    "the best possible matches were achieved for ages between 63 and 80 million years ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "there is , as expected from the difference in distance between this work and earlier ones , a significant difference between our age value and the 117 million years from kharchenko et al .",
    "we think that the age difference found is closely related with our ability to locate precisely the cluster `` turn - off '' point at @xmath86 mag .",
    "in fact , that is why we differ from kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who derived the cluster parameters taking into account stars down to @xmath87  mag . certainly , since they had no opportunity to see this point their distance and age were weakly determined .",
    "spectral types in the region of ruprecht 47 include 8 bright stars listed in table 4 and pointed out in the corresponding panel of fig .",
    "three of them are of b - type , one , number 2 in our notation , is an emission b5ve star . because of the small @xmath88-value , vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) suggested it is an emission object that we confirm with our spectroscopy . inspecting distances shown in table 4 we conclude that none of these 8 stars with spectroscopic parallaxes have chances to become cluster members since they are , on the average , twice closer to the sun than the cluster ruprecht 47 situated at ( @xmath894 kpc ) .",
    "this negative result is very interesting since without a spectroscopic analysis most of the bright stars in this cluster would have been assumed cluster members .",
    "the astrophysical impact of such an error is clear ; it produces an over - estimation of the number of massive stars in the cluster head and severely modifies the cluster initial mass function value ( out of the scope of the our investigation ) .",
    "that is why spectroscopy is so valuable .",
    "now , it is obvious the presence of other blue stars in the tcd of ruprecht 47 and one may wonder how much field interlopers modify the cluster parameter .",
    "we do not know the answer but we have been as careful as possible in isolating the cluster region using star counts .",
    "this said , we shall assume as likely cluster members the other blue stars in ruprecht 47 until the contrary is demonstrated .",
    "another interesting result from the of spectroscopic parallaxes has to do with star 10 ( in our notation ) .",
    "this is a very early - type star , b1v , affected by an amount of reddening comparable to the rest of stars .",
    "but quite surprisingly , this object is a remote star located at almost 9.5 kpc from the sun .",
    "if our distance estimate is not wrong , this star becomes a serious candidate to be member of the innermost part of the outer arm .",
    "we discuss in section 5 the interpretation of this star in the framework of the nearby galaxy structure .",
    "ruprecht 60 has been studied by bonatto & bica ( 2010 ) through 2mass photometry using a decontamination algorithm developed by them .",
    "these authors stated the cluster is affected by a reddening over @xmath90 and placed it at a distance of more than 6 kpc .",
    "the age they found for ruprecht 60 is @xmath91 yr .",
    "this is the first time that @xmath0 photometry is undertaken in this overlooked object , probably , due to its weakness .",
    "in fact , images from the _ digital sky survey _ ( dss ) show an almost irrelevant group of faint stars concentrated in a small portion of the sky as seen in fig . 1 ( left middle panel ) . notwithstanding ,",
    "our photometry that reaches stars as faint as @xmath92 mag is quite concluding since the radial density profile shown in the middle left panel in fig .",
    "8 confirms it is a true open cluster .",
    "on the other hand , the extreme weakness of the brightest stars in this object ( they have magnitudes of @xmath93 ) precluded us from taking spectra in a reasonable amount of observing time .",
    "so , our analysis of this cluster rests upon photometric data alone .",
    "figure 11 shows the cmds @xmath69 , upper left panel , and the @xmath94 , upper right panel , of ruprecht 60 .",
    "the middle upper panel represents the corresponding tcd . in the lower left panel",
    "we show the @xmath95 cmd and in the lower right panel the @xmath96 color - color diagram .",
    "the @xmath70 tcd shows very few stars with @xmath97 inside the cluster area and therefore with the highest chances to be physically related to the cluster .",
    "we can fit these stars by shifting the intrinsic line by @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these values are , in our interpretation of the tcd , the most probable color excesses of ruprecht 60 .",
    "this is , we interpret there is no way the color excess of this cluster is @xmath100 as claimed by bonatto & bica ( 2010 ) .",
    "more interesting is the @xmath69 cmd where a tight cluster main sequence dominates in the range 15 mag @xmath101 19 mag .",
    "a worse isolation of this sequence is achieved in the @xmath102 cmd since the scatter of @xmath103 data is much more pronounced . in all the cmds",
    ", the @xmath69 and @xmath102 particularly , the cluster sequence shows evidences of evolution as stars leave the main sequence at @xmath104 mag .    since the color excess of the cluster turned out to be @xmath105 we compute the cluster distance by adjusting the sk82 zams in the cmds @xmath69 and @xmath71 achieving the best fit for an apparent distance modulus of @xmath106 .",
    "this corresponds to a true distance modulus of @xmath107 that places ruprecht 60 at a distance of @xmath108 kpc .",
    "the absorption law , that we use to get the absorption - free parameter above is @xmath52 as evidenced by fig .",
    "11 , lower right panel .",
    "a precise estimation of the age of clusters with some degree of evolution , as this is the case , is certainly complex in terms of the morphology of the turn - off point .",
    "in fact , as summarized in friel ( 1995 ) , the number of binary stars and blue stragglers in the field of old open clusters has important implications in interpreting the color - magnitude diagram and their comparison with theoretical models , since the morphology of the turn - off region is strongly affected by the presence of composite systems .",
    "when binary systems evolve through the turn - off region of single / simple stars , a color enlargement of the cmd diagram occurs near this point and the systems move toward larger luminosity than that of the true turn - off , before evolving into the region of red giants . apart from this ,",
    "many old open clusters show stars in the blue straggler region of the color - magnitude diagram , above and to the blue of the main sequence turnoff .",
    "radial velocity studies indicate that a significant number of stars found in this region are members of clusters and , among them , the spectroscopic binary frequency exceeds 40% [ milone ( 1992 ) , friel ( 1995 ) ] .",
    "the intersection of the evolutionary paths of single stars and binary systems creates thus a more complex color and luminosity distribution precisely in the region near the turn - off , where clarity is necessary in order to adjust the set of isochrones and determine the age based on the position of this point . in ruprecht 60",
    "cmds we do not see a potentially large number of candidates to blue straggler if any . as for the presence of binary systems",
    "there is nothing we can say since our observations were not designed for detecting this type of objects .",
    "therefore , and under the hypothesis that this cluster is solar metal content , the best fit for the set of isochrones by girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) yielded , after several tries , an age range between 800 and 1000 million years ( @xmath109 ) as shown in fig .",
    "our data analysis yielded results quite different from bonatto & bica ( 2010 ) .",
    "in fact , they have found , as seen in table 5 , a larger reddening and a larger distance ( almost 50% ) than ours . and , in terms of the cluster age , ours is larger by a factor of more than 2 . even though these authors applied a less personal method ( more sophisticated too ) to estimate cluster parameters , we interpret that these differences ( cluster size aside ) come from the use of @xmath110 2mass photometry .",
    "that is , getting the cluster reddening using @xmath111 photometry may lead to wrong results if one only rest on this photometry alone . as for the cluster age , the isochrone matching shown in their fig .",
    "5 is somewhat weak mainly because the cluster main sequence displays only 2 mag in @xmath112 . on the contrary ,",
    "our optical cmds show a more robust fitting not only because of the larger magnitude range but also because our isochrone matching follows pretty well the bend of the cluster main sequence .",
    "the first detailed study of ngc 2660 was carried out by hartwick & hesser ( 1973 ) by means of @xmath54 , @xmath113 and h@xmath88 photoelectric photometry and @xmath114 photographic photometry . since",
    "then several authors have studied this cluster as reported in table 5 .",
    "it is noticeable that through the years different authors with different techniques converge to a same @xmath46 color excess and the distance within the usual errors .",
    "the exception is the very discrepant value of @xmath115 kpc found by hesser & smith ( 1987 ) well above the mean of @xmath116 2.8 kpc .",
    "the situation is quite different in relation to the age of ngc 2660 that spans a range going from 0.7 to 1.7 gyr from one author to another .",
    "certainly , the critical point resides in the metal content of the cluster , a question that still remains open . since the purpose of our investigation excludes investigation of the metal content in ngc 2660 we rest onto the recent papers of sestito et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that concluded this cluster is solar metal content .    just for the sake of completeness we want to mention the most recent paper of sandrelli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on @xmath0 photometry who found a probable 30% population of binary stars in ngc 2660 .",
    "mlholt et al .",
    "( 2006 ) detected a number of @xmath117 scuti variable stars in this object .",
    "mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , in turn , included this cluster in their large survey for red giants in open clusters identifying six members .",
    "the radial density profile of ngc 2660 , right middle panel in fig .",
    "8 , shows a strong star density covering a radius of 6 arcmin ( 2mass data ) that emerges above a quite flat star field .",
    "our survey is therefore covering the very nuclear cluster zone . in fig .",
    "12 we show the cmds @xmath69 , upper left panel , and the @xmath71 , upper right panel .",
    "the middle upper panel shows the @xmath70 tcd .",
    "the lower left panel is the @xmath102 cmd and the lower right panel is the @xmath96 color - color diagram .",
    "the tcd , like in ruprecht 60 , is very useful to give a reasonable approximation to the true color excess affecting ngc 2660 , even if there are no blue - type stars .",
    "the best zams shifting in the tcd is for @xmath118 , a value slightly lesser than previous estimates reported in table 5 but still in good agreement with the historical mean for ngc 2660 .",
    "the cmds show a very well populated cluster main sequence with a well defined turn - off .",
    "the data scatter along the main sequence seen in the @xmath119 and @xmath102 is relatively little what suggests , in our opinion , that contamination for field interlopers is low .    in the @xmath69 and @xmath102 cmds of fig .",
    "8 we show the zams of sk82 fitted with an apparent distance modulus @xmath120 and the above mentioned @xmath46 . since the @xmath96 color - color diagram ( lower right panel in fig .",
    "8) confirms that the absorption law @xmath52 is completely valid in this region the absorption free distance modulus is @xmath121 that places ngc 2660 at a distance @xmath122 kpc .",
    "this value agrees with those found in the literature ( see table 5 ) .",
    "a dominant feature in all the cmds of ngc 2660 is the compact red clump at @xmath123 , also noticeable in the tcd at @xmath124 and @xmath125 . adopting the same temperament as in the case of the turn - off point of ruprecht 60 we proceed to estimate the age of the cluster looking for the best set of isochrones embracing not only the turn - off point stars but also the evident red clump .",
    "again , assuming the cluster s metallicity is solar , and by making use of girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) set of isochrones , we find that the best fit corresponds to the age interval @xmath126 .",
    "particularly good is the isochrones fitting in the @xmath71 cmd .",
    "notwithstanding , the red clump of this cluster raises some controversy since we could only fit simultaneously the cluster turn - off and the red clump stars in the @xmath102 cmd . in the other two cmds",
    "we note the clump looks blue - shifted and becomes impossible to fit for an isochrone .",
    "this effect has been noticed too in earlier works and that raised the controversy about the metal content of stars in this cluster .",
    "photometry is unable to resolve the controversy .",
    "just for the sake of curiosity we have made several attempts using different metal content isochrones without achieving a satisfactory result . clearly a profound spectroscopic analysis is needed in ngc 2660 .",
    "mk types for stars in this cluster reported in table 4 are illustrative in terms of comparing reddening and distance derived from photometry with the same data from spectroscopy alone .",
    "data in table 4 shows @xmath46 values ranging from 0.18 to 0.72 ( only one star with this extreme value ) while most stars have reddening values near the mean of 0.33 .",
    "looking at individual star distances with mk types in ngc 2660 , we conclude that most of them are in front of the cluster at more than 0.5 kpc from it .",
    "these stars are 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 14 , 19 , 44 , 80 , 100 and 110 .",
    "photometric arguments ( the location of these stars in the photometric diagrams in fig .",
    "12 ) favor that a number of them are not members directly or have low chances to be related to the cluster .",
    "two stars , 8 and 61 are farther than the cluster distance ; the star 61 is otherwise bad located in the photometric diagrams .",
    "we draw the attention to star 8 , a b8iii placed at a distance @xmath127 kpc .",
    "we will return to this star in the next section .",
    "star 1 has a chance , from a spectroscopic point of view , to be a likely member ; however , its position in the photometric diagrams excludes it .",
    "stars 99 and 7 are relatively close to the cluster distance . in the case of star 7 , and given its location near the turn - off , it becomes a potential blue straggler star . like in ruprecht 47 a large number of stars with mk types turned out to be non members .",
    "this fact permits us to throw away field interlopers with confidence and get clean diagrams of the cluster .",
    "there is no influence of interlopers on the cluster parameters since these latter depend on the turn - off location and the red clump .",
    "there is no influence of interlopers on the cluster parameters since these latter rely on the location of the turn - off and the red clump .",
    "available information in the literature suggests ngc 2910 is a young open cluster .",
    "it has been previously studied by becker ( 1960 ) , topaktas ( 1981 ) , ramsay & pollaco ( 1992 ) and kharchenko et al .",
    "becker and topaktas made use of the same data set ( the becker ( 1960 ) one ) founding a large number of members amongst the bright stars in the zone . however , the deeper ccd photometric survey carried out by ramsay & pollaco ( 1992 , 1994 ) could only find 12 members .",
    "kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) revisited this cluster finding only 9 probable members .",
    "evidently there are difficulties in understanding the upper main sequence of ngc 2910 that could be easily solved by undertaking a vigorous spectroscopic program .",
    "although we have few stars with spectroscopy in this cluster we hope we can improve the knowledge of the region as we show below .",
    "despite our photometric survey includes a large portion of the cluster surface it is still insufficient to cover the entire cluster given its radial extension ( see fig . 4 lower panel ) .",
    "photometric diagrams in fig .",
    "13 show an extended cluster main sequence down to @xmath128 mag with very low scatter around the mean location .",
    "contamination by field interlopers is not dramatic and the cluster appears clean against the star background . as for the cluster main sequence it appears affected by a uniform reddening value that we estimate @xmath129 and show in fig .",
    "13 middle upper panel .",
    "this value disagrees with previous reports found in the literature and indicated in table 5 .",
    "our reddening is more than twice the found for some authors but kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who found @xmath130 quite unrealistic from the tcd in the middle upper panel in fig . 13 .",
    "we applied the same procedures used in the other clusters in this sample to derive the corresponding distance .",
    "the superposition of the sk82 zams in the @xmath69 and @xmath71 cmds has been done for a distance modulus @xmath131 . after correcting for visual absorption , taking into account that",
    "the extinction law is the standard one ( see fig . 13 , lower right panel ) , the distance of ngc 2910 from the sun turns out to be @xmath40 kpc a coincident value with earlier findings .",
    "again we have a large discrepancy with kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who found 2.6 kpc .    as for the age of the cluster",
    "we find a single isochrone able to fit the entire main sequence .",
    "this is the @xmath132 for an age of 63 myr .",
    "that is , from our data analysis , the cluster is a little bit older than earlier estimates .",
    "mk types for ngc 2910 in table 4 leave only three stars with chances to be cluster members ; they are stars 1 and 2 of evolved b - types and star 6 , another b - type star .",
    "the other two stars , 4 and 5 in our notation , are not members of the cluster .",
    "they are too of b - types , one of late b - type and the other is a peculiar b - type star . the remaining star with mk - types in ngc 2910 is a background f - type star .",
    "we finally show in fig .",
    "14 the path of @xmath46 against the distance for all the stars and clusters in the present sample .",
    "the upper panel includes stars with mk types in the field of clusters ruprecht 20 and in ruprecht 47 .",
    "the position of ruprecht 47 is indicated . in the lower panel",
    "we do the same for ruprecht 60 ngc 2660 and ngc 2910 .",
    "following well known relations that state that @xmath133 we compare our reddening estimations with the findings of kaltcheva & hilditch ( 2000 ) . for both regions under analysis ,",
    "@xmath134 and @xmath135 the reddening values are entirely in agreement .",
    "the presence of some patches of dust may be responsible for the couple of nearby stars in fig .",
    "14 , in both zones , showing high reddening values .",
    "ruprecht 20 and ruprecht 47 stars show different reddening behavior probably due to the fact that ruprecht 47 is located along the galactic plane ( steadily increasing ) while ruprecht 20 is at more than 5 degrees below the plane ( quite flat ) .",
    "one of the clusters in our sample is ruprecht 20 that we have already shown it is not a physical entity .",
    "this object is projected against the north of the vela gum in a region also known as puppis association .",
    "the other cluster in our survey also in puppis is ruprecht 47 ( in the limit with pyxis constellation ) .",
    "puppis is an intricate zone with a stellar structure hard to elucidate .",
    "humphrey ( 1978 ) found various components of what is designated as puppis ob1 association at 2.5 kpc from the sun , while havlen ( 1976 ) had , a little before , reported a second , more distant association , puppis ob2 at 4.3 kpc .",
    "however , the existence of these two separate associations have been questioned by kaltcheva & hilditch ( 2000 ) , who could not find evidences of them .",
    "actually , these authors suggested the presence in the same galaxy direction of two other star groups ( at 1 kpc the first , and 3.2 kpc the second ) , but significantly lower in latitude , at @xmath136 .",
    "these two young star groups would surround , in projection , the star cluster ngc 2439 , located at 3.5 - 4.5 kpc from the sun ( see fig . 6 in kaltcheva & hilditch ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "ruprecht 20 is situated a little below this last location and we found two stars , numbers 10 and 3 in our notation , of b8v and b9v spectral types in the field of this object at distances of @xmath116 2.5 and @xmath116 2.0 kpc respectively . within distance errors of the order of 15 - 20% as indicated in subsection 3.3 these stars are placed in front of the stellar aggregate 2 proposed by kaltcheva & hilditch ( 2000 ) making this stellar group a long structure extending from 2 to 4 kpc from the sun .",
    "ruprecht 47 is placed well along the galactic plane at a distance @xmath137 kpc .",
    "it becomes therefore clearly coincident with puppis ob2 at 4.3 kpc according to havlen ( 1976 ) assertion and the genetic connection with puppis ob2 is supported by its age ( less than 100 myr ) .",
    "it is to mention that not far from the position of ruprecht 47 there exists the open cluster haffner 20 ( @xmath138 ,  @xmath139 ) with similar age ( carraro et al . 2015 ) and at a distance of 5.5 kpc in the conjunction with the perseus arm .",
    "it seems , therefore , that puppis ob2 may extend farther , even much more than previously indicated in the literature .",
    "table 4 informs as well the existence of two b - type stars in the field of ruprecht 47 , one b1v and the other b5ve at distances of 2.0 and 2.2 kpc respectively .",
    "if we follow the humphreys ( 1978 ) discussion these two stars belong to puppis ob1 .",
    "connecting our findings with those of kaltcheva & hilditch ( 2000 ) it seems that early type stars in puppis constellation , including puppis ob1 and ob2 and regions 1 and 2 from kaltcheva & hilditch compose a sort of thickening ( maybe a bridge ) of the galactic disk of about 300 pc at 2 - 3 kpc from the sun extending outward up to 6 kpc .    in the background of ruprecht 47",
    "there is another star , number 10 in our notation and classified b1v , placed at the huge distance of @xmath140 kpc .",
    "this is a surprising finding since this distance implies we have detected a young stellar component of the innermost side of the outer arm .",
    "this star is very distant no matter the data set adopted . indeed",
    "if we compute its spectroscopic parallax with data from vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) the distance from the sun would be of the order of 10 kpc .",
    "ngc 2660 and ngc 2910 are two clusters placed in the vel ob1 association . according to humphreys ( 1978 ) the nucleus of the association is placed at 1.8 kpc from the sun .",
    "the cluster ngc 2660 is not subject of a discussion of this type in terms of its belonging to vel ob1 since the age , around 1 gyr , excludes it .",
    "however , there is another star , 8 in our notation , classified b8iii and placed at @xmath141 kpc from the sun .",
    "we discuss below the meaning of this star . as for ngc 2910 ,",
    "its distance of 1.3 kpc makes it a sure member of the vel ob1 association and therefore a member of the local arm . in the cluster field",
    "there are also two stars , 4 and 5 , b5vp and b7iii , at @xmath142 kpc from the sun respectively , that are likely members of the vela ob1 association .",
    "figure 15 is the x - y projection of the tgq showing the position of clusters and young stars analyzed in the present study .",
    "the picture in fig .",
    "15 is complementary of similar ones we have recently shown in carraro et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and enlarges the available information by including more clusters and stars in puppis and vela associations .",
    "15 and figs . 1 and 12 in carraro et al .",
    "( 2015 ) show the presence of a large number of blue stars and several young clusters composing a sort of stellar bridge between the perseus arm and the sun position covering from @xmath143 to @xmath144 in galactic longitude .",
    "that is , the young stellar population we have found with spectroscopy forms part of the local arm in the tgq , strictly speaking in vela and puppis associations . ngc 2910 is a young object member of the local arm and close to the border of the third and fourth galactic quadrants .",
    "probably this cluster is one of the farthest member of the local arm in the direction to vela .",
    "the cluster ruprecht 47 is also young and is placed close to the formal galactic plane .",
    "so , we understand that this object is a likely member of the perseus arm ( or a very distant member of puppis ob2 in the local arm ) . as for the blue star , number 8 , in the background of ngc 2660 it may be a member of the local arm though it is still possible for it to become one of the innermost members of the perseus arm .",
    "15 shows the location of another remote blue star , number 10 , seen in the background of ruprecht 47 at 9.5 kpc from the sun .",
    "we have already commented above that this star may become member of the innermost part of the outer arm .",
    "nevertheless , what makes this object a singular star is its location along the galactic plane .",
    "in fact , at @xmath145 the warp is quite pronounced ( vzquez et al . 2008 ) but some young open clusters as haffner 18 and haffner 19 and blue stars in the background of haffner 21 and trumpler 9 can be found ( see carraro et al .",
    "gathering all this information we interpret that the presence of this very remote young star in the galactic plane is not an isolated fact but it is a strong indication that the galactic thin disk is not only warped , but also flared , like the thick disk .",
    "quite recently , xu et al ( 2013 ) have presented evidences of a large number of star formation regions with trigonometric parallaxes that extend the local arm back to the first galactic quadrant .",
    "xu et al . (",
    "2013 ) stated also a series of questions ( not answered yet ) concerning the interpretation of the local arm : 1.- it is a branch of the perseus arm , 2.- it is part of a major arm or 3.- it is an independent spiral arm segment .",
    "unfortunately , we can not speculate about the nature of the local arm because our observations were designed just to establish the existence and the spatial distribution of young objects in the tgq",
    ". more observations ( photometry and spectroscopy ) for a precise estimation of cluster parameters are needed in order to reach a plausible answer to these questions from an optical point of view . meanwhile , a comparison of our fig . 15 with their fig .",
    "10 reveals that our findings are in good agreement with theirs in terms of the distribution of young population throughout the local arm in tgq .",
    "we presented in this article the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey carried out in five cluster located at @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "this region comprises mostly the vela gum region and includes part of the puppis association .",
    "one of our clusters , ruprecht 60 , has been studied with @xmath54 photometry for the first time and its parameters are now improved .",
    "other of the clusters , ruprecht 20 , is not a cluster since neither from star counts used to construct its radial density profile nor from the photometric diagrams we can conclude that it is a true entity .",
    "it is just a random stellar fluctuation .      from the point of view of identification of large stellar structures in this portion of the galaxy",
    "we have found evidences that favor the presence in puppis , at @xmath148 , of a sort of bridge connecting two regions defined by kaltcheva & hilditch ( 2000 ) .",
    "ruprecht 47 is definitely a member of puppis ob2 and in its field we also found two blue stars related with puppis ob1 .",
    "ngc 2910 becomes member of vel ob1 and also a couple of blue stars with no relation to ngc 2910 .      as for two peculiar isolated stars we report the presence of a very distant star seen against the field of ruprecht 47 placed at almost 10 kpc from the sun .",
    "ruprecht 47 is along the formal galactic plane ( @xmath149 ) and this remote star in the background may belong to the innermost part of the outer arm .",
    "another interesting star has been found in the field of ngc 2660 at near 5.7 kpc from the sun .",
    "this star could be member of the innermost part of the perseus arm or a far member of the local arm .",
    "as for the grand design structures in the tgq we are in the position to confirm the angular extension of the local arm from @xmath150 to @xmath151 .",
    "our findings are in good agreement with previous studies ( see carraro et al .",
    "2015 ) we have already performed in the sense that our evidences indicate that the galactic plane is not only warped but also flared .",
    "this is , thin disk population shows a pattern similar to the shown by the thick disk .",
    "moreover , there is a good spatial agreement with xu et al .",
    "( 2013 ) findings . finally , the kind of observations we performed do not allow to speculate about the nature of the local arm but our evidences -collected in several papers as indicated in section 1 and concerning",

    "<S> they are ruprecht 20 , ruprecht 47 , ruprecht 60 , ngc 2660 and ngc 2910 . </S>",
    "<S> we could improve / confirm the parameters of these objects derived before . </S>",
    "<S> ruprecht 20 is not a real physical entity , in agreement with earlier suggestions . </S>",
    "<S> ruprecht 47 , a young cluster in the galactic plane , at 4.4 kpc from the sun is quite farther than in previous distance estimations and becomes , therefore , a member of the puppis ob2 association . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time ruprecht 60 was surveyed in @xmath0 photometry . </S>",
    "<S> we found it to be placed at 4.2 kpc from the sun of about and 1 gyr old . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 2660 is another old object in our survey for which distance and age are coincident with previous findings . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 2910 turns out to be a young cluster of vela ob1 association at a distance of 1.4 kpc approximately and 60 myr old . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic parallax method has been applied to several stars located in the fields of four out of the five clusters to get their distances and reddenings . with this method we found two blue stars in the field of ngc 2910 at distances that make them likely members of vela ob1 too . </S>",
    "<S> also , projected against the fields of ruprecht 20 and ruprecht 47 we have detected other young stars favoring not only the existence of puppis ob1 and ob2 but conforming a young stellar group at @xmath1 kpc from the sun and extending for more than 6 kpc outward the galaxy . if this is the case , there is a thickening of the thin galactic disk of more than 300 pc at just 2 - 3 kpc from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> ruprecht 60 and ngc 2660 are too old objects that have no physical relation with the associations under discussion . </S>",
    "<S> an astonishing result has been the detection in the background of ruprecht 47 of a young star at the impressive distance of 9.5 kpc from the sun that could be a member of the innermost part of the outer arm . </S>",
    "<S> another far young star in the field of ngc 2660 , at near 6.0 kpc , may become a probable member of the perseus arm or of the inner part of the local arm . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of young clusters and stars onto the third galactic quadrant agrees with recent findings concerning the extension of the local arm as revealed by parallaxes of regions of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we show evidences too that added to previous ones found by our group explain the thickening of the thin disk as a combination of flare and warp .    </S>",
    "<S> open clusters and associations : general , milky way : structure , galactic spiral arms </S>"
