    "about a decade ago , the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect in doped manganites caused a surge of interest in these perovskite oxides  @xcite .",
    "the particular physical properties of the cmr materials are related to the fact that their parent compound lamno@xmath0 contains mn@xmath3 ions with 4 electrons in its @xmath4-shell . on the one hand , the presence of these jahn - teller active ions leads to a strong coupling between the electrons and the lattice , giving rise to polaron formation which is widely perceived to be essential for the cmr effect  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when doped , the @xmath5 high spin state leads via the double exchange mechanism to a ferromagnetic metallic state with a large magnetic moment making the system easily susceptible to externally applied magnetic fields  @xcite . moreover",
    "the presence of strong electron correlations and an orbital degree of freedom , to which the jahn - teller effect is directly related , leads to an extraordinary rich phase diagram at higher doping concentration , displaying a wealth of spin , charge , orbital and magnetically ordered phases  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the high spin @xmath5 state of mn@xmath3 is intimately related to a plethora of physical phases , effects and properties .",
    "however , it is important to note that the high spin @xmath5 state is _ not _ exclusive to trivalent manganese .",
    "formally high spin cr@xmath6 is electronically equivalent to mn@xmath3 .",
    "however , divalent chromium due to its low ionization potential is rarely found in solid state systems , making kcrf@xmath0 an intriguing example .",
    "recently , we characterized in detail the temperature - dependent crystallographic phase diagram of kcrf@xmath0 revealing strong structural , electronic , and magnetic similarities with lamno@xmath0  @xcite , including the presence of jahn - teller distortions and orbital ordering , and orbital melting at high temperature . here",
    "we report _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations on the different phases of this compound , both within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and the lsda+u , in which local electron correlation effects are partially accounted for .",
    "the results of our calculations clearly show that kcrf@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 are not only structurally , but also electronically very similar .     at high temperature .",

    "schematic representation of the low temperature monoclinic structure with crf@xmath7 octahedra elongated along the ( 1 - 10 ) ( blue ) and ( 001 ) ( red ) directions ]    kcrf@xmath0 displays three different crystallographic structures , see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] . at very high temperatures ,",
    "the system is a cubic perovskite ( space group _ pm-3",
    "m _ )  @xcite .",
    "below 973 k , the jt - active high spin cr@xmath6 ion induces a lattice distortion to a body - centered tetragonal unit cell ( space group _ i4/mcm _ ) , isostructural to the cu@xmath6 analogue , kcuf@xmath0 . in the tetragonal phase ,",
    "the crf@xmath7 octahedra are distorted , leading to short cr - f bonds along the @xmath8 axis and alternating long - short cr - f bonds in the @xmath9 plane , indicative of the presence of a staggered type of orbital ordering .",
    "on cooling below the 250 k , there is a phase transition to a more complicated monoclinic structure with space group _ i2/m_.    from our density functional calculations we find that the tetragonal phase of kcrf@xmath0 is a strongly correlated insulator with a gap of 0.49 ev in lsda and 2.48 ev in lsda+u ( with @xmath10 ev ) .",
    "for this value of @xmath11 , the calculated relaxed lattice structure is in excellent agreement with the experimental one . in the tetragonal orbitally - ordered phase we find a crystal - field splitting between the cr @xmath12 and @xmath13 states is 1.0 ev and a total energy gain related to the jahn - teller splitting of the @xmath13 states of 0.328 ev per formula unit containing four chromium ions .",
    "the cooperative jahn - teller distortion is accompanied by a - type antiferromagnetic spin ordering in a similar fashion to lamno@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we find a magnetic moment of @xmath14 @xmath15 per cr@xmath6 ion , in excellent agreement with experiment  @xcite and in - plane and out - of - plane superexchange parameters of 2.6 mev and -3.4 mev , respectively .",
    "the system displays antiferrodistortive ordering of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals in the @xmath9 plane an ordering motif very different from the orbital ordering in kcuf@xmath0 that gives rise to a quasi one - dimensional spin chain formation , and rather resembling the orbital ordering in lamno@xmath0  @xcite . along the @xmath8 axis",
    ", the orbital ordering pattern in kcrf@xmath0 is rotated by @xmath18 degrees in consecutive layers .",
    "this in contrast to the manganite where the ordering along the @xmath8 axis is a uniform repetition of the in - plane orbital structure .",
    "another difference with lamno@xmath0 is that the @xmath13 bandwidth in the chromium compound , as computed within lsda , is about a factor of two smaller .",
    "however , this is compensated in lsda+u , which shows a bandwidth of the lower hubbard @xmath13 band of 2.1 ev .    [ fig1 ]    on cooling below the 250 k",
    ", kcrf@xmath0 shows a phase transition to a more complicated monoclinic structure ( space group _ i2/m _ ) with four chromium atoms in the unit cell .",
    "our calculations show that in the monoclinic phase an a - type magnetic structure is also realized and that the jahn - teller energy is lowered , leading to an even stronger orbital ordering .",
    "however , the resulting electronic gap and magnetic moment of the compound barely change .    in the following we will present the electronic structure calculations for the three different crystallographic structures .",
    "for each one , we considered several possible magnetic ordering structures ( ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic of a , g , and c - type ) and analyzed the resulting electronic properties , jahn - teller energies and orbital orderings .",
    "the structural changes which occur on lowering the temperature below 973 k through the cubic - to - tetragonal phase transition can be described in terms of two components : a uniform @xmath19-type tetragonal distortion , which shortens one lattice constant ( along the @xmath8 direction ) and lengthens the other two ( along the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions ) and a @xmath22-type staggered distortion , which introduces alternating cr - f bond lengths in the @xmath9 plane with two distinct cr - f bonds of @xmath23  .",
    "this is a textbook example of a cooperative jahn - teller distortion .",
    "the lattice parameters of the resulting body - centered tetragonal unit cell at room temperature are @xmath20= 6.05230   and @xmath8= 8.02198   @xcite .",
    "all our self - consistent calculations are done within lsda and lsda+u using the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite .",
    "total energies for the tetragonal structure were calculated with a kinetic cutoff energy of @xmath24 ev and the tetrahedron with blochl correction , using @xmath25 irreducible k - points .",
    "we start our study of the tetragonal structure of kcrf@xmath0 at the lsda level and then proceed to also include local correlations within lsda+u .",
    "we find that the a - type antiferromagnetic spin ordered structure is the ground state . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the band structure and the ( projected ) density of states are shown .",
    "the system is insulating with an energy gap of @xmath26 ev , which is induced by the jahn - teller splitting of the @xmath13 states . in accordance with hund",
    "s rule , the cr@xmath6 ions are in a high spin @xmath27 state , giving rise to a magnetic moment of @xmath28 @xmath15 per cr .",
    "the fermi level lies just above the bands with @xmath12 and @xmath13 character , in agreement with the high spin state of the cr ions .",
    "the exchange splitting is about @xmath29 ev , which moves the minority - spin bands far above the fermi level .",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath13 crystal field splitting , @xmath30 is about @xmath31 ev .",
    "the occupied cr bands show little dispersion along the @xmath32 direction and are therefore of quasi - two - dimensional character , which is due to the specific ordering of the @xmath13 orbitals that maximizes hybridization in - plane and minimizes the out - of - plane dispersion .",
    "the character of occupied @xmath13 bands is mixed between the two types of @xmath13 states but is mainly coming from @xmath33 orbitals on neighboring cr ions .",
    "this becomes immediately clear from the contour plot of charge density corresponding to the @xmath13 bands below the fermi level , shown in fig .",
    "the orbital ordering is found to be staggered along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the unoccupied orbitals have @xmath34 and @xmath35 character , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 projected density of states resolved for orbital character shows that the @xmath36 states have a different distribution in energy from the two - fold degenerate orbitals of @xmath37 character , in agreement with crystal field symmetry expectations .",
    "the band width of the @xmath12 bands is @xmath38 ev , while the jahn - teller split @xmath39 bands just below and above the fermi level each have a width of about 0.65 ev , almost a factor of two smaller than the value of 1.2 ev in lamno@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "however , the inclusion of local correlations within lsda+u changes this bandwidth significantly .",
    "it is well known that the incorporation of local coulomb interactions is essential to understand the physical properties of transition metal compounds  @xcite . in lsda+u",
    "the electron - electron interaction is dealt with on a meanfield level and we repeated the lsda calculations above within this scheme .",
    "we performed calculations for a series of values of the on - site coulomb parameter @xmath11 , namely @xmath40 ev , adopting a value for hund s exchange of @xmath41 ev . in practice the exact definition of @xmath11 in a solid",
    "is not trivial .",
    "the value that is found for this parameter depends on for instance the precise choice of the orbitals that are used in the calculation  @xcite . in order to determine its value",
    ", we performed a structural optimization as a function of @xmath11 and subsequently stay with the value for @xmath11 for which we find an equilibrium structure that matches the experimental one .",
    "this scheme to extract the coulomb parameter is viable because the on - site hubbard @xmath11 determines for a large part the orbital polarization of the @xmath13 states , which in turn causes the structural jahn - teller lattice distortion  @xcite .",
    "hund s exchange parameter @xmath42 , in contrast , represents a local multipole and is only very weakly screened in the solid and therefore close to its bare atomic value . for it",
    "we used the value for a high spin @xmath5 configuration determined by constrained density functional calculations  @xcite . at any rate small changes of @xmath42",
    "will not affect the results of lsda+u significantly , as @xmath11 is the dominating parameter .",
    ".energy difference ( ev ) between the magnetic ground state ( a - type ) and other magnetic orderings , band gap @xmath43 ( ev ) and magnetic moment ( @xmath44 ) of the cr - ions in kcrf@xmath0 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to determine @xmath11 we optimized the three inequivalent cr - f distances in the tetragonal unit cell , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while fixing the lattice parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath8 by minimizing the total energy .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2_bis ] . for @xmath48",
    "ev we find that the computed structure is very close to the one obtained experimentally , motivating us to adopt this value as the most reliable one .",
    "the obtained @xmath11 value agrees well with that for mn@xmath49 in lamno@xmath0 ( 8.0 ev )  @xcite calculated within a constrained lda+u scheme . in kcuf@xmath0 a value of 7.5 ev is similarly found for cu@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "as one expects that the ionic core potential of cr@xmath6 causes the @xmath4 electrons to be less localized with respect to both examples above , it is reasonable to find the smaller value of @xmath48 ev for kcrf@xmath0 .",
    "below 46 k antiferromagnetic spin ordering is observed  @xcite . to study the magnetic exchange couplings between the cr ions we calculated the total energy of various magnetic structures .",
    "the different magnetic structures we considered are : a - type ( the spins are parallel in the @xmath9 planes and the spins are antiparallel along the @xmath8-axis ) , f - type ( all spins parallel ) , c - type ( each spin is antiparallel to all others in the @xmath9 plane but parallel along the @xmath8-axis ) , and g - type ( every spin is antiparallel to all its neighbours ) .    from the computations we find that the ground state is a - type spin ordered for all values of @xmath11 .",
    "the difference in energies between the various magnetically ordered structures for lsda and lsda+u is reported in table  [ diffenergy ] . from these total energies it is possible to calculate the exchange constants : we find @xmath50 mev , while @xmath51 mev for lsda+u ( @xmath48 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "these quantities can be compared with the exchange constants of lamno@xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath52 mev and @xmath53 mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the resulting band structure and density of states for the tetragonal structure of kcrf@xmath0 within lsda+u ( @xmath48 and @xmath54 ev ) are shown .",
    "the lsda band gap of @xmath55 ev increases to a value of 2.479 ev ( @xmath11=6.0 ev ) , see table  [ diffenergy ] .    from the projected density of states we see that within lsda+u around the fermi level there is a clean distribution of the @xmath13 states",
    "@xmath56/@xmath57 , depending on the cr - site .",
    "a concomitant enhancement of the orbital polarization is visible in the contour plot of the charge density of the occupied @xmath13 bands , see fig .",
    "this plot also shows that there is an increase in hybrization between the cr @xmath13 states and fluoride @xmath58 states which enhances the total band width of the occupied cr @xmath59 @xmath13 bands to about @xmath60 ev .",
    "the two - dimensional character of the occupied @xmath13 bands does not change in the lsda+u treatment , but the dispersion of the empty @xmath13 states comes to the fore more clearly . from the computations on the cubic phase in the next section it will be particularly clear that the two - dimensional character of the occupied @xmath13 bands that is caused by the orbital ordering is also the driving force behind the a - type magnetic ordering , as can be expected on the basis of the goodenough - kanamori  @xcite rules for superexchange .",
    "in the cubic @xmath61 structure ( @xmath62  )  @xcite , the distances between all cr and neighboring f - ions are equal to 2.116   and the @xmath13 states are locally degenerate . we find that at the lsda level , cubic kcrf@xmath0 is metallic , for the groundstate a - type magnetic structure . such is expected as in the absence of a jahn - teller distortion the @xmath13 band is half filled , even though it is fully spin polarized .    in lsda+u",
    "a bandgap of 1.72 ev opens up the band structures calculated by lsda+u ( @xmath48 and @xmath54 ev ) with the cubic unit cell with a - type magnetic ordering is shown in  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the correlation - induced mott gap is smaller than the charge gap in the tetragonal structure because of the absence of the jahn - teller distortion .    despite the fact that the jahn - teller distortions are absent in this structure ,",
    "there is still an orbital ordering which is due to the magnetic exchange , see fig .",
    "this exchange - driven orbital ordering can be understood in terms of the orbital dependence of the superexchange energy between neighboring cr - sites .",
    "such a situation is described in terms of a kugel - khomskii model  @xcite . for the a - type magnetic",
    "ordering we obtain a homogeneous orbital occupation of @xmath63 states , oriented perpendicular to the ferromagnetic plane .",
    "this is in accordance with the goodenough - kanamori  @xcite rules for superexchange : bonds of occupied @xmath63 orbitals on top of each other have a large overlap and therefore result in antiferromagnetic spin ordering . within the plane",
    "the overlap is mainly between occupied @xmath63 and empty @xmath64 orbitals , causing a ferromagnetic orientation of the spins .    when we consider c - type magnetic ordering the resulting orbital ordering ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) is of the homogeneous @xmath64 type again with antiferromagnetic spin orientation for orbitals with lobes pointing towards each other ( @xmath64 orbitals in the plane ) and ferromagnetic orientation between orbitals with small overlap .",
    "the a- and c - type order that we considered are just two of many possible magnetic orderings with concomitant orbital orderings : other configurations can appear when the unit cell is doubled or quadrupled in accordance with model calculations on the kugel - khomskii hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "these observations of magnetically driven orbital ordering ( or orbitally driven magnetic ordering , depending on one s point of view ) , although interesting from a theoretical perspective , are not directly relevant to the experimental situation as at the high temperatures where the cubic phase is stable no long range magnetic ordering is expected .    by comparing the total energies of the cubic and tetragonal phases in the paramagnetic state we can directly compute the energy gain in the tetragonal phase that is due to the jahn - teller distortion alone .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath65 ev per unit formula , which is comparable to that found in lamno@xmath0 ( 0.504 ev )  @xcite .",
    "below 250 k , kcrf@xmath0 shows a phase transition to a monoclinic structure , characterized by a pronounced tilting of the crf@xmath7 octahedra .",
    "the lattice parameters at 150 k are @xmath66  , @xmath67  , @xmath68   and @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "we performed the total energies calculations with a kinetic cutoff energy of @xmath24 ev and used the tetrahedron method with blochl correction , using @xmath18 irreducible k - points .",
    "the total energy that we compute in the monoclinic phase reveals that the jahn - teller distortion is further stabilized with an energy gain of @xmath70 mev per cr with respect to the tetragonal phase . again in the lsda+u calculations the magnetic groundstate is found to be a - type , the cr moment is @xmath71 , the band gap @xmath72 ev and the orbital ordering is essentially the same as in the tetragonal phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) . per unit formula the ferromagnetic configuration is higher in energy by @xmath73 ev , the c - type configuration by @xmath74 ev and the g - type state by @xmath75 ev . from this",
    "we find slightly larger in - plane and inter - plane magnetic couplings of @xmath76 mev and @xmath77 mev , respectively .",
    "similar to lamno@xmath0@xcite , experimentally a small spin canting is observed , giving rise to weak ferromagnetism in the monoclinic phase  @xcite . when the cuf@xmath7 octahedra are tilted the weak local anisotropy and non - local dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction lead to spin canting . in a first principles bandstructure calculation , this can be taken into account when on top of the present computation scheme the relativistic spin - orbit interaction is included  @xcite .",
