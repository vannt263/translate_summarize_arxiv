    "the results presented here are based on a data sample collected with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath3 collider  @xcite .",
    "the experiment is located at the high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) in tsukuba , japan .",
    "electrons and positrons are being collided at the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of about 10.58  gev , corresponding to the mass of the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the main objective of the belle experiment is a study of the @xmath5 violation in the @xmath6 meson system produced from @xmath4 , however a large data sample collected with the belle detector and its excellent performance also make possible to perfrom searches for new hadronic states as well as studies of their properties .",
    "there are several possible mechanisms of the particle production at @xmath6 factories : production in the @xmath6 meson decays , fragmentation of quarks in @xmath3 annihilation or two - photon collisions .",
    "most of the newly discovered states , the so - called @xmath0 mesons , almost certainly contain a @xmath7 quark pair among their constituent particles but do not fit into any of the unassigned charmonium levels predicted within the potential models . as a result , they are considered to be possible candidates for new , exotic types of particles such as multiquark states that include either molecular states ( two loosely bound charm mesons ( @xmath8)(@xmath9 ) ) @xcite , or tetraquarks ( tightly bound four - quark states , [ @xmath8][@xmath9 ] ) @xcite , charmonium hybrids ( @xmath7-gluon with excited gluonic degrees of freedom )  @xcite , or hadro - charmonium ( compact charmonium states , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , `` coated '' by excited light - hadron matter )  @xcite .",
    "more conservative models @xcite suggest to reconsider the effect of the numerous open charm thresholds which are located in many cases near the new states on the parameters of the conventional charmonium levels .    in this paper we review review recent results from belle collaboration on the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 charmoniumlike meson states as well as on their possible counterparts in @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems , summarized also in table  [ tab_newstates ] .",
