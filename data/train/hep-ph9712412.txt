    "the search for supersymmetric particles plays an important rle at lep2 and tevatron",
    ". it will play an even more important rle at the future colliders lhc , an @xmath3 linear collider with an energy range up to 2  tev , and a @xmath0 collider with an energy range up to 4  tev .",
    "we assume that at the time when a @xmath0 collider starts operation , supersymmetry will have been discovered at tevatron or lhc . while proton colliders are good discovery machines @xcite , one can do precision measurements at @xmath0 colliders @xcite .",
    "another exciting feature of a @xmath0 collider is the possibility of producing higgs bosons in the s ",

    "this allows one to measure various higgs couplings at the higgs resonances .    in the following",
    "our framework is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "the mssm implies the existence of five physical higgs bosons : two scalars @xmath4 , one pseudoscalar @xmath5 , and two charged ones @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the top quark has two supersymmetric partners , the lighter stop @xmath7 and the heavier stop @xmath8 .",
    "the top quark and the stops give important contributions to higgs masses due to radiative corrections ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , their contributions to the renormalization group equations can lead to electroweak symmetry breaking when the higgs parameters evolve from the gut scale to the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "therefore , the couplings of the stops to the neutral higgs bosons are of special interest . in this contribution",
    "we study stop production in @xmath0 collisions paying particular attention to the energy range near the higgs resonances .",
