    "dark matter ( dm ) is a ubiquitous component of the universe and dominates the mass density of virialized objects as galaxies and clusters of galaxies . the current scenario of galaxy evolution predicts that structures form bottom - up , i.e. the smallest haloes form first , and then , larger and more massive haloes are created from the merging of such smaller objects . within this scenario , numerical simulations of ( dm only ) structure formation within the standard @xmath5cdm framework have provided accurate predictions on the dm density distribution from dwarf to massive galaxies , up to bigger structures , such as clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , more realistic models have been produced to evaluate the effect of baryons on the dm distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "no model of galaxy formation can be complete without an understanding of how dwarf galaxies form , as these systems are the closest objects , in the nearby universe , to the building blocks of present , more massive , galaxies .",
    "their shallow potential wells make them susceptible to a large variety of processes , from supernova feedback , to externally induced effects , such as photoionization and heating from cosmic uv background , as well as environmental processes , such as tidal interactions and ram - pressure stripping ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this makes dwarf galaxies challenging to model , but at the same time , excellent laboratories to test important ingredients of astrophysics .",
    "providing a picture of the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies implies to understand the origin of their luminous and dark mass components . in this regard , together with age and metallicity , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a key stellar ingredient , as varying the imf can lead to variations of a factor of @xmath3 into the mass scale of galaxies .",
    "direct counts in the milky way ( mw ) have originally characterized the imf as a power - law mass - distribution , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 @xcite , and subsequently refined it to flatten at lower masses ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the imf has been initially considered as universal across galaxy types and cosmic time , mostly because of a lack of evidence of imf variations among stellar clusters and ob associations in our galaxy .",
    "this assumption has been recently questioned by a loud chorus of dynamical , lensing , and stellar population studies , finding evidence for systematic imf variations in massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these independent lines of evidence are interpreted with an excess of low - mass stars in high- ( relative to low-)mass etgs , implying lower dm fractions in these systems than found under the assumption of a universal , mw - like , distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , evidence for a heavier imf normalization , than the mw - like one , has been recently questioned for three nearby massive galaxies by @xcite and @xcite , based on a lensing analysis of low - redshift etgs .",
    "previous works of the dm and stellar mass distribution in galaxies have focused on the study of intermediate - luminosity and bright etgs , with stellar masses @xmath9 . at lower mass scales ,",
    "most of the analysis have assumed universal imf : e.g. @xcite , who have fitted long - slit spectroscopy for six dwarf ellipticals ( de ) , @xcite , who have performed the full dynamical modelling of 2d kinematic data of 12 des , @xcite , who use virial theorem to model effective velocity dispersion for a sample of 39 des .",
    "in contrast , there are very few analysis of the imf , see , e.g. , the direct constraints in ultra - faint dwarf galaxies around the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , to date , no detailed dynamical analysis has been performed to characterize both the dm content and imf normalization ( i.e. the stellar mass - to - light ratio normalized to that expected for a mw - like distribution ) at these low masses , e.g. in des . as more massive etgs",
    ", des are an ideal target for this kind of study , as they are dominated by old halo stars , have negligible star formation rate at present , and little dust content ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , making the computation of mass - to - light ratios less affected by systematics .    in this paper",
    ", we fill the above - mentioned gap , studying the central mass distribution of 39 virgo des , drawn from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t+14 ) , in the stellar mass range @xmath10 .",
    "we fit the central dynamics using various ( stellar and dm ) mass distribution profiles , comparing our findings with results for massive systems .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe the datasample and our dynamical method . in [ sec : results ] we discuss the results of the paper .",
    "conclusions are drawn in [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we analyze a sample of 39 des in the magnitude range @xmath11 , selected from the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc , @xcite ) to have high surface brightness with respect to the dwarf galaxy population ( @xcite ) .",
    "albeit incomplete in luminosity , this sample is representative of the early - type population in this magnitude range ( t+14 ) .",
    "the analysis relies on the following data :    * the h - band structural parameters ( the major - axis effective radius , , srsic index , n , and axis ratio , q ) are taken from t+14 and @xcite .",
    "the nucleus , if present , is excluded from the fit . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "while the global profiles of most galaxies are well approximated by a single srsic profile , a more detailed inspection reveals some significant deviations from a single component .",
    "for this reason , to analyze systematics in the modeling of the light profile , we have also investigated the impact of both single- and double - srsic fits on our results ( see [ sec : results ] ) . * * _ single srsic fit . _",
    "the structural parameters are taken from table  4 of t+14 , where the  from the growth curve fit and the srsic index from the single srsic fit are from @xcite .",
    "the s of the growth curve fits match reasonably well those from direct single - srsic fits . for 9 systems without a measured value of @xmath12 ( as they had no fit with a single srsic component or are not present in @xcite ) , we have adopted @xmath13 , testing the impact for different choices of this parameter ( see [ sec : results ] ) . although only 8 out of the 39 smakced des are best fitted with a single ( relative to a double ) srsic profile ( see below ) , to allow a more homogeneous comparison with massive etgs from the spider sample ( @xcite ) , we adopt single - component parameters as our reference case throughout the present work . * * _ double srsic fit . _",
    "data for the inner and outer srsic components are taken from table 5 in @xcite , for the 33 ( out of smakced sample of 39 ) des analyzed in that work . out of these 33 des ,",
    "25 objects are better described by multiple components , with 19 galaxies being described by a double srsic fit and 6 by a single srsic profile plus a lens . *",
    "effective velocity dispersions , , computed within an ellipse of semi - major axis length of one  ( t+14 ) .",
    "the s have been computed by  t+14 by flux - averaging both rotation velocity and velocity dispersion within each galaxy isophote , hence accounting for both ordered and random motions in each system . *",
    "age and metallicity estimates are taken from table  5 of t+14 , which have fitted relevant lick spectral indices  measured within the  ellipse  with @xcite simple stellar population ( ssp ) models . using exponentially declining star formation histories ,",
    "t+14 have demonstrated that the stellar masses are , on average , fairly consistent with the ssp estimates , but the scatter is larger . for four galaxies ( vcc 0170 , vcc 0781 , vcc 1304 and vcc 1684 ) @xmath14 and/or @xmath15",
    "are found in emission .",
    "the emission lines are narrower than absorption lines , thus the two components can be decoupled ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "although they do not find any significant emission in any of the other galaxies , they can not rule out the possibility of them having some emission .",
    "thus , for galaxies with undetected emission features the estimated ages ( and stellar masses ) would be taken as upper limits .",
    "see [ subsec : imf_dm ] for further details .      for each galaxy , we obtain the stellar h - band mass - to - light ( ) ratio , , using the best fitted age and metallicity from t+14 , and the simple stellar population ( ssp ) models of  @xcite , for a kroupa imf .",
    "these  are converted to those for a chabrier imf , by subtracting @xmath16 dex ( i.e. the difference in normalization between the kroupa and chabrier imfs ; @xcite ) . under the assumption of a radially constant ,",
    "the deprojected mass profile of the stellar component is written as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 . to derive the light profile @xmath19",
    ", we perform a deprojection , under the assumption of spherical symmetry , of the h - band srsic profiles ( from the galaxy structural parameters , see above ) .",
    "dynamical ( dm + light ) mass estimates are obtained by fitting the observed  with spherical , isotropic , jeans equations ( @xcite ) . to account for the fact that  is averaged within an elliptic aperture ,",
    "while we rely on spherical models , we calculate the 3d velocity dispersion from the radial jeans equation at the circularized ( geometric ) effective radius @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamical ( i.e. total ) mass distribution of galaxies is computed by adopting either single - component ( i.e. a radially constant dynamical ) or two - component profiles ( i.e. stellar component plus dm halo ) with the stellar  being a free fitting parameter , or fixed to  ( in case some other quantity , e.g. concentration , is let free to vary , see the different cases described below ) .    thus , after the mass model is chosen and the predicted velocity dispersion , @xmath21 , from the jeans equation , is derived , the equation @xmath22 is solved with respect to the free parameter p .. ] the uncertainties on the best - fitting parameter p and derived quantities are obtained by shifting the input parameters ( i.e. , , n , ) according to their errors a number of times and considering the distributions of corresponding best - fitting solutions .",
    "we rely only on velocity dispersions measured within a single aperture , which does not allow us to constrain the shape of the dm profile in detail . to this effect ,",
    "we explore a variety of models , analyzing several plausible assumptions .",
    "the range of models considered in this study are summarized in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "numerical collisionless n - body simulations have provided clues on the formation and the evolution of dm haloes , finding that the dm density of the haloes ( from dwarf galaxies to clusters ) is independent of halo mass and well described by a double power - law relation with a cusp at the center ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is a natural choice to start from this theoretical motivated class of dm profiles .    as reference case , we adopt the two - component mass profile ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , given by a srsic - based stellar mass distribution ( with @xmath23 as a free parameter ) and a standard dm halo with a (",
    "* nfw , hereafter ) density profile .",
    "we relate virial mass , @xmath24 , to concentration , @xmath25 , with the mean trend for a wmap5 cosmology ( for relaxed halos in @xcite ) , while the   relation is assumed from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m+10 hereafter ) , which extends down to stellar masses of @xmath26 .",
    "the model  is used to study the impact of varying the parametrization of the galaxy light distribution .",
    "for galaxies whose light distribution is better fitted by a multiple , rather than a single , component according to @xcite , we describe the stellar component with double - srsic fit parameters .",
    "following @xcite , we also explore how our results depend on the assumed   relation .",
    "in particular , since for higher mass galaxies ( than those analyzed in the present work ) , some studies suggest higher concentrations than those from simulations  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lfs12 ) , we also consider `` high - concentration '' models ( ) , with @xmath27 , in contrast to the typical value of @xmath28 predicted for our des from the @xcite relation ( for @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) . we refer to these models as `` high - concentration '' nfw models ,",
    "moreover , the impact of cosmological framework on the theoretical  relation is analyzed with models  and , which use wmap1 and wmap3 results from n - body simulations in @xcite .",
    "notice that wmap1 predictions are very similar to the  based on the first release of planck cosmological parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possible source of systematics is the hypothesis of isotropic stellar orbits , as spatially resolved stellar kinematics for a handful of des has been found to be better modelled with tangential anisotropies , rather than isotropy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although a detailed analysis of galaxy anisotropies is far from being trivial , and is certainly beyond the scope of the present work , we have estimated the impact of anisotropy on our inferences . to this effect , in our list of models ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , we have also included three cases corresponding to radially constant anisotropy @xmath31 in the jeans equations ( see also @xcite ) : a `` mild '' tangential anisotropy , @xmath32 , ( ) , a `` strong '' tangential anisotropy , @xmath33 , ( ) and a `` mild '' radial anisotropy , @xmath34 ( ) .    to further explore the effect of mass modelling , as well as the impact of adopting alternative theories of gravity on our results",
    ", we also consider the following models .",
    "in contrast to the dm haloes predicted by n - body simulations , a different class of models relies on the assumption that total mass follows the light distribution , i.e. constant  models with @xmath35 .",
    "thus , we adopt a no - dm model with constant profile , defined to have a total mass distribution @xmath36 , with  as the only free fitting parameter . * .",
    "a modified newtonian gravitational acceleration model , in the regime of low acceleration , according to the mond theory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , has become an alternative theory to reproduce galactic dynamics without dm .",
    "the acceleration as a function of the radius @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , 0 is the mond acceleration constant ( which sets the transition from the newtonian to the low acceleration regime ) ,  is the newtonian acceleration , and @xmath41 is an empirical function interpolating between the two regimes .",
    "we adopt the following expressions : a ) @xmath42 ( , @xcite ; @xcite ) and b ) @xmath43 , which has been the first one successfully tested with observations ( , @xcite ) .",
    "a constant  profile with a free  is adopted for the total mass distribution ( see @xcite for further details ) .    to complete our large model portfolio ,",
    "we also adopt two models with @xmath18 , with a fixed chabrier imf normalization :    * . a nfw model , adopting the same   relation used for , but dismissing the @xmath44 relation , and leaving  as a free parameter . * . a total mass distribution with radially constant , but setting @xmath18 .",
    "the total  is left free to vary .",
    "this model is characterized by a radially constant dm fraction .",
    "the final products of our analysis are the ssp , , the dynamically - determined stellar and total s ,  and , the inferred mismatch parameter  ( for models with free imf normalization ) , defined as @xmath45 , and effective dm fraction , @xmath46 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : fdm_vs_dimf ] we plot the results of our analysis . in the left panel , we plot  vs.  for our reference  model ( cyan symbols ) , while the median , computed for the whole sample of des , versus the median , are shown in the right panel , for all models listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ( error bars show the 16 - 84th percentile scatter in the data ) . for the `` standard '' , in two cases ( i.e. vcc 0009 and vcc 1355 ) the model fails to fit the data .",
    "only 50% of the sample is fitted by the `` high - concentration '' model , . for",

    "allow all galaxies to be fitted .",
    "the two - component ( or chabrier imf - fixed ) models fail to reproduce the data as the mass from the assumed dm model ( or from the chabrier imf - based model ) is larger than the total mass allowed by the observed .",
    "this is not contemplated in the  and mondian models , for which it is always possible to find a reproducing the data .    in the next sections we will discuss the  and estimates for each galaxy in the sample and then we will study the impact of mass model comparing the median and the standard error of the median calculated over the sample distribution of the models in [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "we also determine the 16 - 84th percentiles of the distributions .",
    "our reference  model produces , on average , @xmath47 ( @xmath48  @xmath49 dex ) and @xmath1 . the large scatter in",
    "( see points in the left panel and gray scatter bar in the right panel of figure  [ fig : fdm_vs_dimf ] ) is due to the fact that while most galaxies turn out to have an imf normalization consistent with a mw - like distribution ( @xmath48  @xmath50 ) , a significant fraction of them ( @xmath51 ) have a super - salpeter imf normalization ( i.e. @xmath52 ) .",
    "dm fractions are , on average , in the range @xmath53 to @xmath54 , consistent with independent estimates for `` normal '' ( as opposite to dwarf ) etgs ( see below ) .",

    "adopting @xmath57 uncertainties on  and n , and propagating the uncertainties on age and metallicity from table  5 in t+14 , we find @xmath58 average errors on  and  of @xmath59 dex and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "taking the uncertainties into account , we find that some des have  inconsistent ( heavier than ) a chabrier imf normalization .",
    "in particular , at the @xmath60 level , the galaxies vcc0397 , vcc0750 and vcc1684 have @xmath61 , while vcc0523 , vcc0781 , vcc1122 and vcc1528 have @xmath62 ( but @xmath63 ) . assuming @xmath64 ( rather than @xmath57 ) uncertainties on both  and n",

    "note that to these larger  correspond smaller dm fractions , with @xmath67@xmath68 .",
    "thus , while for most galaxies our results are consistent with a mw - like normalization , our analysis suggests that for at least a few des , the  detected from previous studies ( e.g. t+14 ) might be partly accounted for by heavier imf normalization , rather than large dm fractions in the galaxy central regions .",
    "note that a  larger than one can be due to either a bottom - heavy ( due to a larger fraction of dwarf relative to giant stars ) or a top - heavy imf ( because of the large fraction of stellar remnants from evolved massive stars ) .",
    "this degeneracy has been broken in etgs , by studying gravity - sensitive features in the integrated light of galaxies .",
    "such spectroscopic approach allows one to constrain the mass fraction of dwarf - to - giant stars in the imf , rather than its overall normalization , in contrast to dynamical and lensing methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indications of top - heavy imfs are found from a ) galaxy number counts ( @xcite ) , b ) in ultra compact dwarfs , based on the large fraction of low - mass x - ray binaries found ( @xcite ) , c ) in the mw center ( e.g. , @xcite ) or d ) in galactic globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , galaxy formation models reproduce the observed intra - cluster medium if a top - heavy imf is adopted ( @xcite ) . studies of gravity - sensitive features in des are still missing , thus , we can not exclude a top - heavy imf in these systems .    as mentioned in [ sec : data ] , srsic indices are measured only for 30 , out of 39 , des analyzed in this work . for systems with no available",
    "n , we have adopted @xmath13 . to test the effect of this assumption , we have varied the srsic @xmath12 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , which is a `` conservative '' range , encompassing the observed values , for the smakced sample of des . for the 7 ( out of 9 ) systems where the  fits do not fail , the impact of changing the @xmath12 is shown in the left panel of [ fig : fdm_vs_dimf ] ( see dark  green lines ) , which show how the  and values change when the @xmath12 is varied .",
    "larger srsic indices correspond to smaller  and larger .",
    "we find , on average , a mild variation of @xmath71  dex on both  and , with negligible impact on median values for the whole sample .",
    "we have further tested the effect of the @xmath13 assumption on the galaxies with a measured srsic index , by varying it to @xmath13 . on average ,",
    "the variation is @xmath72 for  and @xmath73 dex for .",
    "we have also tested the impact of different parametrization of the light on our dynamical estimates .",
    "the model  replaces the single srsic profile with the double srsic parametrization for those systems which are better fitted by the latter model .",
    "the results over the whole sample for both and  models are plotted in the left panel of [ fig : fdm_vs_dimf ] , to highlight the effect of a refined description of the light distribution in our dynamical analysis .",
    "the galaxies with the largest  are the most affected .",
    "however , the medians computed over the whole sample are almost unchanged with respect to the reference  ( see right panel of [ fig : fdm_vs_dimf ] ) .    as we have mentioned in [ subsec :",
    "data ] , galactic nuclei , if present , are excluded in the fit of the light distribution of the smacked des .",
    "it is important to quantify the impact on our results if these nuclei are included in the analysis . because it is not trivial to extract the amount of light due to the nuclei from t+14 , we rely on estimates from independent literature .",
    "9 out of the 39 galaxies are shared with @xcite , who has provided estimates of nuclear fluxes , @xmath74 , at @xmath75 and total ones , @xmath76 ( their table 1 ) , finding that the nuclei account for @xmath77 of the total flux .",
    "assuming that this limit can be extended to the whole smakced sample , we have included in our modelling procedure a constant mass distribution with flux @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",

    "the  would get smaller by more than @xmath79 dex for nuclei which account for more than @xmath57 of the total flux . however , such prominent nuclei are not observed .    finally , correcting for not detected emission lines would make the ages and stellar masses smaller , getting  and  larger . to provide a quantification of this effect",
    "we have augmented the measured @xmath80 index by its error ( which we use to estimate the impact of emission ) , and matched it with @xcite model predictions , deriving younger stellar populations .",

    "as already discussed , a value as high as @xmath27 is able to describe only @xmath84 of the smakced des .",
    "these models predict too much mass in the center than what is allowed by the measured .",
    "together with the fact that the chabrier imf gives the minimum normalization with respect to either top- or bottom - heavier distributions ( when other relevant stellar population parameters , such as age and metallicity , are fixed ) , this result suggests that high concentration models are generally disfavoured for smakced des . since only 50% of the sample",
    "is fitted , the standard errors of the median get higher , i.e. @xmath56 for  and @xmath85 dex for . for what concerns different theoretical predictions for the  correlation",

    "the highest  are obtained , as expected , by the model with no dm , i.e.  ( filled blue square and error bar in figure  [ fig : fdm_vs_dimf ] ) , where  is significantly larger than the  case ( @xmath91 ) , with @xmath92 of galaxies nominally consistent with a super - salpeter imf normalization .",
    "when assuming tangential anisotropy , all galaxies in this model would turn out to have super - salpeter normalization .    for what concerns models with modified gravity ,",

    "looking at their face values , @xcite  are , on average , larger by @xmath49 .",
    "these jam values look quite similar to the virial predictions , which assume the same k - value of massive etgs in @xcite .",
    "if we normalize these mass definitions to our  model , the discrepancy is even larger ( by @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , we find that this discrepancy is possibly related to inhomogeneity between the smakced and @xcite data sets as differences in a ) wavebands used to calculate structural parameters and  ( h - band in smakced vs. r - band in @xcite ) , b ) stellar mass determinations , since absorption lines are fitted with @xcite models in smakced survey and color - to - formula from @xcite is used in @xcite , and c ) estimated velocity dispersions .",

    "we discuss our results for des into the broader framework of the continuity of intrinsic properties of spheroidal systems , comparing the finding for des with those for a local ( @xmath103 ) , complete , sample of @xmath104 giant etgs drawn from the spider survey ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details about sample selection ) .",
    "the spider dataset includes stellar masses derived from the fit of stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models to optical@xmath105near - infrared photometry ( @xcite ) , galaxy structural parameters ( effective radius  and srsic index @xmath12 ; using 2dphot , @xcite ) , homogeneously derived from @xmath106 through @xmath107 wavebands , and sdss central - aperture velocity dispersions , @xmath108 .",
    "spider etgs are defined as luminous bulge dominated systems , featuring passive spectra in the central sdss fiber aperture ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical analysis , presented in our previous papers for spider etgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , is similar to that carried out for des in the present work .",
    "in particular , we have derived dm content and imf normalization for spider etgs using the  profile , i.e. assuming the nfw+srsic profile , with the same   and   relations as for des .",
    "the results for de and luminous etgs are compared in figure  [ fig : size_sigma_mstar ] , where  and  are plotted as a function of  ( see also t+14 ) , and colour - coded in terms of  and  ( left- and right - panels ) , respectively .",
    "the figure shows the well - known shallower and   relations for des , with respect to the relations for luminous etgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . note that des have an almost constant  with respect to , with no dependence of  on  at fixed stellar mass ( see big dots with different colors in the top  left panel of figure  [ fig : size_sigma_mstar ] ) . on the contrary , in the ",
    "plot ( bottom  left panel ) , larger  correspond to larger .",
    "notice that this is expected in our one - parameter  models , as des have almost constant , and at fixed  the only way to match a higher  is thus to have a larger ( smaller )  ( , see bottom ",
    "right panel ) . for what concerns",
    "the behaviour with  ( right panels of the figure ) , we also notice that both des and luminous etgs have effective dm fractions driven by , since bigger galaxies have larger   ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the trends of  and  with  and  are plotted more explicitly for des and luminous etgs , in [ fig : dimf_fdm_mstar ] ( red and black symbols , respectively ) .",
    "the  ( ) appears to increase ( decrease ) with  ( panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) consistent with what seen in [ fig : size_sigma_mstar ] , while no significant correlation of both  and  is seen with @xmath109 ( panels ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "however , we remind the reader that although representative of the population of des , smakced sample is certainly incomplete with respect to  and .",
    "further analysis , based on spatially extended kinematical data ( i.e. 2d spectroscopy ) and complete galaxy samples , are required to pinpoint the intrinsic correlations of dm and imf normalization with galaxy parameters in des .    for what concerns",
    "median values of  and  ( red dots and errorbars in [ fig : dimf_fdm_mstar ] ) , we see that in the   diagram ( panel ( b ) ) , the median  for des is consistent , overall , with that for etgs .",
    "this is due to the fact that while most des have  consistent with a mw - like normalization , a significant fraction of them exhibit a salpeter or super - salpeter normalization ( [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "in fact , when looking at the",
    "  plot ( panel ( a ) ) , we see that des tend to have , on average , slightly higher imf normalization than the lowest  etgs ( whose normalization is fully consistent with the mw - like distribution ) .",
    "interestingly , the trend of  with  ( panel ( d ) ) points to a double - value behaviour of dm content with stellar mass in etgs , with larger  in most massive etgs ( @xmath110 ) and des ( @xmath111 ) , and a minimum at @xmath112 .    to have some further hints of the  trends , we have constructed toy mass models , based on our reference  model by computing stellar mass profiles according to either a chabrier or a salpeter imf , and adopting the mean size- and @xmath12-mass relations of des and massive etgs , respectively .",
    "results for the  trends are shown in the bottom panels of [ fig : dimf_fdm_mstar ] . at fixed imf , such toy - models predict a double - value trend for the  as a function of both  and @xmath113 ( panel c and d ) . in the @xmath114 diagram ( panel d ) , this trend matches quite well the observations for both des and etgs .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath115 diagram , the toy - models give a good match to des ( although some overall variation of  is required to exactly match the trend , as also seen in panel a ) , while there is a clear mismatch in the case of massive etgs , where toy models predict an increasing trend of while the inferred  tends to midly decrease with .",
    "as seen in panel a , this disagreement is due to the fact that toy models assume a constant imf normalization , while data imply a strong trend of  with . in summary",
    ", our toy - models also support a double - value behaviour in the correlation .",
    "we have also verified that the double - value trend of  does not depend critically on our assumptions of a given relation .",
    "in fact , a similar result is found when considering the  model .",
    "the u - shape behaviour of  with  in early - type systems can be understood as a result of different feedback mechanisms in these systems at different mass scales . in lowest mass galaxies ( des ) ,",
    "star - formation is likely inhibited by ( e.g. ) supernovae feedback .",
    "this becomes less important at increasing galaxy mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , at the highest , additional processes , such as dry merging , agn feedback or halo - mass quenching further inhibit gas cooling , and decrease star - formation efficiency again ( @xcite ) . hence , the lowest- and highest - mass galaxies are expected to have the lowest star - formation efficiency , and thus , under the assumption of a universal dm distribution , the highest dm content .",
    "the  trend in des and luminous etgs adds up to other well known correlations in etgs , such as the trends of total  and star formation efficiency ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; m+10 ) , the u - shape of half - light dynamical  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xmath116 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and size - mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) relations , the trends of optical colour and metallicity gradients ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as dm gradients ( @xcite ) with galaxy mass .",
    "in this work , we have performed an isotropic jeans dynamical analysis for 39 dwarf ellipticals in the virgo cluster , from t+14 . for the first time",
    ", we have studied the imf normalization and the effective dm content using a suite of fixed dm profiles and the stellar  as a free - fitting parameter .",
    "we have also performed the analysis with mond , modified - gravity , models .",
    "the main results are shown in figure  [ fig : fdm_vs_dimf ] where we find that , on average , using a nfw profile and standard -  relation from n - body simulations (  model in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , des have @xmath117 with error @xmath56 dex ( i.e. consistent with a chabrier - like imf normalization ) and @xmath118 with error @xmath119 . a constant - model , with no  dm content ( the  model ) , maximizes the stellar mass content ( i.e. the ) , pointing to super - salpeter imf normalizations .",
    "in the mond scenario , using two standard interpolating functions ( , @xcite ; , @xcite ) we find results which encompass the nfw predictions , in agreement with results for massive etgs ( @xcite ) . for completeness , we have also analyzed the cases of a universal chabrier imf ( and ) , which provide larger effective dm fractions when compared to our reference model with free imf normalization , .",
    "the derived dm fractions for the  model are fully consistent with the estimates in @xcite , if stellar and dynamical masses are homogeneously defined .",
    "we have also analyzed the impact of several further assumption , such as light - profile parametrization , velocity dispersion anisotropy , and assumptions on the  relation .",
    "in particular , at the mass scale of des , our data seem to disfavour a ",
    "relation steeper than that from simulations , as it might be the case for more massive halos ( see  @xcite ) , while if tangential anisotropy is assumed ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we obtain larger  and smaller  with respect to the reference isotropic case ( on the contrary , radial anisotropy produces larger  and smaller ) . although most of des have consistent with a mw - like normalization , for the reference model , we also find evidence that some des might have @xmath120 or @xmath121 at high statistical significance , i.e. an imf which is heavier that a chabrier- or salpeter - like distribution .",
    "in figures [ fig : size_sigma_mstar ] and [ fig : dimf_fdm_mstar ] , we have compared results for des with those for massive etgs from the spider sample ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find some hints that  might increase with , as in more massive etgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , spatially extended kinematical data ( i.e. 2d spectroscopy ) and complete galaxy samples are required to confirm if this trend is real , rather than due to sample incompleteness .",
    "moreover , we find that , on average , des tend to have slightly higher imf normalization than etgs at lowest  ( @xmath122  @xmath123 , whose imf normalization is fully consistent with a mw - like distribution ) .",
    "the trend of  with  suggests a double - value behaviour , with largest  in most massive etgs ( @xmath124 ) and de s ( @xmath111 ) , and a minimum at @xmath125 .",
    "these trends mirror those of the dynamical  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and of total star formation efficiency with respect to mass ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; m+10 ) , which are the result of the interplay among different physical processes , such as sn feedback at lowest galaxy masses , and agn feedback , galaxy merging and halo mass heating in the most massive etgs ( @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we have performed a first attempt to constrain , simultaneously , the imf normalization and dark matter content of low - mass ( dwarf ) early - type galaxies , finding for at least a few systems that the  is heavier than the mw - like value .",
    "since such a `` heavy ''  could be due to either a bottom- or a top- heavy distribution , a natural follow - up of the present work would be to study gravity - sensitive features in the integrated light of galaxies , which have provided , so far , important constraints to the imf slope of massive etgs ( @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , a similar analysis is currently lacking for de s . in the future",
    ", it will be also necessary to apply the present analysis to large and complete samples including a variety of stellar systems , such as dwarf ellipticals , dwarf spheroidals , ultra - compact dwarfs , and late - type galaxies , to achieve a complete picture of how the dark matter and stellar components have been assembled along the whole galaxy mass sequence .",
