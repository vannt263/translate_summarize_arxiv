    "weakly interacting dark matter ( dm ) particles are actively being searched for through a variety of methods .",
    "strong bounds on their parameter space have been established by direct detection @xcite , indirect detection @xcite and collider @xcite experiments .",
    "however , these limits are weakened substantially in leptophilic dm models , see for example refs .",
    "such models feature weak - strength interactions between the dm particle , @xmath2 , and standard model ( sm ) leptons at the tree level , but dm  quark couplings are induced only at the loop level @xcite .",
    "some of the strongest collider bounds on leptophilic models thus stem from searches for mono - photon events at @xmath0 machines .",
    "this signature is characteristic for the process @xmath3 , where an initial - state photon recoils against the dm particle pair , which is not observed in the detector .",
    "constraints on leptophilic dm from mono - photon searches at lep have been analyzed in ref .",
    "these limits may be greatly improved by a future international linear collider ( ilc ) with a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the precise bounds depend on the mass , spin and couplings of the dm particle and the mediator that communicates the interaction between dm and sm particles . in this work , however , it is shown that comparable or even stronger bounds can be obtained from the analysis of four - lepton contact interactions contributing to the process @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "lep has put tight constraints on any new - physics contributions to these four - lepton processes @xcite , and these limits are expected to be substantially strengthened at the ilc .",
    "we here demonstrate that in leptophilic dm scenarios , such four - lepton contact interactions are necessarily generated either through tree - level exchange of the mediator or through loop contributions involving the dm and mediator particles .",
    "we use a model - independent framework where the sm is extended by a single dm field and a single mediator field , with arbitrary renormalizable couplings and arbitrary spin ( up to spin 1 ) of the new particles @xcite .",
    "this framework will be introduced in section  [ models ] .",
    "the four - fermion bounds are derived in an effective field theory ( eft ) framework , where it is assumed that the mediator particle is heavy compared to the @xmath0 cm energy .",
    "limits derived from lep data will be presented in section  [ tree ] and section  [ loop ] for scenarios where the four - lepton interaction is generated at tree - level or loop - level , respectively . in section  [ ilc ]",
    ", we use these results to estimate the projected reach of the ilc for leptophilic dm through contact interactions .",
    "finally , comparisons with non - collider experiments and the applicability of the eft are discussed in section  [ disc ] , before concluding in section  [ concl ] .",
    "to define our framework of leptophilic dm models , we adopt the classification of simplified models from ref .",
    "only renormalizable models are considered , which implies that the interaction between the dm and sm leptons is facilitated by a ( heavy ) mediator particle .",
    "the models are characterized by the spins ( 0 , @xmath8 or 1 ) of the dm particle ( denoted @xmath2 ) and of the mediator particle ( denoted @xmath9 ) .",
    "the dark / hidden sector may contain additional heavy particles , but it is assumed that they are not relevant for the dm phenomenology . to ensure its stability ,",
    "@xmath2 is assigned to be odd under a @xmath10 symmetry , while @xmath9 is @xmath10-even or -odd depending on the form of the interaction .    in tab .",
    "[ tab : mod ] , the full list of models and the form of their interactions is given .",
    "here the spins of @xmath2 and @xmath9 are denoted by the letters `` s '' , `` f '' and `` v '' for scalar , fermion and vector , respectively . for a bosonic mediator @xmath9 , one can construct models where @xmath9 appears either in the @xmath11- or @xmath12-channel of the annihilation diagram @xmath13 . to distinguish these possibilities ,",
    "the @xmath12-channel mediation is denoted by `` ts '' or `` tv '' .",
    ".list of simplified models involving a dm field @xmath2 , mediator field @xmath9 and sm lepton field @xmath14 @xcite . here ``",
    "s '' , `` f '' and `` v '' denote fields of spin 0 , @xmath8 and 1 , respectively , while `` ts '' and `` tv '' indicate that the mediator is exchanged in the @xmath12-channel of the dm annihilation process .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 project onto chiral fermion states . [ cols=\"^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in ref .  @xcite the expected reach from mono - photon searches at ilc",
    "was compared to limits from direct and indirect detection . for models where",
    "the dark sector couples flavor - universally to leptons , but not to quarks , the constraints from direct detection are loop - suppressed . as a result ,",
    "the projected mono - photon bounds are stronger than the present - day direct detection limits for kinematically accessible dm masses at the ilc ( @xmath16 ) . for the same mass range , they are also stronger than indirect detection constraints from the pamela and ams-02 experiments .    as shown in the previous section , for @xmath11-channel mediated models the projected bounds from four - lepton contact interactions significantly exceed the reach of mono - photon searches at ilc",
    ". therefore they will be the strongest constraints on this class of models .",
    "moreover , they are independent of @xmath17 and thus can cover the entire parameter space that is probed by direct detection experiments .    for @xmath12-channel mediated models , the four - lepton bounds are comparable to mono - photon bounds for @xmath16 and couplings @xmath18 . however , the four - lepton limits extend also to larger dm masses , where they will be competitive with current and future direct detection limits",
    ".    if the dm and mediator fields are part of large electroweak su(2 ) gauge multiplets , the additional states in these multiplets will also contribute to the four - lepton contact interactions .",
    "for small su(2 ) representations , such as doublets or triplets , the sum of extra diagrams enhances the expected new - physics signal with respect to the minimal contributions studied in this work .",
    "therefore , our results can still be used as conservative bounds for simple non - minimal dark sectors . however , more complex dark sectors , for example involving new types of interactions , may lead to destructive interference in the @xmath19 operators , so that our results are not directly applicable to these cases .",
    "leptophilic dm models are additionally motivated by their ability to explain the observed discrepancy @xmath20 between the measured value and the sm prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite . for models with @xmath12-channel mediators ,",
    "the correct value for @xmath20 can be obtained for dark - sector masses @xmath21 of a few hundred gev .",
    "this parameter region is also probed by four - fermion contact interactions .",
    "in fact , the lep limits already exclude the majority of the preferred parameter space for @xmath20 , except for self - conjugate scalar dm , where the four - lepton contributions vanish @xcite .",
    "the results in this paper have been obtained by adopting the eft framework used by the lep collaborations .",
    "the eft is formally only valid for @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath23 additional operators may need to be included for a fully consistent description , although their numerical impact is expected to be subdominant , as discussed in section  [ loop ] . as evident from figs .",
    "[ fig : fs ] , [ fig : fv ] , [ fig : t - scalar - ilc ] and [ fig : t - vector - ilc ] , these conditions are only fulfilled for models with @xmath12-channel mediator if the @xmath24-@xmath2-@xmath9 coupling is larger than about one . for smaller couplings ,",
    "the eft treatment breaks down .",
    "instead one would need to compare exact results for the relevant box diagrams with the experimental data for the process @xmath25 .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "but our results provide an approximate indication of the achievable limits in these weak - coupling scenarios .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the sensitivity of @xmath26 interactions to minimal models of leptophilic dm .",
    "we have considered scenarios with @xmath11- and @xmath12-channel mediation in an eft , where the mediator and dm fields do not appear as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the low - energy imprints of the dark sector are encoded in effective four - lepton interactions , which have been strongly constrained by lep and can be tested at a future @xmath27 collider .    in models with @xmath11-channel mediation ,",
    "four - lepton interactions are sensitive to the mediator field and its coupling to sm leptons only .",
    "lep bounds on these interactions limit the coupling - to - mass ratio to @xmath28 at the @xmath29 c.l . @xmath30-channel",
    "mediators with masses below the terascale are thus excluded by lep , if their coupling to leptons is of @xmath31 .",
    "scenarios with @xmath12-channel mediation induce four - lepton interactions at the one - loop level , involving both the mediator and the dm fields .",
    "we have focused on chiral interactions with leptons , where effects on four - lepton interactions can be expressed by one single chiral vector - current operator @xmath32 or @xmath33 . due to the loop suppression ,",
    "lep bounds on @xmath12-channel mediated scenarios are rather weak for couplings @xmath34 . for larger couplings , thanks to the @xmath35 scaling of the effective four - lepton interaction , lep bounds for scenarios with scalars extend to masses of a few hundred gev . in scenarios with complex vector bosons ,",
    "the loop - induced four - lepton interactions are gauge - dependent and thus require an embedding into a complete theory at high energies .",
    "we have considered a framework with composite vector bosons and implemented an energy cutoff by introducing a simple form factor .",
    "the resulting bounds depend strongly on the compositeness scale @xmath36 . with the conservative assumption that @xmath36 lies close above the vector - boson mass ,",
    "lep bounds on scenarios with composite vectors are slightly stronger than for scalars .    at a future ilc",
    ", the sensitivity to leptophilic dm can be significantly enhanced due to three main factors : a larger cm energy , higher luminosity and the possibility of polarized beams .",
    "we have estimated the reach of ilc by rescaling the lep bounds with respect to these three factors . as a result ,",
    "the ilc sensitivity to @xmath11-channel mediators increases by one order of magnitude with respect to lep , yielding @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , @xmath12-channel scenarios can be probed up to masses in the multi - tev range for @xmath38(12 ) couplings .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with mono - photon signals @xmath39 , hitherto considered one of the most efficient observables to constrain dm at colliders . in weak - coupling scenarios ,",
    "the sensitivity of four - lepton interactions is comparable to mono - photon signals at lep and ilc .",
    "however , for couplings of strength larger than one , four - lepton interactions cover a dm mass range way above the production limit in mono - photon searches , @xmath40 .    in the future ,",
    "precision measurements of the process @xmath26 will yield information on leptophilic dm models that goes beyond effective four - lepton interactions .",
    "differential distributions and polarization - dependent observables at the ilc can probe the structure of the dark sector in much more detail .",
    "virtual effects in lepton interactions are thus an interesting alternative and an important complement to mono - photon searches in exploring leptophilic dm at colliders .",
