    "@xcite it was shown that the classical piece of the leading form factors follows simply from the requirement that the long range component of the matrix element of the energy - momentum tensor agree with the well known form @xmath110 for the diagonal components of @xmath85 , this leads for a point charge @xmath34 to @xmath111 which can easily be shown to correspond to fourier transform of the leading diagonal classical loop corrections to the energy - momentum tensor , _",
    "i.e. , _ those terms of the loop calculation proportional to s @xmath112 where we have used the forms @xmath113 found above .",
    "however , when the charged particle carries spin , a magnetic field @xmath114 must also be included .",
    "this changes the diagonal pieces of the energy - momentum tensor by calculable higher order terms , which means that the _ leading _ diagonal pieces determined by the form factors @xmath115 should be unchanged and therefore independent of @xmath52 as found in eq .",

    "the presence of a magnetic field leads to a nonvanishing off - diagonal component @xmath116 which means that the classical component of our loop correction to the off - diagonal component of the energy momentum tensor must also have this form @xmath117 from eq .",
    "[ eq : gm ] we find @xmath118 whose fourier transform yields the expected form .",
    "thus the linear proportionality of the classical loop correction to @xmath119 to the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath52 is expected , and it is only if the value @xmath106 is employed that the kerr - newman metric is reproduced .",
    "nevertheless , we find that other consistent values to the metric tensor are reproduced if alternative values of the gyromagnetic ratio apply . in the case of the quantum component of the loop correction",
    "the ratio of the spin 1 and spin 1/2 terms is found to be @xmath120 so that again use of the value @xmath106 guarantees universality for both the classical and the quantum correction as well as brings these results into conformity with the kerr - newman form .",
    "this point deserves further study .",
    "above we have calculated the radiative corrections to the energy - momentum tensor of a spin 1 system .",
    "we have confirmed the universality which was speculated in our previous work in that we have confirmed that @xmath121 the universality in the case of the classical ( square root ) nonanalyticities is not surprising and in fact is _ required _ by the connection to the metric tensor and to the classical form of the energy - momentum tensor  eqn .",
    "[ eq : em ] . in the case of the quantum ( logarithmic )",
    "nonanalyticities , however , it is not clear why these terms must be universal .",
    "we also found additional higher order form factors for spin 1 , which also receive loop corrections .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that this radiative correction universality holds for arbitrary spin .",
    "however , it is probably not possible to show this by generalizing the calculations above . indeed",
    "the spin 1 result involves _ considerably _ more computation than does its spin 1/2 counterpart , which was already much more tedious than that for spin 0 .",
