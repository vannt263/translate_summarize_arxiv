    "it is safe to say that , at this point in time , we do not understand string ( or m ) theory as well as we would like .",
    "while we have understood and appreciated that there is a rich bounty of physical phenomena contained in the theory , this has mostly been uncovered in perturbation theory , occasionally sweetened by a glimpse into the non  perturbative realm afforded by special sectors of the theory such as soliton solutions ( including branes of various sorts ) or various topological reductions .",
    "the physics that we have so far learned from the theory has provided numerous promising and exciting phenomenological scenarios that form the basis for several research endeavours to understand and incorporate current experimental and observational data from nature , and furnish testable predictions about new physics .",
    "these endeavours are still embryonic , and can not fully mature without much more understanding of the underlying theory .    furthermore , much of what we have learned pertains to the critical string theories , a rich class for study of course , but after all of the non  perturbative lessons that we have learned in the last decade , the fact that as a field we mostly still linger in the critical domain should be regarded as nothing more than the force of habit ; so much historical baggage . having broken free of the shackles of perturbative thinking , there is no compelling physical reason to restrict attention to critical strings in a search for a description of nature .",
    "it is time to try to move on to other areas of the theory , where the tools and concepts we need to make contact with nature may well be waiting to be found .",
    "there has been some movement . due to progress in the understanding of open string sectors in liouville conformal field",
    "theory@xcite , and following on from the proposal in ref.@xcite , recent years have seen a growing realisation that the @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) non - critical string theories ( equivalently @xmath8 , so `` subcritical '' ) , despite being rather simple as compared to their higher dimensional cousins , contain several model examples of the non  perturbative phenomena that have so fascinated us from higher dimensional critical strings such as d ",
    "branes , holography , open  closed transitions , tachyon condensation , etc .",
    "in fact , this class of models first arrived at by double scaling certain matrix models@xcite contains the earliest examples of fully non ",
    "perturbative formulations of string theories , which remain the _ only _ formulations available where one can ask and answer ( appropriate ) questions arbitrarily far from perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , the fact that one can get different string theories by expanding the physics in different small parameters ( something we d like to better understand about m  theory and the critical string theories ) is manifest in these models .",
    "for example , in one class of models first found and studied extensively in refs.@xcite , identified as @xmath9 type 0a strings in refs.@xcite , and to be further discussed at length in this paper , the physics is contained rather succinctly in a non  linear differential equation , with no reference to strings and their world  sheets .",
    "it is only when a small dimensionless parameter is identified and the solution is expanded in terms of this parameter does the physics take on the interpretation of a string theory ( where the small parameter is the string coupling ) which can be open or closed depending upon which parameter is taken to be small strings in this class , there has even been a recent attempt to formulate a sort of m  theory specifically .",
    "see ref.@xcite . ] .",
    "the celebrated non  perturbative phenomena mentioned near the beginning of the previous paragraph are examples of exciting physics of which we would like even more examples , and of which we would like better understanding .",
    "the type of non  perturbative formulations under discussion furnish such examples and enhance our understanding somewhat by sharpening the terms in which the phenomena of interest are expressed and by confirming them as robust ( perhaps even generic ) non  perturbative features of the theory .",
    "double scaled matrix models ( and their accompanying physics ) were abandoned as non  perturb - ative approaches by the field only a few years after their first construction , the main reasons cited being non  perturbative ambiguities ( see e.g. , discussion and analysis in refs.@xcite ) and oversimplicity .",
    "this was despite clear demonstrations that there were fully consistent and unambiguous models@xcite available which avoided these objections , and non  perturbative maps between models with closed and open strings@xcite",
    ". we should be careful to not make the same mistake twice and again turn our attention away from these models prematurely .",
    "there is an important question to ask : now that we have recognised that these models describe so many of our favourite important non  perturbative phenomena , can we learn from them about new non  perturbative physics that has hitherto been overlooked ?    it is with this question in mind that we continue our investigations in this area . in this paper",
    "we explore further a number of the observations reported in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "we sharpen the observations and explicitly extend several features . a particular theme which has arisen , and that is quite striking in the results of this paper and",
    "the last is the fact that the underlying connections to structures from certain integrable systems seem to be becoming physically clearer and broader in scope .",
    "for example , while it has been known for some time@xcite that the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) hierarchy of flows organises the closed string operator content in these models , it was only recently realised ( in our previous paper@xcite ) that the well  known bcklund transformations that change the number of solitons in a solution of the kdv equation actually have meaning in this context : they change the number of background `` zz''@xcite d  branes in the model , in one regime , or the number of units of background r ",
    "r flux in another . that there is a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between d  branes ( usually thought of as solitons in a very different sense ) and solitons of kdv ( the prototype solitons ) is both ironic and interesting .",
    "we will explore this and the role of the bcklund transformation further in this paper .",
    "closely allied to the bcklund transformation is the miura map which connects solutions of the kdv hierarchy to that of another integrable hierarchy , the `` modified '' kdv ( mkdv ) system .",
    "it was noticed long ago in ref.@xcite that this map is invertible when applied to solutions of the string equations for ( what we now know is ) the type 0a system , and connects them to solutions of another set of equations , the painlev ii hierarchy .",
    "these equations were known ( from the work of periwal and shevitz@xcite ) to arise from double scaling unitary matrix models , but it was not understood exactly what was their string theory interpretation .",
    "the work of ref.@xcite therefore gave an interpretation , for the first time , for the double scaled unitary matrix models : they were really secretly systems of open and closed strings , just written in rather apparently strange variables defined by the miura map .",
    "now we know that there is more , and in this paper we make explicit the role of the unitary matrix models and their associated painlev ii string equations .",
    "the physics derived from those systems is simply that of a probe `` fzzt''@xcite d  brane when it has been stretched entirely in the liouville direction , terminating on a family of zz d  branes living at positive infinity .",
    "the worldsheet expansions obtained from the solution of the painlev ii equation give all of the open string worldsheets associated to this configuration .",
    "we show that the partition functions of this special probe configuration are actually a type of non ",
    "normalizable threshold bound state wavefunction of an associated supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( a system well  known to be associated to the kdv  mkdv hierarchies ) , and their non  normalizability serves to spontaneously break the supersymmetry .",
    "these particular wavefunctions are a special case of the baker ",
    "akheizer function of the integrable system , already identified@xcite as being the partition function of fzzt d ",
    "brane probes .",
    "this sharper understanding of the interconnected role of the kdv , mkdv , bcklund , miura , baker ",
    "akheizer structures in terms of familiar physical objects in open and closed string theory is rather pleasing , and highly suggestive .",
    "consider the following one  dimensional quantum mechanics problem : @xmath10 where the hamiltonian is : @xmath11 the potential @xmath12 satisfies the differential equation@xcite : @xmath13 and here @xmath14 .",
    "our physics will require that @xmath12 is a real function of the real variable  @xmath15 . a prime denotes @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants .",
    "the physics also imposes the following boundary conditions : @xmath19 evidently @xmath18 plays the role of @xmath20 in this system .",
    "the classical limit ( @xmath21 ) will be the classical limit of the underlying string theory , as we shall see : taking a few more terms in the expansion of @xmath12 , we have : @xmath22 the partition function @xmath23 of the string theory is obtained from @xmath12 using : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coefficient of the lowest dimension operator in the world  sheet theory .",
    "so integrating twice , we get an expansion : @xmath26 which is an asymptotic expansion in the dimensionless string coupling @xmath27 . in this expansion ,",
    "since the sphere term is non  universal and can be dropped ( since it contains no non  analytic behaviour in @xmath25 ) , the positive @xmath15 region is a purely open string expansion , and @xmath17 , which comes multiplying every worldsheet boundary , has the interpretation as counting the number of species of d  brane present@xcite .",
    "these are fully localized `` zz '' d  branes .",
    "see figure  [ fig : zzbranes ] .    ) given by perturbatively solving the string equation for large positive @xmath15 . ]",
    "the negative @xmath15 region is a purely closed string expansion , and @xmath28 accompanies a worldsheet insertion of a vertex operator in the presence of @xmath17 units of background r ",
    "see figure  [ fig : flux ] .",

    "each vertex operator insertion gives a factor @xmath29 .",
    "there must be an even number of insertions . ]",
    "let us look at the potential .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammaplots ] shows the typical features , discussed in detail in ref.@xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : gammaplots]_(a ) _ we show only the case of positive integer @xmath17 , while in figure  [ fig : gammaplots ] _ ( b ) _ we show the case of @xmath30 .",
    "note that it becomes progressively more difficult to solve for @xmath12 with the given boundary conditions as @xmath17 approaches minus one .",
    "however the bcklund transformation ( defined later in equation  ( [ eq : back - explicit - gam ] ) ) defined below allows us to overcome this difficulty , and the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : moregammaplots ] .    ) for @xmath12 : _ ( a ) _ cases of positive integer @xmath17 , and _ ( b ) _ some cases of @xmath30.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) for @xmath12 : _ ( a ) _ cases of positive integer @xmath17 , and _ ( b ) _ some cases of @xmath30.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in ref.@xcite we showed , using a combination of numerical and analytic studies , that the case of integer @xmath17 is rather distinct from that of non  integer @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , we showed there that once one restricts to the integers , the positive integers are selected by the system , since there is a non  perturbative transformation which relates @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( which was first deduced in ref.@xcite , and made explicit in ref.@xcite ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and starting with @xmath35 it is easy to see that @xmath36 , as is suggested@xcite in the numerical behaviour of the function for arbitrary @xmath17 studies ( see figure  [ fig : moregammaplots ] ) . by extension ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath37  .",
    "this is consistent with the theory being charge conjugation invariant .",
    "in fact , one can run the argument the other way around : starting with a requirement that the theory be charge conjugation invariant , the properties of the equations and their solutions that we uncovered are enough to prove that @xmath17 must be a positive integer .",
    "it was also noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the transformation above is in fact the celebrated bcklund transformation of the kdv system , specialized to our system of solutions .     of @xmath38 for @xmath39 small and positive , generated by using the bcklund transformations on @xmath40 curves .",
    "they increasingly approach the @xmath41 curve ( shown dotted at the top ) , in a manner which is consistent with a limit where the exact identity @xmath42 is satisfied ( see text ) . ]",
    "it was also realized in ref.@xcite that @xmath17 represents the formal soliton number of the solution given by @xmath12 , further reinforcing the idea that the positive integers are natural values for it to take .",
    "this is why the bcklund transformation naturally acts here .",
    "they are well  known to change by an integer the number of solitons in a kdv solution .",
    "we use the term `` formal '' above because @xmath12 does not have standard soliton boundary conditions ( it does not vanish in both asymptotic directions ) , and because the bound states to which the solitons correspond ( _ via _ inverse scattering theory ) are of zero energy ( @xmath43 in equation  ( [ eq : quantummechanics ] ) ) .",
    "let us now develop this much further . turning to study the properties of our wavefunctions of this system",
    ", we can make the following observations .",
    "the potential becomes linear in the large positive @xmath15 regime , @xmath44 , and so the wavefunction will behave like an airy function in this regime : @xmath45 meanwhile , in the large negative @xmath15 regime , the potential vanishes to leading order , and at next order is : @xmath46 so the schrdinger equation is : @xmath47 notice what happens when we change variables using @xmath48 , and define @xmath49 , we get the equation : @xmath50 which is simply bessel s equation , whose natural solutions are the bessel functions , and we choose the modified variety @xmath51 , since @xmath52 should be real .",
    "the behaviour ( for any @xmath17 ) in this regime is , after converting back to the original variables is : @xmath53    we wish to focus on the case of vanishing energy , @xmath54 , which is associated with the bcklund transformation between @xmath31 and @xmath55 .",
    "this will lead to an understanding of how @xmath52 encodes the physics of our background d ",
    "branes and fluxes . to proceed we",
    "factorize the hamiltonian as : @xmath56\\psi=0\\ ,    { \\label{eq : factorize}}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 the continuum begins at @xmath43 , corresponding to threshold bound states of zero energy . specializing to that case , we have @xmath58 , and so we deduce that ( up to a normalization ) we can always write our wavefunctions as : @xmath59 and ask what equation @xmath60 satisfies .",
    "some algebra shows that if @xmath31 , satisfies  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) , then @xmath60 satisfies : @xmath61 this is the painlev ii equation .",
    "actually , there are two choices for the constant @xmath62 , for every @xmath17 , which we ll sometimes write as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , although we will sometimes also use the fact that given either choice for @xmath62 , the other is @xmath65 .",
    "this gives two cases of interest for every choice of @xmath17 , and so we shall sometimes call these @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively : @xmath68 and so integrating and exponentiating to form the wavefunction we find that there are two choices for wavefunctions : @xmath69 this is appropriate , since the potential @xmath70 as @xmath71 and so the wavefunction should resemble the exponential tail of the airy function in that limit , and it does . meanwhile in the @xmath72 limit , where the potential vanishes to leading order , the wavefunction has a purely power law behaviour , entirely appropriate for a zero energy state . rather than",
    "have @xmath17 different wavefunctions for the @xmath17 different objects of degenerate energy ( which one ought not to expect in one dimensional quantum mechanics ) @xmath52 and @xmath73 should be thought of as describing @xmath17 bound objects , signalled by the non  exponential part of their behaviour as @xmath74 .",
    "shortly , we will further unpack the meaning of @xmath52 and @xmath73 .",
    "the form of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the associated wavefunctions @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( recovered _ via _ equation  ( [ eq : waveform ] ) ) can be exhibited numerically , and examples are given in figure  [ fig : veeplots ] ( for @xmath79 ) ,  [ fig : veebarplots ] ( for @xmath80 ) , and figure  [ fig : psiplots ] , ( for @xmath52 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "note that it becomes progressively more difficult to solve for @xmath79 ( @xmath81 ) with the given boundary conditions as @xmath17 approaches minus one ( zero ) .",
    "however , we will later define bcklund transformations ( [ eq : vbackexplicit ] ) for @xmath79 and @xmath81 that allow us to overcome this difficulty .",

    "note also that the case @xmath87 has @xmath89 to the left and @xmath90 , so we get a logarithmically divergent result for its integrated square . in a sense , this wavefunction is just on the cusp of normalizability . finally , note that for @xmath91 , the wavefunction decays as @xmath92 for large positive @xmath15 , and @xmath93 for large negative @xmath15 with similar behaviour for @xmath94 when @xmath95 .",

    "a `` superpartner '' hamiltonian can be constructed for @xmath99 by simply reversing the order of the factors , to form : @xmath100 where we have changed the label on @xmath101 to reflect the fact that we now have a new potential , which is : @xmath102 it is easy to see that @xmath17 has increased by unity .",
    "it follows from the fact that the painlev ii equation  ( [ eq : painleveii ] ) is unchanged under @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , given a solution @xmath60 to the equation , one can generate a new solution , @xmath105 to a new painleve  ii equation whose constant is @xmath106 instead of @xmath62 . by the miura map  ( [ eq : miura ] ) , this defines a new solution @xmath107 to the string equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) , but with a different value of the constant on the right hand side , which we can call @xmath108 .",
    "we can work out what the value of @xmath109 is by writing @xmath110 . since @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "in other words , @xmath113 , and the sign flip on painlev  ii allows us to construct @xmath114 from the @xmath115 function .",
    "one can eliminate @xmath60 from the above formalism to obtain a bcklund tranformation relating @xmath116 and @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "it is amusing to note that we can also construct @xmath117 by instead choosing to do the sign flip on the @xmath67 function .",
    "this gives us the equation @xmath118 , telling us that the function @xmath119 is in fact @xmath120 , now constructed from the @xmath121 funtion @xmath122 in this way we see that we can increase or decrease @xmath17 by an integer depending upon whether we act with the sign flip on @xmath66 or @xmath67 ( respectively ) , and the resulting @xmath114 or @xmath120 will be constructed from @xmath123 and @xmath121 , respectively .",

    "if @xmath52 is a wavefunction of @xmath125 with _ non  zero _ eigenvalue @xmath54 , then by multiplying the eigenvalue equation on both sides by @xmath126 , one can see that it maps under `` supersymmetry '' to a wavefunction @xmath127 of @xmath124 with the _ same _ energy @xmath54 .",
    "away from the zero energy sector therefore , @xmath125 and @xmath124 have identical spectra .",

    "it is worth remarking here that the appearance of the painlev  ii equation we ve noted here controlling the physics of the fully extended fzzt branes is different from the manner in which it appears as the physics of the 0b version of this model@xcite . in that context ,",
    "one starts with the string equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) for @xmath12 , and uses the transformation of morris@xcite ( _ i.e. _ not the miura transformation  ( [ eq : miura ] ) ) : @xmath166 to find that _ if @xmath87 _ , then @xmath167 satisfies a painlev  ii equation , with @xmath168 . if @xmath169 , the resulting equation is quite different , as there is an extra term @xmath170 .",
    "a further difference is that the type  0b free energy is the second integral of @xmath171 , not the first integral of @xmath167 .",
    "so on the one hand , these systems are clearly different , and the appearance of painlev  ii in both contexts is a coincidence , but on the other hand , it is an interesting clue as to how to make sense of the cases of @xmath172 here counts the number of d  branes , which are also instantons of the matrix model .",
    "an object with half instanton number is called a `` meron '' in field theory , and so @xmath172 , whether it be half a brane or not , deserves the name `` moron '' .",

    "the functions @xmath173 or @xmath167 do have interpretations in their own right , the first being a one  point function in the fzzt ( with background zz d  branes ) system , and the second being the square root of a two  point function of the type  0b/0a system .",
    "so we should take any relation between them as useful information .",
    "when @xmath174 , we can have @xmath168 in our painlev  ii equation determining @xmath175 . in other words , under the miura map  ( [ eq : miura ] ) , @xmath175 satisfies painlev  ii with @xmath168 , and so we should therefore use the work of ref.@xcite and interpret this as the type  0b model with no background d ",

    "this was done by establishing a direct connection ( using the miura map  ( [ eq : miura ] ) ) between the solutions of the string equations in equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) and solutions of the string equations for those unitary matrix models .",

    "recall that the bcklund transformation for our string equation s solutions @xmath12 can be derived by combining the miura map  ( [ eq : miura ] ) with the sign flip symmetry of the painlev  ii equation  ( [ eq : painleveii ] ) , resulting in , for example : @xmath208 recall that for a given value of @xmath17 , @xmath31 is related by the miura map to the function @xmath209 ( which solves painlev  ii with a constant @xmath111 ) and also to @xmath210 ( which solves painlev  ii with a constant @xmath211 ) . from the discussion under equation  ( [ eq : newpotential ] ) , and as is clear on the diagram in figure  [ fig : backlund ] , we also have the relations : @xmath212 which shall be useful later .",

    "recall from the discussion of supersymmetric quantum mechanics that the miura map arises from factorising @xmath101 in the form : @xmath218 we found that a solution of this equation is of course just @xmath219 , where @xmath220 , since function @xmath221 clearly satisfies @xmath222 .",

    "integer @xmath241 to those of integer @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "amusingly , we now observe that it fits rather nicely with the fact that in section  [ sec : setting ] we noted that the wave equation ( [ eq : waveagain ] ) in the @xmath242 limit is in fact ( after a simple change of variables ) bessel s equation with @xmath243 .",
    "so it is not an analogy for @xmath79 ( in that regime ) but the _ identical _ system !",
    "these results are of course consistent : @xmath244 so , in many ways it is as if @xmath60 is an fzzt brane and @xmath215 is an anti - fzzt brane ! the only way that this is consistent under charge conjugation @xmath245 ( under which the physics should be invariant ) is for integer @xmath17 .",

    "we have again ignored the interaction term between the two branes here , so this ` annihilation ' would only be correct if the branes had no interaction with each other .",
    "but it is interesting and worthy of note nonetheless .",
    "another well  known structure in the theory of integrable systems is the @xmath248function .",
    "the significance of the @xmath248function in the context of the minimal string theories was noticed long ago in refs.@xcite , where it was shown that the kdv flows together with the string equation was equivalent to a family of virasoro constraints on the square root of the `` closed '' string theory s ( what we should now think of as @xmath87 ) partition function .",
    "this square root is the @xmath248function of the kdv hierarchy , and we have @xmath249 where the @xmath250 are given in terms of products and derivatives with respect to the @xmath189 , and hence the virasoro constraints can be thought of as an infinite family of relationships between correlation functions of the operators to which the @xmath189 couple .    in fact , there is always a natural _ pair _ of @xmath248functions for the kdv / mkdv system in general , and one might wonder where the other one fits into our story .",
    "some remarks about this were already made at the end of ref.@xcite , and using the results of ref.@xcite , where the complete structure of the virasoro constraints ( when open string ( and flux ) sectors are included ) for @xmath169 were presented , together with the insights gained with the results of the present paper , we can complete the story .",
    "the notation that is usually used for the pair is @xmath251 and @xmath252 , but for out purposes it is probably better to , for a given value of @xmath17 , use the notation @xmath253 and @xmath254 , as will become clear .",
    "then , the partition function of our full string theory at @xmath17 is given by the product : @xmath255 while the partition function of the fzzt d ",
    "brane probe is the ratio : @xmath256 let us see how this relates to the functions @xmath31 and @xmath66 .",
    "we take the logarithm and the second derivative of the partition function to obtain @xmath31 , and the first derivative for @xmath66 : @xmath257 a little algebra then shows that the combinations @xmath258 do indeed give the functions @xmath116 and @xmath114 , if the following relation holds : @xmath259 it is equivalent to the writing of another partition function : @xmath260 from which the quantity @xmath261 may be derived from a second derivative of the associated free energy : @xmath262 this latter partition function is just that of the original double scaled unitary matrix model@xcite .",
    "returning to the matter of the virasoro constraints , it was noted in ref.@xcite that in the presence of @xmath17 , the @xmath263 constraint would be modified by a @xmath17dependent constant .",
    "while the constant was not known , the difference between @xmath263 acting on @xmath253 and @xmath263 acting on @xmath254 was expected to be @xmath264 .",

    ", we get for example ( as @xmath71 ) : @xmath272 now without question this expansion is a mess . on the face of it , there is some difficulty in interpreting these terms in the familiar language of string perturbation theory .",
    "it is in fact possible , and the result is quite elegant .    a clue to what to expect is the knowledge that @xmath54 controls two things . on the one hand",
    "it is the coefficient of a boundary length operator , and on the other hand , it is the distance form the tip of the fzzt d",
    " brane probe at @xmath273 to the @xmath17 zz d  branes located at @xmath274 .",
    "so our worldsheet expansion should make sense in these terms .",
    "that @xmath54 is a boundary operator can be seen from the fact@xcite that the expectation value of loops of length @xmath275 can be represented in terms of the hamiltonian as : @xmath276 and so an @xmath101eigenvalue @xmath54 gives it a dependence @xmath277 .",
    "so @xmath54 couples to an operator on the boundary which measures loop length .",
    "since it is a boundary operator , one can expect therefore that it will appear in diagrams with boundary at a given genus with any number of insertions on that boundary .",
    "so at every order in string perturbation theory , @xmath54 should control an infinite number of terms corresponding to summing over all ways the operator can act on each boundary in that diagram .",
    "armed with that clue , a re  examination of the expansion above yields a useful rewriting .",
    "for example one infinite set of terms can be written at disc order as follows : @xmath278 we see that remarkably , the series of terms can be resummed into a remarkably simple expression . there is a simple interpretation of this latter result .",
    "the result integrates once to give the disc contribution to the free energy of the probe d  brane . for this @xmath176 model , to leading order in string perturbation theory , the parameter @xmath15 already couples naturally to the boundary length ( since in the hamiltonian , @xmath279 , and so this follows from equation  ( [ eq : cont ] ) ) , and so switching on @xmath54 in this case simply renormalizes @xmath15 additively .",
    "we can write the disc contribution to the free energy from this , after integrating once and dividing by @xmath18 : @xmath280 where we have introduced the notation @xmath281 to denote the contribution to the free energy from a diagram with @xmath282 fzzt d ",

    "after some algebra , the infinite seires of @xmath54 contributions can be resummed , with the result : @xmath285 the diagram with 1 fzzt d  brane and one handle also gives a result of the same form , with the total contribution being : @xmath286 turning to diagrams with both fzzt and zz boundaries , let us see what happens to the three  string vertices .",
    "we get , for the case of 2 fzzt and 1 zz , the result : @xmath287 while the case of 1 fzzt and 2 zz yields : @xmath288 the pattern emerging is clear .",
    "surfaces have an extra factor of @xmath289 for every boundary that ends on a zz d  brane .",

    "the contribution from four fzzt boundaries mixes with that of the diagram with two fzzt boundaries and one handle to give , after resumming : @xmath290 more interesting are the cases mixing the different types of boundaries .",

    "a similar equation to ( [ eq : genrel ] ) holds in the case of @xmath284 non - zero providing that one or other of @xmath283 and @xmath282 is zero instead .",

    "we mean that , a surface s specific contribution to the free energy should be able to be isolated , up to an overall constant .",
    "a natural hypothesis arises by considering the diagrams associated with @xmath312 as in some way _ fundamental _ ( see figure [ fig : fundamental ] ) ; and then trying to build handled diagrams by _ stitching _ these fundamental diagrams together by joining boundaries .",

    "string surfaces @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",
    "our guess is therefore : @xmath326 comparison with equations ( [ eq : resuma ] ) yields the result @xmath327 .",
    "moving on to the combined @xmath328 and @xmath329 term we predict : @xmath330 the justification for this ansatz is that it contains every pair of constituent surfaces that could possibly contribute . again",
    ", our prediction can be realised with @xmath331 .",
    "at the next level we have : @xmath332 this time we find that @xmath333 .",
    "we can now see a possible pattern emerging amongst the @xmath334 : @xmath335 testing this conjecture for the combined @xmath336 and @xmath337 term we find that it does indeed hold , with @xmath338 .",
    "so it seems that we have uncovered a general rule : @xmath339 the origin of the binomial factors here is not known .",
    "it may relate to the number of ways that the constituent worldsheets can be stitched together , but we have not been able to how this would work .",
    "notice that upon including the @xmath15 derivatives in ( [ eq : genrule ] ) , by replacing the @xmath340 with @xmath341 everywhere , the resultant equation is reminiscent of the liebniz rule for the multiple differentiation of a product .",
    "note also that it seems that we can now associate the @xmath342 as being the coefficients of the @xmath343 and the @xmath344 as being the coefficients of the @xmath345 .",
    "matters are not this simple however , as will be shown when we analyze other surfaces below .",
    "we return now to the combined @xmath328 and @xmath329 term .",
    "since the handled term here fits into the @xmath346 subclass analogous to the @xmath320 subclass explored above , we make the natural guess that it can be constructed from exclusively fzzt - fzzt stitchings .",
    "it turns out that this works providing that we add in an extra term proportional to @xmath347 .",
    "this can be thought of as self - stitching of two zz boundaries on the worldsheet to form a handle .",
    "we find : @xmath348 where @xmath349 .",
    "this seems to be the only sensible choice : all other schemes we tried yielded coefficients as unilluminating as those in the original resummation equations ( [ eq : resuma ] ) ,  ( [ eq : resumb ] ) and  ( [ eq : resumc ] ) . we can make some sense of this result if consider the action of the transformation @xmath350 on the resummed contributions .",
    "we will denote the action of this transformation on a surface @xmath351 as @xmath352 .",
    "note that this transformation is defined at the level of the @xmath353 themselves , so the relation @xmath354 is not trivially satisfied !",
    "indeed , we can immediately see a counter example using ( [ eq : genrel2 ] ) : @xmath355 .",
    "these @xmath356 terms are from the background @xmath12 expansion of course : perhaps terms from the @xmath79 expansion do satisfy @xmath354 ? from ( [ eq : genrel ] ) we clearly see that surfaces without handles certainly do .",
    "by requiring that @xmath357 we can unambiguously separate the handled terms from the non - handled terms ( using ( [ eq:121 ] ) and ( [ eq:211 ] ) ) : @xmath358 and , as such : @xmath359 this would explain the appearance of the self - stitched @xmath347 term in ( [ eq:121 ] ) . using the same procedure we can render the components of ( [ eq:111 ] ) in manifestly invariant form with @xmath360 : @xmath361 the @xmath322 term here now represents two self - stitched surfaces ; plus one of each of fzzt - fzzt and zz - zz stitchings between the fundamental surfaces @xmath362 and @xmath325 .",
    "whether other surfaces are also invariant under the @xmath363 operation remains to be seen . at higher orders things",
    "get more difficult because of mixing of many different terms with various numbers of handles",
    ". the pattern can not be binomial in every case because for many surfaces there are more possible fundamental stitchings that can contribute to the free energy than there are binomial coefficients .",
    "so far we have not been able to complete the elegant picture presented above for arbitrary @xmath351 , though it is likely that the final solution will be extremely simple and symmetrical .",
    "this is work in progress .",
    "however , if all the surfaces making up @xmath79 are indeed invariant under @xmath364 , then we can automatically generate the @xmath365 series from the @xmath366 series ( [ eq : genrule ] ) .",
    "regrettably , the next term in the @xmath365 series , @xmath367 , also mixes with a two  handle term , @xmath368 ; so without knowing the appropriate two ",
    "handle rules we have been unable to test our conjecture .",
    "let us now turn to the regime @xmath72 . recall that in the case @xmath43 we saw that the physics arranged itself into that of a probe fzzt d ",
    "brane , now in the background of @xmath17 units of flux .",
    "now we wish to use equation  ( [ eq : miuramore ] ) to develop an expansion for @xmath79 at non ",
    "zero @xmath54 , and examine its properties .",
    "the expansion we obtain is :    @xmath369    once again , we have a remarkable mess , and it is arguably even worse than the one we had for large positive @xmath15 at non  zero @xmath54 . very interesting",
    "is the fact that this expansion does not reduce to the expansion  ( [ eq : formsofv ] ) that we had at @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath43 if is singular . we shall have to understand the physics of this .    to construct the free energy of our probe ( the logarithm of the wavefunction ) we are instructed by equation  ( [ eq : waveform ] ) ( as we were previously ) to integrate once and",
    "divide by @xmath18 .",
    "having done so , we find that the first few terms are : @xmath370 which fits nicely with the asymptotic form of the wavefunction following from modified bessel functions , observed in equation  ( [ eq : asymptoticbessel ] ) . now , nowhere do we see a natural occurrence of the dimensionless coupling @xmath371 , nor do we see its renormalized cousin @xmath372 , so we appear to have a puzzle .    the resolution is simply that we need not expect either @xmath373 or @xmath293 to appear as the natural stringy expansion parameter in this situation .",
    "part of the reason is that @xmath54 and @xmath15 appear very differently in this regime as compared to the large positive @xmath15 regime . there , even when @xmath54 was zero , at tree level there was a natural parameter which gave boltzmann weight to loops of length @xmath275 , and this was @xmath15 , the tree level part of @xmath12 .",
    "introducing @xmath54 brings it in to perform a role already performed by @xmath15 ( at tree level ) and so it simply shifts @xmath15 as we have seen . in this large negative @xmath15 regime , we have completely different behaviour .",
    "the potential @xmath12 _ vanishes _ at leading order and so at that order there is nothing weighting the length of loops when @xmath43 .",
    "so when @xmath54 is non  zero , there is now a weighting parameter at tree level , and so the natural loop expansion that it controls need not have anything to do what that of the @xmath43 case . furthermore , it must be disconnected from any expansion developed in the @xmath43 case since the weight @xmath374 allows loops of infinite length to dominate when @xmath43 which will not yield a good expansion .",
    "an expansion in @xmath54 should be expected to be singular there , and this is what we have seen . to handle physics at @xmath43",
    ", we should expect to resum at finite @xmath54 to the full @xmath375 and then , setting @xmath43 , develop a new expansion in a different parameter .",
    "this is the origin of the second and fourth expressions in equation  ( [ eq : formsofv ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , we shall therefore not expect that the natural expansion parameter is @xmath373 or @xmath293 . instead , an examination of the expression for the free energy shows that the natural expansion parameter is : @xmath376 notice that this is also a dimensionless combination of the important parameters in the problem , a combination which is not available when @xmath54 vanishes . inspired by the success of our exploration of the large positive @xmath15 regime , we write our free energy as : @xmath377    { \\label{eq : finalfree}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rather pleasingly",
    ", we see that in this new expansion we again have worldsheets corresponding to a probe brane in a background quantified by @xmath17 .",
    "it is curious that the expansion of @xmath173 manages to resum so nicely , and it is worthwhile to investigate this phenomenon a little more closely .",
    "to do so , we again appeal to ( [ eq : miuramore ] ) .",
    "let @xmath378 note that ( [ eq : expansion ] ) immediately shows that for @xmath71 , @xmath379 and for @xmath72 , @xmath380 it is apparent that for @xmath381 , @xmath382 where the @xmath383 are independent of @xmath15 . note that for the negative @xmath15 expansion , @xmath384 .",
    "we are thus able to write ( [ eq : miuramore ] ) as @xmath385 which must hold for each order of @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , this gives @xmath386 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for @xmath381 , @xmath387 now , for @xmath71 , @xmath388 , so @xmath389 .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath390 will take a specific form , @xmath391 where the @xmath392 and @xmath393 are integer or half - integer and the @xmath394 are functions of the @xmath344 . to obtain the contribution to the free energy , we want to divide by @xmath18 and integrate once .",
    "based on the rules we introduced above , the contributions to the free energy are manifestly expressions in integer and half  integer powers of @xmath15 and @xmath395 , so we would expect these integrals to yield expressions that also have this form .",
    "in general , integration will produce expressions with the correct @xmath15 and @xmath395 dependence , but they will also have nontrivial logarithmic dependence . on the outset , this is discouraging because we have developed no rules for producing logarithmic contributions to the free energy . but upon closer investigation we notice an interesting pattern : the @xmath344 conspire in such a way as to exactly cancel the logarthmic dependence in the integral . for example",
    ", in the integral of @xmath396 , the coefficient of the log term turns out to be @xmath397 . but",
    "( [ eq : coeffbi ] ) shows that @xmath398 , exactly the relationship needed to cancel this coefficient .",
    "we have verified explicitly that all log dependence cancels up to @xmath399 .",
    "we turn next to the @xmath72 expansion . in this regime ,",
    "@xmath400 , so @xmath401 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath384 and @xmath402 , which suggests that an expression for @xmath390 will inevitably depend on the parity of @xmath241 .",
    "the first few terms are : @xmath403 it is clear that there is a pattern emerging in the powers of @xmath15 and @xmath54 .",
    "it can be proved by induction that the general form for @xmath390 is : @xmath404 where the @xmath394 and @xmath405 are constants to be determined by the @xmath344 . unlike the case in the positive @xmath15 expansion , the @xmath15dependence here is trivial so we can easily integrate to obtain each term s contribution to the free energy . simplifying , we find that @xmath406 where the @xmath407 are again functions of the @xmath344 , and @xmath408 if @xmath241 is even and @xmath409 if @xmath241 is odd .",
    "setting @xmath410 allows us to write the free energy as : @xmath411 it is interesting to see a new stringy perturbative regime arise for non  zero @xmath54 , with a string coupling @xmath412 that is distinct from the previously identified string couplings , @xmath413 .",
