    "emission lines arising from transitions in fex have been widely detected in solar extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) spectra ( see , for example , dere 1978 ; thomas & neupert 1994 ) . jordan ( 1965 ) first proposed the use of fex lines to determine the electron density in the solar corona , while jordan ( 1966 ) employed euv transitions of fex and other fe ions to derive both the electron density and coronal fe abundance .",
    "since then , several authors have undertaken analyses of the solar euv spectrum of fex , including for example nussbaumer ( 1976 ) and bhatia & doschek ( 1995 ) . to date , the most complete study is probably that of del zanna , berrington & mason ( 2004 ) , which also provides an excellent review of previous work on fex .",
    "the theoretical line ratios calculated by del zanna et al .",
    "employ radiative rates generated with the superstructure code by either bhatia & doschek ( 1995 ) or themselves . for electron impact excitation rates , they use results for transitions among the lowest 31 fine - structure levels of fex calculated with the breit - pauli rmatrx code , either by pelan & berrington ( 2001 ) or once again by themselves .",
    "recently , aggarwal & keenan ( 2004 , 2005 ) have used the fully relativistic grasp and dirac rmatrx codes to calculate radiative rates and electron impact excitation cross sections , respectively , for transitions among the energetically lowest 90 fine - structure levels of fex . in this paper",
    "we use these results , plus additional atomic data presented here , to generate theoretical emission - line ratios for fex , and compare these with high resolution spectra from the solar extreme - ultraviolet research telescope and spectrograph ( serts ) .",
    "our aims are threefold , namely to ( i ) assess the importance of blending in the serts observations , ( ii ) detect new fex emission lines , and ( iii ) identify the best fex line ratios for use as electron density diagnostics .",
    "this work is of particular relevance due to the recent launch of the _ hinode _ mission , which has on board the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) , covering the 170211  and 246292  wavelength ranges ( culhane et al .",
    "2007 ) , similar to the serts spectral coverage of 170225  and 235450  ( thomas & neupert 1994 ) .",
    "it is clearly important that emission lines observed by the eis are fully assessed , and the best diagnostics identified .",
    "serts provides the ideal testbed for this , due to its larger wavelength coverage , allowing more lines from the same species to be detected and compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "furthermore , the best serts spectral resolution is about 0.03  [ full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) ] , obtained for the 170225  wavelength range observed in second - order ( brosius , davila & thomas 1998a ) , which is a full factor of two better than the 0.0650.075  resolution available from eis ( young et al .",
    "hence the serts data sets should allow emission features to be resolved and assessed which are blended in eis spectra .",
    "indeed , this is illustrated by our previous work on fexiii ( keenan et al .",
    "2007 ) , where we resolved the 203.79 and 203.83  features which are blended in eis observations ( young et al . 2007 ) .",
    "serts has had a total of 10 successful flights over the period 19822000 , each featuring a somewhat different set of optical components and observing targets .",
    "we have selected data from two of these for analysis here , as they provide the most complete sequence of well - observed fex emission lines .",
    "the flight on 1989 may 5 ( henceforth referred to as serts89 ) carried a standard gold - coated toroidal diffraction grating , and was the first to observe a strong solar active region , noaa 5464 .",
    "it detected hundreds of first - order emission lines in the 235450  wavelength range , plus dozens of features spanning 170225 , which appeared in second - order among the 340450  first - order lines ( thomas & neupert 1994 ) .",
    "the spectrum was recorded on kodak 10107 emulsion , at a spectral resolution of 5080m   ( fwhm ) in first - order , and a spatial resolution of approximately 7 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "this combination of high spectral resolution , strong signal , and broad wavelength coverage remains unsurpassed even today as the best available data set for investigating imaged solar emission features over the full wavelength range of 235450 , and hence are used in the present paper .",
    "subsequent serts flights employed either a multilayer - coated diffraction grating or ccd - detector arrays which provided important technical advantages , but which also restricted the spectral bandpass that could be covered , making their data less suitable for the present study ( see keenan et al . 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "the one exception was the flight on 1995 may 15 ( henceforth referred to as serts95 ) which incorporated a multilayer - coated toroidal diffraction grating that enhanced its sensitivity to second - order features in the 170225  wavelength range ( brosius et al",
    ". 1998a ) .",
    "it observed active region noaa 7870 , again using kodak 10107 emulsion , and had an improved spatial resolution of approximately 5 arcsec .",
    "its unique shortwave multilayer coating led to the detection of many second - order emission lines not seen on previous serts flights ( thomas & neupert 1994 ; brosius et al .",
    "1996 ) , and furthermore obtained the highest spectral resolution ( 0.03  fhwm ) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this wavelength range .",
    "the serts95 data therefore provide the best observations for investigating fex emission lines in the 170225  region , and hence are employed in this paper .",
    "further details of the serts95 observations , and the wavelength and absolute flux calibration procedures employed in the data reduction , may be found in brosius et al .",
    "( 1998a , b ) .",
    "similar information for the serts89 spectrum is available from thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) .",
    "we note that although the relative intensity calibration curves in both cases involved fitting to calculations of insensitive line - ratio pairs , fex lines made up less than 10%  of the points utilized in those procedures .",
    "furthermore , detailed comparisons of line ratio calculations for many ions with serts measurements have revealed generally very good agreement between theory and observation , providing support for the serts intensity calibrations ( see , for example , keenan et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) . thus ,",
    "even without fully independent intensity calibrations , the serts results still provide a valid test for the new fex calculations presented here .",
    "it should also be noted that the serts95 first - order calibration curve was extrapolated from its fitted range of 238336  to cover its complete bandpass . hence there is some extra uncertainty in the intensities of lines with wavelengths greater than 340  measured from this flight .",
    "however , no such problem exists with the serts89 measurements of these lines .",
    "we have searched for fex emission lines in the serts89 and serts95 spectra using the detections of thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) and brosius et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , supplemented with those from other sources , including the nist database , the latest version ( v5.2 ) of the chianti database ( dere et al .",

    "2006 ) , the atomic line list of van hoof , peter / atomic/ ] and in particular the excellent summary of line identifications by del zanna et al . ( 2004 ) .",
    "the latter provides not only a comprehensive list of wavelengths for well - observed fex transitions , but also indicates alternative wavelengths where previous identifications are not consistent with their conclusions . in table 1",
    "we list the fex transitions found in the serts89 and serts95 spectra , along with their measured wavelengths .",
    "we also indicate possible blending features or alternative identifications as suggested by thomas & neupert or brosius et al . in their original line lists .    [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath11from datla et al .",
    "+ @xmath12present theoretical line ratios and those from chianti calculated for the measured plasma parameters .",
    "our comparison of theoretical fex emission - line intensity ratios with solar active region spectra from the serts 1989 and 1995 flights reveals generally very good agreement between theory and experiment , with several features identified for the first time in the serts data sets , including fex 193.72 , 220.26 and 324.73 , plus fexi 201.56  and the feix / x blend at 175.48 .",
    "in addition , the 195.32  transition of fex is detected for the first time ( to our knowledge ) in an astronomical source .",
    "we find that the ratios 175.27/174.53 and 175.27/177.24 provide the best fex electron density diagnostics , as they involve lines which are strong and free from blends , are close in wavelength and the ratios are highly n@xmath5sensitive .",
    "should these lines not be available , then the 257.25/345.74 ratio may be employed as a diagnostic , although this requires an accurate determination of the instrument intensity calibration over a relatively large wavelength range . however ,",
    "if the weak 324.73  line is reliably detected , then the use of 324.73/345.74 or 257.25/324.73 is recommended in preference to 257.25/345.74 .",
