    "the recent spate of discoveries of exotic heavy mesons has engendered much speculation about their dynamical origins .",
    "in particular , the manifestly exotic charged charmonium and bottomonium states have revived old controversies regarding the possible existence of molecular ( loosely bound mesonic colour singlets ) , tetraquark ( tightly bound @xmath8 colour singlets ) , and diquonium ( bound diquarks , @xmath9 ) states and how these may be experimentally distinguished@xcite .    in the light quark sector speculation about multiquark states began more than 40 years ago with a claim that a dynamical scalar isoscalar resonance in @xmath10 scattering is predicted by current algebra , unitarity , and crossing symmetry@xcite .",
    "a related idea was proposed by jaffe , who noted that @xmath8 states could make up a scalar nonet ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis has been a rich source of ideas and controversy ever since .",
    "only recently , with the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , has it been generally accepted that a @xmath11 resonance even exists .",
    "the interpretation of these states , and the existence of the strange analogue state , @xmath12 , remain open issues . in the intervening",
    "decades the idea of multiquark states has been applied to a plethora of additional states , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17)@xcite , @xmath18 ( @xmath19)@xcite , @xmath20 ( @xmath21)@xcite , and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "the extension of the multiquark angst to the heavy quark sector began in 2004 with the discovery of the @xmath24@xcite .",
    "its proximity to @xmath25 threshold and decay properties have led to the general acceptance that it is a weakly bound system of @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons@xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath24 is a prototype for molecular states in the heavy quark sector .",
    "subsequent experimental effort has revealed many new resonances , all of which enjoy  or suffer  molecular , tetraquark , or diquonium interpretations . amongst these",
    "are the @xmath28@xcite , @xmath29 and @xmath30@xcite , @xmath31@xcite , @xmath32@xcite , @xmath33@xcite , @xmath34@xcite , and the @xmath35@xcite .",
    "this paper focusses on four of these states : the manifestly exotic @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 states were discovered by belle@xcite in @xmath36 and @xmath37 via their decays to @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the masses and widths of these resonances were determined to be @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev , @xmath43 mev respectively .",
    "an examination of angular distributions heavily favours the spin - parity assignment @xmath44 for both states .",
    "the @xmath2 was discovered by the besiii collaboration@xcite in @xmath45 in the charged mode @xmath46 .",
    "the reported mass and width are @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 mev .",
    "the quantum numbers of the state are not known .",
    "the @xmath3 was observed by besiii in @xmath49 at @xmath50 gev@xcite and in @xmath51 at a variety of energies@xcite .",
    "its mass was determined to be 4026.3(4.5 ) mev and 4022.9(2.8 ) mev in the respective experiments .",
    "the measured widths were 24.8(9.5 ) mev and 7.9(3.7 ) mev .",
    "the proximity of the @xmath4 states to @xmath52 ( 10604 mev ) and @xmath53 ( 10650 mev ) threshold has inspired speculation that heavy isovector analogues of the @xmath24 state have been discovered@xcite . similarly , the @xmath2 is close to @xmath25 threshold at 3879 mev , while the @xmath3 is close of @xmath54 threshold at 4020 mev .",
    "it is , however , important to observe that these resonances lie _ above _ their respective thresholds , thus the possibility that they are kinematical effects must be considered .",
    "this hypothesis has been explored before by bugg@xcite , who considered triangle diagrams for the process @xmath55 .",
    "this diagram proceeds via an @xmath56 vertex coupled with @xmath57 and @xmath58 vertices .",
    "the loop diagram was then modelled with a simple form that assumed a scale driven by pion exchange .",
    "no attempt to fit experimental data was made .",
    "a similar model was constructed by chen _",
    "et al . _ and applied to the process @xmath59@xcite .",
    "the model amplitude had 10 parameters , which enabled a good fit to the dalitz plot , thereby explaining the @xmath2 as a threshold effect .",
    "the cusp hypothesis is developed further in the following sections where a simple and consistent model that incorporates thresholds is constructed .",
    "it is found that all of the relevant experimental results can be explained as cusp effects in a natural fashion with two free parameters .",
    "furthermore , it is argued that the lack of a @xmath60 signal in the electroweak decay @xmath7 is a clear indication that the @xmath60s are indeed an effect due to a coupled channel cusp .",
    "the model predicts that both @xmath60  states \" may be visible in @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "similar cusp states are predicted at 10695 mev and 10745 mev in @xmath63 due to @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 virtual continuua .",
    "the hypothesis is that coupled channel effects can generate signals in dalitz plots that mimic resonances .",
    "a simple model that incorporates this idea can be constructed by considering the crossed channel @xmath67 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - cusp ] .",
    "notice that the diagram applies equally well to the reaction @xmath68 with the replacement of the intermediate particles with their charmed analogues ; it also applies to @xmath69 if the initial vector particle is replaced with a pseudoscalar .",
    "of course , the diagram should be summed over all intermediate states consistent with the quantum numbers of the reaction .",
    "scattering.,width=226 ]    it is possible to construct an effective field theory to describe this process and evaluate the ensuing diagrams .",
    "for example , the vertex shown in the figure can be modelled as    = -i ^^a b^i b^j*_. however the isospin matrices merely contribute an overall factor , and the momentum dependence induced by spin - dependence in the propagators reduces to a polynomial in @xmath70 .",
    "neither of these effects are central to the physics we pursue , which is the presence of a right hand cut and elastic scattering suppression mediated by the hadronic scale , @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore eschew the effective field theory approach and simply model the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig - cusp ] by writing its imaginary part as    _ ( s ) = _ i k_i^1+_i+_i f_i(s ) f_i(s ) with k_i^2 = . here",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 refer to incoming and outgoing channels , @xmath74 is a virtual channel consisting of hadrons with masses @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the lowest wave associated with the vertex @xmath78 , which we assume saturates the given subprocess .",
    "the bound state nature of the scattering hadrons is accounted for by a suitably chosen form factor . in the following",
    "we shall employ the simple ansatz    f_i = g_i ( -s/2_i^2 ) .",
    "it is , of course , a simple matter to incorporate nodes or any other structure that is important to the process in question .",
    "the scale @xmath79 is governed by @xmath71 .",
    "we now invoke two - body unitarity and the assumption that no resonances contribute to the reaction to obtain the complete analytic  self energy \" portion of the scattering amplitude :    _ ( s ) = _",

    "the simple bubble structure of the model permits unitarisation if this is deemed necessary . in this case",
    "we expect the hadronic rescattering amplitudes to be small so that unitarisation is not important .",
    "it is also not relevant to demonstrating the effects of coupled channel cusps and form factors .    finally , for this mechanism to be relevant it is necessary to demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via the loop in question .",
    "this demonstration , of course , depends on the reaction under consideration , hence it will be deferred to the next section where different processes are considered in turn .",
    "since the purpose of this computation is not a detailed analysis of experimental results , a fit to the dalitz plot densities will not be attempted .",
    "any fit would also depend sensitively on @xmath10 dynamics in the dalitz plot , which is not of concern here .",
    "thus figs .",
    "[ fig - belle ]  [ fig - bess2 ] present direct computations of the @xmath83 invariant mass distribution and plot these with relevant experimental data .    under these conditions",

    "analgous quantities apply to the charmed sector . in the following",
    "we shall set    g^2_nbb^ * = g_(5s):b|b^ * g_(ns ) : b|b^ * with a similar expression for @xmath92 .",
    "although this parameter set is dramatically smaller than those typically used to fit the dalitz plot distribution , it is still too extensive for our purposes .",
    "we therefore make drastic , but reasonable , further assumptions : @xmath93 gev for _ all _ channels and @xmath94 = 0.9 @xmath95 @xmath96 , for all @xmath97 .",
    "the latter relationship simply means that the @xmath52 channel is slightly reduced in strength compared to the @xmath53 channel .",
    "these parameters were obtained with a rough fit to the @xmath98 invariant mass distribution of the @xmath99 dalitz plot , as shown below , and will be called the  canonical fit \" in the following .",
    "finally , the remaining free product of couplings is fixed by normalising to the experimental data . notice",
    "that if the model is accurate it should be possible to fit results obtained from a single experiment , like @xmath100 for @xmath101 , with a _",
    "single _ normalization .",
    "this provides an important test of the formalism .",
    "we now seek to compare the predictions of the cusp model with the belle data for @xmath102 , with @xmath97 = 1 , 2 , 3@xcite .",
    "the first issue to address is the relative importance of the @xmath52 loop diagram to the decay process . in this case",
    "we can turn to direct measurements of the couplings of the @xmath103 to various final states@xcite .",
    "it is thereby learned that the @xmath103 decays to states with no open bottom a scant 3.8% of the time .",
    "alternatively , decays to @xmath104 amount to 57.3% of the @xmath103 width , while those to @xmath105 account for an additional 8.3% .",
    "direct coupling to @xmath106 is always less than @xmath107 .",
    "it appears that the dominant diagram is one in which the @xmath103 fluctuates into a @xmath104 pair which then couples to @xmath106 .",
    "this represents a bubble in the @xmath108 channel , which thus contributes an approximately constant background .",
    "it therefore appears likely that the most important diagrams with structure are those coupling to @xmath105 , as postulated in this approach .",
    "our first comparison will be to the reaction @xmath109 because this process displays little interference from pion dynamics , and thus provides a relatively clean starting point for making comparisons .",

    "this parameter set was called the  canonical fit \" above .",

    "this process occurs via the left hand vertex of fig .",
    "[ fig - cusp ] and is explained as a threshold enhancement .",
    "threshold enhancements occur whenever a channel opens and the phase space which grows like @xmath158 is moderated by a form factor that decreases rapidly with scale @xmath159 ; these are therefore generic features of any hadronic interaction",
    ".      an important element of the case for cusp effects in @xmath161 decay and @xmath162 processes is that coupling to open flavour channels is preferred .",
    "the argument for this has already been made for @xmath161 decay . in the case of @xmath162",
    ", open - flavour dominance can be understood as a consequence of hadronisation wherein charm and anticharm ( or bottom and antibottom ) quarks have opposite and large momenta in the parent rest frame .",
    "the resulting flux tube rapidly creates a light quark pair and the system evolves into @xmath163 mesons moving back - to - back . if these @xmath163 mesons have high relative momentum they will leave the interaction region and little final state rescattering will occur .",
    "if they have low relative momentum ( such as for @xmath31 decay ) rescattering can be important .",
    "an intricate interplay of all of these effects occurs in electroweak @xmath160 decays , which thereby provide an intriguing entree into the physics of cusp effects .",
    "consider the process @xmath164 : in principle , a @xmath2 and @xmath3 should be visible in the final state @xmath165 invariant mass distribution . in more detail ,",
    "the amplitudes that contribute to @xmath166 are the colour - suppressed decay wherein the produced charm and anti - charm quarks form a @xmath140 , which is called the  direct \" amplitude here ( fig . [ fig - decays-1 ] , left panel ) , and indirect amplitudes that form @xmath163 mesons and must rescatter to make the final state .",
    "three main topologies for indirect amplitudes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - decays-1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - decays-2 ] .",
    "the first two occur via a colour - enhanced electroweak process with subsequent hadronisation , while the third ( right panel fig .",
    "[ fig - decays-2 ] ) hadronises the colour - suppressed process .",
    "the rescattering required to produce @xmath167 inhibits all of the indirect amplitudes , but this is countered by an enhancement with respect to the direct amplitude . in the colour - enhanced case , this is simply the factor @xmath168 .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath163 meson momenta are dominantly opposite in the @xmath160 meson rest frame , and therefore the @xmath163 mesons have a suppressed final state interaction .",
    "alternatively , in the wavefunction - enhanced process the @xmath169 system recoils against the pion and final state rescattering can be strong .",
    "although the rescattering diagram is suppressed by the final state interactions it is also enhanced with respect to the direct production diagram because it is difficult for the outgoing charm quarks to form a @xmath140 meson . indeed , if one ignored the @xmath170 quark in the transition @xmath171 , the charm quarks would have momenta of about 2 gev in the @xmath172 rest frame .",
    "an explicit calculation with a constituent quark model then gives a @xmath140 formation probability of less than 1% .",
    "a more detailed calculation can be made by evaluating the average charm quark momentum in the @xmath173 dalitz plot .",
    "the result in the @xmath174 rest frame is @xmath175 gev .",
    "this implies a capture probability of approximately 25% , which means that the rate for the direct diagram is suppressed by a factor of 16 with respect to the rescattering diagram .",
    "this estimate can be confirmed by noting that typical branching fractions for @xmath176 are comparable to those for @xmath177 . furthermore , @xmath178 whereas @xmath179 .",
    "thus it appears that the indirect wavefunction - enhanced channel is an order of magnitude or more larger than the direct channel for reactions in which it contributes .",
    "the electroweak decay @xmath180 has recently been measured by the lhcb collaboration@xcite . while the main point of this research was an attempted analysis of the structure of the @xmath11 and @xmath13 light mesons , a distribution of events in @xmath181 invariant mass was also published .",
    "a comparison of the analogous distribution from besiii reveals a stark difference : although the distributions are over nearly identical mass ranges , there is no sign of the @xmath2 or @xmath3 in the lhcb data .",
    "this is difficult to understand , because , other than quantum numbers , there is little difference between @xmath182 ( @xmath31 decay where the @xmath2 is seen ) and @xmath183 ( @xmath160 decay , where the @xmath60 is not seen ) .            the process @xmath184 can occur via the direct and colour - enhanced indirect mechanisms .",
    "since no @xmath60 is observed , one must conclude that colour - enhanced rescattering is weak and hence no cusp effects are visible .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the recent measurement of @xmath185 by lhcb@xcite , which finds no evidence of a @xmath186 resonance .",
    "if loops dominated this process cusp  states \" should be visible at 3980 mev ( @xmath187 + @xmath188 ) and 4125 mev ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "it appears that colour - enhanced indirect processes do not give rise to cusp effects .",
    "the remaining possibility is wavefunction - enhanced rescattering , which contributes to reactions such as @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 .",
    "it is thus of interest to examine these reactions to gain insight into the nonperturbative effects being considered here , and qcd in general .",
    "it has been argued that the appearance of open flavour thresholds in intermediate states is sufficient to generate signals that mimic resonances that are consistent with the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "model assumptions are that lowest partial waves dominate a given amplitude and that a simple form factor controlled by hadronic scales is sufficient to describe relevant subprocesses .",
    "further simplifications that are not necessary , but add strength to the conclusions , were that a universal scale describes all form factors ( except when @xmath193 or @xmath150 mesons are in the final state ) and that all couplings are approximately equal .",
    "the resulting description of 13 peaks in 7 invariant mass distributions was sufficiently good to imply that the cusp model is a parsimonious and accurate representation of the modelled physics .",
    "most of these predictions are unnatural in tetraquark or molecular models ( except point ( i ) for molecules ) .",
    "point ( ii ) is in direct conflict with molecular models unless unusual dynamics are postulated .",
    "the molecular candidate @xmath24 raises interesting questions in light of the cusp mechanism .",
    "the fact that its binding energy and width appear to be below 1 mev@xcite indicate that purely kinematical effects as advocated here are not wholly responsible for this signal",
    ". it will be interesting to study the interplay of kinematics and dynamics for this state .    finally , the relatively large rate for the reaction @xmath208 is somewhat mysterious since a heavy quark spin flip is required to make the transition from a @xmath209 to a @xmath210 bottomonium state .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the spin flip is being facilitated by the presence of light quark degrees of freedom in the intermediate state that persist over long time scales . in effect",
    ", the virtual @xmath104 permit the pions to carry off the spin component necessary to affect the @xmath172 spin flip .",
    "the evidence presented here makes it very likely that the @xmath4 and @xmath60 states are kinematical artefacts .",
    "the general lesson is that the interpretation of bumps is necessarily dependent on model assumptions .",
    "it is therefore important that experimental collaborations examine cusp effects when fitting data where channel thresholds are known to exist .",
