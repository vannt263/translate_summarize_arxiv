    "the data analysis of interferometric gws detectors has nowadays been started , and the scientific community hopes in a first direct detection of gws in next years ; for the current status of gws interferometers see ref . @xcite .",
    "in such a way , the indirect evidence of the existence of gws by hulse and taylor @xcite , nobel prize winners , will be confirmed .",
    "detectors for gws will be important for a better knowledge of the universe and also because the interferometric gws detection will be the definitive test for gtr or , alternatively , a strong endorsement for extended theories of gravity ( etg ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the discovery of gw emission by the compact binary system composed by two neutron stars psr1913 + 16 @xcite has been , for physicists working in this field , the ultimate thrust allowing to reach the extremely sophisticated technology needed for investigating in this field of research @xcite .",
    "gws are a consequence of einstein s gtr @xcite , which presuppose gws to be ripples in the space - time curvature travelling at light speed @xcite . in gtr",
    "only asymmetric astrophysics sources can emit gws @xcite .",
    "the most efficient are coalescing binaries systems at frequencies around 1 khz @xcite , while a single rotating pulsar can rely only on spherical asymmetries , usually very small @xcite .",
    "its spin frequency often lie in the hectohertz _  sweet spot _  of current detectors , i.e. at order hundreds hz @xcite .",
    "supernovae could have relevant asymmetries , being potential sources @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the frequency of gw emission from the birth of stellar mass collapsed objects is in the range 50hz to a few khz @xcite .",
    "the most important cosmological source of gws is , in principle , the so - called stochastic background of gws which , together with the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , would carry , if detected , a huge amount of information on the early stages of the universe evolution @xcite .",
    "the existence of a relic stochastic background of gws is a consequence of generals assumptions .",
    "essentially it derives from a mixing between basic principles of classical theories of gravity and of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the strong variations of the gravitational field in the early universe amplify the zero - point quantum oscillations and produce relic gws .",
    "it is well known that the detection of relic gws is the only way to learn about the evolution of the very early universe , up to the bounds of the planck epoch and the initial singularity @xcite .",
    "it is very important to stress the unavoidable and fundamental character of this mechanism .",
    "the model derives from the inflationary scenario for the early universe @xcite , which is consistent with the wmap data on the cbr ( in particular exponential inflation and spectral index @xmath0 1 @xcite ) .",
    "inflationary models are cosmological models in which the universe undergoes a brief phase of a very rapid expansion in early times @xcite . in this tapestry",
    "the expansion could be power - law or exponential in time .",
    "such models provide solutions to the horizon and flatness problems and contain a mechanism which creates perturbations in all fields @xcite .",
    "important for our case is that this mechanism also provides a distinctive spectrum of relic gws @xcite .",
    "the gws perturbations arise from the uncertainty principle and the spectrum of relic gws is generated from the adiabatically - amplified zero - point fluctuations @xcite . in standard cosmology",
    "such a spectrum is flat along the frequency range @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "regarding the potential gw detection , let us recall some historical notes . in 1957 , f. a. e. pirani , who was a member of the bondi s research group , proposed the geodesic deviation equation as a tool for designing a practical gw detector [ 14 ] . in 1959 , joseph weber [ 15 ] , studied a detector that , in principle , might be able to measure displacements smaller than the size of the nucleus .",
    "he developed an experiment using a large suspended bar of aluminium , with a high resonant q at a frequency of about 1 khz .",
    "then , in 1960 , he tried to test the general relativistic prediction of gws from strong gravity collisions [ 16 ] and , in 1969 , he claimed evidence for observation of gws ( based on coincident signals ) from two bars separated by 1000 km [ 17 ] .",
    "he also proposed the idea of doing an experiment to detect gws by using laser interferometers [ 17 ] .",
    "in fact , all the modern detectors can be considered like being originated from early weber s ideas @xcite . at the present time , in the world there are five cryogenic bar detectors which have been built to work at very low temperatures ( @xmath2 ) : explorer at cern , nautilus at frascati infn national laboratory , auriga at legnaro national laboratory , allegro at luisiana state university and niobe in perth @xcite .",
    "instrumental details can be found in @xcite and references within .",
    "spherical detectors are the mario schenberg , which has been built in san paolo ( brazil ) and the minigrail , which has been built at the kamerlingh onnes laboratory of leiden university , see @xcite and references within .",
    "spherical detectors are important for the potential detection of the scalar component of gws that is admitted in etg @xcite . in the case of interferometric detectors ,",
    "free falling masses are interferometer mirrors which can be separated by kilometres ( 3 km for virgo , 4 km for ligo ) @xcite . in this way , gw tidal force is , in principle , several order of magnitude larger than in bar detectors .",
    "interferometers have very large bandwidth ( @xmath3 ) because mirrors are suspended to pendulums having resonance in the hz region . thus , above such a resonance frequency , mirrors work , in a good approximation , like freely falling masses in the horizontal plane @xcite .",
    "now , let us recall the importance to distinguish the gravitational theories by using the observation of gws @xcite .",
    "motivations to extend gtr arise from the fact that even though einstein s theory @xcite has achieved great success ( see for example the opinion of landau , who said that gtr is , together with quantum field theory , the best scientific theory of all @xcite ) and passed a lot of experimental tests @xcite it has also showed some shortcomings and flaws which today prompt theorists to ask if it is the definitive theory of gravity @xcite . differently from other field theories like the electromagnetic theory ,",
    "gtr is very difficult to quantize @xcite .",
    "this fact rules out the possibility of treating gravitation like other quantum theories , and precludes the unification of gravity with other interactions . at the present time , it is not possible to realize a consistent quantum gravity theory which leads to the unification of gravitation with the other forces @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can define etg , those semi - classical theories where the lagrangian is modified , with respect to the standard einsteinhilbert gravitational lagrangian , adding high order terms to the curvature invariants ( terms like @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , in the sense of the so - called @xmath9 theories , see the recent review @xcite ) and/or terms with scalar fields non - minimally coupled to geometry ( terms like @xmath10 in the sense of the so - called scalar - tensor theories @xcite , i.e. generalizations of the jordan - fierz - brans - dicke theory of gravitation @xcite ) . in general , one has to emphasize that terms like those are present in all the approaches to performing the unification between gravity and other interactions .",
    "in addition , from a cosmological point of view , such modifications of gtr produce inflationary frameworks , which are very important as they solve a lot of problems of the standard universe model @xcite",
    ". note that we are not saying that gtr is wrong .",
    "it is well known that , even in the context of extended theories , gtr remains the most important part of the structure @xcite .",
    "we are only trying to understand if weak modifications on such a structure could be needed to solve some theoretical and observing problems .    in the general context of cosmological evidences",
    ", there are other considerations which suggest an extension of gtr . as a matter of fact",
    ", the accelerated expansion of the universe , which is today observed , shows that the cosmological dynamic is dominated by the so - called dark energy , which gives a large negative pressure .",
    "this is the standard picture , in which such a new ingredient is considered as a source of the right side of the field equations .",
    "it should be some form of unclustered non - zero vacuum energy which , together with the clustered dark matter , drives the global dynamics .",
    "this is the so - called _ concordance model _ ( @xmath11 ) , which gives , in agreement with the cmbr , lss and sneia data , a good tapestry of today s observed universe , but presents several shortcomings , such as the well - known _ coincidence _ and _ cosmological constant _",
    "problems @xcite . an alternative approach is to change the left side of the field equations , seeing if observed cosmic dynamics can be achieved by extending gtr @xcite . in this different context , we are not required to find candidates for dark energy and dark matter , which till now have not been found , but only the _ observed _ ingredients , which are curvature and baryon matter , have to be taken into account .",
    "considering this point of view , one can think that gravity is different at various scales and room for alternative theories is present @xcite . in principle , the most popular dark energy and dark matter models can be achieved considering @xmath9 theories of gravity @xcite , where @xmath12 is the ricci curvature scalar , and/or stg @xcite .",
    "also the tensor - vector - scalar theory ( tvst ) has attracted considerable attention as an alternative to gtr @xcite .",
    "tvst is proposed as a relativistic theory of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite , and it reproduces mond in the weak acceleration limit .",
    "let us recall the previous studies of how to distinguish alternative gravitational theories from gtr @xcite .",
    "for example , stg could be distinguished from gtr with surface atomic line redshift @xcite , with gws @xcite , while the tvst theory could be distinguished from gtr with surface atomic line redshift @xcite , with shapiro delays of gravitational waves and photon or neutrino @xcite , with gws @xcite , with the rotational effect @xcite .",
    "the recent result @xcite has shown that , if advanced projects on the detection of gws improve their sensitivity , allowing the scientific community to perform a gw astronomy , accurate angle- and frequency - dependent response functions of interferometers for gws arising from various theories of gravity will permit to discriminate among gtr and etg in an definitive way .",
    "this ultimate test will work because standard gtr admits only two polarizations for gws , while in all etg the polarizations are , at least , three , see @xcite for details .",
    "recently , starting from the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , some papers in the literature have shown the importance of the _ gravitomagnetic _ effects in the framework of the gws detection @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "in fact , the so - called _ magnetic _ components of gws have to be taken into account in the context of the total response functions of interferometers for gws propagating from arbitrary directions , @xcite , @xcite - @xcite . in a recent paper ,",
    "magnetic _ component has been extended to gws arising from stg too @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref . @xcite it has been shown that if one neglects the _",
    "magnetic _ contribution considering only the low - frequency approximation of the _ electric _ contribution , an important portion of the signal could be , in principle , lost in the case of stg too , in total analogy with the standard case of gtr @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "then , it is clear that the computation of a more precise response function for the _ magnetic _ contribution is important also in the framework of the possibility to distinguish other gravitational theories from gtr .    on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "an error was present in the fundamental equations ( 20 ) of such a paper @xcite .",
    "that error was dragged along all the computations in @xcite by enabling incorrect geometric factors in the angular dependence of the response function . in this paper the original error and the geometric factors in the angular dependence are corrected in order to obtain the correct response function for the _ magnetic _ component of gws in stg .    before starting the analysis ,",
    "let us explain the meaning of what is _ magnetic _ and what is _ electric _ among the components of gws @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , let us consider the analogy between the motion of free masses in the field of a gw and the motion of free charges in the field of an electromagnetic wave .",
    "a gw drives the masses in the plane of the wave - front and also , to a smaller extent , back and forth in the direction of the propagation of the wave . to describe this motion , the notion of _ electric _ and _ magnetic _ components of the gravitational force due to a gw can be introduced , as it has been discussed in @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the analogy is not perfect , but it shows some important features of the phenomenon @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite - @xcite the positions and motion of free test masses has been analysed in the local inertial reference frame associated with one of the masses , i.e. the beam - splitter in the case of an interferometer .",
    "it is well known that this choice of coordinate system is the closest thing to the global lorentzian coordinates that are normally used in electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the distinction among the _ electric _ and _ magnetic _ components of motion , as well as it is compared with electrodynamics , is particularly clear in this description @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "when one interacts with the detection of gws , the usually used equations , with the curvature tensor in them , are only the zero - order approximation in terms of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the length of the arms of the interferometer and @xmath15 the wave - length of the propagating gw @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "this approximation is sufficient for the description of the _ electric _ part of the motion , which concerns frequencies of order hundreds hz , but it results insufficient for the description of the _ magnetic _ part , which can concern frequencies of order khzs . in the next approximation , which is a first order in terms of @xmath13 , the geodesic deviation equation includes the derivatives of the curvature tensor , and",
    "this approximation is fully sufficient for the description of the _ magnetic _ force and _ magnetic _ component of motion .",
    "one understands that the component of motion which is called , with some reservations , _ magnetic _ represents the finite - wavelength correction to the usual infinite - wavelength approximation @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .    from the analyses in @xcite , @xcite - @xcite",
    ", it resulted that such a _",
    "magnetic _ component becomes particularly important in the high frequency portion of the frequency range of ground based interferometers and in future space based interferometers for gws which arises from standard gtr .",
    "the analysis has been extended to gws arising from stg too in @xcite . after a review of some important issues in section 2 , in this paper we re - analyse",
    "magnetic _ component in the framework of stg from a different point of view and we correct an original error in @xcite , which generated incorrect geometric factors in the angular dependence , in order to obtain the correct response function for the _ magnetic _ component of gws in stg . after this , we also compute a more precise response function which will show that if one neglects the _ magnetic _ contribution considering only the low - frequency approximation of the _ electric _ contribution , an important portion of the signal , which could arrive to about the @xmath16 for particular directions of the propagating gws , could be , in principle , lost .",
    "it is important to discuss the splitting between _",
    "magnetic _ and _ electric _ components from another point of view @xcite . in gtr ,",
    "gws are pure spin-2 tensor waves . in alternative theories",
    "there can be other spin contributions to the field , and the waves @xcite . in the particular case of this paper , which regards stg",
    ", there is an additional scalar sector to the gravitational field , responsible for a scalar sector to gravitational radiation .",
    "more specifically , one may mathematically break the gravitational field in gtr between _ electric - like _ and _ magnetic - like _ sectors , so called because of formal mathematical similarities to their name sakes in maxwell s theory @xcite .",
    "this division of the full gravitational field is most elegantly done in gtr using the weyl tensor @xcite . for a sake of completeness , this important point will be reviewed in next subsection 2.1 .    at the end of the paper an expansion of the main results",
    "is also shown in order to recall the presence of the magnetic component in grt too @xcite .",
    "in this subsection , where we closely follow @xcite , we show an irreducible splitting into _ electric _ and _ magnetic _ parts for the weyl tensor .    tidal forces in metric theories of gravity like grt and stg are described in a covariant way by the _ geodesic deviation equation _",
    "@xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the separation vector between two test masses @xcite , i.e. @xmath19 @xmath20 is the covariant derivative and @xmath21 the affine parameter along a geodesic @xcite . in this",

    "( [ eq : diff ] ) gives the relative acceleration of two neighbouring particles with the same 4-velocity @xmath25 .",
    "if one wants to find the electromagnetic analogue to ( [ eq : def geo ] ) , a very intrinsic difference between the two interactions has to be recalled . while the ratio between gravitational and inertial mass is universal , the same does not apply to the ratio between electrical charge and inertial mass . in other words",
    ", there is no electromagnetic counterpart of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "thus , the analogue electromagnetic problem will consist in considering two neighbouring particles with the same 4-velocity @xmath25 in an electromagnetic field on a flat minkowskian spacetime , by assuming the extra condition that the two particles have the same @xmath26 ratio @xcite . under these constrains ,",
    "one obtains the worldline deviation equation as @xcite    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the electromagnetic tensor @xcite . by comparing ( [ eq : def geo ] ) with ( [ eq : wordline ] ) one gets a physical analogy between the two tensors @xcite :    @xmath29    the tensor @xmath30 is the covariant derivative of the electric field , which is defined like @xmath31 and it is seen by an observer having a 4-velocity @xmath32 it is usually called the _ electric tidal tensor_. the gravitational counterpart @xmath33 is usually called the _ electric gravitational tidal tensor_. the different signs in ( [ eq : def geo ] ) and ( [ eq : wordline ] ) are due by the different interaction ( attractive or repulsive ) between masses or charges of the same sign @xcite . in",
