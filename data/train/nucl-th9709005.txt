    "<S> that means that measurements and theoretical studies for the nucleon strong interaction form factor in the time - like region and in the larger energy transfer region are very necessary indeed , since it plays a key role in obtaining the real part of the polarization insertions .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we neglect the natural width of the @xmath4-isobar propagator , but this will be remedied in future work . </S>",
    "<S> another related issue on the renormalization of the real part of the polarization insertion is the renormalization scheme . for nonrenormalizable pseudo - vector coupling , </S>",
    "<S> our scheme adopted in this paper is to use the dispersion relation with the introduction of a form factor with a cut - off parameter @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative scheme is to introduce a cut - off momentum in momentum space @xmath43 [ 18 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized polarization insertion thus obtained depends on @xmath43 also , so it will be very interesting to compare two schemes and study the difference . </S>",
