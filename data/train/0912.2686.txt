    "the origin of magnetic fields in the universe has been an active field of modern cosmology and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "concerning the origin of galactic magnetic fields , which are observationally known to be of order @xmath3 , it is argued that dynamo mechanism could amplify and maintain magnetic fields if there were some tiny fields ( @xmath4 ) at the galaxy formation ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "there have been many approaches to the origin of the seed fields such as cosmological scenarios @xcite and generation via reionization @xcite .",
    "these scenarios predict that the universe is filled with very tiny magnetic fields about @xmath5 and there is a possibility that they could be observationally probed through the detection of delayed high - energy emission from gamma - ray bursts @xcite .    in this article , we focus on magnetogenesis in primordial supernova remnant ( snr ) via the biermann mechanism @xcite .",
    "the biermann mechanism was also studied in other systems such as the formation of protogalaxies @xcite and pop iii stars @xcite .",
    "the biermann mechanism is an induction process of magnetic fields and can be derived by combining a generalised ohm s law with the maxwell equation @xcite , @xmath6 neglecting the electric resistivity .",
    "here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the velocity of protons , the mass of electrons , the elementary electric charge , the light velocity , the pressure of electrons , and the mass density of electrons , respectively .",
    "when we assume @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represent the number density of electrons , protons , and ions , the total gas pressure , and the fluid velocity , respectively , equation ( [ indeqe ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath21 the coefficient @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass of protons .",
    "the biermann mechanism requires a vorticity of plasma gas .",
    "the vorticity is generated in the region where the spatial gradients of the pressure and density are not parallel .",
    "there are some studies of the interaction of the shock of snr and interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed that the interaction produces the vorticity efficiently in the shocked region .",
    "the interaction of inhomogeneous interstellar medium and the shock of snr also drives the turbulent motion of the gas , and the vorticity is generated in the bubble of snr @xcite .",
    "therefore , primordial snrs occurred before the galaxy formation can be a candidate of the origin of galactic magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that primordial supernova explosions play an important role in the magnetogenesis , since the initial mass function ( imf ) of population iii stars is believed to be substantially top - heavy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the generation of the seed fields by the primordial supernova explosions",
    ", @xcite studied the process with multiple explosion scenario of population iii objects .",
    "although their situation considered is more or less similar to ours , their calculations are based on several ad hoc assumptions .",
    "first , they calculate magnetic field strength assuming a constant generation rate which is actually dependent on the configuration of the density and pressure gradients .",
    "second , they considered multiple sn explosions , and most of the magnetic fields is produced by the hypothetical objects with a mass @xmath25 , and explosion energy @xmath26 .",
    "this assumption seems inconsistent with the current understanding of star formation .    in our previous article @xcite , we studied the generation of magnetic fields by the biermann mechanism with realistic two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulations .",
    "a single snr with the explosion energy @xmath27 was put in inhomogeneous ism and the generation and evolution of magnetic fields were followed .",
    "then we found the total energy of the magnetic fields to be @xmath28 depending on the supernova and ism parameters .    in this article",
    ", we present more detailed analysis especially focusing on the temperature relaxation between ions and electrons . when we derived equation ( [ indeq ] ) from equation ( [ indeqe ] ) , we used @xmath29 which comes from the assumption that the ions and electrons have the same temperature , @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the temperatures of ions @xmath31 and electrons @xmath32 just behind the shock differ each other and the rankine - hugoniot shock jump condition indicates @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the shock velocity . noting that the time scale of the coulomb interactions between electrons and ions @xcite is longer than the age of snr in the early phase , there is a possibility that the electron temperature behind the snr shock front is much lower than the ion temperature . in this case",
    ", the analysis with equation ( [ indeq ] ) would overestimate the generation of magnetic fields .    for a long time",
    ", the temperature relaxation of ions and electrons behind the shock of snr has been actively discussed by many authors @xcite . according to @xcite , in the unequilibrated region in the early phase of snr the electron temperature is spatially isothermal .",
    "if this is the case , the gradient of electron pressure is negligible and , therefore , the biermann mechanism is there ineffective .",
    "thus , we have to follow the electron temperature in order to analyze the generation of magnetic fields correctly .",
    "this is the main ingredient of the current article .    on the other hand , in the radiative cooling phase , although the electron temperature is expected to be sufficiently equilibrated to the ion temperature , the radiative cooling process increases its importance with the decrease of the temperature at the shock front , and the thermal structure of the snr becomes isothermal again @xcite .",
    "then , the biermann mechanism does not work effectively in the snr .",
    "therefore , in this study , we focus on the generation of the magnetic fields before the radiative cooling phase .    in section [ sec : model ] , the basic equations for numerical simulation of primordial snrs , the numerical method , and the initial condition of snr and its surrounding environment are given . in section [ sec :",
    "result ] , we present the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we discuss the analytic estimations of the generated magnetic fields in section [ sec : discuss ] .",

    "the last term of the right - hand side of equation ( [ ind2 ] ) is called biermann term and expresses the biermann effect , where @xmath47 .",
    "we assumed the gas is fully ionized and the number ratio of h to he to be @xmath48 .",
    "then the mean molecular weights are @xmath49 for nuclei and @xmath50 for fully - ionized ions and electrons .",
    "the number density of the hydrogen atoms is @xmath51 where @xmath18 means the number density of the ions ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "since we focus on the generation of the magnetic fields in adiabatic expansion phase , we ignore the radiative cooling .",
    "we pay attention to the region where the magnetic fields is generated by the biermann mechanism .",
    "the interaction between the shock wave and the inhomogeneous ism generates the vorticity . therefore , especially , in the transition layer of the shock front , the baroclinic term @xmath53 is expected to work effectively because the gradient of the pressure is much larger than in other regions . however , the thickness of the layer is much smaller compared with the radius of snr , and is on the order of , or larger than the ion inertia length of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "in such a region , although the behaviour of the plasma particle must be considered , it depends on complex processes of the interaction of ions and electrons , and is conventionally studied by particle simulations @xcite .",
    "if the electron pressure @xmath11 is not as high as the proton pressure @xmath55 there , the biermann mechanism may not work effectively .",
    "in fact , @xcite predicted the ratio between the electron and the ion temperatures @xmath56 in the transition layer with alfv@xmath57nic mach number of @xmath58 .",
    "observationally , the ratio @xmath59 is less than @xmath60 in the transition layer with a shock velocity larger than @xmath61 @xcite . since in the transition layer the electron temperature is expected to be lower than the ion temperature , we ignore the generation process working in the transition layer as long as we consider the early phase of snr .",
    "that is , we only take the biermann effect in the interior of snr into account , even if it would lead to an underestimate of magnetic fields .",
    "thus , our analysis is rather conservative .    in our calculation",
    "we introduce a switch @xmath62 that discriminates the region of the post shock region where we calculate the biermann term @xmath63 in our one - temperature / one - pressure description . for the search of the boundary between the transition layer and the post shock region ,",
    "the switch @xmath62 is defined as follows : @xmath64 in the region of @xmath65 ; @xmath66 in the region of @xmath67 ; @xmath68 in the region of @xmath69 .",
    "if the switch @xmath62 is equal to @xmath70 or @xmath71 , then we reduce the biermann term to zero . in this way",
    ", we discuss the generation process of the magnetic fields in the inner region of snr .",
    "furthermore , since a region with @xmath72 has isothermal @xmath32 distribution , magnetic generation is ignorable there .",
    "therefore , we restrict the generation region of the magnetic fields to the postshock region with @xmath73 .",
    "thus , our calculation must give a same result obtained with two - temperature simulation effectively .",
    "then , the induction equation ( [ ind2 ] ) with the relaxation effect of the electron temperature is written as @xmath74      we also consider the relaxation of the electron temperature . in the adiabatic expansion phase of snr , the relaxation equation of electron temperature is derived from the energy equation for the electron gas with the heating effect driven by the coulomb collision with ions .",
    "here , we ignore the thermal conduction and the radiative cooling .",
    "the relaxation equation was given by @xcite , and we convert the formulation according to @xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath77 is a function of @xmath78 defined as @xmath79 after solving equation ( [ relax32 ] ) for @xmath77 , @xmath78 can be obtained from an approximate formula @xmath80 .",

    "we solve the above equations by a two - dimensional mhd code in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath85 assuming axial symmetry around the symmetry axis ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "since we start the calculation from @xmath87 , it is sufficient to consider only the @xmath88-component of the magnetic fields @xmath89 which is generated from the biermann term .",
    "the code is based on the mhd roe scheme @xcite coupled with muscl technique @xcite to achieve the second order spatial and temporal accuracy .",
    "we employ improved rotated - hybrid riemann solvers @xcite to overcome so - called carbuncle phenomenon , which is a numerical instability appeared in the shock wave .",
    "curing @xmath90 error , we adopted the hyperbolic divergence cleaning given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that equation ( [ relax32 ] ) is also solved by using the fully upwind scheme with muscl and carbuncle cure technique which achieve the second order spatial - temporal accuracy and numerical stability .",
    "the numerical scheme was tested by several problems .",
    "we checked the code by comparing with mhd shock tube problems @xcite and the adiabatic snr with the analytic sedov solution @xcite . in high resolution calculation ( @xmath91 grids ) of primordial snr expanding into a uniform ism ( explosion energy @xmath92 and ism density @xmath93 are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively ) , the postshock density peak value of the shock front at @xmath96 after the sn explosion was @xmath97 of the analytical value ( four times larger than the density of ism ) , for example .",
    "in addition , we compared our results with those of @xcite for the case of interaction of a plane - parallel shock with a cloud to check the robustness of our calculation of the vorticity derived from the induction equation ( [ ind2 ] ) .",
    "as for the normalized peak value of total circulation @xmath98 in the evolution of the cloud distracted by the planar shock , it is analytically estimated as @xmath99 @xcite for the model of as8 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the result of @xcite is @xmath100 while that of our calculation is @xmath101 , and both results are in good agreement with klein s estimation within 10% .    in computation ,",
    "our numerical domain covers a region of @xmath102 with @xmath103 grid points .",
    "the grid spacings are @xmath104 and the length scale of density fluctuation ( @xmath105 , see below ) is resolved with 128 grids .",
    "this is sufficient for the convergence of the total magnetic energy as we show later . in the simulated region of @xmath102 ,",
    "the average density of ism is approximately constant even in the dark halo structure @xcite .",
    "we assume inhomogeneous ism with average number density of @xmath106 for initial conditions of our fiducial model , and also consider a model with @xmath107 as a variation .",
    "these assumptions are consistent with the previous studies @xcite , in which they obtained initial conditions for population iii sn sites that were calculated by self - consistent radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the scale length of the density fluctuation and the amplitude of the inhomogeneity are not well understood .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the formation process of hii region around a very massive first star with 3d numerical simulations , and showed the anisotropic expansion and inhomogeneous density structure in the hii region with the scale of @xmath108 . in their study",
    ", the hii region has relatively large density inhomogeneities and the spatial scale of the large inhomogeneity seems to be of the order @xmath109 .",

    "as for the sfr of pop iii stars , extrapolating the one by @xcite and @xcite , we have @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the fraction of the pop iii stars in sfr , and we adopt @xmath245 that was derived under the assumption that very massive black holes produced from first stars end up in supermassive black holes in galactic centers @xcite .",
    "if we assume the formation period of the first stars continued from @xmath246 to @xmath247 ( @xmath248 ) , the total number density of the pop iii sne can be estimated as @xmath249 where the number density is in units of physical scale , not comoving .",
    "primordial star formation rate was also estimated by @xcite . even taking pop iii and pop ii.5 of their classification into account",
    ", we confirmed that our results below do not change so much .    taking the typical value of the magnetic energy of a pop iii snr as that of model a , @xmath250 , the spatially - averaged magnetic energy density is estimated as , @xmath251 .",
    "if we assume that galaxies are formed in such a magnetized medium , the magnetic energy density in protogalaxies is given by @xmath252 where @xmath253 represents the overdensity of protogalaxies .",
    "this means that the average magnitude of the magnetic fields becomes @xmath254 , which would be enough for the required seed field of galactic dynamo @xcite .",
    "although the coherence length of the order of @xmath255 estimated here is much smaller than the galactic scale , it would be amplified by the galactic dynamo @xcite .",
    "it may also be amplified by interstellar turbulence dynamo to produce fluctuating components @xcite .",
    "finally let us comment on the three - dimensional effects . in this study , we performed two - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "however , because of the assumption of the axisymmetry , the generated magnetic fields are restricted to the toroidal component .",
    "this makes it rather hard to argue the coherence length of magnetic fields .",
    "further , the spectrum of magnetic fields would be different in three - dimensional simulations , because the vorticity cascade is different in 2d and 3d turbulences .",
    "we will present three - dimensional simulations in a separate paper but we believe that most of the features of the biermann mechanism in snr are captured in the present study .",
    "in this article , we argued the biermann mechanism in primordial supernova remnants through two - dimensional mhd simulations with the biermann term .",
    "we solved simultaneously the relaxation of the electron temperature , which is crucial to the efficiency of the biermann mechanism and was not taken into account in our previous study @xcite .",
    "it was found that magnetic fields begin to be generated from @xmath256 just behind the shock front .",
    "the total magnetic energy reaches about @xmath1 and does not depend strongly on the parameters of snr and ism .",
    "we could understood analytically the dependence of the magnetic total energy on the parameters and also the time evolution .",
    "finally we evaluated the expected amplitude of magnetic fields in protogalaxies , which would be sufficient for seed fields of the observed galactic magnetic fields .",
