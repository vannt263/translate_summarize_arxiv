    "an interesting and sensitive test for models of baryon structure will soon be performed at the recently completed jefferson lab facility when the radiative decay widths of the first two excited states of the @xmath4 hyperon , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , will be determined directly in a quadrupole coincidence measurement experiment @xcite .",
    "there are four such widths to be measured , two for each excited hyperon radiatively decaying into ground states @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and so far none of the predictions of various models of baryons inspired by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) agree with each other @xcite .",
    "calculation of these widths is extremely model dependent involving the wave functions of excited hyperons as well as transition operators both of which must be determined in a self consistent manner .",
    "it is therefore a challenge for _ any _ model of baryon structure to predict correctly all four widths .",
    "discrepancies among existing model predictions are large enough to be able to distiguish experimentally among various results .",
    "but unfortunately , presently available experimental data on the four radiative decay widths either disagree by an order of magnitude @xcite or have been extracted in a model dependent manner @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically this test is particularly welcome since almost all the models of baryon structure can describe the static properties of the ground state octet and decuplet baryons rather well , and therefore it is very difficult to judge the success of any given model based on its description of the ground states alone .",
    "in addition , it is often the case that a given model which can reproduce the properties of ground state baryons will run into difficulties when extended to describe the excited states .",
    "an example of this difficulty is the removal of the center  of  mass motion in relativistic quark models where no rigorous method to project out the spurious degrees of freedom exist .",
    "thus a successful description of ground state baryons in any model is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the model to be realistic , and the upcoming direct precision measurements of the excited hyperon radiative decay widths at jefferson lab present an excellent testing ground for any model of baryons under development .",
    "one such model is the chiral confining model ( ccm ) of baryons @xcite where a baryon is described as a color singlet composite object consisting of interacting valence quarks , mesons and a color and chiral singlet hybrid field @xmath9 .",
    "the model produces absolute quark confinment using a mechanism introduced by nielsen and ptkos @xcite to dynamically generate a confining region , or a `` bag '' , inside which the above constituents coexist to form a baryon .",
    "although the model has not been directly derived from qcd , it is at least consistent with the essential properties of the underlying theory of strong interactions such as chiral invariance and the behaviour in the limit of large number of colors , @xmath10 .",
    "the initial version of the ccm@xcite revealed two major problems .",
    "the model prediction for the product of the nucleon mass and the quark rms radius was too large , while that for @xmath11 mass splitting was too small .",
    "mcgovern , _ et al _ @xcite showed there was an approximate scaling law for the ccm which stated that if either the mass or the size of the nucleon was kept fixed at some particular value all other predictions of the ccm were also more or less fixed .",
    "the problems were resolved @xcite by extending the model to include the t  hooft interaction @xcite . by fitting the @xmath12 mass difference to determine the strength of the effective t  hooft interaction and using simple estimates to correct for the center  of  mass motion ,",
    "the prediction for the product of the nucleon mass and the quark rms radius were reduced to an acceptable value in the range of 3.8 to 4.4 , the empirical value being about 3.5 .    in this two ",
    "part series the ccm is extended to the strangeness sector and is used to examine the properties of low  lying negative parity @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 baryons in the mean field approximation .",
    "excited baryons are regarded as rpa excitations of the ground state baryons and includes both particle  hole excitations of the valence quarks as well as creation of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the first paper considers excited baryons built with valence quarks in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 states and examines the contribution of such states to the masses , wave functions and hadronic form factors using a spin  isospin dependent instanton induced interaction @xcite .",
    "baryons obtained with only the valence quarks are refered to as  bare  baryons .",
    "mesonic corrections to properties of bare excited baryon will be presented in a followinging paper .",
    "the role of gluons in the ccm appears in three distinct ways :    * first , the gluon condensate of the vacuum manifests itself through the appearance of the color dielectric function  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation of the gluon condensate appears in the form a @xmath16 hybrid field  @xcite .",
    "* second , the instanton , a feature of _ classical _ euclidean qcd , appears through the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being the number of flavors ) fermion interaction introduced by t  hooft  @xcite to represent approximately the role of instantons on the quark contribution to the partition function . in the absence of this idea",
    "it would not be possible to include the role of instantons in a mean field theory in the minkowski world .",
    "* third , the role of the exchange of _ quantum _ gluons is described through meson exchanges@xcite .",
    "note that perturbative one  gluon exchange ( oge ) interaction can not be included in this model as that would lead to double counting . since oge interaction is widely used in quark models by many authors , the differences between three ",
    "quark wave functions obtained with the instanton induced and oge interactions are examined .    in order to diagonalize the bare baryon hamiltonian , @xmath19 , it is necessary to remove the spurious components in the excited baryon wave functions corresponding to the translation of the center  of  mass of the composite baryon . for the ccm , where a baryon is a composite object consisting of relativistic quarks , mesons and the @xmath9 field , seeking an exact solution to this problem is an impractical task .",
    "thus in this work a prescription originally used in the study of excited baryons in the mit bag model by degrand @xcite is used to approximately eliminate the unphysical states .",
    "the method is able to predict the observed number of low  lying negative parity @xmath0 and @xmath1 states but is strictly valid only in the non  relativistic and su(6 ) spin  flavor limits .",
    "a simple test of this prescription is presented in the appendix  b in order to estimate the relative amount of spurious component present in the excited hyperon wave function for different strange quark masses . after eliminating the spurious states",
    "@xmath19 is diagonalized by assuming equal masses for up , down and strange quarks to be consistent with the center  of  mass removal prescription .",
    "corrections from flavor symmetry breaking to the hyperon masses are given to first order by modifying the single particle energies of strange quarks after diagonalization .",
    "the three ",
    "quark wave functions for excited baryons are used to calculate meson  bare excited baryon vertex functions to lowest order in meson - quark coupling .",
    "when the baryons are on mass  shell each of these vertex functions is a product of a coupling constant and a form factor .",
    "bare baryon form factors are extracted from the vertex functions and used to determine the quark contribution to the axial coupling constants of negative parity nucleons .",
    "it is pointed out that these hadronic form factors do not have the correct analytical behaviour in the complex @xmath20plane . in the second paper",
    "these vertex functions are used to determine meson cloud contribution to physical baryon properties in the heavy baryon and one  loop approximations .",
    "essential features of the ccm are presented in the following section together with single particle energies and spinors of confined quarks in the ground and relevant excited states .",
    "the model hamiltonian for bare baryons is then defined by using the t  hooft interaction as the residual interaction between quarks . in section",
    "iii , this hamiltonian is diagonalized and bare masses and wave functions of negative parity baryons @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are presented and compared to other model calculations .",
    "these three  quark wave functions are used in section  iv to calculate meson  bare excited baryon vertex functions .",
    "corresponding form factors for negative parity @xmath0 resonances and their axial coupling constants are also presented as examples and problems with the results discussed .",
    "finally , the paper is summarized in section v.",
    "the ccm  @xcite is based on the color dielectric theory proposed by nielsen and ptkos  @xcite .",
    "these authors introduced two collective variables , @xmath21 , a color singlet , charge ",
    "conjugation even object , and @xmath22 , a coarse  grained gluon field expressed in terms of averages of link operators for loops contained in a hypercube of side @xmath23 . upon integrating out the qcd gluon fields in favor of these new collective variables nielsen and ptkos obtained the following lagrangian in the form of a derivative expansion , @xmath24 \\psi(x ) -\\frac{k(x)^4}{4}g^a_{\\mu\\nu}g^{a\\,\\mu\\nu}+\\ldots .",
    "\\label{npl1}\\ ] ] in terms of the gauge field , @xmath25 , the coarse grained field tensor is @xmath26 from the gluonic term one identifies @xmath27 as the color dielectric function .",
    "nielsen and ptkos conjectured that @xmath28 the ccm adds four new features to the nielsen and ptkos model .",
    "first , the conjecture shown in eq .",
    "( [ kvac1 ] ) , crucial for the ccm , was justified from the lattice gauge point of view by lee _",
    "et al . _",
    "it is customary to introduce the field @xmath29 as @xmath30 whereupon @xmath31 has the dimensions of @xmath23 .",
    "the second feature in ccm is the demonstration , through large @xmath10 analysis  @xcite , that @xmath29 is a hybrid and not a glueball field .",
    "this is crucial for proper large @xmath10 behavior of ccm itself .",
    "the third feature in ccm is the conjecture that there exists a suitable gauge in which the coarse  grained gluon field @xmath22 may be integrated out in favor of meson fields .",
    "the meson fields were described with the gell ",
    "mann levy linear @xmath32model  @xcite .",
    "this allowed the introduction , through @xmath33 mev , of an ever  present mass like term for the quarks in a perfectly chiral invariant manner .",
    "thus field variables in the ccm are quarks , mesons and the hybrid field @xmath9 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath21 in the vacuum means that @xmath34 the meson ",
    "quark coupling may involve a factor @xmath35 .",
    "the fourth feature of ccm is the fixing of the exponent @xmath36 .",
    "this was found by comparing the @xmath37dependence of the four  fermion interaction obtained by integrating out the @xmath38 fields of the nielsen and ptkos lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ npl1 ] ) , with that obtained by integrating out the mesons in the ccm lagrangian .",
    "it was found that @xmath39 .",
    "finally , canonical quark fields were introduced using the transformation @xmath40 . in terms of the canonical quark fields the effective ccm lagrangian , extended to su(3 )",

    "mann matrices @xmath47 are normalized to @xmath48 .",
    "the inclusion of vector mesons requires that ccm lagrangian use the lee and nieh s form for @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "two simple forms for the @xmath9 potential , pure mass and quartic , have been considered .",
    "this paper will use only the pure mass form given by @xmath50 extensive su(2 ) calculations have shown that the meson fields produced by the valence quarks themselves play relatively less important role in the baryon structure .",
    "hence a reasonable approximation is to set the mesons fields at their vacuum values .",
    "thus @xmath51 and all other meson fields are fixed at the value zero .",
    "in addition , the parameter @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ccm ] ) is set to @xmath53 .",
    "the resulting model is called the toy model .",
    "it must be understood that it is used solely to obtain reasonable approximations to the valence spinors and the @xmath9 field .",
    "for example , in order to calculate meson",
    " baryon coupling constants the full ccm lagrangian must be used to obtain the meson source currents .",
    "the toy model lagrangian is @xmath54 the bag formation mechanism depends on two critical ingredients specified by eqs .",
    "( [ chivac ] ) , @xmath55 , and ( [ sigvac ] ) , @xmath56 and incorporated in the toy model .",
    "the euler lagrange equation for the quark field from the toy model is @xmath57 thus a quark can not exist in the region where @xmath58 .",
    "however because of the coupling between quarks and the @xmath9 field , valence quarks change the value of the @xmath9 field away from its vacuum value and make it nonzero .",
    "this region is the dynamically created bag where a quark can exist .",
    "there are four adjustable parameters in @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath31 and @xmath53 .",

    "shuryak and rosner @xcite also used a similar constituent quark model to parametrize the ground state baryon mass spectrum using only the two  body effective instanton induced force .",
