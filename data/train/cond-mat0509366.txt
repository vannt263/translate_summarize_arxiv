    "a sophisticated ( and still improving ) theory has been developed for computing the thermodynamic properties of such systems in great generality ( cf .",
    "for instance @xcite and references therein ) . among the recurring predictions of this theory is the occurrence ( in models with frustration or self - induced frustration ) of a _ dynamical phase transition _ ( dpt ) @xcite .",
    "while the system free energy remains analytic at the dpt , this is revealed by more refined thermodynamic potentials @xcite ( such as the configurational entropy ) which indicate the appearence of a broken - ergodicity phase .    despite its eminently dynamical character",
    ", the dynamics itself at the dpt is poorly understood .",
    "for fully - connected ( fc ) mean field models , in which each degree of freedom ( spin , particle , etc ) interacts with all the others , one can usually solve the dynamics in terms of a closed set of equations for the two points correlation and response functions .",
    "this is no longer true for models on bethe lattices , which have finite connectivity ( each degree of freedom interacts with a finite number of neighbors ) . correlation and response functions involving an arbitrary number of times are relevant in this case  @xcite .",
    "this is somehow healthy : there is no hope to obtain a finite set of closed equations describing the dynamics of realistic ( finite - dimensional ) systems .",
    "alternative approaches developed for bethe lattice models may , on the other hand , prove more general .",
    "consider the relaxation of a particular degree of freedom , for instance a spin .",
    "as the dpt is approached , dynamics slows down because , in order for the spin to decorrelate , a larger and larger number of degrees of freedom have to be rearranged coherently .",
    "our approach consists in computing some detailed properties ( e.g. their minimal size or the minimal energy barrier to be overcome in order to realize them ) of such rearrangements and then using these properties to estimate relaxation times .",
    "while we shall develop these ideas on a specific bethe - lattice model , they are susceptible of generalization to a variety of other examples",
    ". the cases of @xmath0-core percolation and kinetically constrained models @xcite are , for instance , quite straightforward , and will be treated in a related publication  @xcite ( the model treated in the present paper is in fact strictly related to @xmath1-core percolation on random hypergraphs ) .    due to the lack of a simple order parameter and the extensive configurational entropy , the broken ergodicity phase is often referred to as a  glassy \" phase . in the 80 s , kirkpatrick , wolynes and thirumalai  @xcite stressed the analogy between the dpt ( in the context of fully - connected models ) and the mode coupling transition @xcite , thus motivating a considerable effort aimed at a theoretical understanding of structural glasses .",
    "one recent advance has been the definition a  dynamical length scale \" associated to the dynamical slowing down  @xcite . within mean - field models and",
    "mode coupling theory ( mct ) this length scale diverges at the dpt  @xcite .",
    "however , the relation between this phenomenon and the diverging relaxation time is poorly understood . also , the basic physical mechanism underlying this divergence in glasses is presumably different from the one occurring in simpler system , and is still misterious  @xcite",
    ". finally , it would be useful to establish a quantitative relation between the dynamical slowing down and some purely static observable .    in order to clarify these points ,",
    "let us contrast our understanding of the dpt with the one we have of the paramagnetic  to  ferromagnetic transition in the ising model .",
    "in this case a typical configuration close to the transition looks like a patchwork of positively and negatively magnetized regions .",
    "the typical linear size of each region is the correlation length @xmath2 , and total magnetization is @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the susceptibility ) . assuming that the magnetization performs a random walk",
    ", we can estimate the relaxation time as @xmath5 .",
    "since standard scaling theory predicts @xmath6 , we get @xmath7 .",
    "in fact the dynamical scaling hypothesis states that @xmath8 with exponent @xmath9  @xcite .    a further source of motivation is to understand the role of activation at the dpt .",
    "much of our understanding of this phase transition comes from the study of a particular model : the @xmath10-spin spherical spin glass  @xcite .",
    "mct has been shown to be exact for this model  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the energy landscape and its relation to dynamics are relatively simple  @xcite . above the transition temperature ,",
    "the system never visits minima and moves among saddles . as temperature",
    "is lowered the number of energy - decreasing directions decreases , slowing down the dynamics  @xcite . below the critical point ,",
    "the system is typically found near a local minimum and is separated by diverging ( in the thermodynamic limit ) energy barriers from other minima .",
    "activation is therefore irrelevant both above and below the dpt .",
    "it is not necessary in the first case , and it can not take place within physical time - scales in the second .",
    "this has lead to question whether activated processes could spoil the predictions of mct for more realistic ( finite - dimensional ) models . in this case a standard nucleation argument suggests that ergodicity is restored within a finite ( in the thermodynamic limit ) time  @xcite .    like other mean - field systems , models on bethe lattices",
    "are characterized by diverging energy barriers within the broken ergodicity phase .",
    "therefore , they can not help understanding the role of activation in this regime . on the other hand ,",
    "finite energy barriers are present in the ergodic phase and one may ask whether they modify the mct critical behavior upon approaching the dpt . notice that such a question is in general",
    "not well - defined because the distinction between activated and non - activated processes becomes sharp only in the zero - temperature limit . in the following",
    "we shall study in detail a zero - temperature multi - critical point where the distinction makes sense .",
    "the model and some basic notations are introduced in section [ definitionsection ] .",
    "the phase diagram is described in terms of two basic parameters : the temperature @xmath11 , and @xmath12 which quantify the degree of constrainedness of the system .",
    "we then discuss the critical properties of the dpt in sections [ originsection ] and [ rearrsection ] .",
    "let @xmath13 be the phase transition temperature",
    ". we will show that @xmath14-points susceptibilities stay finite at @xmath13 for any given @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , we introduce a correlation length @xmath15 using point - to - set correlations and show that @xmath16 .",
    "this correlation length is connected to relaxation times using a disagreement percolation argument which implies a bound of the form @xmath17 .",
    "we then consider the @xmath18 , finite @xmath12 limit ( still within the ergodic phase ) . in this regime ,",
    "the dynamics is dominated by activated processes and the relaxation time can be derived from a standard arrhenius argument .",
    "the relevant large scale rearrangements minimize the energy barrier to be overcome in order to realize them , cf .",

    "the barriers height diverges as @xmath12 increases and approach the dpt point @xmath19 ( at which @xmath20 ) . in sec .",

    "we also consider minimal size rearrangements ( cf .",
    "[ sec_minsize ] ) , which share several properties with minimal barrier ones , and are somewhat easier to analyze .",
    "we compare the critical behavior as @xmath21 with standard mct predictions .",
    "we find that several of these predictions are violated .",
    "more surprisingly some universal properties of mct ( such as the divergence of the four point susceptibility ) hold even in this extremely activated regime .",
    "the point @xmath22 is a tricritical point , analogous to the percolation point in diluted ferromagnets . in sec .",
    "[ scalingsection ] , we use standard scaling theory in order to connect the @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 regimes . the scaling hypothesis is verified through numerical simulations . under this hypothesis",
    ", temperature is a relevant variable and a crossover from an activation - dominated to a thermal regime takes place .",
    "we argue that the thermal regime is controlled by usual mct critical behavior at any finite temperature .",

    ", the number of interactions a given spin belongs to ( its degree ) is a poisson random variable with parameter @xmath39 .",

    "start from @xmath61 , add to it any hyperedge of @xmath30 having at most one vertex not yet in @xmath60 , and repeat until such an hyperedge exist . in view of these remarks , it is not surprising that several results of this paper can be generalized to kinetically constrained models ( in this case the relevant geometrical transition is the @xmath0-core percolation @xcite ) .",
    "no exact result exists for the dynamics at any finite value of @xmath12 .",
    "standard generating function methods allow to formally derive a hierarchy of dynamical equations for multi - time correlation and response functions  @xcite .",
    "several approximation schemes have been proposed  @xcite for this hierarchy .",
    "such approximations have been developed mostly within models with a continuous transition ( typically , the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , their generalization to models undergoing a discontinuous transition is straightforward .",
    "unfortunately such approximations break down in the critical regime @xmath63 .    in the following",
    "we shall use repeatedly two useful properties of this model .",
    "first : as long as there exist at least one zero - energy ground - state , all such ground - states are equivalent .",
    "suppose that @xmath64 is such a ground state , and that @xmath65 is an equilibrium configuration for the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) at temperature @xmath11 .",
    "define @xmath66 ( this is often called a  gauge \" transformation ) . then @xmath67 is distributed according to the boltzmann measure with an hamiltonian of the form ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , with the same graph @xmath30 and temperature @xmath11 as the original model , but with @xmath68 for all the interactions ( ferromagnetic model ) .",
    "therefore any property of @xmath64 which is invariant under this change of variable can be computed for the @xmath69 ground state of the ferromagnetic model . in particular , for @xmath70 this implies that the ground states of the @xmath71 model as observed from @xmath64 ,  look like \" the ground states of the ferromagnetic model as observed from @xmath72 .",
    "the second property will be used uniquely in numerical simulations and can be stated in two parts : @xmath73 as long as @xmath30 does not contain hyperloops ( i.e. subgraphs such that each site has even degree ) the partition function of the model is _ exactly _ given by the annealed computation , i.e. @xmath74 . @xmath75 under the same hypothesis , sampling the sign of the couplings @xmath76 ( for a given graph @xmath30 ) and then the configuration @xmath65 according to the boltzmann distribution is equivalent to sampling @xmath65 from the uniform distribution and then the couplings as independent random variables with distribution @xmath77 the proof of this statement is deferred to appendix  [ app : proofprop ] .",
    "it is a consequence of the results of refs .",
    "@xcite that , for @xmath50 a random graph @xmath30 constructed as above does not contain any hyperloop with high probability .",
    "sampling first @xmath65 and then @xmath78 is much simpler than the opposite .",
    "we shall adopt this procedure in order to generate thermalized configurations for simulating the equilibrium dynamics .",
    "it is an open ( and interesting ) problem whether the same procedure can be useful in the region @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( at least for large enough systems ) .",
    "in this paper we shall denote by @xmath81 expectation with respect to the boltzmann measure at inverse temperature @xmath82 , and by @xmath83 expectation with respect to the quenched disorder ( i.e. the graph @xmath30 and the couplings @xmath84 ) .",
    "connected correlation functions ( see , for instance , @xcite for a definition ) are denoted by @xmath85 .",

    "two variables are said to be  adjacent \" if their distance is equal to one , and connected if there is a path joining them .",
    "a set of variables is connected if its elements are pairwise connected .",
    "an important property of random graphs , on which we shall come back later , is that , in the @xmath38 limit , any finite neighborhood of a generic site is , with high probability , a tree .    finally , for asymptotic behaviors ( here as @xmath98 ) we write : @xmath99 if @xmath100 is bounded away from @xmath52 and @xmath101 for @xmath14 large enough ; @xmath102 if @xmath103 . further @xmath104 if @xmath105 is numerically close to @xmath106 .",
