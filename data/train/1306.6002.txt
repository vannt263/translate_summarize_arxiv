    "the existence of _ symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures _ ( sic povms , or simply sics ) in arbitrary dimensions and the existence of complete systems of @xmath0 mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) in complex hilbert spaces of dimensions @xmath1 other than prime power have remained unsolved despite much effort expended on them over the last ten years or so .",

    "our main tools will be the generalisation of a sic povm into a _",
    "sic system _ and of mubs into _ mutually unbiased povms_.    the basic idea is easily established by considering the qubit case : there a sic is found to be a natural joint observable of three povms that are smearings of three mutually unbiased binary observables . it turns out that these povms have a similar relation as mutually unbiased bases and they will therefore be referred to as mutually unbiased povms .",
    "characteristic properties of mutually unbiased povms arising as marginals of sics in dimension @xmath1 are established ; these properties will be referred to as sic compatibility conditions .",
    "we show that whenever a complete system of mutually unbiased commutative povms is obtained from a sic , it is possible to extract a complete system of mubs .    the condition for a sic possessing @xmath0 mutually unbiased povms as marginals is found to be equivalent to there being @xmath2 orthogonal latin squares of size @xmath1 .",

    "as we have argued before , in this language we are restricted to having at most @xmath0 mutually unbiased striations . assuming that these @xmath41 points are placed into a @xmath97 array , one begins by defining the horizontal and vertical striation in the logical way , and so any further mutually unbiased striation will correspond to a latin square because , as in our construction , we can not allow for any line to contain two points from the same row or column .",

    ", one can show that the operators @xmath55 form a sic system , that is they satisfy all properties of a sic with the possible exception of positivity , which does not follow naturally .    with these findings",
    "we have established the beginnings of a correspondence between a sic and a complete set of @xmath0 mubs .",
    "the bridge providing this connection is provided by the concept of a complete system of mutually unbiased povms that will be marginals of the sic .",
    "there are , however , obstructions to the existence of this bridge .",
    "first , the number of mutually unbiased povms that can be obtained as marginals of a sic is no less than 3 but also no greater than 2 plus the maximal number of orthogonal latin squares of order @xmath1",
    ". the maximal number of mutually unbiased povms will thus be @xmath0 when @xmath1 is a prime power , but it is unknown whether this number can be obtained for any other values of @xmath1 .",
    "second , the problem remains of extracting mubs from such a system of mutually unbiased povms ; we have obtained a solution only in the case where all the povms are commutative .",
    "third , starting with a system of @xmath0 mubs ( where they exist ) , one can obtain @xmath0 mutually unbiased povms by applying an appropriate smearing by application of a doubly stochastic matrix to the spectral measures associated with the mubs .",
    "however , in order to reconstruct a sic via the formula , it is required that for the underlying @xmath259 array there exist @xmath41 downward paths of length @xmath1 which satisfy the 1-overlap property  this was found again to be equivalent to the requirement that there are @xmath508 orthogonal latin squares of order @xmath1 .    to illustrate the significance of these limitations",
    ", we revisit the case of a 6-dimensional hilbert space . in this case there",
    "do not exist two mutually orthogonal latin squares of order 6 , and so there are no systems of mutually unbiased marginals of a sic with more than 3 elements . as a consequence of proposition [ prop : abequiv ] , since there do not exist seven @xmath509-partitions with the 1-overlap property in a @xmath510 array , there can not exist 36 downward paths with the 1-overlap property in a @xmath511 array .",
    "so even if we hypothesized the existence of 7 mubs for @xmath39 , it is impossible to construct a sic from them via formula , although sics are known to exist for @xmath39 @xcite .    to summarize : the existence in @xmath8 of a bridge between a complete system of mubs and a sic via mutually unbiased povms and the formula requires the existence of the maximal number @xmath2 of mutually orthogonal latin squares .",
    "but even when the conditions of the recovery of a sic system from a system of @xmath0 mutually unbiased povms are fulfilled , the problem remains of ensuring the positivity of the operators @xmath55 , @xmath512 . by construction , these operators satisfy @xmath513}=1 $ ] and @xmath514}=1 $ ] . using an observation made in @xcite , the operators",
    "@xmath515 are positive ( and in fact rank-1 projections ) if , in addition , @xmath516}=1 $ ] .",
    "+ the positivity of the sic system elements depend on the doubly stochastic matrices @xmath517 used in smearing our mutually unbiased spectral measures , but these pose their own set of problems . by demanding that their coefficients are positive ( and hence real ) and less than or equal to 1 , and that their rows satisfy conditions and , we are able to drastically reduce the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , if we simplify the situation by further requiring that the rows of a given doubly stochastic matrix @xmath517 , whose rows satisfy and , are given as cyclic permutations of the elements in the first row , then the entire matrix is determined by a single element of this row , with all other elements of the matrix arising as a result . however , the value of this variable lies within a continuous interval , and no particular value need immediately stand out as significant .",
    "further to this , it is not known beforehand how many different doubly stochastic matrices need to be used - that is , how many spectral measures are smeared in the same way and how many require a different smearing - in order to retrieve a sic povm ( in the case of a sic system , a single matrix - that is , all spectral measures are smeared in the same way - will suffice ) .",
    "the issue of the number of paths does not need discussion here ; given that there are @xmath518 possible downwards paths through a @xmath259 array , as described in section [ sec : mub->sic ] ( excluding the 1-overlap property here ) , it is computationally simple to perform a check of all possible paths to see if they form positive operators . + as an example of these issues , in the case of @xmath330 , where we begin with 4 mutually unbiased spectral measures ,",
    "there are several possible doubly stochastic matrices , of which we choose one , that can be used on 3 of the spectral measures , and then the fourth measure must be smeared by the doubly stochastic matrix whose first row is @xmath519 and whose remaining rows are cyclic permutations of this .",
    "it is also the case that this doubly stochastic matrix can be used on all four mutually unbiased spectral measures and will still lead to a sic povm .",
    "+ the sic  mub bridge constructed here is based on two combinatorial schemes that were noted to be equivalent ; we showed that this dual combinatorial structure corresponds one - to - one to a dual geometric structure of affine planes that was posited in a study of wootters @xcite in which he laid out analogous schemes for constructing mubs and sics .",
    "the operator systems needed to start wootters schemes are not given _ a priori _ while in our approach these operators were given and the geometric / combinatorial structures appeared by necessity .",
    "+ finally , in section [ sec : wh - cov ] we showed that all these facts find a natural application to finite covariant phase space observables in prime power dimension @xmath3 @xmath403 .",
    "indeed , it turns out that a covariant phase space observable on a @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space generates @xmath0 mutually unbiased and commutative marginal povms , which in turn are smearings of @xmath0 mubs .",
    "such marginal povms are associated to each @xmath1-partition of the finite phase space into parallel affine lines .",
    "moreover , in theorem [ theo : opcharct ] , we provided various characterizations of sic covariant phase space observables ; in particular , item ( iii ) establishes an operational link between the sic property of the covariant phase space observable @xmath466 and the @xmath0 mubs associated with the @xmath0 mutually unbiased marginal povms of @xmath466 .",
