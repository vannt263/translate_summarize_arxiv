    "from the figures ( [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] ) one can see that in the inclusive setup of the process of charged pairs production by interaction of linearly polarized high energy photon with proton distribution of recoil proton has rather essential azimuthal asymmetry , from 0.02 at the relatively small polar angles @xmath19 up to @xmath70 at @xmath71 .     for the cases of @xmath67 pair , @xmath68 pair and @xmath69 pair production and also @xmath72 as function of scattering angle @xmath19 . ]    in exclusive setup for processes with more heavy particles than e@xmath73e@xmath74 , mentioned asymmetry increases .",
