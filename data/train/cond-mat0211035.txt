    "in the monte carlo simulation , we sometimes suffer from the problem of slow dynamics .",
    "the critical slowing down near the critical point , the phase separation dynamics at low temperature , the slow dynamics due to the randomness or frustration , and the low - temperature slow dynamics in quantum monte carlo simulation are examples of the problems of slow dynamics .",
    "we may classify the attempts to conquer the slow dynamics in the monte carlo simulation into two categories .",
    "the first category is the cluster algorithm , such as the swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithm @xcite and the wolff algorithm @xcite .",
    "the second one is the extended ensemble method .",
    "the multicanonical method @xcite , the broad histogram method @xcite , and the flat histogram method @xcite are examples of the second category .",
    "recently , wang and landau @xcite proposed an efficient algorithm to accelerate the calculation of the energy density of states ( dos ) .",
    "yamaguchi and okabe @xcite have successfully used the wang - landau algorithm for the study of the antiferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts models .    tomita and okabe @xcite recently proposed an effective cluster algorithm , which is called the probability - changing cluster ( pcc ) algorithm , of tuning the critical point automatically .",
    "the pcc algorithm is an extension of the sw algorithm @xcite ; we change the probability of connecting spins of the same type , essentially the temperature , in the process of the monte carlo spin update .",
    "we showed the effectiveness of the pcc algorithm for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) potts models @xcite , determining the critical point and exponents .",
    "we can extract information on critical phenomena with much less numerical effort .",
    "the pcc algorithm is quite useful for studying random systems , where the distribution of the critical temperature , @xmath1 , is important .",
    "we applied the pcc algorithm to the 2d diluted ising model @xcite , investigating the crossover and self - averaging properties of random systems .",
    "we also extended the pcc algorithm to the problem of the vector order parameter @xcite ; studying the 2d xy and clock models , we showed that the pcc algorithm is also useful for the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite .",
    "the combination of approaches of two categories , the cluster algorithm and the extended ensemble method , is a challenging problem .",
    "janke and kappler @xcite proposed a trial to combine the multicanonical method and the cluster algorithm ; their method is called the multibondic ensemble method .",
    "recently , yamaguchi and kawashima @xcite improved the multibondic ensemble method , and also showed that the combination of the wang - landau algorithm and the improved multibondic ensemble method yields much better statistics compared to the original multibondic ensemble method @xcite .    here",
    ", we pick up two recent topics of new monte carlo algorithms .",
    "we first discuss the generalization of the pcc algorithm .",
    "this generalized scheme is based on the finite - size scaling ( fss ) property of the correlation ratio .",
    "second , for the algorithm to combine the cluster algorithm and the extended ensemble method , we derive a rigorous broad histogram relation for the bond number , and propose the flat histogram method for the bond number .",
    "we start with reviewing the idea of the pcc algorithm @xcite .",
    "we explain the case of the ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 we construct the kasteleyn and fortuin ( kf ) @xcite clusters using the probability @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the probability of connecting spins of the same type , @xmath4 .",
    "the correspondence of the spontaneous magnetization of the @xmath0-state potts model and the percolation probability of the bond percolation model was discussed by hu @xcite .",
    "then , we check whether the system is percolating or not .",
    "if the system is percolating ( not percolating ) in the previous test , we decrease ( increase ) @xmath3 by @xmath5 .",
    "spins are updated following the same rule as the sw algorithm . after repeating the above processes",
    ", the distribution of @xmath3 for monte carlo samples approaches the gaussian distribution of which mean value is @xmath6 ; @xmath6 is the probability of connecting spins , such that the existence probability @xmath7 becomes 1/2 .",
    "the existence probability @xmath7 @xcite is the probability that the system percolates .",
    "since @xmath7 follows the fss near the critical point , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the critical value of @xmath3 for the infinite system and @xmath10 is the correlation - length critical exponent , we can estimate @xmath9 from the size dependence of @xmath6 using eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) and , in turn , estimate @xmath1 through the relation @xmath11 .    in the original formulation of the pcc algorithm @xcite",
    ", we used the kf representation in two ways .",
    "first , we make a cluster flip as in the sw algorithm @xcite .",
    "second , we change the probability of connecting spins of the same type , @xmath3 , depending on the observation whether clusters are percolating or not .",
    "the point is that @xmath7 has the fss property with a single scaling variable .",
    "we may use quantities other than @xmath7 which have a similar fss relation . in the fss analysis of the monte carlo simulation",
    ", we often use the binder ratio @xcite , which is essentially the ratio of the moments of the order parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the moment ratio has the fss property with a single scaling variable , @xmath13 as far as the corrections to fss are negligible .",
    "the angular brackets indicate the thermal average .",
    "the moment ratio derived from a snapshot spin configuration is always one ; therefore , the instantaneous moment ratio can not be used for the criterion of judgment whether we increase or decrease the temperature .    as another quantity ,",
    "we may treat the correlation ratio , the ratio of the correlation functions with different distances . for an infinite system at the critical point",
    ", the correlation function decays as a power of @xmath14 , @xmath15 with the decay exponent @xmath16 .",
    "precisely , the distance @xmath14 is a vector , but we have used a simplified notation . away from the critical point , the ratio of the distance @xmath14 and the correlation length @xmath17 plays a role in the scaling of the correlation function .",
    "moreover , for finite systems , two length ratios , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , come in the scaling form of the correlation function . then , the ratio of the spin - spin correlation functions with different distances @xmath14 and @xmath20 takes the fss form with a single scaling variable , @xmath21 if we fix two ratios , @xmath18 and @xmath22 . in case",
    "the correlation length diverges with a power law , @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ corr_ratio ] ) becomes the same form as eq .",
    "( [ mom_ratio ] ) ; however , eq .  ( [ corr_ratio ] ) is also applicable to the case of the kt transition , where the correlation length diverges more strongly than the power - law divergence .    in order to examine the fss properties of the correlation ratio , we here give the result of the 2d 6-state clock model on the square lattice with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the 2d @xmath0-state clock model is known to exhibit two phase transitions of the kt type at @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we simulate the 2d 6-state clock model by the use of the wang - landau algorithm @xcite .",
    "we show the temperature dependence of both the moment ratio @xmath28 and the correlation ratio @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] . as for the distances",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath20 , we choose @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; we take the horizontal or vertical direction of the lattice for the orientation of two sites . for the correlation ratio ,",
    "the curves of different sizes merge in the intermediate kt phase ( @xmath32 ) , and spray out for the low - temperature ordered and high - temperature disordered phases , which is expected from the fss form of eq .",
    "( [ corr_ratio ] ) .",
    "then , we can make a fss analysis based on the kt form of the correlation length , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "using the data of @xmath29 for @xmath35=12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 48 , and 64 , we estimate two kt transition temperatures . the best - fitted estimates are @xmath24=0.698(4 ) and @xmath25=0.898(4 ) , in units of @xmath36 , which are compatible with the recent results using the pcc algorithm @xcite , @xmath24=0.7014(11 ) and @xmath25=0.9008(6 ) . on the contrary , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , the corrections to fss are larger for the moment ratio , which makes the fss analysis difficult . we have shown that the correlation ratio is a good estimator especially for the kt transition .",
    "it is due to the fact that we only use the property of correlation function ; the characteristic of the kt transition is that the correlation function shows a power - law decay at all the temperatures of the kt phase .     and the correlation ratio @xmath29 of the 2d 6-state clock model for @xmath35 = 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 48 , and 64 . ]",
    "we may use the fss properties of the correlation ratio for the generalization of the pcc algorithm . instead of checking whether the clusters are percolating or not",
