    "recently more and more evidence has been accumulated that for dynamical improved wilson fermions at a lattice spacing of @xmath0 the cutoff  effects are much larger than expected from quenched experience ( for a summary of large scaling violations in the two  flavor  theory see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as an extreme example , for three flavors the existence of a phase transition in the @xmath1@xmath2plane has been numerically conjectured and is interpreted as a lattice artifact @xcite .",
    "in addition several collaborations have reported algorithmic difficulties with ( improved ) wilson fermions on relatively coarse lattices ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which seem to be related to small eigenvalues of the dirac operator . through the inversion of the dirac operator these small eigenvalues can result in large driving force during the molecular dynamics evolution of hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithms . in turn ,",
    "the large forces are likely to trigger instabilities of the numeric integrator employed , which produces large hamiltonian violations and can result in long periods of rejection @xcite . in this way",
    "small eigenvalues affect algorithmic performance .",
    "the occurrence of very small eigenvalues generates not only algorithmic problems . on the configurations in question",
    "the quark propagator becomes large and one observes ",
    "spikes  in fermionic correlation functions .",
    "this affects not only their mean value but also their autocorrelation function , making the statistical analysis difficult .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for dynamical simulations",
    "this is an unexpected problem since navely it is assumed that the determinant should suppress small eigenvalues compared to the quenched situation . in our setup",
    "we have two infrared cutoffs ( finite quark mass and schrdinger functional boundary conditions ) that should prevent the dirac operator from developing very small eigenvalues .",
    "nevertheless we observe them in simulations with a lattice spacing of about @xmath3 . here",
    "we show that these small eigenvalues disappear if one goes to smaller lattice spacings and can thus be interpreted as a lattice artifact .",
    "we simulate the schrdinger functional ( sf ) with two dynamical flavors of non  perturbatively improved wilson fermions .",
    "the algorithms used are hmc with two pseudo  fermion fields @xcite and phmc @xcite . in the following",
    "the term eigenvalue always refers to the eigenvalue ( in lattice units ) of the square of the hermitian even  odd ",
    "preconditioned wilson  dirac operator in the normalization of @xcite . for phmc the parameters of the polynomial",
    "are chosen such that more configurations with small eigenvalues are produced compared to the qcd boltzmann weight .",
    "after reweighting this gives a very good estimate of the path  integral weight of such configurations .",
    "another benefit of using phmc is that the polynomial provides a regularized inversion , thus also addressing the algorithmic problems due to large forces mentioned above . with this algorithm the correct ensemble average of an estimator @xmath4",
    "is given by + @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the reweighting factor @xcite and the subscript @xmath7 indicates an average over the phmc  generated ensemble .",
    "type algorithms are expensive and generate strongly autocorrelated data , which makes a careful data analysis indispensible .",
    "we use an explicit integration of the autocorrelation function as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to obtain a histogram for a quantity @xmath8 we analyze @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the characteristic function of the @xmath11-th bin .",
    "this also provides us with an error on the population of the bin , thus giving us the ability to assess differences between histograms .",
    "if the phmc algorithm is used , the bin population is given by @xmath12",
    "in order to test the nave expectation that the fermionic determinant suppresses small eigenvalues we compare quenched and dynamical ensembles of @xmath13 lattices at roughly matched physical parameters . using the quenched data from ref .",
    "@xcite and the dynamical data from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite we cohose the parameters such that the lattice spacing and the ( large volume ) pseudo  scalar mass are matched .",
    "the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue @xmath14 is shown in figure [ cutoff ] .",
    "the quite small error bars we obtain from eq .",
    "[ phmc ] at the lower end of the spectrum are due to the enhanced occurrence of small eigenvalues by phmc . while @xmath15 is increased from @xmath16 to @xmath17 with two dynamical flavors we see that in the infrared tail the dynamical data show more events .",
    "more precisely , the probability of finding a smallest eigenvalue below @xmath18 increases from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . to show that this long tail towards zero is a cutoff  effect we now compare dynamical data from different lattice spacings at matched parameters .     from matched quenched ( @xmath21 ) and two  flavor dynamical simulations ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "through measurements of the sf coupling @xmath23 @xcite we found that increasing @xmath1 from 5.2 to 5.5 changes the lattice spacing by roughly a factor of @xmath24 . anticipating that the algorithmic problems due to very small eigenvalues would no longer be present at this finer lattice spacings we used hmc with two pseudo  fermions to generate an ensemble of @xmath25 lattices . ignoring small changes in the renormalization factor we compare this to an @xmath26 phmc ensemble at @xmath22 , which is matched using @xmath27 , the box size times the bare pcac mass . to plot both lattice spacings simultaneously we divide by @xmath15 in figure [ roughmatch ] .",
    ", width=294 ]    going from @xmath28 to @xmath29 reduces the variance ( normalized by the mean value ) of the smallest eigenvalue from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "the long tail at the infrared has disappeared at the finer lattice spacing and we thus interpret it as a cutoff  effect .    in a final step",
    "we compare the dynamical data at @xmath32 to another quenched run at approximately the same lattice spacing ( @xmath33 ) , volume and bare quark mass .    in figure [ matchfine ] both the quenched and the dynamical data show very similar behavior at the infrared end of the spectrum .",
    "a comparison to figure [ cutoff ] shows that the excess of very small eigenvalues we found at the coarser lattice spacing has disappeared entirely . as at @xmath34 the average smallest eigenvalue",
    "is still shifted upwards by the fermionic determinant .    .",
    "[ matchfine],width=294 ]",
    "the problems in simulating dynamical wilson fermions at a lattice spacing of approximately @xmath3 are due to the occurrence of very small eigenvalues in the spectrum of the wilson  dirac operator .",
    "we use phmc to better sample this part of the spectrum in a comparison of two  flavor and quenched simulations at matched physical parameters .",
    "as expected we find the _ average _ smallest eigenvalue to be larger in the dynamical case .",
    "however , due to its increased variance the dynamical data shows more _ very _ small eigenvalues despite the finite quark mass and the cutoff provided by the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we conclude that at @xmath22 , corresponding to a lattice spacing of @xmath3 , the spectrum of the wilson  dirac operator is strongly distorted .",
    "our simulations show that this is a cutoff  effect that disappears rapidly with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "we do not expect that these findings are specific to the schrdinger functional . without the additional infrared cutoff due to the boundary conditions",
    "one should see these problems already at larger quark masses .",
