    "<S> a simple quantum mechanical model consisting of a discrete level resonantly coupled to a continuum of finite width , where the coupling can be varied from perturbative to strong , is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the particle is initially localized at the discrete level , and the time dependence of the amplitude to find the particle at the discrete level is calculated without resorting to perturbation theory and using only elementary methods . the deviations from the exponential decay law , predicted by the fermi s golden rule , are discussed .    the transition of a quantum particle from an initial discrete state of energy @xmath0 into continuum of final states is considered in any textbook on quantum mechanics . it is well known that perturbation theory approach , when used to solve the problem , leads to fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) , which predicts the exponential decrease of the probability to find the particle in the discrete state . </S>",
    "<S> it is also well known that , even for a weak coupling between the discreet state and the continuum , this result ( exponential decrease of probability ) has a finite range of applicability , and is not valid either for very small or for very large time ( see e.g. cohen - tannoudji et . </S>",
