    "within standard cold dark matter scenarios the formation of galaxies is a hierarchical and biased process .",
    "large galaxies are thought to be assembled through the merging of smaller systems , and the most massive objects will form in over  dense regions , which will eventually evolve into the clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore important to find and study the progenitors of the most massive galaxies at the highest possible redshifts .",
    "radio sources are convenient beacons for pinpointing massive elliptical galaxies , at least up to redshifts @xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the near  infrared ` hubble ' @xmath13 relation for such galaxies appears to hold up to @xmath14 , despite large k ",
    "correction effects and morphological changes ( lilly and longair 1984 ; van breugel et al .  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "this suggests that radio sources may be used to find massive galaxies and their likely progenitors out to very high redshift .    while optical , ` color  dropout ' techniques have been successfully used to find large numbers of normal young galaxies ( without dominant agn ) at redshifts surpassing those of quasars and radio galaxies(@xcite ) , the radio and near  infrared selection technique has the additional advantage that it is unbiased with respect to the amount of dust extinction .",
    "high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) are therefore also important laboratories for studying the large amounts of dust ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and molecular gas ( @xcite ) , which are observed to accompany the formation of the first forming massive galaxies .    using newly available , large radio surveys",
    "we have begun a systematic search for @xmath11 hzrgs to be followed by more detailed studies of selected objects . in this letter , we present deep intermediate resolution vlt / fors1 spectroscopy of tn  j1338@xmath11942  which , at @xmath0 , was the first @xmath2 radio galaxy discovered in the southern hemisphere ( @xcite ) , and is one of the brightest and most luminous ly@xmath3objects of its class .    in  2",
    ", we describe the discovery and previous observations of tn  j1338@xmath11942 . in  3 we describe our vlt observations , and in  4 we discuss some of the implications of our results . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume @xmath15  km  s@xmath16mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17=0.15 , and @xmath18 . at @xmath19 ,",
    "this implies a linear size scale of 7.5  kpc / arcsec .",
    "the method we are using to find distant radio galaxies is based on the empirical correlation between redshift and observed spectral index in samples of low - frequency selected radio sources ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . selecting radio sources with ultra steep spectra ( uss )",
    "dramatically increases the probability of pinpointing high - z radio galaxies , as compared to observing radio galaxies with more common radio spectra .",
    "this method , which can to a large extent be explained as a k - correction induced by a curvature of the radio spectra , has been shown to be extremely efficient ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we constructed such a uss sample ( @xmath20 ; @xcite ) , consisting of 669 objects , using several radio catalogs which , in the southern hemisphere , include the texas 365  mhz catalog ( @xcite ) and the nvss 1.4  ghz catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "as part of our search  program we observed tn  j1338@xmath11942  ( @xmath21 ) with the eso 3.6 m telescope in 1997 march and april ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radio source was first identified by taking a 10 minute @xmath22band image .",
    "followup spectroscopy then showed the radio galaxy to be at a redshift of @xmath23 , based on a strong detection of ly@xmath3 , and weak confirming  @xmath24  1549  and  @xmath24  1640 . at this redshift",
    "its derived rest  frame low frequency ( 178  mhz ) radio luminosity is comparable to that of the most luminous 3cr sources .    more detailed radio information was obtained with the vla at 4.71  ghz and 8.46  ghz on 1998 march 24 , as part of a survey to measure rotation measures in hzrgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "we detect two radio components ( @xmath25 mjy ; @xmath26 mjy ) separated by 55 in the field of the radio galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ kradio ] ) .",
    "the bright nw component has a very faint radio companion ( @xmath27 mjy ) at 14 to the se .",
    "our present observations show that all components have very steep radio spectra with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the proximity and alignment of such rare uss components strongly suggests that they are related and part of one source . while further observations over a wider frequency range would be useful to confirm this , for",
    "now we conclude that tn  j1338@xmath11942  is a very asymmetric radio source , and identify component c at @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the radio core .",
    "such asymmetric radio sources are not uncommon ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and are usually thought to be due to strong interaction of one of its radio lobes with very dense gas or a neighboring galaxy ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we also obtained a @xmath33band image with the near infrared camera ( nirc ; @xcite ) at the keck i telescope on ut 1998 april 18 .",
    "the integration time was 64 minutes in photometric conditions with 05 seeing .",
    "observing procedures , calibration and data reduction techniques were similar to those described in van breugel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . using a circular aperture of 3 , encompassing the entire object , we measure @xmath34 ( we do not expect a significant contribution from emission lines at the redshift of the galaxy ) . in a 64  kpc metric aperture ,",
    "the magnitude is @xmath35 , which puts tn  j1338@xmath11942  at the bright end , but within the scatter , of the @xmath13 relationship ( @xcite ) .",
    "we determined the astrometric positions in our @xmath36 @xmath22band image using the usno pmm catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "we next used the positions of nine stars on the r - band image in common with the keck @xmath33band to solve the astrometry on the @xmath37 @xmath33band image .",
    "the error in the _ relative _ near  ir / radio astrometry is dominated by the absolute uncertainty of the optical reference frame , which is @xmath404 ( 90% confidence limit ; @xcite ) . in figure [ kradio ] , we show the overlay of the radio and @xmath33band ( _ rest - frame _ @xmath38band ) images .",
    "the nw hotspot coincides within 0035 of the peak of the @xmath33band emission , while some faint diffuse extensions can be seen towards the radio core and beyond the lobe .",
    "the positional difference between the peak of the @xmath33band emission and the radio core is 14 ( @xmath39 ) , which suggests that the agn and peaks of the @xmath33band and ly@xmath3  emission may not be co  centered .",
    "because of the importance of tn  j1338@xmath11942  as a southern laboratory for studying hzrgs , we obtained a spectrum of this object with high signal  to  noise and intermediate spectral resolution with fors1 on the antu unit of the vlt on ut 1999 april 20 .",
    "the purpose of these observations was to study the ly@xmath3  emission and uv  continuum in detail .",
    "the radio galaxy was detected in the acquisition images ( @xmath40  s ; @xmath41 in a 2  aperture ) .",
    "we used the 600r grism with a 13 wide slit , resulting in a spectral resolution of 5.5    ( fwhm ) .",
    "the slit was centered on the peak of the @xmath33band emission at a position angle of 210  north through east . to minimize the effects of fringing in the red part of the ccd",
    ", we split the observation into two 1400  s exposures , while offsetting the object by 10  along the slit between the individual exposures .",
    "the seeing during the tn  j1338@xmath11942  observations was @xmath407 and conditions were photometric .",
    "data reduction followed the standard procedures using the noao iraf package .",
    "we extracted the one - dimensional spectrum using a 4wide aperture , chosen to include all of the ly@xmath3  emission .",
    "for the initial wavelength calibration , we used exposures of a hearne lamp .",
    "we then adjusted the final zero point of the wavelength scale using telluric emission lines .",
    "the flux calibration was based on observations of the spectrophotometric standard star ltt2415 , and is believed to be accurate to @xmath42 .",
    "we corrected the spectrum for foreground galactic extinction using a reddening of @xmath43 determined from the dust maps of @xcite .    in figure [ tn1338spec ]",
    "we show the observed one dimensional spectrum and in figure [ 2dlya ] the region of the two - dimensional spectrum surrounding the ly@xmath3  emission line .",
    "most notable is the large asymmetry in the profile , consistent with a very wide ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath16 ) blue - ward depression .",
    "following previous detection of ly @xmath3 absorption systems in hzrgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) we shall interpret the blue - ward asymmetry in the ly@xmath3  profile of tn  j1338@xmath11942  as being due to foreground absorption by neutral hydrogen .",
    "frame equivalent width of ly@xmath3  in tn  j1338@xmath11942 @xmath5   , is twice as high as in the well  studied radio galaxy 4c  41.17 ( @xmath45 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the large ly@xmath3  luminosity ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath16 after correction for absorption ) makes tn  j1338@xmath11942  the most luminous ly@xmath3  emitting radio galaxy known .",
    "following @xcite , we measure the continuum discontinuity across the ly@xmath3  line , defined as [ @xmath47 = @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , for the lyman limit at @xmath49 = 912 , we find [ @xmath50 = @xmath51 , though this value is uncertain because the flux calibration at the edge of the spectrum is poorly determined .",
    "the presence of these continuum discontinuities further confirm our measured redshift .",
    "however , the redshift of the system is difficult to determine accurately because our vlt spectrum does not cover  @xmath24  1549  or  @xmath24  1640 .",
    "furthermore , since the ly@xmath3  emission is heavily absorbed , it is likely that the redshift of the peak of the ly@xmath3  emission ( at @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) does not exactly coincide with the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "we shall assume @xmath0 .",
    "tn  j1338@xmath11942  shares several properties in common with other hzrgs but some of its characteristics deserve special comment . here",
    "we shall briefly discuss these .",
    "assuming photoionization , case b recombination , and a temperature of @xmath54  k we use the observed ly@xmath3  emission to derive a total mass ( @xmath55 ) of the  gas ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) using @xmath56  m@xmath57 . here @xmath58 is the filling factor in units of 10@xmath59 , @xmath60 is the ly@xmath3luminosity in units of @xmath61  ergs  s@xmath16 , and @xmath62 is the total volume in units of @xmath63  @xmath64 . assuming a filling factor of 10@xmath59 ( @xcite ) , and a cubical volume with a side of 15  kpc",
    ", we find @xmath65  m@xmath57 .",
    "this value is on the high side , but well within the range that has been found for hzrgs ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ) .",
    "previous authors have shown that gas clouds of such mass can cause radio jets to bend and decollimate ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , the extreme asymmetry in the tn  j1338@xmath11942  radio source could well be the result of strong interaction between the radio  emitting plasma and the ly@xmath3gas .",
    "our spectrum also shows evidence for deep blue - ward absorption of the ly@xmath3  emission line .",
    "we believe that this is probably due to resonant scattering by cold  gas in a halo surrounding the radio galaxy , as seen in many other hzrgs ( c.f . ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the spatial extent of the absorption edge as seen in the 2-dimensional spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) implies that the extent of the absorbing gas is similar or even larger than the 4(30  kpc ) ly@xmath3  emitting region .    to constrain the absorption parameters we constructed a simple model that describes the ly@xmath3  profile with a gaussian emission function and a single voigt absorption function . as a first step",
    ", we fitted the red wing of the emission line with a gaussian emission profile . because the absorption is very broad , and extends to the red side of the peak",
    ", the parameters of this gaussian emission profile are not well constrained .",
    "we adopted the gaussian that best fits the lower red wing as well as the faint secondary peak , 1400 km s@xmath16 blue - wards from the main peak .",
    "the second step consisted of adjusting the parameters of the voigt absorption profile to best match the sharp rise towards the main peak .",
    "the resulting model ( shown along with the parameters of both components in figure [ lyamodel ] ) adequately matches the main features in the profile .",
    "we varied the parameters of both components , and all acceptable models yield column densities in the range @xmath66 @xmath7 .",
    "the main difference between our simple model and the observations is the relatively flat , but non  zero flux at the bottom of the broad depression . this flux is higher than the continuum surrounding the ly@xmath3line , indicating",
    "some photons can go through ( i.e. ,  a filling factor less than unity ) or around the absorbing cloud .",
    "if the angular size of absorber and emitter are similar , the size of the absorber is @xmath67 @xmath410  kpc .",
    "the total mass of neutral hydrogen then is @xmath68 , comparable to or somewhat less than the total mass of .      following @xcite , and assuming that the rest frame uv continuum is due to young stars",
    ", one can estimate the star ",
    "formation rate ( sfr ) in tn  j1338@xmath11942  from the observed rest  frame uv continuum near 1400   . from our spectrum",
    "we estimate that @xmath69 , resulting in a uv luminosity @xmath70 erg  s@xmath16  @xmath16 and implying a sfr between 90 @xmath1 720 h@xmath71 m@xmath57 yr@xmath16 in a @xmath72  kpc@xmath73 aperture .",
    "these values are similar to those found for 4c  41.17 . in this case",
    "detailed hst images , when compared with high resolution radio maps , strongly suggested that this large sfr might have been induced at least in part by powerful jets interacting with massive , dense clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the co ",
    "spatial ly@xmath3  emission  line and rest  frame optical continuum with the brightest radio hotspot in tn  j1338@xmath11942  suggests that a similar strong interaction might occur in this very asymmetric radio source .",
    "the decrement of the continuum blue - wards of ly@xmath3  ( fig .",
    "[ tn1338spec ] ) due to the intervening  absorption along the cosmological line of sight is described by the `` flux deficit '' parameter @xmath74 ( @xcite ) . for tn",
    "j1338@xmath11942  we measure @xmath75 , comparable to the @xmath76 that @xcite found for the @xmath77 radio galaxy 8c  1435 + 64 ( uncorrected for galactic reddening ) .",
    "this is only the second time the @xmath8 parameter has been measured in a radio galaxy .",
    "the decrement described by @xmath8 is considered to be extrinsic to the object toward which it has been measured , and should therefore give similar values for different classes of objects at the same redshift . because they have bright continua , quasars have historically been the most popular objects to measure @xmath8 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "quasars have measured values of @xmath79 ( e.g. ,  schneider , schmidt & gunn 1991 , 1997 ) .",
    "similar measurements for color selected lyman break galaxies do not yet exist .",
    "other non - color selected objects , in addition to radio galaxies , which do have reported @xmath8 measurements are serendiptiously discovered galaxies ( @xmath80 , @xcite ) and narrow - band ly@xmath3-selected galaxies ( @xmath81 , @xcite ) .",
    "because of their larger redshifts these galaxy values can not directly be compared with those of quasars ( @xmath82 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , they seem to fall slightly ( @xmath83 ) below the theoretical extrapolation of madau ( 1995 ) at their respective redshifts , which quasars do follow rather closely .",
    "this is also true for the two radio galaxies ( @xmath84 ) at their redshifts .",
    "thus it appears that non - color selected galaxies , whether radio selected or otherwise , have @xmath8 values which fall below those of quasars .    although , with only two measurements , the statistical significance of the low radio galaxy @xmath8 values is marginal , the result is suggestive .",
    "it is worthwhile contemplating the implications that would follow if further observations of @xmath2 radio galaxies and other objects selected without an optical color bias confirmed this trend . given that optical color selection methods ( often used to find quasars , and lyman break galaxies ) favour objects with large @xmath8 values , it is perhaps not surprising that non - color selected @xmath11 objects might have lower values of @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , quasars and galaxies with low @xmath8 values might be missed in color  based surveys .",
    "this then could lead to an underestimate of their space densities , and an overestimate of the average  columns density through the universe .",
    "radio galaxies have an extra advantage over radio selected quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , because they very rarely contain bal systems ( there is only one such example , 6c  1908 + 722 at @xmath85 ; @xcite ) .",
    "such bal systems are known to lead to relatively large values of @xmath8 , indicating that part of the absorption is not due to cosmological hi gas , but due to absorption within the bal system ( @xcite ) .",
    "a statistically significant sample of @xmath11 radio galaxies would therefore determine the true space density of intervening  absorbers .",
    "because of its enormous ly@xmath3  luminosity and strong continuum , its highly asymmetric and broad ly@xmath3  profile , and its very asymmetric radio / near  ir morphology tn  j1338@xmath11942  is a unique laboratory for studying the nature of @xmath2 hzrgs .",
    "it is particularly important to investigate the statistical properties of similar objects by extending the work begun here to a significant sample of @xmath2 hzrgs .",
