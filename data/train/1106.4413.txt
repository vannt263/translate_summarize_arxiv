    "the cosmic optical background ( cob ) is the optical component of the extragalactic background light , which is the integrated radiation from all light sources outside the galaxy .",
    "dominant contribution to the cob comes from stellar nucleosynthesis in galaxies at redshifts @xmath10 , while other mechanisms such as mass accretion to super massive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , gravitational collapse of stars , and particle decay can contribute to the cob brightness . as a fossil record of light production activity in the universe ,",
    "the cob conveys information on the cosmic star formation history including birth and death of population iii stars .",
    "comparison of the measured cob brightness and the integrated brightness of resolved galaxies has fundamental importance , since it provides a direct clue as to the fraction of celestial visible light whose origin is known to us .",
    "however , robust detection of the cob has long been hampered by the extremely bright foreground emissions . while expected brightness of the cob is around 1 bgu @xmath11 @xmath12 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 sr@xmath5 @xmath5 ,",
    "the terrestrial airglow and the zodiacal light ( zl ) are a few orders of magnitude brighter than this level at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "besides these brightest two components , the diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) , which refers to scattered starlight by the interstellar dust , is another but much fainter component of the diffuse light of the night sky .",
    "@xcite attempt a cob measurement by subtracting all the foreground components from the night - sky brightness observed at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the terrestrial airglow is assumed to follow a function of the zenith angle with temporal variation , while the zl brightness is estimated from equivalent width of an imprinted solar fraunhofer line on the zl spectrum , making use of the fact that the solar spectrum is well reproduced in the zl due to weak wavelength dependence in scattering strength of the interplanetary dust .",
    "@xcite devised the method to utilize galactic dark clouds as shielding walls of the cob . by comparing the brightness measured at two lines of sight , one toward a dark cloud and one toward a nearby `` transparent '' sky , the background light coming from behind the dark cloud",
    "could be extracted . however , these and other similar attempts were not very successful due to inadequate knowledge about the foreground radiations , especially spatial and temporal variations of their brightness .",
    "one of the fundamental solutions to the problem of foreground subtraction is to carry out measurements at outside the relevant emission regions .",
    "@xcite utilizes the measurements of the night - sky brightness by a photopolarimeter on board the _ pioneer 10 _ spacecraft .",
    "he analyzes the data obtained at the heliocentric distances larger than 3.3 au , where the zl is found to be negligible @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , though , galactic stars can not be resolved due to poor spatial resolution of the instrument , which dominate the measured sky brightness and prevent robust detection of the cob .",
    "the latest attempt is made by @xcite , who carried out a coordinated observation program using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and a ground - based telescope at las campanas observatory . the terrestrial airglow is avoided by using space observations , while the zl brightness is estimated by a similar method to @xcite , i.e. , from measured equivalent width of a solar fraunhofer line reproduced in the zl .",
    "the dgl brightness is estimated using a simple scattering model and thermal emission brightness of the interstellar dust .",
    "however , a number of problems in their analysis are raised by @xcite , e.g. , inappropriate assumptions in deriving the zl and dgl brightness . a series of corrections to the original papers are presented in @xcite and @xcite , and the derived cob brightness is now accompanied by significant errors ; the latest values are ( 6 @xmath2 4 ) , ( 10 @xmath2 5 ) , and ( 7 @xmath2 4 ) bgu at the 0.30 , 0.55 , and 0.80 @xmath1 m band , respectively .    here",
    "we present the new constraints on the cob brightness obtained from an original analysis of the night - sky data taken by the imaging photopolarimeters ( ipps ) on board the _ pioneer 10 _ and _ 11 _ spacecrafts .",
    "the present work gives a significant improvement of the previous analysis by @xcite by taking advantage of the additional higher - quality ( _ pioneer 11 _ ) data , accurate all - sky star catalogs , and a realistic dgl model combined with the far - infrared ( ir ) space observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and reductions of the data used in this work , including data assessment and map creation processes .",
    "subtraction of the galactic light , namely , the starlight and the dgl , are presented in section 3 .",
    "then we show the results in section 4 , followed by discussion on the derived correlation between the dgl and the far - ir emission and on the resolved fractions of the cob in section 5 .",
    "finally a summary appears in section 6 .",
    "hereafter the _ pioneer 10 _ and _ 11 _ spacecrafts are sometimes abbreviated as `` p10 '' and `` p11 '' .",
    "all the magnitudes are given in the vega - based system .",
    "here we describe the observations and reductions used in this work . while a similar analysis is carried out by @xcite for the investigation of the galactic diffuse emission , we clarify the two major differences between their and the present analysis as follows .",
    "( 1 ) stellar contribution is removed from the _ each _ instrument field of view ( fov ) before creating the final , high - resolution sky maps in this work , rather than first creating star - contaminated maps and then evaluating the stellar contribution in them . considering the large instrument fov ( low angular resolution ) ,",
    "the former method is more suitable than the latter to derive the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission as we will see below .",
    "( 2 ) the data quality is evaluated at a few stages in the middle of the data processing in this work , which allows us the accurate understanding of the uncertainties in the final results .",
    "the _ pioneer 10 _ and its sister ship _ pioneer 11 _ are nasa s space missions , which were launched on 1972 march 2 and 1973 april 5 , respectively .",
    "they are the first spacecrafts to travel through the asteroid belt and explore the outer solar system .",
    "one of the scientific instruments on board the spacecrafts is the ipp , which was designed to make two - color ( blue and red ) maps of the brightness and polarization over the sky during cruise phase of the missions @xcite .",
    "the ipp data taken at the heliocentric distances @xmath13 = 1  5 au were used to study distribution of the interplanetary dust responsible for the zl and diffuse light components outside the zl clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "below we give a description of the ipp measurements and the primary data processing . for more details , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ipp is equipped with a 2.5 cm maksutov - type telescope , together with a wollaston prism , multilayer filters , and two dual - channel bendix channeltrons @xcite .",
    "it measures simultaneously two orthogonal polarization components of brightness in two ( blue at the wavelengths 0.39  0.50 @xmath1 m and red at 0.60 ",
    "0.72 @xmath1 m ; `` @xmath14 '' and `` @xmath15 '' hereafter ) broad - band filters .",
    "effective wavelengths of the two bands are 0.44 @xmath1 m and 0.64 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "the two polarization components are defined with `` s '' vector parallel to the instrument rotation axis and `` p '' vector which is perpendicular to it . thus one ipp exposure generates four surface brightness measurements , @xmath16 ( s - vector component ) and @xmath17 ( p - vector component ) at each of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 band .",
    "the four measurements are carried out by the different photocathodes placed at the end of the different optical paths .",
    "the data used in the present work was obtained with the `` zl mode '' , with instantaneous fov of 2@xmath18.29 @xmath3 2@xmath18.29 .",
    "sky brightness is integrated for 1/64 ( one `` sector '' ) of a 12.5 s spacecraft spin period , resulting in effective fov of 2@xmath18.29 @xmath3 ( 2@xmath18.29 @xmath19 5@xmath18.625 sin@xmath20 ) where @xmath20 is the angle between the instrument pointing and the spacecraft spin axis ( called `` look angle '' ) . with a change of look angle , the effective",
    "fov ranges from 7.5 deg@xmath21 ( @xmath20 = 170@xmath18 ) to 18 deg@xmath21 ( @xmath20 = 90@xmath18 ) .",
    "since the single - pixel detector is used in each of the four channels , the fov of the detector size also gives the angular resolution of the instrument .",
    "a data cycle of the ipp measurements consists of 10 rolls ; eight for sky measurements , one for photometric calibration using a self - luminous phosphor source , and one for monitoring offset and dark - current levels .",
    "sky maps are created by changing look angle @xmath20 and repeating the data cycles .",
    "primary processing of the obtained data has been carried out by the ipp team .",
    "initially absolute photometric calibration is achieved using the pre - flight measurements of a @xmath22c - activated self - luminous phosphor source .",
    "instrument pointings ( coordinates of fov centers ) are computed from the spacecraft attitude parameters .",
    "the brightness contribution of bright stars is subtracted referring to stars in the yale bright star catalog @xcite and @xmath23 stars in the u.s .",
    "naval observatory ( usno ) photoelectric catalog @xcite . finally , observed star crossings and in - flight measurements of the internal phosphor source are used to correct for temporal variation of the instrument sensitivity and to revise telescope pointings .",
    "the final position accuracy of fovs is 0@xmath18.15  0@xmath18.40 .",
    "the processed data are stored in the background sky tape @xcite , which is now available from nasa s national space science data center .    using the _ pioneer 10 _ ipp data collected at the various heliocentric distances @xmath13 , @xcite find that the zl brightness at @xmath13 = 2.41 au is less than 10 % of that observed at @xmath13 = 1 au , and that the zl brightness is below the detectable level of the instrument when the spacecraft is at or beyond @xmath13 = 3.26 au .",

    "trilegal generates and spatially distributes stars according to the user - defined parameters , such as star formation rate , age  metallicity relation , initial mass function , and distribution geometry , and then predicts stellar photometry at any field of the galaxy ( also at star clusters and nearby galaxies ) .",
    "we adopt the default set of parameters for deriving galactic star counts at the bessel @xmath67 and @xmath13 bands down to 32.0 mag .",

    "the errors are derived from the data scatters , which arise from the following three main causes : the ipp measurement errors , uncertainties in the estimation and the subtraction of galactic starlight , and intrinsic scatters of dgl - to-100 @xmath1 m brightness ratios .",

    "since @xmath124 has a larger uncertainty than the original 100 @xmath1 m brightness due to the various assumptions made , e.g. , those made in estimating dust temperatures , accuracy of the 100 @xmath1 m brightness would be considerably better .",
    "in addition , the 32 @xmath3 32 pixel binning applied in the present work should further reduce random errors .    while the better 100 @xmath1 m brightness map is presented by @xcite , their improved reprocessing of the _ iras _ survey ( iris ) map includes point sources and thus can not be compared directly to our diffuse emission maps .",
    "however , a very good agreement is found between the iris and @xcite data sets at scales larger than @xmath125 @xcite where the present analysis focuses on ( note the ipp map resolution of @xmath50 ) .",
    "hence , we do not expect a significant change of the final results when the iris map is alternatively used after point - source removal .    in figure [ vs100um ]",
    ", we clearly detect the linear correlations between @xmath116 and @xmath114 at the large @xmath114 , and more importantly , the expected breaks at @xmath126 mjy sr@xmath5 at the both ipp bands .",
