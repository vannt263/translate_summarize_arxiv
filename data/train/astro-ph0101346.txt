    "xte j1118 + 480 is a new transient x - ray source , discovered in soft ( @xmath3 kev ) x - rays by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) onboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in 2000 march ( remillard et al . 2000 ) . within days",
    "optical ( uemura , kato & yamaoka 2000a ) , radio ( pooley & waldram 2000 ) and hard x - ray ( wilson & mccollough 2000 ) counterparts to the new transient were established .",
    "uemura et al . ( 2000b ) report in detail the discovery and subsequent photometric observations of the optical counterpart .",
    "garcia et al . ( 2000 ) reported strong h@xmath4 emission , and established that the interstellar extinction towards the source was very low .",
    "this fact allowed for the first time euv observations of an x - ray transient ( hynes et al .",
    "patterson ( 2000 ) further reported rapid and erratic variability in the optical flux from the system .",
    "merloni , di matteo & fabian ( 2000 ) have modelled the rapid optical variability as synchrotron emission from magnetic flares in a corona above the accretion disc .",
    "the x - ray properties of xte j1118 + 480 , both in timing and spectra , indicate that the system is a black hole ( candidate ) in the low / hard x - ray state ( revnivtsev , sunyaev & borozdin 2000 ; wood et al .",
    "2000 ) , characterised by strong low - frequency variability and a hard power - law component extending to @xmath5 kev which dominates any contribution in x - rays from an accretion disc .",
    "the radio spectrum of the system is persistently inverted in the range 122 ghz ( dhawan et al .",
    "2000 ; hynes et al .",
    "2000 ) with a spectral index ( @xmath4 , where @xmath6 ) of about + 0.5 .",
    "such flat or inverted radio spectra have been established as a ubiquitous observational characteristic of the low / hard x - ray state in both peristent and transient black hole x - ray binaries ( fender 2000a , b ) .",
    "during a 100-day period between mjd 51620  51720 xte j1118 + 480 exhibited a steady level of x - ray and radio emission .",
    "the observations reported below were obtained during this steady phase .",
    "more recently the source has declined rapidly again ( since around mjd 51745 ) .",
    "regular monitoring of xte j1118 + 480 has been undertaken by the very large array ( vla ) throughout the 2000 outburst . during the interval",
    "mjd 51620  51720 , the mean flux densities at 1.4 , 8.4 and 22.5 ghz were @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 mjy respectively , where uncertainties reflect the statistical deviation or the sample ( intrinsic source variability and/or calibration errors ) rather than the significance of the detections .",
    "[ [ rt ] ] rt ~~    the ryle telescope ( rt ) was used to monitor the flux density at 15.2 ghz , using techniques similar to those described in pooley & fender ( 1997 ) .",
    "the phase calibrator used was j1110 + 440 , and the flux - density scale established by observations of 3c48 and 3c286 . the mean flux density measured by the rt over the period under discussion was @xmath10 mjy .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 was observed by merlin on 2000 apr 5 16502053 ut , in standard continuum observing mode at 4.994 ghz with a 15 mhz bandwidth , and primary and secondary flux calibrators 3c286 and oq208 .",
    "to phase - calibrate the target source a 6 minute cycle nodding between the target and phase calibrator 1107 + 485 was used .",
    "even with the short integration time and therefore incomplete @xmath11 coverage , a fully calibrated image of 1118 + 480 was obtained ( fig 1 ) .",
    "the image has a 1 @xmath12 noise level of 248 @xmath13jy / beam with a synthesised beam of 65 @xmath14 35 mas at 90 degrees from north .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 is an unresolved point source at co - ordinates ra(2000 ) 11 18 10.794 dec(2000 ) + 48 02 12.42 with a flux density of 5.16 mjy .",
    "the merlin run was simultaneous with an observation with the rt , which measured a flux density of @xmath15 mjy at 15 ghz , confirming the inverted spectrum ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 was observed at 350 ghz ( 850 @xmath13 m ) with the scuba instrument on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on 2000 may 30 and 31 .",
    "the atmospheric optical depth at 850 @xmath13 m was variable but around 0.4 during both observations ( based on skydips and measurements from the nearby caltech submillimetre observatory ) .",
    "flux calibration was performed using uranus and cit6 .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 is clearly detected on both nights ( with no variability at @xmath17% level between the two runs ) .",
    "the mean flux density from the two nights observations is @xmath18 mjy , the error being dominated by the uncertainty in the flux conversion factor .",
    "another observation of the source at 350 ghz was performed on 2000 september 9 , at which time only a ( 3@xmath12 ) upper limit of 21 mjy was obtained .",
    "given the decay in radio emission from xte j1118 + 480 by this time this supports the association of the submillimetre source with the x - ray transient .",
    "in fender ( 2000a , b ) it has been shown that all x - ray binaries in the low / hard x - ray state produce a flat or inverted radio spectrum ( i.e. @xmath19 ) , which is likely to extend spectrally to the millimetre or infrared regimes .",
    "this spectral component is likely to arise in a partially self - absorbed synchrotron emission from a relativistic outflow or jet from each system .",
    "the power into this outflow appears to be a significant ( @xmath20% ) and approximately fixed fraction of the accretion luminosity . in the following",
    "we discuss the observations of xte j1118 + 480 in the context of such a model .",
    "the flux density of the unresolved component imaged with merlin is consistent with the radio spectrum measured by the vla and rt , therefore we can be confident that all the radio emission from xte j1118 + 480 arises within a region smaller than the merlin beam .",
    "we note that the ( one - sided ) radio jet from cyg x-1 in the low / hard state has an angular extent of @xmath21 mas at 8 ghz ( stirling , spencer & garrett 1998 ; stirling et al .",
    "2000 ) , at a distance of @xmath22 kpc . given a comparable ghz flux density we might expect a similar angular extent from xte j1118 + 480 , so the 35 @xmath14 65 mas beam probably failed to resolve the core by less than a factor of 10 ( and the system may have been resolveable with the vlba , depending on orientation ) .",
    "fig 2 plots the broadband spectrum ( sed ) of xte j1118 + 480 , from radio to near - infrared wavelengths , during the @xmath23-day steady period in the low / hard x - ray state ( see also hynes et al .",
    "2000 for a more extensive sed , but without the sub - millimetre datum ) . within uncertainties dominated by the non - simultaneity of the observations ,",
    "the radio data correspond to a power - law of spectral index @xmath1 .",
    "the jcmt measurement sits exactly on an extrapolation of this power - law to the sub - millimetre regime .",
    "we therefore consider it most likely that emission at 350 ghz is an extension of the inverted spectral component from the radio .",
    "furthermore , the significant decrease in the 350 ghz flux density when the source was reobserved in 2000",
    "september , by which point the radio flux density had also dropped dramatically , supports this interpretation .",
    "it is unlikely that our detection of the system at 350 ghz is exactly at the high - frequency break of the inverted spectral component , however comparison with the near - infrared fluxes reported by hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) indicates that some break , probably to an optically thin spectrum , occurs before @xmath24 hz ( fig 2 ) . naively assuming that the inverted spectral component continues with a spectral index of @xmath25 and then breaks at one point to an optically thin spectrum with @xmath26 ( a typical value ) which connects with the lowest - frequency near - infrared point ( see below ) , the break will occur around @xmath27 hz ( 40 @xmath13 m ) , with a peak flux density of about 150 mjy",
    "this crude ` fit ' to the radio  mm  infrared data is plotted in fig 2 .",
    "three sets of near - infrared observations have been reported , in hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and taranova & seranova ( 2000 ) ; these are plotted in fig 3 . since the extinction to the source is very low ( e(b - v)=0.013  hynes et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is not necessary to deredden the infrared data .",
    "bearing in mind that an accretion disc should have a thermal spectrum with spectral index in the range @xmath28 , it appears that there is excess infrared emission at the longest wavelengths ( @xmath29 @xmath13 m , ie . in the k - band and beyond ) .",
    "hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have already noted that another source of near - infrared flux ( beyond an accretion disc ) is present .",
    "since the sub - mm detection clearly demonstrates that the inverted spectral component does not cut off in the radio band , it seems plausible to connect it to the excess emission in the near - infrared . the reader is reminded that there is already very strong evidence for synchrotron emission from the radio through the millimetre to the near - infrared from the black hole system grs 1915 + 105 when in hard x - ray states ( e.g. fender & pooley 1998 , 2000 and references therein ) , and that fender ( 2000b ) presents observational evidence that the synchrotron spectrum may extend to the near - infrared or even optical regimes in _ all _ black hole x - ray binaries which are in the low / hard x - ray state .",
    "the integrated 1350 ghz luminosity of the inverted - spectrum component is @xmath30 erg s@xmath31 .",
    "when in the low / hard x - ray state , cyg x-1 has a typical xte asm count rate of 20 ct / sec ; it is assumed to lie at a distance of @xmath22 kpc and has an integrated x - ray luminosity ( dominated by the power - law component ) of @xmath32 erg s@xmath31 ( di salvo et al .",
    "2000 ) . therefore , under the ( reasonable ) assumption that all x - ray binaries in the low / hard state have comparable spectra , we scale from cyg x-1 to derive the relation @xmath33 erg s@xmath31 , where @xmath34 is the xte / asm 2 - 12 kev count rate .",
    "the mean xte asm count rate for xte j1118 + 480 at the time of our observations was around 2 , so in this case @xmath35 erg s@xmath31 .",
    "broadband x - ray observations ( mcclintock et al . 2000 ) confirm this estimate of the 2200 kev luminosity to within a factor of two , validating the method ( however those authors also note that the x - ray spectrum may peak at even higher energies in this source ) .",
    "note that simply using measured soft x - ray fluxes from xte j1118 + 480 , such as those reported in remillard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) will underestimate the x - ray luminosity , which normally peaks around 100 kev in the hard state , but has been accurately measured for cyg x-1 . from this , @xmath36 ; this should be considered as a firm lower limit to the ratio of jet to x - ray luminosities ( assuming the impossible case of a 100% radiatively efficient jet ) , unless the x - ray spectrum of xte j1118 + 480 really turns out to be very different from that of cyg x-1 at higher ( @xmath37 kev ) energies .",
    "if the jet spectrum is something like the dual power - law ` fit ' shown in fig 2 , then the integrated luminosity of the _ inverted _ spectral component is @xmath38 erg s@xmath31 .",
    "however the radiative luminosity is dominated by the extent of the high - frequency emission ; regardless of the spectral form at lower frequencies , if the jet contributes @xmath39 mjy at @xmath40 hz then the integrated radiative luminosity @xmath41 erg s@xmath31 .",
    "even if the jet spectrum peaks at 350 ghz and a power law ( with @xmath43 ) connects directly from the submillimetre to the infrared regimes @xmath44 is reduced from that of the ` fit ' by less than 10% .",
    "the total jet power can be estimated as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the radiative efficiency of the jet and @xmath47 is a correction for relativistic motion ( fender 2000b ) .",
    "assuming @xmath48 ( which seems reasonable  fender 2000b and references therein ) , and @xmath49 ( ie .",
    "no significant relativistic correction ) , the jet power will be @xmath50% of the integrated x - ray luminosity , and therefore a very significant factor indeed for the energetics of the system .",
    "how reasonable is the assumption @xmath51 ?",
    "dubus et al . ( 2000 ) estimate the orbital inclination of the binary to be @xmath52 based on optical spectroscopy .",
    "for @xmath53 , @xmath54 ; ie .",
    "the maximum we could be _ overestimating _ the jet power by is a factor of 5 , whereas we could be _ underestimating _ it by two orders of magnitude .",
    "merloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that the rapid optical variability of xte j1118 + 480 , and in particular its correspondence with x - ray variability , indicates that the optical flux is generated in the inner regions of the accretion disc , and is of nonthermal origin .",
    "rapid near - infrared variability in phase with x - ray variability has been directly observed from grs 1915 + 105 ( eikenberry et al .",
    "1998 ; mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) , and in this source there is little doubt that the infrared flux is associated with powerful relativistic ejections ( fender & pooley 1998 , 2000 ; dhawan , mirabel & rodriguez 2000 ) . in cyg x-3",
    "rapid near - infrared flares are also probably associated with a relativistic jet ( fender et al .",
    "since we have argued that the excess near - infrared flux is associated with the jet emission , and rapid near - infrared variability seems often to be associated with jet sources , we suggest that the rapid optical flaring in xte j1118 + 480 is also associated with the jet , probably being optically thin nonthermal synchrotron emission from the ` base ' of the jet , very close to the accretion disc . this is similar to the model of merloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , except that we envisage the sites of optical emission as being associated with a global structure which , at radio wavelengths at least , is resolved into a collimated outflow .",
    "we have presented radio and sub - mm observations of the x - ray transient xte j1118 + 840 , and combined them with published near - infrared data to present the broadband spectrum of the system from 1  @xmath55 ghz during a steady period of low / hard x - ray state emission .",
    "the radio spectrum is inverted , with @xmath16 , consistent with flat / inverted spectra from partially self - absorbed jets being a generic feature of the low / hard x - ray state ( fender 2000a , b ) .",
    "two lines of argument are presented to argue that this spectral component extends from the radio regime through to the near - infrared :    * the detection of the system at 350 ghz ( 850 @xmath13 m ) precisely on an extrapolation of the inverted radio spectrum .",
    "this clearly indicates that the inverted spectral component extends significantly beyond the radio band . * excess flux in reported near - infrared measurements .",
    "three sets of reported near - infrared photometry of xte j1118 + 480 all reveal evidence for excess , apparently non - thermal , infrared emission in about the k - band and beyond    using these two observational facts , we argue that the inverted spectral component extends from the radio regime all the way to the near - infrared or optical regimes . if this is the case , then the ratio of jet power to x - ray luminosity is @xmath56 , where @xmath46 is the radiative efficiency of the jet ( see fender 2000b ) . for discrete ejection events from grs 1915 + 105 ( which clearly have a flat / inverted spectrum extending from the radio , through the mm , to the near - infrared regime )",
    "the maximum radiative efficiency appears to be @xmath57 ( fender & pooley 2000 ) ; therefore the jet power is likely to be a major , if not perhaps dominant , power output channel for the system in this x - ray state .",
    "it is interesting to think about the size scales associated with the jet ; for a blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) jet the physical size associated with emission at a given frequency scales as @xmath58 . if we assume the jet to have similar dimensions to that of cyg x-1 , ie . @xmath59",
    "au at 8 ghz , then emission at 350 ghz will arise from a region of size scale @xmath60 au .",
    "if the inverted component does peak around @xmath61 hz , this would correspond to a size scale of around 0.03 au , or @xmath62 cm .",
    "the optically thin emission observed in the near - infrared will come from even smaller phyiscal scales , whose size would be best constrained by rapid variability .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 is not unique in showing evidence for jet emission extending to the near - infrared when in the ` canonical ' low / hard x - ray state .",
    "fender ( 2000b ) argues that the synchrotron spectrum probably extends to the near - infrared or optical regimes in all x - ray binaries in this state .",
    "corbel & fender ( 2001 ) and corbel et al . (",
    "2001 ) present further evidence for near - infrared synchrotron emission from gx 339 - 4 and xte j1550 - 564 when in the low / hard x - ray state , a persistent and transient source respectively .",
    "brocksopp et al .",
    "( 2000 ) finds similarities in the optical properties of low / hard state transients , which may also be related to high - frequency synchrotron emission associated with the jet .",
    "however in most cases the sub - mm and far - infrared regimes , crucial for establishing the connection between the radio and near - infared emission , are not explored .",
    "such observations , admittedly technically difficult , are vital for confirming our qualitative model and establishing that in the low / hard x - ray state the jet can be a major channel for the output of accretion power from black holes . in a more theoretical study markoff , falcke & fender ( 2001 ) have applied a jet - dominated model to the broadband radio through x - ray spectrum of xte j1118 + 480 , and found that even the power - law x - ray component may arise as in the jet , possibly as direct optically thin synchrotron emission . in this case",
    "more than 90% of the power output of the system is in the form of the jet . while ironically the model of markoff et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is unable to fit the jcmt datum , one of the motivations in this paper for arguing for the presence of a jet , the overall fit to the broadband spectrum is striking , with important implications for the interpretation of hard x - ray spectra if correct .",
    "we would like to thank the staff of the jcmt for approval and execution of these observations at short notice .",
