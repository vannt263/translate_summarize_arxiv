    "in recent years many attempts to modify gravity have been done to explain large and short scale phenomena .",
    "this modifications seem to be necessary when one desires to go beyond general relativity .",
    "one proposal comes from adding higher - order curvature invariants and non - minimally coupled scalar fields into dynamics resulting from the effective action of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "such corrective terms seem to be unavoidable if we want to obtain the effective action of quantum gravity on scales closed to the planck length @xcite .",
    "therefore terms of the form @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 have to be added to the effective lagrangian of gravitational field when quantum corrections are considered .",
    "these higher curvature terms can be included in more general forms known as @xmath5 theories and further generalizations .",
    "another proposal comes from modifying the short scale behavior in an attempt to include quantum gravitational effects in the description . to this purpose , noncommutative geometry ,",
    "gravity s rainbow and generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) have been widely used to keep under control ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences .",
    "for example in a noncommutative spacetime , one introduces a commutator @xmath6 = i\\,\\theta ^{\\mu \\nu } $ ] , where @xmath7 is an antisymmetric matrix which determines the fundamental discretization of spacetime .",
    "this feature eliminates point - like structures in favor of smeared objects in flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may consider the possibility that noncommutativity could cure the divergences that appear in general relativity .",
    "the effect of the smearing is mathematically implemented with a substitution of the dirac - delta function by a gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath8 . in particular , the energy density of a static and spherically symmetric , smeared and particle - like gravitational source has been considered in the following form @xcite@xmath9where the mass @xmath10 is diffused throughout a region of linear dimension @xmath11 due to the intrinsic uncertainty encoded in the coordinate commutator . on the other hand ,",
    "when gravity s rainbow is considered , spacetime is endowed with two arbitrary functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 having the following properties@xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath13 appear into the solutions of the modified einstein s field equations@xcite@xmath16where @xmath17 is an energy dependent newton s constant , defined so that @xmath18 is the low - energy newton s constant and @xmath19 is an energy dependent cosmological constant . usually @xmath20 is the energy associated to the particle deforming the spacetime geometry . since the scale of deformation involved is the planck scale , it is likely that spacetime itself begins to fluctuate in such a way to produce a zero point energy ( zpe ) . in absence of matter fields ,",
    "the only particle compatible with the deformed einstein s gravity is the graviton . as regards the _ generalized uncertainty principle _",
    "( gup)@xcite which is a modification of the heisenberg uncertainty relations , we find that@xmath21where @xmath22 is the planck constant and @xmath23 is the planck length .",
    "when the gup is applied to the liouville measure , the modified number of quantum states is@xmath24for @xmath25 , the formula reduces to the ordinary counting of quantum states . if eq.@xmath26 is used for computing black hole entropy , the usual divergence which appear ( brick wall ) can be removed@xcite . to conclude",
    ", one could also include , as a further example of a theory which takes under control uv divergences , a very recent and interesting theory known as hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) theory .",
    "this is based on a modification of einstein gravity motivated by the lifshitz theory in solid state physics@xcite@xcite .",
    "this modification allows the theory to be power - counting uv renormalizable and should recover general relativity in the infrared ( ir ) limit .",
    "nevertheless , hl theory has the unpleasant feature of being noncovariant .",
    "noncommutative geometry , gravity s rainbow , gup and hl theory are all examples of _ distorted gravity_. usually calculations involving quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field manifest uv divergences .",
    "to keep under control the uv divergences , one invokes a standard regularization / renormalization process .",
    "however in distorted gravity this procedure can be avoided@xcite , especially when a zpe calculation is considered .",
    "what makes a zpe calculation interesting is that it is strictly related to the casimir effect .",
    "casimir effect has many applications and it can be considered under different points of view , but it can also be used as a tool to probe another appealing production of the gravitational field theory : a wormhole . a wormhole is often termed einstein - rosen bridge because a _ bridge _  connecting two sheets  was the result obtained by a. einstein and n. rosen in attempting to build a geometrical model of a physical elementary `` particle '' that was everywhere finite and singularity free@xcite .",
    "it was j.a .",
    "wheeler who introduced the term wormhole@xcite , although his wormholes were at the quantum scale .",
    "we have to wait for m. s. morris and k. s. thorne@xcite to see the subject of wormholes seriously considered by the scientific community . in practice",
    "a traversable wormhole is a solution of the einstein s field equations , represented by two asymptotically flat regions joined by a bridge or , in other word , it is a short - cut in space and time . to exist",
    ", traversable wormholes must violate the null energy conditions , which means that the matter threading the wormhole s throat has to be _",
    "exotic_. classical matter satisfies the usual energy conditions .",
    "therefore , it is likely that wormholes must belong to the realm of semi - classical or perhaps a possible quantum theory of the gravitational field . on this ground , the casimir energy on a fixed background . has the correct properties to substitute the exotic matter : indeed , it is known that , for different physical systems , casimir energy is negative .",
    "usually one considers some matter or gauge fields which contribute to the casimir energy necessary to the traversability of the wormholes , nevertheless nothing forbids to use the casimir energy of the graviton on a background of a traversable wormhole . in this way",
    ", one can think that the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field of a traversable wormhole are the same ones which are responsible to sustain traversability . in this contribution , as an example of distorted gravity , we will fix our attention primarily on gravity s rainbow with one extension to noncommutative geometry .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows , in section [ p2 ] we define what is a self - sustained traversable wormhole , in section [ p3 ] we compute the zpe graviton energy responsible of the self sustained traversable wormhole in the context of distorted gravity , in section [ p4 ] we relax the convergence conditions of the integrals involved in the self - sustained calculation .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ p5 ] .",
    "units in which @xmath27 are used throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we shall consider the formalism outlined in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the graviton one loop contribution to a classical energy in a wormhole background is used .",
    "the spacetime metric representing a spherically symmetric and static wormhole is given by @xmath28where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath31 , denoted as the redshift function , and the shape function , respectively @xcite .",
    "the radial coordinate has a range that increases from a minimum value at @xmath32 , corresponding to the wormhole throat , to infinity .",
    "a fundamental property of a wormhole is that a flaring out condition of the throat , given by @xmath33 , is imposed @xcite , and at the throat @xmath34 , the condition @xmath35 is imposed to have wormhole solutions .",
    "another condition that needs to be satisfied is @xmath36 . for the wormhole to be traversable",
    ", one must demand that there are no horizons present , which are identified as the surfaces with @xmath37 , so that @xmath29 must be finite everywhere . in order to describe a self - sustained traversable wormhole",
    ", we need to define the classical energy .",
    "a key point is given by the background field super - hamiltonian , @xmath38 .",
    "this can be built with the help of the arnowitt - deser - misner ( @xmath39 ) decomposition@xcite of space time based on the following line element@xmath40where @xmath41 is the _ lapse _ function and @xmath42 the _ shift _ function . in terms of the @xmath39 variables",
    ", the four dimensional scalar curvature @xmath43 can be decomposed in the following way@xmath44where@xmath45\\]]is the second fundamental form , @xmath46 @xmath47 is its trace , @xmath48 is the three dimensional scalar curvature and @xmath49 is the three dimensional determinant of the metric .",
    "the last term in @xmath50 represents the boundary terms contribution where the four - velocity @xmath51 is the timelike unit vector normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces ( t = constant ) denoted by @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the acceleration of the timelike normal @xmath51 .",
    "thus@xmath54 = \\sqrt{-\\text{\\/\\thinspace \\thinspace } ^{4}\\text{\\/{}\\negthinspace } g}\\ \\mathcal{r}=\\frac{n}{16\\pi g}% \\sqrt{g}\\text { } \\left [ k_{ij}k^{ij}-k^{2}+\\,r-2\\nabla _ { \\mu } \\left ( ku^{\\mu } + a^{\\mu } \\right ) \\right ]   \\label{lag}\\]]represents the gravitational lagrangian density and @xmath55 is the newton s constant . after a legendre transformation ,",
    "we obtain two classical constraints:@xmath56and@xmath57@xmath58 is the super - metric and the super - momentum @xmath59 is defined as@xmath60note that @xmath61 represents the classical constraint which guarantees the invariance under time reparametrization .",
    "the other classical constraint represents the invariance by spatial diffeomorphism and the vertical stroke @xmath62  denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the @xmath63 metric @xmath64 .",
    "note that boundary terms become important when one compares different configurations like wormholes and dark stars@xcite or wormholes and gravastars@xcite .",
    "when we deal with spherically symmetric line elements , the kinetic term disappears and the hamiltonian constraint @xmath65 reduces to@xmath66where we have integrated on a constant time hypersurface @xmath38 and where we have used the explicit expression of the scalar curvature in three dimensions in terms of the shape function .",
    "therefore , from the hamiltonian point of view , it is not necessary to assume that @xmath67 .",
    "a traversable wormhole is said to be _ self sustained _",
    "if@xmath68where @xmath69 is the total regularized graviton one loop energy .",
    "basically this is given by @xmath70 \\",
    ", ,   \\label{onel}\\]]where @xmath71 denotes a complete set of indices and @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the eigenvalues of the modified lichnerowicz operator@xmath74acting on traceless - transverse tensors of the perturbation and where @xmath75is the lichnerowicz operator defined by@xmath76with @xmath77 . for the background @xmath78 , one can define two r - dependent radial wave numbers@xmath79where@xmath80are two r - dependent effective masses @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "when we perform the sum over all modes , @xmath69 is usually divergent . in refs .",
    "@xcite a standard regularization / renormalization scheme has been adopted to handle the divergences . in this contribution , we will consider the effect of gravity s rainbow and noncommutative geometry on the graviton to one loop .",
    "one advantage in using such a scheme is to avoid the renormalization process and to use only one scale : the planck scale .",
    "one of the purposes of eq.@xmath83 is the possible discovery of a traversable wormhole with the determination of the form of the shape function .",
    "however , one could also reverse the strategy : we fix the wormhole shape to see if the self - sustained equation is satisfied .",
    "one good candidate is@xmath84which is the prototype of the traversable wormholes@xcite . plugging the shape function @xmath85 into eq.@xmath86 , we find that the left hand side becomes@xmath87while the right hand side is divergent . to handle with divergences",
    ", we have several possibilities .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite a regularization / renormalization scheme has been adopted and the wormhole throat has been fixed at the value @xmath88 . if we adopt a noncommutative scheme@xcite , the distorted liouville measure@xmath89allows the computation of the graviton to one loop .",
    "this is possible because the distortion induced by the noncommutative space time allows the right hand side of eq.@xmath83 to be finite . indeed , plugging @xmath90 into eq.@xmath83 , one finds that the self - sustained equation for the energy density becomes@xmath91where we have used the shape function @xmath85 to evaluate the effective masses @xmath92 . by defining the dimensionless variable@xmath93eq.@xmath94 leads to @xmath95@xmath96where@xmath97@xmath98 has a maximum for @xmath99 , where@xmath100this fixes @xmath101 to be@xmath102and@xmath103when we consider gravity s rainbow , spacetime is endowed with two arbitrary functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 having the properties shown in @xmath104 . as shown in ref.@xcite , the self - sustained equation @xmath83 becomes @xmath105where the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.@xmath106 is represented by@xmath107and@xmath108respectively .",
    "@xmath109 is the value which annihilates the argument of the root . of course , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are finite for appropriate choices of the rainbow s functions @xmath15 and @xmath112 .",
    "if we assume that@xmath113with @xmath114 , the classical term is not distorted .",
    "we find@xmath115and@xmath116where we have fixed the shape function as in eq.@xmath85 .",
    "now , in order to have only one solution with variables @xmath117 and @xmath32 , we demand that@xmath118 \\,=\\frac{d}{% dr_{0}}\\left [ \\frac{2}{3\\pi ^{2}}\\left ( i_{1}+i_{2}\\right ) \\right ] \\,,\\]]which takes the following form after the integration @xmath119@xmath120where @xmath121 and where @xmath122@xmath123 and @xmath124 are the modified bessel function of order 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "one finds a root at@xmath125with @xmath126 .",
    "this means that @xmath127 .",
    "it is immediate to understand that the example coming from noncommutative geometry appears to be _",
    "rigid_. with this term we mean that the distorted liouville measure can not assume different forms . on the other hand , gravity s rainbow depends on the choice of @xmath15 and @xmath112 . in this short presentation",
    "we have explored only the gaussian proposal @xmath128 which strongly cuts off the planckian and trans - planckian physics . to this purpose",
    ", we would like to considerably relax the convergent form of the rainbow s functions to see if there are some effects on the traversability of the wormhole .",
    "in this part of the contribution , we would like to explore a relaxed variant of the choice @xmath128 .",
    "the situation we are going to consider is the following .",
    "it is easy to see that if we assume@xmath129@xmath130 and @xmath131 reduce to@xmath132and@xmath133as a specific choice for the shape function we will take under consideration old examples suggested by morris and thorne@xcite:@xmath134and@xmath135for both of them , we will also assume that @xmath67 both the examples @xmath136 and @xmath137 satisfy@xmath138as regards the choice @xmath136 , one finds@xmath139and the flare out condition is satisfied on the throat . to see",
    "if the wormhole can be self - sustained , we plug the shape function @xmath140 into @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath106 simply becomes@xmath141where we have explicitly used the form of the shape function @xmath140 on the classical term . on the throat , the effective masses",
    "become@xmath142and eq.@xmath143 simplifies into@xmath144the explicit calculation of @xmath145 leads to    @xmath146 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath147 .",
    "the solution can be easily computed numerically and we find @xmath148 . as regards the choice @xmath137 , one finds@xmath149 and , once again , the flare out condition is satisfied on the throat . in this case",
    ", the self - sustained equation reduces to@xmath150 the effective masses become on the throat@xmath151 and eq.@xmath152 simplifies into@xmath153 the explicit calculation of @xmath154 leads to    @xmath155 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath147 . even in this case , the solution can be easily computed numerically and we find @xmath156 .",
    "note that the form in @xmath157 is a special case of a shape function of the form@xmath158 which is obtained imposing an equation of state @xmath159 .",
    "in this contribution we have discussed how some forms of distorted gravity can be used to power a traversable wormhole . the distorted liouville measure @xmath160 has been used as an example of noncommutative geometry .",
    "we have obtained a solution compatible with the procedure located at @xmath161@xcite .",
    "note that in ref.rgfsnlplb , a shape form induced by a density profile of the form @xmath162 but with an ordinary regularization / renormalization procedure .",
    "it is beyond this contribution to investigate the shape function obtained by @xmath163 combined with the distorted liouville measure @xmath160 gives a traversable wormhole . as regards gravity s rainbow ; the good news is that every shape function analyzed is traversable .",
    "the bad news is that the traversability is in principle but not in practice , even if the radii are greater that the radius discovered in ref.@xcite and also larger than the one obtained with the measure @xmath160 .",
    "indeed , all the wormholes discovered survive in the planckian or trans - planckian regime .",
    "this is because we are probing a region where the gravitational field develops quantum fluctuations so violent that it is also able to give a topology change@xcite .",
    "since the wormhole s radius is of the planckian size , we have explored a relaxed version of the rainbow s functions to see if the smallness of the wormhole radius is a consequence of the strong convergence induced by the choice @xmath164 .",
    "once again , the resulting wormhole is traversable in principle but not in practice .",
    "this means that we can interpret the self - sustained equation as an ignition equation . to obtain a larger radius ,",
    "one possibility is to use the self - sustained equation in the following manner@xmath165 ,   \\label{log}\\]]where @xmath166 is the order of the approximation . in this way , if we discover that fixing the radius to some value of a fixed background of the r.h.s . , and we discover on the l.h.s . a different radius",
    ", we could conclude that if the radius is larger that the original , the wormhole is growing , otherwise is collapsing .",
    "note that in ref.@xcite , eq . @xmath167 has been used to show that a traversable wormhole can be generated with a topology change starting from a minkowski spacetime .",
