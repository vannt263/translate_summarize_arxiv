    "this is especially valuable in the inner jet , before deceleration by shocks alters the density and velocity structure .",
    "detailed jet mass - loss histories of a population of intermediate - mass protostars can provide a time - resolved view of the mass assembly of stars in the poorly understood intermediate - mass range ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) where changes in the physics of formation between low- and high - mass stars  if any  would begin to manifest .",

    "because hh  666 lives in the harsh radiative environment of the carina nebula , it is unclear how much of the relatively low extinction to the driving source reflects protostellar evolution , clearing by the jet , or how much the envelope may have been eroded by external irradiation . nevertheless , the high mass - loss rate of the inner jet ( features hh  666  m and o ) evident from bright h@xmath6 and [ fe  ii ] emission demonstrates that intermediate - mass protostars can continue to accrete at a high rate , albeit sporadically , even as the protostellar envelope is dispersed .",

    "based on this rough estimate , it is natural to ask whether the momentum injection by jets from intermediate - mass protostars competes with the contribution from their more numerous low - mass counterparts . while the velocities we measure in the jets in carina are similar to the velocities measured in jets driven by low - mass protostars ( @xmath36 km s@xmath8 , see figure  [ fig : vhist ] , and * ? ? ?",

    "calculating the momentum flux as @xmath38 , jets from intermediate - mass stars with similar velocities and higher densities therefore have a momentum flux that is @xmath37 times higher for an individual jet .    to estimate whether the total momentum injection from intermediate - mass protostars exceeds that of the more numerous low - mass sources , we must compare the relative numbers of low- and intermediate - mass stars with the relative strengths of the jets they drive . assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath39 we find that @xmath40 m@xmath5 stars outnumber @xmath41 m@xmath5 stars by a factor of @xmath42 , although the number will change depending on the imf used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if each individual intermediate - mass star injects 100 times the momentum of each low mass star , then the cumulative momentum injection rate of intermediate - mass stars is still @xmath43 times that of low - mass stars . in principle",
    "then , intermediate - mass stars may be an important source of momentum injection in massive star forming regions .",
    "however , there are many caveats to consider when interpreting the relative momentum injection of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "this simple estimate does not account for the possibility that the jet mass - loss rate and velocity may be functions of both the protostellar mass and evolutionary stage .",
    "more massive protostars evolve faster than their low - mass counterparts , which means both that their outflows turn on earlier and persist for a shorter period of time",
    ". the early injection of momentum from intermediate - mass stars may be more influential to the star forming environment than the cumulative contribution of low - mass stars later in the evolution of the cloud as a whole .",
    "variability and precession may also affect the momentum transfer efficiency as a recent burst from a precessing jet that impacts fresh gas may transfer more momentum to the environment than a more steady - state jet propagating into a cleared cavity .",
    "all four of the fast , dense jets studied here have high momentum flux , despite apparent differences in the evolutionary stage of their driving sources ( see section  [ ss : ages ] ) .",
    "of the four outflows we observe , hh  666 has the largest dynamical age and lowest obscuration of the driving source ( which can be seen in the h@xmath6 images presented by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that it is the oldest , most evolved source in the sample .",
    "despite this , hh  666 maintains the highest velocities of the four jets measured here , and one of the highest mass - loss rates of all of the jets in carina ( see table  4 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the irradiated jets in carina behave in the same way as their embedded counterparts , then these four jets contradict the @xcite and @xcite conclusion that more evolved sources drive less powerful outflows .",
    "however , the efficiency of momentum transfer to the environment complicates the comparison between the carina jets and the co outflows observed by e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure the co momentum flux near the driving source assuming that the combined momentum flux of the inner jet and `` classical '' co outflow is conserved along the flow direction .",
    "we observe the protostellar jet directly in carina , so it is critically important to understand the efficiency of momentum transfer between the jet and the ambient gas that is swept up in the co outflow .",
    "@xcite find that momentum transfer from jets with a mach number @xmath44 happens primarily at the bow shock . even in the ionized gas of the h  ii region where the sound speed , @xmath45 km s@xmath8 , the mach number of these jets is @xmath46 . in the neutral environment of the dust pillar ,",
    "the mach number for the same outflow speed is even higher .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the momentum transfer to the environment will happen when the jet turns on , or in the case of episodic jets ( see section  [ ss : variability ] ) , each time the jet turns up ( losing mass at a higher rate corresponding to an accretion burst , see * ? ? ?",
    "momentum transfer happening primarily at the bow shock is also consistent with the interpretation that the carina jets can maintain relatively high velocities throughout because subsequent knots travel in the wake of previous ejecta ( see section  [ ss : structure ] ) .",
    "clumps in protostellar jets may result from variations in the initial ejection velocity or changes in the density of the ejected material .",
    "velocity variations in the jet may create knotty structures that move along the flow axis with small ( few 10s of km s@xmath8 ) velocity variations between them reflecting the variation in the ejection velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternately , a jet may show a clumpy morphology but have a smooth velocity structure that suggests changes in the amount of mass lost into the jet at a constant ejection velocity ( as may be the case in hh  666  m , reiter et al . in prep ) .",
    "as @xcite and @xcite have pointed out , larger outbursts evident as bow shocks in protostellar jets may be a way to infer the time between fu orionis outbursts . to first order",
    ", we can estimate the time between separate ejection events by taking the difference in the age of large neighboring clumps . simply taking the age difference of subsequent knots",
    ", the time between ejection events in these jets appears to be on the order of @xmath47 years .",
    "the average time between ejections for all four jets is @xmath48 yr , on the order of the variability time - scale estimated for hh  46/47 @xcite , and the time between ejections found in hh jets driven by low - mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "time variable accretion and outflow will impact many of the parameters we have estimated from these jets .",
    "clumpy structures in the jet suggest that the mass - loss rate in the jet is elevated for short periods of time , spending more time in a quiescent phase , losing mass at a lower rate .",
    "if we assume that the jet is `` on '' ( losing mass at a high rate ) for only a fraction of the jet lifetime of @xmath33 yr , then the total momentum injection from a single intermediate - mass protostar will be reduced compared to what we would estimate assuming the maximum mass - loss rate for the duration of the jet lifetime .",
    "we present new proper motion measurements of four massive hh jets in the carina nebula  hh  666 , hh  901 , hh  902 , and hh  1066 . with a @xmath0 year baseline and assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc",

    "new spectra of hh  901 , hh  902 , and hh  1066 , combined with previously published spectra of hh  666 @xcite , make it possible to measure the tilt angles and 3d space motions of these jets .",
