    "many of the most energetic high - energy astrophysical sources show marked variability on a range of timescales . from short duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) to outbursts from active galaxies ( agn ) it is clear than the high - energy sky varies on timescales from milliseconds to many years .",
    "the extremes of this regime have been probed since the beginnings of x - ray and @xmath2ray astronomy ; grbs were first recognised in the late 1960 s @xcite , and agn were amongst the first identified extragalactic x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "however , probing durations of hours to days has proved to be challenging .",
    "such systems are too rare and fleeting to be picked up by narrow field x - ray telescopes ( which are often used for studies of longer lived events ) while they are also often too faint to trigger wide field rate - based @xmath2ray detectors , which have been the dominant route for mapping the rarest , but brightest events ( such as grbs ) .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite @xcite offers an ideal route to the study of transient events in these time frames .",
    "its wide field covers roughly 1/6th of the sky in a single view of its burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",
    "it can be triggered not only based on the rate of incident photons , but by reconstructing an image based on a long integration , and searching this for sources that would not have triggered a rate - based detector .",
    "indeed , it can produce integrated triggers over timescales of several days , and so long duration transients have been identified both as grb triggers , and via an ongoing transient monitor @xcite .",
    "this is coupled with the rapid x - ray and uv / optical follow - up , meaning that these events , once found , can be localised and detailed multi wavelength follow - up initiated , both from ground and space - based facilities .",
    "remarkably , it has only been in the last few years ( the second half of _ swift _ s lifetime , at the time of writing ) that such populations have begun to be uncovered , perhaps in part because events in the early years may have gone otherwise unrecognised , but also because they are likely intrinsically rare . in this review",
    "i outline _ swift s _ progress in unveiling new populations of transients that emit @xmath2rays over time periods from hours to days .",
    "these duration are orders of magnitude longer than typical grbs , but still much shorter than agn - outbursts .",
    "i concentrate on the most energetic events , whose total energy releases exceed @xmath4 ergs .",
    "these events split broadly into two categories , with durations of @xmath5 and @xmath3 seconds ( see figure  [ pspace ] ) , they may be related , but perhaps more likely represent a diverse set of events with significantly different progenitors . for each class of transient",
    "i will discuss the observational characteristics as a class , and proceed to consider the plausible progenitor models .",
    "there is significant overlap between their proposed progenitor systems , which break - down broadly into massive star collapses ( of stars with larger radius than those creating long - grbs ) , and tidal disruption flares .",
    "this in turn suggests that while the progenitors of each class may be distinct , it is possible that both classes of progenitor are present in the observed populations .     versus average luminosity place , from @xcite .",
    "large numbers of long and short duration gamma - ray bursts can be seen , but only a handful of even longer events , lasting @xmath6 s. these two classes , named ulgrbs and tdfs are the subject of this review . , title=\"fig : \" ] -0.05truein    s. a log - normal fit to the _ swift _ distribution from @xcite is shown as the red dashed line .",

    "different durations have been indicated .",
    "the classical @xmath10 is determined by the duration of the @xmath0-ray emission , in this case recorded by bat immediately after the trigger , or in the case of grb 111209a recovered in subsequent orbits .",
    "this clearly misses some engine activity , and so may not be a good diagnostic .",
    "alternatively , @xmath11 defines the total activity , but does nt distinguish between low and high levels , and can have very different values of @xmath12 ( @xmath10 determined within @xmath11).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] -0.05truein",
    "the duration of an outburst is a fundamental parameter in its description .",
    "in addition to providing a useful tool in the classification of a given outburst ( e.g the observed distinction between short- and long duration grbs ( sgrbs and lgrbs ) @xcite ) , the duration of a transient also provides hints on the activity in its central engine @xcite , and has been suggested to provide direct constraints on the size of long - grb progenitors @xcite .",
    "traditionally the duration of a grb is defined as @xmath10 , the time period over which 90% of the total fluence is recorded .",
    "this is a simple and powerful definition , however it suffers from a lack of comparability between instruments which may have different effective passbands ( and bursts may last for different durations at different energies ) and from the sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "a more sensitive instrument will follow the decay of a burst for longer . depending on its light curve",
    "this could include significant additional energy , and hence increase the duration .",
    "indeed , a comparison of the distribution of durations of bursts detected by _ swift _ and _ cgro / batse _ clearly shows that the softer response of _ swift _ tends to omit the typically harder short bursts .",
    "there is also a suggestion that the long bursts it detects have larger @xmath10 values , again likely because of the softer response ( figure  [ durations ] ) .",
    "in addition to the distinction between long- and short - grbs , another feature apparent in the distribution of grb durations ( figure  [ durations ] ) is the appearance of a handful of bursts with durations much longer than the majority of bursts observed . while very long bursts have been identified with durations of @xmath13s by batse , bepposax and konus - wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) they have not been studied in detail , and these events were generally still much shorter than some which have recently been detected by _",
    "swift _ that can be seen in gamma - rays for in excess of 10,000 s  this is the suggested population of ultra - long grbs .",
    "the characteristics of this population are yet to be strongly defined , but it is clear that there is a tail of  normal \" bursts extending to @xmath14s ( see figure  [ durations ] ) , and so durations of @xmath15s or more may be needed to lie clearly in the ultra - long population , we discuss this in more detail in section  [ ulgrb ] . a further population of outbursts has been identified with durations of @xmath3 s , these have been seen either as repeated grb triggers , or via the bat transient monitor .",
    "the durations are so extreme ( @xmath0-ray emission detected for @xmath16s in some cases ) that they clearly represent a separate population of bursts ( and probably a separate progenitor ) to the lgrbs , these very long events , candidate tidal disruption flares , are discussed in more detail in section  [ tde ] .",
    "ultra - long bursts may be difficult to discover since long - lived , but low flux bursts are readily missed .",
    "indeed , the _ swift_-bat normally only records the duration as measured immediately following the trigger in so - called  event \" mode . in the longest bursts",
    "the high - energy @xmath0-rays may continue to be detected in the following orbit , although it seems that with the _ swift_-bat sample this is rare , with only @xmath17 events found in survey data surrounding the burst @xcite .",
    "even of these only a handful exceed durations of 5000 s , and most had been previously identified as candidate ultra - long events based on their prolonged , luminous x - ray emission .",
    "a crucial question is whether , on duration grounds alone , these bursts represent a new population of events to the traditional grbs .",
    "different conclusions have been drawn on this .",
    "@xcite argue that the overall distribution is consistent with underlying duration distribution of long - grbs , which they find to be reasonably fit as a log - normal distribution with a mean of 1.47 ( @xmath18s ) and @xmath19 .",
    "there is clearly limited statistical power at very long durations , where the small sample sizes result in significant counting errors .",
    "however , they note that the number of bursts observed with durations @xmath20 s ( 11 ) , is consistent with expectations of the model ( 9.75 )",
    ". however , in this case we would expect the majority of the longest bursts to be observed closer to this cut ( i.e. with durations of 600 - 1000 s ) , in contrast , the ultra - long population suggested above has durations @xmath21s . this lies @xmath22 from the mean inferred by @xcite , and given the number of bursts observed by _",
    "swift _ we would expect to observe none with @xmath23s , compared with @xmath24 systems observed .",
    "this is shown graphically in figure  [ t90 ] , and may indeed suggest the bursts are a new population .",
    "unsurprisingly , these difficulties in measuring durations have led to several authors investigating alternative tools for duration determination .",
    "of particular importance is the discovery early in the _ swift _ mission that the engines of grbs are active for much longer than the prompt emission time , with a combination of flares and plateaus indicating that in both long and short grbs the engine can be active for many thousands of seconds beyond the end of the @xmath2ray emission @xcite .",
    "motivated by this @xcite have attempted to define an engine lifetime ( @xmath7 ) for many of the bursts detected by _ swift_. this is a difficult task since it requires some decomposition of the afterglow light and prompt emission , both of which are likely to be contributing within a few hundred seconds of the burst . however , the cessation of engine activity is often followed by a rapid drop - off in brightness ( formally more rapid than readily allowed by fireball blast wave models ) . by identifying this time it is possible to place some constraint on the engine activity time for 3/4 of the _ swift _ bursts , although it is only relatively robust in @xmath25 of the bursts .",
    "the resulting distribution is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ durations ] , while the outline of the duration measurement method is shown graphically in figure  [ durations ] .",
    "it is notable in this distribution that the engine activity time is frequently much larger than @xmath10 .",
    "it is also clear that while with the exception of a handful of very long bursts the @xmath10 distribution is well fit by a log - normal distribution , the @xmath7 distribution consists of a much larger tail , that requires an additional component to provide a good fit @xcite .",
    "indeed , a similar approach , with a similar duration distribution is reached by @xcite , who define a duration , @xmath26 to be the last rapid decay in the x - ray lightcurve ( a similar definition to @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite show less agreement over the significance and interpretation of this tail , with @xcite suggesting that an ultra - long population can not be confirmed , while @xcite infer that the ultra - long population is statistically different .",
    "such diagnostics are complex , the long tail is not necessarily representative of a new population since there is no strong physical motivation for the log - normal distribution of durations .",
    "additionally , it should be noted that the rapid fall - off in the @xmath7 distribution occurs at around the _ swift _ orbital period .",
    "given that observations of bursts can not normally continue much beyond the first @xmath14s it is expected that this could result in a pile up of @xmath7 values on either side of this gap @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , that the distributions of @xmath10 and @xmath7 are better explained with the presence of an additional population at larger durations , while being well described around their peak by log - normal distributions is suggestive of a new , additional population . to ascertain if these necessarily imply different progenitor systems it is necessary to turn to the multiwavelength afterglow properties",
    "while there have been several examples of very long bursts over the years , the population as a whole remains poorly defined , and indeed is extremely difficult to define .",
    "however , the arguments above suggest that placing the duration cut towards the long end of the bulk of the grb distribution ( i.e. in the region 500 - 1000 s ) will result in difficulties in isolating clean samples . furthermore , it is the events which last much longer that are clearly distinct , and can not be described with the same log - normal distribution that adequately describes long - grb durations .",
    "therefore , conservatively one could set the ultra - long bursts as those which have @xmath0-ray emission detectable at the sensitivity of current instruments ( integral , fermi - gbm , konus - wind , bat , maxi etc ) of @xmath27s or more .",
    "this results in a small sample of bursts that can be considered , although it may be enlarged somewhat by the ongoing search for further events in bat survey data @xcite , or by the consideration of similar morphological properties in x - ray light curves that might indicate bursts belonging to the same population @xcite .",
    "the events for which detailed mulitwavelength follow - up are available are shown in table  [ sample_ulgrb ] .",
    "they are grbs 101225a , 111209a , 121027a and 130925a .",
    "however , while this route of identification is robust in the sense that it identifies bursts in which the prompt emission has lasted for a very long time , it may also miss other members of this class .",
    "the total fluence measured for the ulgrbs above is similar to that seen in most lgrbs , but spread over a longer time ( @xmath5s versus @xmath28s ) , this means that these bursts are harder to detect in @xmath0-rays , and had they been fainter then they could easily have failed to have the longer lived @xmath0-ray emission detected , even if the brightest emission was sufficient to trigger the detector . additionally , the orbit of _ swift _ and _ fermi _ is such that they can not observed the position of the burst continuously for several thousand seconds . indeed , _",
    "swift _ rapid slewing across the sky means that it spends a few hundred seconds on average at a given position .",
    "these satellites may then miss some of the later time @xmath0-ray emission . in the case of grb 130925a the brightest episodes as recorded by maxi or konus - wind happened at points where",
    "_ swift _ was not observing the source , meaning that even if _ swift _",
    "data is considered over several orbits , it provides a poor view of the total duration of the burst .",
    "therefore it is relevant to consider if other indicators may be used as diagnostics of the ulgrb population",
    ". these might be @xcite    * prolonged x - ray emission ( lasting @xmath5 s or more ) within two orders of magnitude of the peak ( i.e. at the start time of the x - ray observations ) .",
    "* a rapid decay at the end of this period , similar to those interpreted as high - lattitude emission in early grb afterlgows . * variability within the x - ray light curve through this period that is consistent with ongoing prompt emission , but unlikely to have an afterglow origin ( e.g. rapid flaring , and a strong hardness  intensity correlation ) .",
    "many more bursts meet one or more of the criteria above , although if these are truly representative of the ulgrb population is less clear . indeed , the description above is very similar to that used by @xcite to define @xmath7 with the additional criteria that the luminosity of the burst must remain within two orders of magnitude of the peak throughout this duration in order to classify as a ulgrb .",
    "a more quantative approach would be to utilise @xmath7 as a measure of the total engine activity period ( rather than use the total time over which @xmath2rays are detected ) , and then determine @xmath29 as the time over which 90% of the total fluence released during @xmath7 was recorded . in this case",
    "many grbs would still have a short @xmath10 , even though @xmath7 was very long ( e.g. grb 050724 , figure 3 ) , while because ulgrbs remain bright for longer they have a much larger value of @xmath29 .",
    "further investigations into this diagnostic may yield stronger constraints on the possible size of ulgrb population .",
    "the properties of the first ulgrbs to be identified were sufficiently different from those of most grbs that it was initially unclear if they were of cosmological or galactic origin , a debate very similar to that conducted for lgrbs and sgrbs in the early 1990s @xcite . for grb 101225a two",
    "very different models were put forward , the first that of a comet or asteroid being tidally disrupted around a neutron star @xcite , the second the explosion of a supernovae inside a dense envelope ( probably its own common envelope , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the former model indeed bares significant resemblance to a popular model for the creation of galactic grbs @xcite , and has even recently been mooted as a possible origin for fast radio bursts ( frbs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the latter model is a rare variant on binary channels to create lgrbs @xcite , in which the explosion occurs during the common envelope via the merger of a he core with a neutron star . in this model",
    "the afterglow evolution was reasonably fit with a type ic supernova at @xmath30 @xcite    the redshift of grb 101225a proved extremely challenging to derive , since despite a bright afterglow ( see below ) , it was largely featureless , showing no obvious emission or absorption lines .",
    "however , deep , later observations taken with gemini showed a series of faint emission lines at @xmath31 @xcite , resolving the galactic versus cosmological debate , but placing it at a redshift well beyond the model of @xcite .",
    "subsequently redshift measurements have been rather more straightforward for grb 111209a ( @xmath32 from both absorption lines in the afterglow and emission lines from the host ) @xcite , grb 121027a ( z=1.71 from afterglow absorption , @xcite , and host emission @xcite ) and grb 130925a ( @xmath33 from the host galaxy emission lines @xcite ) .",
    "hence the ulgrb population is clearly cosmological , and to date has a rather lower mean redshift ( @xmath34 ) than the lgrb population as a whole ( @xmath35 @xcite ) .",
    "this differing redshift is not surprising since the lower ( on average ) peak fluxes of ulgrbs would naturally result in a more limited horizon .",
    "erg s@xmath36 for hours following the burst , but are still an order of magnitude shorter than the longest events ( the candidate tdes with durations of @xmath37s .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there is one other stellar transient that can achieve similar late time luminosities , the case of the super luminous supernovae scp 06f6 @xcite , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "-0.05truein        the afterglow properties of the ultra - long bursts form a varied set of properties , but are frequently rather different than those observed in the majority of long - grbs . in the case of grb 101225a ,",
    "the early optical - uv light curve is exceptionally blue , and can not be well fit by fireball models that work well in other bursts @xcite .",
    "in addition to this it shows marked chromatic evolution from blue to red over the course of the next few days , again different from the largely achromatic evolution of afterglow light curves .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the evolution of the low - luminosity , also very long grb 060218 @xcite , that is commonly explained as due to shock breakout during a supernova .",
    "the afterglow of grb 130925a is highly extinguished by dust within its host galaxy , with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it can be spectrally well fit with an absorbed broken power - law , without strong evidence of spectral evolution , however the results do not appear consistent with other afterglows , and indicate the the x - rays and optical light may be originating from different locations ( unlike most grbs where both should arise from the forward shock at late times ) .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of the optical and ir observations of of grb 130925a is that because of its extreme duration , optical and ir observations with grond were possible while the @xmath0-ray emission was ongoing .",
    "these observations appear to show the ir light curve with essentially the same structure as seen at higher energies , but with a lag of 300 - 400 s @xcite . while rather different from grb 101225a , this afterglow also therefore appears highly atypical .",
    "the afterglows of grbs 111209a and 121027a on the other hand appear to have little extinction , and are well described as power - laws with indicies comparable of those found in most long - grbs , although detailed afterglow modelling has yet to be attempted , and it is possible that the luminous x - ray emission will pose problems for combined models in these cases as well .",
    "all of the ulgrbs drive long - lived and luminous x - ray emission ( see figure  [ lc_comp ] for a comparison of ulgrb x - ray light curves to other events ) . at x - ray wavelengths",
    "the distinction between prompt and afterglow emission is not necessarily clear .",
    "however , throughout the period before the rapid x - ray decay , the ongoing flaring , and apparent hardness  intensity correlation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with the x - ray emission dominated by the prompt component . in this case",
    "the x - ray afterglows should begin to dominate only after this decline . at this point",
    "the luminosity of the afterglows is mixed . in the case of grb 101225a",
    "few x - ray s were observed after the rapid decline @xcite . for grbs 111209a and 121027a , as with the optical a rather typical afterglow was observed @xcite , while in the case of grb 130925a the late time x - rays show strong chromatic evolution .",
    "this has been interpreted by @xcite as an afterglow which is almost absent , but with a major contribution from dust scattered light of the earlier x - ray emission . however , in this case one would expect very little higher energy emission , in contrast to the detection of an underlying hard component by nustar @xcite that strongly implies a significant afterglow component . however , the standard absorbed single power - law that provide a good description of most _ swift _ x - ray observations fail to provide a good description of the data .",
    "these models can work through the nustar regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or can include additional hard power - law components as sometimes seen by _",
    "fermi_-lat @xcite . in the case of grb 130925a",
    "the combined spectrum actually requires some additional softer component ( absorption , thermal emission ) , whose variation compared to the power - law is probably responsible for the apparent spectral changes seen in the _ swift_-xrt observations .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the multi wavelength data obtained by @xcite , who also find a good fit with a thermal + power law model while also providing a fuller modelling of the afterglow .",
    "although the intensive work on the afterglow of grb 130925a offers rather disparate interpretations , a common theme of these models is that the x - ray afterglow itself is relatively weak , and consistent with being driven into a low density environment .",
    "such detailed observations are not available for other events , but the absence of the x - ray afterglow in grb 101225a would also support such a model .",
    "a consistently low density surrounding ulgrbs would provide potentially valuable constraints on their progenitors .",
    "the host galaxies of the ulgrb population are all star forming galaxies , with detected emission lines . in the case of the first two examples ( grbs 101225a and grb 111209a ) the host galaxies were apparently extremely compact and of low luminosity ( with m@xmath39 -16.2 and -17.5 for 101225a and 111209a respectively @xcite ) .",
    "these properties were consistent with an origin in blue compact dwarfs , with likely low metallicity , and such galaxies are rare , even amongst the grb host population . in turn",
    "this was taken as some evidence for a distinction between the ulgrbs and the normal lgrb population .",
    "however , the hosts of grb 121027a and grb 130925a are rather brighter systems .    a further important",
    "diagnostic is the location of the events within the host galaxies .",
    "long - grbs are highly concentrated on their host light ( much more so than normal core collapse sne , @xcite ) , while short - grbs are highly scattered at large offsets @xcite .",
    "again , the first two examples of ulgrbs showed an apparent origin consistent with the nuclei of their hosts , perhaps indicative of an origin with the black hole that may reside there .",
    "however , these small galaxies also contain a significant fraction of their total light within the brightest pixel of their hosts ( since they are compact ) , and so the probability of association with this location should they follow a distribution similar to grbs is significant . indeed ,",
    "the case of grb 130925a clearly shows that not all events are nuclear , with _",
    "hst _ imaging clearly demonstrating an non - nuclear origin @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the galaxy also shows signs of recent merger activity , and so may harbour more than one massive black hole .",
    "three out of the four well studied ulgrbs lie at redshift where supernovae could be visible should they be similar to those seen in normal lgrbs @xcite .",
    "notionally , this should be most straightforward in the case of grb 130925a , whose redshift @xmath40 is almost identical to the case of grb 130427a , whose sne was readily identified @xcite .",
    "however , the burst afterglow was apparently highly extinguished @xcite , and only seen in the near - ir , where detailed follow - up was more difficult . to date there is no clear evidence for an sne in this case .",
    "this leaves the cases of grb 101225a and 111209a .",
    "both of these events show strong uv emission , and little evidence for significant host extinction . despite their higher redshifts they are promising routes to searching for associated sne , as deep , late - time multicolour observations were taken in each case @xcite . in both cases",
    "there is spectral evolution , with a change from blue @xmath41 red",
    ". this could well be the hallmark of supernovae emission .",
    "grb afterglows are typically described as power laws ( modified by host extinction , or the unusual possibility of a spectral break in the range of interest ) , in contrast sne exhibit strong metal line blanketing short ward of @xmath42   in the rest - frame .",
    "hence the emergence of an associated sne should provide a measurable reddening , and may well reverse the decay at rest - frame optical wavelengths where the sne peaks .",
    "however , while the first order properties seen in grb 101225a and grb 111209a appear to support this model , they differ in the details .",
    "in particular , the counterparts remain too blue to be well described by a supernovae similar to the sn  1998bw models that provide such a good fit to most lgrbs ( see figures  [ sed_evolve ] ) and spectroscopy taken of grb 111209a at the time of expected sne peak fails to show any obvious sne features ( figure  [ grism ] ) .    ) . in broad terms",

    ". this could be due to a larger contribution from the host galaxy , because the sne type is different ( for example the flatness in this spectral regime may be due to enhanced emission around 6500from a broad h@xmath43 in a sn ii ) , or because there is no sne in this ulgrb .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -0.05truein    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the concept of a tidal disruption flare has long been discussed , and is an inevitable consequence of the presence of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei .",
    "the disruption occurs when a star approaches a black hole sufficiently closely that the gravitational pull on its outer layers from the black hole exceeds that from the star itself . at this point",
    "the star can disrupt either completely , or partly ( e.g. by stripping of the outer layers of the star ) . in a complete disruption half of the star",
    "is placed onto eccentric bound orbits and will return to form a disc and ultimately accrete onto the black hole , the other half is unbound .",
    "the accreting material is shock heated to high temperatures peaking in the extreme - uv or soft x - ray regimes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it has been difficult to rule out alternative explanations , such as unusual nuclear supernovae in many cases .",
    "however , more recently it was suggested that in addition to this thermal emission a small fraction of the material may be expelled at relativistic velocities @xcite .",
    "such material would create a new route to identifying tdfs , and was originally considered in the context of next generation radio surveys , which could uncover the events at late times when the blast wave was approximately spherical .",
    "these extremely long transients provide a natural match to the expectations of this model .",
    "there is direct evidence from the radio observations for relativistic motion , while the super - eddington accretion rates observed at early times might suggest an even narrower beam ( the early luminosity exceeds the eddington limit for the black holes within these host galaxies by a factor of @xmath44 ) .",
    "all of the events are consistent with the nuclei of relatively low mass galaxies , and with black holes with @xmath45 m@xmath46 ( see below ) , consistent with the disruption of main sequence stars occurring outside the event horizon . given the theoretical prediction of these events prior to their detection , their long - lived , high luminous emission , and their locations within host galaxies this model provides an extremely good fit to the observations , and is adopted as the consensus view for the origin of these outbursts .",
    "however , it is not a unique model , and other alternative has been put forward as well .",
    "if these events are interpreted as tdfs then various routes have been proposed to measure the black hole masses within them . the most straightforward route (",
    "though potentially with the largest scatter ) is to utilise the well known relationship between bulge - mass and black hole - mass in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the total stellar mass of the galaxies can be estimated from rest - frame ir observations , and then used to infer a black hole mass . in each case , the masses of the black holes obtained via this route are @xmath47 m@xmath46 .    alternatively , one can use timing arguments to infer the mass of the black hole .",
    "the rapid variability of _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 5734 implies that any temporally connected source by at must be smaller than the schwarschild radius of a @xmath48 m@xmath46 bh @xcite , providing a relatively robust upper limit to the black hole mass . alternatively , a rather more complex approach can utilise known relations between radio and x - ray luminosity , that apparently links stellar and supermassive black holes .",
    "this route infers are rather small intermediate mass black hole @xmath49 m@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been suggested that the rapid switch off seen in both _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 5734 @xcite and _ swift _ j2058",
    "+ 0516 @xcite might be due to the source reaching its eddington limit .",
    "this has some appeal , since at this point it would no longer be necessary for the source to be beamed in order to drive its luminosity against inflating material . in this case",
    ", the luminosity at the break would be indicative of the the eddington limit for that mass of black hole , providing a route to measuring the mass .",
    "a conservative approach would be to assume that the eddington limit lies somewhere between the pre- and post - drop luminosity , although the drops are so steep that this only provides a black hole mass limit in the range @xmath50 m@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "all of these mass estimates contain considerably uncertainty , and rely either on the extrapolation of known relations significantly beyond the regions in which they have been tested ( e.g. the @xmath51 relation , or the variability fundamental plane ) , or on hitherto untested relations ( i.e. that the jet switch - off occurs at the eddington limit ) .",
    "however , it is encouraging that all of these routes yield masses of @xmath52 m@xmath46 for all three events , meaning that they are consistent with the expectations of main sequence stars being shredded by black holes , comparable in mass to those that we know exist within the local universe .",
    "the early light curve of _ swift _ j1644 +",
    "5734 is punctuated by a series of extremely rapid flares , during which the luminosity jumps by orders of magnitude on a timescale of only a few hundred seconds .",
    "these flares , repeat on timescales of around 30,000 s ( although it should be stressed that they are not strictly periodic ) and have a marked similarity flare to flare .",
    "these timescales are perhaps surprising for a main sequence disruption , since they are much shorter than the orbital period of the disrupting star , and therefore consecutive passages of the star ( with further disruption ) can not be explanation for the origin of the flares . as an alternative",
    ", it has been proposed that _ swift _ j1644 +",
    "5734 is due to a white - dwarf disrupted by a imbh @xcite , an interestingly similar model to those subsequently proposed by some authors to explain the ulgrbs @xcite .",
    "the appeal of this model lies in the natural interpretation of the flare structure .",
    "however , interpreting this structure is challenging as it likely based on the beamed x - ray emission , and so its direct correlation to the @xmath53 onto the black hole is less clear .",
    "furthermore , while most models would predict that there is relatively smooth return of material from the disrupted star back to the black hole , this may well not be the case at the point of return of the most bound debris ( i.e. the material that first accretes ) , which could fragment or accrete in sporadic bursts , even from a main sequence star .",
    "_ swift _ j1644 + 5734 was first discovered as a grb , and its long - lived emission was subsequently interpreted as being related to a massive star collapse @xcite .",
    "more detailed models have subsequently been derived by woosley & heger @xcite , who demonstrate various means by which long - lived transients can arise from collapsar - like events , including single massive stars , tidally locked binaries , and pair instability collapse .",
    "interestingly , these models predict a rapid switch - off in the in accretion rate , essentially when all of the star has been accreted .",
    "this may mirror the switch - off s seen in the events to date , and it is striking that this prediction was made prior to their discovery ( see figure  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , further support that core collapse events can reach such high luminosities comes from x - ray observations of the super luminous supernovae scp 06f6 , that reached @xmath54 erg s@xmath55 , 150 days after its initial outburst @xcite    however , the locations of the bursts are problematic for massive star collapse models .",
    "even grbs , that are highly concentrated on their host like only lie coincident with the nucleus of their hosts @xmath56 of the time @xcite .",
    "given this the probability of 3 events having such a location is @xmath57% , apparently ruling out the possibility of a grb - like origin at @xmath58 .",
    "however , it should be noted that this conclusion is currently only robust in two cases , and deep _ hst _ observations of _ swift _ j1112 - 8238 are hence crucial to this conclusion .",
    "-0.05truein      while the origin of the ulgrbs remains an open question , it seems likely ( if not yet conclusive ) that the longest events are due to the tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes .",
    "these systems are apparently much rarer ( in terms of volumetric rate ) than  classical \" , non - relativistic tidal flares , which are expected at rates of @xmath59 yr@xmath36 galaxy@xmath36 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is likely because of either the narrowness of the beamed emission ( so that only a small fraction are seen ) or because of the rarity of jets ( because few systems launch relativistic jets in the first instance ) .",
    "crucial questions therefore arise in the role of these events as probes of jet formation , launching an ubiquity around massive black holes .",
    "the tidal flares are unusual because they provide the opportunity to witness accretion around a supermassive black hole from its start to finish over the timescale of only a few years , therefore providing new constraints about how accretion behaves in a range of regimes .    furthermore , since these events may be visible either to x - ray or radio searches to much larger distances than non - relativistic tdfs , it is possible that they may come to dominate the number of systems observed .",
    "if a route can be found to translate their observations into black holes masses this provides the ability to track changes in the black hole mass function through ongoing accretion and heirarchical mergers over most of cosmic history .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that merging black holes may raise the tidal disruption rate by 4 orders of magnitude ( to one per 10 years or so ) , in which case their discovery might provide a route of identifying close merger black hole pairs of interest to low frequency gravitational wave detectors ( e.g. elisa ) ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    ".    finally , the strong particle acceleration in the jets of relativistic tidal disruption flares are promising sites for the acceleration of ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "since their are insufficient bright agn within the local horizon through which the rays can propagate , and grbs appear to be insufficient to provide this acceleration @xcite , it is possible that the tidal flares could provide the solution , although further studies of the details of shock acceleration , and tidal flare rate are clearly necessary to firm this conclusion up @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that highly energetic transient events ( @xmath60 erg ) with durations from hours to days apparently exist , but have been undetected by a fleet of both pointed and survey @xmath2 and x - ray telescopes over the past 5 decades .",
    "they have evaded detection by a combination of rarity ( hence they have not been found serendipitously in the narrow field of view of x - ray telescopes ) and low peak - flux ( so they havent , in general , been identified by rate based @xmath0-ray detectors ) .",
    "these events are only now uncovered in sufficient numbers to identify new populations of outburst , thanks to the ability of _ swift _ to both locate them , but also rapidly highlight their interest to the community in a timely way . however , these new populations are a recent development , and our knowledge and understanding is much less mature than for the lgrbs and sgrbs , whose origin and physics have been hotly discussed for several decades .",
    "future observations will continue to build on our knowledge of these populations , and address several central questions , including .",
    "* are ulgrbs are separate class , spawned from giant stars , or wd - imbh disruptions , or do they form the tail end of the lgrb distribution ? * can a larger sample of candidate relativistic tdfs confirm that they are all related to tidal flares , and not other possible progenitors ? *",
    "how large are the true volumetric rates of the systems ? * what are their roles as probes of both cosmology ( pop iii - like ulgrbs , ubiquity of black holes in galaxies ) and of extreme physics ( can their engines explain the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ? what do their engines tell us about jet - formation in agn ? ) .",
    "the study of these extreme , but still mysterious transients remains an open question in astrophysics , it will be at the forefront of work as _ swift _ enters its second decade of operations .",
