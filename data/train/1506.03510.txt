    "observations and modeling of transitional disks have pointed to an apparent lack of gas relative to their dust content , particularly at larger distances from the star .",
    "early observations ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) show that the co emission are much lower than expected from dust emission and molecular cloud composition . a recent herschel /",
    "pacs survey finds that transitional disks have weaker o  i 63  @xmath2 m emission than their full disk counterparts , even if they have similar continuum at 63  @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "one interpretation of this is that the gas mass is reduced , or , equivalently in effect , that the transitional disks are less flared than their full disk counterpart @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that with a normal gas - to - dust ratio , models of the o  i 63  @xmath2 m emission for disks in taurus tend to over - predict the line intensity .",
    "similarly , detailed modeling of the prototypical transitional disk , tw  hya , suggest a small gas mass ( 0.55)@xmath3  @xmath4 ( and small gas - to - dust mass ratio ) @xcite .",
    "however , the gas mass in these studies are only inferred rather than directly measured .",
    "the main constituent of the gas is hydrogen , mostly in molecular form , followed by helium , both of which defy direct detection in the bulk of the disk , because their line excitation requires high temperature .",
    "so the gas mass is inferred from other agents , such as the commonly used co lines or dust continuum , in combination with radiative transfer and thermo - chemical models .",
    "fortunately , with herschel , it is possible to measure the gas mass in a much more direct way , by observing the rotational transition lines of hd , an isotopologue of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the translation of hd intensity to mass is more straightforward because there is no complex chemistry involved ( though the result depends on the temperature structure ) .",
    "direct measurement of the gas mass of tw  hya based on herschel observation of hd lines gives mass @xmath10.05  @xmath4 @xcite , much higher than the values in some of the previous studies .",
    "to reconcile the two classes of seemingly disparate results on the gas mass of tw  hya , here we show that it is _ not _ the overall gas mass  the mass of atomic and molecular hydrogen  that is reduced , but rather it is the mass of the ice - forming species , such as co and h@xmath5o , are reduced in the upper layers of the outer disk .",
    "it is these upper layers that are emissive and detectable by astronomical observations .",
    "the depletion of co relative to hydrogen in dm  tau and gg  tau has been found by @xcite based on excitation arguments , and in tw  hya by @xcite based on direct comparison of the co isotopologue emission with the hd result .",
    "reduction of the water content has been suggested by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * supporting material ) .",
    "since co and h@xmath5o are the main bearers of carbon and oxygen in the upper layers ( below the photodissociated layer ) , the total abundances of elemental carbon and oxygen are lowered .",
    "this affect other species chemically linked to them .",
    "we also establish that this effect is evident only in the outer disk ( beyond the water and co snow line ) , while in the inner disk the opposite  namely enhancement of the oxygen and carbon abundances  might be taking place . a possible physical mechanism based on dust grain settling and migration",
    "is provided at the end .",
    "we run two models for tw  hya using a thermo - chemical and radiative - transfer code @xcite .",
    "the system is evolved for 1  myr .",
    "both models assume a disk with total gas mass 0.05  @xmath4 as constrained by the hd rotational lines @xcite , a distance of 51  pc @xcite , and an inclination angle of 7  degree @xcite .",
    "the dust mass is not very well constrained , so we use a uniform gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 for both models .",
    "we assume three components for the disk structure : an optically thin component inside @xmath63.5  au , a component tapering at @xmath650  au @xcite , and a component extended to @xmath6200  au .",
    "the mass ratio of the three components are @xmath7 .",
    "the outer two components have a surface density profile @xmath8 .",
    "the disk 3-d density and temperature structure are determined based on vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , calculated through iterative monte carlo simulation of dust radiative transfer , which also yields a spectral energy distribution that matches observation .",
    "the resulting 870  @xmath2 m continuum map of tw  hya resembles the observed one of @xcite , though we spend no effort to match the visibility profile .",
    "the distribution of gas density and temperature is shown in panel ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figntoc ] .",
    "the only difference between the two models lies in the abundances of oxygen and carbon ( relative to hydrogen ) .",
    "the first model has canonical `` low - metal '' ism ( interstellar medium ) oxygen and carbon abundances @xcite in the whole disk , while the second model has reduced oxygen and carbon abundances in the upper layers of the outer disk , and enhanced oxygen and carbon abundances in the inner disk ( see panel ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ figntoc ] ) .",
    "the degree of reduction for oxygen and carbon are based on an analytical prescription , the exact form of which is manually adjusted for a best fit .",
    "carbon is less reduced than oxygen in the outer disk , inspired by the difference in the evaporation temperatures @xcite of water and the major bearers of carbon ( co and co@xmath5 ) .",
    "the enhancement in the inner disk is simply implemented with a step function .",
    "this empirical approach is particularly tailored to match the observational data .",
    "future self - consistent study is needed .",
    "the code predict intensities for a suite of transitions of different species , including c  ii , o  i , h@xmath5o , hd , and the co isotopologues , which have been detected by observation .",
    "the resulting line intensities from the two models are compared with the observed values in fig .",
    "[ figcmp ] ( for the numerical values see table  [ tabcmp ] ) . in agreement with previous studies",
    "@xcite , the model without elemental depletion consistently over - predicts the line intensities of co , water , and a few other species for tw  hya , while the model with depleted oxygen and carbon abundances matches the observational data .",
    "there are a few lines that most clearly require oxygen and carbon to be depleted in the atmosphere of the outer disk , including the o  i 63  @xmath2 m , the co and c@xmath9o low-@xmath10 lines , and all the water ground state lines .        [",
    "cols=\"<,<,>,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         in both models , the water @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 lines originate from @xmath120  au , well beyond the water snow line .",
    "gas phase water molecules in this region are mainly produced through photodesorption of water ice @xcite , with their rates established by experiment @xcite .",
    "a normal oxygen abundance in the outer disk over - predicts their intensities by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the situation is similar for the co and c@xmath9o low-@xmath10 lines ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the o  i and c  ii lines mainly originate from near the water snow line at @xmath14  au in the model with reduced oxygen and carbon abundances , coincident with where the water infrared lines originate @xcite . with normal oxygen and carbon abundances , additional contribution to",
    "the emission arises in gas out to 10  20  au , which make them too strong , by a factor of 5 in the case of o  i. we note that a deficit of elemental carbon in the disk atmosphere has been suggested for the herbig be star hd  100546 by @xcite .    in the model with elemental depletion , we let the carbon and oxygen abundances gradually return to normal when approaching the co snow line ( @xmath620  au ) from outside .",
    "this is required to account for the observed high-@xmath10 and rovibrational co lines , as well as o  i and the numerous mid - infrared transitions of water vapor ( see fig .  [ figfith2ooh ] ) .",
    "this scenario resonates with the recent result on the co/ ratio , which is @xmath15 very close to the star in rw aurigae  a @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath16co @xmath17 and co @xmath17 and @xmath18 transitions , canonical carbon and oxygen abundances in the inner disk of the depleted model are not enough to reproduce the data ; these three lines are under - predicted by about one order of magnitude . along our line of reasoning , one intriguing possibility is that the carbon and oxygen abundances are enhanced @xcite , rather than reduced , in the inner disk .",
    "in fact , if we increase the abundance of carbon and oxygen by a factor of 10 over the ism value within @xmath615  au ( see the insets in panel ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .  [ figntoc ] ) , the co @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the @xmath16co @xmath17 lines would be in good agreement with observations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcmp ] , while still keeping other lines consistent with observations .",
    "inward migration and evaporation of icy bodies is predicted to cause such an enhancement of co and water vapor in the inner disk @xcite .    in the above we",
    "have assumed that only oxygen and carbon are differentially depleted in the outer disk atmosphere , and have left nitrogen intact .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , considering that solar system ices as traced by comets are well known to be nitrogen - poor @xcite",
    ". one interesting outcome of this assumption is that by depleting oxygen ( and carbon , but to a lower degree ) over nearly the entire disk the gas will become rich in carbon ( particularly inside the co snow line ) and nitrogen - bearing molecules . as an example , fig .",
    "[ figcmpcnh ] shows that the column densities of species containing c - n , c - h , and n - h bonds can be increased by up to two orders of magnitude in the depleted model .",
    "this is in line with the recent results on the enhanced abundances of c@xmath5h and cn in evolved protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "depletion of carbon and oxygen in the outer disk also affect the hd emission .",
    "this is because the cooling efficiency due to species bearing these two elements are changed , so that the temperature in the outer disk becomes higher , leading to a stronger hd emission .",
    "for example , 80% of the hd 112  @xmath2 m emission comes from within 80  au in the model with no depletion , while with depletion 60% arises within the same radius ( i.e. the outer disk contributes more ) .",
    "though , as pointed out by @xcite , the energy balance calculation could be subject to considerable uncertainty in the tenuous regions .",
    "the depletion of oxygen and carbon relative to hydrogen solves the puzzle regarding the gas mass of the tw  hya disk . the only known gas - loss mechanism that preferentially removes species containing oxygen and/or carbon (",
    "mainly h@xmath5o and co ) rather than atomic or molecular hydrogen is ice mantle formation on dust grains .",
    "we emphasize that ice mantle formation and grain surface chemical reactions by themselves do not reduce the local elemental abundances ( gas + ice ) in the atmosphere .",
    "@xcite find that co can be transformed into other species such as and on the dust grain surfaces ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , what we find is that if the ice - coated grains stay in the upper atmosphere , desorption and dissociation by uv photons will release , o , oh , co , etc .  to the gas phase , and the emission from them will be much stronger than observations .",
    "the key point is that , the dust grains also grow through coagulation , and as they grow , they settle to the disk midplane @xcite , where they continue to grow bigger and get assembled into planetesimals that may eventually grow to tens of kilometers in size @xcite , possibly accompanied by inward drift @xcite .",
    "the majority of the oxygen and carbon originally frozen onto the dust grains in the atmosphere thus ends up inside solid bodies in the midplane of the disk @xcite .    a reverse process to dust settling described above",
    "must also be considered .",
    "dust grains in the upper layers can be replenished @xcite by the midplane reservoir through turbulent diffusion .",
    "tw  hya has relatively weak turbulence @xcite , which yields a ratio between the scale heights of dust grains and gas of the order of 0.1 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the scale height of oxygen and carbon elements found in the present work .",
    "@xcite find that the inward migration of dust grains combined with gas drag produces a sharp edge in the dust distribution .",
    "what we add to this picture is that , the inward migration ( together with growth and vertical settling ) of dust grains also removes species such as co and from the outer disk atmosphere , though emission of the leftover of these species that remain in the outer region can still be significant .",
    "the dust grains will eventually fall into the central star ( may get disintegrated on its way to the star ) , or become part of a planetesimal , depending on whether they can overcome the fragmentation barrier @xcite to grow large , and whether they can pass the radial drift barrier to avoid falling into the star .",
    "it is a theoretical challenge to bypass the two barriers to maintain enough dust material in the disk to form planets .",
    "empirically , there is evidence for the early presence of large planetesimals for our solar system from cosmochemical record of rocks .",
    "it is known that parental bodies ( @xmath150  km ) of meteorites had already begun to form within a million years of the condensation of calcium - aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) @xcite , and cais are generally considered the oldest bodies of the solar system @xcite .",
    "if systems such as tw  hya are similar to the solar system , then their planetesimals formed at an early stage will be rich in carbon- and oxygen - bearing ices ."
