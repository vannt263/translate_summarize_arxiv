    "the suppression of @xmath0 due to color - screening effects in the medium was initially proposed as a direct evidence of the qgp formation  @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the @xmath0 suppression is still a challenge due to the contributions from the regenerated @xmath0 by the recombination of @xmath11 pairs in the medium and the cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "therefore it is important to have more precise @xmath0 measurements over a broad kinematic range and even cleaner @xmath1 state measurements .",
    "the latter do not suffer from the regeneration contribution due to the much smaller @xmath12 pair cross section , i.e. @xmath13  @xmath14b  @xcite while @xmath15  @xmath14b  @xcite at top rhic energy . the newly installed muon telescope detector ( mtd ) , which provides both the di - muon trigger and the muon identification capability at mid - rapidity , opens the door to measuring quarkonia via the di - muon decay channel at star . compared to the di - electron decay channel , the di - muon decay channel suffers much less from bremsstrahlung and thus provides much better invariant mass resolution to separate different @xmath1 states . using the mtd di - muon trigger , the star experiment recorded data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 28.3  @xmath16 in p@xmath2p collisions at @xmath3  gev in the rhic 2013 run , and 14.2  @xmath17 in au@xmath2au collisions at @xmath6  gev in the rhic 2014 run . in these proceedings , we report ( 1 ) the measurements of @xmath0 production in p+p collisions at @xmath3  gev ; and ( 2 ) the measurements of the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath7 ) for @xmath0 and the production of different @xmath1 states in au+au collisions at @xmath6  gev .",
