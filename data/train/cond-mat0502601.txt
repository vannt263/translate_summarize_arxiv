    "an important question posed by the study of high temperature superconductors is whether the superconducting ground state of doped mott insulators can be described by a bcs - like wave function .",
    "a @xmath1-wave bcs wave function and/or its derivatives have been widely used in the phenomenology of high temperature superconductors , partly because electron pairing , as evidenced by @xmath2 flux quantization and similar experimental results , is observed in the cuprate superconductors . however , owing to the effect of strong on - site coulomb repulsion between the electrons , superconductivity in these systems may be quite different . whereas in a conventional bcs superconductor , screening and retardation effects serve to minimize the role of coulomb interaction , the role of the latter becomes crucial in a doped mott insulator where the charge degrees of freedom are partially frozen by the severity of the coulomb interaction .",
    "strong arguments have been presented in the literature that a high temperature superconductor evolves from a mott insulator doped by holes , and consequently the ground state can be very different from a conventional bcs state @xcite .",
    "a simple step towards incorporating mott physics into a bcs description was suggested many years ago @xcite .",
    "this involves a projection ( out of the hilbert space ) of doubly occupied sites in a @xmath1-wave bcs state @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the charge degrees of freedom on a lattice site @xmath3 , are partially frozen by a gutzwiller operator @xmath4 . at half filling , only spin degrees of freedom survive , and the wave function describes a mott insulating state .",
    "this class of wave functions has achieved some success in the phenomenology of the cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "a recent paper argues the case further @xcite .",
    "however , the treatment of low energy spin degrees of freedom in this description is not satisfactory .",
    "experimentally , strong antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations have been observed for the cu spins , but projected @xmath1-wave bcs states can not account correctly for such correlations . since we opine that spin correlations are intimately related to superconductivity in a doped mott insulator , we are motivated to seek an alternate description in which the spin degrees of freedom can be treated more accurately and systematically .    in this paper , we propose a new class of ground states based on a microscopic treatment of the @xmath0 model .",
    "these ground state wave functions are different from the projected bcs wave functions , and possess the following properties : ( i ) the spin degrees of freedom can fully restore the af long range order ( aflro ) as well as low - lying spin wave excitations at half filling , and evolve into a spin liquid with strong short - range af correlations at low doping ; ( ii ) the no double occupancy constraint is always satisfied for any doping , and is incorporated self - consistently instead of being enforced by a brute - force  projection ; ( iii ) there is an inherent @xmath1-wave superconducting instability at finite doping .",
    "thus , these wave functions offer a unified description of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in a doped mott insulator .    to motivate the form of the ground state wave function , let us first consider the ground state of the undoped mott insulator on a square lattice .",
    "it is well known that the dynamics of the low energy degrees of freedom in this case are described by the @xmath5 heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "while the exact ground state of this model is not known , a comparison with numerical results shows that the best variational state , @xmath6 , is given by @xcite @xmath7the ground state ( [ lda ] ) is defined to be the bosonic rvb state of the insulator @xcite . here , @xmath8 stands for a singlet spin pairing between opposite sublattice sites @xmath3 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , the positive weight factor associated with it .",
    "the motivation for such a construction is to ensure that the ground state satisfies the so - called marshall sign rule @xcite .",
    "marshall showed that the ground state of the @xmath5 heisenberg hamiltonian on a square lattice satisfies the condition , @xmath11 = ( -1)^{p(\\sigma _ { 1},\\sigma _ { 2}, ... ,\\sigma _ { n})}$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath12 denotes , say , the number of down spins on sublattice @xmath13 for the spin configuration @xmath14 .",
    "then , the matrix elements of the heisenberg hamiltonian are negative and the ground state energy assumes the form of a sum over negative terms @xcite . since each singlet bond @xmath8 satisfies the marshall sign , it follows that the wave function of ( [ lda ] ) , which is given by @xmath15 [ here @xmath3(@xmath9 ) stands for up ( down ) spin sites and @xmath16 if @xmath17 the same sublattice sites ] , always satisfies this criterion .    the ground state ( [ lda ] ) describes both short - range and long - range af correlations very accurately as the best variational wave function for the insulator .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect that any putative rvb state , away from half filling , evolves from ( [ lda ] ) . with this in mind , we ask how the wave function ( [ lda ] ) is modified in the presence of holes . as discussed above , singlet pairing is characterized in the wave function ( lda ) by the marshall sign .",
    "it can be shown that the marshall sign would be still obeyed if doped holes remain static .",
    "then , from the form of ( [ lda ] ) , one may easily see that the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping of holes , which displaces spins as backflow , generally leads to disordering of the marshall sign @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , a hole moving along a closed path picks up a generalized berry s phase , which was first identified by one of us and co - authors@xcite .",
    "this effect , described ( and called ) as a phase string is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is a singular effect and can not be repaired by low energy ( transverse ) spin excitations @xcite .    , known as a phase string , during an operation as a hole moves through a closed path and back to the origin with the displaced spin configurations being restored .",
    "this irreparable phase string effect has been shown to be a general consequence of the @xmath0 model weng_97 .",
    "( b ) the @xmath19 or @xmath20 sign in a phase string is determined by the exchange of the hole with an @xmath21 or @xmath22 spin on the path , which can be viewed as an entanglement between the hole and a spin , illustrated by two entangled loops as both the hole and a displaced spin should return to their origins after the operation . ]",
    "it follows that a _ bare _ hole created in the rvb background ( [ lda ] ) can not possibly describe a low - energy state , and must be dressed by the nonlocal phase string effect . since the phase string effect describes a mutual entanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom illustrated in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the rvb background must also respond nonlocally .",
    "one may thus surmise that low - energy charge degrees of freedom are created by @xmath23 , instead of by the bare @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a nonlocal operator describing the phase string effect .",
    "we call a hole that is created by @xmath26 a twisted hole , and as will be shown in this paper , such a twisted hole is a bosonic object whose kinetic energy is optimized in the ( modified ) rvb background",
    ". we shall obtain a ground state of the following form@xmath27where @xmath28 describes the wave function of the twisted hole @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the total number of holes .",
    "the modified rvb vacuum @xmath31 has the same structure as @xmath6 at half - filling , except that the rvb pairing amplitudes , @xmath32 s , become complex and change continuously with doping , which can be determined self - consistently as we shall show .",
    "the ground state ( [ gswf ] ) is one of the central results of this paper .",
    "it generalizes the wave function ( 1 ) written down by liang _",
    "et al . _ , to the doped case . we will derive ( [ gswf ] ) from a microscopic treatment of the @xmath0 model , based on a reformulation of the model in the so - called phase string representation .",
    "the wave function ( [ gswf ] ) differs from the gutzwiller projected bcs wave functions in a fundamental way .",
    "spin correlations with various length scales emerge self - consistently as a function of doping in @xmath33 and their interplay with the charge degrees of freedom is incorporated through the nonlocal phase string operator @xmath34 in @xmath26 .",
    "we will find that the ground state ( [ gswf ] ) describes both an af insulator ( at zero doping ) and a pseudogap phase with short range af correlations ( at finite doping ) in which two distinct kinds of spin excitations emerge .",
    "we will identify a hidden odlro in this pseudogap ground state which ensures a finite pairing amplitude and nodal fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "although superconducting phase coherence of this state is prevented by the presence of free spins which behave like vortices , there exists an inherent superconducting instability at finite doping , which can naturally give rise to @xmath1-wave superconductivity .    the outline of the paper follows . in section",
    "ii , we reformulate the @xmath0 model using the phase string representation .",
    "this is an exact reformulation and allows us to sort out the effects of hole motion in an af background discussed earlier .",
    "a singular gauge transformation automatically ensures that the single occupancy constraint is satisfied .",
    "a brief review of this formalism and important physical consequences will be discussed in section ii . in section iii , we obtain the ground state within a mean field theory , and in section iv we transform the ground state wave function back to the electron representation , thus completing the derivation of the wave function ( [ gswf ] ) .",
    "a discussion of the properties predicted by ( [ gswf ] ) follows and finally a superconducting ground state is obtained .",
    "the final section is devoted to a general discussion about the region of validity ( in the phase diagram ) of this approach , as well as the questions that this study raises . in appendix",
    "a , some detailed derivations of the mean - field theory in the phase string representation are presented . in appendix b ,",
    "we discuss briefly , an effective theory of spin and charge degrees of freedom that are coupled by the phase string . in appendix c",
    ", we show that the ground state obeys time reversal and spin rotational symmetries .",
    "in this section , we reformulate the @xmath0 model using the phase string representation @xcite . this representation , like the slave - particle representations used in the literature @xcite , is an exact reformulation .",
    "however , the phase string formulation has a distinct advantage over these other schemes , in the following sense .",
    "the most singular effects encapsulated in the @xmath0 model are sorted out by a unitary transformation , and all nontrivial phases present in the original model now occur as topological gauge fields . without these gauge fields ,",
    "the model becomes trivial , _",
    "i.e. _ , free of sign problems , which is the case in one dimension , or in the particular case of half filling in two dimensions .",
    "the central issue in two dimensions is then how to handle these topological gauge fields at finite doping .",
    "it turns out that they are well controlled , at least for small doping .",
    "the most singular effect of the hole moving in an af background is the phase string effect .",
    "this leads to a competition between hopping and superexchange processes . since it is most singular at length scales of a lattice constant ( as z@xmath35 signs ) , it is crucial to track this effect explicitly , before constructing any effective theory . as shown by weng _",
    "_ , this can be achieved starting from a slave - fermion representation and by performing a unitary transformation of the basis states @xcite . in this procedure",
    ", the electron operator is decomposed into @xmath36 where holon @xmath37 and spinon @xmath38 operators are both bosonic fields , satisfying the constraint @xmath39 the phase factor @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ mutual ] ) is defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the ( total ) holon number operator , the phase string operator @xmath43 @xmath44 $ ] is a nonlocal operator with @xmath45 and @xmath46 here , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are spinon and holon number operators respectively , at site @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a complex coordinate on the lattice .",
    "it is easily verified that the fermionic statistics of @xmath24 is automatically ensured by @xmath52 ; besides ensuring fermionic statistics , the string operator also incorporates the singular effects of hole motion in the rvb background , as will be discussed later .",
    "the factor @xmath53 guarantees anticommutation relations between opposite spins .",
    "the factor @xmath54 in ( phase ) is added for convenience , and incorporates the marshall sign into the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) of the electron in terms of the holon and spinon operators , which may be regarded as a bosonization scheme for the electron moving in an rvb background .",
    "the same bosonization decomposition can be also obtained from the slave - boson representation weng_94,qhwang .      rewriting the @xmath0 model using the electron decomposition ( [ mutual ] )",
    ", we get @xmath55 where the hopping term @xmath56 and the superexchange term @xmath57 the rvb pair operator @xmath58 in @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 the unique feature in this formalism is the emergence of three phases ( link fields ) : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 defined on the nn links . without these , there should be _ no _ nontrivial sign problem in @xmath64 , because @xmath65 and @xmath66 are both bosonic fields .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath67 would then be real and negative - definite in the occupation number representation of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , the ground state expanded in terms of these bosonic fields will have real and positive coefficients .",
    "therefore , any nontrivial signs ( phases ) of the @xmath0 model arise solely from these three link fields , defined by @xmath68 \\left ( \\sum_\\sigma \\sigma n_{l\\sigma } ^b\\right ) ~ ,   \\label{as}\\ ] ] @xmath69 ~ ,   \\label{sphi0}\\ ] ] and @xmath70 n_l^h~.   \\label{ah}\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that the hamiltonian @xmath67 is invariant under @xmath71 gauge transformations : @xmath72 and @xmath73 thus @xmath61 and @xmath74 are gauge fields , seen by holons and spinons respectively , as the latter carry their gauge charges according to ( u(1)1 ) and ( [ u(1)2 ] ) .",
    "but they are not conventional gauge fields , as they must satisfy the topological constraints : @xmath75 and @xmath76 according to ( [ as ] ) and ( [ ah ] ) , respectively . here",
    "the subscript @xmath77 denotes an arbitrary closed loop such that the fluxes enclosed , @xmath78 @xmath61 and @xmath79 , are determined by the number of spinons and holons respectively , inside the loop @xmath77 ; _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath61 and @xmath80 are not independent gauge fields with their own dynamics .",
    "rather they are directly connected to matter fields as a pair of mutual chern - simons gauge fields @xcite .",
    "the term `` mutual '' refers to the fact that @xmath61 describes quantized @xmath81 fluxoids attached to spinons , coupled to the holons in @xmath82 .",
    "conversely , @xmath74 describes quantized @xmath83 fluxoids bound to holons , coupled to spinons in @xmath59 .",
    "the phase @xmath84 describes a uniform and constant flux with a strength @xmath81 per plaquette : @xmath85 according to ( [ sphi0 ] ) .    in the case of the one dimensional model ,",
    "@xmath86 thus there is no sign problem in the phase - string representation of the @xmath0 model .",
    "it implies that the hamiltonian can be treated within a mean field framework , which indeed results in a correct luttinger - liquid solution for the large - u hubbard model @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "these nn link phases can no longer be `` gauged away '' .",
    "they compose a mutual gauge structure which completely determines the essential sign problem of the @xmath0 model .",
    "these gauge fields are generally well controlled in the regimes of our interest : @xmath62 is a non - dynamic phase describing a constant @xmath83 flux per plaquette ; @xmath61 is canceled when spinons are rvb paired at low - temperature phases ; @xmath74 remains weak at small doping - it vanishes at half filling , where there is no sign problem in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , these gauge fields in the phase string representation are presumably well tractable in low doping and low temperature regimes .",
    "this is one of the main advantages of the phase string representation over other approaches .    finally , it is important to note that the phase string representation is defined in a hilbert space where the total @xmath87 is an eigen operator .",
    "the total numbers of @xmath21 and @xmath22 spinons are conserved individually , such that the topological gauge field @xmath61 behaves smoothly as defined in ( [ as ] ) , depicting fictitious @xmath81 fluxoids bound to spinons .",
    "( non - conserved @xmath87 would result in non - conserved @xmath19 and @xmath20 fluxoids in @xmath61 ) .",
    "different @xmath87 states are connected by the spin flip operators , defined in the phase - string representation as @xmath88 b_{i\\uparrow } ^{\\dagger } b_{i\\downarrow } ,   \\label{s+}\\ ] ] ( a factor @xmath89 has been dropped for simplicity ) and @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "these definitions follow from ( [ mutual ] ) .",
    "the nonlocal phase @xmath92 in ( [ s+ ] ) plays a crucial role in restoring the spin rotational symmetry .",
    "since the @xmath0 model is a projective hamiltonian , the no double occupancy constraint is a central issue .",
    "it imposes a severe restriction on the hilbert space @xmath93 which ensures that the system is a mott insulator at half filling and a doped mott insulator away from half filling . in conventional slave particle decompositions",
    ", the constraint reduces to a single occupancy constraint like ( [ constr ] ) , and is still difficult to treat .",
    "typically , the constraint is relaxed at the level of mean field theory , and restoring its effect beyond the mean field theory ( say , by a gauge theory ) is a very challenging problem .",
    "in contrast , the phase string representation outlined in the previous subsection provides a new way to handle the constraint .",
    "a wavefunction @xmath94 in the electron @xmath77-operator representation is defined in a quantum state as @xmath95 where the @xmath21 spin electron sites , @xmath96 and the @xmath22 spin sites , @xmath97 obey the no double occupancy constraint in the restricted hilbert space of the @xmath0 hamiltonian . on the other hand , in the phase string representation , the wave function @xmath98",
    "is defined as @xmath99 where the indices @xmath100 denote the empty sites , that are _ not _ independent from @xmath101 and @xmath102 under the constraint . here the spinon - holon basis in the phase string representation , @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 where the vacuum @xmath105 is chosen to be filled by holons .",
    "the sign factor @xmath106 in ( [ b - basis ] ) can be identified with the marshall sign , and @xmath107 denotes the total number of @xmath108 spins in sublattice @xmath13 . here and henceforth , we will always use @xmath109 to specify an @xmath21 spin , @xmath9 a @xmath22 spin , and @xmath110 , a holon , where the subscripts @xmath111 , @xmath1 , and @xmath65 label the sequences of the @xmath108 spins , @xmath22 spins , and holons , respectively .",
    "now , the decomposition ( [ mutual ] ) of the electron operator @xmath24 , relates the wave functions written in the two representations : @xmath112 where @xmath113 the coefficient @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 in which @xmath116 and @xmath117 run through all lattice sites , such that @xmath114 is a constant .",
    "correspondingly , the wave functions in the electron and phase string representations are related by @xmath118 which holds generally for the @xmath0 model .",
    "note that the above expression for @xmath119 has been obtained strictly under the no double occupancy constraint .",
    "but if the constraint is relaxed in ( [ k0 ] ) , while still treating @xmath114 as a constant , then one finds @xmath120 for double occupancies when _ any _ two particles ( spinons and/or holons ) occupy the same site ; _ viz . _ ,",
    "@xmath119 defined in ( [ k0 ] ) automatically enforces the constraint ( [ constr ] ) through the jastrow - like factors .",
    "therefore , as far as @xmath94 is concerned , the no double occupancy constraint in @xmath121 or @xmath122 is no longer important , since @xmath119 in ( wavefunction ) naturally plays the role of a projection operator .",
    "clearly , an exact @xmath121 would satisfy the single occupancy constraint ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "but , the point is that an approximate @xmath121 determined without the constraint does not affect @xmath94 , owing to @xmath119 .",
    "it means that in the phase string representation the constraint ( [ constr ] ) is indeed `` unimportant '' , which may be understood in the following way . in the phase string representation ,",
    "the effect of @xmath119 in the original @xmath94 , is transformed into the topological gauge fields@xmath123 @xmath61 and @xmath63 in the hamiltonians , ( [ ht ] ) and ( [ hj ] ) , which describe spinons and holons as mutual vortices , as perceived by each other ( _ cf . _ the discussion in the previous subsection ) .",
    "this clearly implies a mutual repulsion between two species , since a spinon can not stay at the center of its vortex ( which is a holon ) , and _",
    "vice versa_. thus the constraint that a holon and a spinon can not occupy the same site is now reflected in the _ interactions _ present in the new hamiltonian , and the condition ( [ constr ] ) is not needed as an extra condition to enforce .",
    "note that the constraint ( [ constr ] ) also requires the hard core conditions among the holons or spinons themselves .",
    "but since both holon and spinon fields are bosonic fields , local hard core exclusions usually do not involve the sign change of the wave function .",
    "hence , in the phase string representation , the local constraint ( [ constr ] ) is neither crucial nor singular , as far as low energy physics is concerned .      in this subsection",
    ", we point out that the other important effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , the phase string effect , is also explicitly built into this representation via @xmath119 .",
    "let us first rewrite @xmath119 ( [ k0 ] ) in a more compact form , @xmath124where @xmath125and @xmath126it is easily seen that the jastrow - like factors in @xmath127 enforce the single occupancy constraint discussed previously : @xmath127 vanishes if two spins ( or holes ) occupy the same site , or if a hole and a spin occupy the same site .",
    "the factor @xmath127 also explicitly captures the fermionic statistics of electrons .",
    "now let us focus on the additional factor @xmath128 in @xmath119 , which is asymmetric with regard to @xmath21 and @xmath22 spins : it only involves an @xmath21 spin complex coordinate @xmath129 and a holon coordinate @xmath130 .",
    "suppose that the holon is taken along a closed loop shown in fig .",
    "1 . the @xmath119 factor will generally acquire a nontrivial phase through @xmath128 . in the following we examine this .    for a spinon inside or outside the loop",
    ", there will be no net contribution to @xmath128 as the acquired phase is either @xmath131 or @xmath132 under such an operation .",
    "so any nontrivial contribution is solely from spinons occupying lattice sites on the holon s loop - path . at each step of hopping",
    ", the holon under consideration will have to switch positions with a spinon occupying a nn site on the loop , obeying the no double occupancy constraint .",
    "then @xmath128 picks up a minus sign from the jastrow factor in @xmath133 every time when the holon and an @xmath21 spinon are exchanged .",
    "thus , if one changes the holon s coordinate continuously through the loop without encountering other holons , @xmath128 will acquire a sequence of signs , @xmath134where @xmath135 denotes the number of @xmath21 spinons exchanged with the holon during the above thought experiment .",
    "( note that the spinons displaced by holon hopping during the operation should all be restored to the original configuration by _ pure _ spin flips in terms of the superexchange @xmath136 , and this does not generate any further signs in @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the electron wave function @xmath94 , acquires a sign factor ( which can also be thought of as a berry phase ) through @xmath128 : @xmath138 this factor ( for the closed loop ) is just the phase string shown in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath139 denotes the index of spins on the loop exchanged with a holon , under the thought experiment of moving the holon around a closed path ( note that a closed loop on a bipartite lattice always involves an even number of nn links ) . equation ( [ pstring1 ] ) shows that the singular hopping effect is explicitly incorporated in @xmath94 through @xmath119 , in the phase string formulation of the @xmath0 model .    to conclude this section , the two singular effects in the @xmath0 model , _ viz .",
    "_ , the single occupancy constraint and the phase string effect , are explicitly represented by the factor @xmath119 , ( [ k0 ] ) .",
    "consequently the ground state wave function in the phase string representation , @xmath140 is presumably no longer singular , justifying a mean field theory .",
    "a mean field theory ( bosonic rvb theory ) based on the phase string representation of the @xmath0 model was constructed in an earlier paper weng_99 , and we will follow a similar route here in dealing with the spin degrees of freedom",
    ". however , an important distinction in this work is the way the charge degrees of freedom are incorporated , in order to better facilitate and optimize the kinetic energy of the holes , as well as to construct a state in which the no double occupancy constraint is strictly enforced . as shown in sec .",
    "iv , this construction directly results in a pseudogap ground state characterized by a finite pairing amplitude and the emergence of nodal quasiparticles .",
    "the ground state has an inherent superconducting instability which occurs , when phase coherence is realized .",
    "let us begin by considering the superexchange term @xmath136 , which is expressed in terms of an rvb pair operator @xmath141 in ( hj ) .",
    "note that @xmath141 is invariant under the gauge transformation ( [ u(1)2 ] ) .",
    "it is then natural to define the bosonic rvb order parameter by @xmath142for nn sites , @xmath3 and @xmath9 .",
    "this rvb order parameter is different from the rvb order parameter introduced by anderson and collaborators @xcite : it involves the charge degrees of freedom through the gauge field , @xmath143 , and is gauge invariant under ( [ u(1)2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath144 in this theory , and @xmath145 is the sole order parameter . at half filling , @xmath146 @xmath147 in @xmath141 , and @xmath145",
    "reduces to the well known schwinger - boson mean field order parameter @xmath148 @xcite [ in our definition @xmath38 differs from the conventional schwinger boson representation by a sign factor @xmath149 .",
    "the mean field solution describes both long and short range af correlations of the heisenberg model quite well , as will be discussed below .",
    "thus , the bosonic rvb theory we present is ensured to yield good results at half filling , and provides a natural generalization away from half filling .",
    "we now show how the spin degrees of freedom are treated within the bosonic rvb theory .",
    "the superexchange hamiltonian is rewritten as @xmath150where @xmath151 , and @xmath145 is assumed to be real and positive .",
    "the lagrangian multiplier @xmath152 is introduced to implement the single occupancy constraint ( [ constr ] ) on the average .",
    "we reemphasize that @xmath153 is not a mean field hamiltonian in the conventional sense .",
    "spinons are coupled to a gauge field @xmath146 , related to the charge degrees of freedom , and the hamiltonian is invariant under the internal gauge transformation ( [ u(1)2 ] ) .",

    "thus , each spin automatically carries a phase or supercurrent vortex , called a spinon - vortex , in the state described by @xmath251 .",

    "vortices and antivortices are associated with @xmath108 and @xmath22 spins , respectively .",

    "in this paper , we obtained and analyzed the ground state of a pseudogap phase ( or spontaneous vortex phase ) for a doped mott insulator , starting from a generalized mean field treatment of the @xmath0 model in the phase string representation . in this representation , the most singular effects of doping , _ viz .",

    "charge degrees of freedom emerge at finite doping , with a hidden odlro ( [ odlro1 ] ) .",
    "this leads to a finite ( electron ) pairing amplitude , which characterizes the pseudogap structure of the ground state .",
    "the hidden odlro in the charge sector is also found to be the underlying reason for the four nodes in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum , but the ground state is non - fermi - liquid like in the absence of phase coherence .",
    "it is more appropriate to call the pseudogap ground state as a spontaneous vortex phase , since free @xmath5 spins that act like vortices prevent superconducting phase coherence in this state .    two types of low - lying spin excitations above the pseudogap ground state were identified .",

    "superconducting phase coherence is established by an instability which causes rvb pairing of the free spins associated with the twisted holes .",
    "the ensuing ground state ( [ scgs ] ) , is non - bcs - like in many aspects .",
    "the properties of the superconducting ground state ( [ scgs ] ) , especially those involving non - bcs - like features , are very interesting problems to pursue further .",
    "the class of wavefunctions discussed in this paper provides a unified description of mott physics , antiferromagnetism , pseudogap physics , and d - wave superconductivity within a single framework .",
    "there are many basic distinctions between this ground state and bcs - like wave functions .",
    "an important distinction is the independence of the spin excitations from the quasiparticles .",
    "the presence of the pairing amplitude and spontaneous vortices associated with spin excitations is another unique feature and is independent of superconducting phase coherence .",
    "furthermore , generalized jastrow - like factors @xmath119 in ( [ k0 ] ) that appear in the ground state wave function , are incompatible with the ( slater ) determinantal wave functions of the bcs theory .",
    "therefore , the pseudogap and superconducting ground states obtained in this work represent and describe a new state of matter .    given that the state ( [ elgs ] ) undergoes a superconducting instability with phase coherence at low temperature , we may discuss further implications for the global phase diagram .",
    "clearly , the phase coherence condition ( pc1 ) fails in the spin ordered phase , when the spatial separation of the rvb pair , @xmath368 ; indeed , at half filling , the rvb amplitude @xmath392 shows a power law decay at @xmath393 , without a finite length scale , as discussed in sec .",

    "the condition of phase coherence is not satisfied also when the rvb pairing between spins in @xmath31 is continuously reduced to zero , at sufficiently large doping @xmath184 . in this case , the underlying rigidity for binding of vortices and antivortices in the ground state is also destroyed and the superconductivity should be suppressed beyond @xmath184 .",
    "how the ground state wavefunction systematically evolves with the doping concentration and the possible existence of quantum critical points at , say , @xmath395 and @xmath184 , is an important subject for further investigation .",
    "finally , the results presented in this paper can be used as a starting point to pursue several interesting questions , and we indicate a few possible directions here : ( i ) the pseudogap ( spontaneous vortex phase ) ground state is inherently unstable to superconductivity as the result of pairing of the twisted holes .",
    "nonetheless , the pseudogap ground state can still be regarded as a true ground state , for instance , when strong magnetic fields are applied to destroy the rvb pairing of the low - lying spins associated with the backflow of holes .",
    "the study of this state in the presence of strong magnetic fields is thus experimentally relevant .",
    "( ii ) it will be very useful to develop a numerical scheme based on the wavefunction ( [ psie1 ] ) for a variational study . at half - filling",
    ", we used the wavefunction to compute the ground - state energy , magnetization , and equal - time spin - spin correlations by employing the loop gas method .",
    "as pointed out , this gave us accurate results .",
    "however , away from half filling , the rvb amplitude @xmath32 is no longer a real function and loop products generate a fictitious flux proportional to doping concentration [ _ cf . _ ( [ loop ] ) ] .",
    "this leads to a sign problem and further work is necessary to overcome this barrier .",

    "i.e. _ , the phase string effect , occurs in systems even without af long range order .",

    "for the sake of clarity , we shall invoke this approximation in determining @xmath215 and @xmath216 below . in principle , these effects can be incorporated without affecting our results qualitatively .",
