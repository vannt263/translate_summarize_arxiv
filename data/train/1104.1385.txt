    "the production of like - sign top quark pairs would be a striking signature of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . at hadron colliders",
    ", charge conservation implies that @xmath7 pairs can only be produced from initial up or charm quarks .",
    "hence , proton - proton colliders are better suited for studying this signal , in particular in @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , like - sign top production is a golden channel for early discoveries at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "maybe more surprising is the fact that the high statistics accummulated by tevatron already allows to extract useful limits on various sm extensions mediating this process .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration has set a limit on like - sign top production at tevatron , using a luminosity of 6.1 fb@xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 with a 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "as we shall show , this limit puts significant constraints on the different sm extensions that can potentially give observable contributions to @xmath8 .",
    "these extensions must contain boson fields mediating this process at tree level . assuming renormalizable interactions",
    ", these fields can be either extra vector bosons or extra scalars . since the new interactions must fulfill the @xmath11 gauge invariance of the sm , the quantum numbers of the new fields are not arbitrary .",
    "it is easy to check that the only possibilities for particles of spin 1 are  @xcite    * a neutral colour - singlet @xmath4 , which can be in a singlet @xmath12 representation ( denoted here as @xmath13 ) or belong to a triplet @xmath14 ; * a neutral colour - octet @xmath15 , either an isosinglet @xmath16 or member of an isotriplet @xmath17 ; * the charge @xmath1 component of a colour - triplet isodoublet @xmath18 ; * the charge @xmath1 component of a colour - sextet isodoublet @xmath19 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the possible new particles of spin 0 are    * the neutral scalar of an isodoublet , which can be a colour singlet @xmath20 or octet @xmath21 ; * the charge @xmath1 component of a colour - sextet , either an isosinglet @xmath22 or included in an isotriplet @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , charge @xmath1 and neutral particles are exchanged in @xmath24 and @xmath3 channels , respectively . in this letter , we translate the cdf upper limit in eq .",
    "( [ ec : lim ] ) into constraints on the extended sectors enumerated above .",
    "furthermore , we compare with potential lhc measurements with 2010 data ( 35 pb@xmath9 ) and 2011 data ( 1 fb@xmath9 ) .",
    "in particular , we place direct limits on flavour - changing neutral ( fcn ) couplings of new neutral vector bosons @xmath4 , @xmath15 as well as neutral scalars . in order to unify the computations for the different fields , we make use of effective field theory in the following manner : we first integrate out the new heavy states and obtain their contribution to @xmath8 in terms of four - fermion operators ; then , we obtain the cross section in terms of effective operator coefficients . in an appendix",
    "we discuss the range of validity of this approximation and present exact results for light @xmath4 bosons .",
    "we devote special attention to the implications of these limits for the @xmath2 forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry at tevatron .",
    "one mechanism that has been suggested to enhance this asymmetry and thus explain the measured values , in particular @xmath25 for @xmath26 gev  @xcite , is the exchange of a flavour - violating @xmath4 boson in the @xmath3 channel  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , for a single real @xmath4 , this automatically implies like - sign @xmath7 production .",
    "the relation between the two processes can easily be understood , without precise knowledge of the details to be given below , by taking the cp conjugate of one of the two vertices ( the fact that the vector boson is real is crucial ) . here",
    ", we show that the non - observation of like - sign tops at tevatron already rules out these models as the sole explanation of the tevatron @xmath2 asymmetry , except for very light @xmath4 masses which , interestingly , are consistent with a recent cdf dijet excess  @xcite .",
    "we also note that this direct relation between @xmath7 production and the value of @xmath27 does not hold any longer when more than one @xmath4 boson is present , as in the model in ref .",
    "@xcite . among the other new particles that can enhance the fb asymmetry , some belong to the list above .",
    "therefore , the limits from @xmath7 production reduce the parameter space of extensions with these particles .",
    "the process @xmath8 is absent in the sm at the tree level but it can be mediated by new vector bosons in six possible @xmath28 ( irreducible ) representations  @xcite , or by scalars in four possible representations .",
    "triplet representations  @xcite : isotriplets coupling to @xmath29 and isosinglets coupling to @xmath30 .",
    "however , their coupling matrices are anti - symmetric and diagonal couplings to @xmath31 and @xmath32 vanish .",
    "] they are all collected in table  [ tab : lagr ] , where in the first column we write the symbol used to label them .",
    "the relevant interaction lagrangian is included as well . in the last column",
    "we display the symmetry properties , if any , of the coupling matrices @xmath33 .",
