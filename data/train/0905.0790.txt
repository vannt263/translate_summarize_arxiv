    "<S> we can calculate the rashba parameter @xmath16=1.37ev . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - splitting is well resolved in the data . </S>",
    "<S> the average line width for the spin - split states at the band maximum ( @xmath27@xmath23 ) is 195mev , which accounts for intrinsic lifetime as well as interactions and scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of the states is about 220mev .    </S>",

    "<S> it can not be observed in the data .    to support our interpretation of the observed spin - splitting , we conducted spin - resolved first principles band structure calculations , which were performed in close analogy to our previous calculations on the rb effect @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the subsequent kkr and relativistic layer - kkr calculations use the structural data from vasp as input . the spectral density @xmath36 is obtained from the imaginary part of the site - dependent green function . </S>",
    "<S> resolved with respect to spin orientation ( index @xmath37 ) and angular momentum , it allows a detailed analysis of the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath38 reveals the characteristic spin splitting of rb - split bands .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the band structure calculations are shown in fig.[fig : calculation ] for the @xmath6-direction in ( a ) and for the @xmath39-direction in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity scale shows the total spectral density ( @xmath40 ) of the states multiplied by the sign of the spin - polarization sgn(@xmath41 ) perpendicular to the high symmetry line , i.  e.  blue and red colors correspond to opposite spin - polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations reproduce all the main features of the measured band structure . in particular , the splitting of the s1 band around the @xmath10-point along the @xmath6-direction is well documented . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in figure [ fig : calculation ] the two branches of the split s1 band clearly show opposite spin - polarization , i.  e. a giant spin - splitting in the electronic structure of bi / si(111 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - splitting is strongly anisotropic around @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar band topology , which was observed in the experiment is clearly reproduced in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this can again be attributed to the lower symmetry of wave vectors @xmath43 within ( @xmath44 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath45 ) to a mirror plane of the system . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceived that this feature results from the ` trimerization ' of the three bi sites in the 2d unit cell ; calculations with a reduced @xmath32 ( i.  e. larger distance between bi trimer atoms ) indicate an even smaller splitting along @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the calculations show that about 83% of the spin - split states at the @xmath10-point are localized in the bi adlayer and about 16% in the first si layer . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus speculate that the spin - splitting is particularly influenced by the bi adlayer and that trimerization symmetry breaking increases the effect of the in - plane potential gradient .    </S>",
    "<S> the giant spin - splitting in the bi / si(111 ) trimer system has a similar origin as in the bi / ag(111 ) surface alloy : an inversion symmetry breaking in the plane of the surface leads to a strong contribution from an in - plane potential gradient , which substantially enhances the spin - splitting . in both systems </S>",
    "<S> the threefold symmetry of the underlying substrate breaks the in - plane inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering only the topmost layer , the trimer formation in bi / si(111 ) also leads to a breaking of the in - plane inversion symmetry ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure ] ) , which is not the case for the bi / ag(111 ) surface alloy .    comparing the spin - splitting of the bi / si(111 ) electronic structure to semiconductor heterostructures </S>",
    "<S> , we find that in the latter the spin - splitting is substantially smaller . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for an inverted ingaas / inalas heterostructure a rashba constant of @xmath46ev  has been measured @xcite . with an effective mass of @xmath47 , </S>",
    "<S> a rashba energy of @xmath48ev can be calculated . for hgte quantum wells </S>",
    "<S> a rashba constant @xmath49ev  has been found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , here the spin - splitting has been identified to be proportional to @xmath50 instead of a linear dependence @xcite . for the bi / si(111 ) system , </S>",
    "<S> the rashba energy @xmath26mev as well as the rashba parameter @xmath51ev  are much bigger . from the momentum </S>",
    "<S> offset @xmath52@xmath23 we can calculate that a phase shift of the spin precession angle @xmath53 can be obtained after a length @xmath54 of only @xmath55 nm . in the ingaas / inalas heterostructure a length of 400 nm has been estimated . while these figures show the excellent potential of the bi / si(111 ) system , additional measurements giving insight into the transport properties , such as shubnikov - de haas oscillations , are necessary to further elaborate the suitability of this system for spintronics applications . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding experiments are in progress .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the trimer phase of bi on si(111 ) shows a giant spin - splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results reveal the characteristic band dispersion of a rb - type spin - splitting with a peculiar band topology at the @xmath10 point . </S>",
    "<S> they are confirmed by first principles band structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting is caused by the spin - orbit interaction induced rb effect in combination with a strong contribution from the in - plane gradient due to the reduced symmetry of the trimer structure and the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this spin - splitting is of the same order of magnitude as the one reported for bi / ag(111 ) and orders of magnitude lager than a typical spin - splitting reported for semiconductor heterostructures . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we have transferred the concept of giant spin - splitting onto a semiconducting substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this gives excellent perspectives for the use of this concept in the field of spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the silicon substrate makes this system compatible with existing semiconductor technology . on the fundamental side </S>",
    "<S> such systems are interesting for , e.  g. , the spin hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy separation of the spin - split states ( 220mev ) is larger than the lifetime broadening ( 195mev ) , it may be easier to distinguish the extrinsic and intrinsic spin hall effects .    </S>",
