    "all simulations are performed using the lb method on a @xmath42 lattice for a binary fluid , with the bounce - back - on links method used to handle momentum exchange with solid particles @xcite , as extended to the binary fluid case in @xcite .",
    "the fluid - fluid interfacial tension and width are determined by the parameters of ginzburg - landau free energy functional @xmath43= \\int dv \\left ( \\frac{a}{2}\\psi^2 + \\frac{b}{4}\\psi^4 +   \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(\\nabla \\psi)^2 \\right)$ ] , where @xmath44 is a compositional order parameter .",
    "following @xcite we express these parameters in lattice units ( lu ) as @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; the interfacial thickness and the nominal interfacial tension are deduced as @xmath47 lu and @xmath48 lu respectively .",
    "the fluid viscosity is set at @xmath49 lu .",
    "lattice units are as defined in @xcite but for our purposes are arbitrary : all that matters is the bond number .",
    "note that the reynolds number , which controls the relative importance of inertia compared to viscosity , remains small throughout our simulations which represent the stokes flow limit @xcite .",
    "the sedimentation velocity of one particle @xmath50 can be used to define a capillary number ca @xmath51 which remains small in all our simulations .    from lb",
    "benchmark tests with this parameter set , the numerical value of surface tension is determined as @xmath52 lu which is 4% less than the nominal value @xmath53 .",
    "( discrepancies of this scale are common in lb @xcite . )",
    "monodisperse neutral - wetting particles are introduced with hydrodynamic radius @xmath54 lu .",
    "this choice is imposed by the numerical resources available ; note however that @xmath55 is only twice the interfacial width @xmath56 .",
    "for that reason , one expects some discrepancy between the values of bo@xmath8@xmath15 seen in simulations and those arising for a structureless interface ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the values tabulated in the main text are those found by numerical simulations on a single particle residing on a droplet of radius @xmath58 .",
    "we have however confirmed that for a flat interface ( @xmath59 ) , our methods recover the expected result : indeed we find bo@xmath8@xmath60 .",
    "particle ejection is defined by the surface - average value of @xmath44 becoming sufficiently different from zero .",
    "interparticle forces are mediated by a soft - core potential @xmath61 chosen to prevent the surface - to - surface interparticle separation @xmath62 from becoming too small .",
    "( to model capillary forces correctly , it is important that the lattice boltzmann nodes surrounding each particle mainly represent fluid not solid sites . )",
    "we choose @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the maximum range of the interaction ; we select @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the particles behave as nearly impenetrable spheres of radius @xmath69 lu . finally , to allow for the discretization error in the hydrodynamic forces at small separations , a lubrication force ( proportional to the normal component of the interparticle velocity ) acts whenever @xmath70 lu .",
    "the criterion @xmath71 lu @xmath72 is used to identify load - bearing particle contacts ; this lies within the range of the soft - core potential defined above .",
    "figure [ fig : order / random ] shows snapshots of the particle configurations in much smaller droplets ( @xmath73 ) , prepared initially in ordered ( square lattice ) and disordered states , at two different later times .",
    "these are for the lowest unstable bo ( @xmath74 bo@xmath8@xmath29 ) so that both droplets will subsequently break .",
    "the left pictures in figures [ fig : order / random](a ) and [ fig : order / random](b ) are configurations where @xmath40 has reached the near - saturation plateau value ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : ncluster ] ) showing semi - crystalline clusters at the droplet bottom .",
    "the right pictures in figures [ fig : order / random](a ) and [ fig : order / random](b ) are the configurations immediately before the first particle detachment . in each case",
    "there is a neck close to the droplet equator , with load - bearing particles below the neck .",
    "although @xmath0 here is quite small , these configurations are remarkably similar to those seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : stable / unstable ] for @xmath37 and even @xmath75 .",
    "figure [ fig : n194ah7.8/unstable ] shows the breakup mode for an emulsion droplet ( @xmath37 ) in which the hard - core interaction radius of the particles is unchanged but the radius they occupy on the interface is halved . for a given gravitational force per particle , this does not alter the force balance argument for the collective detachment of the lower hemisphere .",
    "however it does reduce four - fold the maximum total force that can be transmitted to the bottom - most particle without this detaching individually from the interface . in this case , a ` keystone ' type failure mode is seen , in which particles stream off the bottom of the droplet without entrainment of the enclosed fluid .",
    "note that similar physics could arise for partially wetting particles with a contact angle far from 90 degrees : in this case also , the radius of the interfacial disc covered by each particle is significantly less than its hard sphere interaction radius .",
    "this again reduces the collective force sustainable without individual detachment , and therefore lowers stability with respect to the keystone detachment mode without having the same effect on the collective mode ( in which a naive force balance again equates the total mass in the lower hemisphere to @xmath76 , independent of contact angle ) .",
    "the following online movies are available showing the time evolution of stable and unstable droplets for various sizes and initial conditions ."

    "<S> we simulate the response of a particle - stabilized emulsion droplet in an external force field , such as gravity , acting equally on all @xmath0 particles . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the field strength required for breakup ( at fixed initial area fraction ) decreases markedly with droplet size , because the forces act cumulatively , not individually , to detach the interfacial particles . </S>",
    "<S> the breakup mode involves the collective destabilization of a solidified particle raft occupying the lower part of the droplet , leading to a critical force per particle that scales approximately as @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the stabilization of emulsions is an important issue in industry , where it controls the functionality and shelf - life of many products @xcite . alongside traditional surfactants , colloidal particles or nanoparticles </S>",
    "<S> have long been used to stabilize emulsion droplets ( pickering emulsions ) @xcite , with several emerging applications that exploit the nonequilibrium nature of their adsorption to the fluid - fluid interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however this also poses obstacles to formulation : to maintain emulsion stability , it is essential that the colloidal particles remain sequestered on the interface , even when the system is subject to external challenges @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> brownian motion is generally insufficient to cause detachment @xcite , so we ignore it here . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , external body forces acting equally on each particle can , if strong enough , overcome the capillary forces holding them in place . </S>",
    "<S> destabilizing forces can be caused by magnetic or electric fields or their gradients , and also by gravity . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity we refer mainly to gravity in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> a groundbreaking experimental study was performed by melle _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , using decane droplets in water stabilized by paramagnetic particles </S>",
    "<S> . they demonstrated , using a simple bar magnet , controlled field - gradient induced breakup of an otherwise highly stable emulsion . </S>",
    "<S> a second study uses instead the dielectrophoretic force caused by an electric field gradient @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a third recent study has found complex dynamics in droplets stabilized by supra - colloidal ( 400@xmath2 m ) particles under gravity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( scaling by the bond number , defined below , indicates that the same physics should arise for , e.g. , 1@xmath2 m particles under bench - top centrifugation . ) </S>",
    "<S> although field - induced breakup is simultaneously a threat to an emulsion s stability and a promising route to its controlled breakage , the dependence of the critical field for breakup on the droplet size is far from understood .    </S>",
    "<S> previously we performed lattice boltzmann ( lb ) simulations on emulsion structures ( primarily bicontinuous @xcite ) stabilized by magnetic colloids in the presence of a magnetic field gradient @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there we argued that the effect of the force does not act separately on each particle but is cumulative across the structure . </S>",
    "<S> ( this explains the very low field - gradients required in @xcite . ) by that argument , a major fraction of the weight of all particles could be loaded onto a single ` keystone ' particle at the droplet bottom which should then detach , initiating breakup . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study in detail the breakup dynamics of isolated emulsion droplets coated with @xmath0 ( essentially hard - sphere ) particles under gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we find a scaling of the critical force with @xmath0 that is inconsistent with the ` keystone ' argument , and associated instead with a failure mode in which a raft of jammed particles detaches from the droplet base taking liquid with it .    </S>",
    "<S> _ control parameters : _ for a single particle adsorbed onto a flat horizontal interface between two fluids of equal density , detachment is controlled by the bond number @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the particle radius , @xmath5 the fluid - fluid interfacial tension , and @xmath6 the normal detachment force ( in gravity , @xmath6 is the buoyancy force on the particle ) . </S>",
    "<S> detachment of an isolated particle ( @xmath7 ) occurs at a critical bond number bo@xmath8@xmath9 which depends on the fluid - solid interfacial tensions through the contact angle @xmath10 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider only neutral wetting ( @xmath11 ) for which bo@xmath8@xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical bond number for detachment of one particle from a fluid sphere of radius @xmath13 should also depend on @xmath14 ; to allow for this we define bo@xmath8@xmath15 such that bo@xmath8@xmath16 bo@xmath8@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerically determined bo@xmath8@xmath15 additionally reflects various sources of discretization error ( e.g. , the fact that in lb the particle radius is not much larger than the interfacial width @xcite ) . _ simulations : _ the lb methodology used in this work is by now standard @xcite and summarized in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition in our simulations comprises a fluid droplet of radius @xmath13 , immersed in another fluid of equal mass density , with @xmath0 neutrally wetting particles present on its surface . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a near - constant surface area fraction @xmath17 ; this is high enough to represent a stable pickering emulsion droplet but low enough to allow particles to rearrange on application of even a weak body force . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen @xmath0 values are @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> each droplet is placed in a box , with periodic boundary conditions ( a repeat with closed - box boundaries for @xmath20 gave near - identical results ) , whose lb lattice size ( depending on @xmath13 ) lies between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have examined three different initial arrangements of particles : one disordered , one a regular hexagonal packing and one a regular square packing ( subject to the defects required to tile these onto a sphere ) . for the ordered configurations , initial particle coordinates lie on the vertices of a suitable polyhedron . </S>",
    "<S> the particles and droplet are then relaxed in the absence of body forces ( @xmath23 ) to allow the interfacial structure to equilibrate . </S>",
    "<S> once this is done , a vertical body force @xmath6 is switched on ; this acts directly on each particle . to prevent overall translation of the droplet s center of mass , </S>",
    "<S> a balancing buoyancy force @xmath24 is applied as a uniform upward force density on the fluid nodes occupied by the droplet interior . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the droplet is then evolved by the lb algorithm which faithfully includes the effects of fluid flow and hydrodynamic interactions .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +    _ results : _ we define the critical bond number bo@xmath8@xmath25 as the threshold beyond which one or more particles break away from a droplet covered by @xmath0 particles . for bo @xmath26 bo@xmath8@xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> the droplet instead achieves a final steady state that is distorted but not ruptured . </S>",
    "<S> since we work at constant @xmath27 , we now drop the argument @xmath28 and refer simply to bo@xmath8@xmath29 . in practice </S>",
    "<S> we find particle ejection always precedes disconnection of a droplet into two pieces and therefore used the time of first detachment , @xmath30 , as a measure of when breakup occurs . </S>",
    "<S> ( as time unit we adopt the stokes time @xmath31 . )    starting from an equilibrated spherical droplet and switching on the external forces , particles start to move downwards ( while the buoyancy force holds the droplet up ) . </S>",
    "<S> upper sections of the droplet become bare @xcite and a dense interfacial ` sediment ' is created towards the bottom of the droplet . as the sediment builds , forces are transmitted to the particles beneath . </S>",
    "<S> the lower part of the droplet can then become highly distorted . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to droplets initiated from a disordered configuration , which maintain a prolate spheroidal shape throughout the stable regime , the ordered arrangements give almost symmetric force patterns in which the most unstable particle lies at the tip of a cusp that develops at the droplet bottom . for bo </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 bo@xmath8@xmath29 , such a cusped configuration can remain stable indefinitely . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stable / unstable ] shows snapshots for both stable and unstable cases at the time @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> shown in red are those particles whose interparticle separation @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion identifies the main load - bearing particles in the system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the body force changes only by two percent between the highest stable and lowest unstable value examined in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stable / unstable ] , there is a clear difference in their configurations at the detachment time @xmath30 . in both cases , close - packed clusters of @xmath33 load - bearing particles are observed at the bottom of droplets ; while the geometry of these regions depends on initial conditions as detailed above , in the last stable droplet configuration @xmath34 for the ordered and disordered cases . in the unstable state , immediately prior to particle ejection , @xmath35 is rather larger but again nearly independent of the initial condition . in table </S>",
    "<S> [ table : n194unstable ] we report @xmath36 for several values of bo just above the threshold , in the case of ordered ( square ) and disordered packings with @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath38 in all unstable cases , with rather little dependence on bo ( once the critical value is exceeded ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , however , a stronger body force ( larger bo ) causes the detachment time @xmath30 to decrease markedly .    </S>",
    "<S> .the time @xmath39 of first particle detachment and the size @xmath40 of the load - bearing cluster immediately prior to @xmath30 for unstable droplets of @xmath37 with ordered and disordered initial states . </S>",
    "<S> superscript @xmath41 denotes bo@xmath8@xmath29 ( numerically , the smallest bo found for which breakup occurs ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ conclusion : _ we have investigated by lb simulations the destabilization of an emulsion droplet coated with hard spheres under a body force that acts equally on all the particles @xcite . we confirmed that the force required for destabilization is far less than would be expected if the force were to cause independent detachment of the particles from the fluid - fluid interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also far greater than would be expected if the weight of all @xmath0 particles were to accumulate as a net detachment force on a single ` keystone ' particle at the bottom of the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> that picture , which implicitly considers the stabilizing particle layer to comprise a 2d fluid , must now be replaced by one in which the lower part of that layer has solidified . a simple geometrical analysis then suggests a critical bond number scaling as @xmath1 which gives a satisfactory first account of the simulation data .    _ </S>",
