    "the precise determination of light quark masses , @xmath5 , from full qcd simulations is of considerable interest since the lattice provides the only known access to their absolute scale .",
    "we have pointed out some time ago  @xcite that vacuum polarization effects have sizeable impact on extracting @xmath5 from the empirical @xmath6 ratio .",
    "this became manifest in a substantial ambiguity in the determination of @xmath5 from the vector ward identities .",
    "indeed , there is a freedom of chiral extrapolation ( @xmath0e ) on the lattice : at @xmath7 _",
    "e.g. _ , the extrapolation along the line of equal valence and sea quark hopping parameters , @xmath8 ( direct extrapolation ) , yields a value for @xmath9 which is roughly a factor of two below the result from a semi - quenched , two - step extrapolation procedure . in the latter one first determines the values of @xmath10 for each ensemble with fixed value of @xmath11 ( similar to quenched simulations ) . for each @xmath12 @xmath13",
    "is computed and , subsequently , this function is extrapolated to the physical point @xmath14 , at this given value of @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore it has been shown by cp - pacs that the ambiguity seen at finite @xmath16 goes away after ce  @xcite .",
    "cp - pacs has used an improved action that allowed them to go to rather coarse lattices , providing them with a long lever arm for the various ce . in the present context ,",
    "their lever arm turned out to be of little value , however , since the extrapolation with a linear ce led them to a very poor @xmath17 with such an ansatz , invalidating the small error on their value of @xmath5 .",
    "given this situation we are motivated to resume the question with the standard wilson fermionic action and attempt a scaling analysis , by complementing previous sesam / t@xmath0l data with another set of vacuum configurations at @xmath18 , as specified in table  [ tab : params ] .    [",

    "the determination of light quark masses can be sketched by the following steps : + ( a ) fix @xmath19 from the @xmath0e of @xmath20 ; + ( b ) get @xmath21 from @xmath22 using the @xmath0e of @xmath23 ; + ( c ) determine @xmath24 via @xmath25 ; + ( d ) compute the quark mass in the lattice - scheme : @xmath26 ( e ) convert into @xmath27-scheme using @xmath28 ( f ) rescale the quark mass to @xmath29 ; + ( g ) extrapolate @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 within this work was determined using a tadpole improved perturbative procedure @xcite .    in the case of the above - quoted semi - quenched @xmath0e procedure the results for @xmath32 have to be extrapolated to the physical mass of the sea quarks before sending @xmath30 .",
    "in order to achieve appropriate statistical errors throughout this analysis one has to take into account the correlation between the observables .",
    "these correlations occur especially within the semi - quenched analysis , since all observables inside a @xmath0e are determined on the same set of configurations .",
    "therefore all errors are determined using the jackknife procedure within all steps ( a ) to ( g ) sketched above .",
    "[ fig : mlight_b5.6 ] shows the results for @xmath5 in the @xmath27-scheme for @xmath3 versus @xmath11 .",
    "obviously the semi - quenched values for @xmath33 on the small lattice and for @xmath34 on the larger lattice deviate from the general behavior of the data .",
    "a more detailed investigation shows that this is due to finite - size effects .",
    "hence these two points are neglected in the extrapolation to the physical sea quark mass .",
    "furthermore we reconfirm the above mentioned discrepancy between the results for the semi - quenched and the direct extrapolations .",
    "[ fig : mlight_b5.5 ] displays the corresponding results for @xmath4 . here",
    "the value for @xmath35 clearly shows finite - size effects and is hence discarded .     in @xmath36 . ]",
    "[ fig : mlight_vs_a ] presents the ce @xmath37 , with @xmath16 as obtained from @xmath38 at @xmath21 .",
    "the continuum value for the light quark mass is determined using a constrained fit to the semi - quenched and direct values at two lattice constants each .",
    "the fit is also shown in the figure .",
    "as a final result for the light quark mass we get @xmath39    within the bigger errors of our analysis , this number is in good agreement with the result quoted by cp - pacs @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the light quark mass there is no reasonable way to carry out a direct @xmath0e for the mass of the strange quark .",
    "this is due to the fact that directly extrapolated results would describe mesons with strange valence quarks within a sea of strange sea quarks .",
    "indeed , nature is given by a sea of light sea quarks and therefore only the semi - quenched @xmath0e makes sense .    on the other hand",
    "there are several ways to determine @xmath41 , the hopping - parameter corresponding to the mass of the strange quark . in this analysis we investigated three different inputs : @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    from a semi - quenched analysis of @xmath40 , one obtains the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstrange_vs_a ] .",
    "the data clearly show deviations for the different definitions of the quark mass which are expected to disappear in the continuum .",
    "hence again a constrained fit was done for the ce .     in @xmath36 . ]",
    "the result of this fit for the mass of the strange quark is @xmath45    obviously the strange quark mass needs all the more a larger range of @xmath16-values for a safe ce .",
    "we conclude that ( _ i _ ) statistical errors of 5 to 10 % can be achieved before ce , ( _ ii _ ) with additional simulations at smaller @xmath15 , a reliable @xmath5-determination with 10 % accuracy is within reach .",
