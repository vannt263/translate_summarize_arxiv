    "the analysis reported here was done in the years 20023 in collaboration with two senior members of the bes collaboration .",
    "the work was funded by the royal society and queen mary college via an official agreement with the chinese academy of sciences and the bes collaboration .",
    "this agreement guaranteed access to bes 2 data for the purpose of publications .",
    "since then , the bes management has refused to appoint internal referees , hence blocking a collaboration publication and comments from the collaboration .",
    "the data illuminate the spectroscopy of @xmath19 mesons and should be in the public domain .",
    "there is a responsibility to publish work which has been supported from public funds with approximately @xmath24 .",
    "the wording of the article is close to a document submitted late in 2008 to the bes management , except for some clarification of wording .",
    "there have been many earlier studies of @xmath11 in @xmath2 radiative decays , @xmath25 annihilation and @xmath26 interactions .",
    "extensive references are to be found in the listings of the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "their review concludes that two nearby @xmath27 resonances are required in the mass range 14001500 mev .",
    "the lower one is at 1405 mev , decaying to @xmath20 and @xmath9 , where @xmath28 stands for the @xmath29 s - wave .",
    "the upper state is at 1475 mev , decaying dominantly to @xmath30 .",
    "however , almost all of these analyses are based on fitting the strong @xmath30 channel with a breit - wigner resonance of constant width .",
    "the threshold for this channel is at 1390 mev , although smeared out to some extent by the 50 mev full - width of the @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath32 channel with @xmath3 is produced in a p wave . as a result ,",
    "the intensity of the @xmath32 channel increases with kaon momentum @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "this rapid @xmath5-dependence enhances the upper side of the @xmath32 peak strongly .",
    "it also gives rise to a strong dispersive correction in the breit - wigner denominator , as described in subsection 4.3 .",
    "only one previous analysis includes the first feature and none contains the second .",
    "they are therefore prejudiced towards two separate resonances .    as well as the possible @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", there is evidence from four experiments on @xmath35 for @xmath36 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in these data ,",
    "the possibile exchange of both natural and unnatural parity mesons requires a rank 2 analysis , with partial interference between the two alternatives , hence incomplete interferences between @xmath17 and @xmath36 .",
    "the possibility of no interference between @xmath17 and @xmath36 leaves some room for uncertainty in conclusions .",
    "there is no definite evidence for @xmath36 in @xmath37 decays and only weak evidence in @xmath25 annihilation @xcite .",
    "there are therefore three controversial candidates for two radial excitations of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "some people have argued that @xmath36 has been confused with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "others argue from the strong production of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath2 radiative decays that one of them is the @xmath40 glueball @xcite .",

    "radiative decays , the @xmath39 is produced with an intensity a factor 5 larger than the @xmath44 .",
    "similar mixing for radial excitations could explain surprisingly strong production of @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 in @xmath2 decays and @xmath25 annihilation .",
    "there are two likely scenarios .",
    "the first is that the @xmath36 does not exist and @xmath12 may be assigned dominantly as @xmath45 and @xmath13 as @xmath46 .",
    "the second scenario is that @xmath36 does exist and @xmath47 and @xmath13 are really one resonance .",
    "these two alternatives are fitted to data presented here .",
    "the @xmath5-dependence of the breit - wigner amplitudes is treated fully for the first time .",
    "the higher mass range for @xmath20 is also of considerable interest .",
    "bes ii data provide evidence for a 7 standard deviation signal in @xmath48 for a narrow @xmath49 with @xmath50 mev @xcite .",
    "it is important to know if it appears in @xmath20 and if so with what branching fraction .",
    "section 2 presents technical details of the selection of data for the channels @xmath23 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and discusses backgrounds .",
    "the @xmath51 channel has not been examined before .",
    "it is useful in establishing the magnitude of possible @xmath53 contributions to @xmath54 .",
    "sections 3 and 4 present features of the data and the formulae needed to treat the @xmath5-dependence of breit - wigner amplitudes .",
    "section 5 gives details of the fit to the mass range up to 1600 mev .",
    "this is the centre - piece of the paper .",
    "section 6 considers the high mass range above 1600 mev and estimates the magnitude possible for @xmath55 ; the low value observed is inconsistent with the @xmath49 being dominantly @xmath45 .",

    "the physics analysis will be restricted to the mass range below 2 gev .",

    "the pdg quotes an average branching fraction @xmath104",
    ". however , this refers to a crystal ball measurement @xcite claiming a peak in @xmath20 at 1700 mev , substantially different to what is observed here .      for this final state ,",
    "the main background arises from @xmath106 after the loss of one photon .",
    "the contamination is estimated to be @xmath107 from a study of side - bins either side of the @xmath44 peak , together with a monte carlo estimate of the shape of the background .",

    "1(f ) shows the mass distribution of events fitting as @xmath109 .",
    "the number of events is too small to allow a meaningful physics analysis .",

    "the essential point is that the number of signal events is a factor 100 smaller than for @xmath72 .",
    "after background subtraction , there are 22 events up to an @xmath108 mass of 1.8 gev and 125 up to 2 gev .",

    "errors are again systematic , from the acceptance .",
    "these events have been selected initially with at least one photon and with 4 charged tracks having balancing charges .",
    "one and only one charged kaon must be identified by time - of - flight or @xmath58 ; at least two charged tracks must be positively identified as pions .",
    "events are then subjected to a @xmath112 kinematic fit , requiring a @xmath113 probability @xmath76 .",
    "the mass of one @xmath114 pair must lie within 25 mev of the @xmath115 .",
    "this pair must be consistent with a vertex within 6 cm of the second vertex defined by the other two charged particles .",
    "2 shows the mass distribution for the reconstructed @xmath115 before the kinematic fit .",
    "there is a clean peak with only a @xmath116 background , which can be evaluated accurately .",

    "the kinematic fit is made assuming that the @xmath115 decays at the primary vertex ; the effect of this assumption on the selection of events is simulated by a monte carlo study .",
    "there is a small loss of events , but no significant bias to kinematics .",
    "alternative selections have been made fitting two separate vertices .",
    "these lead to a larger loss of events because of the difficulties of reconciling two vertices with the kinematics ; within statistics , there is no change to physics conclusions .    at the end of the data selection , there are 5638 events including an estimated background of 1068 .",
    "the background is substantially smaller over the reduced mass range up to 1600 mev .",
    "the average efficiency for data reconstruction is @xmath119 .",
    "the resulting branching ratio , corrected for charge combinations , is @xmath120 = [ 2.2   \\pm 0.3(syst)]\\times 10^{-3},\\ ] ] up to a mass of 1800 mev .",
    "the error is almost entirely systematic .",
    "a @xmath121 error arises from extrapolating the partial wave analysis over the holes of the detector , @xmath122 uncertainty in the effects of cuts , and @xmath123 in the background ; these errors are added in quadrature .",
    "the pdg quotes an average of @xmath124 , though this is derived from four values spanning the range @xmath125 .",
    "[ htb ]    -16 mm -6 mm    the monte carlo used here to simulate the bes detector was the standard simbes package released in february 2002 , in its version as of march 2003 . during discussions with the bes management",
    ", they have claimed that alterations to the calibration of the time - of - flight system after march 2003 could affect the selection of events .",
    "this point is discussed in detail in the accompanying paper on @xmath126 data @xcite . in that analysis , no systematic discrepancy is observed between @xmath127 and time - of - flight , and the same is true for present data ; no contamination of @xmath128 events by @xmath129 is observed above the @xmath130 level . in the present data ,",
    "there is again no observed confusion between @xmath114 and @xmath131 . for @xmath72 data , contamination from @xmath74 is obviously @xmath132 because of the small observed branching fraction for that channel .",
    "there is no evidence for contamination from @xmath106 , which is kinematically well separated from @xmath133 ; such contamination is estimated to be @xmath132 . for @xmath134 data ,",
    "the selection of the @xmath115 limits possible background to @xmath116 .",
    "the observed background under the @xmath115 is consistent with that originating from @xmath135 ; it rises with @xmath136 mass as expected for that source .",
    "3 shows the @xmath136 mass distribution in @xmath137 .",
    "a small @xmath138 peak is visible at 1285 mev . then there is a strong but asymmetric peak at @xmath139 mev on a slowly rising background .",
    "there may be a small structure causing a drop at 1530 mev , though this could be a large statistical fluctuation .",
    "a similar shoulder is visible at 1510 mev in mark iii data of bai et al .",
    "several alternative prescriptions for fitting this shoulder will be described .    the raw mass distribution for @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) and fits to it will be shown in detail below in figs . 7 and 11 .",
    "there is a narrow peak at @xmath140 mev with a full width of 60 mev .",
    "there is also a sharp rise at 1500 mev .",
    "it is vital to realise from the outset that these structures are superimposed on a large and broad @xmath40 signal extending over the whole mass range from 1200 to 2000 mev and interfering coherently , see fig .",
    "7(b ) below . without the inclusion of this broad component , fits fail completely to describe the @xmath20 mass projection . in particular",
    ", the broad component plays a major role in fitting the shoulder at 1550 mev .",
    "the @xmath141 data contain a similar broad peak at 1600 mev in @xmath142 with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is natural that some @xmath142 pairs will de - excite to @xmath143 or @xmath6 with @xmath144 in the decay .",
    "it is also possible that the @xmath142 peak at 1600 mev is resonant .",
    "[ htb ]    -8 mm -6 mm    dalitz plots for @xmath145 are shown for three mass ranges in fig .",
    "the upper 3 panels are for data and the second three from the fit to @xmath11 reported below .",
    "the lower set does not contain the statistical fluctuations of the upper set and the plotting procedure makes it appear that there are some differences between data and fit .",
    "however , a check on all bins shows no evidence for systematic discrepancies .",
    "the main feature in all three cases is a peak due to two crossing @xmath88 bands .",
    "[ htb ]    -6 mm -6 mm    dalitz plots for @xmath136 are shown in fig 5 for three mass ranges . here",

    "there is a strong enhancement near the intersection of these bands in figs .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is much reduced in fig .",
    "this is due to the zero in the @xmath29 amplitude near the middle of the @xmath31 band , arising from the angular dependence of the partial wave amplitude in the decay .",
    "the aim of the analysis is to fit the data in terms of conventional resonances , plus the broad interfering @xmath3 component observed both here and in the @xmath147 data",
    ". it would be good if the spin composition of @xmath20 and @xmath136 could be determined in narrow slices of mass , and this has been tried .",
    "the main conclusion from that attempt is that @xmath40 is strongly dominant for both sets of data . in @xmath136 data , contributions from @xmath148",
    "are identified clearly in the narrow mass ranges of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "there is also definite evidence for a small @xmath149 contribution continuing above @xmath16 , up to @xmath95 mev .",
    "however , it is sufficiently small that its line - shape can not be determined with any precision from slice fits .",
    "the contribution from @xmath150 is small .",
    "there are however two difficulties with trying to analyse the data in slices .",
    "the first is that the only available information is a differential cross - section .",
    "this does not allow independent determinations of amplitude and phase .",
    "a related difficulty is that there are complex interferences between @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 in @xmath20 data and likewise in @xmath136 data between @xmath32 , @xmath9 and @xmath6 , @xmath151 . in the absence of any strong interferometer in the data with known quantum numbers ,",
    "the slice analysis can not sort out these interferences .",
    "this leaves no choice but to relate magnitudes and phases through breit - wigner amplitudes fitted directly to the data .",
    "partial waves which are tried are @xmath3 , ( orbital angular momentum @xmath152 in the production process @xmath153 ) , @xmath149 ( @xmath154 ) , @xmath155 ( @xmath152 ) and @xmath156 @xmath157 ) . of these",

    "decay channels which are considered are @xmath6 , @xmath30 , @xmath9 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "there is an immediate question how @xmath57 and @xmath28 should be parametrised . in @xmath161 and @xmath29 elastic scattering , there are adler zeros which suppress the amplitudes strongly near threshold .",
    "this is well understood in terms of chiral symmetry breaking , which creates the adler zeros . however , in many sets of data , it is established that @xmath57 and @xmath28 appear as low mass peaks .",
    "the origin of this effect is straightforward .",
    "if the elastic amplitude is written as @xmath162 , the denominator must be universal .",
    "however , the numerator can be quite different in elastic scattering and production reactions .",
    "bes ii data for @xmath163 @xcite may be fitted accurately with @xmath164 a constant .",
    "this is also true for bes data on @xmath165 , where there is again a low mass peak in the @xmath29 s - wave due to the @xmath28 pole @xcite .",
    "the present work uses the @xmath28 amplitude fitted in ref .",
    "@xcite to lass data for elastic scattering @xcite , bes ii , and e791 data .",
    "a problem is that it is not yet fully understood why or how the adler zero disappears from the numerator of the amplitude in some production processes . in principle",
    ", there could be contributions with a numerator @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are complex constants",
    ". however , this unfortunately leads to large destructive interferences between the two terms .",
    "this is a well known symptom of over - fitting the data , so final fits must choose between @xmath57 and @xmath28 poles or alternatively amplitudes the same as for elastic scattering .",
    "empirically , the present @xmath169 data give a considerably better fit ( by 46 in log likelihood ) with the @xmath28 pole amplitude , i.e. a constant numerator @xmath164 .",
    "[ log likelihood is defined here so that it changes by 0.5 for a one standard deviation change in the fit ] .",

    "this fit is better than one using the @xmath161 elastic scattering amplitude by 16 in log likelihood .",
    "fits to present data are almost identical using the formula for the @xmath57 of zou and bugg @xcite or a recent formula fitted to the @xmath57 pole @xcite .",
    "the first formula is simpler and is used here .",
    "both @xmath57 and @xmath28 are fitted using a constant for @xmath164 .",
    "the fit to data is made using 200k monte carlo events for @xmath170 and @xmath171k for @xmath1 to simulate detector acceptance .",

    "all figures show experimental results uncorrected for acceptance .",
    "these corrections are included automatically into the log likelihood fit .",
    "the acceptance varies only slowly across figures .",
    "a technical detail is that partial wave amplitudes are written in terms of relativisic tensors ; explicit formulae are given in @xcite .",
    "in @xmath37 radiative decays , an important point is that the dominant production process is expected to be via intermediate @xmath172 . because of the high mass of these quarks and the interaction of the photon at a point ,",
    "the production process is expected to be almost pointlike .",
    "data on @xmath173 in the accompanying paper verify this @xcite .",

    "if the @xmath36 is included in the fit , its contribution is small and will be discussed in section 7 .",

    "the result from @xmath37 data does not suffer from these systematic problems .",
    "note that the line - shapes fitted to present data are perturbed by the slowly varying factor @xmath175 for production with @xmath308 ; this factor and the associated form factor have been included in the fit and the arithmetic of branching ratios .",
    "one should also note that the signal assigned by obelix to the @xmath136 channel is not visible as a peak in the data , but is obtained from the difference in the line - shape of the @xmath241 signal from a breit - wigner of constant width fitted to @xmath47 .",
    "a further detail is that the phases of individual decay channels are affected by multiple scattering with other components of the fit .",
    "they may differ from one production process to another . as a result , it is difficult to give a definitive result for the branching ratio between @xmath136 and @xmath20 .",
    "the reality of the situation is that there is major flexibility in the magnitudes of contribution which can be fitted to @xmath11 in @xmath20 channels . in the data presented here ,",
    "there is flexibility in what can be fitted to the broad interfering component .",
    "this flexibility is apparent from the fact that fits with a single @xmath11 or separate @xmath309 and @xmath13 differ very little in log likelihood .",
    "there is yet further flexibility if the @xmath7 channel receives additional contributions proportional to the @xmath161 elastic amplitude .",
    "-16 mm    in @xmath20 data shown in fig . 7 , the broad @xmath40 signal in fig .",
    "7(b ) obviously fails to explain fully the @xmath20 signal above 1600 mev .",
    "the @xmath210 threshold may contribute something to the drop above 1870 mev , but alone does not fit the high mass spectrum .",
    "the remedy adopted here is to fit a resonance form as an expedient , although there is no phase information , hence no definite evidence for a resonance .",
    "the optimum fitted mass and width are @xmath310 mev , @xmath311 mev .",
    "the strongest decays are to @xmath6 , but there is also a rather strong decay to @xmath10 .",
    "16 show mass projections from @xmath20 dalitz plots on to @xmath161 and @xmath186 mass .",
    "the @xmath53 is clearly visible in fig .",
    "16(g ) at 1 gev . in figs .",
    "16(h ) , there is a a small but definite @xmath89 peak .",
    "it does not fit naturally to decays of @xmath312 and/or @xmath313 .",
    "it is of roughly the right magnitude to originate from @xmath83 background .",
    "the @xmath314 signal from this background is also just visible in fig .",
    ".    on the upper side of the 1850 mev peak is a small @xmath155 component , which may be fitted with @xmath312 . when this contribution is omitted from the fit , log likelihood gets worse by 84 .",
    "the relative intensities in @xmath6 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath315 decays are fixed to accurate values from crystal barrel data @xcite .",
    "production phases , attached to each amplitude in the isobar model , are fitted freely .",
    "so there are five fitted parameters .",
    "statistically , the significance of the @xmath155 component is 10 standard deviations , despite the signal being small .",
    "the reason for this significance is that amplitudes have a distinctive angular dependence which is readily identified . for completeness ,",
    "a contribution is also included for @xmath316 .",
    "it is much smaller and barely significant . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is suggested that @xmath316 is a standard @xmath317 state , the isospin partner to @xmath318 ; @xmath312 is interpreted as a hybrid .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the observations here .",
    "the production of a hybrid is naturally explained in terms of @xmath319 , followed by conversion of one gluon @xmath320 to @xmath317 .",
    "the bes collaboration has presented evidence for an @xmath49 in @xmath48 with a production branching fraction @xmath321 \\times 10 ^{-4}$ ] and a width of 68 mev @xcite .",
    "there is no obvious signal in @xmath66 data of fig .",
    "7 , although the fit to data is slightly ragged in this mass range .    a free fit including it with published mass and width gives 189 @xmath221 events , 94 @xmath6 , 164 @xmath7 and 86 @xmath159 .",
    "log likelihood improves by 58 for 8 additional fitting parameters .",
    "there is flexibility in the fit , and the total number of events can be increased from 533 to 1182 if log likelihood is allowed to get worse by 2 for every channel , corresponding to an overall 4 standard deviation change .",
    "this is a cautious limit taking account of the fact that the components fitting this mass range are uncertain .",
    "the corresponding branching fraction is @xmath322 .",
    "no statement can be made about its possible coupling to @xmath136 , since the mass range of the present data extends only to 1800 mev .",
    "huang and zhu @xcite point out that its mass , total width , production rate and decay pattern favour its assignment as the second radial excitation of @xmath39 .",
    "more precisely , the small branching fraction in @xmath20 favours a mixing angle between @xmath323 and @xmath324 close to that of the @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath325 , @xmath11 and @xmath49 would then form a regge trajectory with a spacing in @xmath326 of @xmath327 gev@xmath328 , close to that of other well establshed trajectories @xcite .",
    "the peak observed by bes2 at 2240 mev in @xmath211 would fit naturally as the fourth member of this sequence @xcite .",
    "however , resonant phase variation needs to be established for @xmath329 and the @xmath211 peak .",
    "ma @xcite tries to interpret @xmath330 as a baryonium state associated with the threshold peak observed in @xmath25 in bes data @xcite .",
    "this interpretation leads to a decay stronger to @xmath20 than @xmath48 , and is clearly ruled out by the present data .",
    "if there is just one @xmath11 in the mass range 14001500 mev , it either has a large su(3 ) singlet @xmath317 component or a glueball component .",
    "either would explain its strong production in @xmath2 radiative decays , where @xmath331 appear in a singlet combination .",
    "it could likewise be produced strongly in @xmath25 annihilation .",
    "however the @xmath14 channel is su3 octet , so the @xmath11 ( or @xmath13 ) can not be purely singlet .",
    "it is well known that isolated @xmath259 states such as @xmath332 are produced weakly in @xmath25 annihilation .",
    "if the @xmath13 is to be produced strongly in @xmath25 annihilation , it should have a substantial @xmath323 component , but that is inconsistent with decays purely to @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath12 decays much more strongly to @xmath288 and @xmath10 than to @xmath7 + @xmath6 .",
    "this would not arise naturally if it is a pure @xmath323 state .",
    "so the conclusion is that a substantial @xmath259 ( or gluball ) component must be present in @xmath11 or @xmath333 .",
    "the existence of @xmath36 depends primarily on data in three papers on @xmath334 and one on @xmath335 @xcite . in this process",
    ", there should be a clear distinction between @xmath36 which decays via the s - wave and @xmath17 which decays via the p - wave .",
    "if production is limited to a single exchange process , these are immediately distinguishable . in @xmath25 annihilation",
    "the situation is much more complex , since there are four combinations of @xmath20 produced in every event @xcite , making the separation between @xmath36 and @xmath17 much more difficult .",
    "those reviews which argue against the existence of @xmath36 base their arguments on the fact that there could be more than one exchange mechanism in @xmath336 production data , leading to possible confusion between the flat angular distribution from @xmath36 and rank 2 processes involving @xmath17 .",
    "it is unfortunate that the papers of primary importance published on @xmath36 do not give quantitative estimates of its significance .",
    "if the data still survive , it would be valuable if the groups concerned would publish values of log likelihood or @xmath113 showing quantitatively how their fit changes when the @xmath36 is omitted .",
    "this information would sharpen the arguments for or against @xmath36 .    in the data presented here ,",
    "most of the peak near 1285 mev certainly is due to @xmath17 ; a free fit including @xmath36 improves log likelihood only by 3.7 for four parameters fitted to magnitudes and phases of decay amplitudes to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "seven events are fitted to @xmath36 compared with 230 to @xmath17 .",
    "so the evidence for @xmath36 in present data is not significant .",
    "is the @xmath11 really split into two components ?",
    "although fit a optimises @xmath12 at 1429 mev , a persistent feature of data fitted to @xmath12 in other analyses is a mass 1405 mev in @xmath20 and 1414 mev in @xmath9 .",
    "as shown in section 5.3 , data from @xmath25 annihilation require corrections to these masses for the phase space in the production process .",
    "this shifts the mass fitted to @xmath20 data up by 4.7 mev and that in @xmath136 data by 9.7 mev .",
    "weighting these with the intensities fitted to @xmath20 and @xmath9 in table 2 , the mean mass of @xmath12 becomes 1421 mev .",
    "there is then a discrepancy in mass of @xmath337 mev with the mass in fit a with a single resonance .",
    "this is not convincing evidence for two separate resonances near 1440 mev .",
    "however , it must be said that one can not move the @xmath11 much below 1439 mev without a poor fit to the peak in @xmath136 . how could the difference of 18 mev be explained between @xmath20 data and @xmath187 ?",
    "klempt @xcite has pointed out a possible explanation .",
    "a radial excitation has a node in its wave function causing a zero in decays to @xmath249 in this general mass range .",
    "firstly this attenuates the @xmath20 signal and may explain why it is weaker than @xmath9 and @xmath32 . secondly , such a node introduces a further @xmath5-dependence into @xmath20 .",
    "suppose the amplitude for the @xmath249 channel is multiplied by a factor @xmath338 , where @xmath339 is the location of the zero in the amplitude .",
    "a resonance at 1439 mev can have a peak at 1410 mev if there is a zero in the amplitude at 1.47 gev , just where there is a dip in the @xmath224 mass spectrum , fig .",
    "however , the peak is attenuated more on its upper side than its lower side and the peak is somewhat asymmetric .",
    "tests on the present data show that this explanation does cure the 10 mev discrepancy between @xmath20 data and the fit near 1500 mev . however , a factor 10 higher statistics are needed to test the idea precisely . it can not be tested in @xmath25 annihilation because of the four different charge combinations .",
    "zeros would appear at different masses in @xmath7 and @xmath9 , depending on matrix elements , leading to a potentially complicated line - shape with peaks at different masses in different channels .",
    "there is one further possible complication .",
    "the dominant decay of @xmath11 is through @xmath136 .",
    "there is inevitably some rescattering of @xmath187 through @xmath88 to the @xmath20 channel via what are called triangle graphs .",
    "this was discussed in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . it will have the effect of increasing the @xmath136 decay branching fraction of @xmath11 .",
    "let us turn to @xmath244 . the general pattern of the broad components in the @xmath20 mass projection of fig .",
    "7 is that there are two components peaking at 1890 and 1600 mev .",
    "it is possible that the latter is resonant . in the @xmath141 data there is evidence for a resonance at 1970 mev with a width of 210 mev .",
    "if the parameters of @xmath244 are changed to those values , log likelihood for @xmath20 data is worse by 42 .",
    "this is a modest amount , in view of the systematic uncertainties about how to fit the @xmath20 mass range above 1600 mev and the strong @xmath210 threshold nearby .",
    "it is therefore possible that these two signals arise from the same resonance , though this can not be proved at the moment .",
    "consider next @xmath16 and @xmath18 . in fig .",
    "8(a ) , one sees that the effect of @xmath18 is to produce a slight bump at 1490 mev and extend the tail of @xmath16 .",
    "longacre @xcite has suggested that @xmath16 may be an abnormal state ( or ` molecule ' in current terminology ) with an @xmath238 pion orbiting a @xmath187 s - wave combination . in this picture , there are final state interactions from two combinations of @xmath31 and a further final - state interaction between the two s - wave kaons .",
    "my suggestion is that these final state interactions enhance this state strongly at the lowest @xmath187 masses , but the rapid rise of the @xmath32 phase space with momentum produces a long tail extending into the mass region of what is called @xmath18 .",
    "it must be said in favour of the data of aston et al . that they identified the @xmath340 @xmath341 state and it was subsequently confirmed by crystal barrel data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is a @xmath342 peak in their data which they did not claim as a resonance , but was subsequently identified as a resonance by crystal barrel @xcite and confirmed by wa102 @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that the data of aston et al .",
    "appear reliable .",
    "the primary question is one of interpretation of their @xmath343 signal .",
    "they did not include @xmath16 in their fit .",
    "so it is possible that the @xmath16 has a more extended line - shape than has previously been fitted .",
    "the main experimental results are the observation of three peaks in the @xmath20 mass spectrum : a narrow peak at 1415 mev , a shoulder at 1550 mev and a broad peak at @xmath344 mev . in @xmath136",
    ", there is an asymmetric peak at @xmath139 mev .",
    "the asymmetry is due to the @xmath5-dependence of the @xmath32 channel ; its dalitz plot immediately identifies a dominant @xmath32 decay .",
    "the intensity for that decay increases rapidly from its threshold at @xmath345 mev as @xmath34 , where @xmath33 is the momentum of decay @xmath60 and @xmath31 in the @xmath14 rest frame .      when analysing @xmath25 data , it is necessary to allow for the variation of phase space for production of @xmath20 and @xmath9 with mass .",
    "this corrects the mass of @xmath12 upwards by 4.7 mev in @xmath20 and by 9.7 mev in @xmath9 . as a result ,",
    "the mean mass difference between the possible @xmath12 and @xmath346 is no larger than @xmath347 mev .",
    "there is a dominant broad @xmath40 amplitude in @xmath20 .",
    "when this is included into the partial wave fit , interference with a single @xmath11 can account naturally for the observed peaks at 1415 mev in @xmath20 and at 1450 mev in @xmath136 .",
    "there is no evidence for two separate @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the present data .",
    "the @xmath329 is not observed in the present @xmath20 data , and an upper limit has been derived for the branching fraction for its production in @xmath37 decays .",
    "this limit is a factor @xmath348 smaller than the @xmath329 observed in the @xmath48 channel .",
    "the natural explanation is that @xmath329 is a radial excitation of @xmath39 and @xmath11 .    as an aid to further work",
    ", the fully annotated fortran code for the broad @xmath40 component and @xmath11 is available from the author .",
    "this code includes numerical values of @xmath223 from the present work , but they would need to be re - optimised if further data become available .",
