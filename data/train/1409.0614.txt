    "superconductivity in fe - based superconductors ( fescs ) has been studied intensively due to the relatively large transition temperatures @xmath9 up to 55  k ,  @xcite a high upper critical field , and a layered structure similar to the cuprates .",
    "superconductivity emerges when the magnetic order is suppressed by charge doping or by applying an external pressure , and takes place within feas , fep , or fese crystallographic planes .",
    "these planes are separated by layers of other elements serving as a charge reservoirs . among the very few members of this fescs class becoming superconducting at ambient pressure and without doping , we find the iron selenide , fese .",
    "this compound has the simplest crystal structure and stoichiometry , while keeping a moderate superconducting critical temperature of about 8k for polycrystalline samples .",
    "@xcite furthermore , high - quality single crystals with rather large dimensions can be grown ,  @xcite which are necessary for an accurate determination of bulk physical properties . interestingly ,",
    "if the tetragonal fese system is submitted to a pressure of 8.9gpa , a huge enhancement of the @xmath9 up to 36.7k is obtained .",
    "@xcite this system also stands out due to the absence of nesting between hole and electron pockets of the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite in addition , density functional calculations of the electronic structure indicate that the electron - phonon coupling can not explain superconductivity at such a high transition temperature .",
    "@xcite therefore , fese falls in the category of unconventional superconductivity and appears as an ideal candidate to study the fundamental properties of superconductivity in clean iron based superconductors .",
    "one of the crucial issues to elucidate the mechanism leading to high - temperature superconductivity is the nature of pairing , e.g. , the symmetry and structure of the superconducting order parameter . up to now , there have been several investigations on the pairing symmetry of fese superconductors .",
    "thermal conductivity measurements  @xcite show the absence of nodes in the superconducting gap .",
    "furthermore , recent upper critical field studies of @xmath10- fese crystals have revealed that two - band effects dominate @xmath11 , with possible influence of a spin paramagnetic effect .",
    "@xcite the presence of both an isotropic @xmath5-wave and extended @xmath5-wave order parameters coexisting in a superconducting single - crystal fese has also been proposed based on specific - heat measurements .",
    "@xcite very recently , multiple andreev reflections spectroscopy pointed to the existence of two - gap superconductivity .",
    "@xcite in addition , muon spin rotation studies of the penetration depth @xmath12 in fese@xmath13 were consistent with either two - gap @xmath14 or anisotropic @xmath5-wave order parameter symmetries , thus implying that the superconducting energy gap contains no nodes .",
    "@xcite in contrast to that , scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments in the stoichiometric fese provided clear evidence for nodal superconductivity .",
    "@xcite the observed gap function was attributed to an extended @xmath5-wave pairing structure with the mixture of @xmath15 and @xmath16 pairing symmetries .",
    "@xcite clearly , today there is no general consensus on the origin of superconducting pairing mechanism in fese compounds and further measurements to elucidate this issue are necessary .    the lower critical field , @xmath0 i.e. the thermodynamic field at which the presence of vortices into the sample becomes energetically favorable , and the magnetic penetration depth , @xmath17 , are very useful parameters providing key information regarding bulk thermodynamic properties .",
    "indeed , the gap properties of different families of fescs have been investigated by tracking the @xmath3(t ) and the magnetic penetration depth .",
    "@xcitethe gap properties of these compounds display single to double gaps and even the presence of nodes .",
    "this variety of gap properties appears to be related to the nature and the level of doping .",
    "it should be mentioned that this quest for new multiband superconductivity is a timely subject due to the possible emergence of non - monotonic vortex - vortex interactions , fingerprint of so - called type 1.5 superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    the main motivation of the present work is to tackle a long standing question concerning whether the superconducting properties of these materials can be accounted for a nodal order parameter or not . to that end",
    ", we reliably determined the temperature dependence of the @xmath3 from magnetization measurements .",
    "we then compare the most popular approach of determining the first vortex penetration as the point of deviation from a linear @xmath18 response , to the value obtained from the onset of the trapped magnetic moment ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "although this latter approach to determine @xmath0 has been performed in detail in high-@xmath9 superconductors , i.e. , yba@xmath20cu@xmath21o@xmath22 as reported in ref .",
    ", its application to fe - based superconductors has not been presented so far .",
    "in particular , our results show that the method of the trapped magnetization onset is more sensitive than the method determined from the point of deviation from a linear @xmath18 response . in addition",
    ", a kink around 7k is obtained on the @xmath0 curve , which can be accounted for by the multi - band nature of superconductivity in this system .",
    "our analysis further shows that the superconducting gaps determined through fittings to the in - plane london penetration depth can not be described with the single - band weak - coupling bcs scheme ; rather , it implies the presence of either two @xmath5-wave - like gaps with different magnitudes and contributions or a single anisotropic s - wave gap .",
    "our london penetration depth results are contrasted to values obtained through the more sophisticated technique of muon - spin rotation .",

    "the zfc data for both orientations show a sharp diamagnetic signal , thus confirming bulk superconductivity in our investigated system .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a superconducting transition with an onset transition temperature @xmath40 of 9.4k for both orientations .",
    "the clear irreversibility between fc and zfc measurements is consequence of a strong vortex trapping mechanism , either by surface barriers or bulk pinning .",

    "a similar behavior has been observed in conventional as well as fe - based superconductors .",

    "these sort of measurements are obtained by tracking the virgin @xmath18 curve at low fields at several temperatures , as shown in the upper panel of fig.2 for @xmath25 .",

    "@xcite in contrast to method-@xmath68 where a heavy data post - processing is needed , now a careful measurement protocol needs to be followed with little data analysis .",

    "the field @xmath69 at which @xmath19 deviates from zero determines the @xmath3 value at the desired temperature .",

    "alternatively , in order to shed light on the pairing symmetry in our system , we determined the temperature dependence of the magnetic london penetration depth ( @xmath80 ) applied along the @xmath2 axis by using the following formula ( taking the demagnetization effect into account ) : @xmath81@xmath82 , where @xmath83@xmath84 is the magnetic - flux quantum and @xmath83@xmath84 = @xmath85 = 2.07 x 10@xmath86oe cm@xmath34 , @xmath87 = @xmath80/@xmath88 = 72.3 ( ref .  ) is the ginzburg - landau parameter .",
