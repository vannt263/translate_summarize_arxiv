    "concerns further symmetry properties of lift zonoids , their probabilistic characterisation and financial implications .",

    "for instance , the lift zonoids of the log - normal distribution in the risk - neutral setting ( see figure  [ fi : liftzonoids ] ) are line symmetric , which implies the put - call symmetry ( or bates rule ) for the black - scholes economy .",

    "section  [ sec : mult - symm ] characterises random vectors that possess symmetry properties generalising the classical put - call symmetry for basket options and options on the maximum of several assets . the symmetry ( or self - duality )",

    "relationships between the self - duality property and the swap - invariance in margrabe type options have been studied in  @xcite . in currency markets ,",

    "the overall symmetry implies that expected payoffs from basket options are symmetric with respect to the weights of particular assets and the strike price .",
    "we show that symmetries for some vanilla type options ( like bates rule in the univariate case ) imply a certain symmetry for _ every _ integrable payoff function . after discussing some fundamental results , we characterise the multivariate log - infinitely divisible distributions , exhibiting the multivariate put - call symmetry .",
    "the new effect in the multivariate setting is that independence of asset prices prevents them from being jointly self - dual . in other words , symmetry properties for several assets enforce certain dependency structure between them , which is explored in this paper .    in order to extend the application range of the self - duality property and also in view of incorporating the carrying costs",
    ", we then define _ quasi - self - dual _ random vectors and characterise their distributions .",
    "these random vectors become self - dual if their components are normalised by constants ( representing carrying costs ) and raised to a certain power .",
    "the related power transformation was used in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we establish an explicit relationship between carrying costs and the required power of transformation for rather general price models based on lvy processes .",
    "these results are then used in section  [ sec : symm - distr ] to obtain several new results for self - dual random variables thereby complementing the results from @xcite . in particular ,",
    "self - dual random variables have been characterised in terms of their distribution functions ; it is shown that self - dual random variables always have non - negative skewness and several examples of self - dual random variables are given .",
    "as in the univariate case also in the multiasset case there are various applications of symmetry results . first , symmetry results may be used for validating models or analysing market data , e.g.similarly as in  @xcite and  @xcite in the univariate case .",
    "furthermore , they could be used for deriving certain investment strategies , see e.g.section  [ sec : semi - static - super ] .",
    "the probably most important application will potentially be found in the area of hedging , especially in developing _ semi - static _ replicating strategies of multiasset barrier and possibly also more complicated path - dependent contracts . following carr and lee  @xcite ,",
    "semi - static hedging is the replication of contracts by trading european - style claims at no more than two times after inception . as far as the relevance of this application",
    "is concerned we should mention that there has been a liquid market in structured products , particularly in europe . at the moment the majority of the trades is still over - the - counter , but more and more trades are also organised at exchanges , especially at the quite new european exchange for structured products scoach . structured products often involve equity indices , sometimes several purpose - built shares , and quite often have barriers .",
    "hence , developing robust hedging strategies for multi - asset path - dependent products seems to be of a certain importance . in the univariate case , carr et al .",
    "@xcite and several other authors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) developed a machinery for replicating barrier contracts having fundamental relevance for other path - dependent contracts .",
    "section  [ sec : ex - apl - self - dual ] contains first applications of the multivariate symmetry properties , especially for hedging complex barrier options , thereby extending results from @xcite and @xcite for some multiasset options .",

    "the maturity time @xmath7 is supposed to be the same for all instruments .",
    "one of the most basic relationships between options in arbitrage - free markets is the european _ call - put parity_. in case of deterministic dividends , this parity can be expressed by @xmath84    recall that @xmath11 is defined by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the asset price at maturity and @xmath82 is the forward price .",

    "<S> for instance , the european call - put parity corresponds to the central symmetry property , while the concept of dual markets can be explained by reflection with respect to a plane . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the classical univariate log - normal model belongs to a large class of distributions with an extra property , analytically known as put - call symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> the financial meaning of this extension is explained , the asset price distributions that have this property are characterised and their further properties explored . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown how to relate some multivariate asymmetric distributions to symmetric ones by a power transformation that is useful to adjust for carrying costs . </S>",
