    "non - relativistic quantum fluids ( fermions or bosons ) constrained by periodic structures , such as layered or tubular , are found in many real or man - made physical systems .",
    "for example , we find electrons in layered structures such as cuprate high temperature superconductors or semiconductor superlattices , or in tubular structures like organo - metalic superconductors . on the experimental side",
    ", there are a lot of experiments around bosonic gases in low dimensions , such as : bec in 2d hydrogen atoms @xcite , 2d bosonic clouds of rubidium @xcite , superfluidity in 2d @xmath1he films @xcite , while for in 1d we have the confinement of sodium @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "meanwhile , for non - interacting fermions there are only a few experiments , for example , interferometry probes which have led to observe bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "to describe the behavior of fermion and boson gases inside this symmetries , several works have been published . for a review of a boson gas in optical lattices",
    "see @xcite , and for fermions @xcite is very complete . most of this theoretical works use parabolic @xcite , sinusoidal @xcite and biparabolic @xcite potentials , with good results only in the low particle energy limit , where the tight - binding approximation is valid .",
    "although in most of the articles mentioned above the interactions between particles and the periodic constrictions are taken simultaneously in the system description , the complexity of the many - body problem leads to only an approximate solution .",
    "so that the effects of interactions and constrictions in the properties of the system , are mixed and indistinguishable .",
    "in this work we are interested in analyzing the effect of the structure on the properties of the quantum gases regardless of the effect of the interactions between the elements of the gas , which we do as precisely as the accuracy of the machines allows us to do .",
    "this paper unfolds as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we describe our model which consists of quantum particles gas in an infinitely large box where we introduce layers of null width separated by intervals of periodicity @xmath2 . in sec .",
    "3 we obtain the grand potential for a boson and for a fermion gas either inside a multilayer or a multitube structure . from these grand potentials we calculate the chemical potential and specific heat , which are compared with the properties of the infinite ideal gas . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss results , and give our conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath3 non - interacting particles , either fermions or bosons , with mass @xmath4 for bosons or @xmath5 for fermions respectively , within layers or tubes of separation @xmath6 , @xmath7 = @xmath8 or @xmath9 , and width @xmath10 , which we model as periodic arrays of delta potentials either in the @xmath11-direction and free in the other two directions for planes , and two perpendicular delta potentials in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions and free in the @xmath11 one for tubes .",
    "the procedure used here is described in detail in refs . @xcite and @xcite for a boson gas , where we model walls in all the constrained directions using dirac comb  potentials . in every case ,",
    "the schrdinger equation for the particles is separable in @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 so that the single - particle energy as a function of the momentum @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "for the directions where the particles move freely we have the customary dispertion relation @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and we are assuming periodic boundary conditions in a box of size @xmath17 .",
    "meanwhile , in the constrained directions , @xmath11 for planes and @xmath18 for tubes , the energies are implicitly obtained through the transcendental equation @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 represents the layer impenetrability in terms of the strength of the delta potential @xmath22 .",
    "we redefine @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the thermal wave length of an ideal gas inside an infinite box , with @xmath25 the fermi energy and @xmath26 is the density of the gas .    the energy solution of eq .",

    "it is useful to split the infinite integrals into an number @xmath38 of integrals running over the energy bands , taking @xmath38 as large as necessary to acquire convergence .      for a gas inside a multilayer structure , the particle number @xmath3 is directly obtained from eqs . ( [ omegaboson ] ) and ( [ omegafermion ] ) .",
    "important characteristics can be extracted , such as the critical temperature for a condensating boson gas and the influence of the system parameters on it , @xmath2 and @xmath39 , already reported in refs .",
    "but for the case of a fermion gas , we focus on the chemical potential since it is closely related to the fermi energy of the system . in this case",

    "another important feature is the chemical potential of the system over its fermi energy , @xmath45 as a function of the temperature in units of the fermi temperature @xmath46 , fig [ muvst ] , for a given value of @xmath47 .",
    "there is a special interest in fig [ muvst ] , since for certain geometrical configurations the chemical potential shows an anomalous behavior , as will be shown later .",
    "also , in this last figure one may notice that for @xmath48 the 3d ifg behavior for the chemical potential is recovered , and that the curve crosses the @xmath8 axis in @xmath49 , as has been reported in @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , as @xmath50 , we have a fermion gas inside a two dimension structure , giving a zero chemical potential at @xmath51 , as expected .     for planes with @xmath52 and different values of @xmath44 .",

    "we make a similar procedure for the boson an fermi gases inside a multitube structure , the first one being reported in @xcite .",
    "but for a fermion gas we start from the equation @xmath54\\bigr\\ }   \\label{fermtubos}\\ ] ] and extract the chemical potential over the fermi energy of the system , @xmath45 , which is probably the feature that attracts greater attention due to its anomalous behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ muvsttubos ] , which shows up as an unexpected small hump .",
    "another interesting characteristic is that the chemical potential over the ifg fermi energy in every case is lifted as @xmath39 increases due to the presence of the layers , in the same way as the chemical potential of the boson gas started above zero .",
    "the _ specific heat _ of a boson gas has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where we can observe a transition from a 3d system to a 2d one , which becomes evident for certain parameter values and sufficiently high temperatures . at this point is where the advantages of summing over a great amount of allowed energy bands shows its relevance .",

    "it may be observed that , as the barriers disappear ( @xmath48 ) , one recovers the ifg specific heat classical value , @xmath58 .",
    "it is also noticeable that as the value of @xmath59 diminishes , a dimensional crossover signature from 3d to 2d becomes evident , since the the first minimum ( going from right to left ) in the specific heat deepens towards a value @xmath60 and broadens as @xmath39 increases . in fig .",
    "[ cvtubos ] the dimensional crossover from 3d to 1d is very noticeable as the mentioned minimum drops down to the value @xmath61 which corresponds to one - dimension .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the thermodynamic properties of ideal boson and fermion gases inside periodical structures . in our model",
    "the multilayers and multitubes are generated with dirac - comb potentials in either one or two directions , while the particles are free in the remaining directions .",
    "just by introducing the planes , the translational symmetry of the particles is broken .",
    "this fact reflects in every thermodynamic property of the constrained system .",
    "in particular , fermions in multi - tubes progress from a 3d behavior to that 2d and finally to 1d as the wall impenetrability is increased , which is observed in the curves of the specific heat as a function of temperature .",
    "there is a critical value of the wall impenetrability for which the system begins to behave in dimensions less than two , which is signaled by the appearance of an anomalous chemical potential .",
    "bosons in multitubes show similar dimensional crossover like that expressed by fermions , in addition to the bose - einstein condensation at temperatures below the critical temperature of a ideal bose - gas with the same particle density . +",
