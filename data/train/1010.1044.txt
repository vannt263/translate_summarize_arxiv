    "tse and wang @xcite showed that the han - kobayashi scheme can in fact achieve to within one bit of the capacity region for the two - user gaussian interference channel for all channel parameters .",
    "their key insight was that the interference - to - noise ratio ( inr ) of the private message should be chosen to be as close to @xmath4 as possible in the han - kobayashi scheme .",
    "they also found a new capacity region outer bound using a genie - aided technique . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we refer this particular setting of the private message power as the etkin - tse - wang ( etw ) power - splitting strategy .",
    "the etkin , tse and wang s result applies only to the two - user interference channel .",
    "practical systems often have more than two transmitter - receiver pairs , yet the generalization of etkin , tse and wang s work to the interference channels with more than two users has proved difficult for the following reasons .",
    "first , it appears that the han - kobayashi common - private superposition coding is no longer adequate for the @xmath0-user interference channel .",
    "interference alignment types of coding scheme @xcite @xcite can potentially enlarge the achievable rate region .",
    "second , even within the han - kobayashi framework , when more than two receivers are involved , multiple common messages at each transmitter may be needed , making the optimization of the resulting rate region difficult .    in the context of @xmath0-user gaussian interference channels , sum capacity results are available in the noisy interference regime @xcite",
    ". in particular , annapureddy et al .",
    "@xcite obtained the sum capacity for the symmetric three - user gaussian interference channel , the one - to - many , and the many - to - one gaussian interference channels under the noisy interference criterion .",
    "similarly , shang et al .",
    "@xcite studied the fully connected @xmath0-user gaussian interference channel and showed that treating interference as noise at the receiver is sum - capacity achieving when the transmit power and the cross channel gains are sufficiently weak to satisfy a certain criterion .",
    "further , achievability and outer bounds for the three - user interference channel have also been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , much work has been carried out on the generalized degree of freedom ( gdof as defined in @xcite ) of the @xmath0-user interference channel and its variations @xcite .",

    "the main objective of this paper is to show that it indeed achieves to within a constant gap of the capacity region for this cyclic model in the weak interference regime to be defined later .",
    "the cyclic interference channel model is motivated by the so - called modified wyner model , which describes the soft handoff scenario of a cellular network @xcite .",

    "if one assumes that the mobile terminals always communicate with the intended base - station to their left ( or right ) , while only suffering from interference due to the base - station to their right ( or left ) , one arrives at the @xmath0-user cyclic gaussian interference channel studied in this paper .",
    "the modified wyner model has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite , but often either with interference treated as noise or with the assumption of full base - station cooperation .",

    "a capacity region outer bound is then obtained .",
    "it is shown that with the etkin , tse and wang s coding strategy , one can achieve to within @xmath3 bits of the capacity region when @xmath5 ( with time - sharing ) , and to within two bits of the capacity region in general in the weak interference regime .",

    "<S> this paper studies the capacity region of a @xmath0-user cyclic gaussian interference channel , where the @xmath1th user interferes with only the @xmath2th user ( mod @xmath0 ) in the network . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the work of etkin , tse and wang , who derived a capacity region outer bound for the two - user gaussian interference channel and proved that a simple han - kobayashi power splitting scheme can achieve to within one bit of the capacity region for all values of channel parameters , this paper shows that a similar strategy also achieves the capacity region of the @xmath0-user cyclic interference channel to within a constant gap in the weak interference regime . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for the @xmath0-user cyclic gaussian interference channel , a compact representation of the han - kobayashi achievable rate region using fourier - motzkin elimination is first derived , a capacity region outer bound is then established . it is shown that the etkin - tse - wang power splitting strategy gives a constant gap of at most 2 bits in the weak interference regime . </S>",
    "<S> for the special 3-user case , this gap can be sharpened to @xmath3 bits by time - sharing of several different strategies . </S>",
    "<S> the capacity result of the @xmath0-user cyclic gaussian interference channel in the strong interference regime is also given . </S>",
    "<S> further , based on the capacity results , this paper studies the generalized degrees of freedom ( gdof ) of the symmetric cyclic interference channel . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the gdof of the symmetric capacity is the same as that of the classic two - user interference channel , no matter how many users are in the network .    </S>",
