    "single and dilepton probes in heavy ion collisions are of particular interest since such probes , once produced , are largely unaffected by the surrounding qcd medium .",
    "they carry valuable information on the particle from which they originate and allow one to assess the properties of the medium formed in the early instants of the collision .",
    "the following contributions to the dilepton invariant mass spectrum are discussed here , together with what one might learn from their measurement about the properties of the medium formed in the collision :    * low mass dileptons originating from vector meson leptonic decay ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) provide insight on the properties of these mesons in the high temperature expanding fireball produced immediately after the collision , where chiral symmetry may be ( at least partially ) restored  @xcite ; * a significant fraction of the virtual and direct photons produced at low @xmath5 ( @xmath6  gev / c ) in heavy ion collisions originates from the thermal black - body radiation of the created fireball  @xcite .",
    "measuring these photons therefore allows one to quantify the temperature of the fireball ; * open heavy flavors , because of their high mass , allow one to study in - medium energy loss mechanisms in addition to what can be learned from light quarks  @xcite ; * heavy quarkonia are of interest because of additional mechanisms that are predicted to occur in the presence of a qgp and that would affect the production of these bound states  @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ low_mass_vector_mesons ] ( left ) shows the correlated dimuons invariant mass distribution at the @xmath2 vacuum mass , measured by the na60 experiment in semi - central in+in collisions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 mass peak differs significantly from the expected vacuum @xmath2 and can be reasonably well described on the low mass side by the model presented in  @xcite .",
    "this model includes a detailed description of the baryonic matter created in the collision below the formation temperature of a qgp , @xmath7 .",
    "interactions with this baryonic matter are responsible for a broadening of the @xmath2 ( but no modification of its mass ) when approaching chiral symmetry restoration near @xmath8 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in short :    * low mass vector mesons exhibit strong shape modifications with respect to their vacuum properties , that can be well described at sps but not at rhic possibly because some contributions to the dilepton spectrum have not been properly accounted for ; * virtual photons can be used in addition to direct photon measurements to assess the medium temperature averaged over its expansion time and derive its initial temperature ; * a significant suppression of @xmath9 quarks is necessary to describe the observed heavy flavor @xmath10 in a way that is consistent with the b / b+d ratio measured in @xmath11 collisions ; * @xmath12 production in heavy - ion collisions is a puzzle .",
    "the situation is more complex than the original picture , due to our poor knowledge of its production mechanism in @xmath11 collisions and to the existence of many cold nuclear matter effects which significantly modify this production even in the absence of a qgp .",
    "efforts are being made to better understand the above so that one can quantify the _ hot _ , abnormal effects at both sps and rhic .",
    "notably , it appears that the suppression measured at sps in in - in collisions can be entirely described in terms of such cold nuclear matter effects .    00 pisarski r d 1982 , _ phys .",
