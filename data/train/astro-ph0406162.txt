    "line emissions below and above the kev region have been observed in many compact star sources .",
    "it is intriguing to note that often their frequencies are multiples of each other - showing a harmonic origin .",
    "it is well known that such harmonic vibrations are seen in large nuclei and are called breathing mode oscillations whose origin is the compressional modes of surface vibrations . to see such behaviour in a compact star , it should have a sharp surface and the star should be self bound with pressure p = 0 at the surface . for such criterion , it is required that the star be described by an equation of state ( eos ) which has a minimum value of e / a at a non - zero density , where e is the binding energy and a is the baryon number .",
    "all of the existing neutron star eoss have surface density zero , while for most of the strange star eoss have the feature of sharp surface . besides the existing mit bag model eoss for strange matter ( farhi & jaffe , 1984 ; haensel et al . , 1986 ; alcock et al . , 1987 , etc",
    ", dey et al .",
    "( 1998)(henceforth , d98 ) gave an eos for strange matter and used it to model strange stars having such property .",
    "another strange star model having such phenomena is by malheiro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where they have the feature of sharp surface .",
    "we shall use the d98 model in our further discussions and shall consider only the eos1 in d98 which is the same as the ss1 in li et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the resonance absorption in 1e  1207.4@xmath35209 and rx  j1856.5@xmath33754 can be plausibly interpreted as being due to surface vibrations in strange stars ( sinha et al .",
    ", 2003 - henceforth called as sddrb ) . in particular",
    ", the former star shows evidence of 4 harmonics ( bignami et al .",
    "2003 ) and has been studied extensively by xmm - newton making it the most deeply scrutinized galactic target of the mission ( de luca et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the presence of the vibrational frequencies we discuss , is related to surface compressional modes and it is only possible if ( uds ) quark matter is self - bound as for example in d98 .",
    "there can not be harmonic compressional modes in neutron stars because of the lack of a minimum in the e / a of its eos which results in the absence of a sharp surface .",
    "the direct estimate of the mass - radius relation of the compact stars are still far from accuracy and depends on a lot of _ assumptions _ , like the surface temperature , luminosity , distance estimates , etc . with the size of the conventional neutron stars being slightly more than the more exotic strange stars , and they themselves being so far away , it is hardly possible to make any distinction between the two .",
    "ambiguities arise in the estimates of these objects even with the most modern satellites and telescopes .",
    "a particular example is the recently debated object rx  j1856.5@xmath33754 .",
    "drake et al . (",
    "2002 ) claimed it to be a strange star , while at the same time walter and lattimer ( 2002 ) showed that if they assumed the surface temperature of 33 ev , instead of 61.2 ev as taken by drake et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , then it gives a mass - radius relation , perfectly consistent with the normal neutron stars .",
    "so , to bypass these kind of uncertainties and debates , an alternative signature is desperately sought in order to prove the existence of the strange stars .",
    "the estimates of the surface vibrations for the strange stars ( for the d98 model , which is a realistic model of uds quark confinement and asymptotic freedom ) has recently been studied by sinha et al .",
    "their predictions of the emissions from the bare strange stars , due to this effect , astonishingly match with the line emissions from certain candidates .    in the next section we talk about the radial breathing mode oscillation problem . in section 3",
    "we discuss our results and remark on relevant observations . in the last section we conclude and summarize .",
    "the u and d quarks are believed to be light ( 4 and 7 @xmath5 respectively ) and the strange quark s , moderately light ( 150 @xmath5 ) at very high density , whereas in hadrons they have a mass of roughly one third of the hadron mass .",
    "one therefore thinks of a chiral symmetry restoration as one moves from low to high density .",
    "when this is included along with a debye screening for gluon propagation , a model may be described as a realistic one for exploring the possibility of a high density strange quark phase comprising of @xmath6 quarks . considering the above mentioned properties",
    ", d98 developed their model for strange quark matter and strange star .",
    "the eos1 of d98 has a minimum of energy per baryon ( e / a ) at a surface density of 4.586 times the normal nuclear matter density , where the pressure @xmath7 , and this surface can vibrate .",
    "the spectrum of the vibration frequency @xmath8 is controlled by @xmath9 and is harmonic so frequencies @xmath10 are expected to occur for @xmath11 .",
    "we recall the relevant formulae for breathing surface oscillations in sddrb to calculate the mass , once the fundamental frequency of vibration is known .",
    "we get the corresponding radius of the star from the solutions of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkof ( tov ) equation for the star given in d98 and li et al .",
    "( 1999a & 1999b ) .    in d98 model , the energy per particle has a minimum at the surface .",
    "the nature of the curve near the minimum can be approximated by the potential of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "a taylor expansion of the energy about @xmath12 gives    @xmath13    where r is the star radius , @xmath14 and    @xmath15    is the tov equation with conventional notation .",
    "the frequency of the vibration is given by    @xmath16    where the mass of the skin ( @xmath17 ) is in energy units .",
    "the @xmath17 is estimated to be very small ( sddrb ) .",
    "the very small depth of the surface @xmath18 must be larger than the effective diameter of the ud quarks @xmath19 : @xmath20 .    for the extreme case when the equality sign holds , which means",
    "the layer is just one diameter thick , we can replace @xmath19 by @xmath18 .",
    "this yields an estimate of the maxwellian mean free path :    @xmath21    where the surface density @xmath22 for ss1 with @xmath23 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath24 is clearly macroscopic .",
    "it shows the onset of asymptotic freedom even at the surface of the strange star .    in terms of this @xmath18    @xmath25    @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath5 for ss1 at the star surface .",
    "mark that this shows chiral symmetry restoration is setting in already at the surface of the star , being much more prominent at the centre where the density is 15 @xmath28 or 46.85 @xmath29 .",
    "due to strong interaction binding , the strange star surface is very firm and the portion that can oscillate symmetrically is thin , typically a one quark layer as we have discussed above .",
    "the star mass and radius are given in figs .",
    "( [ oscl ] & [ oscl2 ] ) for the relevant value of the breathing resonance line .",
    "below we discuss the evidence for the line emissions from various stars  :    1 .",
    "4u  0614@xmath2091 is a moderately bright x - ray source .",
    "three emission lines at around 0.65 , 0.86 , and 1.31 @xmath1 are proposed by schulz ( 1999 ) .",
    "this would correspond to a mass of about @xmath30 with radius 7.02 km .",
    "2s  0918@xmath3549 is a source fitted to a power law plus black body spectrum ( @xmath31 @xmath1 ) with a @xmath32 and shows a residual at 0.8 @xmath1 with width 55 @xmath0 . including this line in the fit reduces the @xmath33 to @xmath34 schulz ( 1999 ) .",
    "we predict a mass of @xmath35 and a radius of 7.22 km .",
    "white et al . ( 1999 ) found a 0.7 @xmath1 line emission for 4u  1543@xmath3624 .",
    "juett , psaltis and chakraborty ( 2001 ) suggest that the three stars above and 4u  1850@xmath3087 with a 0.7 @xmath1 line might have extra neon in the mass donors .",
    "however as these authors point out , a few type i x - ray bursts have been reported from three of these sources : two bursts from 4u  0614@xmath2091 , one from 2s  0918@xmath3549 and three from 4u 1850@xmath3087 .",
    "this may indicate that the donors in these systems are not c - o dwarfs ( juett et al .",
    "for 0.7 @xmath1 lines , we predict a mass of 1.23 @xmath36 and a radius of 7.16 km . 5 .",
    "4u  1820@xmath330 , located in the globular cluster ngc  6625 is a binary star with period 685 sec .",
    "schulz ( 1999 ) finds two peaking lines at 0.6 and 0.9 @xmath1 which enables us to suggest its mass as @xmath37 .",
    "note that this star was predicted to be a strange star in dey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from the mass - radius curve .",
    "finally the 0.6 @xmath1 excess emission in rx  j170930.2@xmath3263927 is reported by jonker et al .",
    "we predict the mass of this star to be @xmath38 .",
    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) have long been considered one of the possible endpoints of low mass x - ray binary evolution .",
    "the star is thought to be spun up to a millisecond period by accretion from its low mass companion . in the last five years",
    "this theory has been confirmed with the identification of three accretion powered msp - s the first one being sax  j1808.4@xmath33658 which was hailed as the holy grail of x - ray pulsar astronomy by van der klis ( 2000 ) .",
    "it was suggested in li et al .",
    "( 1999a ) that this may be a strange star .",
    "the two other millisecond x - ray pulsars x1751@xmath3305 and xte  j0929@xmath3314 may also be strange stars .",
    "if so then all these three stars have a low magnetic field and low rate of accretion due to their age and they are not expected to feel strong excitations involving the entire accreting star surface like other younger strongly accreting stars . hence the absence of line spectra and qpo - s from these stars is expected .",
    "it may be recalled that electrons in strange stars are not bound by strong interaction and can stay outside the sharp star surface .",
    "a thin , negatively charged shell of about 100 fm may be formed outside the surface due to these electrons ( alcock et al . , 1986 ; alcock , 1991 ) .",
    "the stars sax  j1808.4@xmath33658 , x1751@xmath3305 and xte  j0929@xmath3314 all show highly coherent pulses whence their rotation frequencies are easily determined to be 401 , 435 and 185 hz respectively .    in trying to explain why coherent radiation are detected in the above msps",
    ", one may use the model of titarchuk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , for sax  j1808.4@xmath33658 .",
    "they suggested that the x - ray emission originates in the comptonization process in a relatively optically thin hot region .",
    "they estimated the electron density near the surface of the star to be about @xmath39 .",
    "the star radius with the maximum mass given by the tov equation for eos1 can be seen to be 7.055 km ( dey et al . , 1998 ; li et al .",
    ", 1999a & 1999b ) .",
    "@xmath5 , many of them are energetic and move away from the surface . ]",
    "if we assume the electron density to be uniform over a depth of 100 fm on top of the star surface and take the value from titarchuk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we get the number of electrons to be @xmath40 .",
    "there will a resultant positive charge z , on the star .",
    "assuming it is charge neutral @xmath41 and to the outside electron this will appear to be concentrated at the centre producing a electrostatic potential @xmath42 @xmath5 .",
    "this has to be larger than the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons at the star surface @xmath43 by a factor @xmath44 , in order that the electrons at the top of the fermi surface do not escape . using titarchuk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we find @xmath45 .",
    "a guess value of @xmath46 was used in sddrb .",
    "so the electron number expected by us is justified by the work of titarchuk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , giving more credibility to our calculations .",
    "in conclusion we point out that there are bits and pieces of evidence in support of the existence of strange stars .",
    "for example , the short range pairing of ud quarks by a few @xmath5 can provide for events parallel to fusion bursts which release about 5 @xmath5 per event . whereas the latter last typically for only 10 seconds",
    "- the pairing can go on for hours ( minutes ) after a star has suffered prolonged accretion and all ( some of ) the pairs are broken .",
    "this can explain superbursts which are recurrent within 5 years as seen in 4u  1636@xmath353 .",
    "the alternate scenario involving carbon burning may work for 4u  1820@xmath330 but can not be uniformly applied to all superbursters and long bursters ( sinha et al .",
    ", 2002b ) .",
    "the absorption spectra of 1e  1207.4 - 5209 ( de luca et al .",
    "2004 ) is another case in evidence which may turn out to be a strange star showing resonance absorption ( sinha et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in summary",
    ", we point out that lines observed in many stars at more or less around 1 @xmath1 may be due to harmonic surface oscillations , if they are strange stars .",
    "we also reaffirm that the millisecond x - ray pulsars sax  j1808.4@xmath33658 may be a strange star .",
    "confirmation of the existence of strange stars would lead to a rich interplay between x - ray astrophysics and qcd .",
