    "the picture of resistive ( current - reducing ) phase slips was first discussed by little @xcite .",

    "we show that the string method can be employed as an efficient numerical tool for the study of thermally activated phase slips in thin superconducting wires below @xmath0 .",
    "the system is modeled by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation ( tdgle ) with a langevin noise term . applying the string method to this particular system",
