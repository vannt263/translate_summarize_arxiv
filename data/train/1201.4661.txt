    "since the experimental realization of graphene  @xcite , its electronic properties and their understanding have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . while the intrinsic carrier mobility of graphene is predicted to be exceptionally high , the experimental reality in substrate supported graphene involving charged impurities , electron - hole puddles , surface - optical phonons of the substrate , and disorder",
    "typically results in strongly reduced mobilities compared to the expected intrinsic value  @xcite .",
    "together with scattering on acoustic phonons which manifests itself in a linear temperature dependence of the mobility at higher temperatures , these extrinsic scattering mechanisms typically dominate the mobility .",
    "the linear temperature dependence characteristic for acoustic phonon scattering has so far been observed in both supported  @xcite and suspended  @xcite graphene samples .    with the recent improvements in sample fabrication , the relative role of acoustic phonon scattering",
    "must be expected to become increasingly important in future devices .",
    "for example , samples with the commonly used sio@xmath7 substrate replaced by hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) which has a lattice constant very close to that of graphene and an almost atomically flat surface with strongly reduced disorder  @xcite , have shown highly improved transport characteristics with mobilities approaching that of suspended graphene  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high energy of the surface - optical phonons of h - bn results in a significant reduction of surface - optical phonon scattering  @xcite that for commonly used gate oxides starts to dominate the mobility around @xmath8  k  @xcite .    when the mobility is dominated by acoustic phonon scattering , two transport regimes separated by the bloch - grneisen ( bg ) temperature @xmath9 can be identified  @xcite . here",

    "since the bg temperature corresponds to the acoustic phonon energy @xmath17 for full backscattering at the fermi level , short wavelength acoustic phonons are frozen out at temperatures @xmath18 restricting scattering processes to small scattering angles .",
    "the restricted phase space available for phonon scattering at @xmath18 results in a transition from the linear @xmath19 behavior of the resistivity in the high - temperature regime to a stronger @xmath20 temperature dependence in the bg regime where @xmath5 ( @xmath21 ) in the absence ( presence ) of screening by the carriers themselves  @xcite .",
    "the bg behavior in the temperature dependence of the mobility ( resistivity ) has recently been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "existing theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies of acoustic phonon - limited transport in graphene often parametrize the interaction with acoustic phonons in terms of a coupling to a single _ effective _ acoustic phonon .",
    "the associated deformation potential coupling constant extracted from the experimentally measured temperature dependence of the resistivity range from @xmath22  ev  @xcite . on the other hand , theoretical studies of the acoustic electron - phonon coupling yield much lower values on the order of @xmath23  ev  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", different forms of the coupling matrix element are used in theoretical studies  @xcite making a direct comparison of the different values of the deformation potential difficult .    even though the effect of acoustic phonon scattering on the carrier mobility in graphene has been studied widely in the literature  @xcite , a complete study considering the full details of the coupling matrix element is still lacking .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to provide a detailed analysis of the acoustic electron - phonon interaction in graphene and to establish the intrinsic value of the effective deformation potential",
    ". we shall focus on supported graphene where the flexural phonons are quenched and hence include only the transverse ( ta ) and longitudinal ( la ) acoustic phonons .",
    "we use a first - principles method to calculate the electron - phonon interaction  @xcite supported by the group - theoretical considerations of ref .  .",
    "we then study the intrinsic phonon - limited mobility using a boltzmann equation approach in the temperature regime @xmath0  k and for high carrier densities @xmath24  @xmath2 where screening by the carriers suppresses other scattering mechanisms . using the full coupling matrix elements",
    ", we find that a temperature dependence with @xmath25 occurs even in the absence of screening .",
    "in the following , the carriers in graphene are described by massless dirac fermions with linear dispersion @xmath26 where @xmath27  m / s is the fermi velocity . within the boltzmann equation approach  @xcite , the mobility in graphene in the presence of ( quasi ) elastic scattering mechanisms is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the conductivity , @xmath15 is the two - dimensional carrier density and the density - of - states averaged relaxation time ( in units of time per energy ) is defined by @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the density of states of the graphene layer and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the spin and valley degeneracies , respectively . at low temperatures and high carrier densities where @xmath34 this yields @xmath35 .    in the case of acoustic phonon scattering which can be treated as a quasielastic process",
    ", the relaxation time for each of the acoustic phonons ( ta and la ) is given by  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scattering angle and @xmath38 the fermi function .",

    "the phonons are assumed to be in equilibrium and populated according to the bose - einstein distribution function @xmath43 .",
    "as scattering on both the ta and la phonon is considered here , the total relaxation time for the @xmath44-valleys is given by the sum of the individual phonon contributions as @xmath45 . as we show in the following section , the matrix elements of the electron - phonon coupling differ in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 valleys ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] ) .",
    "the boltzmann equation must therefore be solved explicitly in both valleys . in the absence of intervalley scattering which couples the distribution functions in the two valleys ,",
    "this can be done by considering the two valleys separately . in this case , the relaxation time entering the expression for the mobility in eq .",
    "becomes the valley - averaged relaxation time @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total relaxation time in the individual valleys .",
    "screening of the electron - phonon interaction by the carriers themselves  @xcite has been considered elsewhere  @xcite and will here be neglected .    while analytic considerations have been given in refs .",
    ", we will in the present work resort to a numerical evaluation  @xcite of the relaxation time in eqs .   and  .",
    "this allows us to study the acoustic phonon - limited mobility in graphene with the full coupling matrix elements which have a more complex angular dependence than most often assumed ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the numerical approach also allows for a unified treatment of the high - temperature ( @xmath50 ) and bloch - grneisen ( @xmath18 ) regimes .",
    "we note , however , that in the low - temperature regime where @xmath51 , it is crucial that the phonon energy is retained in the fermi function in eq .  .",
    "in the high - temperature regime this requirement can be relaxed and the relaxation time can be put on a simple analytic form .",
    "in the following we use a first - principles dft approach based on a fully microscopic description of both the electronic bloch states and the phonons to calculate the acoustic electron - phonon couplings in graphene  @xcite .",
    "the calculated values for the sound velocities @xmath52 for the ta and la phonons are reported in table  [ tab : parameters ] together with other parameters used in this work . due to their high phonon energies ( @xmath53  mev ) , acoustic intervalley and optical phonons",
    "do not play a role in the considered temperature range and can therefore be neglected .    the interaction between charge carriers and the acoustic phonons in graphene",

    "the exponent increases monotonically .",
    "surprisingly , the exponents obtained from the mobility calculated with the full coupling matrix elements do not saturate at @xmath5 as predicted by the _ effective _ coupling matrix element ( dashed lines )  @xcite .",
    "thus , even in the absence of screening , the mobility of graphene should take on a temperature dependence with @xmath25 at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "with carrier screening taken into account , this behavior is reinforced  @xcite    the purely intrinsic mobilities calculated here are significantly higher than previously reported theoretical values  @xcite .",

    "such an extremely large mean - free path may open the opportunity to study coherent transport in relatively large graphene structures .",
    "we note that the quasiparticle scattering rate observable in photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) develops a similar dip at the fermi level for @xmath18 resulting in long - lived quasiparticles .",
    "in the present study the acoustic electron - phonon interaction in graphene has been analyzed in detail .",
    "the exact analytic forms of the coupling matrix elements in long - wavelength limit were found match the calculated first - principles matrix elements almost quantitatively even at shorter wavelengths . as previously predicted  @xcite , the calculated mobilities showed a transition from a @xmath95 to a @xmath107 temperature dependence with @xmath97 below the bg temperature .",
    "however , contrary to earlier studies we found that the full coupling matrix elements cause the temperature dependence of the mobility to increase beyond @xmath5 which is otherwise only observed when screening is included  @xcite .    by fitting the results with",
    "an _ effective _ acoustic phonon the acoustic deformation potential is found to be @xmath83  ev .",
    "since this is much lower than the experimentally determined values @xmath6  ev , our results suggest that the acoustic phonon - limited transport in substrate - supported graphene is at present not fully understood .",
    "possible explanations for the large experimental deformation potentials could be ( i ) substrate - induced modifications of the band structure  @xcite that modifies the chirality ( and thereby the angular dependence of the coupling matrix element ) of the electronic states and/or the fermi velocity , and ( ii ) the existence of additional acoustic phonons not considered in the present work",
    ". this could be either the intrinsic flexural phonon which may be modified when graphene is lying on a substrate or surface - acoustic phonons on the substrate which have previously been studied in 2degs  @xcite .",
