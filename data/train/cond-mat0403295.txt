    "each integer number  @xmath0 can be written in a unique way as the product of prime numbers  @xmath1 with integer multiplicities @xmath2 , @xmath3 every other possibility to decompose  @xmath0 into integer factors larger than  @xmath4 is obtained by multiplying out some of its prime factors . for @xmath5 , for instance , we have the factorisations @xmath6 it is understood that the ordering of the factors does not matter here , so that @xmath7 is not distinguished from @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the number of such factorisations of  @xmath0 which contain exactly @xmath10  factors , and let  @xmath11 be the total number of factorisations . then , according to the above list , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , giving a total of  @xmath15 factorisations .",
    "it is obvious that the number @xmath11 of possible factorisations of  @xmath0 does not only depend on the total number of prime factors of  @xmath0 , but also on the multiplicities with which the different prime factors occur : taking @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 so that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , adding up to @xmath21 . since two of the three prime factors of  @xmath16 are equal , the number of different combinations of prime factors is less than for @xmath5 , which possesses three different prime factors .",
    "we therefore divide the natural numbers into equivalence classes : two numbers @xmath22 and @xmath23 are said to be equivalent if they give rise to the same pattern of factorisations , meaning that @xmath24 for all  @xmath10 .",
    "particular equivalence classes consist of numbers which are some power of a single prime  @xmath25 : if @xmath26 , or @xmath27 for some integer  @xmath28 , the task of factorising  @xmath0 is equivalent to the task of partitioning the exponent  @xmath28 into integer summands , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the famous number - partitioning problem _ partitio numerorum _ introduced by euler  @xcite .",
    "this problem , which in itself plays a significant role in several areas of modern mathematics  @xcite , is connected to a number of topics occuring in statistical physics , ranging from lattice animals  @xcite and combinatorial optimisation  @xcite over fermion - boson transmutation  @xcite to quantum entropy and energy currents flowing in a one - dimensional channel connecting thermal reservoirs  @xcite .    in the general case , taking the logarithm of the prime factor decomposition  ( [ pfd ] ) yields @xmath29 seen from the viewpoint of statistical physics , this latter equation allows for an interesting interpretation : if we consider an ideal bose gas consisting of sufficiently many particles , confined such that the single - particle energies @xmath30 , when suitably made dimensionless , are given by the logarithms of the primes , @xmath31 with @xmath32 for @xmath33 , the equation  ( [ log ] ) indicates one particular microstate of the system , where the total energy @xmath34 is distributed among the particles in such a way that @xmath2 is the occupation number of the energy level  @xmath35 .",
    "additional particles which are not excited remain in the ground state , forming a bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "such surplus particles do not contribute to the energy , since @xmath36 .",
    "ideal bose gases with a single - particle spectrum corresponding to the sequence of the logarithms of the prime numbers have recently been studied by tran and bhaduri  @xcite , with particular emphasis placed on differences between the fluctuation of the number of condensate particles in different statistical ensembles .    a few remarks concerning low - dimensional , ideal bose ",
    "einstein condensates might appear in order .",
    "the example of an ideal bose gas of @xmath37 particles in a one - dimensional harmonic potential with oscillator frequency @xmath38 captures the essentials : if one considers the usual thermodynamic limit , meaning @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that the product @xmath41 remains constant , the bose ",
    "einstein condensation temperature approaches zero  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the relevant limit here ; we rather have to consider the limit of large particle numbers at _ constant _ oscillator frequency . in this case",
    "there still exists a nonzero characteristic temperature @xmath42 for the onset of a macroscopically large occupation of the ground state , roughly given by @xmath43 , which approaches infinity for @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "thus , there exists a condensate for any finite temperature , if the particle number is sufficiently large .",
    "since we wish to treat _ all _ possible factorisations ( not only those into primes ) of a given number  @xmath0 without regard to the order of the factors , the bose - gas analogy requires the single - particle spectrum @xmath44 we point out that such a spectrum might actually be realisable : as shown in the appendix  [ ap : log ] , within the quasi - classical approximation the eigenvalues of a particle in a one - dimensional logarithmic potential @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 , up to a constant ; the restriction to odd numbers @xmath47 is not essential .",
    "the key point here is that the analogy between the factorisation problem and an ideal bose gas with logarithmic single - particle spectrum allows us to invoke well - established methods from statistical physics for obtaining information on number - theoretical properties of large composite integers . in this paper , we focus on the probability distribution @xmath48 for given ( asymptotically ) large integers  @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ , on the probability of finding  @xmath10 factors in a randomly selected factorisation of a large  @xmath0 .",
    "we will proceed as follows : in section  [ sec : rec ] we state recursion relations required for the numerical evaluation of the exact quantities @xmath9 , deferring the derivation to appendix  [ ap : rec ] .",
    "we then briefly explain in section  [ sec : asi ] the method used to obtain , by means of a detour from the microcanonical to the canonical ensemble and back , asymptotic expressions for the cumulants of the distributions  ( [ dis ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the two extreme kinds of equivalence classes , namely those made up of powers of a single prime on the one hand , and those consisting of products of different primes on the other , and state the respective asymptotic formulas for the cumulants in sections  [ sec : asi ] and  [ sec : asii ] . in this way",
    ", an interesting feature will become apparent : while the presence of identical prime factors in the first case introduces bose - like correlations which prevent the distributions  ( [ dis ] ) from becoming gaussian even in the asymptotic limit , large products of different primes do indeed lead to almost gaussian distributions .",
    "the paper closes with a brief summary in section  [ sec : dis ] .    in passing , we point out that the problem considered in this paper should be clearly distinguished from a similar problem known as _ factorisatio numerorum _ , first investigated by kalmr  @xcite . in this latter connection one",
    "counts all _ ordered _ sequences ( @xmath49 ) of integers @xmath50 which yield  @xmath0 when multiplied , @xmath51 . denoting the number of such ordered sequences by @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 ) , one deduces @xmath54^{-1 } $ ] , where @xmath55 is riemann s zeta function ; the task then is to find the asymptotic behaviour of the sum function @xmath56 recent results , and further information on this problem , have been collected in ref .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper we do _ not _ count different orderings of factors as different configurations , or microstates .",
    "it is precisely this identification of different orderings which leads to the bose - gas analogy ( with bosons , the question `` which particle occupies which state '' is meaningless ) , and thus opens up the avenue followed here .",
    "in order to determine the exact distributions  ( [ dis ] ) , we employ a recursion relation : let @xmath57 be the number of factorisations of @xmath0 into  @xmath10 or less factors .",
    "then , as shown in appendix  [ ap : rec ] , one has @xmath58 contributions to the second sum in equation  ( [ eq : recpro ] ) arise only when @xmath59 divides @xmath0 . starting from  @xmath60 ,",
    "the sequence @xmath61 increases with increasing  @xmath10 ( unless @xmath0 happens to be a prime ) until it reaches its final value @xmath11 , since  @xmath0 can not be expressed as a product of more than  @xmath62 integer factors greater than  @xmath4 : @xmath63    figure  [ fig : omega ] shows a logarithmic plot of @xmath11 for @xmath64 . each data point",
    "@xmath65 $ ] has been marked by an individual dot ; the equivalence classes clearly manifest themselves as horizontal lines .",
    "while these data might suggest an upper bound on @xmath11 on the order of @xmath66 , the reader should be warned that the true asymptocis are not reached for @xmath0 as small as @xmath67 ; a correct upper bound will be stated later .    the number of possibilities to factorise  @xmath0 into exactly  @xmath10 factors is now given by @xmath68 so that we have access to the probability distribution  ( [ dis ] ) .",
    "as in previous investigations of ground - state fluctuations of non - interacting and weakly interacting bose gases  @xcite , it is useful to characterise such a distribution in terms of its cumulants  @xmath69  @xcite , which directly quantify its deviation from a gaussian : for a gaussian distribution , @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the lowest four cumulants are related to the mean value @xmath72 and the central moments @xmath73 through the relations  @xcite @xmath74 normalising the third and the fourth cumulant we respect to the second , one obtains the skewness @xmath75 which characterises the asymmetry of the underlying probability distribution , and the excess @xmath76 which characterises its flatness .    in figure",
    "[ fig : skew ] we display exact data for the skewness  @xmath77 of the distributions  ( [ dis ] ) , revealing that their asymmetry becomes particularly large when @xmath78 .",
    "it is clear that all numbers within the same equivalence class yield the same cumulants , and thus the same values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "since the general algorithm  ( [ eq : recpro ] ) requires rather a large amount of computer memory , it pays to focus on particular equivalence classes : for numbers  @xmath0 which are powers of a prime  @xmath25 , @xmath81 one has @xmath82 this recursion relation still has to be solved numerically .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath0 is a product of distinct primes , @xmath83 the probability distribution is given by the relation @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "as explained in appendix  [ ap : an ] , this relation even admits a closed solution : @xmath87",
    "the problem of finding all factorisations of a given number @xmath0 corresponds , within the bose - gas analogy , to a problem of microcanonical statistics : given the total energy @xmath34 , the task is to find all possible microstates , _",
    "i.e. _ , all possibilities for distributing the energy over the available single - particle levels @xmath30 . particles which are not excited and thus remain in the condensate contribute with @xmath88 to the energy , or with a factor of  @xmath4 to the product .",
    "hence , the picture to have in mind is that of a partially condensed bose gas , with the excited particles corresponding to factors larger than @xmath4 , and a sufficiently large supply of condensed particles in the ground state .",
    "while the _ microcanonical _ requirement to keep the total energy constant introduces severe technical difficulties , the statistics of partially condensed ideal bose gases become much simpler in the _ canonical _ ensemble , where the system is kept in contact with a thermal reservoir of temperature  @xmath89 .",
    "it is precisely at this point that the bose - gas picture becomes essential : one can obtain information about the microcanonical number factorisation problem by invoking the notion of temperature .",
    "we employ the first energy gap @xmath90 to introduce the dimensionless inverse temperature @xmath91 where @xmath92 , as usual . a decisive role for the canonical statistics of a partially condensed",
    ", ideal bose gas is played by the grand canonical partition function @xmath93 of an auxiliary system from which the single - particle ground state @xmath94 has been removed , while all other levels @xmath30 remain unaltered .",
    "if there is an infinite supply of condensed particles , in the spirit of the so - called maxwell s demon ensemble  @xcite , this function has the exact integral representation  @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the familiar bose functions  @xcite , and @xmath97 is a series determined by the single - particle spectrum . the real number @xmath98 in equation  ( [ lnx ] ) is chosen such that all poles of the integrand lie on the left hand side of the path of integration .",
    "the value of this representation  ( [ lnx ] ) , and of the subsequent representation  ( [ eq : cancum ] ) , lies in the fact that it lends itself to the derivation of an asymptotic series which captures the low-@xmath99-behaviour , if one collects , from right to left on the real axis , the residues of the respective integrands . with respect to an actual bose gas ,",
    "the underlying assumption of an infinite number of ground - state particles restricts the validity of equation  ( [ lnx ] ) to temperatures low enough to guarantee the existence of a condensate . in the case of the number factorisation problem",
    "there is no similar restriction , owing to the fact that multiplying any product by an arbitrary amount of factors of unity does not change its value : in the number - theoretic context the representation  ( [ lnx ] ) is",
    "_ exact_.    the @xmath100-th cumulants @xmath101 of the canonical distribution governing the number of excited particles in the gas are then immediately obtained by differentiation , @xmath102 giving  @xcite @xmath103 where  @xmath104 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "we will only consider non - interacting bosons in trapping potentials with single particle energy levels  @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) such that the series  ( [ eq : etadef ] ) converges for @xmath107 , with some real @xmath108 .",
    "the strategy of employing the canonical ensemble for solving a microcanonical problem hinges on the possibility to get rid of the temperature in a second step , and to find an expression for the microcanonical cumulants .",
    "this is done with the help of the saddle - point method  @xcite : the `` energy - temperature '' relation reads @xmath109 where  @xmath110 denotes the energy in units of @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is the saddle point .",
    "the generating function of the microcanonical cumulants then takes the form  @xcite @xmath113 and the desired microcanonical cumulants are finally calculated by taking derivatives , @xmath114    the method sketched here requires knowledge about the analytical properties of the function  @xmath115 introduced in equation  ( [ eq : etadef ] ) . for applications to the number factorisation problem ,",
    "the single - particle energies are determined by the equivalence class of the number  @xmath0 : in the simplest case  ( [ ty1 ] ) , the possible single - particle energies are integer multiples of @xmath116 , so that @xmath115 coincides with the riemann zeta function @xmath117 , and the factorisation of  @xmath0 is equivalent to the partition of @xmath118 into summands .",
    "the evaluation of the above formalism for the partition problem has already been discussed in detail  @xcite , so we merely quote the results : for numbers of the type  ( [ ty1 ] ) , the asymptotic formula for the skewness  ( [ eq : skewdef ] ) reads @xmath119 ^ 2           - 0.37376 \\ , \\ln(\\log_p(n ) ) - 1.7078 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\     & + & \\frac{1}{\\log_p(n)}\\left [ 0.0075008 \\left[\\ln(\\log_p(n))\\right]^4           + 0.025681 \\left[\\ln(\\log_p(n))\\right]^3 \\right .",

    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "it is also visible that both @xmath121 and @xmath122 approach constant values only for numbers  @xmath0 of the order  @xmath123 .",
    "the finding that the limiting values of skewness and excess are nonzero expresses the fact that for numbers of the form  ( [ ty1 ] ) the distribution  ( [ dis ] ) remains non - gaussian even for asymptotically large  @xmath0 .",

    "the maximum of the excess , @xmath126 lies at @xmath127 .",
    "we now turn to the equivalence classes consisting of products of different primes , and restrict ourselves to numbers  @xmath0 which are the product of the first @xmath28 primes , @xmath128 where @xmath28 is large . in this case , the single - particle energies accessible to the bose gas are given by @xmath129 the restriction @xmath130 stems from the fact that each prime @xmath1 does either contribute to a given factor of @xmath0 , or it does not .",
    "the task then is to characterise the analytical properties of the series @xmath115 corresponding to this spectrum .",
    "we circumvent this severe difficulty by considering a simpler , but combinatorically equivalent problem : we replace the actual energy levels  ( [ ore ] ) by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a transcendental number which has to assure the `` prime '' character of @xmath133 in the sense that it be not possible to express  @xmath134 as a sum of the form  @xmath135 , for arbitrary integers @xmath2 , since a prime can not be represented as a product of arbitrary powers of lower primes , and any @xmath28 , since the function @xmath115 provided by the substitute  ( [ eq : ena ] ) acquires a contribution for each  @xmath28 .",
    "this requirement forces us to take the limit @xmath136 in the end : otherwise , there would be an infinite sequence of integers @xmath28 for which the forbidden equality @xmath137 could be satisfied with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "it is also clear that the total energy  @xmath138 has to be replaced by @xmath139 with this surrogate , we now have @xmath140 and easily obtain upper and lower bounds on the second sum , assuming  @xmath141 : @xmath142 thus , for @xmath143 we can perform the sum over  @xmath28 and obtain @xmath144 implying that @xmath115 has a simple pole at @xmath145 with a residuum  @xmath146 which can at least be estimated , @xmath147 these informations suffice for an approximate evaluation of the integral representation  ( [ eq : cancum ] ) of the canonical cumulants .",
    "we are interested in their asymptotic behaviour for small  @xmath99 , as defined in equation  ( [ deb ] ) : while the temperature has to be low enough to guarantee the existence of a bose condensate , @xmath148 has to remain large in comparison with @xmath90 , so that sufficiently many states above the ground state remain populated .",
    "now the small-@xmath99-asymptotics of the cumulants  ( [ eq : cancum ] ) are determined by the rightmost pole of the respective integrand .",
    "since @xmath149 has simple poles for @xmath150 , and @xmath151 has a simple pole at @xmath152 , the dominant pole is provided by @xmath115 at @xmath153 : taking @xmath154 close to unity , as required , results in a value of  @xmath155 larger than any fixed , finite number .    restricting ourselves to this dominant pole ,",
    "the residue theorem then yields @xmath156 with the @xmath157-sign indicating asymptotic equality .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath158 which means that the canonical distribution becomes gaussian - like for small temperatures .",
    "next , one needs the energy - temperature relation  ( [ eq : en_temp ] ) in order to return to the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "since , according to equation  ( [ kap ] ) , @xmath159 coincides with @xmath160 , to leading order this relation takes the form @xmath161 and the leading - order term of the microcanonical cumulants  ( [ mcc ] ) is given by @xmath162^c } } \\;.\\ ] ] utilising @xmath163 for @xmath164 , we then find @xmath165 as an immediate consequence , we have @xmath166 so that the approach to a gaussian is also met in the microcanonical ensemble .",

    "hence , we find @xmath168 and @xmath169 so that skewness and excess have been expressed in terms of the number  @xmath28 of primes contained in the product  ( [ pro ] ) , provided @xmath28 is sufficiently large .",

    "@xmath0 , the agreement is not quite as good as in the previous figures  [ fig : skewlarge ] and [ fig : exlarge ] .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that equations  ( [ eq : g1asn ] ) and  ( [ eq : g2asn ] ) merely stem from a leading - order analysis , as necessitated by the rather complicated function  @xmath115 underlying the  @xmath0 studied here .",
    "nonetheless , the approach to the gaussian limits @xmath177 and @xmath178 is captured correctly .",
    "we have used the correspondence between an ideal bose gas with logarithmic single - particle levels and the number factorisation problem to characterise the `` number - of - factors''-distribution  ( [ dis ] ) for large integers  @xmath0 .",
    "the properties of this distribution depend on the equivalence class of  @xmath0 , that is , on the multiplicity of its prime factors .",
    "the case  ( [ ty1 ] ) , with all the prime factors being equal , constitutes one extreme ; we have shown that for numbers of this type the skewness  ( [ eq : skewdef ] ) and the excess  ( [ eq : exdef ] ) asymptotically approach the limiting values @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "we conjecture that for _ any _ number @xmath0 , the skewness @xmath121 and the excess @xmath122 do not exceed the maximum values ( [ eq : g1max ] ) and ( [ eq : g2max ] ) adopted by numbers of this particular type :    for every integer @xmath0 , the skewness  ( [ eq : skewdef ] ) of the probability distribution  ( [ dis ] ) governing the number of factors in a randomly selected product decomposition is bounded from above by @xmath181 , while its excess  ( [ eq : exdef ] ) is bounded by @xmath182 .",
    "moreover , for a given total number of prime factors ( which equals @xmath183 for @xmath184 ) , the total number of factorisations @xmath11 becomes largest for integers  @xmath0 of the type  ( [ dpf ] ) , for which all prime factors differ from each other .",
    "upper and lower bounds on the number of factorisations for integers of this particular type have been derived in appendix  [ ap : an ] .",
    "while the lower bound clearly pertains only to the equivalence classes considered there , we conjecture that the upper bound inferred from the inequality  ( [ est ] ) holds for _ all _ large integers . again utilising the asymptotic relation  ( [ mln ] )",

    "these bounds describe the data quite well .",
    "hence , when @xmath186 , the number @xmath11 grows as  @xmath0 at least for some integers  @xmath0 , which was not obvious at all from the limited data collected in figure  [ fig : omega ] .",
    "the actual content of conjecture  [ co2 ] lies in the circumstance that it might still be possible to trade equality of prime factors for smallness of  @xmath0 : constructing some composite integer by choosing more than one prime factor equal to @xmath187 , say , certainly reduces the value of @xmath188 below the one that is attained when all prime factors are different , but also reduces the value of @xmath0 itself .",
    "in this way , one might try and maintain a relatively high value of @xmath11 , while minimising  @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the three examples singled out by the crosses in figure  [ fig : omega ] indicate that in some cases such a procedure might lead to data points which fall at least close to the envelope of all pairs @xmath65 $ ] . however , we conjecture that the bound  ( [ eq : omegabound ] ) holds nonetheless .    for powers of a single prime  @xmath25 ,",
    "the factorisation problem is equivalent to euler s number partitioning problem  @xcite , so that the asymptotics can be deduced from the hardy - ramanujan formula  @xcite for the number of partitions : @xmath189 \\sim \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3 } \\log_{p } n }     \\qquad \\mbox{for } \\quad n = p^m \\;.\\ ] ] as expected , in this case @xmath190 $ ] lies well below the conjectured upper bound  ( [ eq : omegabound ] ) . on the other hand , a strict upper bound can be established as follows : @xmath0 can not be the product of more than @xmath62 primes .",
    "assuming that these are all different ( which can only overestimate the number of factors ) , and again using the result  ( [ est ] ) , one finds @xmath189 < \\log_2(n ) \\ , \\ln[\\log_2(n ) ]     \\qquad \\mbox{for all~$n$ } \\ ; .\\ ] ] our conjectured bound  ( [ eq : omegabound ] ) is clearly stronger than this `` safe '' one .",
