    "our long - standing interest in the properties of very wide binaries and their process of dissociation led us to search for additional common proper motions ( cpm ) companions to the primaries of our catalogue of wide binaries in the solar neighborhood ( poveda et al .",
    "other authors have searched for cpm companions to nearby stars ( e.g. lepine & shara 2002 , lepine & bongiorno 2007 , chaname & gould 2004 , makarov et al .",
    "2008 , scholz et al . 2008 ) but these searches have usually set rather stringent criteria for the acceptable separations and proper motion differences , in order to eliminate , as far as possible , optical companions . for our purpose",
    "we set upper limits to the separations of @xmath1 , to the difference of the proper motions of @xmath2  yr@xmath3 , and to the difference of the position angles of less than @xmath4 .",
    "these limits would appear at first sight to be too generous , but we will discuss below some additional criteria to establish the physical nature of the system gj 282ab - nltt 18149 in particular . here",
    "we note only that the extensively studied system composed of proxima centauri and @xmath5 centauri ab is believed to be a physical system ( see e.g. wertheimer & laughlin 2006 ) , despite the fact that proxima has a separation of @xmath6 from @xmath5 centauri ab , and a difference in the proper motion of @xmath7  yr@xmath3 .",
    "our search produced a handful of interesting systems . in this paper , we concentrate on gj 282ab - nltt 18149 , probably the most remarkable one . for the sake of conciseness we shall refer to this system as gj 282 abc .",
    "the distant companion , nltt 18149 , has a separation from gj 282a of @xmath8 and a difference of proper motion @xmath9",
    "we will show that all three components of this system have very similar hipparcos parallaxes , radial velocities and ages , which , together , constitute strong evidence in favor of gj 282abc being a physical system .",

    "1994 ) having @xmath18 and a parallax in hipparcos ( 155 primaries ) , we searched for common proper motion companions in the revised nltt ( salim & gould 2003 ) , looking only at stars within a sphere of 22 pc centered on the sun , in order to be consistent with the distance limit of our 1994 catalogue . the magnitude limit ( @xmath18 )",
    "was taken because we showed that our 1994 catalogue is complete up to a distance of 22 pc for primaries brighter than this magnitude .",
    "we searched for cpm companions within a circle of @xmath1 radius centered on each primary of our catalogue , differing in proper motion by less than @xmath19  yr@xmath3 and in position angle by less than @xmath4 ( @xmath20  yr@xmath3 , @xmath21 . ) .",
    "note that the errors in the proper motions of the revised nltt stars are of the order of 8 to 10 mas yr@xmath3 .",
    "this would suggest that in order to find physical pairs one ought to take proper motion differences of this order .",
    "however , such stringent limits would cause us to miss interesting systems , in which for instance one component ( or indeed both ) is an unrecognized astrometric binary , which would introduce a `` spurious '' proper motion difference ( due to orbital motion ) . also , taking a proper motion difference of a few mas yr@xmath3 will cause us to miss some of the most interesting , widest , bound systems ( e.g. proxima centauri , which has a proper motion difference of 110 mas  yr@xmath3 from alpha centauri ab ) , or systems caught just in the process of dynamical disintegration ( rodrguez et al . 2005 ; gmez et al . 2005 , 2008 ; allen et al .",
    "1974 ; allen et al . 2006 ; snchez et al . 2008 ) . therefore",
    ", taking @xmath22 mas  yr@xmath3 seems to be an adequate compromise to discover good candidates to wide cpm systems , whose physical association would need to be confirmed by additional criteria .",
    "our search revealed several distant companions to binaries .",
    "one of the most interesting cases is the system gj 282 ab - nltt 18149 ( gj 282abc ) , having @xmath23  yr@xmath3 , @xmath24 , @xmath8 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "since we take rather generous upper limits for the separations and proper motion differences it is important to show that the putative cpm companions we find are not optical . in the case of gj 282ab and",
    "nltt 1814 we proceeded as follows .",
    "the data for the parallaxes of gj 282ab and nltt 18149 given in the hipparcos catalogue are the following :    @xmath25        these parallaxes are so similar that they allow us to reject the possibility of nltt 18149 being an optical companion to gj 282ab .",
    "indeed , from the differences of the hipparcos parallaxes ( and their quoted errors ) we estimate that the `` depth '' of the system gj 282ab - nltt 18149 ) is at most 25 000 au . this is less than the projected separation of gj 282 ab - c , which is 55 285 au , or about 0.25 pc , so we take the latter as the radius of a sphere and calculate the expected number of stars contained in this volume , using the number density determined from the luminosity function by reid , gizis and hawley ( 2002 ) , namely , @xmath26 stars per cubic parsec .",
    "the expected number of stars ( which could be optical companions ) within this sphere is 0.0072 .",
    "next , from the frequency distribution of @xmath27 for a representative sample of the nltt stars chosen at random we found the probability p(@xmath28 ) = 0.05 .",
    "the probability of the proper motion vectors of gj 282a ( @xmath29 ) and nltt 18149 differing by less than @xmath4 in position angle is less than @xmath30 , assuming the distribution of position angles to be uniform . to check this assumption",
    "we computed the position angles of the proper motion vectors of all the rnltt stars situated in an area of 400 square degrees around gj 282a ( 141 stars ) .",
    "of these , 30 have position angles between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , our estimate of the probability of the proper motion vectors differing by less than @xmath4 has to be increased to @xmath33 .",
    "then , the the probability for one primary from our catalogue to have an optical nltt companion satisfying these restrictions can be calculated to be @xmath34 , and thus the expected number of opticals ( satisfying the above conditions ) associated to the 155 systems with @xmath35 in our catalogue is about 0.01 . in this manner ,",
    "the similarity of the parallaxes and proper motions of the three components allows us to practically exclude the possibility of nltt 18149 being an optical companion to gj 282ab",
    "the system gj 282abc was observed in 2008 january 19 with the echelle spectrograph at the f/7.5 cassegrain focus of the 2.1 m telescope of the observatorio astrnomico nacional at san pedro mrtir , b.c .",

    "component a was observed twice , with exposure times of 130 and 300 s each ; for component b we obtained a single 600 s exposure , and for component c three consecutive exposures , 900 s each .",

    "the spectrum of this star is clearly intermediate between m0.5 and m2 , probably closer to the latter type as inferred from the stronger molecular bands displayed in other spectral intervals.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to classify both components of gj 282 as well as nltt 18149 = g112 - 29 , we compared their spectra with those of the mk standard stars listed in table 2 .",
    "the latter spectra were obtained in a previous observing run ( dec .",
    "2006 ) with the same equipment , but with a slightly smaller cross - dispersor angle , yielding a spectral covarage from 3800 to 6850  . with the exception of 61 cyg",
    "a , which is contained in the list compiled by morgan & keenan ( 1973 ) , these are the k0 to m3 main - sequence standards chosen by torres - dodgen & weaver ( 1993 ) , and all of them are included in the list of standards by keenan & mcneil ( 1976 ) .",
    "the comparison was made in the spectral range spanning from 4800 to 6800  . in classifying the stars we have excluded the h@xmath5 and h@xmath40 lines , in order to avoid the possible effects of chromospheric activity , as implied by the by dra ",
    "type variability assigned to gj 282a ( = v869 mon ) .",
    "the spectrum of gj 282a is intermediate to those of the k0 and k3- standards , but closer to the latter . in this spectral range",
    "the intensity of several lines increases rapidly with decreasing temperature . in figure 2",
    "we show an illustrative portion of the spectra of components a and b , together with those of the corresponding classification standards . specially useful in this ( and later )",
    "spectral ranges is the sci @xmath41multiplet 2 line , which is not contaminated with strong lines : it is very weak at k0v then its intensity sharply increases up to the k7v range and continues to increase , but more slowly , beyond .",
    "we conclude gj 282a is a normal k2v star , in accordance with previous classifications listed in simbad .",
    "however , in the simbad header for this object a k2ve classification is given and attributed to cenarro et al .",
    "we certainly find no evidence of line emission in the entire observed spectral range for this star , and the intensities of the hydrogen absorption lines look normal for its spectral type .",

    "reid et al .",
    "( 2004 ) classified gj 282b as a k5v type star .",
    "several line ratios in our averaged spectrum of this object are very similar to those of the k7v mk standard .",
    "the strength of the above mentioned sci line implies a slightly hotter star , but other line ratios favor a somewhat later type ( see figure 2 ) . with an uncertainty of 1 spectral subdivision",
    ", we estimate that gj 282b is a k6.5v normal star .",
    "the h@xmath5 line is moderately weaker in gj 282b than in 61 cyg b , while the relative intensities of h@xmath40 to neighboring metalic lines are very similar in both stars , so there was little , if any , chromospheric activity in the object during its observation .",
    "the averaged spectrum of nltt 18149 = g 112 - 29 is intermediate between those of gj 172 ( m0.5v ) and gj 15a ( m2v ) .",
    "the tio and mgh molecular bands clearly point towards a slightly hotter star than the m2v standard , in accordance with several line ratios sensitive to temperature in that spectral type range .",
    "in addition , h@xmath5 presents a weak , double - peaked emission ; the peaks are separated by about @xmath45   and the wavelength of the central trough that nearly reaches the neighboring continuum level is consistent with that at the rest frame of the star .",
    "h@xmath40 is also weakly ( but clearly ) in emission , its width being larger than the instrumental profile , probably due to unresolved structure .",
    "h@xmath46 and h@xmath47 ( with very poor s / n ratio )",
    "both appear as very narow emission lines .",
    "hence , we classify this star as an m1.5ve star with a small uncertainty ( 0.5 of a spectral subdivision ) .",
    "our classification results are given in table 1 .",
    "accurate radial velocities for five of the standards listed in table 2 have been obtained by nordstroem et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the coravel system . in order to check for self consistency or possible small variations in the velocities published for these five stars , we first cross - correlated the spectrum of each one with that of the other four , in the @xmath48 5132 - 5802   spectral range , adopting the velocities published by those authors , and using the iraf _ fxcor _ task .",
    "the resulting average velocities were in good agreement with the published ones , except for that obtained for gj 105a , which was found to be @xmath49 km  s@xmath3 ( standard deviation of the velocity as obtained from the four template stars ) slightly but significantly smaller than the published value . when the exercise was repeated , now substituting the velocity of gj 105a with the one we obtained , the average radial velocities of the other four spectral standards differed by less than 0.3 km  s@xmath3 from the published values , with a @xmath50 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "these five stars constitute the reference system against which we cross - correlated the spectra of gj 282 a , b and c , using the radial velocities listed in the last column of table 2 and the spectral range mentioned above .",
    "the resulting velocities do not show any dependence on the spectral type of the template stars , though the formal errors yielded by the iraf _ fxcor _ task ( between 0.5 and 3.0 km  s@xmath3 ) are smaller for the velocities obtained from comparison stars with temperatures close to that of the corresponding object .",
    "the average heliocentric radial velocities so obtained are @xmath51 km  s@xmath3 for gj 282a , @xmath52 km  s@xmath3 for gj 282b , and @xmath53 km  s@xmath3 for nltt 18149 , respectively .",
    "the standard deviation from the mean for the velocities derived from each template star is less than @xmath54 km  s@xmath3 for all three velocities , whereas their external error is estimated to be @xmath55 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "of course , the zero point of these measurements is linked to the coravel system . to our knowledge , of these three stars only gj 282a",
    "has previously published radial velocities , most recently by nordstroem et al .",
    "these authors find a value of @xmath56 km  s@xmath3 for the radial velocity of this star , as derived from 11 spectra obtained during 13 years , and assign a probability of @xmath57 for the observed velocity scatter to be due only to random observational errors . since this velocity was measured on the same radial velocity frame as those we obtained , the difference between their value and ours ( @xmath58 km  s@xmath3 ) is significant and could be due to a small systematic error in the wavelength calibration of our spectra . however , if real , such an error would be irrelevant for the purpose of this paper .    in order to improve our estimate of the precision of the velocities",
    "we cross - correlated the two spectral standards with no published coravel - based radial velocities , with the same five standards as above .",
    "the resulting velocities were @xmath59  km  s@xmath3 for gj 172 and @xmath60 km  s@xmath3 for gj 752a , which are , respectively , @xmath61 and @xmath62 km  s@xmath3 smaller than the velocities given by evans ( 1967 ) and listed in table 2 .",
    "hence , we estimate the precision of the radial velocities here obtained to be , at most , 2 km  s@xmath3 .    to directly measure the radial velocity differences between the three components of gj 282 , we additionally cross - correlated the spectra of a and c with that of component b ; we obtained @xmath63 and @xmath64 km  s@xmath3 , in excellent agreement with the differences obtained from the velocities measured through the template stars .",
    "we conclude that , when measured on the same reference system , the three objects have , within errors , the same heliocentric radial velocity .",

    "the four properties shared by the system gj 282 ab - nltt 18149 , to wit , common proper motions , common parallaxes , common radial velocities and common ages , constitute strong arguments in favor of a physical association of the three stars .",

    "there are several possible explanations for this difference .",
    "physically bound systems with large angular separations may have slightly different @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 simply due to projection effects .",
    "orbital motion of gj 282ab may also cause such differences .",
    "we examine each of these effects in turn . to assess the importance of projection effects we assume that the space motion of g112 - 29 is identical to that of gj282a . using the standard formulas ( e.g. smart 1962 ,",

    "these values are much smaller than the observed differences , and hence we conclude that the latter are not due solely to projection effects .    to estimate the importance of orbital motion of the pair gj 282ab we need the masses of both components .",
