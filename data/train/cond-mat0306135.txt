    "nonlinearity opens new perspectives for solving the problem of localization and storage of energy by biomolecules @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this problem is especially urgent within the context of enzymatic catalysis . how does an enzyme store and utilize the energy released at substrate binding ?",
    "the answer to this question is very poorly understood not only at quantitative but even at qualitative level . by now it is clear that dynamical contributions from linear modes into the mechanism of enzyme action are negligible because of high friction in such a condensed matter as protein interior leading to fast dissipation of energy @xcite .",
    "in contrast nonlinear systems provide us with examples of surprising behavior : the higher the friction is the slower the dissipation of energy proceeds @xcite ! though the generosity of this striking result is under question one can hope that since proteins are very rich structures for exhibiting nonlinear phenomena then some of them may play a functional role in enzymatic reactions . among nonlinear phenomena in biomolecules the so called discrete breather ( db ) or else intrinsic localized mode was put in the forefront during the last decade and even overshadowed such a fashionable concept as soliton .",
    "however most results on dbs were obtained within unrealistic models with toy potentials .",
    "that is why the progress in application of this new paradigm to proteins requires taking into account detailed information on protein dynamics if one wish to pass from toy models to realistic ones .",
    "last years are marked by noticeable progress in revealing subtleties of protein dynamics gained by infra - red ( ir ) spectroscopy @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , normal mode analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and molecular - dynamics simulations ( see the recent reviews @xcite , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "on the one hand time - resolved 2d measurements data suggest that in @xmath0-helicies there are distributions of the torsional ( dihedral ) angles ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) around their average values with a width of 20 degrees and that the conformation fluctuates on a time scale of picoseconds @xcite confirming previous molecular - dynamics studies . on the other hand the experiments of xie et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite demonstrate that very long - lived oscillations can exist in the @xmath0-helix proteins ( myoglobin , bacteriorhodopsin ) but not in the @xmath1-sheet one ( photoactive yellow protein ) when excited by a far ir laser pulse .",
    "the oscillations are observed in the amide - i band ( @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite and more vividly in the low - frequency band @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the absorption of radiation by proteins in the latter case is commonly attributed to the excitation of longitudinal and transverse modes of one - dimensional hydrogen bonded chains in @xmath0-helices @xcite .",
    "the normal mode analysis of myoglobin @xcite , @xcite , @xcite testifies that the anharmonic decay rate of higher frequency localized normal modes , calculated by perturbation theory , is typically nearly independent of temperature , consistent with results of pump - probe studies on myoglobin .",
    "in fact , the long - lived vibrations in the amide - i region of myoglobin @xcite are not all that long - lived , about 15 ps , so that this is really a predictable result .",
    "indeed , leitner @xcite and yu and leitner @xcite have presented calculations of anharmonic decay rates in the amide - i region of myoglobin , revealing that vibrational lifetimes of order 1 - 10 ps are quite likely and unsurprising . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of @xcite remain a puzzle . in this study ,",
    "long - lived excitations of over 500 ps are found near 115 @xmath3 .",
    "though there are no direct comparisons for bacteriorhodopsin , the anharmonic decay rates in myoglobin near 100 @xmath3 computed by yu and leitner are two orders of magnitude faster than this .    according to the conjecture of the authors of @xcite , @xcite their result suggests that a breather can be created in an @xmath0-helix .",
    "another interpretation of these experiment within the framework of davydov s soliton concept is also suggested @xcite .",
    "the latter utilizes the possibility of longitudinal mode excitation at the absorption of far ir radiation by proteins .",
    "however this interpretation encounters with difficulties at the point emphasized in @xcite that @xmath10-helices in myoglobin or bacteriorhodopsin are too short for such soliton could efficiently propagate in them . in this chapter",
    "the hypothesis is put forward that the long - lived oscillations in @xmath0-helicies are the fluctuations of the torsional angles of peptide groups around their equilibrium values .",
    "the aim of this chapter is to derive the possibility of the existence of a db in polypeptide chain from its microscopic model and to interpret the phenomena observed the papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our approach emphasizes another possibility as opposed to the paper @xcite : the excitation of transverse mode of one - dimensional hydrogen bonded chains in @xmath0-helices at the absorption of far ir radiation by proteins is actually that of oscillations of the peptide groups around their equilibrium positions in peptide chain ( the oxygen and nitrogen atoms oscillate transverse to the chain of peptide groups ) .",
    "this type of motion is shown to enable the existence of dbs in @xmath0-helices .",
    "thus the db in the peptide chain of @xmath0-helices can provide sustaining the long - lived oscillations excited by the absorption in the low - frequency band @xmath11 100 @xmath3 .",
    "dbs or else intrinsic localized modes ( time periodic spatially localized oscillations with significant amplitudes of several units in a chain of weakly coupled non - linear oscillators while others are at rest or oscillate with negligible amplitudes ) discovered by sievers and takeno in 1988 @xcite and proved by mackay and aubry @xcite to be structurally stable are well understood and commonly appreciated as generic phenomenon in nature at present ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the key ingredient for the existence of a db is the requirement of weak coupling interaction between adjacent nonlinear oscillators @xcite , @xcite .",
    "dbs have become a new and very fruitful paradigm in nonlinear physics .",
    "the concept of db has been applying to dna dynamics for a long time @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "its application to protein dynamics is damped by a point of view ( see e.g. @xcite ) that proteins are less capable than dna to exhibiting dbs because they are much less regular structures .",
    "however there are fragments of secondary structures in proteins that are highly regular . in @xcite a model for @xmath0-helix protein is considered that exhibits db existence in the chains of peptide groups connected by hydrogen bonds in the spirit of davydov s model for a soliton . in this chapter a model is constructed that pursues the same goal but for the peptide groups connected by c - c bonds in secondary structures of the backbone .",
    "another distinction from @xcite and from all other paper on dbs in biomolecules is that we deal with realistic effective on - site potentials and coupling interaction potentials rather than with model toy ones .",
    "these potentials are derived from a stringent microscopic model of the polypeptide chain and thus the present work seems to be a step to ab initio calculation of dbs in biomolecules .",
    "there are few analytical models treating non - linear mechanics of peptide chain backbone @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the reason for transparent lack of activity on analytical modeling of peptide chain backbone mechanics seems to stem from meager direct experimental evidence for nonlinear excitations in it .",
    "nevertheless the experiment @xcite can be considered as that and motivates the present attempt to construct a simple and tractable but at the same time microscopically stringent model of polypeptide backbone dynamics .",
    "a schematic picture of a polypeptide chain with all designations used further is presented in fig.1 .",
    "the mutual orientation of two adjacent peptide groups is characterized by the torsional ( dihedral ) angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the angle @xmath12 characterizes the rotation round the bond @xmath14 and that @xmath13 characterizes the rotation round the bond @xmath15 .",
    "further we consider the equilibrium dynamics in protein secondary structures in which the equilibrium values of the torsional angles are the same for all peptide groups ( they are listed at the end of the next sec . ) .",
    "we consider small deviations @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the torsional angles from their equilibrium values ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . at such amplitudes of the deviations",
    "the hydrogen bonds confining the peptide group in the secondary structure are not broken @xcite .",
    "finally we consider a peculiar type of motion @xmath22 .",
    "the latter means that the peptide group rotates as a whole respective some effective axis @xmath23 passing through the center of the c@xmath24n bond parallel to the bonds @xmath15 and @xmath25 that are assumed to be approximately parallel ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite ) .",
    "this type of motion is stipulated by the fact that the peptide group is a planar rigid structure @xcite , @xcite . for the sake of uniformity of designations",
    "we further denote @xmath28 ( see fig.2 ) and thus @xmath29 the moment of inertia of the peptide group relative to the axis @xmath23 can be easily calculated and is @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the polypeptide chain in our model with nearest neighbor interactions is @xmath31 here @xmath32 includes interactions defining the local potential of the peptide group ( namely hydrogen bonds , the so - called torsional potentials and the van der waals interaction of covalently non - bonded atoms of the peptide group with the atoms of adjacent side chains ) defining its separate motion while @xmath33 includes the coupling interactions ( namely the van der waals interaction of covalently non - bonded atoms of adjacent peptide groups i and i+1 and their electrostatic interaction ) intermixing the motions of these groups and leading to the rigidity of the peptide chain .",
    "it should be stressed that the latter potential also contributes into the separate motion of the peptide groups .",
    "we can define the effective on - site potential for such motion as @xmath34 and the coupling interaction potential as @xmath35 thus the equation of motion is @xmath36 in the following two sections we consider in details the functions @xmath37 and @xmath33 . at doing it we will freely pass back and forth between the variables according to the rule ( [ eq1 ] ) which can be rewritten as @xmath38",
    "both interactions in ( [ eq4 ] ) intermixing the motions of the adjacent peptide groups and contributing to the coupling interaction are described by the central potentials @xmath39 and @xmath40 between the atom @xmath41 of the i - th peptide group and the atom @xmath42 of the i+1-th one with @xmath43 being the distance between the atoms @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the electrostatic potential is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are partial charges on the atoms @xmath42 and @xmath41 respectively ( @xmath47 where @xmath48 cgs @xcite ) and @xmath49 is the dielectric constant which for protein interior should be better conceived as some adjustable parameter ( @xmath50 with 3.5 being commonly accepted value close to high frequency permeability of peptides ) @xcite , @xcite . in some studies @xmath49",

    "described above . however for making use of suggestive analogies with the known literature results obtained on toy models we calculate the so called coupling constant which is a key characteristic of the truncated coupling interaction potential . expanding the potential",

    "we assume the partners to have fixed positions .",
    "since in the @xmath0-helix the partners come from third peptide groups along the chain from a given one this assumption imposes a restriction on the size of a db which can be considered , namely the assumption can be justified for dbs comprising no more than 5 sites ( peptide groups ) .",
    "the elimination of the restriction for the @xmath0-helix would actually mean taking into account the long range interaction @xmath110 along the peptide chain .",

    "the adjustable parameters are chosen to satisfy the following set of requirements : 1 .",

    "for all three structures the coupling interaction is surprisingly weak providing good conditions for the existence of a db .",
    "for the @xmath0-helix and the anti - parallel @xmath1-sheet the effective on - site potential is hard ( goes more steep than a harmonic one ) and the coupling interaction is repulsive ( a non - zero value of a peptide group displacement tends to increase the values of the neighboring peptide groups displacements with the opposite sign ) . in accordance with the theorems of the paper",
    "@xcite a stable db must be of zig - zag shape ( peptide groups undergo out of phase oscillations ) .",
    "for the parallel @xmath1-sheet the effective on - site potential is soft ( goes less steep than a harmonic one ) and the coupling interaction is attractive ( a non - zero value of a peptide group displacement tends to increase the values of the neighboring peptide groups displacements with the same sign ) .",
    "in accordance with the theorems of the paper @xcite a stable db must also be of zig - zag shape .",
    "thus for no type of protein secondary structure a bell shape db ( peptide groups undergo in phase oscillations ) can be stable .    in what follows we restrict ourselves by considering the case of a db in the @xmath0-helix because only for it the experimental data suggest such a phenomenon @xcite ( see the beginning of the discussion ) .",
    "the set of difference equations ( [ eq5 ] ) can not be solved analytically and is analyzed by direct numerical integration for 25 coupled equations ( motivated by the fact that 25 is the average number of peptide groups in @xmath0-helicies of bacteriorhodopsin used in the experiment @xcite ) .",
    "we use fixed - end boundary conditions @xmath137 that seem to be more appropriate for the situation in proteins than commonly used periodic ones .",
    "we find as an example a 3-site db . to prove that a localized and stable object can be obtained in the @xmath10-helix we resort to the usual procedure @xcite .",
    "we define the discrete per site energy in 3 lattice sites around the 13-th central one @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the individual symmetrized local site energy density @xmath140 the existence of a localized and stable zig - zag shape db is exemplified in fig.4 by the fact that the energy e(3 ) remains essentially constant with time and in fig.5 by an explicit picture .",
    "it should be stressed that for our realistic potentials it is rather difficult to switch out the coupling interaction without modifying the effective on - site potential .",
    "thus the commonly accepted way to construct a db starting from an uncoupled ( or else anticontinuous ) limit is inapplicable in our case .",
    "that is why , instead , we find the initial configuration to fall into a db from the very beginning at a given coupling interaction for the @xmath0-helix calculated in sec.3 . in fig.4 and",
    "fig.5 this configuration is chosen to be @xmath141 ; @xmath142 while @xmath143 for all other i and zero velocity at each site .",
    "the chosen amplitude @xmath144 corresponds to the deviations of the torsional angles @xmath145 from their equilibrium values .",
    "the results obtained testify that a localized and stable zig - zag shape db can exist in all three types of protein secondary structure",
    ". however experimental data which can be interpreted with the help of the db concept are available only for @xmath10-helix proteins but not @xmath1-sheet ones @xcite , @xcite . in our opinion",
    "the reason for this is in the way of excitation of long - lived oscillations in this experiments rather than in the propensities of different types of protein secondary structure to sustaining dbs .",
    "the absorption of far ir laser pulse used in @xcite by proteins requires long one - dimensional hydrogen bonded chains @xcite that take place in @xmath10-helicies but are absent in @xmath1-sheets .    the revealed hardness of the effective on - site potential for the @xmath0-helix and the anti - parallel @xmath1-sheet is in contrast with a widely spread point of view that such potential in biomolecules is mainly determined by hydrogen bonds and that is why should be a soft - type one @xcite , @xcite . in our case",
    "detailed account of all interactions leads to a contrary result .",
    "the energy of the 3-site db obtained for the @xmath0-helix is @xmath146 at t=300 @xmath147 .",
    "this value means that at room temperatures large amplitude dbs ( @xmath148 ) can hardly be spontaneously excited by thermal fluctuations .",
    "however the latter may not be true for dbs with smaller amplitudes and here it seems timely to touch upon the question of influence of temperature on the existence of dbs in protein secondary structures .",
    "dbs are known to remain essentially stationary and localized and to be very long - lived at zero temperature . at non - zero temperatures",
    "thermal fluctuations tend to lead to db motion and more rapid decay @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . within the framework of our interpretation of the the experiment of @xcite with the help of a db concept",
    "it should be recalled that the observed there long - lived oscillations in @xmath0-helicies of bacteriorhodopsin excited by far ir laser pulse have a life - time of order of 500 ps accommodating approximately 1500 vibrations .",
    "the decay of a db can be formally modeled by introducing a dissipative term @xmath149 in the left hand side of the equation of motion ( [ eq5 ] ) and corresponding white noise @xmath150 in the right hand one . here",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath151 must be related with the white noise correlation function via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the boltzman constant , t is the temperature , @xmath154 is dirac @xmath155-function and @xmath156 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "however such formal way of introducing dissipation does not reveal the microscopic origin of the friction coefficient @xmath151 . to do it for the case of peptide chain dynamics",
    "is a difficult task which is out of the scope of this chapter .",
    "here we can afford ourselves only some preliminary speculations on this subject .",
    "there are different contributions into the mechanism of friction that can be conceivable for the peptide chain rotational dynamics in protein interior .",
    "the most obvious hydrodynamic damping by interaction with solvent seems to be of minor importance because at considered deviations of the torsional angles @xmath157 the linear displacements are much less than the diameter of a water molecule ( see also @xcite and refs . therein ) . in our opinion",
    "the dominant contribution into dissipation originates from the fact that the rotation of the peptide group at angle x round the axis @xmath23 requires some translational displacement of axis points where the atoms @xmath158 and @xmath159 are initially situated ( see fig.2 ) that leads to transvers distortions of the backbone ( actually this is the excitation of transvers linear phonon modes ) .",
    "such process consumes energy leading to an acoustic damping mechanism . at a macroscopic level",
    "this dissipation mechanism can be described by the so called `` landau damping '' @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "however such phenomenological description requires support from microscopic consideration that is beyond our knowledge at present .",
    "moreover the situation with dissipation is not so unambiguous as one can conceive from above .",
    "there are testimonies that in some cases of nonlinear lattices the energy relaxation from a db first accelerates with the increase of the friction coefficient from zero value but then becomes slower and slower @xcite !",
    "it is not clear at present whether this surprising result is generic or it is model dependent ( e.g. , dependent on the type of the thermostat used ) . in any case",
    "it opens interesting perspectives for application of the db concept to the problem of localized vibrational energy storage in enzymes . in this connection",
    "the coincidence of the obtained value for the db energy ( @xmath161 at room temperature ) with usual activation energies of enzymatic reactions is rather intriguing .",
    "one can imagine oneself that in secondary structures of enzymes there dbs can be excited at substrate binding and be long - lived enough to play some functional role as the sources of energy localization and storage utilizing in such a way the binding energy .",
    "for instance a db may serve as the so called `` rate promoting vibration '' ( rpv ) for enzymatic reactions involving enviromentally assisted hydrogen tunneling .",
    "the rpv acquires more and more experimental testimonies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite but its physical origin still remains mysterious .",
    "however the estimated dominant peaks in the spectral densities of the rpv indicate motions on the 150 @xmath3 frequency scale @xcite that is rather close to the obtained frequency 115 @xmath3 of the db in the @xmath162-helix .",
    "here we refrain from further discussing this speculation .",
    "the conclusions of this chapter are summarized as follows .",
    "the dynamics of a peptide chain is considered within a realistic model with stringent microscopically derived coupling interaction potential and effective on - site potential .",
    "the coupling interaction is found to be surprisingly weak for all three main types of protein secondary structure but different in character : repulsive for @xmath0-helix and anti - parallel @xmath1-sheet structures and attractive for parallel @xmath1-sheet structure .",
    "the effective on - site potential is found to be a hard one for @xmath0-helix and anti - parallel @xmath1-sheet and a soft one for parallel @xmath1-sheet . in all three types of protein secondary structure a stable zig - zag shape discrete breather associated with the oscillations of torsional ( dihedral ) angles can exist due to the weakness of the coupling interaction .",

    "<S> the role of the rigidity of a peptide chain in its equilibrium dynamics is investigated within a realistic model with stringent microscopically derived coupling interaction potential and effective on - site potential . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling interaction characterizing the chain rigidity and the effective on - site potentials are calculated for three main types of protein secondary structure . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling interaction is found to be surprisingly weak for all of them but different in character : repulsive for @xmath0-helix and anti - parallel @xmath1-sheet structures and attractive for parallel @xmath1-sheet structure . </S>",
    "<S> the effective on - site potential is found to be a hard one for @xmath0-helix and anti - parallel @xmath1-sheet and a soft one for parallel @xmath1-sheet . in all three types of protein secondary structures a stable zig - zag shape discrete breather ( db ) associated with the oscillations of torsional ( dihedral ) angles can exist due to weakness of the coupling interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the absorption of far infrared radiation ( ir ) by proteins is known to require the existence of rather long chains of hydrogen bonds that takes place only in @xmath0-helicies , then one can conclude that the excitation of a db in such a way is possible in @xmath0-helix and seems to be hardly possible in @xmath2-sheet structures . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of the recent experiments of xie et al . on far ir laser pulse spectroscopy of proteins is suggested . </S>",
