    "<S> this behavior or the equivalent statement that the ratio of pauli to dirac form factors , @xmath4 is a approximately constant , indicates that quarks in the proton carry non - zero orbital angular momentum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this note is concerned with the shape of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> several subtleties and difficulties enter in determining the shape . as a particle of spin 1/2 </S>",
    "<S> , the proton can have no quadrupole moment , according to the wigner - eckhart theorem . </S>",
    "<S> thus any non - spherical manifestation must reside in fluctuating components of the quantum wave function . </S>",
    "<S> another difficulty occurs in using experiments in which momentum is transferred to the proton . </S>",
    "<S> the proton s final state carries different total momentum than that of the initial state , and the effects of boosts cause the initial and final state wave functions to differ . for example , one often thinks of a particle in relativistic motion having a pancake shape because of the effects of lorentz contraction . </S>",
    "<S> such an effect is caused by external influence and is therefore not a manifestation of the intrinsic shape of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> another possible problem occurs through the use of light cone coordinates , which involves a separation of coordinates into longitudinal and transverse that complicates a simple interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> our technique is to use a model of the proton wave function@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , constructed with invariance and parameters constrained by data , to compute specific matrix elements using only the proton s rest frame wave function and ordinary coordinates .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic experimental observables concerning us are the form factors : @xmath5 with @xmath6 obtained from a non - spin flip matrix element , and @xmath7 from a spin - flip term . in evaluating the right - hand - side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defs ] ) we take @xmath8 to be that of free quarks@xcite , @xmath9 times the quark charge . </S>",
    "<S> we use a frame in which @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> our three - quark wave function is constructed using symmetries@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is antisymmetric , expressed in terms of relative momentum variables , an eigenstate of the spin - operator defined by the pauli - lubanski vector , is rotationally invariant and reduces to non - relativistic su(6 ) wave function in the limit that the quark mass goes to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function is given by _ </S>",
    "<S> s(p_i)=(m_0 ^ 2 ) u(p_1 ) u(p_2 ) u(p_3)_s(p_1,p_2,p_3),p_i=_i s_i,_i [ wave]where @xmath11 is a spin - isospin color amplitude factor@xcite , the @xmath12 are expressed in terms of relative coordinates ( with @xmath13 ) , the @xmath14 are dirac spinors and @xmath15 is a spatial wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments of the spatial wave function are taken as the mass - squared operator for a non - interacting system@xcite : m_32(^2+m^2)^1/2 , m_0=(^2+m_3 ^ 2)^1/2 + ( ^2+m^2)^1/2 , where @xmath16 is the relative momentum between quarks labeled 1 and 2 and @xmath17 is the momentum of the third quark@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial wave function is of the schlumpf@xcite form : ( m_0)=n(m^2_0+^2)^ , = 0.607 , = 3.5 , m = 0.267 . </S>",
    "<S> [ params ] the value of @xmath18 is chosen that @xmath19 is approximately constant for @xmath20the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are determined by the charge radius and magnetic moment of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> slightly different values of @xmath23 and @xmath22 are used when the effects of the pion cloud are incorporated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using these newer values would cause very small differences here .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of electromagnetic form factor is completely defined once this wave function and operator @xmath8 are specified . </S>",
    "<S> although the evaluation was presented long ago@xcite and explained recently@xcite , it is worthwhile to briefly explain how the constant nature of the ratio @xmath24 emerges from the relativistic nature of the calculation . the wave function eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wave ] ) is completely anti - symmetric , so we may take @xmath8 to act only on the third quark which absorbs the momentum of the virtual photon . </S>",
    "<S> the average charge of the third quark in the mixed - symmetric component of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wave ] ) vanishes , so the only component of the wave function that enters in the calculation of electromagnetic form factors is the mixed anti - symmetric component in which the first two quarks have a vanishing total angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> then the spin of the proton @xmath25 is governed by the third quark . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant dirac spinor is : u(p_3=,s)=1 (    c ( e(k)+m)s + s    ) , [ spinor]with @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the total angular momentum of the proton is denoted by @xmath25 and the lower component contains a term @xmath27 that allows the quark to have a spin opposite to that of the proton s total angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath28 reveals the presence of the quark orbital angular momentum : the struck quark may carry a spin that is opposite to that of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> consequently helicity is not conserved@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath29 is very large compared to @xmath21 and the third quark changes its momentum from @xmath28 to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> then the form factor depends on the matrix element of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> if we keep only the largest terms , those proportional to @xmath29 , we find |u(k,s ) ^+u(k , s)~sq + k^+m_0qi_y s.[big]the spin - flip term proportional to @xmath32 arises from the lower component of the spinor of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spinor ] ) , and this term has the same large factor @xmath29 as the non - spin - flip term . thus eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defs ] ) tells us that @xmath33 and @xmath6 have the same dependence on @xmath29 , so their ratio is constant . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of an eigenstate of spin , mandates the use of dirac spinors . </S>",
    "<S> the lower components of these spinors carry the quark orbital angular momentum responsible for the constant nature of @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to interpret these features of the wave function in terms of the shapes of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> the technique of defining spin - dependent density operators is introduced by presenting two simple examples . </S>",
    "<S> consider a non - relativistic nuclear wave function consisting of a proton outside a @xmath35 inert core . </S>",
    "<S> the proton is bound by a combination of a central and spin - orbit potential , and the single particle wave function is an eigenfunction of total angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> consider the case @xmath36 , with one unit of orbital angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> then the proton wave function is a two - component pauli spinor : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proton s position , and @xmath39 is a pauli spinor . </S>",
    "<S> the charge density of this system is the expectation value of the density operator @xmath40 : with @xmath41 and is spherically symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> however , consider instead the case that we require the proton at a position @xmath42 to have a spin in a direction defined by a unit vector @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> then we define a spin - dependent density : ( , ) = & & _ </S>",
    "<S> 1,1/2s(-_p)(1+)2_1,1/2s + & & = r^2(r)2s1 + 2 -s.an </S>",
    "<S> interesting special case is to take @xmath44 parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of the proton angular momentum @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of this vector defines an axis ( the `` z - axis '' ) , and the direction of vectors can be represented in terms of this axis : @xmath46 . with this notation @xmath47 and the non - spherical shape </S>",
    "<S> is exhibited clearly . </S>",
    "<S> note that the average of these two cases would give a spherical shape ( as would an average over the direction of the total angular momentum ) , but the ability to define a spin - dependent density allows the presence of the orbital angular momentum to be revealed in the shape of the computed density .    </S>",
    "<S> another useful example is that of the dirac electron wave function of the hydrogen atom . </S>",
    "<S> this wave function is a four - component spinor given by @xmath48 with _ </S>",
    "<S> e_e = nr_e^(-m_er_e ) (    c 1s + i/2_es    ) , where @xmath49 is the fine structure constant and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the expectation value of the spin - dependent density operator , in terms of dirac matrices : @xmath51 , so that with @xmath52.$ ] we see that the hydrogen atom is deformed ! </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence is @xmath53 so that the shape is almost spherical . but </S>",
    "<S> the principle is clear : relativity as manifest by lower components of a dirac wave function implies a deformed shape , if the matrix element is computed in a state of fixed total angular momentum . for @xmath54/4 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 10,8)(0,-9 )    [ fig:1 ]    with these examples in hand we turn to the proton . </S>",
    "<S> its wave function is specified in momentum space , so we define a momentum - space , spin - dependent , charge - density operator : ( , ) = e^i|()e ( ^0+_5)(*0 * ) , [ qft ] where @xmath55 is the quark charge operator in units of the proton charge . </S>",
    "<S> the quark field operators are evaluated at equal time . in qcd , one would need to add a factor between the field operators to ensure gauge invariance . with the present model , any gluons </S>",
    "<S> are contained within constituent quarks , so the factor becomes unity . </S>",
    "<S> for our model , it is convenient to use first - quantized notation so that : ( , ) _ </S>",

    "<S> we find ( , ) = _ s(,)_s=(k)12(1++(k ) ( 1-+2 ) ) [ shapek ] with ( k)d^3k ^2(k , k)(e(k)+m),(k).[rhodef]some special cases of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ shapek ] ) are interesting . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the quark spin is parallel to the proton spin , @xmath59 , then @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> for small @xmath61 the shape is nearly spherical , but for large @xmath61 the @xmath62 term becomes prominent . on the other hand , the quark spin could be anti - parallel to the proton spin , @xmath63 . </S>",
