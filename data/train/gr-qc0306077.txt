    "although electro - optic amplitude modulators and phase modulators are commonplace in modern optics laboratories , there is no single , commercially available device that produces controllable amplitude and phase modulations with complete variability . when required ,",
    "various optical configurations have been assembled , such as phase and amplitude modulators in series @xcite , and two phase modulators used in a mach - zehnder interferometric setup ( the mach - zehnder modulator ) @xcite , which are both capable of amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "the device discussed in this paper , called a _ universally tunable modulator _ ( utm ) , is a modification of a commercial electro - optic amplitude modulator .",
    "an amplitude modulator consists of two phase - modulation crystals aligned at right angles , and connected with opposite polarities to a single electrical input .",
    "a utm ( see fig .",
    "[ figsmvectors](a ) ) is identical , but with two separate inputs , one connected to each crystal .",
    "a prototype was constructed from a new focus broadband amplitude modulator ( model @xmath0 ) in this way .",
    "we demonstrate here that this extra degree of freedom enables the production of phase as well as amplitude modulation .",
    "we use the term `` universally tunable '' to highlight the fact that the device is capable of both amplitude modulation ( am ) and phase modulation ( pm ) , with full selectability of the amplitude of each and of the relative phase between the two . choosing a figure of merit with which to assess",
    "the device is difficult in general , and depends on the modulation requirements of the application in question .",
    "we address this issue here by identifying two characteristics that might be expected of the modulations states produced by the device : _ variability _ and _ purity_. the variable nature of the device is brought out by experiments which require real - time tuning of the modulator across its parameter space .",
    "other experiments rely on precise selection of a small number of operating points , where the purity of the modulations produced has a direct influence on the success of the experiment .",
    "one anticipated use for the utm device is in optical feedback control of the resonance condition of a fabry - perot cavity , or the fringe condition of a michelson interferometer .",
    "the rf modulation techniques used to lock these devices are pound - drever - hall locking @xcite and schnupp modulation locking @xcite , respectively , and are both based on properties of the devices that convert ( injected ) pm to am , which is then demodulated to give an error signal readout . in both cases ,",
    "the default locking point is at a turning point in the transmitted ( or reflected ) optical field intensity ; injection into the device of additional am ( along with the default pm ) causes the device to lock with an offset relative to the turning point .",
    "moreover , the quadrature of am required for pound - drever - hall locking is orthogonal to that required for schnupp modulation locking , introducing the possibility of independently tuning two lock points at once in a coupled system . this _",
    "rf offset locking _ application is our case study example to demonstrate the variability property of a prototype utm ; the technique may be useful for future large - scale gravitational wave detector configurations @xcite , with the feature of facilitating real - time tuning of detector frequency responses @xcite .",
    "the utm device is capable of several `` pure '' states , which have various applications as well as providing a natural way to test the purity property of the prototype .",
    "single - sideband modulation , for example , requires an equal combination of am and pm , in quadrature .",
    "the subject has arisen a number of times with optic fibre technology where , for example , a single - sideband - modulated signal is immune to fibre dispersion penalties @xcite , and the technique has also been suggested for subcarrier - multiplexing systems @xcite .",
    "single - sideband modulation has been achieved by other means : optically filtering out one sideband @xcite ; cascaded amplitude and phase modulators @xcite ; mach - zehnder modulators @xcite ; and more complex arrangements @xcite .",
    "while these methods have merit , we submit that the utm is far simpler in design , with fewer degrees of freedom available to drift , and is at least comparable regarding suppression capabilities .",
    "the utm can produce pm or am states , with purity limited by the accuracy of polarisation optics ( including the birefringent effects of the device itself ) .",
    "while these states are obtainable using off - the - shelf amplitude or phase modulators , applications in coherent state quantum cryptography require fast - switching between am and pm @xcite , for which the utm is ideal .",
    "other applications , including some quantum communication protocols @xcite , would also benefit from having easy access to a tuned , stationary combination of am and pm .",
    "in addition , we show that the utm ( or indeed an amplitude modulator ) can produce a _ carrier suppression _ state , where the output consists only of two modulation sidebands .    we have developed a geometric phase sphere description of modulation states , the _ modulation sphere _ formulation , in analogy with the poincar sphere description for polarisation states @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the use of this formalism by calculating the transfer function ( electrical to optical ) of the utm device , both using optical - field - phasors and using modulation sphere parameters , and discuss the pros and cons of the two mathematical descriptions .",
    "we have found that the modulation sphere representation is particularly useful for gaining a visual insight into the dynamics of the utm .",
    "section [ 2model ] gives the mathematical description of the utm , in terms of optical - field - phasors ( section [ 2phasor2 ] ) , and the modulation sphere formulation ( section [ 2modsphere3 ] ) .",
    "the transfer functions from these two subsections are derived in appendices [ secapp1 ] and [ secapp2 ] respectively .",
    "section [ 3expt ] describes a characterisation experiment conducted on a prototype utm , with the experimental layout described in section [ 3expt2 ] , and the results presented in section [ 3results3 ] .",
    "the main results of the study are summarised in section [ 4conc ] .",
    "before we proceed , a simple analogy may help to clarify the inner workings of a utm device , and lend physical insight .",
    "a mach - zehnder modulator involves splitting a beam into two parts , separately phase - modulating each part , then recombining the two parts on a beamsplitter .",
    "the utm is physically equivalent to this , where the two interferometer paths are collinear but different in polarisation .",
    "each utm crystal modulates one and only one polarisation component .",
    "the phase between the electric fields in the two polarisation states we identify as the interferometric recombination phase .",
    "the birefringent waveplates used to create the initial polarisation take the place of the input beamsplitter , and a polarising beamsplitter facilitates the output recombination .",
    "the recombination phase is adjustable ( by modifying the polarisation state ) , and one can control the amplitudes and phases of the single - beam phase - modulations generated by each of the two crystals . through manipulation of these input parameters ,",
    "the user has complete control over the interference condition of the two carrier beams , and separately over the interference of the lower and upper sidebands generated by the modulating crystals .",
    "this amounts to having complete freedom to choose any modulation state by appropriate choice of the input parameters .    as an example , consider two identically phase - modulated beams , where the optical phase of one beam is advanced by @xmath1 , and the modulation phase of the other beam is advanced by @xmath1 .",
    "the result , upon interfering the two beams , is that one resultant sideband is exactly cancelled out and the other is additively reinforced , producing a single sideband state .",
    "one can intuitively arrive at all of the modulation states discussed in this paper by reasoning along these lines . in the next section ,",
    "we quantify such reasoning into a mathematical theory of the utm .      as stated earlier , a utm ( see fig .  [ figsmvectors](a ) )",
    "consists of two modulating crystals in series , with separate voltage sources , and with modulating axes at right angles to each other .",
    "the utm is used by sending a laser beam of elliptical polarisation through the system , and then through a linearly polarising filter angled at @xmath2 to the crystals modulating axes .",
    "the choice of polarisation state of the incident beam has a crucial effect on the transfer characteristics of the system .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a subset of polarisation states : those where there is equal power in the polarisation components aligned with each modulating crystal axis .",
    "equivalently , we require that the polarisation is elliptical with major and minor axes aligned at @xmath2 to both crystal axes .",
    "for concreteness we will choose the ellipse axes to be horizontal and vertical , and the crystal axes to be left and right diagonal ( as in fig .",
    "[ figsmvectors](a ) ) .",
    "we define the angle @xmath3 as being the phase difference between left - diagonal and right - diagonal electric field components of the light exiting the crystals ( see fig .  [ figsmvectors](b ) ) .",
    "the identity @xmath4 follows , where @xmath5 are the powers in the horizontal and vertical polarisation components of the input laser beam .",
    "we introduce this degree of freedom with the application of gravitational wave detector locking schemes in mind , where laser power is at a premium : choosing @xmath3 such that the beam is almost vertically polarised allows us to retain the majority of the input carrier power , while retaining full access to all modulation states , albeit with reduced amplitude .",
    "note that , in the ideal situation where both crystals have identical refractive indices and lengths , the phase angle @xmath3 ( and hence the polarisation state ) is the same before and after the modulator .",
    "however , a real device almost certainly does not have identical crystals so that the relative phase between left- and right - diagonal components may well be changed by the crystals , in which case @xmath3 should describe the polarisation state of the light _ exiting _ the modulator , just before it reaches the linearly polarising filter .",
    "the inputs to the two crystal electrodes are sinusoidal voltages of frequency @xmath6 ; we describe these as complex phasors @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) so that the single - crystal phase modulations are given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively return the real and imaginary components of a complex variable .    we can similarly write the output phase and amplitude modulations as complex phasors @xmath13 and @xmath14 where the optical field amplitude exiting the utm can be shown to be : @xmath15   \\nonumber \\\\    = e_{\\mathrm{in } } \\ , \\left [ \\ , \\mathrm{cos}(\\sigma/2 )      + i p \\mathrm{cos}(\\omega_m",
    "t + \\phi_p ) + a \\mathrm{cos}(\\omega_m t + \\phi_a ) \\ , \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the input optical field amplitude . in eq .",
    "[ eqnelecfield ] , we have assumed small single - crystal modulation depths ( @xmath17 ) , and we have factored away the net optical phase dependence .    the relationship between input and output parameters for the utm device can be shown to be : @xmath18 ( a proof of this transfer function is outlined in appendix [ secapp1 ] . )    an important observation from eq .",
    "[ eqntf ] is that the phases of the am and pm track the phases of the sum and difference of the electrical signals , respectively .",
    "thus , an electronic oscillator for use in demodulation schemes is readily available , and can be calibrated once for all operating points .",
    "this phase - tracking property holds for any choice of @xmath3 ; the effect of a change of polarisation ellipticity is to change the overall quantity of pm or am available ( as well as changing the overall beam power in eq .",
    "[ eqnelecfield ] ) .",
    "returning briefly to the topic of conserving as much carrier power as possible for gravitational wave detector applications , we derive a useful rule - of - thumb for selecting an appropriate amount of power to tap off .",
    "consider eq .",
    "[ eqntf ] when we set @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 have the same magnitude ( we do this in order to focus on the _ coefficients _ of the complex @xmath22 phasors ) .",
    "the ratio of modulation power between the am and pm components is @xmath23 and , comparing this with eq .",
    "[ eqnident ] , we have : @xmath24",
    "so , the fraction of power tapped off is directly proportional to the fraction of modulation power available to be expressed as am ( rather than pm ) . typically then",
    ", if @xmath25 of the output power is tapped off , and the user wishes to alternately produce a pure pm state and then a pure am state ( each of the same modulation power ) , then the am state will require 9 times the input electrical power in compensation , compared to the pm state .",
    "it is apparent from eqs .",
    "[ eqnelecfield ] and [ eqntf ] that for @xmath26 the carrier and the pm contribution vanish , leaving only the am component .",
    "this is the _ carrier suppression _ operating point , where only two sidebands remain .",
    "the modulation ceases to be of the phase or amplitude type due to the absence of a carrier as a phase reference , though the modulation retains its beat phase through the second harmonic in optical power .",
    "a rearrangement of eq .",
    "[ eqnelecfield ] serves to clarify the nature of single sideband modulation : @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath28 terms represent optical sidebands at @xmath29 relative to the optical carrier frequency , and an asterisk denotes a complex conjugate .",
    "it is clear then that choosing @xmath30 eliminates one or other of the sidebands .",
    "in other words , a single sideband state corresponds to having equal amounts of pm and am where the two modulations are in quadrature .",
    "we now define a geometric phase representation of the modulation parameters of the system to further clarify the transfer characteristics of the utm device .",
    "this is analogous to using stokes parameters and the poincar sphere representation for optical polarisation states @xcite . in this case , we transform from the complex quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 to a set of ( real ) coordinates @xmath33 in _",
    "m - space _ via the transformation : @xmath34 a single point in m - space represents a distinct modulation state . in particular",
    ", the m - space representation suppresses the common ( beat ) phase of the modulation state ; the equations are defined in terms of the relative phase difference between am and pm contributions .",
    "this is a useful simplification in that now every physically distinct modulation corresponds to one point and one only . on the other hand",
    ", one can not use the representation for demodulation - phase - tracking calculations , when the physical significance of the modulation s overall phase is renewed by the presence of an external ( electrical ) phase reference .",
    "[ taboppoints ]    the three m - space parameters can be interpreted as follows : @xmath35 measures the extent to which one kind of modulation ( am or pm ) dominates over the other ; @xmath36 measures the degree to which the present pm and am components are correlated or anti - correlated in phase ; and @xmath37 measures the degree to which the present pm and am components are in quadrature phase to each other , and thus also measures the extent to which one frequency sideband has more power than the other .",
    "we also define the _ modulation power _ by @xmath38 , from whence @xmath39 follows .",
    "therefore , a surface of constant @xmath40 is a sphere in m - space ( see fig .",
    "[ figspheres](b ) ) .",
    "we attach particular significance to modulation states whose m - space coordinates lie on one cardinal axis .",
    "the point @xmath41 represents pure pm , and the point @xmath42 represents pure am .",
    "the points @xmath43 represent correlated and anti - correlated pm and am , and @xmath44 represent upper and lower single sideband states .",
    "details of these states are summarised in table i. these states , particularly those on the @xmath35 and @xmath37 axes , involve the suppression of a particular signal , and so provide a natural way to test the precision of a real device .",
    "before we proceed , it is convenient to define an analogous _ q - space _ representation , @xmath45 , for the electrical input parameters , via : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the sum input electrical power .",
    "physical interpretations for these parameters correspond with the m - space equivalents ( see fig .",
    "[ figspheres](a ) for a diagrammatic description ) .",
    "now , we can rewrite the utm transfer function , eq .",
    "[ eqntf ] , in terms of the m - space and q - space parameters : @xmath48 ( a proof of this transfer function is outlined in appendix [ secapp2 ] . )    since the modulation power @xmath40 depends partly on @xmath49 ( and hence depends on the _ detail _ of the input signals , not just the overall input power @xmath50 ) , a sphere of constant electrical input power in q - space does _ not _ , in general , map to a sphere of constant modulation power in m - space .",
    "in fact , eq .  [ eqntfellipse ] describes a transfer function from a sphere in q - space to an _ ellipsoid _ in m - space .",
    "it can be shown that the ellipsoid is centered at @xmath51 , has radii @xmath52 $ ] , and has an eccentricity of @xmath53 .",
    "the ellipse is always prolate with long axis aligned with the @xmath35-axis , and always has one focus at the m - space origin .",
    "the orthogonality of axes is preserved in the transformation , which consists only of a translation ( the ellipsoid is not origin - centered ) and a dilation ( the ellipsoid is squashed in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions ) .",
    "the centrepoint and proportions of the ellipsoid are parametrised by the input light s polarisation parameter , @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ figspheres](c ) ) .",
    "a special case occurs for @xmath54 ( circular input polarisation ) , when eq .",
    "[ eqntfellipse ] reduces to : @xmath55 here , a sphere in q - space maps to a sphere in m - space .",
    "this case is particularly instructive as figs . [",
    "figspheres](a ) and [ figspheres](b ) take on a new significance : there is now a direct graphical correspondence between the two spheres , in accordance with eq .",
    "[ eqntfsphere ] .",
    "so , as an example of using these spheres as a visual tool , we can see `` at a glance '' that the pm operating point is obtained by running both crystals with equal in - phase electrical inputs , or that a single sideband is obtained by running both crystals with equal inputs in quadrature .",
    "the following characterisation experiment was designed to measure the amplitude and phase response of a prototype utm device with respect to both the am and pm output states . in particular , we focus here on two kinds of measurement : those that measure the _ variability _ of the utm device , and those that measure the _ purity _ of the modulations that the utm device can produce . by variability , we refer to the capability of the utm prototype to tune around the parameter space of modulations , or `` dial up '' a particular modulation , in a predictable , theory - matching fashion and with a reasonable level of precision . by purity",
    ", we speak of the utm prototype s ability to accurately attain a particular modulation ( especially those that involve suppression of a frequency line ) and to hold that modulation indefinitely without drifting .",
    "the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ figexpt ] .",
    "the polarisation of a laser source was prepared with a half- and quarter - wave plate in series , and the laser source was passed through the utm , which we operated at @xmath56  mhz .",
    "a polarising beam splitter completed the process ; the vertically polarized output carried the modulation described in the theory above .",
    "the horizontally polarised output was used to keep track of the polarisation state , and hence to measure the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the polarisation state used corresponded to @xmath57 ( near - circular polarisation with the vertical component stronger ) , for experimental convenience .",
    "regarding the modulator itself , the original new focus amplitude modulator ( model 4104 ) carried the specification : max @xmath58  v @ @xmath59 . while we did not explicitly measure @xmath60 for the prototype utm ( after the modification from the original am device ) , we point out that it should still be of the same order of magnitude . therefore , since the input voltages used did not exceed 10  v , the following results are in the small modulation depth limit as described in section [ 2model][2phasor2 ] .",
    "a heterodyne detection scheme formed part of the measurement apparatus , where a shunted beam was frequency - shifted by @xmath61  mhz with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) . if this heterodyne oscillator beam is represented by @xmath62 with @xmath63 and is interfered with the modulated beam from eq .",
    "[ eqnelecfield ] , then the detected power is given by : @xmath64 ; \\nonumber \\\\    p_{\\mathrm{dc } } & = & \\mathrm{cos}^2(\\frac{\\sigma}{2 } ) ; \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath65 represents the measurable beat due to the presence of am , @xmath66 is the beat between the carrier and the heterodyne oscillator , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent heterodyned copies of the two modulation sidebands .",
    "a spectrum analyser was used to monitor the strength of these frequency lines .",
    "the use of the spectrum analyser facilitated the assessment of the _ purity _ of states produced by the utm prototype , by observing operating points that involved suppression of one of these frequency lines .",
    "an alternative set of measurables was obtained by electronically mixing the heterodyne frequencies down to baseband via a _",
    "double - demodulation _ scheme .",
    "this gave a dc readout of the pm and am amplitudes at a selected beat phase .",
    "a complete description of the modulation strengths and quadratures was obtained in this way , and was hence useful to characterise the _ variability _ of the utm prototype .",
    "the method of signal extraction via double demodulation is best understood by reworking the last two components of eq .",
    "[ eqndetpower ] to : @xmath69\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this signal is mixed down to base band by demodulating at @xmath61  mhz and then @xmath56  mhz in series .",
    "the output of a demodulation is sensitive to the relative phases of the signals being mixed : if they are exactly in - phase or out - of - phase , the output will be maximally positive or negative ; if they are in quadrature , the output will be zero .",
    "[ eqndemodquad ] shows that the @xmath70 oscillator components of the am and pm portions are orthogonal ( one is the real component , the other is imaginary ) so that the appropriate choice of electrical oscillator phase can force the readout of pm only , or am only , or some linear combination of the two .",
    "similarly , the demodulation quadrature of the @xmath71 stage determines the beat phase that the output signal is projected onto .",
    "the output dc component of the _ first _ stage of demodulation ( extracted with a bias - t component ) was used as an error signal for locking the optical recombination phase of the heterodyne .",
    "this error signal varies sinusoidally with respect to the optical recombination phase , with a zero crossing where the optical heterodyne beat ( @xmath66 ) and the electronic demodulation oscillator are in quadrature . in other words ,",
    "the feedback loop `` locks out '' the heterodyne beat . comparing eq .",
    "[ eqndetpower ] and eq .",
    "[ eqndemodquad ] , we see that the am term has the same phase as the @xmath66 term ( that is , they both contain the terms @xmath72 ) , so that the feedback loop also locks out the am component of modulation , leaving only the pm component ( which has a @xmath73 term ) .",
    "this is an important part of the process as , without a locking loop , the demodulation phase of the circuit would be uncharacterised , and would also be free to drift .    in the experiment ,",
    "two separate double demodulation schemes were used in order to measure pm and am simultaneously ; the @xmath70 signal was split with a @xmath74 electronic splitter to ensure that the two double demodulation circuits scanned orthogonal modulations . hence",
    ", when the heterodyne locking loop was connected using a signal from one double - demodulation circuit , this ensured that that particular circuit was sensitive to pm and that the other was sensitive to am .",
    "regarding the second stage of demodulation , electronically phase locking the signal generators was sufficient to time - stabilise the demodulation quadrature , and a known modulation was used for calibration .",
    "[ figoppoints ] shows spectrum analyser traces for four operating points , to demonstrate the suppression capabilities of the device .",
    "the suppression factors are 34.9  db and 39.5  db for the left- and right - hand sidebands ( fig .",
    "[ figoppoints](a ) and fig .",
    "[ figoppoints](b ) ) .",
    "the figures shown suppress the frequency lines down to the electronic noise floor , so that higher suppression factors may be possible . a more detailed trace exhibiting sideband suppression",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ figbestssb ] , with 35.2  db relative suppression recorded .",
    "we measured around 38  db suppression of the am beat compared with a similar - input - power pure - am state ( fig .",
    "[ figoppoints](c ) ) . in this and the other diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figoppoints ] , we have shown `` max - hold '' data , demonstrating that the device is highly stable , maintaining these operating points without significant drift on the timescale of hours .    in fig .",
    "[ figoppoints](d ) , the carrier is suppressed by selecting the am operating point and setting @xmath26 ( horizontal polarisation ) .",
    "the heterodyne measurement of the carrier is down by around 30  db , from which we can infer that the carrier power ( which goes as the square of the heterodyne measurement ) is down by 60  db .",
    "this heterodyne measurement is further supported by observing that the first and second harmonics of direct am beat are approximately equal , which is consistent with the fact that the carrier ( as measured by the heterodyne ) is approximately 6  db weaker than the sidebands .",
    "we were especially careful to validate this heterodyne measurement of the carrier , because the directly detected power only dropped by 40  db .",
    "the reason for this is that the majority of the residual carrier power was now in a higher - order , odd spatial mode ( easily verified by looking at the intensity profile of the beam ) , which did not interfere efficiently with the heterodyne oscillator beam .",
    "the higher - order modes were thought to result from a spatially non - uniform polarisation of the light exiting the utm which , when subsequently passed through a polarising beam splitter , produced modes reflecting the symmetry of the modulator . as such , for applications where spatial mode interference is important , the employment of a mode - cleaner cavity with free spectral range equal to the modulation frequency ( or one of its integer divisors ) should solve the problem .            in an attempt to confirm the variability of the utm prototype , we endeavoured to map significant paths in the modulation parameter space .",
    "[ figsweep1 ] and fig .",
    "[ figsweep2 ] show the result of sweeping through m - space in two cardinal directions : varying the relative phase between the two ( constant amplitude ) electrical signals ; and varying the amplitude of one electrical signal while keeping the other signal amplitude , and the relative phase , constant . for matters of calibration ,",
    "the utm was initially set to the pm operating point ( this initial state was used as the reference in labelling `` in - phase '' and `` quadrature '' components ) , and the relative gains and phases of the two double demodulation circuits were measured and factored out via correspondence with spectrum analyser data . the input polarisation was set to be elliptical with a vertical component slightly larger than the horizontal component .",
    "the results show that changing the phase between the two electrical signals produces am in quadrature to the original pm , whereas changing the amplitude of one electrical signal generates am in - phase with the original pm .",
    "the data points are generally in good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "some small systematic errors are apparent , and are thought to be associated with unmatched electrical and optical impedances between the two crystals , and possibly to do with slightly unmatched optical power levels probing each crystal ( ie a violation of our original assumption regarding polarisation states ) .",
    "overall , the device is shown to be highly predictable , and that one can `` dial - up '' a particular modulation state on call , having calibrated the device initially .    it is instructive to notice that the cardinal operating points are not evenly spaced when sweeping across the parameter space . in particular , we see that the two single - sideband operating points are shifted toward the am operating point in fig .",
    "[ figsweep1 ] , and the correlated pm & am operating point is similarly shifted in fig .",
    "[ figsweep2 ] , relative to the perpendicular .",
    "this is a product of the non - circular polarisation of light input into the modulator device , and can be understood by reviewing the modulation ellipses in the two figures ; the @xmath36 and @xmath37 axes intercept the ellipse at points that are closer to the am operating point than the pm .",
    "in fact , this provides us with a means of calibration of the relative transfer - function - amplitudes of the pm and am double - demodulation circuits : they are set by assuring that ( in fig .",
    "[ figsweep1 ] ) the pm and am components are equal at the phase @xmath75 where the single sideband is known to occur ( information which is obtained via comparison with spectrum analyser data ) .",
    "also , by using the identities in table i , we can derive a value of the polarisation parameter : @xmath76 .",
    "[ figoffsetlock ] shows scans of the local region near the pm operating point , with deviations in four directions .",
    "these data were taken with an offset locking application in mind , as discussed earlier .",
    "the in - phase pm component ( in - phase by definition ) is by far the dominant signal , and has been scaled down by a factor of 10 to fit in the graphs .",
    "as expected , the utm device can produce am that is in - phase with the present pm , or am that is in quadrature with the present pm , by changing the relative electrical signal amplitudes or phases respectively .",
    "in addition , both of these parameters can be varied together or oppositely , to give independent control over the two quadratures of am resulting . we note that in the case of producing both in - phase and quadrature am , a small component of quadrature pm appears ( in other words , the phase of the pm changes , relative to that of the pure pm point used for the initial calibration ) .",
    "in actual fact , the quadrature pm data has a noticeably larger systematic error than the other three signals .",
    "this is most likely due to pollution from its in - phase counterpart , caused by the demodulation oscillator s phase drifting marginally ( this was observed to happen even in spite of the electronic phase locking between signal generators ) .",
    "a number of experimental difficulties deserve mentioning .",
    "as described in the context of the carrier suppression results , the utm produced a spatially varying polarisation state , which produced a small percentage of higher - order spatial modes upon selecting out a polarisation component ( of order @xmath77 of the overall power ) .",
    "this interfered with our ability to directly measure the polarisation , which we did by measuring the overall detected power while rotating a diagnostic half - wave plate placed before the pbs . in this way , we measured a value of @xmath78 for the results shown in figs .",
    "[ figsweep1 ] to [ figoffsetlock ] , as compared to @xmath76 measured by inference from spectrum analyser data .",
    "we assign a reasonably large error to the direct measurement value due to the presence of the higher - order spatial modes , and we favour measuring @xmath3 by inference from the data .",
    "the overall optical path lengths of the modulating crystals were found to change significantly as they warmed up after starting the laser . the dual crystal design of the device goes a long way toward minimising this problem , and we have seen that the device is stable once it has warmed up . however , long term drift of the crystal lengths is possible , having a direct effect on the polarisation state leaving the device .",
    "we propose that , in circumstances where this becomes a problem , a feedback loop be employed to lock the polarisation state .",
    "a possible scheme would see the power level out of one pbs port monitored and used as a feedback signal ( minus an offset equal to the desired power level ) to the dc optical path length of one of the crystals , thus compensating for a mechanical path length change by feeding back to the refractive index .    finally ,",
    "the electrical impedances of the two crystals were not well matched for two reasons : the electronics were not identical ; and the crystals themselves had `` good '' and `` bad '' spots which generated varying levels of modulation . in general terms , careful alignment can largely overcome this problem and return the two crystals to an equal footing .",
    "the differing electrical impedances complicate the issue of generating a local oscillator with the phase - tracking property discussed earlier , since the voltages @xmath79 and modulation depths @xmath80 are not then related by the same factor .",
    "we submit that the device tested here is merely a prototype , and that careful management will suffice to deal with these issues as the need arises .",
    "we presented a thorough investigation , both theoretical and experimental , of a prototype universally tunable modulator ( utm ) .",
    "the electrical - to - optical transfer function of the device was derived , both in terms of electrical and optical phasor notation , and using a geometric phase `` modulation sphere '' representation .",
    "both pictures were shown to have merit , and a set of cardinal modulations were described in each notation .",
    "we reported on an experiment to characterise the prototype utm , which involved using dual double - demodulation circuits to measure both am and pm components simultaneously .",
    "data sets were obtained and analysed to illustrate the variability and purity characteristics of the device ; the device was shown to be highly predictable and capable of highly pure states .",

    "[ eqnapp5 ] and [ eqnapp6 ] constitute the general utm transfer function for arbitrary input polarisation .",
    "note that the pm component does not have the property of tracking the phase of the sum of the input electrical signals , since it generally depends on these inputs in different proportions .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we chose to restrict the polarisation to a subset .",
