    "<S> evidence for inelastic diffraction in dis is provided by the decrease @xcite of the average thrust angle ( `` alignment '' ) with increasing mass of the produced state @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> it is , accordingly , not surprising that the elastic diffraction obtained from ( [ ( 11 ) ] ) with the parameters employed for @xmath33 underestimates the measured cross section considerably , in particular for high values of the mass @xmath36 of the state @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> the above discussion of diffraction , in particular the sum rule ( [ ( 13 ) ] ) , suggests to introduce an upper limit @xcite in the integration over @xmath45 in @xmath46 . at finite energy @xmath32 , </S>",
    "<S> the diffractively produced mass spectrum is undoubtedly bounded by an upper limit that increases with energy . in our previous analysis @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we ignored such an upper limit , since the contribution of high masses seemed to be suppressed anyway . </S>",
    "<S> we have examined the effect of a cut - off , @xmath47 , in the momentum space version of ( [ ( 4 ) ] ) or , equivalently , in ( [ ( 13 ) ] ) . </S>",
