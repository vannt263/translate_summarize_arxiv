    "liner galaxies are a class of active galaxies characterized by the presence of strong , nuclear , low - ionization emission lines ( heckman 1980 ) . like seyfert nuclei , liners emit much stronger optical low - ionization forbidden lines compared to h  ii nuclei , whose line emission is powered by photoionization from young massive stars , but liners have a characteristically lower ionization state than seyferts . in a recent optical survey of nearly 500 nearby galaxies , ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1995 , 1997a , 1997b ) find that @xmath020% of all galaxies brighter than @xmath1 = 12.5mag display liner - type spectra .",
    "an additional 13% of the objects show spectra intermediate between those of `` pure '' liners and `` pure '' hii nuclei .",
    "ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1993 ; see also ho 1996 ) dubbed this class as `` transition objects , '' and they hypothesized that these might be composite systems in which the optical signal of a weak active nucleus ( the liner component ) has been spatially blended by circumnuclear star - forming regions ( the h  ii component ) .",
    "models have shown that photoionization by hot stars are able to reproduce the optical spectra of liners ( terlevich & melnick 1985 ) , especially those of the transition - type variety ( shields 1992 ; filippenko & terlevich 1992 ) .",
    "other researchers have advocated shock - wave heating as a viable excitation mechanism for liners ( fosbury 1978 ; heckman 1980 ; dopita & sutherland 1995 ) . at the same time , an increasing body of evidence suggests that a significant fraction of liners do contain irrefutable agn characteristics ( see reviews by filippenko 1996 and ho 1999b ) .",
    "radio surveys , in particular , have shown that many liners exhibit weak nuclear radio emission ( heckman 1980 ; sadler , jenkins , & kotanyi 1989 ; wrobel & heeschen 1991 ; slee 1994 ; falcke , wilson , & ho 1997 ; van dyk & ho 1998 ) . as discussed in detail by ho ( 1999a ) , weak nuclear radio emission in early - type ( elliptical and s0 ) galaxies",
    "is most likely related to accretion - driven energy production in these objects , but at a very low level compared to powerful radio galaxies , which are also usually hosted by early - type systems .",
    "radio observations provide an expecially attractive tool to further our understanding of the liner phenomenon .",
    "since radio frequencies are not plagued by dust obscuration and photoelectric absorption , high - resolution radio observations potentially offer the cleanest and most efficient method to isolate an agn core .",
    "although radio emission also arises from supernova remnants and hii regions , agn cores can be identified through their high degree of central concentration , small angular size , flat spectral indices , and high brightness temperatures .    given that liners are so numerous , they may be the most common type of agn known .",
    "their large space densities could make a major impact on the faint end of the local agn luminosity function , which in turn has ramifications for many astrophysical issues ranging from the cosmological evolution of agn to the contribution of agn to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "we are therefore conducting high - resolution radio observations of selected liner samples in order to investigate the interrelation between liners and classical agn .",
    "for the present paper  the first in a series  we have concentrated on transition - type liners",
    ". we report on sensitive very large array ( vla ) c - array observations of a sample of 25 such transition liners at 8.4ghz .",
    "the resulting images , having angular resolution of about 25 , allow us to assess the strength and spatial distribution of the nuclear radio emission . for comparison , we have also observed a small sample of 12 pure hii nuclei .    in the following discussion and in upcoming papers , we adopt a hubble constant of h@xmath2 = 75  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the sample of 25 transition liner / hii galaxies and 12 pure hii nuclei was extracted from the original magnitude - limited palomar survey of 486 bright northern galaxies ( ho 1995 ) , following the classification criteria outlined in ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the palomar sample contains 65 transition nuclei ( ho et al .",
    "1997a ) , from which we chose a subset of 25 that had little or no arcsec - scale resolution radio continuum data published , and that fell within the observation window assigned to us by the vla .",
    "in addition , we selected for comparison a small sample of 12 pure hii nuclei ( out of 206 such objects in the full palomar sample ) .",
    "these were chosen to mimic the hubble type distribution of the sample of transition objects , again taking into consideration scheduling constraints .",
    "we are not aware of any strong biases introduced by our sample selection .",
    "table  1 lists the 37 sample objects .",
    "in addition to the optical positions of the galaxies ( columns 3 and 4 ) , this table lists their distance ( column  5 ) and their hubble type ( column  6 ) . the hubble types and distances",
    "are taken from ho ( 1997a ) .",
    "the `` reference '' column ( 7 ) , together with table  2 , supplies references to earlier radio studies ; it is readily apparent that several of the sample objects are well - studied objects , while some are not .",
    "we will discuss our observational results in light of these existing data in section  4 .",
    "the sample galaxies span a wide range of hubble types , but the majority are spirals .    *  tables  1/2 : sample of transition liner galaxies and hii nuclei  *",
    "the resulting sample of 25 composite liner / hii and 12 pure hii galaxies was observed with the x - band ( 8.4ghz ) system of the vla in two observing sessions , on 1997 august  21 and august  25 .",
    "the array was in its c - configuration , yielding a typical resolution of 25 .",
    "two bands of 50mhz each were combined , yielding a total bandwidth of 100mhz .",
    "snapshot observations combining two scans of 89  minutes each , at different hour angles , were obtained in order to improve the shape of the synthesized beam .",
    "secondary phase and amplitude calibrators were observed before and after each scan .",
    "the primary calibrator was 3c286 , with appropriate baseline constraints , and the adopted 8.4ghz flux densities , as provided by the vla staff , were 5.22  jy and 5.20  jy , at if1 and if2 , respectively .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the absolute flux density of the primary calibrator , which is a few percent .",
    "the array performed well : judging from the calibration sources , the antenna phase and amplitude calibration appeared stable to within a few percent .",
    "the radio data are of high quality , and there was no need for extensive flagging of discrepant points .",
    "reduction of the data was performed using standard nrao aips ( version 15oct98 ) image processing routines .",
    "aips task imagr was employed to fourier transform the measured visibilities and obtain clean ( hgbom 1974 ; clark 1980 ) maps of the sources .",
    "full - resolution maps , having synthesized beams of roughly 25 , and tapered maps , having beams between about 5  and 12 , were made .",
    "this proved useful to detect weak low surface brightness emission .",
    "as a rule of thumb , 1  corresponds to 50100  pc for the typical distances involved .",
    "most images reach the theoretical noise level of @xmath4  mjy / beam ( perley , schwab , & bridle 1989 ) to within a factor of two .",
    "self - calibration was employed in the analysis of two of the stronger sources ( ngc4552 and ngc5354 ) , leading to considerable improvements .",
    "noting that a non - detection should be taken to imply no correlated flux density in excess of 0.5  mjy on the arcsec scale , radio contour maps of the detected galaxies are presented in figures 17 , at the end of the paper .",
    "the radio maps are overlayed on optical images taken from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) . in a number of cases only the high - resolution map ( typical beamsize 25 ) or the low - resolution map ( typical beamsize 7   10 )",
    "are shown .",
    "unrelated background radio sources were found in several fields ; their number is entirely as expected given the size of the primary beam and the sensitivity of the observations . in cases of large distances from the field center ,",
    "primary beam corrections were applied .",
    "some of the background sources have been identified using ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) and the cambridge apm ( automatic plate measuring ) facility . where possible",
    ", we have included them by their name in the tables below .",
    "previously uncatalogued background sources are designated by their sky orientation with respect to the field center for the relevant galaxy .",
    "all maps use contouring according to clev @xmath5 ( 3 , 3 , 6 , ... , mlev ) mjy / beam where mlev are powers @xmath6 up to a maximum of 96 and clev is the typical noise level on each radio map ( see table  3 ) .",
    "table  3 lists the various map parameters , with the following column headings : the source name ( 1 ) , the applied taper ( 2 ) , the resulting restoring beam ( 3 ) , the position angle of the beam ( 4 ) , the image noise level ( 5 ) , and the relevant figure number ( 6 ) .",
    "the hii nuclei appear at the bottom of the table .",
    "*  table  3 : radio map parameters  *    given that good phase stability was obtained , as judged from the vla phase calibrators , the astrometric accuracy of our overlay procedure must be dominated by the dss accuracy , which is known to be about 0.6   ( vron - cetty & vron 1996 ) .",
    "this is born out by the images of several unresolved and slightly resolved nuclei ( ngc4552 , ngc5354 , ngc5838 , ngc5846 ) which appear accurate to within a few tenths of an arcsec .      with reference to the images in the appendix ,",

    "the following objects have flat ( @xmath17 ) spectra : ngc4552 , ngc5354 , ngc5838 and ngc5846 and the hii nucleus in ngc4424",
    ". we will return to this issue in the next section .",
    "our vla imaging observations have yielded x - band detections of 27 of the 37 sample galaxies . these 27 include ngc4643 and ngc5012 , which were marginally detected . as for the non - detections",
    ", they are equally distributed over the transition liners and the hii nuclei .",
    "it appears that non - detection at x - band , at a resolution of 2512 , correlates with 1.4ghz ( nvss ) weakness and/or low surface brightness .",
    "table  6 indicates that the nvss radio luminosity distributions of the subsamples are comparable .",
    "the integrated 1.4ghz radio luminosities imply that the sample sources span the usual luminosity range for nearby galaxies ( 10@xmath18  10@xmath19 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 ; see , e.g. , condon 1987 , 1992 ) . with the exception of ngc4424 ( see section  4.2 ) , none of the hii nuclei display compact nuclear emission and/or a flat radio spectrum .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the transition liner galaxies .",
    "purely based on the radio morphology , the transition liner objects can be divided into two categories .",
    "the first is made up of galaxies displaying extended , steep - spectrum , low surface brightness radio emission , usually tracing the optical isophotes of the host galaxy .",
    "the second category refers to objects that , in addition to extended emission , also show compact nuclear radio emission .",
    "the first category displays radio morphologies that are consistent with their being due to large - scale star formation ; in several cases the radio morphology is seen to trace the hii regions in the host .",
    "however , we stress that the presence of a very weak nuclear component in these objects may still be masked by the more dominant radio emission from star - forming regions . the second category , which we will refer to in the following as agn candidates , is comprised of ngc3627 , ngc4552 , ngc5354 , ngc5838 , and ngc5846 .",
    "the last four of these are characterized with a flat radio spectral index between 1.4 and 8.4 ghz ( see end of section  4.3 ) .",
    "judging from high - resolution observations which isolate the nuclear emission , the compact nucleus of ngc3627 also displays a flat radio spectrum ( see section  4.2 ) .",
    "these agn candidates are on average more luminous than the non - agn and , as we shall see below , their hosts are early rather than late - type galaxies . while at first sight the hii nucleus ngc4424 also belongs in this agn candidate class , the radio image ( fig .",
    "3d ) shows it to be resolved .",
    "higher resolution observations recently carried out by us indeed resolve all the nuclear emission in ngc4424 ( see section  4.2 ) , in contrast to the agn candidates from the transition liner sample .",
    "as such there is a clear separation between the non - agn and agn candidate classes .",
    "apparently , galaxies with composite liner and star - formation spectra separate out into objects with and without a clear signature of an agn , that is to say , a compact , flat - spectrum radio source . the prime question to address , of course , is whether the optical spectra of these classes differ in any way . deferring the full analysis of this issue to another paper ,",
    "we here just note that the class of agn candidates indeed displays somewhat stronger [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] lines in their optical spectra . as we will demonstrate in the forthcoming paper in this series , the behavior of the so called @xmath20-parameter , which measures the radio / far - ir ratio , also supports the weak agn classification .",
    "however , like in the case of seyfert galaxies showing a @xmath030% incidence rate of compact radio cores ( e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1990 ) , there is not a one - to - one correspondence between compact radio emission and nuclear activity .",
    "we conclude that the radio properties permit to isolate agn candidates among the sample of transition liners , although the absence of radio cores can not be used to argue against their being agn .",
    "these conclusions strongly support the hypothesis which resulted from the vla observations of transition liner ngc7331 by cowan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    inspection of table  6 readily shows that these agn candidates are hosted by rather early - type galaxies ( e  sb ) .",
    "the relevant radio core luminosities l@xmath21 range from @xmath0 10@xmath22  10@xmath23 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 , which is several orders of magnitude less than the core luminosities in fri or frii type ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxies and quasars , and in the range of the weakest radio cores in seyfert galaxies ( giuricin et al .",
    "this , then , implies that weak liner agn preferentially occur in bulge - dominated hosts , not necessarily just in ellipticals , consistent with statistical results from other lines of evidence ( ho et al .",
    "1997b ; ho 1999b ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the case of seyfert galaxies , for which the radio core emission was also found to be stronger in early - type hosts ( giuricin et al .",
    "1996 ) . as such ,",
    "these weak agn differ from the more powerful fri radio galaxies , which are commonly associated with elliptical galaxies , not seldom brightest cluster galaxies ( zirbel & baum 1995 ) .",
    "they exceed the very weak nuclear source in the nearby transition liner ngc7331 ( cowan et al .",
    "1994 ) by a factor of @xmath24 , and are comparable in strength to the well - known variable radio core of the liner nucleus in m81 ( e.g. , ho et al . 1999 ) . hence , it must be concluded that at least some weak liner agn reveal themselves by low - power radio cores .",
    "this supports the analysis of ho ( 1999a ) , who proposed that the weak nuclear radio sources ( radio power 10@xmath18  10@xmath25 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 ) in nearby elliptical and s0 galaxies are the low - luminosity counterparts of more powerful agn .",
    "finally , it is intriguing that the transition liner in the elliptical galaxy ngc6482 remained undetected in our observations ( as well as in the nvss ) .",
    "given that ngc 6482 is the most distant object in our sample , our non - detection would still allow a @xmath26 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 compact radio source to reside in this object .",
    "full analysis of our sample , including optical emission - line and infrared luminosities , will be presented in forthcoming papers . to address the physical origin behind the findings presented here",
    "will be the challenge for future work .",
    "a sample of composite liner / hii galaxies and pure hii nuclei was studied using the vla ( c - array ) at 8.4ghz . on the basis of their radio",
    "morphological properties , the composite sources can be divided into objects with low surface brightness emission confined mainly to the plane of the galaxy and objects displaying compact nuclear components .",
    "the former objects are similar in radio morphology to the hii nuclei in our sample , whereas the latter show morphologies consistent with agn .",
    "all five of the liner agn are hosted by bulge - dominated galaxies ( hubble type e ",
    "sb ) , and four of them show flat spectral indices between 8.4 and 1.4ghz . in terms of radio luminosity ,",
    "the present liner agn populate the range of low core radio luminosities , which implies that classical agn of low luminosity exist in a wide range of galaxy types .",
