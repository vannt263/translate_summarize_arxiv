    "the search to directly image an extrasolar jovian planet requires contrast levels of @xmath310@xmath4 a few @xmath5 from the central star .",
    "scattered light in a telescope and the diffraction pattern of the telescope s aperture limit the contrast possible for direct detection of faint companions .",
    "the circular aperture of telescopes creates a sub - optimal diffraction pattern , the so - called airy pattern which is azimuthally symmetric .",
    "in addition , the intensity in the diffraction pattern of the circular aperture declines as @xmath6 . currently the best way to diminish the airy pattern is to use a coronograph by using the combination of a stop in the focal plane that rejects a majority of the central bright object s light and a lyot stop in the pupil plane to reject high frequency light @xcite .",
    "several recent ideas explore the use of alternative `` apodized '' apertures for high contrast imaging in the optical or near - infrared @xcite .",
    "these ideas revisit ideas first experimented with in the field of optics ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "apodizing an aperture rather than creating new technology to null or block a central bright object s light has several advantages .",
    "alignment of an object with an apodized aperture is not necessary , whereas for nulling interferometry or coronography it is essential .",
    "the cost of creating a shaped aperture is also quite low , if one makes the apodized aperture shape as a pupil mask in the optical train .",
    "this allows any current telescope to easily perform high contrast imaging .",
    "each telescope would then take images where the contrast would be only limited by atmospheric turbulence and scattered light in the optical system .",
    "a promising design for a shaped aperture was recently suggested by @xcite . in this case",
    "the top and bottom edges of the aperture are described by gaussian functions : @xmath7 -\\exp",
    "\\left(-\\alpha^{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } \\\\",
    "y_b & = & -b r\\left\\{\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\alpha x / r\\right)^{2}\\right ] -\\exp\\left(-\\alpha^{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 goes from @xmath9 .",
    "the fourier transform of the aperture shape function gives the resulting diffraction pattern in the imaging plane .",
    "since the fourier transform of a gaussian is another gaussian , the intensity of the diffraction pattern along one image plane axis decreases exponentially , which we denote the high contrast axis .",
    "the variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 are all free parameters that can be used to optimize the aperture for depth of contrast , the angle from the central object at which high contrast starts , and the azimuthal area of high contrast .    in order to test the performance of a gaussian aperture pupil mask on a telescope we designed a cold gaussian pupil mask and placed it in the optical train of the penn state near - ir imager and spectrograph ( piris ) for near - infrared imaging @xcite .",
    "figure [ pupilfig ] shows our pupil mask design .",
    "the placement of gaussian apertures avoided the support structure of the telescope to maximize contrast at the cost of halving the resolution of the images .",
    "throughput was also an issue , so to achieve roughly 25% throughput a total of 12 apertures were situated symmetrically in each quadrant of the pupil mask . to maximize the azimuthal coverage",
    "so that in any one image roughly half of the azimuthal area was in a high contrast region , we varied the height of the top and bottom of the apertures .",
    "full details of our design will be published in a future paper ( debes & ge 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "the current pupil design would be well suited for existing 10 m telescopes to look for faint companions separated from their parent stars by 5 au out to @xmath340 pc in the visible or @xmath310 pc for the near - ir limited only by atmospheric turbulence and scattered light in the telescope .",
    "scattered light is not a hard limit ; with a deformable mirror dedicated to correcting mirror surface errors , the levels of scattered light can be reduced by @xmath31 - 2 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we report here the first results of observations using the gapm to demonstrate the feasibility of using such a mask at an observatory . while the testing of optics with a gapm has been mentioned before ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , to our knowledge these are the first astronomical observations using a gapm for detecting faint companions . in section [ obs ] we will describe the observations we have done to date , and in section [ res ] we present our results .",
    "finally , in section [ dis ] we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "the stars @xmath1 eridani ( gj 144 = hd 22049 = hr 1084 , v=3.72 , d=3.2 pc ) and @xmath2 her a ( gj 695a = hd 161797 = hr 6623 , v=3.41 , d=8.4 pc ) were observed with the gapm . the star @xmath1 eridani was observed with seven 4s integrations in the k band , while @xmath2 her a was observed with one 3s and one 10s integration in the h band .",
    "both objects were also observed in normal imaging modes .",
    "the plate scale and orientation for piris was determined by measuring the positions of several stars in the orion nebula and comparing them to 2mass data .",
    "we find that the plate scale of piris is @xmath12 pixel@xmath13 .",
    "the gapm was aligned 23@xmath14 clockwise from north to line up with the support structure of the telescope .",
    "therefore , the axis of greatest contrast would be oriented perpendicular to the alignment of the mask or along a line running from the nw to the se in an image .    for our coronographic modes we used a stop in the focal plane that has a gaussian transmission function @xcite with a fwhm of @xmath31@xmath0 in an image .",
    "a lyot stop was placed in the pupil plane whose dimensions were chosen for an optimal combination of throughput and contrast ( ge & debes 2002 ; ftaclas 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a logarithmic scaled image of the psf of the gapm rotated so that the high contrast area is horizontal .",
    "the psf of the gapm is not azimuthally symmetric and the high contrast region extends roughly over 180@xmath15 .",
    "the majority of light in the diffraction pattern is spread into the four wings , leaving higher contrast regions between them . for comparison ,",
    "an image of the theoretical psf of the gapm is pictured .",
    "no faint companions were detected , but fairly stringent limits can be imposed on what kind of companions would have been detected between 1@xmath0 and 10@xmath0 from the central star in the high contrast regions .    in order to test the level of contrast achieved by the gaussian mask in comparison to other modes of piris , coronographic and adaptive optics observations were taken of the star+faint companion system gl 105 @xcite .",
    "figure [ contrast ] shows the differences in the three modes plus a simulation of the performance of our pupil mask design with no scattered light or atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the observations were azimuthally averaged in high contrast areas . for gl 105 , we azimuthally averaged the psf with the exception of 35@xmath15 on either side of the faint companion .",
    "the resulting profiles were then normalized to peak flux . further scaling had to be performed for the coronographic and gaussian pupil mask profiles . in these two cases the peak flux",
    "could not be determined due to the coronographic mask for gl 105 and due to saturation for @xmath1 eridani . in the case of gl 105 this problem",
    "was circumvented by the presence of the companion which was used to properly scale the flux .",
    "the error in the curve for the coronograph is due mostly to uncertainties in the positions and flux ratio of the companion and the central star , but should be no larger than on the order of 10% . in the case of @xmath1 eridani we took unsaturated images of a dimmer standard star and normalized",
    "the azimuthally averaged psf at .82@xmath0 .",
    "the profile of the gapm is a composite of those two sets of observations .",
    "the error in this normalization is dominated by variations in the psf and to estimate the effects of this we varied the point at which we normalized the two profiles .",
    "we found that at most the error introduced is of the order 25% .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ contrast ] , the gapm performs better than ao alone and is @xmath32 times worse than a traditional coronograph @xmath16 1@xmath0 .",
    "this is without any attempt to block the light of the central star .",
    "we discuss avenues for improving the performance of the mask in section [ dis ] .",
    "comparision of normalized contrast versus @xmath17 to other coronographs and to deep hst wfpc2 observations of @xmath1 eridani show that our gaussian pupil and coronographic mode performs similarly in terms of contrast to previous work done @xcite .",
    "it is also evident that several effects degrade contrast severely from the theoretical simulation .",
    "a large part of this degradation is due to the scattered light in the telescope and the ao .",
    "we discuss the possible causes of contrast degradation in section [ dis ] .    from the azimuthally averaged profiles , limits to the type of companions",
    "we could have detected around @xmath1 eridani can be estimated . beyond 4@xmath0 ( @xmath3 13 au ) , any companion with @xmath18 @xmath19 9.3 mag would have been detected , and at 8@xmath0 ( @xmath3 26 au ) any companion @xmath19 11.8 mag would have been detected .",
    "these translate to @xmath20 of 13.6 and 16.1 respectively .",
    "age is also an important consideration when talking about faint companions .",
    "the age of @xmath1 eridani is not well known , but should be @xmath19 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "a more recent evaluation on the data for @xmath1 eridani places the age at .73 @xmath21.2 gyr @xcite .",
    "we looked at the models of @xcite and @xcite to determine the range of possible companion masses that we could have detected based on .7 gyr and m@xmath22=13.6 and 16.1 , corresponding to 38@xmath218 m@xmath23 and 20@xmath215 m@xmath23 .",
    "we derived these estimates by taking a value intermediate to the two models , while the error represents their spread .      a faint companion around @xmath2 her a was detected with high s / n in both gapm and ao images .",
    "fig [ muher ] shows the raw h image which clearly shows the faint companion .",
    "this companion was previously detected in r and i band ao images at mt .",
    "wilson , and used to explain a radial velocity acceleration corresponding to a @xmath330 yr orbit @xcite .",
    "measurements of the separation from ao images were complicated by the saturation of @xmath2 her a , but the center position was calculated by fitting a gaussian profile horizontally and vertically to unsaturated parts of the psf .",
    "we measured the separation of the companion to be 1.@xmath03 @xmath21 @xmath0.2 ( @xmath3 11",
    "au ) with a p.a . of 184@xmath15 @xmath21 8@xmath15 .",
    "errors represent 2-@xmath24 .",
    "these measurements are consistent with those reported by @xcite , although we measure a change in p.a . of @xmath317@xmath15 . the proper motion of @xmath2 her a is -291.42 mas / yr in right ascension and -750.03 mas / yr in declination , which implies that a much larger change in separation would have been detected had the two objects not been bound @xcite .",
    "our observations confirm the dimmer object to be a proper motion companion and thus physically bound to the brighter star .",
    "the nature of the companion has previously been suggested to be substellar from monte carlo calculations of probable mass based on observed angular separation @xcite .",
    "however , the observed photometry of the companion and the age of the primary star do not support that conclusion .",
    "unfortunately , standard star measurements with the gapm could not be performed , but we took h and k photometry with the normal imaging mode of piris .",
    "we find that for the companion @xmath25=8.5 @xmath21 .1 and @xmath26=7.9 @xmath21 .1 , which corresponds to @xmath27=8.9 and m@xmath22=8.3 .",
    "the age of @xmath2 her a has been estimated to be 10.6 gyr by measurements of its magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "however , there is a dependence on such measurements based on the [ fe / h ] of the star .",
    "using @xcite s correction for metallicity and [ fe / h]=.15 from @xcite gives a corrected age of 4.2 gyr .",
    "@xcite reports a @xmath28=9.29 and @xmath29=7.26 between @xmath2 her a and its faint companion . taking the observed @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the central star from @xcite",
    "one derives for the faint companion @xmath30=12.18 and @xmath31=9.77 , corresponding to @xmath32=12.6 and @xmath33=10.2 . along with the age , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath27 , and @xmath20 of the companion",
    ", we used the models of @xcite to conclude that its mass should be @xmath3.13 m@xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that at this mass the r and i band is anamolously bright by .4 and 1.2 mag respectively , while both h and k observations match the models to within the errors .",
    "@xcite mentions that the opacity around 1@xmath2 m is not well known and when compared to observations , the models appear to overestimate the opacity in the r band , while underestimating opacity around the v band . in order to test this hypothesis",
    "@xcite arbitrarily increased the opacity in the v band and found an increase in flux in the i band .",
    "at the same time this uncertainty had little effect on the jhk bands .",
    "we therefore regard the h and k magnitudes to be a more reliable photometric indicator . even if the r and i magnitudes are a better measurement to compare to models , the companion is above the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "spectra of the companion would be valuable in definitively settling its identity .",
    "such transition objects are extremely useful for constraining low mass stellar models as well as determining the low mass end of the star formation rate .",
    "these observations represent the first attempt at high contrast imaging with a gapm . the relative ease and speed with which these first masks have been produced and their performance presents a promising technology that when mature may provide a viable alternative to coronography as a high contrast imaging mode . the fact that this preliminary attempt achieves contrasts similar to modern techniques in coronography while not blocking any of the central star s light is significant and encouraging for both ground based and space based attempts to directly image extrasolar planets .",
    "several factors have degraded the performance of the mask from reaching its theoretical sensitivities .",
    "our theoretical treatment of the mask neglects imperfect atmospheric correction , scattered light in the telescope , and the presence of a thermal background , all of which contribute to degrading the performance of the mask .",
    "images of the pupil plane ( including the gaussian mask ) show the presence of a small diffuse thermal background in the areas that have been blocked and should not emit light , on the order of 1% the peak flux coming through the gaussian openings .",
    "similarly , diffraction at the smallest openings of the gaussian aperture may wash out the gaussian shape and also significantly degrade contrast .",
    "perhaps the most significant degradation comes from the imperfect correction of the atmosphere in the ao system .",
    "all of these factors must be quantified fully , which will be explored in a forthcoming paper ( debes & ge 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "there are several ways to drastically improve the performance of the gapm .",
    "suppression of any thermal background , widening the opening of the aperture to reduce diffraction effects , and higher precision construction of the masks all are relatively quick ways to increase performance .",
    "additionally the gapm should be able to be combined with a coronographic mask in the focal plane .",
    "based on the performance of our coronographic modes that can suppress the light from the central star by about an order of magnitude , we would expect our gapm and coronographic mask to achieve sensitivities @xmath3 5 times better than the coronographic mask and lyot stop .",
    "longer term goals would be to design telescopes and instruments optimized for the suppression of excess scattered light and aberrations .",
    "we thank d. mccarthy for loaning part of the optics for piris , r. brown for the picnic array , c. ftaclas for coronographic masks , and a. kutyrev for filters .",
    "several important discussions with d. spergel were crucial in our understanding of gaussian apertures .",
    "we would also like to thank the invaluable help of the mt .",
