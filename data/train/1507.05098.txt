    "online instruments designed to measure social , psychological , and physical well - being at a population level are becoming essential for public policy purposes and public health monitoring  @xcite .",
    "these data - centric gauges both empower the general public with information to allow comparisons of communities at all scales , and naturally complement the broad , established set of more readily measurable socioeconomic indicators such as wage growth , crime rates , and housing prices .",
    "overall well - being , or quality of life , depends on many factors and is complex to measure  @xcite .",
    "existing techniques for estimating population well - being range from traditional surveys  @xcite to estimates of smile - to - frown ratios captured automatically on camera in public spaces  @xcite , and vary widely in the types of data they amass , collection methods , cost , time scales involved , and degree of intrusion .",
    "partly in response to policy makers desire for simple `` one number '' quantification of complex systems  arguably a general human proclivity  many measures are composite in nature .",
    "two examples are ( 1 ) the gallup well - being index , which is based on factors such as life evaluation , emotional health , physical health , healthy behavior , work environment , and basic access to necessary resources  @xcite ; and ( 2 ) the living conditions measure developed by the united states census bureau , which is derived from housing conditions , neighborhood conditions , basic needs met , a `` full set '' of appliances , and access to help if needed  @xcite .",
    "while such measures will always have their place , we venture that we must resist oversimplification .",
    "the dashboard of society should be just that  a rich set of incompatible instruments whose informational content may be observed individually and in total , not unlike the required input needed for flying a plane where knowledge of just a single number representing `` things are going well '' would be untenable .",
    "the construction of data - centric instruments for social systems that deliver more direct , interpretable measures is therefore of great importance as we move forward into the age of ubiquitous ( but not complete ) measurement .",
    "with the explosive growth of online activity and social media around the world , the massive amount of real - time data created directly by populations of interest has become an increasingly attractive and fruitful source for analysis . despite the limitation that social media users in the united states are not a random sample of the us population  @xcite , there is a wealth of information in these data sets and uneven sampling can often be accommodated .",
    "indeed , online activity is now considered by many to be a promising data source for detecting health conditions  @xcite and gathering public - health information  @xcite , and within the last decade , researchers have constructed a range of online public - health instruments with varying degrees of success .",
    "the maturing of these and related instruments along with theoretical models will ultimately fundamentally inform the limits of characterization and predictability of social systems .     in the next two subsections",
    ", we cover related research and then describe our approach to measuring the `` caloric content '' of text .       for a general overview of work relevant to our present effort",
    ", we briefly summarize related research concerning public health and well - being in connection with a range of social media and online data sets .    in the difficult realm of predicting pandemics",
    "@xcite , google flu trends  @xcite enjoyed early success and acclaim .",
    "initially based very simply on search terms , the instrument proved unsurprisingly to be imperfect and in need of a more sophisticated approach  @xcite .    in work by several of the current authors and colleagues ,",
    "et al . _",
    "measured the happiness of tweets across the us and found strong correlations with other indices of well - being at city and state level , such as the gallup well - being index ; the peace index ; the america s health ranking composite index of behavior , community and environment , policy and clinical care metrics ; and gun violence ( negative correlation )  @xcite . using the same instrument in 10 languages , the hedonometer , we have also shown that the emotional content of tweets tracks major world events  @xcite .",
    "paul and dredze found that states with higher obesity rates have more tweets about obesity , and states with higher smoking rates have more tweets about cancer  @xcite .",
    "they also found a negative correlation between exercise and frequency of tweeting about ailments , suggesting `` twitter users are less likely to become sick in states where people exercise . ''",
    "they further found health care coverage rates to be negatively correlated with likelihood of posting tweets about diseases .",
    "chunara _ et al .",
    "_  recently found that activity - related interests on facebook are negatively correlated with being overweight and obese , while interest in television is positively correlated with the same  @xcite .    in an analysis of online recipe queries , west _ et al .",
    "_  found that the number of patients admitted to the emergency room of a major urban hospital in washington , dc for congestive heart failure ( chf ) each month was significantly correlated with average sodium per recipe searched for on the web in the same month  @xcite .",
    "eichstaedt and colleagues  @xcite have demonstrated that psychological language on twitter outperforms certain composite socioeconomic indices in predicting heart disease at the county level . they were able to show in particular that the expression of negative emotions such as anger on twitter could be taken as a kind of risk factor at the population scale .     on a us county level",
    ", culotta  @xcite found that twitter activity provided a more `` fine - grained representation '' of community health than demographics alone with the prevalance of particular words that indicate , for example , television habits , or negative engagement .    finally , in work directly related to our present study , abbar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently performed a similar analysis of translating food terms used on twitter into calories .",
    "they found a correlation between twitter calories and obesity and diabetes rates for the us , and explored how food - themed interactions over social networks vary with connectedness , finding suggestions of social contagion .",
    "while our approach and results are largely sympathetic , our work incorporates estimates of physical activity which we will show provides essential extra information regarding health ; introduces a phrase extraction method we call serial partitioning ; and leads to an online implementation , paving the way for a real - time instrument as part of our proposed ` panometer . '",
    "we also note that we carried out our work concurrently and independently .      from the preceding list of studies ,",
    "it has become clear that we can estimate population - scale levels of health and well - being through social media . here",
    ", we examine the words and phrases people post publicly about food and physical activity on twitter on a statewide level for the contiguous united states ( 48 states along with the district of columbia ) . as we explain fully below in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fluxwell.calories ] and methods and materials , sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxwell.methods ] , we group categorically similar words and phrases into lemmas , and we then assign caloric values to these lemmas using the terms and notation `` caloric input '' for food , @xmath0 , and `` caloric output '' for activity , @xmath1 .",
    "we define the ratio of caloric output to caloric input to be a third quantity , `` caloric ratio '' : @xmath2 while we will focus largely on the three quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 , we will also explore `` caloric difference '' , an alternate combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 involving a single parameter : @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "we use `` phrase shifts ''  @xcite to show how specific lemmas  e.g .",
    ", `` apples '' , `` cake with frosting '' , `` white water rafting '' , `` knitting '' , and `` watching tv or movie '' contribute to the caloric texture of states across the contiguous us .",
    "we then correlate all three values with 37 measures relating to health and well - being , and we find statistically strong correlations with quantities such as high blood pressure , inactivity , diabetes levels , and obesity rates .",
    "for ease of language , we will generally speak of phrases rather than lemmas .",
    "we have also generated an accompanying online , interactive instrument for exploring health patterns through the lens of `` twitter calories '' : the lexicocalorimeter .",
    "an initial , fixed version of the instrument may be accessed at this paper s online appendices , http://compstorylab.org/share/papers/alajajian2015a/ , with a evolvable , production version housed within our larger measurement platform http://panometer.org at http://panometer.org/instruments/lexicocalorimeter ( all code for these sites can be found at https://github.com/andyreagan/lexicocalorimeter-appendix ) .",
    "we note that while our online instrument is based on twitter , it may in principle be used on any sufficiently large text source , social media or otherwise , such as facebook .    from this point , we structure the core of our paper as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : fluxwell.results ] , we establish and discuss our findings in depth .",
    "specifically , we : ( 1 ) outline our text analysis of a twitter corpus from 20112012 sec .",
    "[ subsec : fluxwell.calories ] ) , reserving full details for methods and materials in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxwell.methods ] ; ( 2 ) present caloric maps of the contiguous us contrasting the 48 states and dc through histograms and phrase shifts ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : fluxwell.maps ] ) ; and ( 3 ) examine how @xmath0 , @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath6 correlate with a suite of measures relating to health and well - being . in the supporting information , we provide a sample of confirmatory figures as well as all shareable data sets ( e.g. , ids for all tweets ) .",
    "we offer concluding thoughts in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxwell.conclusion ] .",
    "we used all available geotagged tweets from 2011 and 2012 ( around 50 million ) from a bounding box of the contiguous us , using twitter s garden hose sample ( which is a sample of approximately 10   including those that are not geotagged ) and the geotag feature to determine from which of the 48 continental states and the district of columbia each tweet came . from this sample",
    ", we counted the total number of times each food and physical activity phrase in our database was tweeted about in each of the 48 continental states and the district of columbia ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxwell.methods ] and s1 dataset ) .",
    "we then used these counts to determine the average caloric input @xmath0 from food phrase tweets and the average caloric output @xmath1 from physical activity phrase tweets as follows .",
    "first , we equate each food phrase @xmath7 with the calories per 100 grams of that food , using the notation @xmath8 .",
    "( we also explored serving sizes but the databases available proved far from complete . )",
    "we then compute the caloric input for a given text @xmath9 as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the frequency of phrase @xmath7 in text @xmath9 , @xmath12 is the normalized version , and @xmath13 is the set of all food phrases in our database .",
    "second , for each tweeted physical activity phrase , we use an estimate of the metabolic equivalent of tasks , or mets , which we then converted to calories expended per hour , assuming a weight of 80.7 kilograms , the average weight of a north american adult  @xcite .",
    "analogous to @xmath14 above , we then have @xmath15 where now @xmath16 is the set of all phrases in our activity database .",
    "we emphasize that both our food and exercise phrase data sets and twitter databases are necessarily incomplete in nature .",
    "the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are thus not meaningful as absolute numbers but rather have power for comparisons .",
    "we also acknowledge that our equivalences are crude  e.g .",
    ", each mention of a specific food is naively turned into the calories associated with 100 grams of that food  and later on we address our choices in more depth .",
    "nevertheless , our method is pragmatic yet  as we will show  effective , and offers clear directions for future improvement .    for simplicity and ultimately",
    "because the results are sufficiently strong , we did not filter tweets beyond their geographic location .",
    "tweets may thus come from individuals , restaurants , sports stores , resorts , news outlets , marketers , fitness apps , tourists , and so on , and further improvements and refinements may be achieved by appropriately constraining the twitter corpus .    finally , we take the ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath14 to obtain the text s caloric ratio @xmath18 . in general , we observe that a higher value of @xmath18 at the population scale would appear to be intuitively better , up to some limit indicating negative energy balance .",
    "we note that @xmath19 is not salient and should not be taken to mean a population is ` balanced calorically ' .",
    "as we discuss later , using the difference , what we call caloric difference , a generalization of @xmath20 , generates similar results but , from a framing perspective , we have reservations in creating a scale with a 0 point given the approximate nature of our measures .                in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxwell.maps - dominantmodes ] , we show two choropleth maps of our overall 20112012 measures of twitter s caloric input @xmath0 and caloric output @xmath1 . for both maps and those that follow ,",
    "quantities increase as colors move from light to dark green .",
    "these maps immediately allow for some basic observations which we will delve into and harden up as our analysis proceeds . for the food calories map , we see @xmath0 is generally largest in the midwest and the south while colorado and maine stand out as states with the lowest calories .    we see a different texture in the activity calories map with the highest caloric output according to our measure appearing in the three - state block of wyoming , colorado , and utah , as well as vermont .",
    "tweet - based caloric output drops to a low in mississippi and the surrounding states , while michigan also appears to have a low value of @xmath1 .    for the food and activities maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxwell.maps - dominantmodes ] , we also show the most dominant phrase for each population s @xmath0 and @xmath1 scores . almost uniformly ,",
    "`` pizza '' ( high calorie food ) and `` watching tv or movie '' ( low calorie activity ) are the lemmas with the largest contributions , a function of both volume and caloric scores . only mississippi ( `` ice cream '' ) and wyoming ( `` cookies '' ) are exceptions , though `` pizza '' is still near the top for both .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxwell.maps - diffs ] , we present the same choropleth maps from fig .  [",
    "fig : fluxwell.maps - dominantmodes ] , but now with the phrase most distinguishing a population .",
    "specifically , we show phrases whose increased prevalence most contributes to moving a population s twitter calorie scores away from the overall average for the contiguous us . for example , if a population s @xmath0 is above average , we find the food phrase whose frequency coupled with its caloric content most strongly moves the population s",
    "@xmath0 up from the average .",
    "( we explain in full how we determine these phrases later with phrase shifts in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fluxwell.phraseshifts ] . )",
    "we now see a diverse spread of terms .",
    "we find a number of phrases make for reasonable representations :              * `` eating '' rising to the top in texas , the south , and a number other states ; * `` watching tv or movie '' in pennsylvania and elsewhere ; * `` sitting '' in tennessee ; * `` talking on the phone '' in delaware ; * `` getting my nails done '' in new jersey ; * and simply `` lying down '' in michigan .",
    "now , we do not pretend that these phrases all come from individuals diligently recording their present meals or activities .",
    "apart from tweets from individuals , our database contains tweets from companies , advertisers , resorts , and so on .",
    "and some phrases are problematic in their generality of meaning , most especially `` running '' ( the word `` run '' currently has the most meanings in the oxford english dictionary ) .",
    "nevertheless , as we dig deeper into all the phrases found for a particular state , we will continue to find commonsensical lexical patterns .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxwell.maps - calrat ] , we show a choropleth map for caloric ratio , @xmath3 . we see that the highest values of @xmath3 are found in colorado , wyoming , and vermont , and secondarily for maine , minnesota , oregon , and utah .",
    "low values of @xmath3 appear in the region comprising mississippi , louisiana , alabama , and arkansas , as well as west virginia .    an initial visual comparison of of figs .",
    "[ fig : fluxwell.maps - dominantmodes ] and [ fig : fluxwell.maps - calrat ] , suggest that @xmath1 is more well aligned with @xmath3 than @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that for the present version of the lexicocalorimeter , @xmath1 has a larger dynamic range than @xmath0 , roughly 250 to 285 versus 160 to 210 giving ratios of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we could assert that @xmath0 is fundamentally less informative but :    1 .   in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fluxwell.othermeasures ] , we will find that some measures relating to health and well - being correlate more strongly with @xmath0 and some with @xmath1 ; 2 .",
    "we may adjust the dynamic range of either measure by rescaling , introducing a kind of tunability  @xcite to the instrument ( a feature we will reserve for future iterations ) ; and 3 .   because our food phrase database is a factor of 10 smaller than our activity phrase one , revisions of our instrument",
    "may elevate the power of @xmath0 .     and",
    "caloric output @xmath1 , demonstrating their separate value as they bear different kinds of information .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath23 is -0.13 and the best line of fit slope is @xmath24 -1.64 .",
    "[ fig : fluxwell.scatterplots ] adds plots of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . ]    to provide some support for point 1 , we compare @xmath1 and @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxwell.scatterplot_calin_calout ] ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : fluxwell.scatterplots ] ) .",
    "importantly , we see that the two measures are indeed not well correlated , indicating they contain different kinds of information ( pearson correlation coefficient @xmath25 , @xmath26-value = 0.39 ) .",
    "this demonstrates why we might expect @xmath0 or @xmath1 to separately correlate more strongly with other population - level measures , and justifies forming a dashboard using both @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well the composite measure of @xmath3 .",
    "regarding point 2 above , we have evidently made a number of choices in computing @xmath0 and @xmath1 that mean we have already introduced an arbitrary tuning of the ratio @xmath3 ( e.g. , assuming 100 grams of a food and an hour s worth of activity ) . having no principled way of rescaling ( i.e. , one that is not a function of the data",
    "set being studied ) , we have chosen to leave the measures as computed . as we discuss later , in future iterations we envisage for the caloric difference version that introducing tunability of the dynamic ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath1altering the bias of the measure toward food or activity  will allow the lexicocalorimeter to be refined for a range of purposes such as estimating correlates of diabetes levels versus cancer rates ( see sec .",
