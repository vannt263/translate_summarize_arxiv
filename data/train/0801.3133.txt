    "mond is an alternative paradigm to newtonian dynamics , whose original motivation was to explain the mass discrepancies in galactic systems without invoking dark matter ( dm ) ( milgrom 1983a ) .",
    "it constitutes a modification of dynamics in the limit of low accelerations that rests on the following basic assumptions : ( i ) there appears in physics a new constant , @xmath0 , with the dimensions of acceleration .",
    "( ii ) taking the formal limit @xmath1 in all the equations of physics restores the equations of classical ( pre - mond ) dynamics .",
    "( iii ) for purely gravitational systems , the opposite , deep - mond limit , @xmath2 , gives limiting equations of motion that can be written in a form where the constants @xmath0 and @xmath3 , and all masses in the problem , @xmath4 , appear only in the product @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( milgrom 2005 ) , @xmath7 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and gravitational field degrees of freedom , we can rewrite them , possibly by redefining the gravitational field , so that only @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and the gravitational field appear . ] .",
    "this last fiat reproduces the desired mond phenomenology for purely gravitational systems .",
    "a mond theory is one that incorporates the above tenets in the nonrelativistic regime .    since all our knowledge of mond comes , at present , from the study of purely gravitational systems ( galactic systems , the solar system , etc .",
    ") it is still an open question how exactly to extend the third mond tenet to systems involving arbitrary interactions .",
    "one possibility is to require that for @xmath10 , the limiting equations of motion can be brought to a form where @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath4 appear only as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this requirement will automatically cause @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 to appear as @xmath9 in the deep mond limit of purely gravitational systems , as in such cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 always appear in equations as @xmath13 .",
    "such a general requirement would also replace newton s second law @xmath14 by @xmath15 in the deep mond regime , where @xmath16 is some functional with dimensions of acceleration squared that does not depend on @xmath0 .    detailed reviews of phenomenological and theoretical aspects of the paradigm can be found , for instance , in sanders and mcgaugh ( 2002 ) , and , more recently , in scarpa ( 2006 ) and in bekenstein ( 2006 ) .",
    "it follows from the third tenet that an underlying mond theory must be nonlinear in the sense that an acceleration of a test particle due to a combination of several fields is not simply the sum of the accelerations produced by the individual fields .",
    "take , as an example , the purely gravitational case where we modify the equations for the gravitational field .",
    "linearity would mean that in the nonrelativistic limit of the theory the acceleration of a test particle at position @xmath8 in the field of @xmath17 masses @xmath4 at positions @xmath18 is given by = _",
    "i=1^n m_i q_i(g , , , _",
    "the third assumption says that in the deep mond case @xmath19 , but this is dimensionally impossible .",
    "clearly , the acceleration produced even by a single point can not be linear in its mass , as we shall see explicitly below .",
    "it also follows from the third tenet , and the assumption that @xmath0 is the only new dimensioned constant , that the deep mond limit of any theory must satisfy the following scaling laws for purely gravitational systems : in general , on dimensional grounds , all physics must remain the same under a change of units of length @xmath20 , of time @xmath21 , and no change in mass unit @xmath22 . under",
    "these we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; so , the constant @xmath25 , which alone appears in the limiting theory , is invariant under the scaling .",
    "this tells us that we are , in fact , exempt from scaling the constants of the theory when we scale @xmath26 .",
    "the theory is thus invariant under this scaling ; namely , if a certain configuration is a solution of the equations , so is the scaled configuration .",
    "specific theories may have even higher symmetries ; for example , the above scaling property is only part of the conformal invariance of the deep mond limit for the particular mond theory of bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) , as found in milgrom ( 1997 ) .    as a corollary of the scaling invariance",
    "we have : if @xmath27 is a trajectory of a point body in a configuration of masses @xmath4 at positions @xmath28 ( which can be taken as fixed , for example ) , then @xmath29 is a trajectory for the configuration where @xmath4 are at @xmath30 , and the velocities on that trajectory are @xmath31 .",
    "( an extended mass changes its size and density such that the total mass remains the same .",
    "a point mass remains a point mass of the same value . )    since @xmath25 has dimensions of @xmath32 , another scaling under which it is invariant is @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "( the most general scaling allowed is @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . )",
    "this means that for a purely gravitational system deep in the mond regime , scaling all the masses leaves all trajectory paths the same but the bodies traverse them with all velocities scaling as @xmath39 ; accelerations then scale as @xmath40 .",
    "it is enlightening to draw an analogy between the role of @xmath0 in mond with the role of @xmath41 in quantum physics , or that of @xmath42 in relativity .",
    "these constants , each in its own realm , mark the boundary between the classical and modified regimes ; so formally pushing these boundaries to the appropriate limits ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath1 ) one restores the corresponding classical theory ( for quantum theory , in some weak sense ) .",
    "in addition , these constants enter strongly the physics in the modified regime where they feature in various phenomenological relations . for example",
    ", @xmath41 appears in the black body spectrum , the photoelectric effect , atomic spectra , and in the quantum hall effect .",
    "the speed of light appears in the doppler effect , in the mass vs. velocity relation , and in the radius of the schwarzschild horizon . without the respective , underlying theory , these disparate phenomena would appear totally unrelated , and the appearance of the same numerical constant in all of them would constitute a great mystery .",
    "the mond paradigm similarly predicts a number of laws related to galactic motion , some of which are qualitative , but many of which are quantitative and involve @xmath0 .",
    "since they appear to be obeyed by nature it should indeed be a great mystery why that should be so without the underlying mond paradigm ( i.e. with newtonian dynamics plus dm ) .",
    "i now discuss some of these predictions in some detail .",
    "a mond theory based on the above basic premises should predict everything about the acceleration field of an object , such as a galaxy , based on the baryon distribution alone .",
    "but even before looking at detailed predictions for individual systems , it is possible and useful to distil a number of corollaries that follow essentially from the basic premises themselves .",
    "this helps focus attention on some unifying , general laws , which may be likened to kepler s laws of planetary motion .",
    "mond , of course , predicts more then just these laws .",
    "i list some such relations below and explain how they come about .",
    "it is important to realize that some of these actually contradict the predictions of cdm , and that those that do not are independent in the context of dm .",
    "they are so in the sense that one can construct galaxy models with baryons and dm that satisfy any set of these predictions but not any of the others .",
    "so , in the context of dm each would require a separate explanation .",
    "the mond predictions concerning the mass discrepancies in galactic systems depend only on the present day baryon distribution .",
    "in contrast , the expected discrepancies ; i.e. , the relative quantities and distributions of baryons and dm in such systems depend strongly on their unknown ( and unknowable ) formation history , a point which i expand on in section [ section9 ] .",
    "in deriving the predictions below i assume that the theory involves only @xmath0 as a new dimensioned constant .    *",
    "the orbital speed around an arbitrary isolated mass becomes independent of the radius of the orbit in the limit of very large radii .",
    "this means , in particular , that the rotational velocity on a circular orbit becomes independent of the orbital radius at large radii ",
    "asymptotic flatness of rotation curves : @xmath45 .",
    "this quantitative behavior was the cornerstone on which mond was built ; so it was introduced by hand , based on anecdotal evidence existing at the time .",
    "but once taken as axiom of mond it has become a binding prediction .",
    "it follows straightforwardly from the above length - time scaling property of the deep mond limit follows from the fact that masses and g always appear in the combination @xmath46 , which is invariant under @xmath47 , @xmath48 , under which @xmath49 . ] ; but it is worthwhile seeing an explicit derivation : on dimensional grounds , the acceleration of a test particle on an arbitrary orbit around a point mass , @xmath50 , when it is at a distance @xmath51 on the orbit , has to scale with @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a~mgr^2(,mgr^2 ) , where @xmath52 can depend , through some dimensionless parameters @xmath53 , on the geometry of the orbit and on the position on the orbit that is bounded in a volume of size @xmath54 , all that enters the motion of a test particle at large radii ( @xmath55 ) is @xmath50 , while the exact spatial distribution of the mass is immaterial . in other words ,",
    "i assume that the motion of a test particle in the field of a point mass is independent of the way the limit of the point mass is taken .",
    "this is certainly true for modified inertia theories in which the gravitational field equation is the standard one . for modified gravity theories",
    "it seems an obvious assumption , but , in principle , it has to be checked ( it does hold for all the theories studied to date ) . ] . from the basic premises of mond we must have : + ( , y)\\ { + l@ : l 1 & y1 + ( ) y^-1/2 & y1 + ..",
    "+ this means that at large @xmath51 we have @xmath56 .",
    "this , in turn , means that the orbital speed is given by + v(m , r,)=()(mg)^1/4=()(m/)^1/4 , and is thus invariant to scaling of the orbit .",
    "this holds for any mond theory ( be it modified gravity or modified inertia ",
    "see below ) and for any orbit . for circular orbits in an axisymmetric potential @xmath57 has to be constant as it can not depend on orbital phase .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is normalized so that for circular orbits @xmath58 .",
    "+ the function @xmath52 is one example of the appearance of a so called interpolating function in mond [ the name is usually reserved for the function @xmath59 related to @xmath60 by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the inverse of @xmath63 .",
    "in some formulations of mond ( as in modified gravity  see below ) there is a single interpolating function that appears in the theory .",
    "in other formulations there is nt a unique one ( as , for example here , where @xmath60 can depend on @xmath53 , in general ) . in a given context it interpolates between the known behaviors in the deep mond regime and the classical ( pre mond ) regime .",
    "* mond predicts a relation between the total mass of a body and the asymptotic circular velocity around it .",
    "it follows from eq.([lul ] ) that @xmath64 ( milgrom 1983b )",
    ". this can be tested directly for disc galaxies ( see confirming analysis in mcgaugh et al . 2000 , mcgaugh 2005a , b ) .",
    "this predicted mass - asymptotic - speed relation is in the basis of the traditional , empirical tully - fisher ( tf ) relation between galaxy luminosity and rotational speed , from which , however , it differs in essence .",
    "one finds in the literature various empirical plots that are termed tf relations , between some luminosity measure and some velocity measure .",
    "many of these plots are not useful for comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "mond dictates exactly what should be plotted : the total baryonic mass against the rotational velocity on the flat part of the rotation curve  aka the baryonic tully - fisher ( tf ) relation . using ,",
    "as in the original tf relation , the luminosity as a mass measure will not do ; at best , it represents only the stellar mass , leaving out the gas mass .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ] ( see also milgrom & braun 1988 ) where a tight relation is followed only for high mass galaxies , which are dominated by stellar mass .",
    "the same relation holds for lower mass galaxies , which are gas rich , only if we include the gas mass .",
    "note also that the use of a velocity measure that is heavily weighted by smaller radii ( e.g. optical velocity measures ) artificially distorts the mass - velocity plot , introducing artificial scattering and biasing the slope of the relation : for low mass galaxies the inner velocities are , typically , smaller than the asymptotic ones , while for high mass galaxies the opposite is true .",
    "+ [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     in a dm interpretation of mond one will then conclude that the haphazard and small amount of leftover baryons in galaxies determine so many of the properties of the dominant dm halo , with such accuracy as evidenced by mond .",
    "i deem it highly inconceivable that dm will ever reproduce the predictions of mond and the relations it predicts for individual systems .",
    "achieving this within the complex scenario of galaxy formation would be akin to predicting the detailed properties of a planetary system  planet masses , radii , and orbits  from knowledge of only the present day central star .",
    "when we find a tight relation between system properties in astronomy  such as the zero - age main sequence for non - rotating , nonmagnetic stars of a given composition ",
    "it results inescapably from laws of physics .",
    "we can not conceive of an incipient star ( non - rotating , non - magnetic , etc . )",
    "that does not sit on the main sequence ; we can not conceive of a galaxy in mond that does not satisfy the mond laws ; but we can easily conceive of such a galaxy in the newtonian dynamics plus dm paradigm .    indeed , to my knowledge none of the mond predictions listed in section [ section2 ] has been shown to follow in the dm paradigm .",
    "( i discount the attempt by kaplinghat and turner 2002 to explain prediction 3 , for the reasons i gave in milgrom 2002b . )    for example , it is being claimed that lcdm predicts a tully - fisher relation not unlike what is observed .",
    "this , however , is not really true . what lcdm predicts is a relation between the total halo mass and its maximum circular - orbit velocity . in earlier times",
    "it could be assumed with impunity that the ratio of total baryons to total dm mass in galaxies is universal ( and equal to the cosmological value ) .",
    "this would have given a relation between the baryon mass and the rotational velocity for the halo .",
    "however , the assumption of a universal baryon fraction is now known not to follow in the cdm picture , and , as we saw , this fraction is typically much smaller than the putative cosmological value . not only is nt the general correlation predicted , but the processes that caused only a small fraction of the original baryons to show up in present day galaxies are likely to have produced large scattering in this ratio , and hence in the predicted baryon - mass - velocity relation , unlike what is observed .",
    "( simulations that include baryons are very ad hoc , and introduce many assumptions by hand . clearly , true simulations of baryon behavior in this context are far beyond the offing . )    regarding the ability of dm models to fit rotation curves of disc galaxies : apart from the well known lingering problem of fitting the inner parts of galactic rotation curves ( the `` cusp problem '' ) , halos predicted by lcdm ( with , e.g. , nfw profiles ) can , by and large , fit the observed curves , but only if one leaves free their mass and size parameters .",
    "such fits then involve three parameters : the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( the only parameter used in mond fits ) plus the two structural parameters for the halo , which afford great freedom in reconstructing rotation curves .",
    "however , in lcdm simulations the two structural parameters are not free , but come out strongly correlated . if one actually uses the halo profiles predicted by lcdm , with that correlation enforced , the rotation curve fits are bad , even though they still have the freedom of an additional halo parameter vis - a - vis mond ( e.g. , mcgaugh et al .",

    "dark matter advocates themselves invoke `` baryon - less '' galaxies when they want to explain the `` missing satellite '' problem for cdm . but",
    "this would then contradict the existence of strict relations between baryons and dm , which they would have to invoke to explain mond predictions within the dm paradigm .",
    "the blanket is too short to cover both ends .    to recapitulate , the confirmations of the mond predictions ",
    "those listed in section [ section2 ] and those concerning the full rotation curves  argue against the newtonian - dynamics - plus - dm paradigm in two ways . first , since they supports mond as a competing paradigm .",
    "second , because in themselves , and without reference to mond , these regularities point to a strong baryon - dm connection in which baryons determine completely the distribution of dm in a many well defined and independent ways , and object by object .",
    "this would clearly fly in the face of the expectations from dm in which the relation between baryons and dm is haphazard and strongly dependent on the history of each object .",

    "<S> i review briefly different aspects of the mond paradigm , with emphasis on phenomenology , epitomized here by many mond laws of galactic motion  analogous to kepler s laws of planetary motion . </S>",
    "<S> i then comment on the possible roots of mond in cosmology , possibly the deepest and most far reaching aspect of mond . </S>",
    "<S> this is followed by a succinct account of existing underlying theories . </S>",
    "<S> i also reflect on the implications of mond s successes for the dark matter ( dm ) paradigm : mond predictions imply that baryons alone accurately determine the full field of each and every individual galactic object . this conflicts with the expectations in the dm paradigm because of the haphazard formation and evolution of galactic objects and the very different influences that baryons and dm are subject to during the evolution , as evidenced , e.g. , by the very small baryon - to - dm fraction in galaxies ( compared with the cosmic value ) . </S>",
    "<S> all this should disabuse dm advocates of the thought that dm will someday be able to reproduce mond : it is inconceivable that the modicum of baryons left over in galaxies can be made to determine everything if a much heavier dm component is present . </S>"
