    "<S> voltage control of magnetic anisotropy ( vcma ) in multiferroics can be realized by strain transfer from a ferroelectric or piezoelectric layer to a ferromagnetic film , as the deformation of the ferromagnet changes the magnetoelastic anisotropy _ via _ inverse magnetostriction.@xcite    recently , the influence of electric - field induced strain on magnetic anisotropy has been demonstrated in a variety of unpatterned and patterned multiferroic heterostructures including batio@xmath0/fm @xcite , pmn - pt / fm @xcite and pzn - pt / fm @xcite with fm = ni @xcite , nife @xcite , nico @xcite , co @xcite , cofe @xcite , cofeb @xcite , fe @xcite , fegab @xcite , and fe@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the bottom side of the crystal was covered by a 5 nm ti/50 nm au layer , in order to apply high voltage perpendicular to the piezoelectric substrate . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , nife microstrips of 1.5 , 2.6 , 6.7 m width and 90 m length along the [ 01 - 1 ] direction of the pmn - pt crystal were fabricated using electron beam lithography and ion - beam etching . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was vacuum annealed at 330@xmath6c in an in - plane magnetic field to increase the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the dc resistance of the respective strips was : 842 @xmath7 , 576 @xmath7 , 201.5 @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> a radio frequency ( rf ) current of amplitude @xmath8 , flowing through the nife strips deposited on the pmn - pt substrate , generates a time - dependent spin transfer torque ( stt ) and oersted field . </S>",
    "<S> these effects lead to magnetization dynamics and , because of amr , resistance oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> mixing of the oscillating current and resistance generates a dc sd voltage @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of this signal is proportional to the real part @xmath10 of the complex amplitude of the resistance change,@xcite @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the amr effect is given by : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) denote the resistance of the strip when the magnetization is perpendicular ( parallel ) to the current . </S>",
    "<S> the change in resistance due to a small change in the angle @xmath16 between magnetic moment and current is thus given by @xmath17 . from this , one finds @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath19 represents the real part of the complex angular changes .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the magnetization dynamics responsible for the @xmath9 signal is driven by the uncompensated oersted field and by the stt effect . </S>",
    "<S> even for a single - layer ferromagnetic strip , an uncompensated oersted field can be induced , since electron scattering processes at both interfaces are generally different . </S>",
    "<S> the stt , on the other hand , may appear due to some inhomogeneities of the magnetization distribution within the permalloy strip.@xcite small changes of the angle @xmath16 can be derived from the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation for a unit vector along the magnetization @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a damping constant ( of the order of @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 is a torque acting on the magnetic moment @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the gyromagnetic ratio . the second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : gama ] corresponds to the stt effect . </S>",

    "<S> 3 . is the magnetostriction constant . </S>",
    "<S> the electric field - dependent stress @xmath41 acting on permalloy in the [ 100 ] and [ 01 - 1 ] directions can be calculated from the relation between the strain of the pmn - pt substrate and the applied electric field , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the strain of the pmn - pt along the @xmath44 direction ( @xmath45,[01 - 1]$ ] ) , @xmath46 is a matrix of piezoelectric constants , and @xmath47 is the electric field applied in the @xmath48 direction ( @xmath49 $ ] ) . since the electric field is applied perpendicularly to the substrate ( in [ 011 ] direction ) , </S>",
    "<S> the only strains that influence the permalloy microstrip are those in [ 100 ] and [ 01 - 1 ] directions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the relation between the strain within pmn - pt and stress transmitted to permalloy can be written as:@xcite    @xmath50}(e ) = \\frac{y(d_{31}+\\nu d_{32 } ) } { ( 1-\\nu^2 ) } e_{[011 ] } , \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\sigma_{[100]}(e ) = \\frac{y(d_{32}+\\nu d_{31 } ) } { ( 1-\\nu^2 ) } e_{[011]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where y=200 gpa is the young s modulus , and @xmath51 is poisson s ratio of nife.@xcite from the above equations one can see that stresses in both in - plane directions ( [ 100 ] and [ 01 - 1 ] ) of permalloy may be different . </S>",
    "<S> thus , depending on their signs , they can induce either easy or hard magnetization axes along the [ 100 ] or [ 01 - 1 ] directions of the nife microstrips . in our case </S>",
