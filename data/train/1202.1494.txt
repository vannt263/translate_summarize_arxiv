    "we have recently demonstrated a new experimental platform for the simultaneous trapping and optical interfacing of laser - cooled cesium atoms @xcite .",
    "the scheme uses a two - color evanescent field surrounding an optical nanofiber to localize the atoms in a one - dimensional optical lattice about 200  nm above the nanofiber surface @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . at the same time , the atoms can be efficiently interrogated with light which is sent through the nanofiber .",
    "remarkably , an ensemble of 2000 trapped atoms almost entirely absorbs a resonant probe field , yielding an optical depth of up to 32 , equivalent to an absorbance per atom of 1.6  % @xcite .",
    "moreover , when dispersively interfacing the atoms , we observe a phase shift per atom of @xmath0  mrad at a detuning of six times the natural linewidth @xcite .",
    "our technique opens the route towards the direct integration of laser - cooled atomic ensembles within fiber networks , an important prerequisite for large - scale quantum communication .",
    "moreover , our nanofiber trap is ideally suited to the realization of hybrid quantum systems that combine atoms with solid state quantum devices @xcite .    on the route towards the realization of our nanofiber - based atom trap , two important experimental questions had to be addressed :",
    "first , the overall optical potential critically depends on the polarization state of the nanofiber - guided trapping fields @xcite .",
    "however , the nanofiber is realized as the waist of a tapered optical fiber which is non - polarization maintaining for technical reasons . in order to compensate the birefringence of the optical fiber sections which are guiding the trapping light into the nanofiber waist",
    ", we thus had to develop a method for measuring the polarization state of the light field inside the nanofiber itself .",
    "it turns out that this is possible by analyzing the light scattered out of the nanofiber for different input polarizations .",
    "the second experimental challenge was to load laser - cooled atoms into the potential minima .",
    "in general , the most straightforward method for loading atoms into an optical dipole trap is to directly transfer them from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , possibly while further cooling the atoms with an optical molasses  @xcite .",
    "it was , however , far from obvious that this procedure would work for our nanofiber trap since it implied superposing the mot with the nanofiber and required the mot to efficiently cool the atoms at a distance of only @xmath1  nm from the nanofiber surface . in spite of these unknowns ,",
    "the technique turns out to be successful .",
    "in particular , it is possible to prepare nanofiber - trapped ensembles with sub - doppler temperatures .",
    "moreover , the loading process leads to a sub - poissonian distribution of the number of atoms per trapping site due to the so - called collisional blockade effect  @xcite . here , we present the experimental techniques and results related to the characterization of the polarization state of the nanofiber - guided trapping light fields , of the temperature of the nanofiber - trapped atoms , and of the number of atoms per trapping site .",

    "a silica fiber , having a @xmath3{mm}$ ] long tapered region of @xmath4{nm}$ ] diameter , is placed in an ultra - high vacuum chamber at a typical pressure of @xmath5{mbar}$ ] .",
    "to realize the two - color nanofiber dipole trap for cesium atoms , two light fields are launched into the fiber .",
    "one has a free - space wavelength of @xmath6{nm}$ ] and is thus blue - detuned with respect to the cesium d - line transitions , @xmath7{nm}$ ] and @xmath8{nm}$ ] .",
    "the second ( @xmath9{nm}$ ] ) is red - detuned and is sent into the thin fiber from both sides . in the 500-nm diameter region of the fiber , all light fields used in the presented experiment",
    "are guided in the fundamental @xmath10 mode  @xcite .",
    "both trapping light fields are chosen to have quasi - linear polarization where the polarization planes are oriented perpendicular with respect to each other in order to maximize the azimuthal confinement in the trap  @xcite .",
    "the fiber - guided 780-nm mode has a power of @xmath11{mw}$ ] , the respective 1064-nm standing wave field has a power of @xmath12{mw}$ ] . using these parameters , two arrays of potential minima form along the nanofiber .",

    "the constant @xmath17 denotes boltzmann s constant . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "polarization control of the fiber - guided modes is an indispensable requirement in the context of nanofiber - based optical trapping .",
    "the nanofiber is produced from a non - polarization maintaining base fiber for technical reasons .",
    "thus , the birefringence of the optical fiber sections which are guiding the trapping light into the nanofiber waist is a priori unknown .",
    "however , in order to obtain azimuthal confinement of the atoms in the nanofiber dipole trap , a defined quasi - linear polarization of the trapping laser fields is required  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a method for measuring the polarization state of the light field inside the nanofiber itself has to be implemented .    here",
    ", we realize this characterization by analyzing the light scattered out of the nanofiber by surface imperfections and by inhomogeneities in the bulk silica .",
    "we assume that the scatterers are point - like and that they conserve the local polarization and phase of the nanofiber - guided modes .",
    "we therefore further assume that the scattered intensity in a given azimuthal direction is given by the coherent sum of the amplitudes of these local dipole emitters which are randomly distributed over the nanofiber surface and bulk .    the set - up and procedure for measuring and optimizing the polarization state of the nanofiber - guided light",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ]  ( a ) .",
    "the nanofiber axis defines the @xmath18-axis of the coordinate system .",
    "two ccd cameras observe the scattered light along the @xmath19-axis ( camera 1 ) and @xmath20-axis ( camera 2 ) , respectively .",
    "the apertures of the imaging optics are small , thereby ensuring a high angular resolution of about @xmath21 .",
    ", the scattered light will thus also be polarized along @xmath19 and its intensity will obey a dipole emission pattern .",
    "two cameras allow one to image the light scattered into the @xmath19- and @xmath20-direction , respectively .",
    "both cameras can be equipped with a polarization filter .",
    "the orientation of the polarization plane of the fiber - guided mode is given by the angle @xmath22 as indicated . in ( b ) , the optical powers detected by both cameras are shown as a function of @xmath22 for various settings of the polarization filters .",
    "the solid lines are fits taking experimental imperfections into account ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "if the mode was exactly linearly polarized along @xmath19 , the azimuthal dependence of the scattered intensity would , under the above assumptions , be given by a dipole emission pattern , yielding @xmath23 with @xmath22 as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ]  ( a ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) for camera 1 ( 2 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath10 modes have a non - trivial , spatially varying polarization . as a result , due to the two - fold symmetry of the minor component of the transverse polarization  @xcite",
    ", a higher order term @xmath26 $ ] will contribute to the observed intensity .",
    "moreover , they are not transversally polarized but exhibit a significant @xmath18-component . in order to nonetheless be able to adjust the polarization state of the fiber - guided modes , both ccd cameras are equipped with a polarization filter . by these means",
    ", the contribution of the @xmath18-component can be suppressed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ]  ( b ) , the integrated intensity of the ccd signals of cameras 1 and 2 are plotted for various angles @xmath22 .",
    "the latter is adjusted by a half wave retardation plate before coupling the light field into the fiber .",
    "as expected , with the @xmath18-polarization component filtered out , the power on camera 1 ( plotted in black ) varies @xmath27 out of phase with respect to the power on camera 2 ( plotted in green ) .",
    "we optimize the contrast of the signals using a berek polarization compensator before coupling the light field into the fiber . in the optimum case , this yields a contrast of @xmath28  % , most probably limited by non - polarization maintaining scattering .",
    "we checked that the light exiting the tapered optical fiber has a pure polarization state which is stable over many hours .",
    "therefore , we infer that by maximizing @xmath29 , we realize the best possible approximation of a quasi - linearly polarized he@xmath30 mode on the nanofiber waist .",
    "while the above discussion only considered the optimization of the polarization of the red - detuned trapping light field at a wavelength of 1064  nm , it turns out that the single berek compensator suffices to also compensate the birefringence of the fiber for the other two wavelengths at 852  nm and 780  nm . for this purpose ,",
    "the visibility of the rayleigh - scattered pattern for all three wavelengths is maximized iteratively .",
    "when trying to further optimize the individual visibilities for each wavelength by using additional berek compensators in front of non - polarizing beamsplitters , the visibility could not be further increased .",
    "we therefore conclude that , after the optimization procedure , the single berek compensator compensates all parasitic birefringence to zeroth order .",
    "it is instructive to further consider the @xmath22-dependence of the ccd signals when adjusting the polarizers to pass the @xmath18-component .",
    "interestingly , in this case , we also observe a modulation with a contrast of 87  % .",
    "this behavior can be understood when taking into account the spatial dependence of the @xmath18-component of a he@xmath30 mode , quasi - linearly polarized along @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : polvector ] ) . as is apparent from this plot , the @xmath18-component of the e - field changes sign under reflection at the @xmath20-@xmath18-plane . as a consequence ,",
    "when observing the scattered intensity along the @xmath20-direction , full destructive interference takes place . when observing along the @xmath19-direction",
    ", however , there is a non - zero path length difference to the detector between corresponding points which oscillate in phase opposition , thereby turning the destructive interference into partially constructive interference .",
    "finally , when entirely removing the polarization filter of camera 1 , the observed signal ( plotted in blue ) corresponds to the sum of the @xmath20- and @xmath18-signal . in this case , the terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 approximately sum up a constant offset on top of which the effect of the @xmath33 term is clearly apparent .",
    "this nicely illustrates the importance of filtering out the @xmath18-component when optimizing the polarization with our method .",

    "with the trapping laser polarizations optimized as outlined , the nanofiber - based trap is ready to be loaded . for this purpose , a magneto - optical trap ( mot )",
    "is superposed with the nanofiber .",
    "the mot performs normally in spite of the presence of the 500-nm diameter fiber including the trapping fields .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations in @xcite , where sub - doppler temperatures have been measured for a mot cloud of @xmath36rb atoms which was superposed with a bare nanofiber of 700  nm diameter .",
    "both , the mot loading as well as the transfer of the atoms to the nanofiber - based trap is performed like in ref .",
    "@xcite and corresponds to a typical loading sequence of a steep optical dipole trap  @xcite .",
    "the total number of atoms in the trap is determined from an absorption measurement using fiber - guided probe light resonant with the d2 line of cesium . from the total power scattered by the trapped cesium atoms at full saturation",
    ", their number is determined to be around 2000  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the temperature of the trapped atoms is relevant for numerous applications of our nanofiber trap . as an example , the thermal motion , combined with a position - dependent light shift on the atomic transition frequencies , leads to inhomogeneous broadening , thereby limiting the reversible dephasing time of quantum superpositions @xcite .",
    "we will see below that in our case we load at most one atom per trapping site into the nanofiber trap due to the collisional blockade effect @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "a versatile method for measuring the temperature has been presented in refs .",
    "it relies on the adiabatic lowering of the trapping potential and the measurement of the number of remaining trapped atoms as a function of the reduced trap depth . from an initial depth @xmath37 ,",

    "in order to derive the initial temperature of the atoms from the above measurement , the correspondence between @xmath40 and @xmath41 has to be determined . for this purpose ,",
    "a monte - carlo simulation of classical atomic trajectories is performed since no analytical expression is known . starting with different random initial positions in the trap and different random phases of the in - trap oscillation ,",

    "the large trap frequencies realized in the present set - up ( see table  [ tab : trap ] ) , combined with the scattering of near resonant light during transfer of the atoms from the mot to the nanofiber trap , realize a situation in which the collisional blockade effect might occur and lead to a sub - poissonian atom number distribution in each trapping site @xcite .",
    "in particular , over a large range of parameters , the maximum atom number per trapping site can be limited to one while the average occupation is close to 0.5 .",
    "the necessary condition for observing such a collisional blockade is to have the one - body loss rate during the loading process , @xmath75 , much smaller than the light - induced two - body loss rate , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the trapping volume @xcite .",
