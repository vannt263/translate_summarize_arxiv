    "the name _ electron liquid _ or _ electron gas _ refers to a model system formed by interacting dynamical electrons within a medium containing a uniformly distributed positive charge having no motion .",
    "the overall system is electrically neutral .",
    "as the positive background is rigid , it does not respond to any kind of excitation , hence , it can not polarize , however , the electrons can .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron liquid ( el ) has been studied as a model system for metals @xcite and the 3d positive ion liquid was proposed as a model astrophysical system @xcite . in the case of two - dimensions , the study of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) el has been driven mainly by technological advances such as silicon inversion layers @xcite , modulation doped field effect transistors @xcite , intercalated graphite layers @xcite , and fractional quantum hall effect in 2d electron systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to its technological importance the 2d el contains rich physics due to enhanced particle correlations and geometrical parameters that characterize the actual realization of the 2d system .",
    "the el stayed as a problem of interest in the past few decades and intense research efforts lead to several advances in the field .",
    "for the 2d case the first major contribution was due to stern who calculated the density - density response function of the noninteracting el @xcite , which is known in the 3d case as the lindhard function .",
    "the stern function ( i.e. , 2d lindhard function ) immediately made the random phase approximation ( rpa ) available to 2d el .",
    "rpa was at that time one of the most successful many - body approaches for the el . in 1976",
    ", jonson @xcite showed that for 2d el , a many - body approach proposed by singwi and coworkers @xcite ( referred to as stls ) performed remarkably better than rpa .",
    "we have very recently compared the 2d - stls technique with the quantum monte carlo data of tanatar and ceperley @xcite and proposed analytical forms for the dielectric function of the _ ideal _ 2d el based on the stls technique @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the dielectric function and the local - field correction paves the way for a variety of many - body related terms such as self - energy , carrier lifetime , mobility @xcite .",
    "connections to density - functional theory can also be established @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dielectric screening plays a substantial role in the characterization of other excitations , such as , polarons @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to present an accurate and systematic characterization of the dielectric properties of the quasi-2d ( q2d ) el in real heterojunctions where the electron distribution can penetrate to both sides of the interface .",
    "the charge distribution is based on a variational approach proposed by bastard @xcite . the effective 2d electron interaction for this system",
    "is characterized by the coulomb form factor .",
    "this quantity is treated rigorously .",
    "the dielectric function for the gaas / algaas heterojunction is given for wide ranges of electron and ionized acceptor densities . throughout this work the term _ dielectric function _",
    ", refers to the _ longitudinal _ dielectric function .",
    "we also fitted analytical expressions to our data for the efficient use of these results by other researchers . to simplify the computational labour we stayed in the zero - temperature formulation and the so - called electrical quantum limit , where only the lowest subband along the confinement direction is populated ( we refer to a very recent work @xcite , discussing the effects of higher subbands on the dielectric function ) .",

    "the one - dimensional quantum confinement gives the q2d nature to the system and behaves remarkably different than ideal 2d and 3d systems . in handling the many - body effects in heterojunctions",
