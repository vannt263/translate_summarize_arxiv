    "an important discovery at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in recent years is the realization of strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp )  @xcite . for the collective effects from rhic experiments , known as radial and elliptic flow",
    ", the qgp could be well described by ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "it implies that the qgp at rhic is the most perfect fluid  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , shuryak has pointed out there should be lots of bound states  @xcite especially for light and heavy qq bound states at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the transition temperature . for the physical quark mass",
    "the qcd transition is a non - singular crossover at finite temperature . in recent lattice results , at high temperatures and small densities ,",
    "it is a crossover from hadronic phase to qgp phase  @xcite . from recent theoretical studies",
    ", we have realized the rich phases of qcd theory , such as color superconducting phase  @xcite , pion condensation  @xcite , color glass condensate and quarkyonic phase  @xcite .",
    "now the rhic results tell us that after deconfinement , the quarks are not free immediately , as we usually thought for a weakly coupled qgp ( wqgp ) , but still in strong coupled state which leads to a new state of nuclear matter as the sqgp . how to understand the formation mechanism of sqgp is an important problem  @xcite . as we know",
    ", there are confine potential and color coulomb potential between quarks in vacuum , know as @xmath2 . with temperature @xmath3",
    "increased to some critical temperature , the confine potential disappears , while the coulomb potential remains , which could still be very strong  @xcite .",
    "thus in literatures , the effective coulomb potential has been often used to describe the strong interaction of sqgp  @xcite .",
    "but from the theoretical point of view , it is lack of a more fundamental theoretical model to understand these bound states of quarks . in this paper",
    "we wish to use non - topological fl model to study this problem .",
    "fl model has been widely discussed in past decays  @xcite .",
    "it has been very successful in describing phenomenologically the static properties of hadrons and their behaviors at low energy .",
    "the model consists of quark fields interacting with a phenomenological scalar field @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 field is introduced to describe the complicated nonperturbative features of qcd vacuum .",
    "it naturally gives a color confinement mechanism in qcd theory .",
    "the model has been also extended to finite temperatures and densities to study deconfinement phase transition  @xcite .",
    "however it seems that the deep meaning of the soliton solutions in deconfinement phase transition has not been revealed in the past studies .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study in detail the properties of the solitons in fl model before and after deconfinement , and provide a natural explanation and description of sqgp through this effective theoretical model .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we give a brief introduction of fl model .",
    "the field equations and the effective potential are derived . in section 3 , the soliton equation of fl model",
    "is solved for different boundary conditions and the physical meanings of these solitons in deconfinement are thoroughly discussed . in section 4 , a phase diagram of deconfinement phase transition is given .",
    "the last section is the summary .",
    "we start from the lagrangian of the fl model , = |(i_^-g)+12(_)(^)-u ( ) , whereu()=12!a^2 + 13!b^3 + 14!c^4+b .",
    "@xmath5 represents the quark field , and @xmath4 denotes the phenomenological scalar field . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the constants which are generally fitted in with producing the properties of hadrons appropriately .    for the thermal equilibrium system , the @xmath4 field will be replaced by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the gibbs thermal average of the @xmath4 field , and @xmath10 is the fluctuation . at mean field approximation , one can obtain the field equations as follows , & & ( i_^-g|)=0 , + & & _ ^|=- , [ mean ] where @xmath11 is one loop effective potential at finite temperature and density .",
    "notice that at mean field approximation the quantum corrections have been neglected .",
    "the @xmath11 could be derived through finite temperature field theory  @xcite , v_eff = u(|)+1(1-e^-e_)- , [ eff ] in which @xmath12 is the inverse temperature , @xmath13 is the chemical potential , and @xmath14 is a degenerate factor , @xmath15 . besides @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the effective masses of the quark and @xmath4 field respectively .    from equation ( [ mean ] )",
    ", one could see that the properties of the soliton field @xmath9 depend completely on the effective potential @xmath11 .",
    "as known , by the effective potential at finite temperature and density , one can study the deconfinement phase transition in fl model .",
    "thus the properties of solitons in deconfinement , especially the relations between solitons and deconfinement , could be well studied through solving the equation ( [ mean ] ) at finite temperature and density .    in our calculation , the parameters are chosen to be @xmath20 .",
    "the effective mass of @xmath4 field is fixed at @xmath21  @xcite . at zero temperature and density",
    ", the @xmath11 is just the @xmath22 and could be plotted in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "there are two minima : one corresponds to the perturbative vacuum at @xmath23 , another corresponds to the physical vacuum at @xmath24 .",
    "for the static and spherically symmetric soliton field , the equation ( [ mean ] ) becomes + 2r=. [ soliton ] we will solve this equation numerically . a standard numerical package colsys will be used for the numerical calculation  @xcite .    for solving the soliton equation ( [ soliton ] ) , one should first determine the boundary condition .",
    "there are two different cases of the boundary conditions for solving the equation  @xcite . in the following",
    "the two cases will be studied separately .      in this case",
    ", we may consider the mechanical analog in which there is a point particle at  positon \" @xmath4 and a time ",
    "r \" , moving in a  potential \" @xmath25 .",
    "the discussions about this mechanical analog could be found in ref .",
    "equation ( [ soliton ] ) is then the movement equation of the particle . because the energy conservation will be applied in this case , the second term at l.h.s of equation ( [ soliton ] ) will be omitted .",
    "thus the equation becomes = .",
    "[ soliton1 ] in order to determine the boundary condition , suppose at  time \" @xmath26 , the  position \" of the particle is at @xmath23 . from fig.[f1 ] , if the particle is pushed very gently to start moving , the particle will move to another point just at @xmath27 where @xmath28 , noticing that the particle is moving in the  potential \" @xmath25 .",
    "because of energy conservation , the particle will then move back and return to the point @xmath23 .",
    "thus one could obtain the following boundary condition , |(r=-)=0 ,  |(r=+)=0 . from fig.[f1 ] , the physical vacuum @xmath24 is stable , and @xmath29 is the bag constant .",
