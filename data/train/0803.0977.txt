    "the classical problem of modelling the mass distribution and the corresponding gravitational potential of our galaxy carries with it the key to our understanding of the elusive dark matter .",
    "nowadays , the dominant paradigm is that dark matter is actually made of non - baryonic weakly interacting massive particles , the so - called cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "many models of the milky way have been devised in this context ( e.g. , wilkinson & evans 1999 , olling & merrifield 2001 , klypin , zhao & somerville 2002 ) .",
    "however , a modification of the newtonian dynamics ( mond ) has been suggested as an alternative to those cdm models . in mond",
    "the newtonian gravitational acceleration @xmath1 is replaced with @xmath2 when the gravitational acceleration is far smaller than the acceleration constant @xmath3 , ( e.g. , milgrom 1983a , b , c ; bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ; sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ; bekenstein 2006 ; milgrom 2008 ; zhao 2008 ) .",
    "mond tightly fits the observations without dark matter in different types of galaxies ( e.g. , milgrom & sanders 2003 ; sanders & noordermeer 2007 ; nipoti et al .",
    "2007 ; famaey et al . 2007a ; gentile et al 2007a , b ; tiret et al . 2007 ;",
    "sanchez - salcedo et al .",
    "moreover , the research on covariant mond theories ( e.g. , bekenstein 2004 ; sanders 2005 ; bruneton & esposito - farse 2007 ; zhao 2007 ) now enables the study of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. , skordis et al .",
    "2006 ) , the growth of structure ( e.g. , halle et al .",
    "2007 ; skordis 2008 ) , and gravitational lensing of galaxies ( e.g. , zhao et al 2006 ; chen & zhao 2006 ) and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , angus et al .",
    "2007 ; famaey et al .",
    "2007b ; milgrom & sanders 2007 ) .    the cdm and mond interpretation of galaxy kinematics can sometimes be viewed as degenerate , at the price of accepting some mysterious conspiracy between the distribution of baryons and dark matter at all radii in the cdm context ( see e.g. mcgaugh 2005 ) .",
    "there are , however , some fundamental differences : one of them is the role of dynamical friction ( e.g. , sanchez - salcedo et al .",
    "2006 ; nipoti et al .",
    "another one is the fact that the strong equivalence principle is violated in mond when considering the external field in which a system is embedded ( e.g. , bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ; zhao & tian 2006 ; famaey , bruneton & zhao 2007c ; sanchez - salcedo & hernandez 2007 ) .",
    "hence , it is also important to study the effects of the environment in mond : unlike in cdm , the rotation curves and the morphology of galaxies depend on both the background and self - gravity acceleration ( wu et al .",
    "the escape velocity at any location in a galaxy is also dependent on this external field ( famaey et al .",
    "2007c ; wu et al .",
    "it is however virtually impossible to precisely calculate the value of the external field at the location of the milky way without describing the local group formation in the context of a mond n - body simulation .",
    "nevertheless , one can estimate its order of magnitude from the acceleration endured during a hubble time in order to attain a peculiar velocity of 600  @xmath4 with respect to the cmb , @xmath5 .",
    "this value is also _ roughly _ the one produced by the m31 galaxy , as well as the one produced by the virgo and coma clusters ( famaey et al .",
    "2007c ) .    in this paper , we model the milky way with different cdm - based models , and compare them with the mond framework , allowing for various values of the external field .",
    "we show that while the cdm models have a spherical potential in the outer regions of the galaxy ( @xmath6  kpc ) , the mond potential is more ellipsoidal .",
    "we then also numerically calculate the circular and escape velocities from the galaxy as a function of position in both mond and cdm models , and finally apply this to the case of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in order to see which models allow it to be bound to the milky way .",
    "we conclude that , in mond , an external field of less than @xmath7 is needed , an upper limit strikingly similar to that needed to explain the local escape speed from the solar neighbourhood ( famaey et al .",
    "2007c ; wu et al .",
    "there now exists several covariant frameworks for mond ( see , e.g. , bekenstein 2004 ; sanders 2005 ; bruneton & esposito - farse 2007 ; skordis 2008 , halle et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) . in the quasi - static and weak field limit of these theories , the slightly bent metric for a galaxy",
    "is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the euclidean distance in cartesian coordinates , and the newtonian gauge is adopted with the potential being @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    as one of the simplest frameworks , one can adopt the @xmath12 co - variant formulation of zhao ( 2007 ) , and halle et al .",
    "the @xmath12 model works as gr , except that the space - time is filled with a * n*on-*u*niform dark energy fluid described by a four - vector @xmath13 , with unit norm and parallel to the local time direction .",
    "if we define a dimensionless co - variant vector e^ & & ~(0 , -_x a_0 , -_y a_0 , -_z a_0 )  , where @xmath14 is the four - vector s covariant derivative projected along the local time direction , we can consider the model with a vector field lagrangian density given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a dimensionless funtion of @xmath17 .",
    "we then minimize against the total action which contains this @xmath12 fluid action plus the the usual einstein - hilbert action and the usual matter action .",
    "the equation of motion of the vector field then sets the vector field to be @xmath18 in the weak - field quasi - static limit , while the ij - cross - term of the einstein equation requires the newtonian potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 to be equal in the absence of anisotropic stress . the tt - term and the ii - terms of the einstein equations",
    "can thus be combined to yield : @xmath21 - q/2 = 4 \\pi g \\left(\\rho + \\frac{p}{c^2 } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a function of @xmath23 and of scalar mode perturbations of the four - vector @xmath13 , and is negligible near collapsed quasi - static systems , like the pressure term is .",
    "the function @xmath24 is a dielectric - like scalar free function of the covariant scalar quantity @xmath25 .",
    "this dielectric - like function is thus the equivalent of the @xmath26-function of mond ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) . to recover the mond phenomenology ,",
    "a specific choice of the function can be  = ( 1 + |e| n)^-n .",
    "zhao ( 2007 ) prefers the parameter @xmath27 to best explain the amplitude of the cosmological constant . here",
    "we rather choose @xmath28 corresponding to the ` simple ' @xmath26-function of mond ( famaey & binney 2005 ; zhao & famaey 2006 ; famaey et al .",
    "2007a ; sanders & noordermeer 2007 ) .",
    "note finally that , when a galaxy is embedded in an external field @xmath29 , we have that the _ total _ gravitational force @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the internal potential of the galaxy .",
    "we model the milky way in mond following wu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , where the besanon baryons model ( robin et al . 2003 ) is used .",
    "this model contains a thin stellar disc with mass of @xmath32 , a thick stellar disc of @xmath33 , a bar / bulge of @xmath34 , an interstellar gaseous matter component of @xmath35 , and a stellar halo of @xmath36 .",
    "we first choose an external field @xmath37 : this is presumably due to the local gravitational attraction of large scale structure , and mainly from the so - called great attractor region ( see radburn - smith et al .",
    "2006 ) in the sun - galactic centre direction .",
    "we then let the external field vary , in order to investigate the effect of its value on the mond model .",
    "indeed , the effect of m31 , and of the coma and virgo clusters , makes the value of the external field extremely uncertain .",
    "for instance , the baryonic mass of m31 is estimated to lie between @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( seigar et al . 2006 ; tempel et al .",
    "2007 ; geehan et al . 2006 ; carignan et al . 2006 ) , and sits at 800  kpc from the milky way center , thus exerting an external field in the range @xmath40 , a value roughly similar to the one exerted by large scale structure .",
    "note however that the external field from m31 is a varying one , and that if one _ only _ considered the external field from m31 , no star could ever escape from the mw - m31 system because the external field from m31 would _ never _ dominate over the internal one from the mw in the direction opposite to m31 .",
    "a star from the solar neighbourhood leaving in this direction would thus never escape : this is why the external field from large scale structure is also important . in any case",
    ", we consider hereafter the external field as a parameter that can be constrained by data ( such as the proper motion of the lmc , see sect .",
    "once the external field is chosen , we solve for the internal gravitational acceleration , @xmath41 , the modified poisson equation of mond ( see also eq .",
    "3 ) -=4g , x=|*g*_ext - _ int| a_0 with the boundary condition - _ int - _ int^(x,y,z ) on all the most external grid points ( labelled @xmath42 here ) , and _",
    "int^=-gm(g_ext / a_0 ) , where @xmath43 is a dilation factor in the range [ 0,1 ] ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ; milgrom 1986a ; zhao & tian 2006 ; zhao & famaey 2006 ) , and @xmath44 is a softening factor comparable to the half - light radius of the galaxy .    as stated hereabove",
    ", we choose the ` simple ' @xmath26-function of the form @xmath45 ( famaey & binney 2005 ; zhao & famaey 2006 ; famaey et al .",
    "2007a ; sanders & noordermeer 2007 ) , corresponding to @xmath28 in eq .",
    "we use the poisson solver developed by the bologna group ( ciotti et al .",
    "2006 ) with @xmath46 grid points , the radial grid points being @xmath47 $ ]  kpc .",
    "notice that , even though it has less degrees of freedom than the cdm models presented hereafter , the mond model has , contrary to common wisdom , some freedom : the choice of the @xmath26-function could have been different , the value of @xmath48 has an error bar that we ignored here , the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar component can vary , the presence of unseen baryons can have a big influence ( see sect .",
    "5.4 ) , and the value of the external field is not known a priori .",
    "we note that , in such a mond model , the escape velocity @xmath49 of a test particle at an arbitrary position @xmath50 can be defined as + _ int(x , y , z)e_eff=0.this means that for a zero effective internal energy of the particle ( @xmath51 ) , it can escape from the internal system and never return .",
    "we now compare the mond model described above with various cdm models of the galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , cdm - based models are far from unique .",
    "nevertheless , we limit ourselves to four models : two based on the work of klypin , zhao & somerville ( 2002 , hereafter kzs ) , and two based on the recent work of the rave collaboration on the local escape speed from the solar neighbourhood ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "first we explore the model labelled b1 in kzs , composed of a double - exponential disc for the baryons and a nfw profile ( navarro et al . 1997 ) for the dark matter halo .",
    "we then explore another model in which we replace the kzs baryons with the besanon model , but use the same cdm component as in kzs b1 .",
    "we call this second model the bsc cdm model .",
    "the nfw profile is the most widely used cdm - halo model , it is described as ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) & _ halo(r ) & = _ s x(1+x)^2 , x = r / r_s , + & m_vir&=43_cr_0_thr_s^3c^3 , + & _ s&=_cr_0_th3c^3(1+c)-c(1+c ) . where @xmath52 is the characteristic density parameter",
    ", @xmath53 is the radius parameter , @xmath54 is the critical density of the universe determined by the hubble constant at redshift @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the fraction of matter ( including baryons and dark matter ) to the critical density , @xmath57 is the critical overdensity of the virialized system , and @xmath58 is the concentration parameter . in the inner part of the dark halo , @xmath59 and in the outer part @xmath60 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first panel of fig  [ kzsbsc ] shows the circular and escape velocity curves ( on a logarithmic scale ) of the kzs b1 model compared with the mond ( low external field ) model .",
    "this logarithmic abscissa allows us to have a clearer view of the large - scale behavior of the circular and escape velocity curves . for the cdm model to be consistent with the observed circular velocities and rave - inferred escape velocity ,",
    "the escape velocity at the position of the lmc must be smaller than ( or equal to ) the newly measured mean - value of the 3d velocity .",
    "besla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have shown that an escape velocity of @xmath61 at 50  kpc could still be consistent with the rotation curve of the inner galaxy , if the virial mass within 200  kpc is increased to @xmath62 and the concentration is decreased to @xmath63 .",
    "however , this model is in direct contradiction with the local escape velocity from the solar neighbourhood measured by smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . as for the kzs b1 in which the cdm halo could still bind the lmc ,",
    "such a case is marginal and the lmc is only weakly bound .",
    "in contrast , the mond potential with an external field of @xmath64 is significantly deeper .",
    "therefore , the lmc is undoubtedly captured by the galaxy in this mond potential .",
    "the escape velocity as a function of radius ( on a logarithmic scale ) for the bsc model is shown in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ kzsbsc ] .",
    "again , the lmc speed is in the critical escape velocity range in the nfw cdm framework . on the two panels of fig .",
    "[ kzsbsc ] , the cdm escape velocities are nearly the same , especially at large radii , due to the fact that they have the same cdm halo profile . the baryons affect the rotation curve in the central regions , but have little contribution to the escape velocity in the cdm framework .",
    "finally , we compare the escape velocity in the two rave models with the mond ( low - external field ) model in fig .",
    "the problem of binding the lmc to the galaxy is even more severe in this case ; the nfw halo can not bind the lmc anymore .",
    "the rave  3 model also overestimates the circular velocity because the central region of the wilkinson - evans profile is much too dense .",
    "however , even in this rave  3 model , the escape velocity at the lmc position is predicted to be similar to the actual velocity of the lmc , which means that the lmc is only bound at the one - sigma level .    if more precise measurements of the 3d velocity of the lmc in the future imply that the lmc is truly unbound to the galaxy in the cdm models , it could be a serious problem ( i ) to explain why the orbital angular momentum of the lmc is pointing 9 degrees away or closer to the mean direction of the orbital poles of the ancient satellites ursa minor , fornax , draco , and carina ( metz et al .  2008 ) , and ( ii ) to explain the formation of the magellanic stream by tidal stripping or ram pressure stripping . as already advocated by besla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the lmc would be on a parabolic orbit and would not have suffered any pericentric passage or crossed the disk before . in mond with a low external field",
    "the lmc could then still be on a bound orbit , but the problem might be that this orbit would have a very long period ( approximately 3  gyr ) , and might not cross the disk often enough",
    ". however , the effect of the external field of the galaxy on the self - gravity of the lmc might make it easier for ram pressure stripping to take place .",
    "a detailed study of the orbit and evolution of the internal structure of the lmc in mond is however beyond the scope of this paper , and will be the subject of further studies",
    ".      measurements of the lmc velocity thus provide a unique quantitative observational tool for studying the galactic potential at large distances .",
    "however , an additional observational measure , which is independent of the lmc velocity , may become accessible in the near future through the observations of hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) .",
    "in recent years several hvss have been observed at large distances in the galactic halo ( up to  100 kpc ; brown et al .",
    "these stars have ( most likely ) been ejected from the galactic centre with high velocities , probably following binary disruption by the massive black hole in the galactic centre ( hills 1988 ; yu & tremaine 2003 ; perets 2007 ; perets et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some of these hvss have velocities extending much beyond the escape velocity from the galaxy , where others are still bound to the galaxy ( brown et al .",
    "recently gnedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and yu & madau ( 2007 ) suggested to use the kinematics of hvss in order to probe the galactic potential using the position and velocity vectors of hvss at large galactocentric distances . under the assumption that hvss were ejected from the galactic centre they suggest to measure the departure from purely radial orbits of these hvss , due to the ( possible ) triaxiality of the galactic potential",
    "the slight perturbations from radial orbits are then used in order to estimate the level of triaxiality of the galaxy .",
    "both gnedin et al . and yu & madau have focused on measuring the triaxiality of the galactic potential in the context of cdm models .",
    "however , given the large deviation of mond potentials from spherical symmetry ( relative to cdm potentials ) , these methods could be even more useful for exluding or confirming mond models for the galaxy .",
    "in addition , studies of propagation times and especially the return times of bound hypervelocity stars ( perets et al .",
    "2008 in preparation ) could be highly valuable in constraining mond potentials such as discussed here up to very large distances ( @xmath65100 kpc ) .",
    "more measurements of hvss velocities , especially at large galactocentric distances are expected to be obtained in the few coming years , and could much better constrain our knowledge on the galactic potential .      for completeness",
    "we explore the sensitivity of our predictions to the possibility of a small amount of uncooled , moderately hot baryons existing at large radii in the galaxy .",
    "for this purpose , we added to the besanon ( cool ) baryons model a plummer sphere of @xmath66 with a plummer scale - length of 100  kpc .",
    "in cdm models , this does not affect the prediction since the potential is completely dominated by the cdm halo . in mond , however , the prediction becomes quite different .",
    "the rotation curve remains almost unchanged in both the @xmath64 and @xmath7 external field cases , but the escape velocity is boosted by about 30  km / s at the sun s position . in that case , the @xmath64 external field model is only marginally compatible with the rave - measured local escape velocity , while the @xmath7 model becomes more comparable to the original @xmath64 model , and stronly binds the lmc while still being compatible with the local escape velocity ( see fig .",
    "this again demonstrates that mond models are not as unique as commonly assumed",
    ".    0.5 cm",
    "in this paper , we modelled the milky way with several different cdm - based models , and compared them with the mond framework .",
    "we first showed that the isopotentials are more spherical in cdm , at small radii because the baryonic matter does not affect the potential as much as in mond , and at large radii because the external field flattens the potential in mond . in cdm",
    ", the halo dominates the shape of the potential at large radii , and consequently the escape velocity at different positions on a given spherical shell show only negligible differences .",
    "note that all of our studied cdm halos were spherical , while recent studies on cdm found that the density profiles of massive halos should rather be triaxial ( jing & suto 2002 ; bailin & steinmetz 2005 ; allgood et al .",
    "2006 ; andrea et al .",
    "a mean axis ratio @xmath67 is defined , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the major , intermediate and minor axis . in andrea",
    "et al . ( 2007 ) , for a milky way - like dark halo with a virial mass of @xmath71 , one has @xmath72 .",
    "such triaxial dark halos would change the potential contours inside the virial radius : the potentials would be flattened as well . nevertheless ,",
    "when the radius is far larger than the virial radius ( e.g. 10 times the virial radius ) , the potential contours would become spherical again .",
    "we also showed that the effective , phantom dark matter densities predicted by mond can be negative at large radii ( where the internal and external acceleration are of the same order of magnitude ) , in a cone perpendicular to the external field ( see also milgrom 1986b ) .",
    "a negative convergence parameter could thus in principle be observed in the gravitational lensing generated by milky way - like galaxies , although it would be very sensitive to the detailed non - constant gravitational field of the environment .",
    "in addition , we found the circular and escape velocity as a function of position in the different models .",
    "we showed that the rotation curves in all models are compatible with the inner rotation curve ( clemens 1985 ) as well as with the sdss - measured rotation curve at large radii ( xue et al .",
    "this is true for various @xmath26-functions in mond (  standard \" and  simple \" ) , but the form adopted here fits best the rotation curve ( the  simple \" form of famaey & binney 2005 ) . on the other hand , the prediction of escape velocity as a function of position will be very useful for comparison with inferred velocities from the data of planned or already - underway surveys such as rave , sdss , segue , sim or gaia or the hypervelocity stars survey .",
    "we stress that mond models are far from unique , and that the freedom allowed for the modulus of the external field makes the mond models actually more flexible than cdm - based ones with respect to the escape velocities that could be derived from the kinematic surveys .",
    "high escape velocities would rule out the four cdm models studied here , while any escape velocity between the two curves plotted on fig .",
    "4 would only represent a constraint on the external field in which the milky way is embedded in mond .",
    "we also note that the mond model with an external field of @xmath7 mimicks the cdm ones in terms of both circular and escape velocity curves .",
    "let us finally point out that we did not take into account any effect of the cosmic acceleration in either the cdm or mond context , which could have some effect on both predicted escape speed curves .",
    "we then note that the newly - measured value of the 3d velocity of the lmc ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "2006a , b ; besla et al .",
    "2007 ) could already be an indication that escape velocities in the outer galaxy could actually be higher than that predicted by the cdm models ( as well as by an external field of @xmath7 in mond ) , under the assumption that the lmc is bound to the milky way . more precise measurements of the 3d velocity of the lmc will be needed to disentangle this issue , but with its present value we found that the lmc is only bound at the one - sigma level in three of our four cdm models ( and unbound at the one - sigma level in the fourth one ) . in this context",
    ", we note that the reanalysis of the lmc proper motion by piatek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) yields a smaller value of @xmath73 ( radial and tangential velocities then being @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , which is consistent with the lower error bound of kallivayalil et al .",
    "( 2006a ) . in the mond context",
    ", the measured velocity of the lmc can be used as a constraint on the modulus of the external field in order to keep it bound : we found that an external field of less than @xmath7 is needed , an upper limit strikingly similar to that needed to explain the local escape speed from the solar neighbourhood ( famaey et al .",
    "2007c ; wu et al .",
    "we also suggest that future observations of hypervelocity stars could add additional independent constraints that could even better constrain the models studied here .",
    "it is finally important to note that because of their cuspiness , it will always be difficult for the four cdm models explored in this paper to reproduce the non - axisymmetric motions of gas in the longitude - velocity diagrams of the baryon - dominated inner milky way , as extensively discussed in famaey & binney  ( 2005 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen what the prediction of a mond model is for these non - axisymmetric gas motions .",
    "still , since we showed that the mond potential ( and phantom dark matter ) tracks the baryonic distribution quite well at small radii , and since the best fit to these non - axisymmetric motions of the gas produced by the bar was obtained with a purely baryonic model ( bissantz et al .",
    "2003 ) , it is likely that they could be explained within the mond context .    we thus conclude that the mond model studied in this paper , with an external field of modulus @xmath76 directed in the sun - galactic centre direction , fits all the present observations of the milky way extremely well . if a component of unseen , moderately hot , baryons is added , the preferred value of the external field however becomes higher ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "<S> we compute the milky way potential in different cold dark matter ( cdm ) based models , and compare these with the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) framework . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the axis ratio of the potential in various models , and find that isopotentials are less spherical in mond than in cdm potentials . as an application of these models , we predict the escape velocity as a function of the position in the galaxy </S>",
    "<S> . this could be useful in comparing with future data from planned or already - underway kinematic surveys ( rave , sdss , segue , sim , gaia or the hypervelocity stars survey ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the predicted escape velocity is compared with the recently measured high proper motion velocity of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . to bind the lmc to the galaxy in a mond model , while still being compatible with the rave - measured local escape speed at the sun s position </S>",
    "<S> , we show that an external field modulus of less than @xmath0 is needed .    </S>",
