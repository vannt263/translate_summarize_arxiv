    "the physics program of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has produced many intriguing results and posed a number of unexplained problems .",
    "one central question that has emerges is : how can hydrodynamical behaviour , implying local thermal equilibration and complete decoherence of the initial state , occur on a time scale which is considerably shorter than 1 fm/@xmath4 ?",
    "@xcite .    in an earlier article @xcite",
    "we showed that the entropy per rapidity interval produced by decoherence alone is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the nuclear radius and @xmath3 is the gluon saturation scale @xcite .",
    "the resulting entropy per unit rapidity interval is of the order @xmath7 , which amount to a substantial fraction of the total produced entropy .",
    "we than argued that the decoherence time has to be of order @xmath2 , as this is the natural scale of the process .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to substantiate this claim by means of a quantitative calculation .",
    "the fact that entropy produced by decoherence can play an important role in high - energy heavy - ion collisions was to the best of our knowledge first discussed in @xcite .",
    "our article is organized as follows : in section ii we explain how we attack the problem and how we define the decoherence time . in section iii",
    "we describe the calculation of the density matrix for gluons , which undergo a hard scattering process , in detail .",
    "our calculation is based on work by kovchegov and mueller @xcite on gluon production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we generalize their derivation of probabilities to the level of density matrices . in section",
    "iv we calculate the decoherence time using the results from section iii .",
    "our goal is to obtain an estimate of the decoherence time of the gluon distribution in a large nucleus ( 1 ) , when it is hit by another very energetic large nucleus ( 2 ) . in principle , the decoherence process is encoded in the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath8 in a very simple manner : for vanishing off - diagonal matrix elements the system is completely decoherent . in our case",
    "the dominant degrees of freedom are the gluons and thus the relevant density matrix is that of the gluons in nucleus 1 .",
    "decoherence thus manifests itself in a gradual disappearance of its off - diagonal elements @xmath9 with the momenta @xmath10 .",
    "this sounds simple enough , but actually calculating the time evolution of off - diagonal elements in a complex multi - particle state is an extremely difficult task @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has studied so far mainly very simple toy models , like one harmonic oscillator in a termal bath of other harmonic oscillators , or rather specific situations , like neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "luckily , also the situation encountered in high energy heavy ion collisions is such a special case , for the following two reasons : + i ) all gluons which undergo scattering are boosted into a part of phase space which was originally empty .",
    "+ ii ) the description simplifies strongly in the rest system of one of the colliding nuclei . for an arbitrary lorentz frame",
    "we do not know how to model the degree of coherence before the collision in both nuclei . in the rest frame of one of the nuclei , however , both nuclei can be approximated by different asymptotic descriptions . for a very fast moving nucleus one",
    "observes saturation and can describe the gluon field correlations along the lines of @xcite , while for the nucleus at rest we can assume a simple _ isotropic _ gaussian correlation of gluons with a typical virtuality of order @xmath11 .",
    "the precise form of this correlation does not really matter , because we will only study the correlations in that part of phase space mentionned in i ) , which is originally empty .",
    "+ therefore , the elementary process of hard gluon scattering is sufficent to estimate the decoherence time . + we perform our calculation in the rest frame of nucleus 1 , which is hit by the highly lorentz contracted nucleus 2 , which is moving to the left . at lowest order in the strong coupling @xmath12 the time evolution of the gluon density matrix is governed by the reaction @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes a component of the gluon wave function of nucleus @xmath15 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we investigate the gluon density matrix @xmath16 in a plane wave basis . because the ground state wave function of nucleus 1 is a fully coherent bound state , the initial density matrix @xmath17 is strongly non - diagonal in this basis . as usual for a fast moving projectile , it is convenient to use light - cone coordinates @xmath18 with @xmath19 . since , in our convention , nucleus 2 moves to the left , @xmath20 is large and the nucleus remains localized in @xmath21 , which thus denotes the light - cone position of nucleus 2 . on the other hand , @xmath22 takes on the role of the `` light - cone time '' , by which the progress of the collision is monitored .",
    "this is also the starting idea of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach @xcite , which is based on the assumption that most of the gluons in nucleus 2 hardly evolve on the time scale of the collision , endowing the gluon distribution with a `` glassy '' nature .",
    "the `` time '' evolution of @xmath8 due to the three - gluon interaction is then given by @xmath23 \\frac{dx_+}{\\sqrt{2 } }      - [ \\hat h_{\\rm int},[\\hat h_{\\rm int},\\hat d(0)]]\\frac{(dx_+)^2}{4 }       + \\ldots \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24    for what follows , the variable @xmath25 stands for the multiple quantum numbers completely specifying a gluonic state in nucleus 1 : @xmath26 , with wave vector @xmath27 , polarization vector @xmath28 , and color index @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath33 is some appropriate @xmath34 normalization volume , which we will specify later .",
    "@xmath35 describes the interaction with the incident gluons contained in nucleus 2 , which moves very close to the speed of light .",
    "since these gluons originate in many different nucleons , it is a good approximation to consider them as uncorrelated and to describe them as a gaussian random ensemble @xcite representing an incident stream of weizscker - williams ( ww ) gluons , all of which have positive @xmath36 momentum .",
    "the gluon fields of nucleus 1 will be characterized by a gaussian ensemble of off - shell gluon fields with a spatial coherence length @xmath37 of the order of the confinement scale @xmath38 : @xmath39/\\lambda^2 \\right\\ }   .",
    "\\label{eq4a}\\ ] ] we emphasize that we do not assume the gluon field in any nucleus to be dilute .",
    "we only assume that the typical momentum transfere @xmath40 is sufficiently large so that we can treat the interaction perturbatively in the coupling constant @xmath41 .",
    "the ww gluon fields are given in @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 13 ) . for our calculation",
    "it is crucially important that the color charge densities @xmath42 and path ordered factors @xmath43 are uncorrelated for different values of @xmath44 : @xmath45 this and eq .",

    "let us stress again that the asymptotic descriptions ( [ eq4a ] ) and eq .",
    "( 48 ) of @xcite treat the two nuclei in asymmetrically .",
    "therefore , one can not expect the final expressions to be manifestly boost invariant .",
    "our calculation of the decoherence is specific to our selected lorentz frame .",
    "while a manifestly boost invariant treatment of the decoherence process would be desirable , such a treatment would have to rely on a lorentz covariant representation of the nuclear ground state .",
    "we do not address this interesting problem here .    because the incident nucleus 2 is a color singlet , its glue field vanishes on average : @xmath46 .",
    "this implies the absence of a contribution to the time evolution of the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath8 in first order in @xmath47 .",
    "the first nonvanishing term is thus of order @xmath48 , corresponding to the term proportional to @xmath49 in ( [ eq1 ] ) , which is of second order in the ww fields of nucleus 2 .",
    "the leading term for the evolution of the density matrix arises from the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51    our aim is to calculate the density matrix in the region of phase space populated by the outgoing gluons ( momentum @xmath52 ) .",
    "this density matrix contains all the crucial information :    * the ratio @xmath53 is a measure for the coherence . for a pure state",
    "it is one , for a completely decoherent state it is much smaller than one , of the order of @xmath54 for a region of phase space with @xmath55 states .",
    "we shall show that in the transverse directions ( i.e. except for @xmath56 ) we get nearly complete decoherence .",
    "we will also see that this ratio depends on the observation time and we shall define as decoherence time @xmath57 as the time after which it reaches @xmath58 . * the entropy of the final state can be calculated from @xmath59 we argued in @xcite that this is a sizeable fraction of the total entropy produced in a heavy ion collision",
    ". it should be possible to evaluate eq.([entropy ] ) for the density matrix we obtain , but the calculation is highly non - trivial .",
    "therefore , we leave this task for a future publication . having a model for the density matrix in hand it should actually also be possible to calculate other quantities specifying the initial state for the time evolution of the high - temperature phase produced in such collisions .",
