    "central stars of planetary nebulae ( pns ) are expected to emit soft x - rays if their effective temperatures are greater than 100,000 k. indeed , such x - ray sources have been detected by _",
    "einstein _ , _ exosat _ , and _ rosat _ , and the x - ray photons detected have energies well below 0.5 kev @xcite .",
    "in addition to the soft x - ray emission from the photosphere , _ rosat _ observations of the central stars of lotr5 and ngc7293 ( also known as the helix nebula ) show a harder x - ray component peaking between 0.5 and 1.0 kev @xcite .",
    "the central star of lotr5 is a known binary @xcite , and the coronal activity of its g5  iii companion may be responsible for the hard x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the central star of ngc7293 , on the other hand , is not a known binary @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the hard x - ray emission from ngc7293 originates from the interaction between the fast stellar wind and the ambient nebular material @xcite .",
    "if this is true , the x - ray emission from ngc7293 should be spatially extended , similar to that observed in ngc6543 @xcite .",
    "we have obtained _ chandra _ observations of ngc7293 and find that this source remains unresolved by _",
    "chandra _ s high resolution .",
    "we have also obtained _ chandra _ observations of ngc6543 ( the cat s eye nebula ) and find that its central star emits x - rays , too @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this source peaks at @xmath4 0.5 kev ; thus , ngc6543 joins ngc7293 as hosts of enigmatic point x - ray sources .",
    "this paper reports our _ chandra _ observations of the point sources in ngc6543 and ngc7293 .",
    "the observations are described in  2 , the properties of the x - ray emission are presented in  3 , the  possible origins of these x - ray sources are discussed in  4 , and the conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "ngc6543 and ngc7293 were observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board",
    "_ chandra x - ray observatory _ on 2000 may 1011 and 1999 november 1718 for total exposure times of 46.0 and 47.7 ks , respectively .",
    "the nebular centers were placed on the back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd chip s3 , the nominal aim point for the acis - s array .",
    "the instrumental fwhm of the acis observations is 0708 at @xmath5 1 kev @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution , @xmath6 , is @xmath7 at 0.5 kev and @xmath8 at 1.0 kev .",
    "we received level 1 and level 2 processed data from the _ chandra _ data center .",
    "the data reduction and analysis were performed using the _ chandra _ x - ray center software ciao v1.1.5 and heasarc ftools and xspec v11.0.1 routines @xcite .",
    "no background  flares \" affected the observations and no time intervals needed to be removed .",
    "the @xmath9 observations of ngc6543 detected 1,950@xmath1050 counts , of which @xmath11100 counts originated at a point - like source and the rest corresponded to diffuse emission @xcite .",
    "the observations of ngc7293 detected 2,100@xmath1050 counts , all from a point - like source .",
    "chandra _ coordinates of both point - like sources are within 1@xmath12 of the coordinates of the central stars derived from the digitized sky survey . to further examine their relative positions ,",
    "we have matched field stellar sources detected in the acis observations with bright stars in the digitized sky survey . when the field sources are aligned , we find that the agreement in position between the point - like x - ray source and the central star is better than 05 for both ngc6543 and ngc7293 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these point - like x - ray sources are coincident with the central stars .",
    "it is difficult to assess whether the point - like x - ray source at ngc6543 s central star is truly unresolved because only @xmath11100 counts are detected and it is superposed on bright diffuse x - ray  emission .",
    "this point - like x - ray source can not be a local peak of the diffuse emission because  they  have  different spectral shapes ( see  3.2 ) ; thus , it is likely a true point source associated with the central  star .",
    "the acis observations of ngc7293 have detected adequate counts to allow an accurate comparison between the surface brightness profile of the point - like source and the instrumental point spread function .",
    "the fwhm of the surface brightness profile of the x - ray source in ngc7293 is 08 , comparable to the instrumental fwhm .",
    "therefore , the x - ray source in ngc7293 is unresolved , and is a true  point \" source .",
    "the spectrum of the point source at the central star of ngc6543 was extracted using a round source aperture of 11 radius and a concentric annular background aperture of radii from 15 to 25 .",
    "the background region was selected to be representative of the diffuse emission in the central region of the nebula while avoiding the bright emission along the rim ( see image of diffuse emission in * ? ? ?",
    "the background - subtracted spectrum of the central star of ngc6543 is presented in fig .",
    "1 . it shows emission - line features at 0.450.7 kev and @xmath13 kev , and much fainter emission at higher energies in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 kev .",
    "the feature between 0.45 and 0.7 kev is brighter and wider , and corresponds to the he - like triplet of at @xmath110.57  kev and the h - like ly@xmath14 line of at 0.65  kev .",
    "the feature at @xmath13 kev is fainter and may be attributed to the he - like triplet of at @xmath110.92  kev .",
    "the spectrum at 1.02.0 kev has too few counts for us to determine whether it is line or continuum emission .",
    "the line features in the spectrum of the central star of ngc6543 are consistent with thermal plasma emission .",
    "the number of counts is too small for reliable spectral fits ; therefore , we will limit our analysis to the comparison of the observed spectral shape with thermal plasma emission models convolved with an absorption column and the instrumental response . for this",
    ", we used the mekal model in the xspec software package @xcite , and an absorption column density , @xmath1510@xmath16 @xmath17 , determined from the acis - s spectral fits of the diffuse emission from ngc6543 @xcite .",
    "solar abundances are adopted for both the emitting plasma and absorbing material .",
    "several models have been considered to simulate the observed spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for models with one temperature component , the relative intensity of the emission features at 0.450.7 kev and @xmath13 kev can be simulated only if the abundance of ne is greatly enhanced from the solar value ; the best model has a plasma temperature of @xmath18 2@xmath1910@xmath0  k. for models with two temperature components , no anomalous ne abundances are needed , and the observed spectral shape can be described by a mekal model with @xmath20  k and @xmath21  k. the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity , calculated from either the best one- or two - temperature model , is @xmath22 erg  s@xmath2 in the 0.32.0 kev band , for a distance of 1 kpc @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the point source at the central star of ngc7293 was extracted using a round source aperture of 15 radius and a concentric annular background aperture of radii from 10  to 25 .",
    "the background - subtracted spectrum ( fig .",
    "2a ) shows emission from 0.3 to 2.0 kev with numerous line features ( note that acis is not sensitive to the soft x - ray component detected by @xmath23 ) .",
    "the emission in the energy range of 0.50.7 kev consists of the lines at 0.57 kev and line at 0.65 kev .",
    "note that the relative intensities of the and lines of ngc7293 are reversed from those of ngc6543 , indicating a higher plasma temperature for the source in ngc7293 .",
    "the peak emission , in the energy range of 0.70.85 kev , corresponds to the lines at @xmath110.73 kev and @xmath110.83 kev .",
    "the secondary peak , at 0.9 kev , is attributed to lines at @xmath110.92 kev .",
    "the line and fel blend at 1.02 kev and 1.10 kev , respectively , can also be identified in the spectrum . in the energy range above 1.1 kev ,",
    "the emission drops off steadily ; the low s / n ratio prevents us from identifying the emission lines unambiguously .",
    "the spectrum of the point source in ngc7293 has been fit using the mekal model . the best fit ( see fig .",
    "2a ) has @xmath2410@xmath0  k and @xmath25 @xmath17 .",

    "the 47.7 ks observations of ngc7293 were made in two intervals , 36.7 ks and 11.0 ks , separated by a 22.6 ks gap .",
    "we have examined the temporal variation of the brightness of the source over this time span by dividing the observations into nine roughly equal time bins .",

    "the count rates from the final two bins , on the other hand , show a noticeable decrease from the first time interval .",
    "both the peak - to - peak variation and the difference between the mean of the first seven bins and the mean of the last two bins have greater than 3@xmath31 significance .",
    "these results provide the first detection of short - term variability of the x - ray source in ngc7293 .",
    "it has been suggested that the hard x - ray emission from the central star of ngc7293 originates from the interaction between its stellar wind and the surrounding nebula @xcite , because central stars of pns often exhibit energetic fast stellar winds @xcite . such interacting - wind models @xcite show that the pn interior is filled with hot gas ( the shocked fast wind ) , and the x - ray emission from the hot gas will peak near the inner wall of the pn shell , where the density of the hot gas is raised by the mass evaporation across the interface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "diffuse x - ray emission compatible with this picture has been detected by _",

    "2001 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the observed spectra are consistent with a thin plasma at a few @xmath1910@xmath0 k.    the acis spectra of the central stars of ngc6543 and ngc7293 are qualitatively similar to those expected in the wind - nebula interaction models , but the x - ray emission is confined to the vicinity of the central star as opposed to peaking near the inner wall of the pn shell .",
    "furthermore , the central star of ngc7293 currently does not seem to possess a measurable fast stellar wind @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that the x - ray emission from these point sources originates from wind - nebula interaction .",
    "shocks in fast stellar winds are believed to be responsible for the x - ray emission from massive o and b stars ( cassinelli et al .",

    "while the central star of ngc7293 does not have a measurable fast wind , the central star of ngc6543 does exhibit a strong fast stellar wind @xcite . with an @xmath34 of @xmath35 ergs  s@xmath2 @xcite",
    ", the @xmath36 of the central star of ngc6543 is within the range expected for sources with wind shocks .",
    "therefore , the x - ray emission from the central star of ngc6543 may originate from shocks in its fast stellar wind .",
    "a compact object with a close binary companion may form an accretion disk and emit x - rays ( e.g. , the low- and high - mass x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the maximum temperature that can be achieved in the accretion disk material scales with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass and radius of the accreting star , and @xmath40 is the mass transfer rate in the binary system @xcite . for a radius of 0.01 r@xmath41 and a mass of 0.6 m@xmath41 , typical for pn central stars ,",
    "the maximum temperature achievable in the accretion disk is well below 10@xmath42 k for a mass transfer rate of @xmath43 m@xmath41  yr@xmath2 .",
    "no x - ray emission is expected from such cold accretion disks .",
    "alternatively , the accreted mass may fall onto the surface of a compact object directly and emit x - rays .",
    "for white dwarfs , the infall velocity is so high that a shock develops above the star and the infalling gas is shock - heated to 10@xmath44 k and emits x - rays , e.g. , dwarf novae , polars , and intermediate polars @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the central stars of ngc6543 and ngc7293 are clearly too soft ; furthermore , the optical brightness does not show the large variability observed in white dwarfs that accrete mass at high rates ( a.  landolt , private communication ) .",
    "accretion of material from a close binary companion can not contribute to the observed x - ray emission from these point sources .",
    "x - ray emission from stellar coronae has similar spectral properties to the x - ray emission from the central stars of ngc6543 and ngc7293 .",
    "coronal activity is powered by convection and differential rotation in the envelopes of late type f  k stars and dme flare stars ( dwarf m stars with emission lines ) . evolved stars , going from the end of the agb phase to the proto - pn stage , may also have convective envelopes @xcite . as a star evolves into a white dwarf",
    ", however , the ionization of h and he in its photosphere increases , and the convection and coronal activity will cease at @xmath45 k @xcite .",
    "neither ngc6543 nor ngc7293 are proto - pns .",
    "in fact , the central star of ngc7293 is already a 100,000  k hot white dwarf .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that they have coronal activity to produce the observed x - ray emission .",
    "it is possible that the central stars of ngc6543 and ngc7293 have binary companions with coronal activity .",

    "furthermore , the broad ( @xmath47 km  s@xmath2 ) variable h@xmath14 emission from the central star of ngc7293 recently detected by @xcite is similar to that seen during flares of dme stars .",
