    "the end of the `` dark ages '' , sometime between redshifts of 6@xmath850 , is signalled by the formation of the first galactic and proto - galactic structures",
    ". the detection and characterization of these early objects is essential for identifying the sources of re - ionization and revealing if galaxies in the early universe build their stellar mass primarily through monolithic collapse or hierarchical merging .",
    "potential sources responsible for re - ionization include supermassive black holes in bright qsos , violently star - forming galaxies and exotic but hypothetical population  iii stars thought to be of mass @xmath9  m@xmath4 .",
    "however , qsos have been effectively ruled out based on their luminosity function at @xmath10 determined from the sloan digitized sky survey @xcite and deeper , narrower field of view quasar surveys @xcite .",
    "star - forming galaxies are likely to dominate the re - ionization only if the faint end slope of the uv luminosity function at @xmath11 is steeper than the slope at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , of all the @xmath13 candidates identified in various survey fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the only spectroscopically confirmed @xmath14 sources are the emission line galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at @xmath13 was hcm  6a ( @xmath15 ) , discovered by @xcite in a narrowband imaging survey of lensing galaxy cluster fields and confirmed through the detection of redshifted ly@xmath1 .",
    "the source is magnified by the foreground cluster abell  370 by a factor of 4.5 and appears to be fragmented into two components separated by @xmath16 in the north - east / south - west direction .",
    "the ly@xmath1 line and uv continuum luminosity correspond to a star - formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath17 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "this does not include any corrections for dust , since the existence of dust and absorption are quite uncertain from the purely rest - frame ultraviolet data previously obtained for hcm  6a .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report on the _ spitzer _ detection of hcm  6a using the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "irac , due to its exquisite sensitivity , has been successful in detecting the rest - frame optical emission from candidate and confirmed @xmath18 sources in the goods fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in fields which are lensed by massive clusters @xcite .",
    "these measurements provide a better constraint on the physical properties of high redshift galaxies such as the stellar mass , age of the stellar population and internal dust extinction .",
    "the _ spitzer_/irac observations were undertaken as part of guaranteed time observations .",
    "data at 3.6  @xmath2 m and 5.8  @xmath2 m were taken with 12 dithered 200  sec exposures , for a total on - source integration time of 2400  sec . at 4.5",
    "@xmath2 m and 8.0  @xmath2 m , 18 dithered 200  sec exposures were used for a total on - source integration time of 3600  s.    we made minor modifications to the pipeline - processed data .",
    "beginning with the basic calibrated data from the irac pipeline ( version s11.0.2 ) , we corrected the `` pulldown '' and `` muxbleed '' associated with well - exposed pixels in irac channels 1 ( 3.6 @xmath2 m ) and 2 ( 4.5 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "the muxbleed corrections were empirically derived from a large set of irac data taken with the same exposure time .",
    "we then reran the mopex mosaicing software with modified cosmic - ray rejection parameters and an output pixel scale reduced by 50%  to improve the resolution of the final images .",
    "the spatial resolution in the combined mosaics is @xmath19 fwhm .",
    "the @xmath20 sensitivity of our final mosaics was measured by calculating the standard deviation between the flux values in 18 radius beams placed along random blank points in the mosaic .",
    "the resultant 1@xmath21 point source detection limits , corrected for beam size , were 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.9 and 1.0  @xmath2jy at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "the expected @xmath20 background - limited point source sensitivity values are 0.14 , 0.23 , 1.85 and 1.93  @xmath2jy for medium background .",
    "the difference between the two sets of values , especially at the shortest wavelengths , is mostly attributable to confusion noise and partly due to the correlated noise between pixels .",
    "the @xmath0 source ( hcm  6a ) is detected in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath2 m mosaics ( figure  1 ) . at the spatial resolution of irac ,",
    "the neighboring , bright galaxy @xmath226  to the southwest ( @xmath23 ) could be contaminating the photometry of the high - redshift source .",
    "we first attempted to perform the photometry on hcm  6a using a priors - based deblending technique whereby we use the position of sources in high resolution _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfpc2 images of the field , convolve them with the _ spitzer _ point spread function ( psf ) and subtract them out .",
    "however , because of the extended morphology of the foreground galaxy , likely morphological @xmath24-corrections , and the position dependence of the irac psf , the residuals from this technique were found to be rather large and unsuitable .",
    "prior - based deblending is most effective when sources are unresolved .",
    "we then adopted an alternate approach .",
    "after measuring aperture - corrected fluxes of @xmath25jy and @xmath26jy at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath2 m , respectively , for hcm  6a , we attempted to estimate the contribution of the foreground galaxy to these values .",
    "we derived surface brightness profiles of the bright galaxy in expanding annuli , fit those with an analytical function and extrapolated the function to assess the surface brightness of the galaxy at the location of hcm  6a .",
    "we find that the the maximal contribution from the galaxy to the flux of hcm  6a is @xmath27jy at 3.6  @xmath2 m and 4.5  @xmath2 m and 1.7  @xmath2jy at 8.0  @xmath2 m , depending on the functional form of the surface brightness profile .",
    "we subtract an average value of @xmath28jy and @xmath29jy at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath2 m , respectively , for the galaxy contribution and adopt flux values of @xmath30jy and @xmath31jy at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath2 m , respectively , for hcm 6a .    at 5.8  @xmath2 m",
    "we provide a @xmath20 upper limit of 0.9  @xmath2jy while at 8.0  @xmath2 m there is a hint of a positive flux , @xmath32jy .",
    "given the noise properties of the mosaic and blending from the foreground , bright galaxy , we classify the 5.8  @xmath2 m and 8.0  @xmath2 m values as 1@xmath21 upper limits , the 3.6  @xmath2 m value as a @xmath33 detection , and the 4.5  @xmath2 m value as a @xmath34 detection .",
    "the faintness of the source and detectability at the limits of the irac instrument , despite a lensing amplification factor of 4.5 , illustrate the difficulty associated with a detailed study of the @xmath35 galaxy population .    to assess the reliability of the source and the photometry , we selected a random 2/3 of the 4.5@xmath2 m frames and re - generated the mosaic , repeating the process 3 times .",
    "the photometry was performed on each of these mosaics , with the difference between the values yielding a systematic uncertainty which is factored into the aforementioned flux density estimates .",
    "we also investigated the effect of modifying the mosaicing parameters , which included making the outlier rejection threshold more stringent .",
    "we find the photometry to be insensitive to these parameters .",
    "finally , we briefly note that the peak of the 4.5  @xmath2 m emission is offset mostly to the north from the peak of the 3.6  @xmath2 m emission by @xmath36 .",
    "this is less than the fwhm of the psf at these wavelengths , but is much greater than the 02 relative astrometric accuracy between the irac images in the various channels , as measured from the scatter in the centroid of bright sources .",
    "furthermore , the peak of the 3.6  @xmath2 m emission is well aligned with the continuum source detected by @xcite .",
    "this offset is most likely attributable to the extended nature of the ly-@xmath1 source .",
    "it is possible that one of the two optical components of hcm 6a is dominating the h@xmath1 emission , affecting the 4.5  @xmath2 m morphology and centroiding .",
    "regardless , since the separation of the two components is less than the irac psf , we only consider emission from the entire ensemble .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of hcm  6a at all detected wavelengths including the ground - based photometry from @xcite .",
    "since the balmer break for a galaxy at @xmath0 falls shortward of the irac 3.6  @xmath2 m filter and the source is known to have a strong ly@xmath1 emission line , we interpret the upturn in the sed at 4.5  @xmath2 m flux to be due to the presence of h@xmath1 which , at a redshifted wavelength of 4.96  @xmath2 m , falls within the irac 4.5  @xmath2 m passband .",
    "the presence of ly@xmath1 suggests that the object is a young star - forming galaxy .",
    "we tentatively assume that the continuum follows a simple @xmath37 spectrum and fit it to the flux density at wavelengths which are not contaminated by line emission , i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and 3.6  @xmath2 m . extrapolating this continuum to 4.5  @xmath2",
    "m yields a continuum level of @xmath41jy .",
    "the continuum is slightly decreased to @xmath42jy if the @xmath43-band photometric point is included but can be as high as @xmath44jy if the continuum slope is red due to dust or an evolved stellar population .",
    "these estimates are about a factor of 2@xmath83 below the measured flux of @xmath45jy at 4.5  @xmath2 m .",
    "we attribute the difference to the presence of h@xmath1 + [ ] emission .",
    "the resultant combined line luminosity is in the range @xmath46  erg  s@xmath5 which factors in the uncertainty in the continuum level as well as the photometry . when corrected for the lensing magnification factor of 4.5 and a canonical [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio of 0.3 @xcite , this implies a h@xmath1 line luminosity of @xmath47  erg  s@xmath5 and a resultant star - formation rate of 140@xmath4890  m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 using the @xcite sfr relation .",
    "the implied rest - frame h@xmath1 equivalent width of @xmath220.2  @xmath2 m is not unreasonable for young stellar populations ( c.f .",
    "typical systematic uncertainties are about a factor of 4 , arising from the uncertainty in the lensing magnification factor ( @xmath492 ) and the [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio which can span the 0.1 - 1 range .",
    "the derived sfr is about an order of magnitude higher than that derived from the uv continuum @xcite . assuming this is a result of dust , the implied extinction is @xmath501.0  mag .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the presence of dust is remarkable , requiring a significantly evolved stellar population to already be in place by redshift @xmath15 .",
    "apparently , even at the highest redshifts currently probed , we are still not identifying primordial stellar populations .",
    "this is consistent with spectroscopic studies of the most distant galaxies .",
    "@xmath511640   , predicted to be a major coolant in very low metallicity systems and thus a good tracer of population  iii stars , remains undetected in stacked spectra of multiple , high - redshift galaxies @xcite or in ultradeep spectra of individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "the likely implication of this dust detection and the non - detections is that significant star formation occurs at redshifts @xmath52 .",
    "we next attempted to fit the photometric measurements of the galaxy with a @xcite template sed to constrain its mass .",
    "templates with metallicity values of 0.02 solar and with a salpeter imf were adopted .",
    "the imf at these redshifts is a significant source of uncertainty since a top - heavy imf could produce the same emission line flux with a considerably lower sfr .",
    "the lensing factor of 4.5 was removed from the flux estimates . the uncertainty in the lensing magnification factor",
    "does not dominate the uncertainties in the sed fitting which are driven by the large photometric errors .",
    "the 4.5  @xmath2 m photometry was replaced by the continuum level after the h@xmath1 + [ ] lines were subtracted .",
    "we find that the best fit template corresponds to a stellar mass of @xmath53  m@xmath4 , an instantaneous starburst age of 5 myr , and @xmath54  mag .",
    "the low resultant age is consistent with the strong emission lines in this galaxy although the mass estimate is uncertain to @xmath4910 .",
    "an alternate interpretation is that the flux in all passbands is dominated by the continuum emission rather than the line emission . repeating the bruzual - charlot fits results in a galaxy with mass in stars of @xmath55  m@xmath4 , a starburst age of 30 myr and @xmath56  mag .",
    "template fits with extinction forced to zero , ages of 700 myr and masses of @xmath57  m@xmath4 also provide reasonable fits to the photometry ( figure 2 ) .",
    "however , the formal , reduced @xmath58 estimate for these fits is about 2@xmath83 times higher than fits with the h@xmath1 contribution subtracted .",
    "the remarkable agreement between the extinction values independently derived from the ratio of h@xmath1 to ly@xmath1 emission lines and the fit to the broadband photometry , therefore leads us to conclude that our first hypothesis , that the 4.5  @xmath2 m flux is dominated by h@xmath1 in emission and that the galaxy has an intrinsic extinction of @xmath59  mag , is more amenable to the data .",
    "we assess the possibility that the unusual photometry of this narrow - line ly@xmath1 emitter ( lae ) could be due to the presence of an agn .",
    "a @xmath22100ks _ chandra _ x - ray observation of this field does not reveal the presence of an x - ray counterpart for hcm 6a . based on the data presented in @xcite and @xcite , the lensing uncorrected limiting flux",
    "is @xmath2210@xmath60  erg  @xmath61  s@xmath5 between 2 - 7 kev and 3@xmath4910@xmath62  erg  @xmath61  s@xmath5 between 0.5 - 2 kev .",
    "this translates to f@xmath63/f@xmath64 which is small but still more than a factor of 5 larger than the range of flux ratios seen for the sloan quasars at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath1 to x - ray flux ratio limit for hcm6a is @xmath65 .",
    "this limit is within the range of high redshift type ii qsos .",
    "however , deep x - ray observations of the narrow - line ly@xmath1 emitter population at @xmath66 yield similar detection limits for individual objects .",
    "x - ray stacking of these 101 laes yields a non - detection which is @xmath67 times higher than the ratio for type ii qsos implying that less than 5% of these objects could have agn @xcite . since hcm6a is very similar in properties to the laes , we infer that it too does not host an agn .    in figure  3",
    ", we compare the photometric properties of hcm  6a discussed in this paper with other @xmath13 candidates from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hcm 6a is the only one of these sources with detected ly@xmath1 and with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift .",
    "the derived ages of the stellar population for the other sources are much larger , spanning @xmath68   myr , while hcm  6a spans @xmath69  myr , albeit with large uncertainties due to the lower flux density and correspondingly lower signal to noise .",
    "the mass derived for the @xcite galaxy is very similar to hcm  6a while the estimate of the mass for the @xcite galaxy is three orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the range of masses and ages spanned at @xmath70 suggests that the growth of galaxies occurs along different evolutionary channels , whereby some galaxies undergo monolithic collapse , forming the bulk of their stars in a single burst at very high redshift , while others , like hcm  6a , build their stellar mass in the hierarchical merging scenario .",
    "if hcm  6a is typical of the emission line galaxy population as seems to be the case , reddening could explain the sharp decrease in the cosmic star - formation rate seen at @xmath11 by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite relative to the extinction corrected values of @xcite .",
    "hcm  6a has a derived dust extinction of @xmath54  mag , corresponding to @xmath71 of 2.6  mag .",
    "this would boost the @xmath13 star - formation rate of @xmath72  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  mpc@xmath73 derived by @xcite by an order of magnitude .",
    "dust is predominantly formed in the shells of red giant stars which would barely have sufficient time to evolve when the age of the universe is 850  myr .",
    "the implication is that the first epoch of star - formation in hcm 6a , occured at @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , if dust reddening were an unexpectedly significant factor at @xmath35 , the re - ionization of the igm could be accounted for by the luminous end of the star - forming galaxy population without resorting to a steep faint end slope",
    ". measures of dust extinction in a larger sample of emission - line galaxies can test this hypothesis and is currently under investigation .",
