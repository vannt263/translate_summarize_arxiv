    "recent high accuracy observations , such as cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb)@xcite , and the large scale structure ( lss)@xcite , provide us wealthy information on the universe .",
    "currently , so called concordance cosmological model , in which approximately scale - invariant , gaussian , adiabatic primordial perturbations seed the structure of our universe , is mostly favored . however , there exist some models which predict non - negligible isocurvature perturbations , such as multiple scalar fields inflation@xcite and curvaton@xcite models .",
    "the primordial isocurvature perturbations then can induce the cosmological matter perturbations such as cold dark matter ( cdm ) , baryons , dark energy and neutrino@xcite in the radiation era .",
    "although the pure isocurvature perturbations have already been ruled out by the observation of boomerang and maxima-1@xcite , models with primordial perturbations comprised of dominate adiabatic and a small fraction of isocurvature modes@xcite still survive . due to the quality of data , we still can not confirm the destiny of the isocurvature perturbation .",
    "moreover , if we switch off the isocurvature perturbations naively , the result would be misleading@xcite .",
    "so , it is important to seek a way to detect the isocurvature perturbations and give stringent constraints on isocurvature perturbations parameters .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have given constraints on parameters of two different cosmological models with latest astronomical data .",
    "one is with pure adiabatic initial condition ( ic ) and the other is with mixed ic in which small fraction of isocurvature mode is correlated with dominating adiabatic mode through @xmath3 .",
    "we found that compared to adiabatic mode , the isocurvature perturbations have smaller amplitude ( @xmath4 ) and bluer tilt ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "that is to say the isocurvature modes is pronounced on small scales ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , on these scales , the structure grows non - linearly , so we can not study the details of evolution in a full analytical way and then test them against future high - precision observations .    on the other way ,",
    "n - body simulations plays more and more important role in cosmology nowadays , especially in the study of nonlinearity .",
    "it can make predictions and compare with observations for a specific model .",
    "it can also be used to check the validity of a particular method @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the effects of cdm isocurvature perturbations on lss by implementing n - body simulations .",
    "given the best fit parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite , we carry out four sets of simulations with different ics in different boxes .",
    "we find that , unlike the power spectrum and two point correlation function , mass function is sensitive to dark matter isocurvature perturbations .",
    "this indicates that , we can give stringent constraints on dark matter isocurvature perturbations with future high precision cluster counts experiment .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ic ] , we briefly introduce the cdm isocurvature perturbation and set the ics for n - body simulation . in sec .",

    "generally , to calculate matter power spectra @xmath7 numerically , one start from the time @xmath8 deep in the radiation dominated era , when all interesting scales of perturbations are outside the horizon .",
    "however , @xmath8 is different from the time @xmath9 when the corresponding mode @xmath10 exits horizon during inflation .",
    "therefore , one need transfer function @xmath11 to transform perturbations from @xmath9 to @xmath8 .    as we know",
    ", in the absence of isocurvature perturbations , the adiabatic perturbations @xmath12 are conserved on superhorizon scales . on the contrary",
    ", the isocurvature perturbations @xmath13 can evolve on superhorizon scale and can also seed adiabatic perturbations .",
    "thus , the transfer function @xmath11 can be written as@xcite [ evol ]    ( t_ic ) + ( t_ic )    =    1 & t _ + 0 & t _",
    "( t _ * ) + ( t _ * )    , where @xmath11 is model dependent . to investigate isocurvature perturbation without making use of any specific model ,",

    ". the amplitude of the spectra @xmath18 can be written as a_s^ij=    a_s^adi & + & a_s^iso    , where @xmath21 describes the correlation between adiabatic mode and isocurvature mode @xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand for the amplitude of adiabatic and isocurvature modes , respectively .",
    "the spectra index @xmath19 is n_s^ij=    n_s^adi&n^cor_s + n^cor_s & n_s^iso    , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the spectra indices for adiabatic and isocurvaure modes . here",

    "the presence of dark matter isocurvature perturbation would alter the position of first peak in the cmb angular power spectrum , which is the right scale of bao .",
    "the peak in the two point correlation function and the wiggles in the power spectrum are the useful tools to track the behavior of bao@xcite .    we calculate the 2-point correlation function for set i at @xmath30 with the pair - count estimator proposed by landy @xmath31 szalay@xcite : ( r ) = , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the autocorrelation function of the simulation particles and randomly sampled points respectively , @xmath34 is the cross - correlation between the data and random points . from fig .",
    "[ fig:2pcf ] , we can find that , the position and width of bao from which @xmath35 and @xmath36 are extracted , are almost the same for the two different simulations .",
    "this result is reasonable in two aspects .",
    "firstly , the bao observation mainly depends on the background parameter , while has little to do with the origin of the perturbations ; secondly , we set ics with best fit parameters .",
    "the behavior on large scales ( @xmath37 ) is well constrained@xcite , especially the position of first peak in the cmb angular power spectrum@xcite .",
    "it implies that , if the isocurvature fraction is small enough , we can not discriminate two initial conditions from bao observation .",

    ", @xmath43 reaches about @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "that is to say , the largest discrepancy in power spectrum is about @xmath0 .",
    "what we have to keep in mind is that we have renormalized the initial power spectra to the same @xmath51 and the weight @xmath52 peaks around @xmath53 .",
    "so , the power spectra we got from n - body simulations with mixed ic should be similar to the one with adiabatic ic on large scales while be larger on small scales without renormalization .",
    "mass function is defined as the abundance of dark matter haloes in a specific mass ranges .",
    "it is a key quantity to describe the large scale structure in the nonlinear regime .",
    "press and schechter firstly provided the theoretical description in a simple spherical collapse model@xcite .",
    "subsequently , people made some improvements on this simple modelling and introduced more complex ellipsoidal collapse models@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a lot of literatures try to fit the halo mass function in the manner of n - body simulation@xcite .",
    "we identify haloes with ahf ( amiga s halo find)@xcite , an adaptive mesh based finder . after placing grid across the box and further refinement",

    "moreover , we only keep haloes with at least 20 dark matter particles , i.e. the mimimum mass of haloes is around @xmath57 .",
    "we introduce the cumulative mass function which is defined as mean number densities of haloes with mass larger than a specific mass , n(>m ) = , where @xmath58 is the number of haloes with mass greater than m. this is related to the mass function @xmath59 through n(>m ) & = & _ m^dm + & = & _ m^f()dm        the cumulative mass function as well as the ratio @xmath60 for simulation set ii at redshifts @xmath2 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf320 ] .",
    "we can find that the mass function is almost the same on large mass scale , from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",

    "moreover , the discrepancy increases as the mass gets smaller . for @xmath66 ,",

    "we find that the ratio decreases as time evolves .",
    "compared to @xmath70 at @xmath50 , the ratio at @xmath2 is only @xmath71 .",
    "this behavior can be ascribed to the late - time non - linear evolution .",
    "that is to say , a high - redshift survey is helpful to seek the dm isocurvature perturbations signal .",
    "since we have renormalized to the same @xmath51 , the power on large scales for mixed ic is less than for adiabatic ic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : power512 ] ) , and there should be more haloes for mixed ic than for the adiabatic one without renormalization .",
    "isocurvature perturbations , inevitably generated from multi - field inflation or curvaton models , can be used to test these models . although pure isocurvature perturbation models have already been ruled out ,",
    "there still exists possibility that a small fraction of isocurvature mode is correlated to the dominating adiabatic perturbation .",
    "this is important to the parameter estimation , since rough ignorance would lead to biased result .    with the best fit values obtained in ref.@xcite , we perform four sets of n - body simulations to seek a best way to detect the isocurvature perturbations .",
    "we find that , if the fraction is small enough(@xmath72 ) we can not peek it in the bao observation .",
    "the position and the width of the bump in two - point correlation function , which mainly depend on the background parameter , are almost the same .",
    "there are some differences in matter power spectrum and halo mass function .",
    "however , the @xmath0 difference in matter power spectra makes it hard to be observed . on the contrary",
    ", the deviation in the halo mass function is obvious .",
    "the difference is getting larger as we go to higher redshift . for @xmath73",
    "the discrepancy can get @xmath1 at @xmath2 .",
