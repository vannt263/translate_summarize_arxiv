    "the ising model in dimension @xmath4 is of particular interest since it is the first case where the model is strictly above its upper critical dimension @xmath5 .",
    "rigorous results @xcite establish that the critical exponents of the model assume their mean field values . here",
    "the specific heat exponent @xmath6 , and the results of @xcite also imply that the specific heat is bounded at the critical point .",
    "recent simulation results @xcite also indicate that , just as for the mean field case , the specific heat is discontinuous at the critical point .",
    "in contrast to these asymptotic results there has been a long running debate over the finite size scaling for the model with free boundary conditions .",
    "we ll refer the reader to @xcite for a fuller overview of the history and stick to the presently most relevant parts here . for @xmath4 and cyclic boundary conditions",
    "there is agreement that e.g. @xmath7 for a lattice of side @xmath8 .",
    "the conventional picture for the free boundary case is that @xmath9 .",
    "however , it has also been suggested @xcite that the free boundary case should scale in the same way as the cyclic boundary case near the finite size susceptibility maximum . a computational study @xcite of the , then , largest lattices possible supported the conventional picture , but in @xcite it was suggested this was due to an underestimate of the influence of the large boundaries of the used systems . for systems",
    "exactly at the critical coupling this issue was resolved in @xcite where a study of systems up to @xmath10 demonstrated an increasingly good agreement with the conventional picture as the system size was increased .",
    "but , this left the behaviour in the rest of the critical scaling window open .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to extend the study of large systems from @xcite to the full critical window , including the location of the maximum of @xmath11 , and give the best possible estimates for the scaling behaviour in the coupling region discussed by all the previous papers .",
    "apart from the susceptibility we also study properties of the fortuin - kasteleyn cluster containing the origin and use those to estimate both the susceptibility and the correlation length of the model .",
    "to concretize , the predictions from @xcite are that the location of the maximum for @xmath11 will scale as @xmath12 and the maximum value as @xmath13 .",
    "the more recent @xcite agrees with these predictions , and also the prediction from @xcite that the location of the maximum of the susceptibility should scale as @xmath14 , as does @xcite , but both are based on smaller system sizes than those considered in the present work .    in short ,",
    "our conclusion is that the data is well fitted by the conventional scaling picture , both for the location and value of the susceptibility , and location of the finite size critical point for the magnetization .",
    "for a given graph @xmath15 on @xmath16 vertices the hamiltonian with interactions of unit strength along the edges is @xmath17 where the sum is taken over the edges @xmath18 . here",
    "the graph @xmath15 is a @xmath19-dimensional grid graph of linear order @xmath8 with free boundary conditions , i.e. a cartesian product of @xmath19 paths on @xmath8 vertices , so that the number of vertices is @xmath20 and the number of edges is @xmath21 .",

    "we will define a rescaled coupling as @xmath26 which gives a scaling window of width @xmath1 .",

    "let @xmath41 denote the average size of a flipped cluster and recall  @xcite that @xmath42 .",
    "we use the subscript @xmath43 to denote the origin ( i.e. centre ) vertex of the grid @xmath15 so that @xmath44 is the average size of a cluster containing the origin .",
    "the event that a cluster containing the origin also reaches the boundary @xmath45 of the graph is denoted @xmath46 .",
    "we have collected data using wolff - cluster spin updating for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 for a wide and dense set of @xmath56-values in @xmath57 .",
    "the data include e.g. magnetisation , energy ( @xmath58 ) , size and radius of the origin cluster .",
    "the total number of measurements range from about @xmath59 for the small systems ( @xmath60 ) down to @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath2 .",
    "we begin by establishing the natural width of the scaling window , i.e. the form of a natural rescaled temperature .",
    "we have already defined the rescaled coupling as @xmath26 with the expectation that this will be the relevant scaling . in principle , the location of different effective finite size critical points could scale with different exponents and we will compare a number of such possibilities .",
    "we used a 2nd order interpolation of the data points to estimate the location of the maximum for three different parameters : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "the case @xmath156 corresponds to ordinary percolation and @xmath157 gives the random spanning tree for the lattice .    for the random spanning tree pemantle @xcite proved that for large enough @xmath158 the distance between two points in the tree scales as @xmath14 with free boundary and as @xmath159 with cyclic boundary . for percolation ,",

    "this conjecture was later proven in @xcite .",
    "so , for both @xmath162 and @xmath156 we have rigorous results showing that free and cyclic boundary conditions lead to distinct scalings .",
    "aizenman s conjectured scaling @xmath161 came from the fact that the cyclic boundary case was expected to behave like the critical erds - renyi random graph , where the maximum cluster has size @xmath163 , where @xmath16 is the number of vertices , which would be @xmath164 for the lattice . again , there are detailed rigorous results @xcite concerning the random cluster model on the complete graph and in @xcite it was demonstrated that monte carlo data for the fk - model with @xmath155 and @xmath4 with cyclic boundary gives a detailed agreement with the scaling for the complete graph . in particular , the size of the largest cluster has the same scaling for both graphs for several different rescaled coupling ranges .    now , the @xmath14 scaling observed in this paper for the origin cluster can be seen as an indicator of the correct scaling of the largest cluster as well .",
    "this would give a scaling which is different for the free and cyclic boundary cases , just as one would expect from the known results for lower @xmath165 .",
    "in @xcite the authors conjectured that for every @xmath165 there is a @xmath166 such that above this dimension the fk - model with cyclic boundary behaves like the model on a complete graph , giving a partial generalisation of aizenmann s conjecture for all @xmath165 .",
    "in fact , we also expect the model with free boundary to follow a simpler mean - field scaling , similar to that seen on an infinite tree , or bethe lattice .",
    "the fact that there are several distinct basic model systems , e.g. the complete graphs and the bethe lattices , which on one hand have mean field critical exponents but on the other hand differ on more detailed properties is probably under - appreciated in the older literature .",
