    "all real - world networks are weighted .",
    "let us explain this strong claim in more detail .",
    "usual objects of interest in the science of networks are relatively simple nets where all edges have equal `` weights '' @xcite .",
    "the elements of the adjacency matrices of these networks are ones and zeros .",
    "we stress that these simple graphs are only parodies of real networks where connections between vertices are not equal .",
    "edge weights are introduced to describe this diversity . in the simplest case , which we discuss here ,",
    "weights are positive numbers @xcite ( see fig .",
    "so , the elements of the resulting adjacency matrices are zeros and positive numbers , @xmath0 .",
    "however , in principle , in more complex situation , edges may be described by a set of variables or operators .",
    "note that an extra set of variables may be introduced to describe an individual properties of vertices ( so called hidden variables @xcite ) .",
    "edge weights allow one to better describe reality .",
    "for example , in the simplest , unweighted version of a network of social contacts , each edge connects a pair of individuals who had one or two or more contacts . in a far more informative weighted network of social contacts ,",
    "the weight of an edge shows the frequency of recent contacts between the corresponding pair of persons @xcite .",
    "another example is a network of coauthorships , where edge weights show the number of joint papers of two coauthors @xcite .",
    "( this network may be treated as a one - mode projection of a bipartite graph . )",
    "note that networks with multiple connections can be considered as weighted ones with integer edge weights .",
    "weighted networks provide an informative , usable picture of reality .",
    "our first example is collaboration networks .",
    "collaborations are adequately represented by bipartite collaboration graphs , where one kind of vertices is collaborators and the other one is acts of collaboration [ see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , graph  a ] .",
    "usually , empirical researchers consider one - mode projections of these graphs , where a pair of vertices - collaborators is interconnected by an edge if there has been at least one act of collaboration between them [ see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , graph b ] .",
    "this net is more simple than the original bipartite graph , but an essential information is lost . in particular , one can not recover the bipartite original by using this projection . the weighted one - mode projection shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , graph c , is more informative than unweighted projection b but , nonetheless , is less informative than original bipartite graph a. one still can not recover bipartite graph a if weighted projection c is known .",
    "the second example is energy landscape networks , where each vertex is a local minimum of the potential energy landscape , and an edge connects two minima with a saddle point between them @xcite .",
    "an unweighted version of this network reflects only a general structure of connections in the configuration space of a system .",
    "in contrast , directed weighted graphs , where edge weights indicate transition rates provide basic necessary information about the relaxation and kinetics of a system .",
    "( one may also ascribe the energies of the potential minima to the vertices , and the energies of the saddle points to the edges . )",
    "the third example is various chemical reaction networks @xcite ( e.g. , networks of metabolic reactions @xcite ) . in a one - partite version of these networks ,",
    "weights show the chemical reaction weights .",
    "networks of corporate ownerships are also directed weighted graphs ( edge weights indicate the fractions of company s shares in hands of other companies ) .",
    "the links of spacial networks @xcite has a natural characteristic  their length .",
    "so , in this case an edge weight may be introduced as some function of the length of the corresponding edge .",
    "the simplest local characteristics of weighted networks are ( i ) the weight of an edge , @xmath0 , ( ii ) the degree of a vertex , and ( iii ) `` the strength '' of a vertex ,    @xmath1    here the sum is over the nearest neighbors of the vertex @xmath2 .",
    "( one can introduce directed weighted networks , where vertices have `` in - strength '' and `` out - strength '' . )",
    "the distributions of these local characteristics in random networks are a weight distribution @xmath3 , a degree distribution @xmath4 , and a strength distribution @xmath5 .    a number of models , which provide complex , in particular , scale - free weighted networks , were proposed ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "obviously , one may easily construct a complex weighted network independently ascribing degrees to vertices and weights to edges ( see the next section ) .",
    "for this , ( i ) build an unweighted network by any of existing algorithms and afterwords ( ii ) arrange weights of edges .",
    "these are trivial constructions .",
    "a much more interesting scale - free network model , where the evolutions of degrees and weights are coupled , was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this network , in addition to a standard preferential attachment rule @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , a specific redistribution of edge weights was introduced . in more detail , ( i )",
    "each new vertex is attached to a preferentially selected existing vertex ( the probability of the attachment is proportional to the vertex strength ) , and ( ii ) weights of connections of the latter vertex are updated in a specific way depending on the strength of the vertex .",
    "that is , in this model , a preferential attachment to a vertex induces changes in weights of its edges .",
    "this evolution results in ( a ) a power - law weight distribution , ( b ) a linear dependence of the strength of a vertex on its degree , and ( c ) power - law strength and degree distributions . note that the specific form of rule ( ii ) is necessary to obtain scale - free networks .",
    "in the present paper we show that quite similar results [ ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ] can be obtained by using a more simple construction .",
    "actually we use the same idea as in our network evolving due to attachment to the ends ( or to an end ) of a randomly chosen edge @xcite . in the present network ,",
    "the weight of a preferentially chosen edge is increased by a constant , and    its end receives a new connection of a unit weight .    one can see that this model is so simple , that it may be considered as a minimal one .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s - equilibrium ] we , for comparison , demonstrate a `` trivial '' construction of an equilibrium weighted network , which is a direct generalization of the configuration model . in sec .",
    "[ s - model ] we define our stochastic model and present its solution . in sec .",
    "[ s - how_to_choose ] we explain how one can choose edges at random or accounting for their weights . in sec .",
    "[ s - generalizations ] we describe simple generalizations of the model . in sec .",
    "[ s - deterministic ] we introduce deterministic scale - free weighted networks . in sec .",
    "[ s - applications ] we discuss possible applications of our models .",
    "as a starting point , we consider a `` trivial '' equilibrium , weighted network  the simplest generalization of the configuration model of a random network .",
    "the standard configuration model is , in simple terms , a maximally random graph with a given degree distribution , @xmath4 , see ref .",
    "@xcite , where the model was introduced in this form , and also refs .",
    "@xcite with very similar constructions .",
    "in addition , we assume that the weights of the edges in the random graph ensemble of the configuration model are random , independent , and distributed according to a given weight distribution @xmath3 .",
    "the question is : what is the resulting distribution of the vertex strength , @xmath5 , in this network ?    for brevity",
    ", in this section , we consider only networks with integer edge weights .",
    "however , the final result for the asymptotics of distributions is also valid without this assumption .",
    "actually , we must calculate the distribution of the sum of independent equally distributed random variables .",
    "the resulting relation is especially simple in a @xmath6-transformed form .",
    "let us introduce the @xmath6-transforms ( generating functions ) of the distributions @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 : @xmath7 & & \\sigma(z ) \\equiv",
    "\\sum_w z^w q(w ) \\nonumber \\\\[5pt ] & & \\psi(z ) \\equiv",
    "\\sum_s z^s r(s ) \\ , .   \\label{e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , accounting for the definition of the strength ( [ e1 ] ) and for the mutual independence of edge weights ( and vertex degrees ) , we immediately have    @xmath8    here we used a standard relation for the @xmath6-transform of the distribution of the sum of independent random variables ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the original distribution at large values of a random variable is related to the analytical structure of the corresponding @xmath6-transformation near @xmath9 .",
    "for example , for a power - law original , we have the following correspondence : @xmath10   \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\psi(z\\ \\text{near}\\ 1 ) & \\cong &   1 + \\sum_{i>0}a_i ( 1-z)^i + b(1-z)^{\\gamma_k-1 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{e4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the @xmath6-transformation of a rapidly decreasing distribution ( i.e. , with the finite moments ) , is analytical at @xmath9 .",
    "so , accounting for correspondence ( [ e4 ] ) , relation ( [ e3 ] ) leads to the following conclusions for this network :    if both the distributions @xmath4 and @xmath3 are rapidly decreasing , then the strength distribution @xmath5 is rapidly decreasing too ;    if @xmath4 is rapidly decreasing , and @xmath3 is , e.g. , a power law , @xmath11 , then the resulting strength distribution is also power - law , with the same exponent , @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 ;    if @xmath4 is , e.g. , scale - free , @xmath14 , and @xmath3 rapidly decreasing ( i.e. , @xmath15 analytic at @xmath9 ) , then @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 ;    if both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are scale - free , then the resulting distribution @xmath5 is also scale - free with exponent @xmath18 .",
    "these are important , although particular , cases .",
    "however , relation ( [ e3 ] ) allows one to easily obtain , after an inverse @xmath6-transform , a strength distribution for the weighted graph with arbitrary degree and weight distributions .",
    "note that , also , one may consider a more `` serious '' , `` non - trivial '' generalization of the configuration model .",
    "these are labeled random graphs with a given sequence of `` generalized degrees '' .",
    "the generalized degree of a vertex is a complete set of numbers , where each number shows how many edges of a given weight are attached to this vertex .",
    "this is quite similar to the constructions of graphs with hidden color of refs .",
    "let us introduce the model of a growing scale - free network in more precise terms than in the introduction .",
    "we first discuss the simplest case .",
    "we assume that the growth starts from an arbitrary configuration of vertices and edges , e.g. , from a single edge of weight @xmath19 . at each successive time step ,    choose an edge with probability proportional to its weight and increase this weight by a constant @xmath20 ,    attach a new vertex to both the ends of this edge by edges of weight @xmath19    ( see fig .  [ f3 ] ) .    in the particular case of @xmath21 , this network is reduced to our model of ref .",
    "@xcite . rule ( i ) may be interpreted in the following way .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 and the weights of the edges are integer numbers . in this case ,",
    "an edge of weight @xmath23 may be treated as a @xmath23-multiple edge .",
    "if we choose each `` elementary '' edge in this network with multiple edges at random , with equal probability , we just arrive at the proportional preferential choice of edges in the corresponding weighted network .",
    "rule ( ii ) may be easily modified : attach a new vertex to one of the ends of the selected edge and not to the both of them  see below . in the present form ,",
    "rule ( ii ) results in the following rigid coupling of the degree @xmath24 of a vertex and its strength @xmath25 :    @xmath26    indeed , in this model , each attachment to a vertex increases its degree by @xmath19 and its strength by @xmath27 ( @xmath19due to the link of weight @xmath19 to a new vertex and @xmath22 due to the modification of the selected edge ) . taking into account that new vertices have degree and strength equal to @xmath28 results in relation ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "so the degree and strength distributions have quite similar asymptotic behaviors",
    ".    we will show below that the weight distribution , the strength distribution , and the degree distribution of this network have power - law asymptotics :    @xmath29    with exponents    @xmath30   & & \\gamma_s = \\gamma_k = 1 + \\frac{2+\\delta}{1+\\delta } = 2 + \\frac{1}{1+\\delta } \\ , .",

    "we pass to the continuum @xmath34 limit and assume a stationary form of the weight distribution , @xmath40 . then , passing to the continuum limit of weight allows us to obtain a power - law form of the weight distribution @xmath11 with the @xmath41 exponent given by formula ( [ e5b ] ) .",

    "for this ,    choose a random vertex and then    subsequently choose each of its ( weighted ) edges with some sufficiently small probability proportional to its weight .",
    "then , repeat .",
    "rule ( ii ) means that , after a vertex ( say vertex @xmath2 ) is selected , each of its weighted edges is selected with probability @xmath61 . here , @xmath25 is the strength of this vertex [ see definition ( [ e1 ] ) ] and @xmath0 is the strength of an edge attached to this vertex .",
    "@xmath56 is an arbitrary parameter , so small that there is a small chance to subsequently select two or more edges attached to one vertex ( see the above procedure ) .",
    "as we promised , let us consider the variation of the model with attachment to one end vertex of a selected edge .",
    "at each successive time step ,    choose an edge with probability proportional to its weight and increase this weight by a constant @xmath20 ,    attach a new vertex to one the ends of this edge by edges of weight @xmath19    ( see fig .",

    "let us demonstrate how to construct a deterministic , scale - free , weighted , compact network by using the second approach .",
    "we will exploit the equivalent representation of integer - weighted edges as multiple connections ( see fig .  [ f6 ] ) .    as an example",
    ", we use the transformation that is a deterministic variation of the transformation shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] with an integer @xmath22 .",
    "this transformation is shown in fig .",
    "the edge of integer weight @xmath23 is transformed into the edge of weight @xmath95 with @xmath23 triangles of @xmath19-weight edges attached .",
    "the growth starts from the triangle of edges of weight @xmath19 . at each successive step , each edge of the graph is transformed in the way shown in fig .",
    "the result is a weighted pseudofractal network , shown in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] in particular case of @xmath96 . if @xmath21 , we get the deterministic graph of refs .  @xcite",
    ".    we will show below that the weight , strength , and degree distributions of this graph are power - law with exponents    @xmath97   & & \\gamma_s = \\gamma_k = 1 + \\frac{\\ln(3+\\delta)}{\\ln(2+\\delta ) } \\ , ,    \\label{e22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "note that @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "we emphasize that this is only a particular example .",
    "the readers can easily consider numerous variations : use other transformations of this kind or their combinations , transform different clusters , transform not each of given elements of a graph but only some of them , selected in a regular way , consider networks embedded in a finite dimension space , consider trees , and so on .",
    "these variations produce a wide range of network architectures and a wide range of the exponents values in the range @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider the growth of the graph .",
    "one can see that at each step of the evolution , a weight of each individual edge of the graph , a strength of each individual vertex and its degree transform in the following way :    @xmath100   & &   s\\ \\to\\ s ' = ( 2+\\delta)s \\ , ,   % % \\label{e23 } \\nonumber \\\\[5pt ]   & & k\\ \\to\\ k ' = k+s \\ , ,   \\label{e22a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively ( the indices of edges and vertices are not shown ) .",
    "we introduce the following notations for basic numbers : @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , which are the total numbers of vertices and edges and the total weight of the edges in this deterministic graph in an @xmath104th generation , respectively .",
    "the total degree is @xmath105 .",
    "the total strength of vertices is @xmath106 .    in the initial state ,",

    "new edges have weight @xmath19 , new vertices have degree and strength equal to @xmath28 .",
    "all the edges that emerge simultaneously have the same weight .",
    "all the vertices that emerge simultaneously have the same strength and the same degree .",
    "the weight @xmath111 of edges emerged @xmath112 generation ago and the strength @xmath113 and the degree @xmath114 of vertices emerged at that moment are    @xmath115   & &   s_m = 2(2+\\delta)^{m-1 } \\",
    ", ,   % % \\label{e23 } \\nonumber \\\\[5pt ]   & & k_m = \\frac{2}{1+\\delta}[(2+\\delta)^{m-1}+\\delta ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{e26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath104th generation graph contains @xmath116 new vertices and @xmath117 new edges .",
    "consequently , the @xmath104th generation graph contains @xmath118 edges of weight @xmath111 and @xmath119 vertices of strength @xmath113 and degree @xmath114 .",
    "here @xmath111 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 are given by formula ( [ e26 ] ) .",
    "as a result , we obtain a power - law behavior of the spectrum of the weight : the number of the edges of weight @xmath111 is @xmath120 .",
    "this is a discrete spectrum with gaps between discrete weights growing with @xmath23 . to present our result in a form which can be compared with results for stochastic models , where distributions are continuous and spectrum gaps are absent , we pass to the cumulative weight distribution : @xmath121 .",
    "this distribution already has no gaps like the corresponding cumulative distribution of the edge weight of stochastic networks , @xmath122 .",
    "so we arrive at formula ( [ e21 ] ) for the @xmath41 exponent of the edge - weight distribution .",
    "similarly , we obtain the power strength spectrum : the number of vertices of strength @xmath113 is @xmath123 .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the vertex strength is @xmath124 , and the corresponding cumulative continuum distribution of the vertex strength in stochastic models is @xmath125 .",
    "one can see that the degree spectrum of the deterministic graph is quite similar to the strength spectrum .",
    "so , we finally obtain formula ( [ e22 ] ) for the exponents of the strength and degree distributions .    other structural characteristics of this graph also can be easily found .",
    "we present here only an expression for the standard local degree - dependent clustering , which is defined as    @xmath126    by construction , a vertex of degree @xmath127 in this graph has @xmath128 triangles attached , so we readily find    @xmath129    note that this expression is independent of @xmath22 , and we have the same result as for the network of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we discussed networks where edges of high weight attract new connections .",
    "does this occur in the real world ? here",
    "we present only one illustration .",
    "let us consider the evolution of a weighted network of scientific coauthorships , taken in a one - mode representation .",
    "so , the vertices are authors , and the weighted edges are ( pair - wise ) coauthorships .",
    "intensive pair - wise collaborations have a greater chance to attract new collaborators than occasional connections . speaking in simple terms ,",
    "if two coauthors have only a single paper , e.g. , written 20 years ago , there is a small chance that somebody suddenly decide to write a paper with them . in contrast , fruitful joint efforts lead to new coauthorships much more frequently .",
    "one may say , it is the papers  scientific results , but not their authors that attract new coauthors .",
    "this is precisely the mechanism that is discussed in the present paper .",
    "one point should be stressed .",
    "we have shown that our approach leads to results which are close to those obtained in refs .",
    "so that , these two approaches are related . in the model of refs .",
    "@xcite , `` strong '' vertices attract new connections and afterwards the weights of the edges of these vertices are specifically modified . in contrast , in our case , links of high weight increase their weights and attract new connections .",
    "that is , in one approach , the attachment is to ( `` strong '' ) vertices and in the other approach , the attachment is to ( `` heavy '' ) edges .",
    "this is a principal difference which is related to distinct real situations .",
    "we have shown that the introduced mechanism operates in real - world networks .",
    "we have demonstrated that our approach allows one to formulate minimal , non - trivial , solvable models of evolving scale - free , weighted networks .",
    "we have found a number of basic structural characteristics of these networks .",
    "we indicated some possible generalizations .",
    "in particular , we have introduced a wide class of weighted deterministic graphs of a pseudofractal type and have considered the simplest scale - free , weighted , deterministic graph in detail .    in summary , we have developed an effective , simple approach to evolving weighted networks .",
    "this approach allows one to extend numerous results for well studied unweighted networks to a wide class of weighted networks .",
