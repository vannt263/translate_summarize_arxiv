    "@xcite ) this implies the following .",
    "[ hlgyfib ] let @xmath273 be the homotopy colimit of the functor @xmath268 .",
    "then the natural projection map @xmath274 is a homology fibration , with fiber homology equivalent to @xmath275 for any positive integer @xmath13 .",
    "notice that @xmath276 is the homotopy colimit under the geometric realization of the maps induced by the operation @xmath99 of the homotopy colimit of the contravariant functor @xmath277 which assigns to an object @xmath256 , the space of morphisms , @xmath258 .",
    "but the homotopy colimit of this functor is contractible since it is the geometric realization of a category with a terminal object ( the quillen over - category @xmath278 ) .",
    "thus @xmath276 is the homotopy colimit of contractible spaces , and hence is itself contractible .",
    "( see  @xcite for this type of argument . )",
    "thus the homotopy fiber of the map @xmath279 is homotopy equivalent to the loop space , @xmath280 .",
    "theorem  [ homology ] then follows from lemma  [ hlgyfib ] .",
    "we now address theorem  [ homotopy ] .",
    "the basis for this theorem is the following result of bdigheimer and tillmann ( @xcite , theorem  3.1 ) , which makes a clever use of the harer stability theorem @xcite .",
    "[ bodtill ] there is a homotopy equivalence , @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the symmetric group on @xmath83 letters and @xmath283 is the corresponding wreath product .",
    "we remark that in this theorem @xmath284 reflects @xmath285 for any @xmath13 , since as argued in @xcite , an easy consequence of harer s stability theorem is that the homotopy type of the plus construction of the classifying space of the stable mapping class group does not depend on how many ( fixed ) boundary components there are .    for the sake of completeness , we give a sketch of the proof of this theorem .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "the idea is to consider the central extension @xmath286 which gives rise to a map @xmath287 here @xmath288 stands for matrices having positive determinant .",
    "the map @xmath289 can be viewed as taking a representative diffeomorphism of a surface with @xmath13 marked points , @xmath290 , and considering the derivatives , @xmath291 . by fixing framings at the marked points ,",
    "these can be viewed as elements of @xmath292 .    in the mapping class group @xmath293 , the representative diffeomorphisms can permute the marked points among themselves , and therefore one has a map @xmath294 which yields a fibration sequence @xmath295    by forgetting marked points , one has a forgetful map @xmath296 so that the composite , @xmath297 is a homology isomorphism by harer s stability theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath221 induces a homology equivalence between this fibration and the trivial fibration , @xmath298 upon applying quillen s plus construction , this homology equivalence becomes a homotopy equivalence , and theorem  [ bodtill ] follows .",
    "now the classifying space @xmath299 , and the classical result of barratt - quillen - priddy is that when one takes the colimit over @xmath83 , there is a homology equivalence @xmath300 passing to the quillen plus construction we therefore have the following :    [ infinite ] there is a homotopy equivalence @xmath301    now recall madsen and weiss s theorem , proving a generalization of mumford s conjecture on the cohomology of the stable mapping class group .",
    "[ madweiss ] there is a homotopy equivalence @xmath302 of infinite loop spaces .    combining theorem  [ homology ] , corollary  [ infinite ] , and theorem  [ madweiss ] , we obtain theorem  [ homotopy ] .",
    "observe that taken together , theorems  [ homology ] and  [ homotopy ] of the last section imply the main theorem  [ main ] in the case that the the set of @xmath1-branes @xmath33 consists of only one element . in this section",
    "we consider the case when we have a finite set of @xmath1-branes @xmath33 , and we describe the necessary modifications of the arguments in the last section needed to prove theorem  [ main ] in this general setting .    in the presence of a set @xmath33 of @xmath1-branes",
    ", we define our general objects to be disjoint unions of circles and intervals , but now each interval has its boundary components labeled by @xmath1-branes .",
    "that is , we have the following definition .",
    "a @xmath33-general morphism from @xmath307 to @xmath308 is a general morphism @xmath7 from @xmath141 to @xmath143 ( in the sense of definition  [ general ] ) , together with a labeling function of its free boundary components , @xmath309 ( where @xmath310 is constant on each connected component ) such that the free boundary @xmath60 is a labeled cobordism from @xmath311 to @xmath312 by `` labeled cobordism '' we mean that the labeling functions are compatible .",
    "that is , @xmath313 is equal to the restriction of @xmath310 to the boundary , @xmath314    as we did in section 1 , we need to stratify the objects further by considering `` open boundary permutations . ''",
    "namely , we observe that if @xmath315 is a @xmath33-general morphism between @xmath316 and @xmath121 , ( i.e an open - closed , @xmath33-labeled cobordism from @xmath305 to @xmath121 ) then , as in definition [ permute ] above , @xmath7 defines an open boundary permutation @xmath317 .",
    "this allows us to define the open - closed string 2-categories @xmath318 , @xmath319 , and ultimately @xmath320 just like in section one , but the objects will now be @xmath33-general objects together with open - boundary permutations , @xmath321 .",
    "the 1-morphisms from @xmath322 to @xmath323 are @xmath33-general morphisms @xmath324 from @xmath316 to @xmath308 that pull back the open boundary permutations , @xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath3-morphisms @xmath325 are the isomorphisms @xmath326 of open - closed cobordisms as defined in definition  [ twomorph ] , with the additional requirement that they preserve the labeling functions : @xmath327 the proof of theorem  [ symmonoidal ] then gives the following generalization .      in the presence of the set @xmath33 of @xmath1-branes , theorem  [ homology ]",
    "needs the following modifications .",
    "notice first of all that the windows in a @xmath33-labeled open - closed cobordism @xmath315 ( a @xmath2-morphism in @xmath320 ) are connected components of the free boundary , and therefore are equipped with labels in @xmath33 : @xmath328 where @xmath329 is the set of free boundary components which are windows .",
    "the set @xmath330 is partitioned as @xmath331 where @xmath332 .",
    "let @xmath333 be the cardinality of the set @xmath334 the analogue of lemma  [ class ] above is the following :    [ classb ] let @xmath335 be the classifying space of the category of morphisms from the object @xmath336 in @xmath0 to the object @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath337 here the number @xmath338 is defined completely analogously to the description of @xmath339 prior to the statement of lemma  [ class ] . the group @xmath340 is the mapping class group of isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of a surface of genus @xmath21 , with @xmath338 boundary components , and @xmath341 marked points , where @xmath342 of these marked points are labeled by the element @xmath343 .",
    "these diffeomorphisms can permute these marked points , but must preserve the labelings .",
    "one then defines a contravariant functor @xmath344 from @xmath345 to spaces like what was done in section 2 .",
    "however in the presence of the set of @xmath1-branes @xmath33 we define @xmath346 to be the homotopy colimit of the map @xmath347 defined by gluing on the surface @xmath348 defined to be a morphism in @xmath349 of genus one , with exactly one window @xmath350 labeled by each element @xmath42 .",
    "see figure  [ figfive ] .",
    "now just like theorem  [ homotopy ] above is a consequence of bdigheimer and tillmann s splitting of the classifying spaces of stable mapping class groups ( theorem  3.1 of @xcite ) and madsen and weiss s theorem ( theorem  [ madweiss ] above ) the following analogue also follows from these theorems .",
