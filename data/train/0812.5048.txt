    "semiconductor quantum rings of nanometer size with both open and closed geometry are produced by several fabrication techniques including self - assembly,@xcite surface oxidation@xcite and etching techniques.@xcite open quantum rings@xcite attached to the electron reservoirs by contacts are studied in the transport measurements @xcite while closed rings are studied in context of the optical and single - electron charging properties.@xcite when placed in an external magnetic field the electron systems confined in quantum rings give rise to persistent currents which generate magnetic field on their own.@xcite the persistent currents in closed nanorings were subject of a number of theoretical papers@xcite but the experimental detection of the magnetization signal came only relatively recently , @xcite although measurements on a single mesoscopic ring have a longer @xcite history .",
    "the self - assembled rings grow in an elliptic geometry.@xcite the oxidized and etched rings may have an arbitrary shape including the circular one .",
    "nominally circular rings produced by these techniques are bound to contain defects due to interface roughness in particular .",
    "even weak defects to the circular potential should influence the properties of the electrons confined in a quantum ring due to the reentrant ground - state degeneracy appearing at the aharonov - bohm ground - state angular momentum transitions.@xcite a competition of the localization at the defects and extended electron states is likely to appear .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment generated by persistent currents should significantly depend on the form of electron localization .",
    "in particular the persistent current loops circulating around the ring can be broken by formation of localized states .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to determine the distribution of the persistent currents and the resulting magnetic properties of a few - electron system in a circular quantum ring perturbed by weak defects .",
    "electrons confined in semiconductor nanostructures exhibit strong correlated properties when the electron - electron interaction energy exceeds the single - particle quantization energies .",
    "this occurs for instance in large quantum dots @xcite containing a small number of electrons or at high magnetic field @xcite for fractional filling of the lowest landau level .",
    "favorable conditions for appearance of strong electron - electron correlation exist also in quantum rings @xcite in which the energy levels are nearly degenerate with respect to the angular momentum .",
    "this near degeneracy is a counterpart of the degeneracy of fock - darwin energy levels @xcite with the lowest landau level which occurs at high magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) in quantum dots . in circular",
    "quantum dots the ground - state of a few - electron system is an intermediate @xcite phase between the electron liquid and the electron solid with a dominant character of the latter at high magnetic fields . since in quantum rings the near degeneracy with respect to the angular momentum is observed also at zero magnetic field , the electron ( wigner ) crystal can be formed also for @xmath1 provided that the electron density is low .",
    "@xcite a natural distinction between the electron liquid and solid phases is the range of the electron - electron correlation observed in the pair - correlation function.@xcite this criterium is however of a limited use for finite systems , and in particular for few - electron quantum dots in which one can hardly speak of the long range order .",
    "a more useful criterium allowing to distinguish a quantum liquid from the quantum solid is the reaction of the system to a weak external perturbation . the electron crystal , in contrast to the electron liquid , is expected to be pinned,@xcite i.e. extracted from the internal degrees of freedom @xcite of the system to the laboratory frame , by an arbitrary weak external perturbation .",
    "in this paper we consider pinning of the electron systems by weak and short range perturbations to the circular quantum ring potential in two dimensions . due to the pinning",
    ", the electron correlation appears in a form of crystallized single - electron charge density islands occupying positions .",
    "we demonstrate that the crystallization of the electron density is occasionally prohibited by disagreement of the symmetry of the perturbed ring potential with the natural , i.e. classical,@xcite symmetry of a few - electron wigner molecule .",
    "we find that when the wigner crystallization is allowed by the symmetry , the strength of the localization of the single - electron islands strongly oscillates with the external magnetic field .",
    "the most pronounced pinning of electron densities occurs at the local smooth energy maxima of the ground - state energy that appear due to opening of avoided crossings in the energy spectra resulting of the angular momentum eigenstates mixing by the potential of the defect .",
    "we find that the crystallization of the electron density has its clear signatures in the properties of the system which are accessible to the experiment .",
    "we calculate the magnetic dipole moment produced by the persistent currents as well as the chemical potentials of the confined systems .",
    "we also consider the chemical potential of the ring confined systems .",
    "rings embedded in charge - tunable structures @xcite are occupied by subsequent electrons for gate voltages and external magnetic fields which align the chemical potential of the confined system with the fermi level of the electron reservoir .",
    "the ground - state transitions of the spatial and spin symmetry results in occurrence of cusps in the charging lines in function of the magnetic field .",
    "we show that the maximal pinning of the charge density is accompanied by replacement of the cusps by smooth extrema .",
    "we consider systems with up to @xmath2 electrons and solve the effective mass equations for the system confined within a two - dimensional plane with the external perpendicular magnetic field using an exact diagonalization approach .",
    "the calculations presented below are performed for etched ingaas / gaas quantum rings @xcite which are produced with an intentionally designed shape .",
    "we study rings with a single defect placed on a circumference of the ring as well as rings with two defects placed symmetrically with respect to the center of the ring [ see fig .",
    "the results that we obtain for symmetrically placed defects are also qualitatively relevant for self - assembled ingaas quantum rings which are known to have an elliptical confinement potential.@xcite for a single defect an appearance of @xmath3 single - electron islands is observed for any electron number . in the other case  for which the symmetry is lowered from circular to elliptic  the charge density with @xmath3 islands is only observed for @xmath4 .",
    "the elliptic potential is invariant with respect to @xmath5 operation , but for the odd @xmath3 the classical wigner molecules do not have inversion symmetry .",
    "in consequence the pinning of single - electron islands is not observed for odd @xmath3 .",
    "we determine the magnetization generated by the persistent currents.@xcite the orientation of the magnetic dipole moment generated by the currents oscillates between paramagnetic and diamagnetic with the flux of the external field . for circular",
    "quantum rings when @xmath0 increases the transitions of the dipole moment from paramagnetic to diamagnetic occurs in a continuous manner at the ground - state energy minima . on the other hand",
    "the reversals of the dipole moment from diamagnetic to paramagnetic orientation are abrupt and occur at the ground state symmetry transformations associated with the aharonov - bohm ground - state angular momentum transitions . on the contrary for systems in which the natural symmetry of the wigner molecule agrees with the symmetry of the confinement potential",
    "this dipole moment reversal is continuous .",
    "moreover , for magnetic fields corresponding to the strongest pinning the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the dipole moment are exactly equilibrated and cancel each other . in one - dimensional models @xcite the currents circulating around the ring",
    "are stopped when the pinned charge density takes the form of a wigner crystal .",
    "we find that although at the maximal charge density pinning the current loop around the ring is indeed broken , the currents are actually not stopped but form separated vortices rotating around the single - electron density islands .",
    "when the pinning of the density is absent or weak one observes concentric current loops running in opposite directions at the inner and outer edges of the ring like for an ideally circular ring .",
    "although the current distribution is very different in cases when the pinning is minimal and maximal , at the magnetic dipole reorientation in both cases the currents tend to generate magnetic fields that screen the external field within the electron charge density maxima .",
    "in both the self - assembled @xcite and the etched quantum rings@xcite the in - plane dimensions of the rings exceed several times their height ( the size in the growth direction ) .",
    "the electron - states in the growth direction can be therefore treated as frozen by the quantum size effect , which usually justifies the two - dimensional approximation in the studies of the confined systems . moreover , for rings with circumference largely exceeding the radial width of the ring , the reaction of electrons to perturbations of the confinement potential and to their mutual interaction , in most cases appears in the angular and not in the radial degree of freedom . for this reason many effects can be described within strictly one - dimensional models . however , in this paper we also describe persistent currents that circulate around the single - electron charge density islands . clearly , description of these vortices is out of the reach of the one - dimensional models .",
    "therefore , we consider a two - dimensional confinement potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the mean radius of the ring , and @xmath8 the radial width of the ring .",
    "we assume @xmath9 for which the potential is nearly a square quantum well .",
    "the parameters of the rings are adopted for the etched in@xmath10ga@xmath11as / gaas quantum rings after ref .",

    "the single - electron eigenproblem is diagonalized in a basis @xmath28 where the basis function are assumed in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the center of the gaussian , @xmath31 describes its spatial extension and the imaginary exponent introduces the magnetic translation , which ensured the gauge invariance of the basis .",

    "the mesh of 250 gaussian functions which we apply here turns out to be extremely flexible so that universally optimal non - linear parameters can be indicated",
