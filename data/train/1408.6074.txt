    "in this paper we describe some approaches to generate the representative volume elements ( rve ) in order to estimate the effective properties of composite materials within the framework of stochastic homogenization .",
    "our consideration of this problem is motivated by direct applications , namely the estimation of mechanical , thermal and electrical properties of composites reinforced by spherical inclusions , microtubes as well as inclusions of irregular shapes . our main approach to estimate these properties is based on homogenization techniques , so we need an efficient algorithm of generation of stochastic rves ; in particular it should be sufficiently fast and require minimal interaction with the user .",
    "the nature of the considered materials defines the geometries that we need to generate , namely we focus our attention on a mixture of spherical and cylindrical inclusions that are not allowed to intersect or to overlap .",
    "there has been a number of works on the rve generation for various geometries of inclusions : spheres ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ellipsoids ( @xcite  @xcite ) , `` spherocylinders '' ( cylinders with half - spheres attached to the ends ",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . the common point of all these geometries is that the relative positions of two figures is characterized by simple algebraic conditions . for the applications that interest us we would need also the inclusions of true cylindrical form , since we are going to use them as elementary `` building blocks '' for designing and optimizing more complex geometries .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to present appropriate methods of dealing with such geometries in different situations occuring in pratice , give an estimation of their efficiency and implementation details .    to generate an rve",
    "one can adapt several approaches that are more or less efficient for different geometries .",
    "the most natural and probably historically the first one is random sequential adsorption ( rsa , see for example @xcite )  random generation of the parameters of the geometry and verification if these parameters satisfy the imposed conditions , like the intersection one . in practice",
    "one considers an empty rve and starts generating the inclusions one after the other and rejecting those that do not verify the conditions .",
    "this process usually solves the problem when the volume fraction of inclusions is sufficiently small , otherwise the generation process can take a long time or even get stuck while the rve is still far from the theoretical volume fraction of inclusions .",
    "another family of approaches is inspired by molecular dynamics ( md ) : basically the generated inclusions are allowed to interact and change until the desired configuration is constructed . here , one should distinguish two qualitatively different techniques : `` event driven '' and `` time driven '' simulation . for the `` event driven '' md one is not interested in dynamics itself but",
    "only in a particular configuration when some _ event _ occurs : that can be a collision between inclusions or an interaction of an inclusion with the boundary of the considered region .",
    "for every such event , the parameters ( coordinates , velocities , angular velocities , sizes ... ) of the inclusions are updated and the process is repeated until the desired configuration is achieved .",
    "a nice description of such a process with an example of rigid disks in a plane can be found in @xcite ; because of this publication the process is often called lubachevsky  stillinger algorithm .",
    "the difference of the `` time driven '' md is that the parameters are updated at each time step .",
    "the former method is more efficient provided that there is an easy way to compute the time of the next event . in practice , however , already for simple geometric shapes like ellipsoids , it is not an easy task ( @xcite ) : one needs to predict the time of collision of moving inclusions and provide a consistent model of interaction itself . in this paper",
    ", we explain how the above mentioned methods can be adapted in order to generate the rves with cylindrical and spherical inclusions .",
    "we describe in details the random generation of non - intersecting inclusions , as well as the relaxation procedure allowing us to produce non - intersecting configurations from the intersecting ones",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the conditions of intersection of spheres with cylinders and of cylinders between themselves under convenient form for verification .",
    "this is already sufficient to implement the random generation strategy described in section [ sec : mc ] . as an alternative to this strategy in section [ sec : dynamic_geometry ] we present a relaxation procedure : we describe a model for dynamics of intersecting inclusions which is then used in the time driven md simulation .",
    "we comment on the mechanics behind this model as well as on the computational and implementation details .",
    "the short section [ sec : compare ] is devoted to comparison of these methods .",
    "we observe that for low volume fractions both strategies are acceptable , while for higher fraction ( which we may need in the applications ) only the latter one produces satisfactory results in reasonable time .",
    "we also study the dependence of time needed to generate the rve samples depending on the geometric parameters of the configuration : relative fraction of spheres and cylinders , size and number of them .",
    "in this section we describe the preliminaries related to the conditions of intersection of the geometric shapes that will be used as inclusions in the rve generation .",
    "we present these conditions in the form of small algorithms to make their implementation transparent . in each algorithm",
    "we not only detect the intersection but also specify the type of it ( notations of the form @xmath0 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the application of these algorithms is twofold : in section [ sec : mc ] we use them as a parts of rsa - type methods ( only the detection itself is important ) , but we also use them to define the md interaction laws in section [ sec : dynamic_geometry ] ( one does need to distinguish various types ) .",
    "these types of intersections will be described after each algorithm ; an illustration of each of them can also be seen in the appendix 1 ( figures [ fig : sp - cyl1 ]  [ fig : cyl - cyl9 ] ) .",
    "let us start with a simpler case of intersection of spheres with cylinders . throughout this paper",
    ", we will characterize a sphere @xmath1 by its central point @xmath2 and its radius @xmath3 , and denote it @xmath4 the parameters for a cylinder @xmath5 will be its central point @xmath6 , its radius @xmath7 and the direction of the axis of symmetry @xmath8  a vector which is not normalized and thus encodes also the information about the ( half of the)length of a the cylinder . in what follows",
    "we will use the notation @xmath9 for the aspect ratio of a cylinder @xmath10 .    to guarantee that a sphere @xmath1 does not intersect with a cylinder @xmath11",
    ", one needs to verify two conditions : that there is no intersection neither with the cylindrical ( curved ) face nor with any of the two bases ( extreme disks in the orthogonal sections ) .",
    "two important quantities in the process are @xmath12  the distance from @xmath13 to the symmetry axis of @xmath11 and @xmath14  the distance from @xmath15 to the orthogonal projection of @xmath13 to the axis , depending on them we check if @xmath13 is in the domain of intersection ( waved or dotted regions of fig [ fig : sp - cyl - inter_b ] ) ."
