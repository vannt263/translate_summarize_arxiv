    "therefore , schemes resorting to an efficient precooling to the thermal noise have been proposed to establish a stable entanglement between the mirrors of a cavity @xcite and between the two dielectric membranes suspended inside a cavity @xcite .",
    "further studies showed that the reservoir engineering technique supplies a nice idea to entangle the mechanical systems without resorting to precooling .",
    "for example , it is found that a stable entanglement between the mechanical oscillators in separated cavities @xcite and between the cavity mirror and atomic ensemble @xcite can be generated based on the cascade input - output process .",

    "<S> the generation of quantum entanglement of macroscopic or mesoscopic bodies in mechanical motion is generally bounded by the thermal fluctuation exerted by their environments . here we propose a scheme to establish stationary entanglement between two mechanically oscillating mirrors of a cavity . </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that , by applying a broadband squeezed laser acting as a squeezed - vacuum reservoir to the cavity , a stable entanglement between the mechanical mirrors can be generated . using the adiabatic elimination and master equation methods </S>",
    "<S> , we analytically find that the generated entanglement is essentially determined by the squeezing of the relative momentum of the mechanical mirrors , which is transferred from the squeezed reservoir through the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> numerical verification indicates that our scheme is within the present experimental state of the art of optomechanics . </S>"
