    "the superconductor s order parameter is a classical quantity by the virtue of being the expectation value of a field operator .",
    "therefore , the currents obtained from the order parameter must obey the classical conservation laws .",
    "these laws can be derived from the equation of motion , which for a non - relativistic theory like ours is the schrodinger equation ( or its adjoint ) : @xmath148 the conservation laws for spin - currents are obtained when the second equation is multiplied from right by @xmath149 and subtracted from the first equation multiplied from left by @xmath150 .",

    "it plays the decisive role in the spatial modulations of the order parameter .",
    "the quadratic gradient terms are pure kinetic energy and always positive .",
    "however , the rashba energy is linear in gradients , so it can be negative and stabilize a spatially inhomogeneous state of non - zero currents .",
    "the first term of the rashba energy @xmath177 can provide the maximum energy density gain proportional to @xmath178 for any local value of @xmath136 . since @xmath179 is a unit - vector ,",
    "the amount of gained energy naively depends on the magnitude of @xmath180 .",
    "however , @xmath181 implies rotations of @xmath179 along various paths through the system .",
    "assuming that @xmath136 is approximately homogeneous , a significant @xmath182 energy gain can come only from those regions of space where the vectors @xmath179 and @xmath180 do not rotate with respect to each other .",
    "the total angle of @xmath179 rotation on a closed loop @xmath183 must be quantized ( @xmath184 ) in order for the order parameter to be single - valued everywhere in space .",
    "in contrast , the vector @xmath180 always rotates by the total of @xmath185 or @xmath186 on the same loop .",
    "the @xmath186 angle is obtained whenever @xmath135 has a vortex of _ any _ non - zero `` charge '' @xmath107 inside the loop .",
    "therefore , only a single - quantized @xmath187 vortex allows the vectors @xmath179 and @xmath180 to co - rotate and yield a finite spatial average @xmath188 that can reduce @xmath182 .",
    "this analysis is illustrated in the fig.[vecvortex ] , and assumes that the loops of interest are simple closed paths without self - intersections .",
    "the second term of the rashba energy @xmath189 behaves better : @xmath190 can be large ( unlike @xmath191 ) while rotating in synchrony with @xmath179 along a current flow path .",
    "the additional factor of two and the absence of an explicit @xmath136-dependence also make @xmath192 stronger than @xmath182 .",
    "we conclude that this part of ( [ kin2 ] ) is the main agent in minimizing the ground - state energy .",
    "we should , therefore , seek order parameters with @xmath179 pointing everywhere in the same direction as @xmath193 .",
    "this creates a pattern of `` helical '' spin - currents .",
    "the simplest helical current pattern is a uniform flow of the in - plane spin that is perpendicular to the flow direction ( @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) .",
    "such a uniform flow indeed exists as a solution of the stationary schrodinger equation , which is the equation of motion in our theory .",
    "consequently , this solution satisfies the conservation laws in the bulk .",
    "however , it may not qualify as an equilibrium solution at the system boundaries , because it involves spin transport from one side of the system to another .",
    "the naive continuum limit considered here circumvents this problem by allowing plane - wave condensates of zero group velocity , which carry no currents and thus do not violate equilibrium .",
    "such condensates must occur at large momenta where the rashba spin - orbit - coupled triplet cooper pairs reach their energy minimum .",
    "it is , then , extremely plausible that the natural momentum cut - off present in lattice systems could put such states in disadvantage .",
    "our present analysis is not suited for the exploration of dynamics at cut - off scales , but we can nevertheless anticipate the existence of alternative stable lattice condensates .    our goal here will be to qualitatively reveal the possible nature of alternative condensates using the analytical continuum - limit approach , despite its limitations .",
    "an equilibrium pattern of non - zero currents must generally have current loops .",
    "finding them is complicated by the non - trivial conservation laws for spin - currents .",
    "we will thus make some approximations to qualitatively deduce the character of loop spin - currents .",
    "vortices of two - dimensional vector fields @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the polar angle , can implement any total rotation angle @xmath198 of the vector @xmath199 around a loop that encloses the singularity .",
    "however , only @xmath200 can correspond to a current field without any sources at the system boundary .",
    "also , only the @xmath200 case can describe a current field of a quantized u(1 ) vortex , @xmath201 .",
    "even if the angle @xmath202 winds by @xmath203 on the loop around the singularity , the corresponding vector field @xmath204 is still a @xmath200 vector - vortex for any @xmath107.,width=240 ]      since ( [ er2 ] ) is the main source of energy gain from having non - vanishing spin - currents , we can focus on its behavior in the well - defined limit of strong rashba spin - orbit couplings @xmath205 . the characteristic values of @xmath206 can be large in this limit , leading to rapid spatial variations of @xmath136 .",
    "we are then justified in coarse - graining the kinetic energy and currents over the small regions of space where @xmath136 rotates a full cycle while the other variables change gradually .",
    "the kinetic energy ( [ kin2 ] ) is approximately : @xmath207 while the coarse - grained currents ( [ currents2 ] ) @xmath208 obey much simpler coarse - grained conservation laws ( [ curcons3 ] ) : @xmath209 we can immediately see that @xmath210 on fairly short length - scales if we keep @xmath179 and @xmath193 parallel to each - other to minimize the rashba energy .",
    "therefore , @xmath211 should have no sources or drains .",
    "only current loops in the form of quantized vortices can make @xmath211 finite .    substituting the divergences of ( [ currents3 ] ) into ( [ curcons4 ] ) yields : @xmath212 in the ground state ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "these consequences of spin - current conservation look particularly simple in the regions far away from any vortex singularities , where the spatial variations of the order parameter magnitude @xmath173 can be neglected : @xmath214 since these conservation laws characterize the ground state , we may use them to learn a great deal about the nature of the order parameter in the helical condensate .",
    "we concluded earlier that the currents @xmath215 should have a certain vortex configuration in the equilibrium minimum - energy state .",
    "so , let us understand better the nature of vortices by looking at regions far away from vortex cores .",
    "suppose that @xmath135 winds by @xmath203 about the origin , consistent with @xmath216 of ( [ curcons6 ] ) .",
    "this makes @xmath180 tangential to the closed paths around the origin .",
    "the last equation of ( [ curcons6 ] ) then implies that @xmath217 should be aligned radially , in order to be orthogonal to @xmath191 .",
    "such a configuration of the vector field @xmath190 must have a symmetric continuous distribution of sources , which could be provided by @xmath218 in the middle equation of ( [ curcons6 ] ) .",
    "this is clearly a consequence of the finite rashba spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath219 ) , which does not conserve spin in the usual sense .",
    "we conclude that @xmath179 should keep being parallel to @xmath191 . as we explained earlier , this is possible only if the vortex `` charge '' is @xmath220 .",
    "any source of @xmath190 must be compensated by a nearby drain in order to avoid a buildup of currents that cost excessive @xmath221 kinetic energy . the @xmath190 source v.s .",
    "drain character is governed by the sign of @xmath222 , which can be either plus or minus even when @xmath187 is fixed .",
    "furthermore , every @xmath187 vortex of @xmath135 must be compensated by a nearby @xmath223 anti - vortex in order to avoid the buildup of currents that would cost a forbiddingly high @xmath224 kinetic energy .",
    "these considerations lead us to a candidate vortex lattice state shown in the fig.[helicallattice](a ) .",
    "the @xmath187 vortices should form a bipartite lattice , whose one sublattice provides sources and the other drains for @xmath190 .",
    "the plaquettes of this bipartite lattice should contain the @xmath223 anti - vortices .",
    "it should be noted that the symmetry of this abrikosov lattice naturally satisfies the conservation laws ( [ curcons5 ] ) even near vortex cores .    a very similar alternative vortex lattice , shown in fig.[helicallattice](b ) ,",
    "could be envisioned with @xmath136 having a vortex configuration just like @xmath135 ( the average @xmath136 `` vortex - charge '' density must also vanish , as required by the kinetic energy ) .",
    "this would imply @xmath225 , and the existance of sources and drains in the vector field of @xmath179 .",
    "however , such a state is not stable because it violates the last current conservation equation of ( [ curcons6 ] ) .",
    "a partial remedy could perhaps be found according to the more accurate last equation of ( [ curcons5 ] ) , but only near the ( - ) anti - vortices . related to this problem is a higher energy cost of this state ( b ) than the vortex lattice ( a ) .",
    "even though both types of vortex lattices keep @xmath226 , the @xmath136-vortices in the state ( b ) should have a large vortex `` charge '' in order to achieve the optimum values of @xmath206 in the bulk ( recall that we are considering the limit of large spin - orbit couplings ) .",
    "this is bound to produce much larger and costlier vortex cores than the ones of the state ( a ) , despite the fact that the @xmath135-vortices of both states always have the @xmath227 vortex `` charge '' .",
    "the geometry and other detailed properties of the helical triplet vortex lattice can be determined only numerically .",
    "this goes beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "here we are content with knowing that the equilibrium superconductor of the rashba - coupled cooper pair triplets is a peculiar vortex lattice of helical spin - currents .",
    "this state is periodic as each vortex is matched by an anti - vortex in the unit - cell .",
    "there are more than one topological defects in a unit - cell due to the order parameter periodicity and other restrictions that we discussed .",
    "consequently , these vortex lattices are likely more susceptible to quantum melting than the simplest hexagonal abrikosov lattice of cooper pairs in magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless , vortices and anti - vortices are kept firmly apart by the strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "their annihilation would result with the complete loss of helical spin - currents ( in equilibrium ) , and thus cost a finite energy - density .",
    "a vortex lattice of any kind can be melted by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the melting transition is generally first order since the vortex density is roughly constant .",
    "namely , the separation between topological defects is set by the external gauge field that stabilizes a vortex state , and not by the overall strength of the superconducting order parameter that is being gradually reduced on the approach to the transition .",
    "the ensuing quantum vortex liquid is an incompressible state .",
    "if interactions fail to localize particles because their density is too low , this quantum liquid will generally exhibit many - body quantum entanglement and quasiparticles that have fractional statistics and quantum numbers .",
    "the only theoretical approach capable of justifying the last extremely general claim is topological field theory .",
    "a theory of this kind has been constructed recently to describe both conventional and topological states of arbitrary spinor fields coupled to external gauge fluxes of arbitrary symmetry group and representation ( see ref . in the main article ) . applied to the triplet spinor fields ( [ op ] ) , this theory would have the imaginary - time lagrangian density @xmath228 : @xmath229 & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    ". however , this term is allowed by symmetry and becomes important in any incompressible quantum liquid .",
    "its role is then to determine the exchange statistics of excitations .",
    "it reduces to the well - known chern - simons lagrangian of ( fractional ) quantum hall states when the incompressible quantum liquids arise from abelian external gauge fields @xmath75 .",

    "given that the parent superconducting state is a lattice of vortices and anti - vortices , the related vortex liquid state is fundamentally different from any quantum ( spin ) hall state .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling violates spin - conservation and thus eliminates the quantization of the spin - hall response .",

    "<S> we can avoid a complicated calculation by relying on symmetries to construct the landau - ginzburg form of @xmath67 . </S>",

    "<S> the mass @xmath18 in ( [ gaugeth ] ) can be estimated from the curvatures of the dirac cones in arpes experiments@xcite , and it is larger than the `` spin - orbit '' mass @xmath91 by a factor of @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cyclotron energy @xmath94 is not small in quantum wells with bandgaps @xmath95 that can be engineered with a few quintuple layers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the density of `` magnetic '' su(2 ) flux quanta is @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> these estimates look promising if we compare them with typical flux - quantum densities @xmath97 ( in @xmath98 ) and cyclotron scales @xmath99 of electrons in fractional quantum hall states . </S>",
    "<S> the ti s cooper pair density is controlled by the gate voltage , and can be brought near and below @xmath100 to stabilize a _ fractional incompressible quantum liquid _ in a finite parameter range of size @xmath101 surrounding the qcp in fig.[phdiag](a ) . detecting fractional charge and statistics in the absence of magnetic fields , by shot - noise or quantum interferometry methods from fqhe experiments@xcite , would provide clear evidence of an established fractional ti in the quantum well .    without microscopic modeling and experimental data we can not rule out a possibility that singlets would condense before triplets in a particular device . but even then , a further raise of the gate voltage would eventually condense triplets . </S>",
    "<S> singlets can not completely screen out the gate from triplets because they repel each other stronger than they repel the triplets , by the pauli exclusion principle . </S>",
    "<S> future experimental probes of topological spin dynamics may be able to reveal fractional @xmath102 vortex liquids even if they coexisted with a singlet superconducting state of the @xmath103 fields ( which can not screen spin ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finding the precise nature of the fractional tis goes beyond the scope of this paper as it requires the exact diagonalization of a microscopic model . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we can illustrate their bosonic character by a simple example , such as the bosonic laughlin wavefunction @xcite of @xmath104 triplet cooper pairs @xmath58 whose coordinates are @xmath105 : @xmath106 the integer @xmath107 is even , and this abelian tr - invariant state has excitations with fractional charge @xmath108 , spin @xmath109 and spin - hall conductivity @xmath110 . since @xmath111 and @xmath112 can be calculated from ( [ lg ] ) and ( [ flux ] ) , one can find @xmath107 in any ground state and identify laughlin states by integer - valued @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions of hierarchical quantum spin - hall states can also be constructed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they all describe tr - invariant vortex liquids of spinful bosons ( with vortex density @xmath113 ) , and thus are not far from being good candidates for the fractional tis in our system . however , they are not adequate either because the @xmath52 spin component is not conserved . </S>",
    "<S> it is presently unknown how to write a proper wavefunction for a fractional ti shaped by the rashba spin - orbit coupling , but an effective field - theory description is available and points to the naturally non - abelian character of the ensuing incompressible quantum liquids . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    instead of @xmath52 , the spin quantum number in an ideal rashba - based ti is the eigenvalue of @xmath114 as evident from ( [ gaugeth ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if it were conserved , measuring its average on the fractional ti s quasiparticles in the momentum @xmath115 eigenstate would yield a fraction of @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the realistic complete spin non - conservation , manifested as a gauge symmetry violation in ( [ lg ] ) , spoils the measurements of fractional spin . </S>",
    "<S> at least there is no obstacle to observing the conserved fractional charge , so the fractional tis can exist . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional spin is a degree of freedom rather than a quantum number of quasiparticles ( which has a mixed spin and orbital character ) . </S>",
    "<S> combining an integer number of fractional quasiparticles must reconstitute a triplet cooper pair , so the quasiparticles must inherit from it a degree of freedom that transforms like spin under time - reversal and spans multiple basis states . </S>",
    "<S> its fractional quantization is guaranteed by the fundamental properties of vortex dynamics in incompressible quantum liquids , and its spin - orbit coupling may yield new topological orders not found in fqhe systems .    </S>",
