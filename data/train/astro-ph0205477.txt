    "these observations are part of a long - term study in which , through a comparison of molecular clouds across the galaxy , we aim to find the influence of a different physical environment on the properties of molecular clouds and their embedded star formation .",
    "previously , we have studied molecular clouds at galactocentric distances @xmath3  kpc ( brand & wouterloot 1994 ) and analyzed molecular cloud properties across the galaxy ( brand & wouterloot 1995 ) , using single - dish observations . using the far - infrared luminosities of iras point sources in the outer galaxy , wouterloot et al .",
    "( 1995 ) derived a slope for the imf which is _ steeper _ than that measured in the solar neighbourhood . in order to investigate this",
    "further we need to study the properties of clumps ( sizes from @xmath4  pc ) in molecular clouds in the outer galaxy , and higher - resolution observations are required .",
    "such observations are presented here .",
    "salient details of the three clouds we have observed in co(10 ) are listed in table  1 .",
    "they were originally found in a single - pointing co survey of iras sources in the outer galaxy ( wouterloot & brand 1989 ; wb89 ) . in each cloud",
    ", we mapped the region around the iras source with bima , while the whole cloud was mapped in co(10 ) ( wb89 - 85 ; nrao 12-m ) or co(21 ) ( wb89 - 380 , -437 ; kosma 3-m ) , to provide the zero - spacing baselines and mass estimates .",
    "the available data ( radio - continuum , water masers , outflows ) indicate that wb89 - 437 is the youngest star - forming region of the three , and wb89 - 85 the oldest .    rcrlll name & r & & m@xmath5 & l@xmath6 & associated radio emission + wb89- & & ( 10@xmath7  m@xmath2 ) & ( 10@xmath7  l@xmath2 ) & + 85 & 15.0 & 11.5 & 1.6 & 10 & evolved ( sh  2 - 127 ) + compact ; + & & & & & both optically visible + 380 & 16.6 & 10.3 & 3.5 & 10 & compact ; optically invisible + 437 & 16.2 & 9.1 & 0.94 & 7.1 & none . opt .",
    "visible hii region + & & & & & in same cloud ( wb89 - 436 ) +    the data were analyzed using the 3-d clump detection and analysis program clumpfind ( williams , de geus , & blitz 1994 ) .",
    "the program assigns virtually all emission in the bima maps ( above a 2.5@xmath8 threshold ) to clumps .",
    "the clump lists were trimmed to include only resolved clumps , that lie completely inside the map boundary .",
    "the physical parameters of the clumps found in the fog clouds were compared to those of clumps in two local clouds : the rosette molecular cloud ( rmc : williams , blitz , & stark 1995 , @xmath9co(10 ) at 0.8  pc resolution ; schneider et al .",
    "1998 , @xmath9co(21 ) at 0.12  pc resolution ) and orion b south ( kramer , stutzki , & winnewisser 1996 , @xmath9co(21 ) at 0.14  pc resolution ) .",
    "the original data were provided by the authors , and on both clouds we performed the same clump analysis as on the fog clouds .",
    "a simplified picture of a molecular cloud is that of an ensemble of relatively high - density clumps , moving about in a low - density ( interclump ) medium .",
    "various forces are at work on the clumps : their ( self- ) gravity and the pressure of the interclump medium try to compress the clumps , while the pressures due to turbulent and thermal motions , and due to magnetic fields work in the opposing direction . the virial theorem for a clump , with external pressure @xmath10 , can therefore be written as    @xmath11 , where the p@xmath12 includes both thermal and ( dominant ) non - thermal contributions , and with @xmath8 the 1-d velocity dispersion , @xmath13 the average mass density , and m@xmath5 , r the clump mass and radius .",
    "the ratio between turbulent and gravitational pressures is the virial parameter @xmath14 . in fig",
    ".  1 we plot @xmath14 and various pressure ratios as a function of clump mass .",
    "if a clump is in virial equilibrium with external surface pressure @xmath10=0 and in the absence of a magnetic field , the turbulent pressure is exactly balanced by the gravitational pressure , and @xmath14=1 . in both fog and local clouds the most massive clumps meet this condition ( fig .",
    "1a , b ) , while lower - mass clumps have @xmath151 and would need some external pressure to be confined . fig .",
    "1c , d shows that when the pressure - term due to the interclump medium is taken into account , virtually all clumps can be brought in or near equilibrium .",
    "in fact , for many clumps in the local clouds ( fig .  1d ) p@xmath12 is more than compensated for by the total p@xmath16 , and some stabilizing force is needed to prevent large - scale collapse .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1e , f this can be achieved by adding the magnetic field - term to the pressure equation .",
    "the field may be stronger , especially in the more massive clumps and in the local clouds , while it may be lower in the fog clouds , but already with the presently used relatively low value it is clear that the magnetic field is an important ingredient in the pressure balance .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "1a , b lower - mass clumps have @xmath151 and would need some external pressure to be confined ( fig .  1c  f ) . however , in the fog clouds there are clumps with small values for @xmath14 even down to the lowest masses : in the high - resolution rmc data the lowest - mass clump with @xmath172 has m@xmath1823.4  m@xmath2 , while this is 2.0  m@xmath2 and 4.7  m@xmath2 in wb89 - 380 and -85 , respectively , i.e. up to an order of magnitude smaller . moreover , in wb89 - 380 there are 14 clumps with m@xmath19  m@xmath2 and @xmath172 ; in wb89 - 85 there are 5 clumps that fall within these constraints . in these clumps , gravity is the dominant force balancing internal turbulence ; this implies that gravitational collapse and star formation may occur more readily even in the smallest of these outer galaxy clumps .",
    "since a clump of mass @xmath20 can only form stars of mass less than @xmath20 , this would mean that an excess of low mass stars is expected to form in the outer galaxy with respect to local clouds .",
    "this would provide an explanation for the results of those ( garmany , conti , & chiosi 1982 ; wouterloot et al .",
    "1995 ) who find that the imf steepens in the outer galaxy .",
    "do we actually find stars of m@xmath211  m@xmath2 in the far - outer galaxy , and are there more of them than what is seen locally ?",
    "there is indeed ongoing star - formation in these , and other fog clouds .",
    "brand & wouterloot ( 2002 ) have imaged 5 embedded clusters in 4 clouds in the j , h , k - bands with the eso 2.2-m telescope . an example is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the advantage of observing clusters in distant outer galaxy clouds is that that there is negligible contamination by background stars .",
    "we find stars with visual extinction a@xmath22 up to about 19 mags .",
    "the completeness limit of our data is around k@xmath23 . at a typical distance of 10  kpc and with a@xmath24  mags .",
    "this corresponds to spectral types a0v@xmath25a5v , i.e. m@xmath26  m@xmath2 ; with a@xmath27  mags .",
    "this is about b8v , or m@xmath28  m@xmath2 . to find stars of masses low enough to be formed from the clumps discussed above , i.e. @xmath29  m@xmath2 or types m0v@xmath25k0v",
    ", one needs to go down to at least k@xmath30  mags .",
    "( at 10  kpc and with a@xmath22=10 ) , which is a job for vlt / isaac .",
    "the results discussed above are necessarily derived from a rather inhomogeneous data base , where effects of resolution , sensitivity and isotopomers and transitions play a role . for a detailed discussion of the observational biases we refer to brand et al .",
    "homogeneous observations of a larger sample of outer- and inner galaxy clouds and their embedded stellar population are needed to verify if the difference in mass spectra reported here are a truly general phenomenon .      brand , j. , & wouterloot , j.g.a .",
