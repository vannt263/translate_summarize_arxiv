    "let us begin by considering de finetti s theorem .    the usual statement of de",
    "finetti s theorem is that a sequence of exchangeable random variables is necessarily a mixture of independent , identically distributed random variables .",
    "exchangeability means that , if the random variables @xmath9 take values in @xmath1 and @xmath10 is any measurable function , for @xmath11 , then @xmath12 does not depend on the values of the indices @xmath13 as long as @xmath14 are distinct . an excellent reference is @xcite , wherein the theorem is proved by showing that the extreme points must be i.i.d .  sequences and using choquet theory .",
    "another beautiful reference is @xcite , which gives a deep picture of exchangeability , as well as two different proofs ( one of which is original to aldous ) .",
    "now we will consider a different perspective .",
    "this is motivated by kingman s random partition structures , @xcite , but it is not necessary to be acquainted with those to appreciate this perspective .    consider a triangular sequence of random variables given by a sequence of measures @xmath15 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath16 is a probability measure describing the random variables @xmath17 . for @xmath18 with @xmath19 , consider the transition @xmath20 , which is uniquely defined by specifying @xmath21 for all measurable events @xmath22 , subsets of @xmath1 . in other words , if the random variables @xmath23 , are distributed according to @xmath16 , then the law of the random sequence @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 , if @xmath24 is obtained by selecting a uniform , random @xmath26-subset @xmath27 , and then shuffling by a uniform , random permutation @xmath28 .",
    "we define the sequence @xmath29 to describe an `` exchangeable triangular array '' of random variables if @xmath30 for all @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , note that in this case each @xmath16 is exchangeable in the sense that it is invariant with respect to the natural action of @xmath31 .    in this case , similarly to the case above , one can prove that each exchangeable triangular array @xmath32 can be uniquely represented as a mixture of triangular arrays of i.i.d .",
    "random variables : @xmath33\\ , p(d\\mu)\\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this holds in the same generality as the result in @xcite , and could be proved by the same technique .",
    "this version of de finetti s theorem suggests the question : `` what if , in the definition of @xmath34 , we did not shuffle by a uniform , random permutation @xmath35 ? '' a more general question is to suppose that @xmath36 is chosen by another distribution than either @xmath37 or the haar measure on @xmath31 .",
    "we will not consider the more general problem , because we believe that under reasonable conditions one will obtain exchangeable distributions , unless one takes @xmath37 as the measure on @xmath31 .",
    "let us define the transition @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 for all measurable events @xmath40 .",
    "we call a sequence of measures , @xmath15 , a thinning invariant triangular array if , for all @xmath18 with @xmath19 , it is true @xmath41 .",
    "of course , every exchangeable triangular array is also thinning invariant , but the reverse is not true .",
    "the main result is quite simple to understand , and is a very natural extension of the conclusion of de finetti s theorem . however , whereas in understanding de finetti s theorem , the basic structures to consider are measures @xmath42 ( as well as the mixtures of those , @xmath43 ) in the present context , the basic structures are borel measurable functions from @xmath44 $ ] into @xmath45 , as we will see .",
    "therefore , we will try to be careful when it comes to topology and measure theory .",
    "we consider @xmath44 $ ] as a metric space , and equip it with standard lebesgue measure .",
    "we will use the borel @xmath46-algebras for @xmath44 $ ] as well as for @xmath1 .",
    "note that since @xmath1 is compact , it is obviously separable . by the arzela - ascoli theorem ,",
    "@xmath47 is locally compact , hence it is also separable .",
    "this will be useful later .",
    "obviously @xmath45 is convex .",
    "it is compact , in the vague topology , by the banach - alaoglu theorem .",
    "in fact , this topology is also metrizable , using the riesz - markov theorem and the fact that @xmath47 is separable .",
    "this fact will also be useful later .",

    "@xmath49 $ ] .",
    "if we write such a function as @xmath50 for @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath51 , then to be borel measurable means that for any @xmath52 and any @xmath53 , the subset of @xmath44 $ ] defined as @xmath54 is a borel set .",
    "we define @xmath55,\\mathcal{c}(\\mathscr{x}))\\ , , \\ ] ] the banach space whose norm is @xmath56 more precisely , @xmath57 is defined as the norm - closure , in the set of functions @xmath48,\\mathcal{c}(\\mathscr{x}))$ ] , of all functions @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is any positive integer @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are borel measurable subsets of @xmath44 $ ] , and @xmath62 are continuous functions in @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath49 $ ] .",
    "a similar argument shows that @xmath78 is linear in @xmath79 for almost every @xmath80 .",
    "note that , since @xmath47 is separable and @xmath81 is uniformly continuous , linearity in @xmath79 can be made to hold simultaneously for all of @xmath47 , for a.e .",
    "@xmath49 $ ] , because a countable union of null sets is null . therefore , by the riesz - markov theorem , for almost every @xmath49 $ ] , we can identify a measure @xmath82 such that @xmath83 .",
    "note that , since the density @xmath78 is chosen as a borel measurable function of @xmath80 , it is clear that for any @xmath52 , the function @xmath84 is borel measurable .",
    "henceforth we will think of @xmath65 as the set of borel measurable functions from @xmath44 \\to \\mathcal{m}^+_1(\\mathscr{x})$ ] , defined for lebesgue - a.e .  @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "we write this as @xmath85 , as above .",
    "note that since the topology of @xmath45 is the vague topology , to be borel means precisely that the map defined in ( [ bor : eq ] ) is borel , for every @xmath52 .",
    "next we will endow @xmath65 with a topology .",
    "given any @xmath86 and any @xmath87 , we define the number @xmath88 this is a bilinear map on @xmath89 .",
    "it is continuous as a function on @xmath57 : in fact , since @xmath82 for almost every @xmath49 $ ] , it is clear that @xmath90 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath91 is a bounded , linear functional on @xmath57 .",
    "we define the topology of @xmath65 to be the weak topology with respect to all the maps @xmath92 , for @xmath86",
    ". it will be important to us that , with this topology , @xmath65 is compact and metrizable .",
    "the reason that @xmath65 is metrizable is just that @xmath57 is separable , as we noted above .",
    "take @xmath93 to be a countable dense subset of the unit ball in @xmath57 .",
    "then we can define a metric @xmath94 a sequence @xmath32 converges to @xmath95 in @xmath65 iff @xmath96 for every @xmath86 , and this happens iff @xmath97 .",
    "the fact that @xmath65 is compact then follows by the same argument as the banach - alaoglu theorem .",
    "we are now ready to consider the fundamental example of a thinning - invariant sequence of measures @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath87 be arbitrary .",
    "for each @xmath3 , we define a measure @xmath16 as @xmath98 where @xmath99 , which has lebesgue measure @xmath100 .",
    "this is clearly a well - defined measure , because for any @xmath101 we know that the the following function is borel measurable and bounded on @xmath44^n$ ] : @xmath102 therefore the following integral is well - defined : @xmath103^n }     \\left[\\int_{\\mathscr{x}^n } f(x_1,\\dots , x_n)\\ , \\mu(dx_1,t_1)\\cdots \\mu(dx_n , t_n)\\right]\\\\    n!\\ , \\mathbbm{1}[0<t_1<\\cdots < t_n<1]\\ , dt_1\\cdots dt_n\\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath104 can be defined by the riesz - markov theorem .",
    "the probabilistic interpretation is that @xmath105 are random variables distributed by choosing @xmath106 points independently and uniformly in @xmath44 $ ] and then sorting in order from least to greatest .",
    "conditional on the values of the @xmath107 , one considers @xmath108 to be distributed according to the conditionally independent ( but not identically distributed ) measure @xmath109 .",
    "then @xmath16 is the distribution of @xmath23 , averaged over the distribution of @xmath110 .    if one defines @xmath111 to be the distribution of @xmath110 , as described above , then clearly @xmath112^n)\\ , : \\ , n \\in { \\mathbb{n}}_+)$ ] is thinning - invariant .",
    "this is sufficient to prove that @xmath32 is thinning - invariant by construction .",
    "let @xmath32 describe a thinning - invariant , triangular array of random variables .",
    "then there exists a unique borel probability measure @xmath113 such that for each @xmath3 , @xmath114    _ remark 1 .",
    "_ we can deduce the second version of de finetti s theorem from this theorem .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 is exchangeable .",
    "then , in particular it is thinning - invariant .",
    "so there is a unique borel measure @xmath115 such that ( [ thmeq ] ) holds .",
    "but because of exchangeability , we can average over the @xmath31 orbit of @xmath116 , instead , which is just @xmath44^n$ ] .",
    "therefore , it is clear that @xmath16 is a mixture of product measures , each factor just being the average of @xmath117 . because of uniqueness of @xmath118 ,",
    "it is clear , a posteriori , that @xmath118 must have been concentrated on lebesgue - a.e .  constant functions @xmath119 .",
    "_ remark 2 .",
    "_ if one considers the simple example of @xmath120 , then this is an extreme point , corresponding to the measure - valued function @xmath121 .",
    "note that this is a continuous function of @xmath80 , with respect to the vague topology ( although nowhere continuous with respect to the total - variation norm ) .",
    "the proof follows a well - known and standard technique in probabilistic results of this kind . for example",
    ", it is the technique used by kingman to prove his representation theorem , in @xcite .",
    "the idea could be described rather briefly , as it is done , there .",
    "but we will attempt to explain every detail .",
    "there are two basic tools which we use , which are the kolmogorov extension theorem , and doob s reversed martingale convergence theorem .",
    "the kolmogorov extension theorem says that a projective family of probability measures has a unique projective limit , under certain conditions .",
    "we will use a variant of the ordinary version .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , exercise 3.1.18(iii ) for a precise statement of the usual kolmogorov extension principle , which is the reference we follow .",
    "to be projective essentially means that there is a family of probability measures @xmath122 , and a semigroup of transitions @xmath123 such that @xmath124 for all @xmath125 .",
    "we will consider the case that @xmath126 is the borel @xmath46-algebra for a product @xmath127 , for some compact metric spaces @xmath128 . in this case",
    "the map @xmath129 is the projection , @xmath130 in @xcite , the reader is led to a proof of the extension principle when all @xmath131 for a single @xmath1 .",
    "let us give a concrete method for generalizing from that case to the case where the @xmath132 s are allowed to vary .",
    "define @xmath133 , with the product topology , which is compact by tychonov s theorem .",
    "choose an @xmath134 for each @xmath3 .",
    "given @xmath135 , define @xmath136 such that , given measurable sets @xmath137 and @xmath138 for each @xmath139 , we have @xmath140 if @xmath32 is a projective system , then @xmath141 is as well , and of the form considered in @xcite .",
    "restricting attention to the @xmath46-algebra generated by cylinder sets of the form @xmath142 with @xmath137 and @xmath143 , then gives us the result we desire .",
    "it is quite likely that there is a purely topological argument , based on projective systems , that bypasses all of these technicalities , but we did not find it in the elementary textbooks we consulted .    the second tool from probability which we need is doob s reversed martingale theorem .",
    "again , the reader can consult stroock s text , @xcite , exercise 5.2.40(iii ) . given a family of decreasing @xmath46-algebra , @xmath144 , and a borel probability measure @xmath95 on @xmath145 , a sequence of random variables",
    "@xmath9 is a reversed martingale ( with respect to @xmath95 ) if @xmath146 is @xmath126-measurable and in fact @xmath147 for each @xmath106 , and if @xmath148 for all @xmath149 .",
    "note that this is the opposite of a normal martingale , hence the term reversed martingale .",
    "( of course doob also proved a convergence theorem for normal martingales . )",
    "doob s convergence theorem says that there is a @xmath95-almost surely unique limit @xmath150 , which is measurable with respect to @xmath151 , such that @xmath146 converges to @xmath150 , pointwise , @xmath95-a.s . , and that @xmath152 .",
    "in our case , we will apply this when each @xmath153 is uniformly bounded , all by the same bound , in which case it is clear that the limit also satisfies the same bound , almost surely .",
    "finally , we observe that , since a countable union of @xmath95-null sets is @xmath95-null , we can apply the convergence theorem simultaneously to a countable union of reversed martingales .",
    "we will need this generalization , when we construct a function from its moments .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 is thinning - invariant .",
    "then , for any @xmath60 , we could define a measure @xmath154 on the triangular sequence of random variables @xmath155 , as follows .",

    "then , because of thinning - invariance , if we restrict attention to @xmath162 ( with @xmath163 ) the marginal of @xmath164 is equal to @xmath165 . thus the sequence @xmath166 forms a projective sequence of probability measures . by the kolmogorov extension theorem",

    "we will provide an easy proof that the sequence @xmath446 is subadditive in the sense that if @xmath447 , and @xmath448 , then @xmath449 this is important because it allows one to deduce the existence of the pressure :    for any model as defined in section [ sec : css ] , the pressure , @xmath450 exists , possibly as @xmath451 .",
    "the corollary is a well - known consequence of subadditivity , so we will not prove it .",
    "however , we will prove that in fact the pressure is finite , as follows trivially from the gibbs variational principle .",
    "subadditivity could be proved in a number of ways .",
    "we will prove it using the gibbs variational principle .",
    "the advantage of this is to give an argument which is as close as possible to the general argument for existence of the pressure for short - ranged models on @xmath452 . in particular , we hope it will be clear exactly what relationship the present problem has to the problem of proving existence of the pressure for short - ranged models : namely , the present problem is easier .",
    "( there are aspects of statistical mechanics which are harder for long - ranged models , such as determining the correct analogue of the dobrushin - lanford - ruelle equations . )    for a reference to the gibbs variational principle , entropy , and pressure , as they relate to spin systems , consult @xcite , section ii.2 or @xcite , section iii.4 .",
    "these are the references we follow .    for any @xmath60 ,",
    "let @xmath311 , and define @xmath453 on @xmath454 as the uniform distribution : @xmath455 for all @xmath46 . given another probability measure @xmath456 on @xmath454 , the relative entropy with respect to @xmath453 is @xmath457 where we write",
    "the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath458 and @xmath459 is the continuous , concave function @xmath460 , defined by continuity at @xmath461 .",

    "then subadditivity , says that @xmath467 see lemma ii.2.1 in @xcite or theorem iii.4.2 in @xcite .",
    "it will also be important for us , as is proved in the references , that the relative entropy is concave . if @xmath468 and @xmath469 , then @xmath470    equally important is the gibbs variational principle , ( c.f . ,",
    "@xcite , ii.3.1 ) , which says that for any @xmath471 , one has @xmath472 with equality iff @xmath456 is the gibbs distribution for @xmath326 . from these facts",
    ", one can conclude that for a short - ranged hamiltonian on @xmath452 , the pressure is subadditive , modulo small errors due to surface energies .",
    "this is the usual way that one proves the existence of pressure for short - ranged models , and moreover that the pressure can be approximated in finite - volumes .",
    "c.f . , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , which all devote chapters to proving existence of the pressure for short - ranged classical spin systems .",
    "to prove subadditivity of the pressure in our case , let us suppose that @xmath473 and that @xmath456 is a probability measure on @xmath454 .",
    "for any @xmath474 , let us define a measure @xmath475 on @xmath476 by @xmath477 this is a convex combination of states .",
    "then , as long as @xmath478 , it is easily seen that @xmath479 therefore , it is obvious that @xmath480 as long as @xmath481 and @xmath482 .",

    "this shows that the pressure is bounded below , hence not @xmath451 .",
    "this result generalizes a theorem from @xcite , where existence of the pressure for mean - field models was proved by a more complicated technique using interpolation .",
    "( however , it should be noted that one of the purposes of @xcite was to show that a very important interpolation technique in the theory of spin - glasses could be applied also to non - random spin systems . )",
    "finally , we would like to say that there are models where one can calculate the pressure using ideas related to those of the present paper .",
    "for example , for the exchangeable ( in distribution ) , random spin system called the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , a simple argument resulted in an extended variational principle in @xcite .",
    "we would call this _",
    "aizenman s extended variational principle _ , which is more generally applicable than just to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model .",
    "for example , for non - random , exchangeable spin systems , aizenman s extended variational principle applies whenever the hamiltonian is a convex or concave function of the average magnetization .",
    "although for the sherrington - kirkptatick model , the euler - lagrange equations derived by the extended variational principle seem too hard to solve directly , for non - random models they are readily solved .",
    "more specifically , what is easily determined is that , while the functional to be optimized is nonlinear , it is homogeneous of degree zero , and the optimizers can be chosen to be extreme points .",
    "we plan to present a careful analysis of this point , with further applications , in another paper .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank janko gravner for the invaluable suggestion to look for applications , and for his suggestion that i consult reference @xcite .",
