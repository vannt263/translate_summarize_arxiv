    "we propose a model for the description of the disjunction of concepts by using the mathematical structure of quantum field theory . the model predicts with very great accuracy the results of an experiment published in hampton ( 1988b ) .",
    "the disjunction of concepts was studied by hampton as part of the general problem of the combination of concepts within an approach where membership is considered to be a fuzzy notion ( rosch , 1973a , b , 1975 , 1978 , 1983 ; smith & medin , 1981 ; komatsu , 1992 ) .",
    "the conjunction of concepts has been studied much more than the disjunction of the concepts ( chater , lyon & meyers , 1990 ; hampton , 1987 , 1988a , 1996 , 1997a ; osherson & smith , 1981 , 1982 ; rips , 1995 ; storms , de boeck , van mechelen & geeraerts , 1993 ; storms , de boeck , van mechelen & ruts , 1996 ; storms , de boeck , hampton & van mechelen , 1999 ) .",
    "this is the reason why we apply in aerts ( 2007b ) the same quantum field model for the description of the conjunction of concepts , and show that the quantum field model predicts with equal accuracy the results of experiments on the conjunction of concepts .",
    "the main problem of the modeling of the combination of concepts was originally put forward by osherson and smith ( 1981 ) using the example of the concepts _ pet _ and _ fish _ and their conjunction _ pet - fish_. osherson and smith observed that the item _ guppy _ is considered to be a very typical item for the conjunction _ pet - fish _ , while it is not very typical neither for the concept _ pet _ and nor for the concepts _",
    "fish_. osherson and smith showed that this effect , meanwhile refered to as the ` guppy effect ' , can not be modeled by the minimum rule of fuzzy set theory ( zadeh , 1965 ) .",
    "the ` guppy effect ' was identified and studied in many other occasions of conjunctions of concepts , and the problem of the modeling of the conjunction of concepts taking into account the guppy effect is commonly referred to as the ` pet - fish problem ' .",
    "the pet - fish problem is considered to be a fundamental problem of the modeling of the combination of concepts , and has not been solved within the existing concept theories ( osherson & smith , 1981 , 1982 ; smith & medin , 1981 ; smith & osherson , 1984 ; hampton , 1987 , 1988a , 1991 , 1993 , 1996 , 1997a , b ; smith , osherson , rips & keane , 1988 ; chater et al . , 1990 ;",
    "kunda , miller & claire , 1990 ; springer & murphy , 1992 ; rips , 1995 ; storms et al . , 1993 , 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "hampton ( 1987 , 1988a , 1991 , 1993 , 1996 , 1997a ) performed many experiments on the conjunction of concepts .",
    "apart from typicality , and the related guppy effect as observed and studied by osherson and smith ( 1981 ) , hampton studied a similar effect for the membership weights of items with respect to the conjunction of concepts .",
    "he called the guppy effect for membership weights of items ` overextension ' , i.e. an item is estimated with a greater than expected weight to be a member of the conjunction of two concepts if taken into account the membership weights of this item with respect to both concepts apart .",
    "as an example consider the concepts _ sports _ and _ games _ and the item _",
    "pool_. in an experiment in hampton ( 1988a ) subjects estimate the membership weight of the item _ pool _ for the concept _ sports _ to be 0.50 , and the membership weight of the item _ pool _ for the concept _ games _ to be 0.94 .",
    "when asked for the membership weight of the item _ pool _ for the concept _ sports and games _ the subjects estimate this membership to be 0.73 .",
    "this means that subjects find _ pool _ to be ` more strongly a member of the conjunction _ sports and games _ ' than they find it to be a member of the concept _ sports _ on its own .",
    "if one thinks intuitively of the ` logical ' meaning of a conjunction , this is a strange effect .",
    "indeed , someone who finds that _ pool _ is a _ sport _ and a _ game _ , would be expected to agree at least equally with the statement that _ pool _ is a _ sport _ if the conjunction of concept behaved in a similar way as the conjunction of logical propositions behaves .",
    "the effect of overextension is abundant for the conjunction of concepts and has been studied intensively since ( osherson & smith , 1981 , 1982 ; smith & osherson , 1984 , 1988 ; hampton , 1988a , b , 1997a , b ; storms et al .",
    ", 1993 , 1996 ; rips , 1995 ) .",
    "hampton ( 1988b ) studied the analogous effect for the disjunction of concepts , and identified a systematic underextension in this case , with however also substantial cases of overextension .",
    "consider as example the concepts _ house furnishings _ and _ furniture _ and the item _ refrigerator_. in an experiment published in hampton subjects estimated the membership weight of the item _ refrigerator _ for the concept _ house furnishings _ to be 0.9 , and the membership weight for the item _ refrigerator _ for the concept _ furniture _ to be 0.7 . however , when subjects where asked to estimate the membership weight of the item _ refrigerator _ for the disjunction _ house furnishings or furniture _ of the two concepts , the result turned out to be 0.6 .",
    "this means that subjects estimated _ refrigerator _ to be less strongly a member of the disjunction of both concepts _ house furnishings _ and _ furniture _ than they estimated _ refrigerator _ to be a member of either of the two concepts .",
    "if one thinks intuitively of the ` logical ' meaning of a disjunction , one would expect that someone who finds that _ refrigerator _ is _ house furnishings _ , would also find at least equally well that _",
    "refrigerator _ is _ house furnishing or furniture_. similarly for someone who finds that _ refrigerator _ is _",
    "furniture_.    the effect of overextension in the case of the conjunction of concepts as well as the effects of underextension and overextenstion in the case of the disjunction of concepts can be modeled in a very natural way within the quantum field model that we elaborate in the present article .",
    "it are the typical quantum effects of ` interference ' and ` superposition ' that give rise to the effects of overextension and underextension in case of the conjunction as well as in case of the disjunction of concepts .",
    "the quantum field model elaborated in this article is an extension of the quantum model that we presented in aerts ( 2007a ) .",
    "we take however an essential new step , which brings us to a quantum field model in fock space for the disjunction and also the conjunction of concepts , rather than the hilbert space quantum model that we presented in aerts ( 2007a ) .",
    "we want to explain why this extension if necessary . after working out the quantum model in hilbert space presented in aerts ( 2007a )",
    ", we contacted james hampton asking him if he still had the original test results in all its details , including the tests on the items not explicitly mentioned in hampton ( 1988b ) .",
    "we were eager to establish whether our hilbert space model was also a good predictor of the data of the items not explicitly specified in hampton s experiment . when we received the data , we started to apply the hilbert space model to the items that had not been explicitly mentioned in hampton . to our disappointement",
    "the data on some of the items did not match at all the predictions of our hilbert space model . by considering the specifics of the data on items that did not match and",
    "the data on items that did match , we understood that a next step was necessary , namely the introduction of a quantum field model in fock space .",
    "although initially reluctant to take this step , because of the mathematical and conceptual complexity of quantum field theory in fock space as compared to quantum mechanics in hilbert space , we soon recognized that this additional step introduced a wealth of new conceptual possibilities that make very much sense in relation with the cognitive phenomena we want to model .",
    "indeed , we are now convinced that quantum field theory in fock space is the proper theory to model the combination of concepts and the type of cognitive interactions that we envisaged when we introduced the quantum hilbert space description .",
    "this wealth of new conceptual possibilities makes it possible to predict not only all the data of the disjunction experiments in hampton ( 1988b ) with perfect matches  this is what we will work out in the present article  but also all the data in conjunction experiments ( hampton , 1987 , 1988a , 1991 , 1993 , 1996 , 1997a , b ; storms et al .",
    ", 1993 , 1996 , 1999 )  which is what we will work out in aerts ( 2007b )  and , more importantly , it introduces a conceptual framework for the modeling of cognitive interaction in an unexpected detailed way . in the next sections we introduce this quantum field model for cognitive interaction .",
    "the items listed in table 1 are the items of hampton s ( 1988b ) experiment that entail the biggest deviation from a classical fuzzy set model . hence , the items not listed in table 1 are the ones that in the tests showed a less big deviation from a classical fuzzy set model .",
    "as we have shown , the quantum model in hilbert space introduced in aerts ( 2007a ) for the disjunction does extremely well for the items listed in hampton , i.e. the items in table 1 , but , as we have said , it does less well for the items tested but not listed in hampton .    .@xmath0",

    ", for the considered items in tables 2 and 3 , i.e. _ magnetic compass _ , _ tuning fork _",
    ", _ pen - knife _ and _ skate board _ , both models deliver comparable matches , except of course for the one item _ pliers _",
    ", where the two identical particles model delivers a perfect match with the experimental value . for the pair of concepts _ sportswear _ and _ sports equipments _ , apart from the perfect matches for the items _ baseball bat _ , _ sailing life jacket _ and _ tennis racket _",
    ", a similar pattern exists ; for some of the remaining items one of the quantum models gives a better match , while for the other items the other quantum model gives a better match .",
    "a similar pattern repeats itself for the pair of concepts _ household appliances _ and _ kitchen utensils _ and _ fruits _ and _",
    "vegetables_.    in conclusion , we can state that both models apply and that each one does extremely well for a substantial part of the items , delivering perfect matches with the experimental values .",
    "we have also seen that both models do moderately well for a substantial group of items , and that there is a non negligible group of items where they do not well at all .",
    "the models are mostly complementary , in the sense that where the one does extremely well , the other one fails , and vice versa .",
    "it is this state of affairs which was our inspiration to propose the quantum field theoretic model that we will elaborate in the next section .",
    "we will see that the quantum field theoretic model not only produces perfect matches for almost all items , but also introduces a cognitive interaction dynamics that allows very straightforward interpretation for the tested cognitive situations .",
    "quantum field theory is amongst the most sophisticated of all physical theories . when working out the quantum model in hilbert space presented in aerts ( 2007a ) , we wondered if it would be necessary to have recourse to a field theory to resolve the encountered problem .",
    "but we also felt reluctant , most of all because we were very much aware of the complexity of quantum field theory from a mathematical point of view , but also from a conceptual point of view .",
    "however , in our search for proper models , including the one particle quantum model in aerts ( 2007a ) and the two identical particle quantum model introduced above , for example by establishing for which items and concept disjunctions the one - particle model worked well and for which items and concept disjunctions the two identical particles theory presented in this article worked well , we gradually recognized that a quantum field theoretic model would bring the solution .",
    "moreover , and reflecting on the differences in dynamical interaction offered by the one particle model and the two identical particles model , we were much surprised to observe that complicated conceptual aspects of quantum field theoretic dynamics were much in line with our intuition of how things might have happened in the minds of the tested subjects in the hampton ( 1988b ) experiment , and with the many analogous experiments on concept combinations .",
    "it dawned upon us that the interpretation of quantum field theory for physics is much less paradoxical than it had seemed to be , and that it is even quite natural for cognition .",
    "this was an equally important aspect for us turning to the development of a field theoretic model as the growing conviction of being able to find perfect matches of predictions with experiments within such a field theoretic model for cognition .",
    "there is another event that strengthens our convinction that we have found the right theory for the type of cognitive interactions taking place in the experiments of the style of hampton ( 1988b ) , but most probably also a theory for other aspects of cognitive interaction , and even possibly a theory that can be developed into a general framework for overall cognitive interaction , and if so containing an important breakthrough for modeling in cognition .",
    "once we had built the quantum field theory model , and after establishing that we could find perfect matches for almost all data in hampton , we turned to experiments on conjunctions , which are much more numerous . for these experiments , the field theoretic model produces predictions matching the experimental results even better than for the disjunction .",
    "we present this quantum field theoretic modeling for the conjunction of concepts in aerts ( 2007b ) .",
    "our belief in the field theoretic model was further strenghtened by the question :  why would cognitive interaction not be at least as complicated as , and plausibly even more complicated than elementary particle interaction , so why would it not need a theory at least equally complex and sophisticated as quantum field theory , which is the theory describing elementary particle interaction ? \"",
    "the prime aspect of quantum field theory , which makes it different , and a generalization of quantum mechanics , is that states of a quantum field do not necessarily correspond to a fixed number of quantum particles .",
    "hence , concretely , the state space of a quantum field contains states corresponding to different numbers of particles , and even superpositions of states corresponding to different numbers of particles .",
    "if the quantum field is in such a superposition , this means that the number of particles contained in this state is indeterminate .",
    "technically , the set of states of a quantum field is a fock space , which is the direct sum of tensor products of hilbert spaces , where each hilbert space is the state space of a one - particle quantum entity .",
    "hence we need , for the situation we want to consider , a fock space consisting of the direct sum of a one - particle hilbert space , and a two identical particles hilbert space , because these are the situations that are relevant to our problem .",
    "this means that we need the fock space @xmath8 which is a 6-dimensional complex vector space .",
    "vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the base vectors of the first @xmath11 in @xmath12 we need to consider and vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the base vectors of @xmath17 in @xmath12 we need to consider .",
    "hence the base of the fock space @xmath12 we consider consists of the 6 vectors @xmath18 let us now turn directly to the modeling of the situation of an item @xmath19 and its weights with respect to the disjunction of two concepts @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "each of the base vectors represents an archetypical situation that we have considered already .",
    "hence : @xmath9 represents the situation of the new ` concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 ' ; @xmath10 is the situation orthogonal to this . both @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are ` one - item ' situations , i.e. membership and non membership of one item @xmath19 with respect to the new ` concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 ' are considered .",
    "we refer to aerts ( 2007a ) for a detailed analysis of the one item situation .",
    "the four other base vectors represent ` two identical items ' situations , i.e. membership and non membership of two identical items @xmath19 are considered with respect to combinations of concepts @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath13 represents membership of both identical items @xmath19 of both concepts @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath15 represents membership of one of the identical items @xmath19 of one of the concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 and non membership of the other item @xmath19 of the other concept , and @xmath14 represents non membership of both identical items of both concepts @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "what about the base vector @xmath16 ?",
    "this vector is the famous vacuum of quantum field theory .",
    "it represents the situation of zero items .",
    "calculation of the weights indeed shows that for any vector representing item @xmath19 , the weight with respect to base vector @xmath16 is zero .",
    "the 6 base vectors we consider are often denoted in a different way in quantum field theory , namely by indicating the number of quantum particles involved . using this standard quantum field notation we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vacuum , in our case the situation with no items present to be tested , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the one - particle states , in our case the situations with one item @xmath19 to be tested , hence @xmath22 represents the situation where the one item @xmath19 is a member of the new ` concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 ' , and @xmath23 the situation where the one item @xmath19 is not a member of the new ` concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 ' .",

    "if we consider equation ( [ eq2.23 ] ) , we can see that for any item @xmath19 there are three quantum parameters that can take different values , given weights and @xmath0 of item @xmath19 with respect to concepts @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we already know quantum angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the foregoing models , i.e. the one - item model presented in aerts ( 2007a ) , and the two identical items model of the foregoing sections . in this quantum field model , too , they are the fundamental quantum parameters at the origin of the quantum effect of interference .",

    "more concretely , the subject partly makes this estimate by considering the disjunction of concept @xmath3 and concept @xmath4 as a new ` concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 ' , estimating the membership of the item with respect to this new ` concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 ' , but partly the subject also does something else . he or she considers the disjunction not as a new concept , but relates the membership weight of item with respect to concept @xmath3 or concept @xmath4 to the membership weights of item @xmath19 with respect to concept @xmath3 and the membership weight of item @xmath19 with respect to concept @xmath4 and taking into account the way in which the ` or ' relates these three membership weights .",
    "this way consists of considering two identical items @xmath19 and their membership weights with respect to both concepts @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and then making the ` yes ' decision for membership , if this ` yes ' decision for membership is made for one of the two concepts .",
    "this is the reason why this part is well modeled by the ` two - identical particle quantum model ' .",
    "before we comment in detail the content of table 4 , we introduce a graphical representation of the situation .",
    "consider the item _ mantelpiece _ for the pair of concepts _ house furnishings _ and _ furniture _ and their disjunction _ house furnishings or furniture_. in table 4 below we have presented the data for a perfect match with experimental results , with @xmath86 , and the quantum angles @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ".    in figure 3 , also below , we have represented the graph of @xmath89 of equation ( [ eq2.23 ] ) in function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the item _ mantelpiece _ , where we have chosen @xmath86 , and hence @xmath90 and @xmath91 .     and in function of the quantum angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this value of @xmath80 produces a volume under the surface equal to the volume under the horizontal plane , i.e. it is the optimum of all @xmath80 values , yielding perfect matches between theory and experiment.,width=604 ]    on the two horizontal axes in figure 3 the values of the quantum angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 are represented , and on the vertical axis the values of @xmath52 are represented .",
    "the surface visible in figure 3 represents the points @xmath92 for the item _ mantelpiece _ with respect to the pair of concepts _ house furnishings _ and _ furniture _ and their disjunction for a value of @xmath86 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath52 satisfy equation ( [ eq2.23 ] ) . the experimental value in hampton ( 1988b ) of the weight of the disjunction membership for _ mantelpiece _ is given by @xmath93 .",
    "this means that for each value of the couple @xmath94 in the horizontal plane of figure 3 where the value of @xmath52 reaches 0.75 , we have a perfect match of the value predicted by the quantum field model with the experimental value @xmath95 . in figure 4",
    "we have represented the constant value of 0.75 by a horizontal plane at a height of 0.75 parallel to the horizontal ground plane .",
    "where this horizontal plane cuts the surface , we have points with quantum angle values that yield perfect matches between the values predicted by the quantum field model and the experimental values . in figure 4 ,",
    "we have indicated one of these points  the one we have chosen in table 4  by means of a dot and its coordinate lines .",
    "it is point ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 , 0.75 ) , containing the values in table 4 for the item _ mantelpiece_.     and in function of the quantum angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the horizontal plane is a graphical representation of the membership weight measured in hampton ( 1988b ) for the item _ mantelpiece _ with respect to the disjunction of the concepts _ house furnishings _ and _ furniture_. the intersection of the surface with the plane gives the points with perfect matches between theory and experiment .",
    "the black dot represents the values chosen in table 4 for _ mantelpiece_.,width=604 ]    we can easily see in figure 4 that there are a great many other points that produce perfect matches between theory and experiment , namely all the points where the horizontal plane cuts the surface .",
    "both figure 3 and figure 4 represent the item _ mantelpiece _ for @xmath86 .",
    "let us explain why we choose @xmath86 .",
    "figure 5 represents the situations of the item _ mantelpiece _ for four other values of @xmath80 , more specifically for @xmath72 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath66 .",
    "we have also added the horizontal plane at value 0.75 , as in figure 4 .    .",
    "for @xmath72 , there are no values of the quantum angles that give rise to perfect matches between the predictions of the quantum field model and the experimental results of hampton ( 1988b ) , because the intersection between the surface and the horizontal plane is empty . for the other values of @xmath80 represented in the figures , i.e. @xmath98",
    ", @xmath99 and @xmath66 , different values of the quantum angles exist giving rise to perfect matches between the predictions of the quantum field model and the experimental results of hampton ( 1988b ) , namely the values corresponding to the points of the intersection of the surface with the horizontal plane.,width=604 ]    in figure 5 we can see that for @xmath72 there are no points in common between the surface and the horizontal plane , which means that for @xmath72 there is no perfect match between the value predicted by the quantum field model and the experimental value . for @xmath100",
    "the surface already cuts the horizontal plane at a height of 0.75 , so that points exist that give rise to perfect matches between theory and experiment for this value of @xmath80 .",
    "the same applies to @xmath99 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , we have chosen @xmath86 in table 4 , because this value results in a surface that is generally closest to the horizontal plane at a height of 0.75 .",
    "we have expressed this by comparing the volume contained under the surface with the volume contained under the horizontal plane at a height of 0.75 , and choosing the value of @xmath80 such that these two volumes are as close as possible or even equal in size .",
    "the size of the volume under the surface is given by @xmath101 where @xmath64 is given by equation ( [ eq2.23 ] ) .",
    "the size of the volume under the horizontal plane at 0.75 is given by @xmath102 for @xmath86 we have @xmath103 which shows that for this value of @xmath80 the two volumes are equal in size .",
    "let us work out one more example in detail .",
    "consider the item _ keep fit _ in relation to the concepts _ hobbies _ and _ games _ and their disjunction _ hobbies or games_. for the experimental membership weight for the disjunction of this item , hampton ( 1988b ) measured @xmath104 . in figure 6",
    "we have represented the situations as described by the quantum field model for four different values of @xmath80 .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath72 we can see in figure 6 that no perfect match is possible between the quantum field membership weight @xmath105 and the experimental membership weight @xmath106 . indeed , the surface does not cut the horizontal plane at 0.95 .     and @xmath66 .",
    "hence a perfect match between theory and experiment can be obtained only by applying the genuine quantum field model for modeling , i.e. for values of @xmath80 different from 0 and 1.,width=604 ]    for @xmath107 the surface cuts the plane along two lines .",
    "hence for this value of @xmath80 all the points of the lines give rise to values with perfect matches between theory and experiment .",
    "also for @xmath108 the surface cuts the plane along two lines , so that for this value of @xmath80 these points give rise to values with perfect matches between theory and experiment as well . for @xmath66 the surface does not cut the horizontal plane , so that for this value no perfect match between theory and experiment is possible .",
    "the volume contained under the horizontal plane at a height of 0.95 is given by @xmath109 for @xmath110 we find that the volume under the surface is given by @xmath111 which is the reason why we have chosen @xmath112 for the item _ keep fit _ in table 4 .",
    "figure 7 provides a graphical representation of this situation .     and in function of the quantum angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this value of @xmath80 produces a volume under the surface equal to the volume under the horizontal plane , i.e. it is the optimum of all @xmath80 values , giving rise to perfect matches between theory and experiment.,width=604 ]    for the items _ window seat _ , _ painting _ , _ light fixture _ , _ kitchen count _ , _ bath tub _ , _ rug _ , _ space rack _ , _ bar _ , _ lamp _ , _ wall mirror _ and _ sculpture _ , the values of @xmath80 are likewise chosen in such a way as to achieve that the volumes contained under the corresponding horizontal plane and the surface differ as little as possible in size .",
    "all these items require a value of @xmath80 different from 0 and different from 1 , which means that for matches between theory and experiment to be perfect the genuine quantum field model should be used in these situation .",
    "for the items _ desk chair _ , _ ashtray _ , _ door bell _ , _ hammock _ , _ refrigerator _ , _ waste paper basket _ and _ sink unit _ , the difference in size between the two volumes is least if @xmath113 .",
    "this means that for these items a description with a perfect match between theory and experiment can be reached by applying the ` one - item quantum model ' .    for the concepts _ house furnishings _ and",
    "_ furniture _ we have two of 24 items that yield no perfect match , not even if we use the quantum field model .",
    "these are the items _ wall hangings _ and _ park bench_. for _ wall hangings _ the best approximation between theory and experiment is reached for @xmath72 , where the difference is 0.02 , while for _ park bench _ the best approximation between theory and experiment is reached for @xmath66 , where the difference is 0.03 . for the item _ shelves",
    "_ only @xmath72 produces a perfect match between theory and experiment .",
    "hence for _ shelves _ subjects did not consider _ house furnishings _ or _ furniture _ to be a new ` concept _ house furnishings or furniture _ ' and evaluated the membership weight of _ shelves _ with respect to this new concept .",
    "rather , in this case , subjects must have reasoned along the following lines :  since with a weight equal to 1 , _ shelves _ are a member of _ furniture _ , they are also , with a weight equal to 1 , a member of _ house furnishings or furniture_. \"    there is one item , namely _ wall mirror _ , for which no perfect match exists if @xmath72 or @xmath66 , which means that the intrinsic nature of the quantum field model is needed to obtain a perfect match between theory and experiment for this item .",
    "hence the state @xmath83 of equation ( [ eq2.4 ] ) for _ wall mirror _ must be a genuine superposition state of the ` one - item model ' and the ` two identical items model ' .",
    "this means that subjects partly decided to take into consideration the new ` concept _ house furnishings or furniture _ ' , and estimated the membership weights of _ wall mirror _ with respect to this new concept .",
    "this is the reason why subjects decided that , although the item has membership weight equal to 1 with respect to the concept _ furniture _ , the membership weight with respect to the new ` concept _ house furnishings or furniture _ ' is less than 1 , namely 0.95 . however , 0.95 is too close to 1 for the ` one - item model ' alone to be able to model the situation with a perfect match .",
    "that is why we need the full quantum field model . interpreting this",
    ", we find that subjects also partly considered the situation neglecting the new concept _ house furnishings or furniture _ and deciding that since _ wall mirror _ has a membership equal to 1 with respect to _ furniture _ , it also has a membership weight equal to 1 for _ house furnishings or furniture_. the fact that the experimental value is not 1 but 0.95 , indicates that this represents only part of the reasoning of the subjects , the other part being that the subjects took into consideration the new  concept _ house furnishings or furniture_.         + & @xmath0 & @xmath1 & @xmath2

    "this brings us to the last pair of concepts , _ fruits _ and _ vegetables_. here we have 21 of the 24 items with a perfect match , and three items for which the quantum field model does not produce a perfect match .",
    "one of them , _ mushroom _ , produces a close match ( difference of 0.05355339 ) , and two , _ broccoli _ and _ coconut _ , produce no close matches ( differences of 0.2763932 and 0.22613872 , respectively ) . for nine items ,",
    "_ parsley _ , _ chili pepper _ , _ root ginger _ , _ acorn _ , _ rice _ , _ wheat _ , _ peanut _ , _ garlic _ and _ almond _ , we have @xmath66 , so that they fit in the ` one - item situation ' with consideration of the new ` concept _ fruits or vegetables _ ' . for two items , _ apple _ and _ pumpkin _ , we have @xmath72 , so that this item fits within the ` two identical items situation ' , neglecting the new concept _ fruits or vegetables_.    for ten items , _ olive _ , _ raisin _ , _ mustard _ , _ tomato _ , _ green pepper _ , _ watercress _ , _ black pepper _ , _ yam _ , _ elderberry _ and _ lentils _ , we have @xmath80 different from 1 and different from 0 , which means that these items need a genuine quantum field theoretic modeling , and a situation which is a superposition between the ` one - item ' and ` two identical items ' situations .",
    "there are two items , _ raisin _ and _ elderberry _ , for which a perfect match between theory and experiment does not exist if @xmath72 or @xmath66 , which means that only within the quantum field model a solution for a perfect match exists .",
    "we now have all the necessary data and values to calculate the vector expressed in the canonical base of fock space representing the states of the considered items .",
    "hence , let us calculate @xmath83 expressed in function of the canonical base @xmath116 of fock space . from ( [ eq2.11 ] ) , ( [ eq2.12 ] ) , ( [ eq2.13 ] ) , ( [ eq2.14 ] ) and ( [ eq2.15 ] ) it follows that @xmath117 which gives us the following expression for @xmath83 in function of the canonical base of fock space @xmath118 let us calculate this vector explicitly for the item _ mantelpiece _ with respect to the pair of concepts _ house furnishings _ and _",
    "furniture_. for mantelpiece we have @xmath119 , and hence @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and hence @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and hence @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , and hence @xmath126 .",
    "we have @xmath86 and @xmath127 , which gives @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we have @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "let us choose @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . using ( [ eq2.8 ] ) and ( [ eq2.9 ] ) , we get @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "this gives us @xmath138 hence we have @xmath139 this is the vector representing the item _ mantelpiece _ in the 6-dimensional complex hilbert space which is the fock space of the field theoretic model that we introduced .",
    "observe that some of the components of the vector are complex numbers .",
    "we introduced a quantum field model for the description of the disjunction of two concepts that is able to predict with very great accuracy the outcomes of experiments that measure the membership weight of items with respect to the disjunction of two concepts in function of the membership weight of these items with respect to each of the concepts apart .",
    "the predictions are made using formula ( [ eq2.23 ] ) , where the membership weight @xmath52 of an item with respect to the disjunction of concept @xmath3 and concept @xmath4 is given in function of the membership weights @xmath53 and @xmath54 of this item with respect to concept @xmath3 and concept @xmath4 .",
    "the angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the quantum angles characterizing the specific item and introduce the quantum effect of interference giving rise to the exact deviations from a classical interpretation of the disjunction as measured in an experiment performed by hampton ( 1988b ) .    these deviations , which hampton ( 1988b ) called overextension and underextension , are similar to the well - known deviations from a classical interpretation measured in the case of the conjunction of two concepts , an effect often referred to as the guppy effect and a situation often referred to as the pet - fish problem .",
    "hence , according to our quantum field model , the effects of overextension and underextension are due to cognitive interference and can be modeled to a very great accuracy by our quantum field theoretic model .",
    "next to these very accurate predictions obtained by the quantum field model , the quantum field model also introduces a dynamics for situations encountered in the experiment .",
    "the quantum field model that we introduced consists of two sub models .",
    "one of the sub models is a ` one - item model ' and the other sub model is a ` two identical items model ' .",
    "the complete quantum field model consists of a superposition of these two sub models .",
    "the sub model which is the ` one - item model ' describes the following aspect : the item in question is compared with a new concept whose vector state is mathematically the superposition of the vector states representing the two considered concepts .",
    "this new concept is the concept @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the other sub model , the ` two identical items model ' , describes the following aspect : the item in question is compared with concept @xmath3 and with concept @xmath4 and a decision about membership weight in relation with the disjunction of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is taken depending on the decision about membership weight in relation to concept @xmath3 and concept @xmath4 apart , and making use of a quantum version of the ` or ' , hence ` yes ' for membership of the disjunction follows from ` yes ' for membership of one of the concepts @xmath3 or @xmath4 .    in this article",
    "we only treat the situation of the disjunction of concepts .",
    "the theory s full power shows when we use it also for the modeling of the situation of the conjunction of concepts ( aerts 2007b ) and for the elaboration of a fundamental mechanism for the formation of concepts ( aerts 2007c ) .",
