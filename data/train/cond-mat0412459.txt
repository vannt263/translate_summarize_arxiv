    "it is appreciated that in most cases the flow ( or counterflow ) of heii occurs in the presence of a chaotic set of vortex filaments , the so called superfluid turbulence . to describe various problems both for applications and for experiments",
    "it is necessary to use equations of hst .",
    "these equations unify classical equations of hydrodynamics of heii and the famous vinen equation describing the dynamics of the vortex tangle .",
    "the hst was widely used to describe various hydrodynamics as well as thermal phenomena in heii in presence of vortex tangle ( see the review paper @xcite ) .",
    "the set of hst equations is extremely cumbersome , therefore , there is no wonder that to achieve quantitative results one is bound to turn to numerical methods . yet",
    ", numerical simulation of nonstationary flows of heii faces one serious obstacle .",
    "the point here is that slow variation of hydrodynamic variables is accompanied by the fast processes related to propagation of the first and second sounds .",
    "if one is interested in the slow evolution , particular details of sound propagation become completely irrelevant , yet requiring rather extensive numerical resources .",
    "thus , it seems attractive to try to get rid of the fast modes by a pure analytical procedure . in the present paper",
    "we realize effective separation of the slow from the fast modes using multi - time asymptotic perturbation techniques ( see , for example , book by nayfeh @xcite ) . that is quite universal powereful method , its application",
    ", however , depends on concrete statement of the problem . in the present work we consider two particular examples . in the first example",
    "we follow how the initially hyperbolic - type equations of hst ( describing wave type of heat transfer ) lead to purely parabolic - type nonlinear heat transfer equations .",
    "another example of the method is the study of unsteady processes in the second sound resonator .",
    "let us consider the problem of one - dimensional heat exchange in the tube filled by heii .",
    "we assume that a heater is switched instantly on and the thermal front starts out propagating into undisturbed bulk of helium .",
    "initially , of course , the propagation of the heat should be realized by the second sound mechanism .",
    "but gradually , due to quantum vorticity the second sound attenuates and degenerates .",
    "the mechanism of the heat exchange should change . in order to ascertain both this new mechanism and the correspondent law we apply multi - time asymptotic perturbation techniques .",
    "the set of equations of hst for dimensionless velocity of the normal component @xmath0 , dimensionless temperature @xmath1 and dimensionless square root of the vortex line density ( vld ) @xmath2 ( for details and notations see the review article of nemirovskii and fiszdon @xcite ) is reduced to the form :    @xmath3    @xmath4    with the following dimensionless variables : @xmath5    it is easy to see that the dynamics of the hydrodynamic variables is specified by the dimensionless criterion the strouhal number @xmath6 , ( @xmath7-length of channel , @xmath8 decrement of attenuation of counterflow due to vortices ) .",
    "the strouhal number is defined as the ratio of the counterflow decrement to inverse time that takes the heat pulse to cross the channel . in the case of heat load of moderate intensity , of order of a few @xmath9 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is of order of @xmath11 , i.e. much greater than unity .    for times of order @xmath12 the heat pulse propagates according to wave - like equation .",
    "our goal now is to clarify what will happen at later times . for that purpose",
    "we have to eliminate the fast processes . according general ideas of multi - scale asymptotic perturbation theory ( see e.g.nayfeh @xcite ) we look for a solution to the set of the hst equations ( [ v])-([g ] ) in the form of an asymptotic series . following this method , we introduce different time scales .",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "we look for a solution to the set of the hst equations ( [ v])-([g ] ) in the form of an asymptotic series @xmath15 and similarly to @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "the simple rule takes place : @xmath17 the next step in study of the slow evolution of the heat pulse consists in substituting the multi - time scale series into equations of hst ( [ v ] ) -([g ] ) .",
    "gathering terms of the same order of magnitude with respect to @xmath18 we come up with a chain of equations leading to divergent ( secular ) solutions . cancelling step by step these secularities",
    "we then obtain a hierarchy of equations of different orders in parameter @xmath19 , governing different stages of the evolution . omitting details of computations we concentrate on the first order in @xmath20 . in the first order , equations for normal velocity and temperature variations",
    "read    @xmath21    excluding quantity @xmath22 from the set of equations written above we obtain @xmath23    relation ( [ dr ] ) coincides with the widely used nonlinear heat - conductivity equation derived by dresner @xcite by a pure phenomenological model .",
    "we stress , that unlike the dresner derivation , our work shows that this relation is just the long - time asymptotic limit of the full set of equations of hst .",
    "the second problem which we study with use of multi - scale asymptotic perturbation techniques is scrutinizing a very popular experimental method : measuring vortex line density with a second sound resonator .",
    "although that method is standard and used in many works , we , for the sake of definiteness , will consider the recent experiments made by hilton and van sciver @xcite , they performed direct measurements of quantum turbulence induced by second sound shock pulses in a wide channel . in fig.1a .",
    "there is depicted the excess attenuation of second sound in the resonator placed across the channel , along which the intense thermal pulse is propagating .",
    "it was assumed that thermal pulse created the quantum turbulence which lead to the excess attenuation of second sound .",
    "assuming further that the the excess attenuation @xmath24 is connected with the amplitude of resonance wave @xmath25 by the well - known hall - vinen relation @xmath26 , and  expressing  @xmath27 via the vld @xmath28 the authors drew a conclusion about the vld evolution , coinciding ( up to factor ) with the curve depicted in fig.1a .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that this evolution looks to be quite unreasonable . indeed , according to current view on vld dynamics , the quantity @xmath28 should grow only in presence of relative velocity .",
    "but the pulse duration was @xmath29 , whereas @xmath28 increases during @xmath30 .",
    "the origin of that discrepancy is obvious .",
    "the hall - vinen relation based on the quality factor is valid only for very slowly changing external conditions ( duration of thermal pulse ) in comparison with the time constant of the resonator . here",
    "the condition was inverted and the hall - vinen relation was inapplicable ; i.e. the amplitude @xmath25 evolved independently from the quality factor evolution . in other words the curve depicted in fig.1 .",
    "demonstrates reaction of the resonator rather than the true behavior of vld @xmath28 .",
    "thus the direct procedure of measuring of vld based on the quality factor is not correct and the question appears whether it is possible at all to extract information about vld @xmath28 evolution .",
    "the answer is positive and corresponding analysis is based on the general topic of our work i.e. on the fact that excess attenuation of the second sound due to quantum turbulence changes slower than duration of main thermal pulse",
    ". then we are in position to apply the multi - scale asymptotic perturbation techniques .",
    "let us describe very briefly the corresponding computations . taking the spacial fourier transform to eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) we arrive at the following equation for variations of the temperature @xmath1 in the standing second sound wave    @xmath31    here @xmath32 is the pumping amplitude , @xmath33 @xmath34is the resonance frequency of standing wave , @xmath35is @xmath36 the attenuation @xmath34coefficient consisting of background part @xmath37  due to background vorticity and variable part @xmath38due to passing thermal pulse .",
    "the latter  depends on the slow time @xmath39 where @xmath18 is small parameter , characterizing , say , attenuation coefficient / frequency .",
    "the corresponding analysis demonstrates that the solution is ( as usual ) a combination of general and particular solution .",
    "the general solution is just natural oscillations , attenuating proportional to + @xmath40 $ ] . as for particular solution , we seek it in a form : @xmath41\\eta + h(\\xi , \\epsilon ) \\label{eta_eq_1}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ eta_eq_1 ] ) into ( [ nayfeheq ] ) and comparing coefficients near @xmath42 and @xmath43 we obtain relations for @xmath16 and @xmath44 . representing , further , quantities @xmath16 and @xmath44 in form of series in @xmath18 , and equating coefficient near the same powers of @xmath18 we obtain recurrent equations for successive determination of both @xmath45 and @xmath46 . restricting ourseves to the first order we obtain the following equation to determine the complex amplitude of particular solution , which is just time dependent amplitude in a resonator measured in experiment @xcite",
    "@xmath47    it is seen that amplitude of second sound wave in resonator is equal to the pumping amplitude multiplied by the quality factor only in limit of very long time .",
    "generally that amplitude obeys a more complicated law .",
    "let us discuss how to extract the information concerning true behavior of vortex line density .",
    "here we have performed the following procedure .",
    "we supposed that the vinen equation for evolution of vld can be indeed extrapolated to very high value of applied counterflow velocity .",
    "then we varied coefficients @xmath48and @xmath49 of that equation in order to select best values to fit the curve depicted in curve of fig.1a . in fig.1b .",
    "is a curve which corresponds to values @xmath50",
    "@xmath51and @xmath52 @xmath53 , where @xmath51and @xmath54 are values offered by vinen .",
    "evolution of the vld corresponding to these values is depicted in fig.2 .",
    "by use of multi - scale perturbation analysis it has been shown how the wave - like behavior of the heat pulse described by initially hyperbolic equations gives way to the parabolic - type non - linear heat conductivity equation . by the similar method",
