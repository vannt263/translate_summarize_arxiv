    "asteroseismology is at present being developed as an efficient instrument in the study of stellar interiors and evolution .",
    "pulsational frequencies are the most important asteroseismic observational inputs .",
    "it is evident that a meaningful analysis of the observation , in terms of the basic physics of stellar interiors which is the ultimate target of the investigation , requires reliable computation of oscillation frequencies for specified physics .",
    "this is a two - step process , involving first the computation of stellar evolutionary models and secondly the computation of frequencies for the resulting models .",
    "lebreton et al .",
    "( this volume ) provide an overview of the tests of stellar model calculations . here",
    "we consider the computation of the oscillation frequencies .",
    "an evident goal is that the computed frequencies , for a given model , should have errors well below the observational error , which in the case of the corot mission is expected to be below 0.1@xmath1hz @xcite . for the kepler mission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with expected launch in early 2009 , selected stars may be observed continuously for several years and errors as low as @xmath2hz may be reachable , particularly for modes excited by the heat - engine mechanism . since errors resulting from numerical problems",
    "are typically highly systematic , they may affect the asteroseismic inferences even if they are substantially below the random errors in the observed frequencies .",
    "this must be kept in mind in the assessment of the estimates of the numerical errors .    during the last decades a lot of codes obtaining numerical solutions of an adiabatic system of differential equations describing stellar oscillations",
    "have been developed . in order to ascertain whether any possible difference in the description of the same observational data by different numerical codes is due to physical descriptions or to different numerical integration schemes ,",
    "the inter - comparison of these oscillation codes in a fixed and homogeneous framework is absolutely necessary .",
    "some effort has been already done in the past but only regarding pairs of codes .",
    "some codes have also developed a lot of internal precision tests .",
    "however , there is a lack of inter - comparison of a large enough set of codes .",
    "we aim in this study try to fix a set of minimum requirements for a code to be sure that any difference found is only due to a different physical assumption .    ideally , for a given model there should be a set of ` true ' frequencies with which the results of the different codes could be compared .",
    "this ideal situation could probably be approximated by considering polytropic models for which it is relatively straightforward to calculate the equilibrium structure with essentially arbitrary accuracy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice ,",
    "the situation for realistic stellar models is more complex .",
    "owing to the complexity of the stellar evolution calculation the models are often available on a numerical mesh which is not obviously adequate for the pulsation calculation .",
    "the effect of this on the frequency computation depends on the detailed formulation of the equations in the pulsation codes .",
    "these formulations are equivalent only if the equilibrium model satisfies the ` dynamical ' equations of stellar structure , i.e. , the mass equation and the equation of hydrostatic support , and this is obviously not exactly true for a model computed on a finite ( possibly even relatively sparse ) mesh .",
    "one might define a consistent set of frequencies for a given model by interpolating it onto a very dense mesh and resetting it to ensure that the relevant equations of stellar structure are satisfied .",
    "the model is fully characterized by the dependence on distance @xmath3 to the centre of density @xmath4 and the adiabatic exponent @xmath5 , @xmath6 being pressure and the derivative being at constant specific entropy .",
    "thus one could interpolate @xmath7 and @xmath8 to a fine mesh , and recompute the mass distribution and pressure by integrating the mass equation and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "frequencies of this model should then be essentially independent of the formulation of the oscillation equation and would provide a suitable reference with which to compare other frequency calculations .",
    "such a test may be carried out at a later stage in the esta effort .    in task  2 , for now , we aim at testing , comparing and optimizing the seismic codes used to calculate the oscillations of existing models of different types of stars . in order to do",
    "so we consider steps in the comparison by addressing some of the most relevant items that must be compared regarding the seismic characterization of the models :    * step 1 : comparison of the frequencies from different seismic codes for the same model . * step 2 : comparison of the frequencies from the same seismic code for different models of the same stellar case provided by different equilibrium codes",
    "* step 3 : comparison of the frequencies for specific pulsators .",
    "the work presented here is mostly focused on step  1 . at this step three",
    "different equilibrium models have been used .",
    "two of them have been computed using cesam  @xcite , with 902 and 2172 mesh points , and a third one with 4042 mesh points provided by astec  @xcite.we present inter - comparisons using the two models with the larger numbers of mesh points .",
    "the same physics and physical constants ( except @xmath0 ) are used for all the oscillation codes .",
    "frequencies in the range of @xmath9 \\,\\mu$]hz , belonging to spherical degrees @xmath10 and 3 have been calculated , in order to recover most of the possible values we can find in the observational photometric data .",
    "we present in sect .",
    "2 the equilibrium models used and we analyze their main features .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the different oscillation codes used , discussing common requirements and variations in the treatment . in sect .",
    "4 the direct comparison of frequencies for different frequency ranges and spherical degrees is presented in detail . sections 5 and 6",
    "analyze the same inter - comparison for the values of the large and small separations , respectively .",
    "section 7 discusses the dominant effects that contribute to the differences in frequencies determined by the different codes .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "to ensure that any difference obtained in the inter - comparisons is only due to differences in the numerical schemes , we imposed to all the codes the use of the same equilibrium models .",
    "these models were supplied in several formats : osc , fgong , srox , and famdl .",
    "the first model was required to have 900 mesh points , and it was provided by cesam .",
    "the differences in this case reached unacceptable values of 2 - 3 @xmath1hz when the same integration schemes are compared , and even 10 @xmath1hz when the use or not of the richardson extrapolation are compared .",
    "the maximum difference found for large separations with this model is @xmath11hz .",
    "this showed that either a larger number of mesh points or richardson extrapolation was necessary .",

    "it is interesting to point out that we can not directly distinguish between a fourth - order integration scheme solution ( oscrox ) or a second - order plus richardson extrapolation ( the rest ) .",
    "however , it is noticeable that the graco - oscrox - posc  fall in one group and adipls - nosc  in a second , with a slight difference in the latter case .",
    "these two groups are distinguished by the value of @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] ) , with adipls  and nosc  having similar but not identical values . this pattern will be found in other cases also .",

    "we have changed only one of these  degrees of freedom \" at a time , keeping the rest unchanged ( solutions @xmath39 ) .",
    "the most prominent effect arises from the use of richardson extrapolation , which changes the frequencies by nearly @xmath40hz for the highest - order modes , substantially more than the expected observational accuracies . for model m2k ( see fig . [ fig:3 ] ) , we have similarly found a change of @xmath34hz , reflecting the smaller number of mesh points .",
    "this clearly shows that second - order schemes are inadequate , even for the mesh in m4k , for the computation of high - order acoustic modes ; as expected the effect decreases rapidly with decreasing mode order . the use of @xmath25 as integration variable provides small differences , always lower than @xmath41hz .",
    "these differences are of the order of those obtained in the top and middle panels .",
    "the use of the lagrangian perturbation to the pressure as variable ( @xmath24 ) or the use of the lawe differential equation provide very similar differences , lower than @xmath42hz , but with an oscillatory pattern .",
    "this pattern is very similar to that observed for losc , which also uses lawe to obtain the radial modes . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : dep ] , this oscillatory pattern arises from an inconsistency in the thermodynamics of model m4k which affects @xmath18 ; solutions of equations that do not depend on @xmath18 ( i.e. , the lawe or the equations based on @xmath24 ) are insensitive to this effect . therefore , even for model m4k and radial modes , the use of different integration procedures can give different values for the oscillation eigenfrequencies that are non - physical in nature .",
    "these non - physical sources of differences are mainly some inconsistencies in the equilibrium models ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : dep ] ) and the lack of mesh points .",
    "but when the same numerical schemes are used , the different codes provide very similar frequencies .      to illustrate the differences appearing in the case of non - radial modes , the spherical degree @xmath43 has been chosen .",
    "we have divided the frequency spectrum into three regions : 1 ) large frequencies ( @xmath44 \\,\\mu$]hz ) , 2 ) frequencies around the fundamental radial mode ( [ 80,500 ] @xmath1hz ) , and 3 ) low - frequency region ( @xmath45 \\,\\mu$]hz ) . in all cases",
    "a study similar to that developed in the radial case has been carried out .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "the high - frequency differences are not represented since the results are very similar to those presented for the radial case .",
    "only a slightly higher precision is found in this case .",
    "the results of losc  present the same pattern as the radial case , owing to the use of @xmath24 as eigenfunction in that code ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : dep ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows the results obtained for model m2k when comparing @xmath43 frequencies around the fundamental radial mode .",
    "the main differences are smaller than in the high - frequency region , corresponding to the low order of the modes and the consequent lesser sensitivity to the number of mesh points .",
    "the largest differences are found for two modes of frequency near @xmath46 and @xmath47hz showing avoided crossing ; these modes have a mixed character , with fairly substantial amplitude in the @xmath1-gradient zone .",
    "pulse  and losc  present differences around @xmath48hz , posc  around @xmath49hz , oscrox  less than @xmath50hz , and the rest do not present significant differences for these two modes .",
    "that is , the largest differences are found in these codes when using a fourth - order integration scheme or a second - order plus richardson extrapolation .",
    "the values of these differences are larger than the expected precision of the satellite data to come .",
    "they clearly reflect the inadequate representation of the @xmath1-gradient zone in m2k , with higher - order schemes being more sensitive to the resulting inconsistency in the model .    in the top panel of fig .",

    "graco  and posc  are extremely close , while filou  and adipls  provide very similar results , with slightly larger differences for nosc , by about @xmath52hz , relative to these codes .",

    "the use of the richardson extrapolation is not very important , as expected for these modes of low order , with effects generally smaller than @xmath54hz , although a larger value is present for the mixed modes . using @xmath24 as variable gives differences larger than the differences among codes with the same  degrees of freedom \" .",
    "the use of the integration variable @xmath25 does not introduce significant differences . compared with model m2k",

    "this is obviously not a simple consequence of the doubling of the number of mesh points .",
    "the main reason is likely the inadequate resolution shown by model m2k in the description of the brunt - visl frequency in the region close to the boundary of the convective core , which is not present in model m4k .",
    "the avoided - crossing phenomenon and the behaviour of the mixed modes are very sensitive to the detailed treatment of this region , including the effects of semiconvection .",
    "therefore , an accurate description of @xmath19 is critical for the oscillation codes in order correctly to obtain eigenfrequencies for modes near an avoided crossing .",

    "this is the origin of the frequency differences .",
    "as the mode trapping in this region for these stellar models is related to the brunt - visl frequency in the @xmath1-gradient zone , the previously mentioned inadequate treatment of this region in model m2k is likely the reason for these differences .    the top panel of fig .",

    "further effects arise when there are problems with the brunt - visl frequency ( as for model m2k ) ; here a different choice can change the frequencies of some modes since @xmath19 does not appear in the differential equations when @xmath24 or the lawe are used and it does when using @xmath23 .",

    "the use of a second - order integration plus richardson extrapolation scheme is not distinguishable , in accuracy and precision , from the use of a fourth - order integration scheme .",
    "a correct physical and numerical description of the brunt - visl frequency is essential when @xmath23 is used as eigenfunction ; in particular , inconsistencies in the equation of state can have serious effects on the frequencies .",
    "inconsistency between the value of @xmath0 used in the oscillation calculation and the value used to compute the equilibrium model , within the range of the different values of @xmath0 found in the literature , may lead to substantial errors in the computed frequencies .",

    "however , since the product @xmath110 is known extremely precisely from planetary motion in the solar system , any variation in @xmath0 should be reflected in a corresponding change in the assumed value of @xmath111 . if this is the case , and if the model is characterized by a given value of @xmath12 ( as is typically the case ) the effect on the frequencies of changes in @xmath0 are very small ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in further tests",
    "more care is required to secure the full consistency of the models : a consistent equation of state should be used , and the value of @xmath0 should obviously be the same in the equilibrium - model and the pulsation calculations ; indeed , this strongly argues for including the value of @xmath0 as one of the parameters in the model file . the main conclusion of this extensive investigation , however , it positive : with a properly resolved equilibrium model the broad range of oscillation codes likely to be involved in the asteroseismic analysis of data from corot and other major upcoming projects generally give consistent results , well within the expected errors of the observations .",
    "thus , although the remaining problems in the calculation evidently require attention , we can be reasonably confident in our ability to compute frequencies of given models and hence in the inferences concerning stellar structure drawn from comparing the computed frequencies with the observations .",

    "<S> in order to make asteroseismology a powerful tool to explore stellar interiors , different numerical codes should give the same oscillation frequencies for the same input physics . </S>",
    "<S> any differences found when comparing the numerical values of the eigenfrequencies will be an important piece of information regarding the numerical structure of the code . </S>",
    "<S> the esta group was created to analyze the non - physical sources of these differences . </S>",
    "<S> the work presented in this report is a part of task  2 of the esta group . </S>",
    "<S> basically the work is devoted to test , compare and , if needed , optimize the seismic codes used to calculate the eigenfrequencies to be finally compared with observations . </S>",
    "<S> the first step in this comparison is presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation codes of nine research groups in the field have been used in this study . </S>",
    "<S> the same physics has been imposed for all the codes in order to isolate the non - physical dependence of any possible difference . </S>",
    "<S> two equilibrium models with different grids , 2172 and 4042 mesh points , have been used , and the latter model includes an explicit modelling of semiconvection just outside the convective core . comparing the results for these two models illustrates the effect of the number of mesh points and their distribution in particularly critical parts of the model , such as the steep composition gradient outside the convective core . </S>",
    "<S> a comprehensive study of the frequency differences found for the different codes is given as well . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are mainly due to the use of different numerical integration schemes . </S>",
    "<S> the number of mesh points and their distribution are crucial for interpreting the results . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a second - order integration scheme plus a richardson extrapolation provides similar results to a fourth - order integration scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the proper numerical description of the brunt - visl frequency in the equilibrium model is also critical for some modes . </S>",
    "<S> this influence depends on the set of the eigenfunctions used for the solution of the differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> an unexpected result of this study is the high sensitivity of the frequency differences to the inconsistent use of values of the gravitational constant ( @xmath0 ) in the oscillation codes , within the range of the experimentally determined ones , which differ from the value used to compute the equilibrium model . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can provide differences for a given equilibrium model substantially larger than those resulting from the use of different codes or numerical techniques ; the actual differences between the values of @xmath0 used by the different codes account for much of the frequency differences found here . </S>"
