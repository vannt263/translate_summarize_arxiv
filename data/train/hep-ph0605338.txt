    "the increase of hadronic total cross sections was theoretically predicted many years ago @xcite and this prediction has been accurately verified by experiment @xcite .",
    "nowadays , one of the main theoretical tools to explain this behavior is the diffractive formalism underlying the so called qcd - inspired models @xcite . in this formalism",
    "the scattering amplitude in the c.m .",
    "system is associated with semihard processes , i.e. processes with very small @xmath0 whose amplitudes can be calculated in perturbative qcd : at high energies the typical transverse momentum of semihard processes is relatively large and for wee partons in hadronic scattering processes it leads to small values for the strong coupling constant @xmath4 . at high energies",
    "semihard processes compete with `` soft '' ones which have traditionally been regarded as being responsible for the bulk of the hadronic cross section .",
    "hence the study of hadronic scattering processes is no further away from the qcd theory than , for example , the study of hard processes at small transverse distances ; as the energy increases , semihard processes are expected to give an increasing and significant part of the total hadronic cross section @xcite .",
    "this appealing idea is a feasible one since it is well known that experimental observations made it clear that at high energies the soft and the semihard components of hadron - hadron scattering are closely related , just as , for example , the observation of correlations between the average transverse momenta of hadrons produced and the multiplicity density in rapidity , @xcite and the copious production of gluon jets with moderate @xmath5 ( minijet phenomena ) in hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "qcd - inspired models incorporate soft and semihard processes in the treatment of high energy hadron - hadron interactions using a diffraction - scattering formulation compatible with analyticity and unitarity constraints . at large energies and fixed transverse momentum there is a rapid growing number of semihard gluons in the hadron , which is the main reason of the rising total cross section .",
    "therefore the rise of total hadronic cross section is intimately connected to the small @xmath0 behavior of the gluon distribution function and , within the range of applicability of these models , it can be used to investigate the gluon distribution exactly in the @xmath6 semihard region .    in qcd - inspired models a phenomenological gluon distribution with the behavior @xmath7 is used in the actual calculations , where @xmath8 .",
    "it could be asked why this approach has not been used before to determine the small @xmath0 behavior of @xmath9 .",
    "one possible reason lies in the fact that previous models were quite dependent on an _ ad hoc _ infrared cutoff mass scale and on the infrared value of the strong coupling constant ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , if @xmath9 at small @xmath0 is given by the above expression , the determination of @xmath11 would not be reliable since it appears multiplied by @xmath10 , which is a fitting parameter in the model .",
    "the freedom to choose the values of the mass scale and @xmath10 disappears in one improvement of the model , where the arbitrary mass scale is changed by a dynamical one @xcite . in this model",
    "( henceforth referred to as dgm model ) the onset of the dominance of semihard gluons in the interaction of high - energy hadrons is managed by the dynamical gluon mass @xmath12 @xcite ( intrinsically related to an infrared finite gluon propagator , @xcite ) whose existence is strongly supported by recent qcd lattice simulations @xcite as well as by phenomenological results @xcite ; for recent reviews on the phenomenology of massive gluons see ref . @xcite and references therein . in the dgm model",
    "the infrared coupling constant is also a function of the dynamical gluon mass @xcite .",
    "therefore we have a precise physical meaning for this infrared coupling as well as for the quoted dynamical mass scale , which is a natural regulator of the infrared divergences associated with the semihard gluon - gluon subprocess cross sections .",
    "these properties render the dgm model instrumental for a reliable determination of the qcd - predicted small @xmath0 distribution @xmath13 at moderate @xmath14 , namely the determination of the @xmath3 factor , where the @xmath15 scale is on the order of the dynamical gluon mass @xmath16 .",
    "this dynamical scale represents the onset of semihard contributions to hadronic diffractive scattering and hence provides the necessary scale in order to apply the diffractive formalism .",
    "the gluon distribution function is usually determined in the large @xmath14 region and its small @xmath0 limit in this region has been extensively discussed in recent times . therefore the results that we will discuss in this work can be considered phenomenologically important if we want to understand the match between these different kinematical regions . moreover",
    ", the gluon distribution at a low value of @xmath17 has to be taken into account in order to calculate the distribution at higher @xmath14 via dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "we show that the origin of such low @xmath18 initial distribution can be naturally related to the phenomenon of dynamical mass generation of gluons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the dgm model and show how the semihard gluon - gluon scattering can be properly eikonalized and linked to @xmath19 and @xmath20 diffractive scattering .",
    "our results for @xmath3 at moderate @xmath14 region are presented in the sec .",
    "iii , where we also address the question of extrapolating the gluon distribution function beyond the infrared @xmath14 range . in sec .",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "in order to set a natural moderate scale @xmath14 and produce a reliable determination of the factor @xmath3 , we explore the small @xmath0 behavior of @xmath21 in one eikonalized qcd - inspired model improved with a dynamical gluon mass @xcite . this model ( previously referred to as dgm model )",
    "provides a consistent calculation of total cross sections consonant with analyticity and unitarity constraints , and has already been applied successfully to describe @xmath19 and @xmath20 diffractive scattering data @xcite , as well as data on @xmath22 photoproduction and hadronic @xmath23 total cross sections @xcite . in the eikonal representation the total cross section is given by @xmath24 , \\label{eq21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the square of the total center - of - mass energy , @xmath26 is the impact parameter , and @xmath27 is a complex eikonal function . in the dgm model",

    "the odd eikonal @xmath35 , that accounts for the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath20 channels , is parametrized as @xmath36 where @xmath16 is the dynamical gluon mass ( which will be discussed afterward ) and the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constants to be fitted .",
    "the factor @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 with the dynamical coupling constant @xmath41 set at its frozen infrared value .",
    "the eikonal functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , needed to describe the low - energy forward data , are parametrized with terms dictated by the regge phenomenology . the formal expressions of these quantities as well as details concerning the analyticity properties of the model amplitudes can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the dgm model",
    "the main contribution to the asymptotic behavior of hadron - hadron total cross sections comes from semihard gluon - gluon collisions .",
    "the gluon eikonal term @xmath44 is written as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the convoluted structure function for pair gluon - gluon ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 is the complete cross section for the subprocess @xmath50 , calculated through the dynamical perturbation theory ( dpt ) @xcite , where the effective gluon propagator and coupling constant enters into the calculation .",
    "these effective quantities were obtained as solutions of the schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) for the gluon propagator and triple gluon vertex via the pinch technique @xcite , and have been used in many phenomenological calculations that are sensible to their infrared finite behavior @xcite . in this approach the nonperturbative running coupling @xmath41 and the functional expression of the dynamical gluon mass @xmath51",

    "the dynamical gluon mass @xmath16 has to be found phenomenologically , and a typical value ( for @xmath59 mev ) is @xmath60 mev @xcite .",
    "the expression of @xmath61 comes out as a solution of the gluon propagator sde and @xmath12 is interpreted as the gluon dynamical mass , being related to the value of the propagator at @xmath62 .",
    "this mass has a dynamical origin , which , in principle , should be calculated in terms of the scale @xmath54 , and in this work it will be used as an input parameter . as discussed in detail in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the total cross section @xmath63 for the subprocess @xmath64 is obtained by integrating over @xmath65 . in setting these kinematical limits",
    "we have neglected the momentum behavior in eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ mdyna ] ) , since the calculation of the hadronic cross section does not depend strongly on the specific form of @xmath66 , but more on its infrared value ( i.e. the value of @xmath16 )",

    "the factor @xmath72 is introduced in accord with the spectator counting rules at high @xmath0 @xcite . in the regge language",
    "the quantity @xmath73 is the intercept of the pomeron .",
    "as we go up in energy ( @xmath74 and transferred momenta @xmath75 ) the proton will be filled up with more and more semihard gluons , and we will be probing the small @xmath0 region .",
    "therefore we see that the behavior of the total hadronic cross section at higher energies is driven by only four parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath73 , @xmath11 and @xmath76 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) , ( [ eq22 ] ) , ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ dist33 ] ) ) .",

    "the connexion between the dynamical gluon mass @xmath80 and the scale @xmath81 arises as follows : the qcd improved parton model is not applicable only in the region in which the transverse momenta @xmath5 of the colliding hadrons is of the same order as their center - of - mass energy , but also in the region in which @xmath82 provided that @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "hence it is possible to investigate the interface between high @xmath5 region and regge limit one by means of perturbative methods . in the dgm model",
    "we introduce the physical energy threshold @xmath84 for the final state gluons ( see expression ( [ eq28 ] ) ) , assuming that these are screened gluons , in a procedure similar to the calculation of ref . @xcite . in this way , adopting the relation @xmath85 , we establish the expected particle production threshold @xmath86 .",
    "note that the gluon distribution function ( [ dist33 ] ) reduces to @xmath87 in the limit @xmath88 , as expected by dimensional counting rules , and , more importantly , reproduces the small @xmath0 qcd prediction @xmath89 in this context , given the high - energy nature of the data to be fitted in the following analysis , we are specially concerned with the determination of @xmath90 in its small @xmath0 region and transferred momenta of the same order as the dynamical gluon masses . as we shall discuss in the next section the cross section described by eq .",

    "@xcite ( although the uncertainty in this value is of @xmath93 ) , and we are in a moderate region of momenta , and above the nonperturbative region determined by the qcd scale ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "in the determination of the small scale dependence of the gluon distribution we explore the small @xmath0 behavior of @xmath90 in one eikonalized qcd - based model improved with a dynamical gluon mass .",
    "we carry out global fits to high - energy @xmath19 and @xmath20 scattering data above @xmath95 gev in order to determine phenomenological values for the factor @xmath11 as a function of dynamical gluon mass @xmath16 .",
    "note that at this @xmath96 value the dynamics responsible for the cross section increase with energy is already effective .",
    "these data sets include the total cross section ( @xmath78 ) and the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude ( @xmath79 parameter ) .",
    "we use the data sets compiled and analyzed by the particle data group @xcite , with the statistic and systematic errors added in quadrature . in all the fits we use a @xmath97 fitting procedure , adopting an interval @xmath98 corresponding , in the case of normal errors , to the projection of the @xmath97 hypersurface containing 90% of probability . in the case of 8 fitting parameters ( dgm model )",
    "this corresponds to the interval @xmath99 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the behavior of the total @xmath19 and @xmath77 cross sections at higher energies is driven specially by four parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath73 , @xmath11 and @xmath76 .",

    "this input dynamical gluon mass range is also supported by recent studies via the model on survival probability of rapidity gaps in diffractive scattering @xcite as well as on the @xmath102 photoproduction and the hadronic @xmath103 total cross sections @xcite .",
    "we stress that if we had used @xmath12 as another parameter to be fitted we would reproduce the results of fig.(1 ) of ref .",

    "this value is compatible with the recent result @xmath111 , obtained through the use of non - linear trajectories for the meson resonances @xcite . also , a regge fit of the proton structure function data indicates the presence of a second pomeron , with the hard intercept @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "this last value of @xmath108 is compatible with the one expected for the exponent @xmath113 from the perturbative bfkl approach @xcite , namely @xmath114 .",
    "however , there is a lack of theoretical precision about the precise value of @xmath113 once their value is dependent upon an infrared cut - off @xmath115 at transverse momenta of gluons @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also possible that the phenomenon of dynamical gluon mass generation push the perturbative @xmath113 value to a smaller one as was shown years ago by ross @xcite .",
    "more importantly , in what follows we will show that the use of a hard value to the pomeron intercept gives a bad fit to @xmath78 and @xmath79 parameter data .",
    "it shows that in fact the increase of hadron - hadron total cross sections is governed by soft values of @xmath73 , as already expected from regge and analytical models @xcite .",

    "the small @xmath0 gluon distribution function is given by @xmath190 where the gluon propagator ( @xmath191 ) is the effective one with the perturbative part subtracted from the integral .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) does not contain the @xmath192 contribution which has to be put by hand in the ln model .",
    "this calculation with cornwall s propagator , where we can substitute @xmath193 by @xmath194 , gives @xmath195 : this value is basically equal to the value obtained in cdl approach @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our results with the cdl one shows that our values of @xmath11 are quite reasonable .",
    "more explicitly , shows that the cdl result of @xmath11 is compatible with the dgm one at mass scales on the order of @xmath196 mev ( see table i ) .",
    "dynamical gluon masses of that order where obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to obtain the survival probability @xmath197 of rapidity gaps in diffractive scattering from production of higgs boson via @xmath198 fusion processes .",
    "these survival factors are compatible with recent results of @xmath199 obtained by khoze , martin and ryskin through a two - channel eikonal model which embodies pion - loop insertions in the pomeron trajectory , diffractive dissociation , and rescattering effects @xcite . in addition , in the analysis via dgm model of the @xmath22 photoproduction and the hadronic @xmath23 total cross sections , both derived from the @xmath19 and @xmath77 scattering amplitudes assuming vector meson dominance , there is room for smaller values of @xmath16 beside the adopted mass scale @xmath200 gev @xcite .",
    "all these results suggest a most restrictive mass range than the one we have considered up to now . given the behavior of @xmath168 obtained through the dgm model",
    ", we can be confident in the mass range @xmath201 mev as a more reliable one .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath14 scale interval @xmath202 gev@xmath129 .",
    "it is clear that the dynamical gluon mass is a concept that has not been made totally compatible with perturbative qcd , this will probably demand time and a great effort , although the introduction of this concept is clearly consistent with the experimental data and indicate a more appealing view to the behavior of @xmath9 at small @xmath0 and moderate @xmath14 .    in summary , we think that the dgm model is an useful tool in determining the behavior of the gluon distribution function at moderate @xmath14 by merging in a natural way the soft and the semihard components of hadronic scattering processes . we emphasize that it is a nontrivial result that our gluon distribution behavior at small @xmath0 is on the order of the mrst one at @xmath128 gev@xmath129 .",
    "this is achieved with only three parameters , namely @xmath16 , @xmath73 and @xmath11 .",
    "the natural relation between the momentum scale @xmath15 and the dynamical gluon mass @xmath16 argues the dynamical mass generation of partons to be the main mechanism behind the nonperturbative dynamics of the valence - like parton distributions present at low resolution scales .",
