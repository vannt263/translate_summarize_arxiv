    "in a recent series of papers @xcite , we have considered some theoretical aspects of the dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with weak long - range interactions @xcite . in these systems",
    ", the interaction potential @xmath2 decays with a rate slower than @xmath3 at large distances , where @xmath4 is the dimension of space ( these potentials are sometimes called `` non - integrable '' ) . as a result",
    ", any particle feels a potential dominated by interactions with far away particles ( i.e. the interaction is not restricted to nearest neighbours ) and the energy is _ non - additive_. this can lead to striking properties ( absent in systems with short - range interactions ) such as inequivalence of statistical ensembles and negative specific heats in the microcanonical ensemble . on the other hand , the usual thermodynamic limit @xmath5 with @xmath6 fixed is not relevant for these systems and must be reconsidered .",
    "if we write the potential of interaction as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coupling constant , then the appropriate thermodynamic limit for weak long - range interactions corresponds to @xmath9 in such a way that the coupling constant @xmath10 and the volume @xmath11 . in that limit , we have an _ extensive _ scaling of the energy @xmath12 and entropy @xmath13 ( while the temperature @xmath14 ) , but the system remains fundamentally _ non - additive_. other equivalent combinations of the parameters are possible to define the thermodynamic limit as discussed in @xcite and in various contributions of @xcite . for systems with weak long - range interactions",
    ", it is often claimed that the mean field approximation is a very good approximation and that it becomes exact in the proper thermodynamic limit @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , this is true only if we are far from a critical point .",
    "close to a critical point , the fluctuations become large and can not be ignored . in that case",
    ", the two - body correlation function does not factor out in a product of two one - body distribution functions and the mean field approximation breaks down . it is therefore highly desirable to derive stochastic kinetic equations that go beyond the mean field approximation and that take full account of fluctuations .",
    "this is the main object of the present paper .    in our previous studies ,",
    "we have distinguished two types of systems : hamiltonian and brownian .",
    "hamiltonian systems with long - range interactions are _ isolated _ and evolve at fixed energy .",
    "the dynamics of the particles is described by @xmath15 coupled deterministic newton equations . since the energy is conserved , the relevant statistical ensemble is the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath15-body distribution function is governed by the liouville equation and the statistical equilibrium state is described by the microcanonical distribution .",
    "examples of such systems are provided by stellar systems @xcite , two - dimensional vortices @xcite and the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite ; see also the important list of references in these papers .",
    "brownian systems with long - range interactions , on the other hand , are _ dissipative _ and evolve at fixed temperature .",
    "the particles are subject to their mutual long - range interactions but they experience , in addition , a friction force and a stochastic force which mimic the interaction with a thermal bath ( that is due to _ short - range _ interactions ) .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the particles is described by @xmath15 coupled stochastic langevin equations .",
    "the temperature is defined through the einstein relation as the ratio between the diffusion coefficient and the friction coefficient , and it measures the strength of the stochastic force . since the temperature is fixed , the relevant statistical ensemble is the canonical ensemble .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath15-body distribution function is governed by the fokker - planck equation and the statistical equilibrium state is described by the canonical distribution .",
    "examples of such systems are provided by self - gravitating brownian particles @xcite , bacterial populations experiencing chemotaxis @xcite and the brownian mean field ( bmf ) model @xcite .",
    "systems with long - range interactions have a very peculiar dynamics and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "when the interaction is attractive , there exists a critical point separating a spatially homogeneous ( gaseous ) phase from a spatially inhomogeneous ( clustered ) phase . in the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) , the `` clustered '' phase appears below a critical energy @xmath16 and in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) , it appears below a critical temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the homogeneous phase may still exist for @xmath18 or @xmath19 but is dynamically and thermodynamically unstable .",
    "one fundamental illustration of this type of phase transitions corresponds to the famous jeans instability in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "for the jeans problem , the critical temperature @xmath20 so that the system is always in the `` clustered '' phase : this corresponds to the universe that we know , filled of galaxies .",
    "a spatially homogeneous distribution of matter is always unstable to sufficiently large wavelengths , above the jeans length @xmath21 , and this leads to gravitational collapse and clustering . if we formally consider a screened newtonian interaction ( attractive yukawa potential ) with screening length @xmath22 , we find that the phase transition occurs at a finite critical temperature @xmath23 separating a homogeneous phase from a clustered phase @xcite .",
    "for @xmath24 the homogeneous phase is stable and for @xmath19 it becomes unstable to wavenumbers @xmath25 .",
    "alternatively , we can consider a spatially inhomogeneous self - gravitating gas in a spherical box of radius @xmath26 . in that case , there exists a critical energy @xmath27 in mce ( discovered by antonov @xcite for stellar systems ) and a critical temperature @xmath28 in ce ( discovered by emden @xcite for isothermal stars and recently emphasized by the author for molecular clouds in contact with a thermal bath @xcite and for self - gravitating brownian particles @xcite ) below which the system passes from a slightly inhomogeneous gaseous phase to a highly inhomogeneous condensed phase .",
    "interestingly , the analogue of these `` gravitational phase transitions '' also takes place in the context of the chemotaxis of bacterial populations in biology @xcite . in these systems , an infinite and uniform distribution of cells _",
    "is _ a steady state of the equations of motion ( the so - called keller - segel model and its generalizations ) so there is no `` jeans swindle '' .",
    "furthermore , the screened yukawa potential enters naturally in the problem and the screening length has a clear physical interpretation as it takes into account the degradation of the secreted chemical .",
    "another illustration of this type of phase transitions is given by the study of toy models like the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) and the brownian mean field ( bmf ) models @xcite .",
    "for these systems , there exists a critical energy @xmath29 and a critical temperature @xmath30 separating a spatially homogeneous ( non - magnetized ) phase from a spatially inhomogeneous ( magnetized ) phase .",
    "the magnetization plays the role of the order parameter and the phase transition is second order in that case @xcite .",
    "we expect the above - mentioned types of phase transitions , and their generalizations @xcite , to occur for a large class of mean field systems with different potentials of interaction .    the critical point separating the homogeneous phase from the inhomogeneous phase",
    "is often called a _",
    "spinodal point_. the instability threshold of the homogeneous phase can be obtained from different classical methods : ( i ) by studying the sign of the second order variations of the thermodynamical potential ( entropy in mce or free energy in ce ) and determining when the spatially uniform distribution becomes an unstable saddle point ( see , e.g. , sec .",

    "the one - body distribution function is trivial ( it is spatially uniform with a maxwellian velocity distribution ) and the state of the system is usually characterized by the two - body distribution function . for weak long - range interactions , the two - body correlation function @xmath31 can be obtained from the equilibrium bbgky - hierarchy at the order @xmath32 by neglecting the three - body correlation function that is of order @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the debye - hckel approximation in plasma physics .",
    "it is found however that , for large but fixed @xmath15 , the fourier transform of the correlation function diverges at the critical point ( or at the instability threshold ) so that the mean field approximation breaks down close to the critical point .",
    "this implies that the phase transition should take place _",
    "strictly before _ the critical point ( or strictly before the instability threshold ) predicted by mean field theory . in @xcite , we have reached this conclusion from the study of the equilibrium bbgky hierarchy . in the present work",
    ", we would like to complement our previous studies by developing a theory of fluctuations starting directly from the stochastic kinetic equation governing the evolution of the fluctuating density field . in this paper",

    "the decay rate @xmath37 of the temporal correlations coincides with the decay rate of the perturbations @xmath38 governed by the deterministic mean field smoluchowski equation ( without noise ) . on the other hand , for @xmath19 ,",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function @xmath39 diverges as we approach the instability threshold @xmath40 , suggesting that the instability takes place sooner than predicted by mean field theory ( for @xmath24 , considering the `` dangerous '' mode @xmath41 , the correlation function diverges as we approach the critical point @xmath42 ) .",
