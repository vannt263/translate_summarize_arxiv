    "breaking the @xmath18 and @xmath19 norms of the solution remain finite while the spatial derivative @xmath20 becomes unbounded pointwise .",
    "this phenomenon can best be described for a particular class of solutions , namely the multipeakons . for simplicity",

    "saxton equation lipschitz continuous on an appropriate function space .",

    "are based on a reformulation ( distinct in the two approaches ) of the camassa ",
    "holm equation as a semilinear system of ordinary differential equations taking values in a banach space .",
    "this formulation allows one to continue the solution beyond collision time , giving either a global conservative solution where the energy is conserved for almost all times or a dissipative solution where energy may vanish from the system .",
    "local existence of the semilinear system is obtained by a contraction argument .",
    "going back to the original function @xmath3 , one obtains a global solution of the camassa ",

    ", they construct solutions for any initial data ( not just the multipeakons ) and the lipschitz continuity follows from . as in @xcite ,",
    "the goal of this article is to construct a metric which makes the flow lipschitz continuous .",
    "however , we base the construction of the metric directly on the reformulation of the equation which is used to construct the solutions themselves , and we use some fundamental geometrical properties of this reformulation ( relabeling invariance , see below ) .",
    "the metric is defined on the set @xmath56 which includes configurations where part of the energy is concentrated on sets of measure zero ; a natural choice for conservative solutions . in particular , we obtain that the lipschitz continuity holds for all times and not just for almost all times as in @xcite .",
    "let us describe in some detail the approach in this paper , which follows @xcite quite closely in setting up the reformulated equation .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the solution , and @xmath58 the corresponding characteristics , thus @xmath59 .",
    "our new variables are @xmath58 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 corresponds to the lagrangian velocity while @xmath62 could be interpreted as the lagrangian cumulative energy distribution . in the periodic case",

    "holm equation .",
    "global existence of solutions of is obtained starting from a contraction argument , see theorem [ th : global ] .",
    "the issue of continuation of the solution past wave breaking is resolved by considering the set @xmath56 ( see definition [ def : d ] ) which consists of pairs @xmath65 such that @xmath66 if @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a positive radon measure with period one , and whose absolutely continuous part satisfies @xmath69 . with three lagrangian variables @xmath70 versus two eulerian variables @xmath65 , it is clear that there can be no bijection between the two coordinate systems .",
    "if two lagrangian variables correspond to one and the same solution in eulerian variables , we say that the lagrangian variables are relabelings of each other . to resolve the relabeling issue we define a group of transformations which acts on the lagrangian variables and lets the system of equations invariant .",
    "we are able to establish a bijection between the space of eulerian variables and the space of lagrangian variables when we identify variables that are invariant under the action of the group .",
    "this bijection allows us to transform the results obtained in the lagrangian framework ( in which the equation is well - posed ) into the eulerian framework ( in which the situation is much more subtle ) . to obtain a lipschitz metric in eulerian",
    "coordinates we start by constructing one in the lagrangian setting . to this end",
    "we start by identifying a set @xmath71 ( see definition [ def : f ] ) that leaves the flow invariant , that is , if @xmath72 then the solution @xmath73 of with @xmath74 will remain in @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "next , we identify a subgroup @xmath76 , see definition [ def : g ] , of the group of homeomorphisms on the unit interval , and we interpret @xmath76 as the set of relabeling functions . from this",

    "this establishes a bijection between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , see lemma [ lemma : bijection ] , and therefore between @xmath81 and @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we define a semigroup @xmath84 on @xmath81 ( definition [ def : bars ] ) , and the next task is to identify a metric that makes the flow @xmath85 lipschitz continuous on @xmath81 .",
    "we use the bijection between @xmath81 and @xmath56 to transport the metric from @xmath81 to @xmath56 and get a lipschitz continuous flow on @xmath56 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors define the metric on @xmath81 by simply taking the norm of the underlying banach space ( the set @xmath81 is a nonlinear subset of a banach space ) .",
    "they obtain in this way a metric which makes the flow continuous but not lipschitz continuous . as we will see ( see remark [ rem : compmetric ] ) , this",
    "metric is stronger than the one we construct here and for which the flow is lipschitz continuous . in @xcite , for the hunter ",
    "saxton equation , the authors use ideas from riemannian geometry and construct a semimetric which identifies points that belong to the same equivalence class .",
    "the riemannian framework seems however too rigid for the camassa ",
    "holm equation , and we have not been able to carry out this approach . however , we retain the essential idea which consists of finding a semimetric which identifies equivalence classes . instead of a riemannian metric , we use a discrete counterpart . note that this technique will also work for the hunter  saxton and will give the same metric as in @xcite .",
    "a natural candidate for a semimetric which identifies equivalence classes is ( cf .  )",
    "@xmath86 which is invariant with respect to relabeling .",
    "however , it does not satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "nevertheless it can be modified to satisfy all the requirements for a metric if we instead define , see definition [ def : alberto ] , the following quantity @xmath87 where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences @xmath88 which satisfy @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "one can then prove that @xmath91 is a metric on @xmath81 , see lemma [ lemma : distance ] .",
    "finally , we prove that the flow is lipschitz continuous in this metric , see theorem [ th : stab ] . to transfer this result to the eulerian variables we reconstruct these variables from the lagrangian coordinates as in @xcite : given @xmath92",

    "we denote the mapping from @xmath71 to @xmath56 by @xmath97 , and the inverse restricted to @xmath81 by @xmath98 .",
    "the natural metric on @xmath56 , denoted @xmath2 , is then defined by @xmath99 for two elements @xmath100 in @xmath56 , see definition [ def : dd ] .",
    "the main theorem , theorem [ th : main ] , then states that the metric @xmath2 is lipschitz continuous on all states with finite energy . in the last section , section [ sec : topology ] ,",
    "the metric is compared with the standard norms .",
    "two results are proved : the mapping @xmath101 is continuous from @xmath6 into @xmath56 ( proposition [ prop : cont1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath102 is a sequence in @xmath56 that converges to @xmath65 in @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath103 in @xmath7 and @xmath104 ( proposition [ prop : cont2 ] ) .",
    "the problem of lipschitz continuity can nicely be illustrated in the simpler context of ordinary differential equations .",
    "consider three differential equations :    @xmath105    straightforward computations give as solutions    @xmath106    we find that    @xmath107    thus we see that in the regular case we get a lipschitz estimate with constant @xmath108 uniformly bounded as @xmath55 ranges on a bounded interval . in the second case",
    "we get a lipschitz estimate uniformly valid for all @xmath109 . in the final example , by restricting attention to strictly increasing solutions of the ordinary differential equations , we achieve uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial data , but without any lipschitz estimate at all near the point @xmath110 .",
    "we observe that , by introducing the riemannian metric @xmath111 an easy computation reveals that @xmath112 let us explain why this metric can be considered as a riemannian metric .",
    "the euclidean metric between the two points is then given @xmath113 where the infimum is taken over all paths @xmath114\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] that join the two points @xmath115 and @xmath116 , that is , @xmath117 and @xmath118 . however , as we have seen , the solutions are not lipschitz for the euclidean metric .",
    "thus we want to measure the infinitesimal variation @xmath119 in an alternative way , which makes solutions of equation lipschitz continuous .",
    "we look at the evolution equation that governs @xmath119 and , by differentiating with respect to @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 and we can check that @xmath122 let us consider the real line as a riemannian manifold where , at any point @xmath16 , the riemannian norm is given by @xmath123 for any tangent vector @xmath124 in the tangent space of @xmath125 . from , one can see that at the infinitesimal level , this riemannian norm is exactly preserved by the evolution equation .",
    "the distance on the real line which is naturally inherited by this riemannian is given by @xmath126 where the infimum is taken over all paths @xmath114\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] joining @xmath115 and @xmath127 .",
    "it is quite reasonable to restrict ourselves to paths that satisfy @xmath128 and then , by a change of variables , we recover the definition .",
    "the riemannian approach to measure a distance between any two distinct points in a given set ( as defined in ) requires the existence of a smooth path between points in the set . in the case of the hunter ",
    "saxton ( see @xcite ) , we could embed the set we were primarily interested in into a convex set ( which is therefore connected ) and which also could be regularized ( so that the riemannian metric we wanted to use in that case could be defined ) . in the case of the camassa ",
    "holm equation , we have been unable to construct such a set",
    ". however , there exists the alternative approach which , instead of using a smooth path to join points , uses finite sequences of points , see .",
    "we illustrate this approach with equation .",
    "we want to define a metric in @xmath129 which makes the semigroup of solutions lipschitz stable .",
    "given two points @xmath130 , we define the function @xmath131 as @xmath132      \\frac{\\bar{x}-x}{x^{1/2}}&\\text {        if $ x<\\bar{x}$}.    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the function @xmath133 is symmetric and @xmath134 if and only if @xmath135 , but @xmath133 does not satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "therefore we define ( cf .  ) @xmath136 where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences @xmath137 such that @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "then , @xmath140 satisfies the triangle inequality and one can prove that it is also a metric .",
