    "the function of many physiological systems depends on branched structures that exist both at the tissue ( e.g. nervous plexi , lungs , and the vascular and lymphatic systems ) and the cellular level ( e.g. neurons ) .",
    "of particular interest , local and global propagation of electrical signals within the nervous system depends on the integration , processing , and further generation of electrical pulses that travel through neurons . in turn , the tree - like morphology of neurons facilitates simultaneous signaling to cells located in different places and over long distances .",
    "neuronal morphology is typically modeled by assuming that the shape of small neuronal segments , or _",
    "neurites _ , is approximated by cylinders of different diameters . as a consequence ,",
    "cable theory @xcite , rall60 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite plays a central role in the theoretical and experimental study of electrical conduction in neurons ; see , for example @xcite , bluman : tuckwell87 , @xcite , @xcite , cox : raol04 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . notably , one of the most interesting results from recent theoretical work is that geometrical properties of neuronal membranes may exert powerful effects on signal propagation even in the presence of voltage - dependent channels vett : roth : haus01 .",
    "theoretical research involving realistic neuronal morphologies is typically done by numerically solving systems of cable equations defined on cylinders with different radii , and assuming that voltage and current are continuous functions of space and time . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "graphical methods seem have not been widely applied yet in the mathematical modeling of neurons .",
    "graphical methods are very useful and popular in different branches of modern physics .",
    "it is worth noting , for example , feynman diagrams in quantum mechanical or statistical field theory @xcite , akh : ber , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , fynmanqed , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , vilenkin - kuznetsov - smorodinskii approach to solutions of @xmath0-dimensional laplace equation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , smor76 , applications in solid - state theory , etc .",
    "a goal of this paper is to make a modest step in this direction ( see also @xcite , coombesetal07 and references therein ) .",

    "at a closer view , neurites can be regarded as volumes of revolution , defined by rotating a smooth function @xmath1 representing the local radius of the neurite where @xmath2 represents distance along the neurite . as a result ,",
    "the cable theory implies the following set of equations @xcite , @xcite:@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5here , @xmath6 represents the voltage difference across the membrane ( interior minus exterior ) as a deviation from its resting value , @xmath7 is the membrane current density , @xmath8 is the total axial current , @xmath9 is the membrane resistance , @xmath10 is the intercellular resistivity and @xmath11 is membrane capacitance ( more details can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . differentiating equation  ( [ cable3 ] ) with respect to @xmath2 and substituting the result into ( [ cable1 ] ) with the help of ( [ cable2 ] ) one gets@xmath12which is the cable equation with tapering for a single branch of dendritic tree ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and surkisetal96 for more details )",

    "we shall use these conditions for the steady - state and transient solutions of the cable equation .",
