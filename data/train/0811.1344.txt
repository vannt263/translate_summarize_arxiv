    "the spin - triplet or @xmath0-wave pairing allows parallel spin orientation of the fermion cooper pairs in superfluid @xmath1he and unconventional superconductors  @xcite . for this reason the resulting unconventional superconductivity is robust with respect to effects of external magnetic field and spontaneous ferromagnetic order ,",
    "so it may coexist with the latter .",
    "this general argument implies that there could be metallic compounds and alloys , for which the coexistence of spin - triplet superconductivity and ferromagnetism may be observed .",
    "particularly , both superconductivity and itinerant ferromagnetic orders can be created by the same band electrons in the metal , which means that spin-1 electron cooper pairs participate in the formation of the itinerant ferromagnetic order . moreover , under certain conditions the superconductivity is enhanced rather than depressed by the uniform ferromagnetic order that can generate it , even in cases when the superconductivity does not appear in a pure form as a net result of indirect electron - electron coupling .    the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism as a result of collective behavior of @xmath2-band electrons has been found experimentally for some uranium - based intermetallic compounds as , uge@xmath3  @xcite , urhge  @xcite , ucoge  @xcite , and uir  @xcite . at low temperature @xmath4",
    "all these compounds exhibit thermodynamically stable phase of coexistence of spin - triplet superconductivity and itinerant ( @xmath2-band ) electron ferromagnetism ( in short , fs phase ) . in uge@xmath3 and uir the fs phase appears at high pressure @xmath5 whereas in urhge and ucoge , the coexistence phase persists up to ambient pressure @xmath6 .",
    "experiments , carried out in zrzn@xmath3  @xcite , also indicated the appearance of fs phase at @xmath7 k in a wide range of pressures ( @xmath8 ) . in zr - based compounds",
    "the ferromagnetism and the @xmath0-wave superconductivity occur as a result of the collective behavior of the @xmath9-band electrons . later",
    "experimental results  @xcite had imposed the conclusion that bulk superconductivity is lacking in zrzn@xmath3 , but the occurrence of a surface fs phase at surfaces with higher zr content than that in zrzn@xmath3 has been reliably demonstrated .",
    "thus the problem for the coexistence of bulk superconductivity with ferromagnetism in zrzn@xmath3 is still unresolved .",
    "this raises the question whether the fs phase in zrzn@xmath3 should be studied by surface thermodynamics methods , or it can be investigated by considering that bulk and surface thermodynamic phenomena can be treated on the same footing . taking in account the mentioned experimental results for zrzn@xmath3 and their interpretation by the experimentalists",
    "@xcite we assume that the unified thermodynamic approach can be applied , although some specific properties of the fs phase in zrzn@xmath3 , if its surface nature is confirmed , will certainly need special study by surface thermodynamics .",

    "arguments supporting our point of view are given in several preceding investigations .",

    "@xcite ) , the system dimensionality can be distinguished by the values of the landau parameters . here",
    "we specify the values of these parameters from the experimental data for spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors . when the landau parameters are obtained from microscopic theories , their values depend on the dimension @xmath11 , only if the respective theory takes into account relevant fluctuation modes of order parameter fields , including long - scale fluctuation modes .",
    "we are not aware of well developed theories of this type which may figure out the complex behavior of the mentioned systems . even in simple theories of band electron magnetism ,",
    "the landau parameters are very complex functions of the density of states at the fermi level and related microscopic parameters .",
    "such complexity does not allow direct comparison between the results from microscopic theory and the experimental data . to make a progress in this situation we assume that the material parameters of our theory are loosely defined and may have values , corresponding to various approximate microscopic theories , as mean - field approximation , spin - fluctuation theory , etc .    for all compounds , cited above , the fs phase occurs only in the ferromagnetic phase domain of the @xmath14 diagram . particularly at equilibrium , and for given @xmath15 , the temperature @xmath16 of the normal - to - ferromagnetic phase ( or n - fm ) transition is never lower than the temperature @xmath17 of the ferromagnetic - to - fs phase transition ( fm - fs transition ) .",
    "this confirms the point of view that the superconductivity in these compounds is triggered by the spontaneous magnetization @xmath18 , in analogy with the well - known triggering of the superfluid phase a@xmath19 in @xmath1he at mk temperatures by the external magnetic field @xmath20 .",

    "we show that the basic low and ultra - low temperature properties of the spin - triplet fss , as given by the preceding experiments , are derived from the model ( 1 ) without any account of fluctuation phenomena and quantum correlations .",
    "the latter might be of use in a more detailed consideration of the close vicinity of quantum critical points in the phase diagrams of spin - triplet fss .",

    "<S> we present a general thermodynamic theory that describes phases and phase transitions of ferromagnetic superconductors with spin - triplet electron cooper pairing . the theory is based on extended ginzburg - landau expansion in powers of superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple form for the dependence of theory parameters on the pressure that allows correct theoretical outline of the temperature - pressure phase diagram for which at low temperatures a stable phase of coexistence of @xmath0-wave superconductivity and itinerant ferromagnetism appears . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the theory is in an agreement with the experimental data for some intermetallic compounds that are experimentally proven to be itinerant ferromagnetic exhibiting spin - triplet superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> some basic features of quantum phase transitions in such systems are explained and clarified . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to group the spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors in two different types of thermodynamic behavior , on the basis of quantitative criterion deduced from the present theory and the analysis of experimental data . </S>"
