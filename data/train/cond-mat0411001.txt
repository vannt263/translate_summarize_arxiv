    "the large backgrounds cause an uncertainty in extracting the field - induced part , and can easily obscure the small angular variation .        with those problems in mind",
    ", we built a new specific heat probe designed exclusively to study the gap structure of superconductors in momentum space .",
    "instead of varying temperature as was done in many previous works , we fixed temperature and magnetic field intensity and made the field angle as an only variable .",
    "this experimental scheme enabled us to study the small angular oscillation , which is typically less than 1 @xmath15 of the measured heat capacity .",
    "some of the key ingredients to this scheme are as following .",
    "first , temperature and magnetic field should be very stable .",
    "otherwise , even a small fluctuation could obscure the small change with angle .",
    "a physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) by quantum design was used as a cryogenics platform to satisfy those conditions .",

    "the front face of the sample was coated with colloidal graphite suspension ( dag ) thinned with isopropyl alcohol to prevent a possible change of the optical absorptions of the sample .",
    "the sample was weakly coupled to the heat bath through helium gas and suspending thermocouple wires . at high temperatures",
    ", the thermal coupling can be adjusted mainly by controlling the amount of the helium gas surrounding the sample , while the thermal leak through thermocouple wires should be taken into account at cryogenic temperatures . as a heating source , infrared laser light ( @xmath19 nm ) was used .",
    "the light was modulated electronically to make a square - wave pulse and was guided into the ppms sample space through an optical fiber .",
    "the oscillating heat input incurred a steady temperature offset ( or @xmath20 offset ) against the heat bath with an oscillating temperature superposed .",
    "the measured oscillation temperature @xmath21 was converted to heat capacity by the relationship @xmath22 in a proper frequency range .    in our field - angle heat capacity measurements ,",
    "two thermocouple pairs were used to measure the temperature oscillations @xmath21 simultaneously .",
    "the two sets of au / fe and chromel thermocouple wires were configured so that they were 90@xmath16 apart , which enabled us to rule out the field - angle contribution from the thermocouple wires due to field - dependent thermopower of au / fe . if the angular oscillations come from our experimental setup , the two signals will be out of phase while they will be in phase with each other if they come from sample . as an example",
    ", we studied an optimally doped ybco ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the squares in the top panel describe the angular heat capacity measured by the first pair of the thermocouple wires and the circles by the second pair .",
    "the two sets of data were measured simultaneously at 1.7  k in 7  t with magnetic field rotating within the cuo@xmath0 plane of ybco .",
    "both of them show clear two - fold oscillations with field angle measured against a - axis .",
