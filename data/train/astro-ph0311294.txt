    "these observational estimates constrain the evolution of the stellar mass density @xmath11 as a function of redshift or cosmic time .",
    "the observations indicate the presence of a significant stellar population at high redshift , and , by comparing with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , some authors claim that @xmath0cdm models seriously _ underpredict _ galaxy formation at @xmath4 .",
    "for example , @xcite compare their estimate of @xmath11 from the hubble deep field ( hdf ) south with the semi - analytic model of @xcite , and argue that the high - mass tail of the galaxy stellar mass function is not adequately described by cdm models .",
    "comparing to the same semi - analytic model , @xcite argue that hierarchical models lack sufficient star formation at @xmath12 , resulting in a failure to reproduce the pronounced brightening of the luminosity function at these redshifts .",
    "also , @xcite find that their data from the hdf north suggest a steeper increase in @xmath11 than some semi - analytic models @xcite , and some of the semi - analytic models predict _ higher _ stellar mass density compared to their data points . given these contradicting claims and the large parameter space available to the semi - analytic models as well as the limitations of the current observational samples , it is not clear at present if any of these discrepancies actually pose a serious problem to hierarchical evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the observational data with the results from state - of - the - art cosmological simulations of the standard concordance @xmath13cdm model and the theoretical model of @xcite ( hereafter h&s model ) , to show that , contrary to some of the claims , theory predicts a _ higher _ @xmath11 at @xmath14 than indicated by current observations and that the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) density peaks at @xmath15 , earlier than suggested by most semi - analytic models . also , we will explicitly compare our results with those from the updated semi - analytic models by @xcite , @xcite ( galform ) , and @xcite",
    "we will show results from two different types of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "both approaches include `` standard '' physics such as radiative cooling / heating , star formation , and supernova ( sn ) feedback , although the details of the models and the parameter choices differ somewhat .",

    "the treatment of the radiative cooling and heating is described in @xcite in detail .",
    "the structure of the code is similar to that of @xcite , but the code has significantly improved over the years with additional input physics . it has been used for a variety of studies , including the evolution of the intergalactic medium @xcite , damped lyman-@xmath8 absorbers @xcite , and galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "our other simulations were done using the lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique .",
    "we use an updated version of @xcite , which uses an ` entropy conserving ' formulation @xcite to mitigate problems with energy / entropy conservation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and overcooling .",
    "this code also uses a multiphase model of the interstellar medium to describe self - regulated star formation and a phenomenological model for galactic winds @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used to study the evolution of the cosmic sfr @xcite , damped lyman-@xmath8 absorbers @xcite , and galaxies at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted in the simulations are intended to be consistent with recent observational determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as summarized in table  [ table : simulation ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the global stellar mass density @xmath11 as a function of redshift .",
    "figure  1a compares the simulation results with the observations , and figure  1b compares the semi - analytic models with the observations .",

    "the result of the h&s model shown in both panels is simply the integral of their approximate formula for the sfr which will be given in equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) .    for recent epochs ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the computed results are within the range of the observational data .",
    "however , the important result here is that at @xmath18 , all the observational estimates ( both corrected and uncorrected estimates for the incompleteness of the survey ) are smaller than the simulation results by more than a factor of two .",
    "the early development of the stellar mass density is much faster in the simulations than is suggested by current observations . as we discuss in section  [ sec : sfr ] , the larger @xmath11 at @xmath4 originates from a higher sfr at @xmath19 which peaks at @xmath2 in both the tvd and sph simulations .",
    "such a star formation history implies that about 70% ( 50 , 30 , 15% ) of the total stellar mass density today must have been in place by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the contribution to @xmath22 from the star formation at @xmath23 is about 10% .",
    "we note that the data points of ( * ? ? ?",

    "* green square boxes ) correct for the incompleteness of their data by integrating the schechter fit with a faint - end slope of @xmath24 down to a fainter magnitude . for the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blue crosses ) data points , we have plotted the values for the smc extinction case ( which yields slightly larger @xmath11 values compared to the @xcite extinction ) , and the upper error bars are extended up to their ` maximum mass ' estimates . for the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* black filled triangles ) data points , we plotted the values for the mass limit of @xmath25 which yields largest @xmath11 estimates from their data .",
    "we also note that dust extinction is taken into account in the analyses by @xcite by allowing the extinction parameter to vary when fitting the broadband photometric measurements of each galaxy by the spectral energy distribution generated by a population synthesis model . @xcite",
    "adopt the calzetti extinction with @xmath26 when deriving the mean mass - to - light ratio from the rest - frame @xmath27 color .",
    "the scaling of the simulation results to the local estimate at @xmath16 leaves us with some concerns , because the relative value of @xmath11 does indeed depend on this scaling .",
    "however , some kind of normalization is necessary to compare the results of different numerical models on the same basis , because every numerical model has its input parameters , and what we would like to focus in this paper is the _ relative _ speed of the development of @xmath11 from high redshift to the present time .",
    "the two tvd simulations in fact yield different values of @xmath11 owing to cosmic variance and differences in the set of cosmological parameters adopted in the simulations : @xmath28 and 0.0052 for n864l22 and n768l25 , respectively .",
    "the normalization of @xmath11 at @xmath16 in figure  [ sfhistory.eps ] can be partially explained by the scaling of @xmath11 with the baryon mass density in the different simulations .",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath11 scales as @xmath29 from theoretical arguments , and @xcite found that the amount of cold gas and stars in their sph simulations follow @xmath30 .    using the cosmological parameters of the two tvd runs , the scaling @xmath31 gives the expected ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the actual corresponding ratio from the two simulations is @xmath33 , which is a reasonable agreement , given other uncertainties , such as cosmic variance .",
    "it is expected that the h&s model ( blue long - dashed line in figure  1 ) should yield the highest @xmath11 at @xmath14 , because it is intended to remove the effects of limited resolution and cosmic variance .",
    "since the results of n864l22 and n768l25 are not corrected for the limited box - size and resolution , it is natural that they lack the earliest star formation at @xmath34 , resulting in a lower @xmath11 at @xmath14 .",
    "this is also true of the sph g6 run which by itself can not resolve the entire starforming population at @xmath19 .",
    "also , a comparison of the n864l22 and n768l25 results gives an idea of the level of cosmic variance for a volume of @xmath35 , and the deviation of the sph g6 run from the h&s model is also a consequence of cosmic variance .",
    "figure  1b compares the results of h&s theoretical model , semi - analytic models of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and observations .",
    "the model shown for @xcite is the updated ` accelerated quiescent ' model which was also used in @xcite , and follows the merger tree down to halos with circular velocity @xmath36 .",
    "the result shown for @xcite is the original model used by @xcite and @xcite for the comparison to their observational data .",
    "recently @xcite updated their model to include a starburst mode of star formation , which gives a result close to that of galform .",
    "the results of the semi - analytic models are somewhat higher than the observational estimates , but within the upper limit of @xcite data point at @xmath14 .",
    "it is also clear that the predicted @xmath11 by the h&s model is higher than that of the two semi - analytic models by about a factor of two .",
    "the discrepancy between the models and observations increases at @xmath37 , and is significant at more than 1-@xmath38 .",
    "in figure  [ sfr.eps ] , we show the cosmic sfr density as a function of redshift .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the simulation results , and panel ( b ) shows the semi - analytic model results .",
    "the simulation results shown in this figure are extracted directly from the runs , without any further adjustments .",
    "the h&s model that is shown in both panels has an approximate form as @xmath40 where @xmath41 . for a @xmath0cdm universe with the star formation and feedback algorithm described by @xcite ,",
    "the parameters defining the sfr density take the values @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "see section  [ sec : conclusion ] for further discussion on this formula .",
    "the line types and data points are described in the caption .",
    "the observationally estimated ultra - violet ( uv ) luminosity densities @xmath45 have been converted into the sfr by @xmath46= 8.0\\times 10^{27 } sfr [ { m_{\\odot}}~{{\\rm yr}}^{-1}~{\\rm mpc}^{-3}]$ ] @xcite .",
    "the sfr data points are corrected for dust extinction according to a prescription similar to that of @xcite : we assume the highly uncertain extinction correction factors to be 1.3 ( @xmath47 ) and 4.0 ( @xmath48 ) , while @xcite used higher values 2.7 ( @xmath47 ) and 4.7 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "it is important to note that each data point has been derived under different assumptions , because the faint - end slope of the luminosity function of galaxies at high redshift is not well constrained and adopting a steeper slope and integrating down to fainter magnitudes would certainly yield a larger uv luminosity density . here",
    "we describe some of the high redshift data points .",
    "* open stars at @xmath49 ) derived their uv luminosity density by integrating the luminosity function with a faint - end slope of @xmath50 down to @xmath51 . for their data points , we read off the sfr from fig.9 , corrected to our flat-@xmath0 cosmology , and applied our extinction correction .",
    "* open triangles at @xmath52 ) integrated the schechter fit with a faint - end slope of @xmath50 down to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the characteristic uv luminosity of lbgs at @xmath4 .",
    "* open pentagon at @xmath55 ) integrated their schechter fit with @xmath56 in the magnitude range of @xmath57 .",
    "this integration range was chosen to match with the limiting magnitude of the @xmath58 sample by @xcite in terms of absolute magnitude , therefore it is expected from the shape of the luminosity function that the resultant uv luminosity density at @xmath59 is @xmath60 times of that at @xmath4 in the same absolute magnitude range , depending on the choice of cosmology and the integration range .",
    "for the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* inverted open triangles ) data points , we show their total uv luminosity density case where the luminosity function with a faint - end slope of @xmath61 is integrated down to @xmath51 .",
    "an important theoretical result here is that all the simulation results and the h&s model peak at @xmath15 , and not at lower redshifts , as is often found in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see panel ( b ) ) .",
    "observationally , it is an unsettled problem whether the sfr levels off at high - redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or still increases beyond @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite stress the importance of the cosmological surface dimming effect and argue that previous measurements have missed a significant fraction of the ultraviolet luminosity density of the universe at @xmath63 .",
    "the scatter in the data points at @xmath62 is still large , and it is not possible at this time to determine the trend in sfr at these redshifts .",
    "however , our point is a theoretical one , and does not depend on the distribution of data points as we detail in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in passing , we note that the absolute values of @xmath11 at @xmath16 computed by integrating the sfr curves shown in fig.2b are 0.0037 , 0.0031 , 0.0041 , and 0.0090 for the models by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the result of tvd n864l22 at @xmath64 is slightly higher than most of the observational data points and has two large bumps at @xmath65 and 2.0 .",
    "these two peaks presumably owe to major merger events taking place in the simulation , and are a consequence of cosmic variance in the relatively small box utilized .",
    "if we had utilized a larger box , then we would expect the curve to be smooth .",
    "clearly the box - size of @xmath66 is not large enough to accurately model the volume averaged quantities in the universe at @xmath64 .",
    "we have shown that two independent different types of numerical hydrodynamic simulations both predict that the cosmic star formation rate density should peak at @xmath15 , and that this relatively early peak in the sfr leads to a more rapid development of the stellar mass density than current observational estimates . when all the results are scaled to the local value at @xmath16 ,",
    "the stellar mass density at @xmath14 in the simulations is larger than observed values by more than a factor of two .",
    "we also showed in figure  1b that the semi - analytic models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite predict larger @xmath11 than current observational estimates , but within the upper error bar of the @xcite data point at @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the h&s model predicts higher @xmath11 than those semi - analytic models by about a factor of two at @xmath14 .",
    "this comes from the fact that both the simulations and h&s model has a peak of sfr at @xmath67 , whereas the semi - analytic models have a peak at @xmath12 .",
    "the high @xmath11 predicted by our simulations and the model of @xcite suggest that current observations are missing nearly half of the total stellar mass density in the universe at high redshifts .",
    "this missing stellar mass could be hidden in a population of red galaxies that have not been detected previously in the optical ground - based data .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite find such a population of red galaxies at @xmath63 in hdf - south that has a volume density half that of lbgs at @xmath14 and a stellar mass density comparable to that of lbgs .",
    "however , the data points by @xcite include this red galaxy population .",
    "therefore the cosmic variance might be a stronger cause for the underestimate of @xmath11 by the current observations .",
    "this is hinted by the absence of this red population in hdf - north .",
    "if these red populations are strongly clustered as suggested by @xcite , observations with small fields - of - view could easily miss them .",
    "the stellar mass density in the simulations and observations agree reasonably well at @xmath64 where the rate of increase is much slower than at higher redshift .",
    "in addition , the dust extinction correction may seriously underestimate the fraction of early star formation that is heavily obscured . if we only had optical uv observations of nearby starburst galaxies  rather than the full spectrum extending to the submillimeter",
    " we would greatly underestimate star formation in these systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "future studies of starforming galaxies in the far - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the _ spitzer space telescope _ , in the submillimeter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the millimeter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the _ atacama large millimeter array _ ( alma ) , and in x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ would enable us to constrain the nature of starburst galaxies better , and estimate the intrinsic sfr more accurately .",
    "it is reassuring that the two different sets of simulations , which use very different hydrodynamic methods ( i.e. eulerian tvd and sph ) , both give a star formation history that peaks at @xmath15 .",
    "as argued by @xcite this is to be expected , because the evolution of the cosmic sfr is driven mainly by a competition between gravity and the expansion of the universe , with a weaker dependence on the details of star formation and feedback .",
    "the form of equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) given in section  [ sec : sfr ] can be understood as follows . at high redshifts , when the cooling time is short , star formation is limited primarily by the gravitational growth of halos , which is independent of the dissipative gas dynamics .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath68 and the factor @xmath69 in the exponential of equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) are determined by the form of the matter power spectrum , and the description of star formation and feedback enter into @xmath70 only logarithmically . at low redshifts ,",
    "the supply of star forming gas is limited by the expansion rate of the universe , fixing the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "the explicit influence of the prescription for star formation and feedback is again subdominant and mainly affects the values of the normalization parameters @xmath8 and @xmath73 .    for these reasons ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) can be generalized straightforwardly to other cosmologies and to include other physics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , as shown in e.g. figure 6 of @xcite , the fact that the sfr density is regulated mainly by the competition between gravity and the expansion of the universe means that the peak in @xmath70 should lie at @xmath74 , unless an implausible value is adopted for the parameters governing star formation .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that the various sets of simulations should be consistent , with residual differences owing to details in the cosmology and , most important , cosmic variance and resolution limitations .",
    "we plan to investigate these issues in the future using the algorithms described here , as well as adaptive mesh refinement codes .    for now , the agreement between our different numerical approaches supports the general arguments made by hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) , that the sfr density should peak at @xmath15 , mostly independent of the details of star formation and feedback .",
    "as we have demonstrated here , such an early peak in the cosmic star formation history yields @xmath11 that clearly exceeds current observational estimates and the results of semi - analytic models , suggesting that most of the stars in the universe at @xmath19 are `` missing . ''",
