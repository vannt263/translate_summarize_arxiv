    "strange matter , a deconfined state of quark matter consisting of almost equal amounts of up , down , and strange quarks , has been speculated to be the absolute ground state of hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "if true , nucleons and nuclei  and thus most of the luminous matter in the universe  is in a long - lived metastable state .",
    "undoubtedly , the confirmation of such hypothesis would have far reaching consequences on a variety of fields , ranging from astronomy and cosmology all the way to particle and nuclear physics .",
    "stimulated by such an exciting possibility , searches for strange matter are currently being conducted at terrestrial laboratories as well as at space - based observatories .",
    "indeed , a substantial effort has been devoted on experimental searches for strangelets ( `` strange - matter nuggets '' ) at both cern and brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and more are proposed in the future for the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large - hadronic collider ( lhc ) .",
    "these terrestrial experiments are being complemented by observational searches for strange stars .",
    "what would be the signature for such exotic objects ?",
    "since strange stars are self - bound objects having a mass - radius relation quite different than the gravitationally bound neutron stars , they are allowed rotational periods considerably shorter than those predicted for gravitationally bound stars .",
    "_ consequently , if a pulsar with a period falling below the limit of gravitationally bound stars were discovered , the conclusion that the confined hadronic phase of nucleons and nuclei is only metastable would be virtually inescapable  @xcite .",
    "_    such a pulsar may have been recently discovered  @xcite .",
    "the pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 , with a rotation period of 2.5  ms , is the fastest spinning x - ray pulsar ever observed .",
    "based on a study of its mass - radius relation it has been concluded that sax j1808.4 - 3658 is a likely strange - star candidate  @xcite , although this interpretation remains controversial  @xcite .",
    "still , the discovery of such a fastly - rotating pulsar appears to have made the detection of strange matter within observational reach . in turn",
    ", the confirmation of such an exotic state of matter will help settle the claim that at present our universe is in a long - lived metastable  state .    in the present work we focus on the impact of strangeness on the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "one motivation for this study , in addition to those mentioned earlier , is the observation that the masses of about 20 neutron stars are remarkably close to the `` canonical '' value of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "yet conventional models of nuclear structure , with equation of states constrained from the bulk properties of nuclear matter , seem to allow substantially larger masses  @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of a quark - matter phase at the core of neutron stars ( ns ) will soften considerably the equation of state leading to smaller limiting masses .",
    "thus a study of the strangeness content of hadronic matter , using a `` qcd - inspired '' model , is desirable .",
    "for static and spherically symmetric neutron stars obeying the oppenheimer - volkoff equations the only physical ingredient that remains to be specified is the equation of state .",
    "yet an equation of state that is accurate over the whole range of densities present in a neutron star remains a formidable challenge .",
    "for example , such an equation of state should be able to describe the hypothetical `` hybrid stars '' : neutron stars consisting of a quark - matter core below a nuclear - matter mantle .",
    "unfortunately , traditional studies of strange matter has been conducted in two vastly different pictures  @xcite .",
    "one picture uses a hadronic model  similar to ordinary nuclei  where the fundamental degrees of freedom are mesons and baryons .",
    "the other picture uses a quark model consisting of massless , noninteracting quarks confined inside a bag .",
    "presumably a description of strange matter in terms of mesons and baryons is well motivated in the low - density regime where clustering correlations remain important . at the same time , strange matter viewed as a relativistic fermi gas of quark might be appropriate at the extremes of densities necessary for color deconfinement to occur .",
    "yet this division seems ad - hoc and arbitrary ; for example , at what density should one switch from a nuclear- to quark - based description ? perhaps the most serious difficulty encountered in modeling the density dependence of hadronic matter and the resulting eos is how to model a system that has quarks confined inside color - neutral hadrons at low density but free quarks at high density .",
    "much of the responsibility for such complexity rests on the self - interactions among the gluons which generate quark confinement in the low - density regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the quark substructure of the hadrons should become important as the density increases .",
    "although the evidence in support of qcd as the correct theory of the strong interactions is overwhelming , at present no rigorous solution of qcd exists in the regime of high - baryon density .",
    "thus , one must resort to qcd - inspired phenomenological models .",
    "such models of hadronic matter using quarks as the underlying degrees of freedom have been developed to reproduce some properties of qcd  @xcite .",
    "the main feature of these models  generically known as `` string - flip '' models  @xcite  is the existence of a many - body potential able to confine quarks within color - singlet clusters without generating unphysical long - range van der waals forces  @xcite .",
    "the many - body potential is evaluated by solving a difficult optimization problem ; one must decide how to assign colored quarks into color - singlet clusters ( see below ) .",
    "presumably , this `` quark - assignment '' problem is meant to represent the optimal configuration of gluonic strings .",
    "while the precise form of the potential is presently unknown , the many - quark problem is likely to require solving some complicated global optimization problem .",
    "although string - flip models violate important symmetries of qcd , such as chiral symmetry and lorentz invariance , they excel in places where most other models fail : the transition from nuclear to quark - matter . in the string - flip moedl",
    "this transition is dynamical without the need to rely on ad - hoc parameters .",
    "hence , such models should shed light on the possibility of stable strange matter .",
    "that the emergence of strange quarks at high - baryon density is energetically favorable is easy to understand . as the density of the system increases , the pauli exclusion principle forces the chemical potential to increase from the light - quark mass @xmath1 to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fermi momentum .",
    "what is not easy to understand are the details of the transition .",
    "for example , do clustering correlations remain important at the transition density or has the system evaporated into the free quarks ?",
    "does the eos predicted by the model yield self - bound and absolutely stable strange stars ?",
    "these are the sort of questions that we plan to address in this paper .",
    "an initial study of strange matter in the string - flip model was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "a highly simplified version of the model was used to simulate one - dimensional matter in terms of two - color , two - flavor ( `` up '' and `` strange '' ) constituent quarks .",
    "while it was found that clustering correlations remain important in the transition region , strange matter was found to be unbound . in this paper",
    "we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite by simulating three - flavor ( up , down , and strange ) , three - color ( `` red '' , `` blue '' , and `` green '' ) hadronic matter in three - dimensional space .",
    "a variety of ground - state observables are computed as a function of density with the goal of characterizing the transition to strange matter and to establish the possibility of absolute stability .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows : sec .",
    "[ formalism ] introduces the general ideas used to model a system of fermions focusing on the structure of the wave function and the many - body potential .",
    "we then consider both the low- and high - density limits to establish closed - form baseline results . after describing the variational monte carlo procedure ,",
    "results are presented for a variety of ground - state observables .",
    "finally , we offer conclusions and perspectives for future work in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the qcd - inspired phenomenology prescribes how to model the many - quark potential . at very - low density",
    "the quarks must be confined within color - singlet clusters that should interact weakly due to the short - range nature of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "this suggests a strong  indeed confining  force between quarks in the same cluster but no further interaction between quarks in different clusters .",
    "thus , the force saturates within each color - singlet hadron .",
    "this saturatation is necessary in order for the hadrons to be able to separate without generating unphysical long - range forces .",
    "in contrast , in the high - density domain asymptotic freedom demands that the interaction between all quarks be weak .",
    "this behavior is expected once the average inter - quark separation becomes smaller than the typical confining scale . in this regime",
    "the only important correlation among quarks will be induced by the pauli exclusion principle and the system should evolve into a fermi gas of quarks .",
    "a many - quark potential that meets these requirements was first introduced by lenz and collaborators  @xcite to model meson - meson interactions . soon after the potential was adapted by horowitz , moniz , and negele for the study of one - dimensional nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "several more realistic generalizations have followed  @xcite , although all limited to non - strange matter .",
    "it is on one of these models  @xcite that we base our present generalization to strange matter .",
    "the model is constructed from quarks having flavor ( _ up , down , strange _ ) and color ( _ red , blue , green _ ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the many - quark potential is defined as the optimal clustering of quarks into color - singlet objects . for reasons that will become clear later",
    ", the implementation of this idea is carried out as follows .",
    "consider all red and blue quarks in the system , irrespective of flavor in accordance to the `` flavor - blind '' nature of qcd .",
    "we define the `` optimal pairing '' of red and blue quarks as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the spatial coordinate of the _ ith _ red quark and @xmath6 is the coordinate of the mapped _",
    "ith _ blue quark ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "note that the minimization procedure is over all possible @xmath8 permutations of the @xmath9 blue quarks and that the confining potential @xmath10 is assumed harmonic with a spring constant denoted by @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure0 ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath12 the `` blue - green '' and `` green - red '' components of the many - quark potential are defined in direct analogy to eq .",
    "( [ vrb ] )    @xmath13    in this manner the many - quark potential to be used in our simulations of strange matter becomes equal to : @xmath14    and thus , the hamiltonian describing the system of @xmath15 particles each with mass @xmath16 and momentum @xmath17 is given by :    @xmath18    several comments are now in order .",
    "first , the constructed potential is able to confine quarks within color - singlet clusters . yet",
    "the strong confining force saturates within each color - singlet cluster allowing the clusters to separate without generating long - range van der waals forces .",
    "moreover , the potential is symmetric under the exchange of identical quarks .",
    "second , the potential is truly many - body as moving one single quark might cause many of the `` strings '' to flip ; note that even those strings that are not connected to the moving quark might flip .",
    "third , although at very low density quarks will overwhelmingly belong to three - quark clusters , there is no guarantee that this will remain true at higher densities ; color - singlet clusters may also be formed from 6- , 9- , @xmath19 3a - quark configurations ( see fig",
    ".  [ figure0 ] ) .",
    "finally , the dynamically - induced residual interaction between color - singlet clusters will be generated exclusively through quark exchange , which induces a weak intermediate - range attraction between clusters , and the pauli exclusion principle between quarks , which generates a strong short - range repulsion .    as discussed early in this section ,",
    "the strict demands imposed by qcd on phenomenological models justifies the introduction of such a complex many - body potential . while its exact functional form remains uncertain , the requirements of quark confinement and cluster separability are likely to depend on solving some type of quark assignment problem . for simulations involving a large number of quarks",
    "an efficient clustering algorithm is of utmost importance . indeed , finding the optimal clustering of @xmath20 quarks into @xmath9 color - singlet objects requires searching among @xmath21 configurations . even for a modest system containing only @xmath22 hadrons",
    "the number of possible configurations already exceeds ten trillion ! clearly , a `` brute - force '' algorithm is impractical .",
    "moreover , `` three - dimensional stable matching problems '' , such as the three - quark assignment problem , have been shown to be np - complete  @xcite .",
    "thus , an efficient algorithm is unlikely to exist .",
    "but for the version of the string - flip model adopted in this work  where the clustering of quarks within color - singlet objects is done pairwise  an efficient algorithm exists in the hungarian method for the weighted bipartite matching problem which finds the optimal pairing in a time proportional to @xmath23  @xcite . note",
    "that while in this case the number of possible configurations grows``only '' as @xmath8 , a brute - force algorithm remains impractical .",
    "thus , without such an efficient algorithm our simulations would be limited to a very small number of quarks .",
    "we are interested in describing the evolution of the system with baryon density . for that purpose",
    "we use a variational monte - carlo approach based on a one - parameter wave function of the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the variational parameter , @xmath26 is the many - body potential defined in eq .  ( [ mqpotential ] ) , and @xmath27 is the fermi - gas wave function .",
    "this choice is motivated by qcd which dictates that at low density , when the average inter - quark separation is much larger than the confining scale , quarks should cluster into three - quark color - singlet hadrons .",
    "thus , in the low - density regime the potential between quarks in the same hadron is strong but , as the interaction saturates within each cluster , the residual interaction between hadrons is very weak .",
    "hence , the system resembles a fermi gas of weakly interacting hadrons .",
    "it is the exponential term in the variational wave function that becomes responsible for inducing the clustering correlations .",
    "in contrast , in the high - density limit , characterized now by an average inter - quark separation much smaller than the confining scale , asymptotic freedom should take over . in this regime",
    "the interactions between quarks are weak and the system `` dissolves '' into a free fermi gas of quarks . as will be shown below , the variational parameter evolves from a large ( isolated - cluster ) value at low density all the way to zero at high density , as the only remaining correlations between quarks are those induced by the pauli exclusion principle .      to describe a non - interacting system of quarks a fermi - gas wave function , given in the form of a slater determinant ,",
    "is used for each color - flavor combination of quarks .",
    "each of these slater determinants is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents a single - particle eigenstate for a free particle in a box with quantum numbers @xmath30 ( see below ) .",
    "this construction ensures that the wave function is totally antisymmetric under the exchange of identical quarks . to determine the single - particle wave functions we consider a single quark of mass @xmath31 confined to a three - dimensional box of side @xmath31 with antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the energy of each single particle state is characterized by three integer quantum numbers @xmath32 : @xmath33 note that throughout this work we employ units in which @xmath34 .",
    "each energy value , however , is at least eight - fold degenerate because there are even and odd solutions of the schrdinger equation in each of the three spatial dimensions .",
    "thus , a typical basis state is of the form : @xmath35 in this way the system develops a `` shell structure '' with each shell holding , at least , eight quarks of each color - flavor combination .",
    "let us illustrate how the shells are filled as the single - particle energy increases .",
    "expressing the single - particle energies in units of @xmath36 , the lowest shell has an energy of @xmath37 @xmath38 and is exactly eight - fold degenerate .",
    "the next shell , with an energy of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 and permutations ) holds 24 quarks , and so on ( for more details see table  [ table1 ] ) .      in the low - density regime quarks",
    "are confined within weakly - interacting color - singlet ( _ red+blue+green = white _ ) clusters .",
    "further , although the model allows the existence of multi - quark configurations , the probability that color - singlet clusters with more than three quarks are formed is vanishingly small  @xcite .",
    "finally , at these low densities the onset of strangeness is hindered by the large strange - quark mass .",
    "thus , in this limit the variational wave function is exact , as we now show .",
    "consider a nucleon as a nonrelativistic system of three quarks of mass @xmath1 interacting via a confining potential assumed harmonic of spring constant @xmath11 @xmath41 this is perhaps the simplest version of the surprisingly successful nonrelativistic quark model  @xcite .",
    "introducing center - of - mass and two relative coordinates    @xmath42    [ jacobi ]    enables one to rewrite the above hamiltonian as a system of two uncoupled harmonic oscillators : @xmath43 the ground - state properties for the system are now easily inferred .",
    "for example , the energy per quark is given by @xmath44 where the arrow in the above expression is meant to represent the value of the energy in units in which @xmath45 ; this system of units is adopted henceforth .",
    "further , up to an overall normalization factor , the ground - state wave function is also easily computed ; it is given by @xmath46 where the oscillator - length parameter @xmath47 has been introduced .",
    "note that we have used the fact that the above exponent is proportional to the potential energy of the baryon [ see eq .",
    "( [ hjacobi ] ) ] to write the second expression for the ground - state wave function .",
    "this expression suggests that in the limit of very low density the variational wave function defined in eq .",
    "( [ psivar ] ) becomes exact provided : @xmath48 note that in the low - density limit the fermi - gas component of the wave function is not important , as the average separation between quarks of the same color - flavor combination is much larger than the `` pauli hole '' .",
    "the variational wave function is also exact in the limit of very high density . in this asymptotically - free regime",
    "the interaction between quarks is negligible so the only remaining correlations among them are those generated by the pauli - exclusion principle .",
    "thus , the system is described by a fermi - gas wave function which represents the @xmath49 limit of the variational wave function given in eq .",
    "( [ psivar ] ) .",
    "a fermi - gas description is useful in establishing a baseline against which more sophisticated models may be compared .",
    "in addition , all observables that will be presented here can be computed analytically in the fermi - gas limit .",
    "hence let us start by computing the transition density to strange matter .",
    "this critical density is obtained by requiring that the chemical potential for the light ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) quarks be identical to the strange - quark mass ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath53 note that we have adopted a value of @xmath54 for the heavy - to - light mass ratio . adopting a constituent light - quark mass of @xmath55  mev ,",
    "the transition density in physical units corresponds ( with @xmath56 ) to @xmath57 note that spin degrees of freedom , or spin - dependent interactions , have yet to be included in the model .",
    "let us proceed to evaluate the equation of state and the strangeness - to - baryon ratio as a function of density .",
    "first , however , we introduce the following definitions : @xmath58 in terms of these relations the fermi momenta become @xmath59 moreover , the total energy - per - particle of the system  at fixed density ( @xmath60 ) and strangeness - per - quark ( @xmath61 )  may now be easily computed .",
    "we obtain @xmath62 the strangeness - per - quark is now determined by demanding that the total energy of the system be minimized at fixed density .",
    "that is , @xmath63        -    \\left[m+\\frac{k_{f}^{2}}{2m}(1-\\sigma)^{2/3}\\right ]       = 0 \\;.   \\label{dtfg}\\ ] ] this equation reflects the condition for chemical equilibrium : the chemical potential for both species of quarks ( light and heavy ) must be equal . in particular , at @xmath64 , which corresponds to the onset of the transition to strange - quark matter , one recovers the critical density computed in eq .",
    "( [ kfcrit ] ) .    another useful observable to characterize the transition to quark matter is the two - body correlation function  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( and @xmath67 ) denotes the collection of all internal quantum numbers , such as color and flavor .",
    "the two - body correlation function measures the probability that two given quarks be separated by a distance @xmath68 . in the fermi - gas limit , where the ground - state wave function may be written as a slater determinant",
    ", the two - body correlation function may be readily evaluated .",
    "we obtain , @xmath69 where the spherical bessel function is given by @xmath70 note that @xmath71 has been normalized to one at large distances .",
    "moreover , the correlation function between two quarks of the same flavor develops a `` hole '' at the origin as a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "yet the pauli suppression is not complete [ @xmath72 because in our model quarks of the same flavor carry an additional color quantum number .",
    "the variational nature of the simulation suggests that the expectation value of the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonv ] ) , will have to be minimized with respect to the variational parameter @xmath25 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ psivar ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath73 note that the expectation value of the energy as a function of @xmath25 will have to be computed for all densities and for a variety of strangeness - to - baryon ratios .",
    "the computational demands imposed on such a calculation are formidable , indeed .",
    "yet , the structure of the variational wave function entails some simplifications .",
    "for example , the expectation value of the kinetic - energy operator may be simplified through an integration by parts .",
    "that is , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the kinetic energy of a ( @xmath76 ) free fermi gas and @xmath77 reflects the increase in the kinetic energy of the system relative to the fermi - gas estimate due to clustering correlations .",
    "it is given by @xmath78 where the sum is over all quarks in the system and @xmath79 represents the average position of the two quarks connected to the @xmath80 quark .",
    "note that in the limit that only three - quark clusters are formed and @xmath81 , such as in the low - density limit , then @xmath82 . now using eq .",
    "( [ tlambda ] ) we obtain the following simple form for the expectation value of the total energy of the system : @xmath83 this form is particularly simple because the two functions that remain to be evaluated ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) are local ; thus , their expectation values may be easily computed via monte - carlo methods .",
    "to do so we use the well - know metropolis method  @xcite .    the metropolis algorithm is based on a markov process that generates events ( or configurations ) stochastically .",
    "the markov chain is created sequentially from knowledge of only the current configuration .",
    "that is , the @xmath86 configuration in the chain is generated stochastically using only the @xmath87 configuration ; no information about the @xmath88 event is required at all .",
    "we illustrate briefly the method with the evaluation of the expectation value of the potential energy @xmath89 although in writing this expression we have assumed a normalized wave function , it is not necessary for the wave function to be normalized when implementing the metropolis algorithm .",
    "note that for a system of @xmath90  quarks , as we have used in some of our simulation , computing the above expectation value requires the evaluation of a 360-dimensional integral !",
    "the metropolis algorithm ensures that the desired probability distribution , @xmath91 in our case , is approached asymptotically .",
    "the main idea of the method is not to evaluate the integrand at every one of the quadrature points , an impossible task indeed , but rather at only a relatively small representative sampling  @xcite .",
    "that is , the expectation value of the potential energy becomes @xmath92 where the sequence of @xmath52 configurations are distributed according to @xmath91 .",
    "as a test of the formalism and to illustrate how the variational approach becomes exact in the low- and high - density limits , we display in figs .",
    "[ ela0 ] and  [ cluster ] the ground - state energy of the system and its two - body correlation function , respectively .",
    "all simulations performed in this work were done using 120 quarks . at very - low density",
    "the system resembles a non - interacting gas of nucleons with an energy - per - nucleon and variational parameter identical to the single - nucleon values given in sec .",
    "[ ldl ] . that this is indeed the case",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ ela0 ] . here",
    "the kinetic , potential , and total energy of the system are plotted as a function of the variational parameter for a density of @xmath93 .",
    "( note that the light - quark rest mass has been subtracted out ) .",
    "as in the case of an isolated nucleon , the plot reflects the competition between the kinetic energy , which tends to diffuse the wave function away from the origin ( favors a small value of @xmath25 ) and the potential energy , which attempts to concentrate the wave function at the origin ( favors a large value of @xmath25 ) .",
    "a compromise is reached , in accordance to the virial theorem , at the point at which the kinetic and potential energies are equal ; that is , at @xmath94 .    in the opposite high - density limit",
    "the system is expected to evolve into a collection of non - interacting quarks .",
    "thus , it should display no correlations other than those generated by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "a simple way to test this assertion is by computing the two - body correlation function between identical quarks .",
    "if the system has indeed evolved into a fermi gas of quarks , the two - body correlation function should become identical to the one given in eq .",

    "the outcome of such a calculation is one of the three curves shown in fig .",

    "[ ldl ] ) . in order to generate the remaining curves in the figure one must change the strangeness - to - quark ratio while maintaining the baryon density fixed .",
    "once a minimum in the energy is identified , the energy - per - quark , strangeness - to - quark ratio , and variational parameter for that particular value of the baryon density are determined .",

    "the behavior of this quantity with density is interesting as @xmath100 may be regarded as the length - scale for quark confinement . at very low densities",

    "this unexpected behavior was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the one - flavor model .",
    "eventually the system must make the transition into the fermi - gas domain ( @xmath49 ) ; this is accomplished through an abrupt drop at a quark density of about @xmath101 .",
    "this density represents the transition from three - quark clusters into multi - quark configurations  @xcite .",

    "the one - flavor calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite is reproduced with the filled circles .",
    "while the equation of state displays a minimum in the strange - quark matter domain , the minimum is local so the system becomes unstable against the break - up into isolated three - quark nucleons .",
    "however , flavor degeneracy stabilizes the strange - matter phase in these models .",
    "indeed , in both the two- ( diamonds ) and three - flavor ( triangles ) cases quark - matter is absolutely stable . note that at the point at which the variational parameter drops discontinuously ( see fig .",

    "a much more interesting change happens at a density of @xmath103 : a second minimum develops well inside the strange - matter phase .",
    "the evolution with density of this second minima is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ minco ] . while the competing ( large-@xmath61 ) minimum is shallow at the the lowest density shown in the figure , it becomes the absolute ground state of the system at the highest density .",
    "the change from shallow to deep is accompanied by a discontinuous phase transition . at higher densities",
    "the variational and theoretical results match as expected .",
    "because of its intrinsic interest as the possible ground state of hadronic matter as well as its relevance to the dynamics of neutron stars , strange - quark matter has been modeled directly in terms of its quark constituents . a three - flavor , three - color string - flip model that confines quarks within individual color - neutral clusters , yet allows the clusters to separate without generating unphysical long - range forces , was used to compute strange - matter observables .",
    "perhaps the greatest virtue of the model is that the transition from nuclear matter  where quarks are confined within color - singlet hadrons  to quark matter",
    " where quarks are free to roam through the simulation volume  is dynamical ; there is no need to introduce ad - hoc parameters to characterize the transition . indeed , at very low densities the quarks cluster dynamically into ( three - quark ) nucleons having properties identical to those in free space .",
    "as the density increases the clusters dissolve , again dynamically , into a uniform fermi gas of quarks .",
    "this is in contrast to most of the models available today that use either nucleon and hyperons , even at very high densities , or quarks in a bag as the fundamental degrees of freedom .    after testing our variational monte - carlo approach in the low- and high - density limits , where the approach becomes exact",
    ", we proceeded to compute the variational parameter , the equation of state , and the strangeness content of strange matter .",
    "we were able to identify two phase transitions in the model .",
    "the first one , previously reported in the one - flavor simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , is characterized by a transition from three- to multi - quark cluster configurations .",
    "the variational parameter , which is directly related to the length scale for quark confinement , jumps discontinuously at the transition .",
    "a transition to strange - matter was also identified at a higher density .",
    "the onset for the transition was delayed slightly relative to the predictions of a free fermi - gas estimate .",
    "much more interesting , however , was the development of an additional discontinuous phase transition well into the strange - matter domain .",
    "this phase transition was characterized by the competition between two ground states ; one with a low and one with a high strange - quark content .",
    "we should point out that the effect of clustering correlations remained important even at the highest transition density .",
    "also interesting was the behavior of the equation of state as a function of the flavor - content of hadronic matter . for a simplified one - flavor model strange matter saturates but",
    "is unstable against the break - up into isolated nucleons .",
    "yet as the flavor - content of the model was increased , strange matter became absolutely stable .",
    "it is too early to predict how far we will be able to push this model .",
    "ultimately , one would hope to compute a realistic equation of state that could be used as input in the computation of masses and radii of neutron stars . unfortunately , and in spite of the considerable effort devoted to this endeavor , several crucial refinements remain to be added .",
    "perhaps the most important one is related to the lack of binding in the low - density nuclear phase . in the most pristine form of the model quark exchange",
    "is the unique source of attraction .",
    "clearly , this is insufficient to bind nuclear matter . perhaps adding the missing physics associated with the long - range pionic tail might help solve this problem",
    "further , while the present version of the model incorporated flavor and color degrees of freedom for the first time , spin and spin - dependent interactions remain to be included . incorporating this extra degree of freedom in the calculations , while avoiding an over - proliferation of baryonic states , remains a difficult challenge .",
    "finally , it is unrealistic to expect that a non - relativistic description will remain valid in the high - density domain .",
    "this problem can be solved , at least in part , by using a relativistic form for the kinetic energy of a free fermi gas . in spite of all these challenges we believe that the string - flip model used here represents a sound starting point for the description of this complicated many - body system .",
    "in particular , we are convinced that ultimately some form of quark - assignment problem will have to be solved in order to account simultaneously for quark confinement and cluster separability .",
