    "recent theoretical and observational evidence suggests that the growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes at their centres are closely related phenomena ( magorrian et al . 1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . as accretion onto these black holes",
    "is believed to power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) jets , such agn activity is thus intricately linked to the process of galaxy formation and evolution . the notion of agn feedback through radio sources , where the agn jets heat up and expel the surrounding gas , has received particular attention in recent times for a number of reasons .",
    "jet heating of the intracluster gas ( icm ) decreases the rate of accretion onto the central black hole , until it is shut off completely .",
    "once the gas has had sufficient time to cool , the accretion can restart .",
    "although one can envisage a stable configuration in which the accretion rate and gas heating are balanced , outward transport of central gas by the jet ( e.g. basson & alexander 2003 ) implies that agn heating must be sporadic in order to keep some gas available for fuelling @xcite .",
    "even if all the fuel is carried away from the central regions , the agn jet can restart once this gas is replenished , for example via an interaction with another galaxy @xcite .",
    "such an interaction will eventually lead to an increase in the accretion rate and hence a re - launching of the radio jets .",
    "this inherent intermittency of the feedback process is confirmed by observations of rising radio bubbles @xcite and multiple radio lobe pairs in the same source ( venturi et  al .",
    "2004 ; giovannini et  al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the intermittency also provides a natural way of keeping the black hole and spheroid growth in step .",
    "furthermore , agn heating has also been invoked to explain the lack of star formation in the most massive galaxies ( the so - called cosmic downsizing ; e.g. croton et  al .",
    "2006 ) , and suppression of cooling flows in the cores of massive clusters @xcite .",
    "the questions of how long an average radio source spends in an active state , and the length of time between outbursts , are thus crucial to quantifying the importance of agn feedback . a number of methods have been employed in attempts to quantify these .",
    "the oldest and best - known of these invokes spectral ageing and lobe expansion speed arguments @xcite , yielding on - times of a few times @xmath1  years .",
    "simulations suggest the jets will be disrupted after times of the order of @xmath2  years ( tucker & david 1997 ; omma & binney 2004 ) ; while energy injection rates required to quench cooling flows point to timescales of the order of few times @xmath1- few times @xmath2  years @xcite . observations of revived radio relic sources @xcite constrain the time between outbursts to around @xmath3  years .",
    "the local radio loud fraction of a few percent ( e.g. best et  al",
    ". 2005b ) also suggests the radio sources spend an order of magnitude longer in their quiescent state than in the active state .",
    "radio source evolution depends strongly on both the enviroment of the radio source , and jet characteristics @xcite .",
    "recently , best et  al . have found a strong dependence of the local ( @xmath0 ) radio loud agn fraction on the stellar mass of the host galaxy . in other words",
    ", it appears that the radio jets get retriggered more frequently in massive hosts . best et  al .",
    "( 2005a , b ) also investigated the relationship between radio and emission line agn activity by splitting their radio - optical sample into agns and star - forming galaxies according to the diagnostics appropriate for each case , and found that these are different phenomena .",
    "this finding is confirmed by studies of radio and emission line agn activity in the brightest group and cluster galaxies @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate these intriguing results in more detail by employing a flux- and volume - limited sample of radio sources with host properties .",
    "much like best et  al . , we combine optical information available from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 2 @xcite with two radio surveys , nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et  al . 1998 ) and faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm ( first ; becker et  al .",
    "1995 ) to construct a local ( @xmath0 ) radio - optical sample . unlike previous works ,",
    "which are only flux - limited , however , our sample is both volume- and flux - limited at both the radio and optical ( r - band ) wavelengths .",
    "we also use a combination of the first and nvss 1.4  ghz fluxes , ensuring sensitivity to both compact and diffuse structures .",
    "as the main focus of this work is on radio agn activity , we split our sample into agns and star - forming galaxies according to the radio diagnostic , and construct the bivariate radio - optical luminosity function by further dividing the agn subsample in stellar mass .",
    "radio source models are then used to fit individual source sizes and luminosities ( as derived from the first and nvss catalogues ) and derive the typical length of the active phase as a function of stellar mass . observed bivariate luminosity functions then set the time a radio source spends in a quiescent state .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] we describe our volume- and flux - limited sample .",
    "separation into agns and star - forming galaxies , as well as the resultant radio and bivariate luminosity functions , are discussed in section  [ sec : rlf ] .",
    "section  [ sec : radiosourcemodel ] outlines our radio source model , and the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our findings in the context of agn fuelling mechanisms in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume the cosmological parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "the sample used in this work was obtained by cross - correlating the optical sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 2 @xcite with two very large array ( vla ) radio surveys at 1.4  ghz , the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et  al .",
    "1998 ) , and faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ( first ; becker et  al . 1995 ) .",
    "the sdss catalogue used here derives from the volume - limited ( @xmath8 ) sample described by nikolic et  al . .",
    "the sample covers a spectroscopic area of 2627 deg@xmath9 on the sky and is optically complete , containing 44,630 galaxies with petrosian r - band magnitude @xmath10 . for a complete description of the sample and various derived optical parameters the reader",
    "is referred to nikolic et  al . .",
    "the two radio surveys used in constructing our radio - optical sample complement each other , in the sense that nvss is more sensitive to diffuse sources , but provides less accurate position estimates ( resolution of @xmath11  arcsec compared to @xmath12  arcsec for first ) .",
    "the process of pairing the radio and optical catalogues by comparing celestial positions of individual objects was performed using the catalogue utilities for reporting , selecting and arithmetic ( cursa ) software package produced by the starlink project .",
    "each of the radio surveys was independently paired with sdss , and the resultant catalogues then paired together to eliminate any duplicates .",
    "crucial to the pairing process is the separation distance within which two identifications are assumed to correspond to the same object .",
    "two different methods were employed to address this issue . in the first method",
    ", we followed ivezi et  al . and performed the pairing process at various separations , ranging from 1 - 40 arcsec for first / sdss , and 1 - 60 arcsec for nvss / sdss .",
    "the number of matches was plotted as a function of separation distance , and the point at which the number of matches stays approximately unchanged for any further increase in separation distance was taken as the best pairing distance estimate .",
    "this yielded a separation distance of 3  arcsec for first / sdss , and 12 - 15  arcsec for nvss / sdss .",
    "the second method involved generating a mock catalogue by offsetting all sources in the sdss catalogue by 4 _ arcmin _ in right ascention .",
    "both the mock and the actual sdss catalogues were then paired with first and nvss for a range of separation distances . at the largest separation distance",
    ", we expect all real matches to be captured , plus an unknown number of false matches ( due to the allowed separation distance being too large ) .",
    "an approximate number of real matches was obtained by subtracting the number of total matches for the real catalogue from the corresponding value for the mock catalogue .",
    "the summary of `` true '' and `` false '' matches thus obtained is given as a function of separation distance in table  [ tab : cataloguematching ] .",
    "the optimum separation distance yields the highest possible completeness rate ( given by the fraction of real matches out of all matches ) , and lowest contamination ( fraction of false matches ) .",
    "we thus chose separation distances of 5  arcsec for the first / sdss pairing process ( giving 2448 matches ) , and 15  arcsec for nvss / sdss ( giving 2393 matches ) .",
    "the two catalogues thus obtained were paired together with a separation distance of 0.1 arcsec , the level of sdss coordinate accuracy . there were 1427 sources common to both catalogues ; 1021 first / sdss objects did not have nvss / sdss counterparts , while 966 nvss / sdss sources were without corresponding identifications in the first / sdss catalogue .     &",
    "real matches & completeness & false matches & contamination + 1.5 arcsec & 2243 & 87.7% & 0 & 0% + 3 arcsec & 2391 & 93.4% & 2 & 0% + 5 arcsec & 2448 & 95.7% & 13 & 0.5% + 10 arcsec & 2553 & 99.8% & 77 & 3.0% + 20 arcsec & 2814 & 100% & 289 & 11.3% + 30 arcsec & 3221 & 100% & 651 & 25.4% + 40 arcsec & 3745 & 100% & 1186 & 46.3% +   + * nvss / sdss * & & & & + & real matches & completeness & false matches & contamination + 5 arcsec & 1205 & 43.5% & 15 & 1.2% + 10 arcsec & 2001 & 72.2% & 62 & 3.1% + 12 arcsec & 2200 & 79.4% & 81 & 3.7% + 15 arcsec & 2393 & 86.3% & 119 & 5.0% + 20 arcsec & 2656 & 95.8% & 202 & 7.6% + 40 arcsec & 3600 & 100% & 880 & 24.4% + 60 arcsec & 4799 & 100% & 2027 & 42.2% +    there are two reasons for this . first covers less of the sky than nvss , meaning some nvss / sdss sources will not have a corresponding first / sdss match .",
    "the rest of the mismatches come about due to the differences in sensitivity , positional accuracy and resolution of the two radio surveys .",
    "for example , first has higher resolution , which means nearby sources confused in nvss are often resolved in first .",
    "conversely , diffuse radio structures with no bright central core are not picked up by first , but appear in nvss .",
    "all the mismatches in areas of the sky common to first and nvss were therefore examined visually , and eventually all of these were included in the catalogue , yielding 3110 sources of nvss / first / sdss detections in the volume @xmath8 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^ , < \" , ]      best et  al . ( 2005b ) considered the relation between emission line and radio agn activity in their sample in two ways .",
    "first , they looked at the distribution of [ o ] luminosities as a function of radio luminosity , and found there to be no correlation between the two quantities for their ( mostly low @xmath13 ) sample ( their fig .",
    "secondly , best et  al .",
    "compared the radio loud agn fractions as a function of stellar mass in emission line and optically inactive agns , finding no significant difference between the two ( their fig .",
    "these findings suggest that whether or not a given object is classified as an emission line agn or a normal galaxy has no bearing on how likely it is to host a radio agn .",
    "an identical analysis of our sample confirmed these results .    using radio source models",
    ", we extend this analysis to investigation of the radio jet power dependence on [ o ] line luminosity , as shown in figure  [ fig : qjetvsloiii ] .",
    "line luminosity for the radio agn subsample .",
    "the rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) relation is shown by a dashed line.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the [ o ] luminosity probes the narrow - line region , and is thus indicative of the agn bolometric luminosity .",
    "no correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath15}$ ] is observed in the largely low radio luminosity sample presented here . by constrast , using spectral ages to estimate jet powers , rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) found a tight relation between narrow - line optical luminosity and jet power in powerful radio sources ; this is shown in figure  [ fig : qjetvsloiii ] by a dashed line .",
    "the fact that no such correlation exists for low luminosity radio sources confirms the claim of best et  al . that radio and optical agn activity are distinct phenomena in these objects .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that these correspond to different accretion states . in this picture ,",
    "powerful radio jets would be fuelled when the accretion disk is in a radiatively inefficient , low luminosity state ; while optical agn are detected when the disk is radiatively efficient and correspondingly the jet power is low @xcite .",
    "the distribution of sources in the p - d plane can also be used to place constraints on radio source ages .",
    "figure  [ fig : observedsizespd ] shows the observed distribution for each @xmath16 bin . also plotted",
    "are p - d tracks for @xmath17 using the parameters of section  [ sec : parameterspace ] and the derived distribution of jet powers given in table  [ tab : derivedparameters ] .",
    "curves corresponding to source ages of @xmath2 and @xmath18  years are given for guidance ; these are the dotted , almost vertical , lines .",
    "finally , limits on the maximum detectable size of a source with given luminosity and redshift are plotted as straight coloured lines in log - log space .",
    "very dim extended sources , such as radio relics , would fall below these limits .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : selectioneffects ] , these are largely missed by the pairing process employed in constructing the present catalogue . however , since in this work the emphasis is on the currently active radio sources , this selection effect does not alter the analysis .",
    "more importantly , figure  [ fig : observedsizespd ] shows that there are no resolved sources ( i.e. those sources whose positions are well - defined in the p - d plane ) close to the nvss detection threshold ( green line ) .",
    "thus it is unlikely that a significant number of large radio sources is missed .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : observedsizespd ] shows that although large ( and hence old ) sources are found in all mass bins , the median source size is smaller in lower mass bins .",
    "figure  [ fig : fractileton ] quantifies this statement by using the derived source ages and once again plotting the fractile ranges .",
    "unresolved sources pose a problem for this approach , since only upper limits on their sizes are available .",
    "we assume that all unresolved sources have very small sizes and are thus younger than the smallest resolved sources . while crude , this assumption is sufficiently accurate for the highest stellar mass bins , where the unresolved number counts are low , and there are many sources larger than the upper unresolved limit .",
    "however , no meaningful information can be extracted for @xmath19 .",
    "much like jet powers , the derived source ages appear to depend strongly on stellar mass , with the most massive galaxies hosting older sources . using the median @xmath20 values ( table  [ tab : derivedparameters ] ) we find @xmath21 .",
    "duration of the quiescent phase @xmath22 is found from the bivariate luminosity function .",
    "figure  [ fig : fittedblfs ] plots the best fits to the observed rlf for each stellar mass bin",
    ". parameters of sections  [ sec : parameterspace ] and  [ sec : sourcesizes ] , and jet powers given in table  [ tab : derivedparameters ] , are adopted .",
    "the only adjustable parameters are the jet on and off times .    as discussed in section  [ sec : parameterspace ] , it is difficult to constrain the active phase duration from the radio luminosity function alone .",
    "however , the rlfs are very sensitive to the ratio @xmath23 . therefore , combining @xmath20 estimates from observed source sizes with constraints on the duty cycle from the luminosity functions yields @xmath22 values for each @xmath16 bin .",
    "these are given in table  [ tab : derivedparameters ] , where @xmath20 is calculated from the median values of table  [ tab : derivedparameters ] by assuming that a typical radio source with a given stellar mass will be active for @xmath24 , i.e. it is observed halfway through its evolution .",
    "it is important to consider how reliable the timescales derived in the preceding section are .",
    "the ratio @xmath25 ratio is largely set by the radio loud fraction in each bin ( see section  [ sec : parameterspace ] ) , and hence uncertainties in this quantity are comparable with poisson errors in the corresponding luminosity function",
    ". these are clearly negligible in comparison with variability in parameters such as the density profile , jet power and cocoon axial ratio , all of which are important for individual source age determination .",
    "the dynamical model of kaiser & alexander relates the size of a source expanding in a power - law atmosphere with exponent @xmath26 to its age @xmath27 and various cocoon and icm parameters via    @xmath28    here , the cocoon axial ratio @xmath29 is inversely proportional to jet opening angle @xmath30 . for the majority of our sample we do not expect @xmath30 to vary by more than a factor of two , and as @xmath31",
    "we do not expect the axial ratio to affect our source age determinations by more than about a factor of two also .    neglecting relativistic electron energy loss processes ( adiabatic and radiative ) , kaiser et  al .",
    "model gives @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the power - law exponent of the electron energy distribution .",
    "rearranging yields    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in deriving individual source jet powers in section  [ sec : sourcesizes ] we had to assume a density profile .",
    "however , from equation  [ eqn : sourcesize ] it is clear that source size does not depend on @xmath37 or the density profile individually , but instead the combination @xmath38 . by knowing both the source radio luminosity and size , and using equations  [ eqn : sourcesize ] and [ eqn : lradio ] we arrive at @xmath39 .",
    "taking @xmath40 gives @xmath41 and @xmath42 , yielding @xmath43 .",
    "hence even an uncertainty of an order of magnitude in @xmath44 will alter the derived timescale by only a factor of a few .",
    "we can thus conclude that our @xmath20 estimates are likely to be correct to within a factor of two or so .",
    "as the uncertainty associated with the ratio @xmath25 is much less than this , duration of the quiescent timescale is also expected to be similarly accurate .",
    "best et  al . found a strong dependence of the radio loud fraction on black hole and host galaxy mass , @xmath45 .",
    "we find a similar result for our volume - limited sample ( figure  [ fig : blf ] ) , with @xmath46 .",
    "for a fixed spheroid - to - total light ratio ( section  [ sec : jetpowers ] ) , using the @xmath47 relation @xcite gives @xmath48 .",
    "best et  al .",
    "point out that this relation is similar to the @xmath49 gas cooling rate dependence on black hole mass derived from the x - ray - optical correlation in luminous elliptical galaxies , and suggest that agn radio activity might be fuelled by the cooling of hot gas within the host galaxy .",
    "the derived agn `` on '' timescales in table  [ tab : derivedparameters ] clearly increase with stellar mass .",
    "if the agn is fuelled by cool gas accretion , and the duration of the active phase is limited by fuel availability , one would expect for constant radiative and accretion efficiency @xmath50 , which on using the scaling relations of section  [ sec : jetpowers ] gives @xmath51 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath21 derived in section  [ sec : ton ] , and suggests that the duration of the active phase may indeed be determined by the availability of fuel to `` feed '' the jets .",
    "the quiescent phase duration ( table  [ tab : derivedparameters ] ) also shows a strong dependence on @xmath16 , with sources hosted by the most massive galaxies spending a shorter amount of time in the off phase , consistent with higher cooling rates in those objects . in the absence of a heating source",
    "one would expect @xmath52 .",
    "however , in practice as the more massive galaxies host the more powerful radio sources , they will be more affected by the heating and cold gas uplifting than their lower mass counterparts , and the observed relation is not as steep .",
    "we constructed a flux- and volume - limited ( @xmath0 ) sample of radio sources with optical identifications by cross correlating the sdss optical survey with 1.4 ghz nvss and first surveys .",
    "source sizes and luminosities together with radio source models allowed us to derive jet powers and ages of individual sources , and hence the jet `` on '' time as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the bivariate luminosity function was then used to constrain the time a typical radio source spends in an inactive state .",
    "radio and emission line agn activity are found to be independent phenomena .",
    "we also find that both the radio source lifetime and duration of the quiescent phase have a strong mass dependence , with massive hosts harbouring longer - lived sources that are triggered more frequently .",
    "gas cooling rate shows a similar mass dependence , suggesting that fuel depletion is the reason the jets switch off .",
    "we thank the commonwealth cambridge trust ( ss ) and the isaac newton trust ( ss and sa ) for support , and the anonymous referee for comments that have helped improve the paper .",
