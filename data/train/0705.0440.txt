    "the observed global properties of the universe can be remarkably well described by the @xmath8cdm model in conjunction with simple initial conditions for the primordial density fluctuation spectrum . in its simplest form",
    "the model is geometrically flat and represented by nontrivial values for six key parameters : the baryon density , the dark matter density , the hubble parameter , the amplitude and spectral index of primordial adiabatic scalar fluctuations , and the optical depth to reionisation .",
    "no single additional parameter provides a substantially better fit to currently available data , a situation summarised by max tegmark s dictum , `` vanilla rules ok '' @xcite .",
    "there are however many ways to extend this vanilla model , some of which are physically well - motivated , such as a nontrivial equation of state @xmath9 for the dark energy , or a running spectral index for the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "an extension with a nonvanishing hot dark matter component is actually unavoidable because neutrinos are known to have mass and the current direct laboratory limits are so loose that neutrino hot dark matter could easily play an important role .",
    "many authors have sought to constrain neutrino masses in the context of @xmath8cdm cosmology by inference from cosmological data , and found no evidence for a nonvanishing value on the level of precision that can be achieved with existing data .",
    "another extension invokes a nonstandard radiation density , traditionally parameterised by the effective number @xmath0 of neutrino species , with @xmath1 being the standard value @xcite",
    ". this tradition dates back to the time before lep at cern measured the number of ordinary neutrino species to be  3 and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provided the only significant upper limit on the number of particle families . today , constraining @xmath0 with cosmological data is primarily a consistency test of standard particle physics with concordance cosmology and of concordance cosmology with itself because one can compare the radiation density allowed by bbn with that implied by precision cosmological data which probe physics at different epochs .",
    "this exercise has been performed by several groups before @xcite and after  @xcite the release of the wmap 3-year data @xcite .",
    "some of these recent results suggest surprisingly large values for @xmath0 , with 95% c.l .",
    "intervals that do not always include the standard value @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the apparent conflict of these results and the exciting possibility of a deviation from the minimal cosmology has motivated us to re - examine the cosmological @xmath0 determination .",
    "our goals are two - fold : first , to identify the source of discrepancy in previous analyses , and second , to provide an up - to - date estimation of @xmath0 within more general model frameworks .",
    "one possible source for the overestimation of @xmath0 is an incorrect statistical methodology .",
    "the popular software getdist , an analysis package frequently used in conjunction with the monte carlo markov chain generator cosmomc @xcite for cosmological parameter estimation , provides by default 1d error estimates based on the central rather than the minimal credible interval , although the latter is more meaningful for inference problems .",
    "these constructions differ significantly for skewed distributions , but become identical in the gaussian limit .",
    "we find that this effect can indeed be significant if one uses a small number of data sets that are not very constraining , since in these cases the 1d marginal posterior distribution for @xmath0 often has a long tail towards large @xmath0 values as a result of strong degeneracies with other parameters .",
    "however , when many data sets are combined and conspire to remove these degeneracies , the 1d posterior for @xmath0 usually becomes narrow enough to approach the gaussian limit .",
    "therefore the different error construction methods are probably not the main source of discrepancy .",
    "the two main problems we have identified that affect the determination of @xmath0 are ( i ) an unusually large fluctuation amplitude reconstructed from the lyman-@xmath3 forest data @xcite relative to that inferred from wmap , and ( ii ) the treatment of scale - dependent biasing in the galaxy power spectrum inferred from the main galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey data release 2 ( sdss - dr2 ) @xcite . the first issue is well known , and its complete investigation  involving elaborate astrophysical modelling  is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the second issue is more subtle . in previous analyses , scale - dependent biasing in sdss - dr2",
    "has either been ignored @xcite , or treated with empirical correction formulae under overly restrictive conditions @xcite .",
    "we will explain this issue in more detail in section  [ sec : bias ] below .",
    "here we anticipate that no exotic values for @xmath0 will be found if one either avoids small - scale data altogether or if one avoids artificially constraining assumptions about the extent of the scale dependence .    to derive our estimate for @xmath0 we begin in section  [ sec : models ] with a description of our cosmological parameter framework , and in section  [ sec : data ] the cosmological data to be used . in section  [ sec : bias ]",
    "we discuss the problem of galaxy bias and its scale dependence . in section  [ sec : inference ]",
    "we compare different statistical inference methods frequently encountered in the context of cosmological parameter estimation , and the way they provide `` best - fit parameters '' and associated error estimates . in section  [ sec : minimal ] we study @xmath0 in a minimal cosmological model which has a nonstandard radiation density as the only extension to vanilla cosmology .",
    "we use this simple scenario as a benchmark to compare results from different combinations of data and with different statistical methods . in section  [ sec : extended ] we consider an extended model that includes as free parameters also a constant dark energy equation of state parameter , a running spectral index , and neutrino masses . in the framework of standard bayesian statistics we provide credible intervals for @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarise our findings .",
    "we perform our inference in the framework of a cosmological model with vanishing spatial curvature and described by eleven free parameters , @xmath10 here , the physical dark matter density @xmath11 , the baryon density @xmath12 , the hubble parameter @xmath13 , the optical depth to reionisation @xmath14 , the amplitude @xmath15 , and the spectral index @xmath16 of the primordial scalar power spectrum are collectively labelled the `` vanilla '' parameters .",
    "they represent the simplest parameter set necessary for a consistent interpretation of currently available data .",
    "the next three parameters denote a nonzero neutrino fraction @xmath17 of the present day dark matter content , the number @xmath18 of massive neutrino species , assuming a common mass value @xmath19 for all of them , and the total effective number @xmath0 of massless plus massive neutrinos . of course",
    ", @xmath0 can also include other forms of radiation . with these definitions",
    ", @xmath18 enters the present - day energy density as @xmath20 during the radiation - domination epoch the total energy density is @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the photon and neutrino temperatures respectively .",
    "the last two parameters in equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) represent a constant equation of state parameter for the dark energy @xmath6 , and a running parameter @xmath24 in the scalar power spectrum defined at the pivot scale @xmath25 .",
    "the vanilla cosmological model is defined by holding all non - vanilla parameters fixed at their standard values given in table  [ tab : priors ] . in the same table",
    "we also show the priors assumed for all cosmological fit parameters .",
    "we shall consider several scenarios , each including @xmath0 as a free parameter .",
    "our minimal model ( section  [ sec : minimal ] ) has seven free parameters , namely , vanilla+@xmath0 , while the other parameters are fixed at their standard values .",
    "in particular , all neutrinos are assumed to be massless .",
    "most constraints on @xmath26 in the recent literature were derived within this framework @xcite .",
    "therefore , the minimal model lends itself as a benchmark case to the study of differences and similarities between our results and those of previous authors , as well as differences between different analysis methods .      as in the minimal model , our extended models",
    "( section  [ sec : extended ] ) always include the vanilla parameters and @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we include neutrino masses and hence the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "extended models with @xmath27 as a free parameter were also considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , there are many different ways to incorporate neutrino masses into the analysis .",
    "we shall consider two scenarios .",
    "in the first , we assume that all degrees of freedom represented by @xmath26 have equal mass @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath28 . an increased effective number density of ordinary neutrinos could be due to , for example , a chemical potential in the neutrino phase space .",
    "a second way to include neutrino masses , to be denoted @xmath29 , is to fix @xmath30 , i.e. , the standard density of ordinary neutrinos , each with a mass @xmath19 , is guaranteed .",
    "the remaining @xmath31 species are massless degrees of freedom that truly represent radiation ; we do not assume anything about its physical nature . the prior @xmath32 will be used in this case .    in both cases",
    "we consider also more elaborate scenarios in which @xmath6 and @xmath24 are treated as free parameters , motivated by the well - known degeneracies between @xmath0 and @xmath27 @xcite , and between @xmath0 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "studying these larger models and comparing them with simpler ones illustrates how well combinations of different data sets can break these degeneracies .",
    "we use cmb data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment after three years of observation @xcite .",
    "the data analysis is performed using version 2 of the likelihood calculation package provided by the wmap team on the lambda homepage @xcite .",
    "the large scale matter power spectrum has been inferred from the galaxy clustering data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2df )  @xcite . in particular , the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) sample from the recent sdss data release  5 ( dr5 ) supersedes all previous power spectrum measurements in terms of statistical significance  @xcite .",
    "however , the `` old '' spectrum retrieved from the sdss main galaxy sample from data release  2 ( sdss - dr2 ) @xcite is still drawing attention , primarily because the parameter estimates inferred therefrom appear to be in conflict with those derived from other probes .",
    "we shall therefore analyse this data set as well . as it turns out , the apparent discrepancy can be explained in terms of scale - dependent bias ( section  [ sec : bias ] ) .",
    "the baryon acoustic oscillations peak has been measured in the sdss luminous red galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "we use all 20  points in the two - point correlation data set supplied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the analysis procedure described therein , including power spectrum dewiggling , nonlinear corrections with the halofit package  @xcite , corrections for redshift - space distortion , and analytic marginalisation over the normalisation of the correlation function . except for the last marginalisation ,",
    "these corrections are applied largely for cosmetic reasons ; we obtain essentially the same results even without them .",
    "we use the luminosity distance measurements of distant type  ia supernovae provided by davis et  al .",
    "this sample is a compilation of supernovae measured by the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite , the essence project @xcite , and the hubble space telescope @xcite , as well as a set of 45 nearby supernovae . in total",
    "the sample contains 192 supernovae .",
    "in some cases we use the direct measurement of the hubble parameter from the hst key project , @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the flux power spectrum of the lyman-@xmath3 forest has been used to reconstruct the matter power spectrum on small scales at large redshifts . by far the largest sample of spectra",
    "comes from the sdss survey .",
    "this data set was carefully analysed in mcdonald et  al .",
    "@xcite and used to constrain the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the derived linear fluctuation amplitude at @xmath34 and @xmath35 is @xmath36 , and the effective spectral index @xmath37 .",
    "these results were derived using a very elaborate model of the local intergalactic medium in conjunction with hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "while the ly@xmath3 data provides in principle a very powerful probe of the fluctuation amplitude on small scales , the question remains as to the level of systematic uncertainty in the result .",
    "the same data has been reanalysed by seljak et  al .",
    "@xcite and viel et  al .",
    "@xcite , with somewhat different results . specifically , the normalisation found in refs .",
    "@xcite is lower than that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we shall use the default ly@xmath3 module provided in the cosmomc package in some parts of our analysis .",
    "this module uses the sdss - ly@xmath3 data based on mcdonald et  al .",
    "@xcite , and does not support the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath6 and @xmath24 in our extended models ( it does support @xmath0 , however ) . therefore",
    ", the ly@xmath3 data will be analysed only in the context of the minimal model .",
    "we stress that our ly@xmath3 results would likely be somewhat different if the viel et  al .",
    "analysis of sdss - ly@xmath3 had been used . however",
    ", when all available cosmological data sets are used in combination , the ly@xmath3 data carries relatively little weight in the combined fit for @xmath0 and is not crucial for our conclusions .",
    "the conventional wisdom behind using galaxy survey data to infer the underlying matter distribution is that , on sufficiently large scales , the galaxy power spectrum @xmath38 traces that of the total matter content @xmath39 calculated from linear theory up to a constant , scale - independent bias factor , @xmath40 this relation is of course not exact , and its region of applicability limited . on sufficiently small scales we expect nonlinear evolution to cause its breakdown .",
    "one obvious source for correction is the nonlinear growth of the underlying matter density field on scales @xmath41 .",
    "another is the violation of scale independence for the galaxy bias .",
    "the latter arises from the fact that galaxy formation takes place preferentially in dark matter halos with certain optimal masses , which are themselves biased tracers of the matter distribution  @xcite .",
    "indeed , depending on the galaxy morphology , theoretical modelling and numerical simulations suggest that the galaxy bias can deviate markedly from scale independence already at nominally linear scales @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the problem this presents to cosmological parameter estimation is immediate : power spectrum measurements on scales in the vicinity of @xmath43 carry substantial weight in statistical inferences because of their small formal error bars .",
    "improper handling of the galaxy bias will therefore likely yield misleading results , a point we discuss in more detail below .",
    "unfortunately , neither theoretical modelling nor simulations are as yet able to accurately predict the galaxy bias and its scale dependence . in the meantime",
    ", we have the option to either ( i )  cut the data at a suitably small @xmath44 , usually @xmath45 , or , if we want to use more data points , ( ii )  introduce some fitting formula that models crudely the effect of a scale - dependent bias and then marginalise over the associated nuisance parameters .",
    "for the latter approach and in the framework of @xmath8cdm cosmologies , ref .",
    "@xcite suggests the formula @xmath46 where @xmath47 is fixed , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are free parameters to be marginalised . while the issue of bias correction was not explored in the parameter estimation analysis of sdss - dr2  @xcite , both options ( i ) and ( ii ) were considered in the context of the vanilla model by the 2df  @xcite and the sdss - dr5  @xcite teams in their respective analyses .",
    "both analyses found that , after marginalisation over @xmath49 , additional data beyond @xmath50 in option  ( ii ) lead to no significant deviation in the cosmological parameter estimates or improvement in the errors compared to those obtained with the simpler option  ( i ) .",
    "conversely , if we ignore the issue of scale - dependent bias and adhere strictly to the relation ( [ eq : constantbias ] ) , then it has been shown that the 2df - inferred @xmath51 tends towards higher values with increasing @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "more strikingly , analyses of the sdss - dr5 data show that the best - fit @xmath51 values inferred on scales @xmath52 and @xmath53 differ by 2@xmath54 under the constant bias assumption  ( [ eq : constantbias ] )  @xcite . significant scale dependence in the galaxy bias has been put forward to explain the apparent tension between the galaxy power spectra measured by 2df and sdss , the latter of which tends to select the more strongly - biased red galaxies @xcite . for the purpose of constraining a possible nonstandard radiation density",
    ", we note that the well - known degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath51 means that any inference of @xmath0 will be highly sensitive to how we handle the bias issue , a point also raised in ref .",
    "we consider both a conservative and a more speculative approach .",
    "in the conservative approach , we use power spectrum data only on scales that are safely linear ,    * 2df - lin , @xmath55 ( 17 bands ) , * sdss - dr2-lin , @xmath56 ( 11 bands ) , and * sdss - lrg - lin from dr5 , @xmath57 ( 11 bands ) .",
    "the combined set of these data is denoted lss - lin .",
    "we adopt the constant bias assumption ( [ eq : constantbias ] ) for each data set , and marginalise over each of the three bias parameters @xmath58 with a flat prior .      in the speculative approach ,",
    "we use data sets collectively denoted as lss - q that include    * 2df - q , @xmath59 ( 32 bands ) , * sdss - dr2-q , @xmath60 ( 14 bands ) , and * sdss - lrg - q from dr5 , @xmath61 ( 20 bands ) ,    with @xmath44 values chosen to conform with the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . here",
    ", we use the bias correction formula ( [ eq : fittingformula ] ) and marginalise over each set of @xmath58 and @xmath49 with flat priors . when fitting the 2df data .",
    "we point out that these numbers are in fact _ derived _ from the 2df data itself @xcite .",
    "we feel it is inconsistent to feed them back into a fit as a prior . ]",
    "our motivation for caution in this case owes itself to the fact that the formula ( [ eq : fittingformula ] ) was originally developed and calibrated for @xmath8cdm cosmologies ; there is _ a priori _ no guarantee that it would apply also to nonstandard models .",
    "we note that seljak et  al .",
    "@xcite and mangano et  al .",
    "@xcite also used the bias correction formula ( [ eq : fittingformula ] ) on the sdss - dr2 data .",
    "however , they adopted a gaussian prior on @xmath49 of @xmath62 that is predetermined from numerical simulations .",
    "as we shall see , this choice tends to bias their results towards large values of @xmath0 .",
    "we believe this is the main origin of the discrepant @xmath0 values reported by different groups .",
    "we use standard bayesian inference techniques , and explore the model parameter space with monte carlo markov chains ( mcmc ) generated using the publicly available cosmomc package  @xcite .    given a set of data @xmath63 , a direct probabilistic interpretation for the degree of belief in the parameters @xmath64 of an assumed underlying model",
    "is given by the posterior probability distribution @xmath65 here , the likelihood function @xmath66 quantifies the agreement of the data with an assumed set of parameter values , while the prior probability @xmath67 represents our belief in what the true parameter values should be before any data is taken .",
    "this inherent subjectivity of bayesian inference is a point of much criticism .",
    "a pragmatic approach is to employ uniform priors and `` let the data decide '' . however , this approach is not entirely free of subjectivity , particularly when it comes to credible interval construction and marginalisation ( section  [ sec : marge ] ) .",
    "the posterior probability @xmath68 serves as the starting point for any further inference . a natural point of reference",
    "is the posterior mode @xmath69,\\ ] ] representing the most probable parameter values given the data and priors .",
    "note that we sometimes refer to the posterior mode as the `` best - fit '' , although strictly speaking the term refers to those parameter values that maximise the likelihood and is equivalent to @xmath70 only for uniform priors .",
    "another commonly used point estimate is the posterior mean or `` expectation value '' @xmath71 for one - dimensional distributions , one may also define the median @xmath72 , where 50% of the posterior s volume lie on either side .",
    "in addition to point estimates one needs credible regions in parameter space that express the degree of uncertainty in the inference .",
    "a closed but not necessarily connected hypersurface @xmath73 , called a @xmath74% credible region , can be constructed such that the hypervolume @xmath75 contains a fraction @xmath76 of the total volume beneath @xmath68 , @xmath77 this definition is not unique . in the 1d case ,",
    "two popular choices are    * _ central credible interval ( cci)_the credible interval @xmath78 $ ] means that equal fractions @xmath79 of the posterior s volume lie in @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the cci is always connected and contains the median @xmath72 . *",
    "_ minimum credible interval ( mci)_for a unimodal distribution , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are chosen to minimise @xmath84 .",
    "this amounts to placing @xmath78 $ ] around the peak of the posterior . in general",
    "the posterior may be multimodal , and the mci is constructed such that the posterior at any point inside is larger than that at any point outside .",
    "the mci need not be connected , but always includes the mode @xmath85 .",
    "these constructions coincide only under special circumstances , e.g. , if the posterior probability is gaussian with respect to @xmath86 .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ fig : intervals ] show realistic examples of a cci and an mci that are very different .",
    "which of these constructions should we adopt ?",
    "since our goal is to find the most probable set of parameter values , we believe that the mci is more adequate because it singles out regions of parameter space with the highest probability densities . in particular , the mci always includes the `` best - fit '' parameter ( more precisely , the mode ) .",
    "finally , for multidimensional posteriors , only the mci is uniquely defined .",
    "we discuss these matters in such detail because cosmomc s popular companion package getdist outputs for 1d intervals a cci , not an mci , a property that does not always seem to be recognised .",
    "moreover , under the default settings , getdist does not output the median @xmath72 , the point estimate naturally associated with the  cci , but rather the expectation value @xmath87 .     for our minimal model , the data set wmap+sdss - dr2-lin and top hat prior @xmath88 .",
    "the shaded regions are , from top to bottom , the bayesian 68% central credible interval , the 68% minimum credible interval , and the @xmath89 interval derived from maximisation .",
    "the dashed vertical lines mark , from top to bottom , the posterior mean @xmath90 , the 1d marginal posterior mode @xmath91 , and the global best  fit  @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig : intervals ] ]      for multi - parameter models typically encountered in cosmology , the information carried by the multi - dimensional hypersurface @xmath73 is often not useful in practice and must be `` compressed . ''",
    "it is common to map the posterior probability @xmath68 onto a lower - dimensional subspace by the process of marginalisation , @xmath93 where @xmath94 represents the parameters in the @xmath95-dimensional subspace .",
    "point estimates for @xmath96 and credible regions may then be constructed from the marginal posterior probability in analogy to section  [ sec : ci ] above .",
    "marginalisation favours regions of parameter space that contain a large volume of the probability density in the marginalised directions .",
    "this `` volume effect '' can sometimes lead to counter - intuitive results , such as suppression of the probability density for the global best fit parameters @xmath97 if they appear within sharp peaks or ridges that contain little volume .",
    "moreover , the concept of volume itself depends on the choice of parameters .",
    "for example , a flat prior on a parameter or one on its logarithm have completely different effects on the volume in that parameter direction .",
    "therefore , other methods of mapping the multi - dimensional posterior onto a lower - dimensional space can be useful .",
    "a complementary approach to marginalisation is to project @xmath98 onto the @xmath95-dimensional subspace @xmath99 by maximising along the remaining directions , @xmath100 the resulting @xmath95-dimensional profile posterior @xmath101 has the advantage of preserving the true peak of the original @xmath102-dimensional posterior probability and hence the global best fit  @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ fig : intervals ] shows a realistic example of a 1d marginal and a 1d profile posterior in juxtaposition .",
    "in addition , we introduce an effective chi - square measure for the goodness - of - fit relative to the global best fit , @xmath103.\\ ] ] for @xmath104 , we define loosely the `` @xmath105 '' and `` @xmath106 '' intervals as the 1d regions satisfying respectively @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we emphasise that these intervals have no formal probabilistic interpretation .",
    "however , they do provide a raw assessment , unplagued by volume effects , of how well a given parameter value agrees with the data relative to the global best fit , and have the virtue of being invariant under reparameterisation of the model . of course",
    ", if @xmath109 is gaussian , then the @xmath105 and @xmath106 intervals thus derived coincide with the 1d marginal 68% and 95% minimum and central credible regions  @xcite .",
    "maximisation was used in some recent studies of cosmological @xmath0 inference @xcite .    for simplicity our maximisation intervals",
    "are extracted from the same mcmc chains used to construct the bayesian credible intervals .",
    "however , we caution that mcmc techniques are strictly speaking not designed for this purpose ; there exist sophisticated optimisation methods such as simulated annealing that are much better suited to the task .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : intervals ] shows a realistic example of a one - dimensional @xmath105 interval constructed according to equation  ( [ eq : deltachi2 ] ) . for a very non - gaussian situation such as depicted in this figure , the point estimates and corresponding credible intervals derived by the methods discussed here",
    "are very different .",
    "to study the impact of different statistical methodologies and of different combinations of data sets , we use the minimal model ( i.e. , vanilla+@xmath0 ) as a benchmark case . each entry in table  [ table : modela ] gives a point estimate and the lower and upper ends of the appropriate 68% and 95% credible intervals for @xmath0 .",
    "the first column indicates the combinations of cosmological data sets . to illustrate the strong degeneracy between @xmath0 and the hubble parameter @xmath110 in some data sets and its consequences , we have used two different top - hat priors : the loose prior  1 ( @xmath111 ) and the more constraining prior  2 ( @xmath112 ) .    in the columns showing the bayesian central credible interval",
    ", we use the posterior mean @xmath113 as a point estimate , which is the default output of getdist .",

    "consider first the top half of table  [ table : modela ] . the posterior mean and the cci , i.e. , the default output of getdist , show a preference for large @xmath0 for almost all combinations of probes .",
    "the combinations wmap , wmap+sdss - dr2 , and wmap+snia , in particular , appear to disfavour the standard value @xmath117 at more than 68% ( prior  1 ) .",
    "however , any evidence for @xmath118 disappears as soon as we impose the tighter prior  2 on @xmath110 .",
    "this trend stems from the @xmath26-@xmath110-degeneracy which leads to a long tail of high @xmath0 in the 1d marginal posterior ( figure  [ fig : intervals ] ) .",
    "the tail in turn pushes the posterior mean and the cci to larger @xmath0 values . imposing a tighter prior on @xmath110 suppresses the tail and reduces this effect .",
    "in contrast , the 1d marginal posterior mode @xmath91 and the global best fit @xmath92 pick out the parameters with the highest probability densities , and turn out to be insensitive to the choice of @xmath110 prior . the tail region still has a strong impact on the upper mci limits , but the lower limits are relatively unaffected .",
    "the @xmath0 constraints from wmap in table [ table : modela ] provide an excellent illustration of this point .",
    "the @xmath105 and @xmath106 intervals from maximisation depend even less on the @xmath110 prior , since this construction makes no reference to the volume of the posterior and is therefore insensitive to tail regions once the 1d profile posterior drops below @xmath119 relative to the peak .",
    "as argued earlier ( section  [ sec : ci ] ) , in bayesian inference only the mci provides a meaningful answer to the question , what are the most probable values of @xmath0 implied by the data .",
    "our explicit examples show that inference based on the cci , the default output of getdist , can lead to incorrect conclusions .      turning to the issue of bias in the galaxy power spectrum ,",
    "we see in table  [ table : modela ] that the two different measures introduced in section  [ sec : bias ] to bypass or account for the scale dependence , namely , using only linear data at @xmath120 , or adopting the bias correction formula ( [ eq : fittingformula ] ) , generally produce consistent results .",
    "the agreement between wmap+sdss - dr2-lin and wmap+sdss - dr2-q , and between wmap+sdss - lrg - lin and wmap+sdss - lrg - q are excellent , suggesting that the effects of scale - dependent biasing have been successfully ameliorated .",
    "the wmap+2df - lin and wmap+2df - q results do show a slight discrepancy at roughly the 68% level .",

    "having identified and corrected the problematic issues , we now turn to our own @xmath0 estimates .",
    "an inspection of table  [ table : modela ] reveals that , except for those sets including ly@xmath3 , none of the combinations of probes shows any significant evidence for @xmath134 , a value that always sits comfortably within the 68% mci .",

    "( all - q+ly@xmath3+hst ) .",
    "[ fig : degeneracies],width=453 ]    the origin of ly@xmath3 s preference for large values of @xmath0 can be gleaned from figure  [ fig : degeneracies ] .",
    "the ly@xmath3 data prefer a much higher amplitude of density fluctuations at small scales , quantified by @xmath5 , than other data sets .",
    "this is particularly evident in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : degeneracies ] . the higher @xmath5 value required by ly@xmath3 forces @xmath0 upwards and cuts away the allowed region for low @xmath0 values .",
    "as can be seen in the same figure , with the inclusion of ly@xmath3 , the upper bound on @xmath0 comes mainly from the hst prior on @xmath141 .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath141 both control the epoch of matter  radiation equality and are thus strongly degenerate , a large @xmath0 can only be accommodated by a high value of @xmath141 . however",
    ", such high values are strongly disfavoured by the hst data .",
    "the overall shift in the allowed range for @xmath0 between wmap+ly@xmath3 and all - q+ly@xmath3 also points to the fact that the sdss - ly@xmath3 data is not completely compatible with other data sets ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a striking feature in table  [ table : modela ] is that when all data sets are combined , the three different statistical methods give almost identical results .",
    "the reason is that the combination of cmb , lss , and snia data effectively breaks all parameter degeneracies and yields a posterior distribution that is very close to gaussian , a limit in which all three methods must give the same result .",
    "the lower half of table  [ table : modela ] nicely confirms this expectation .",
    "we now consider constraints on @xmath0 in the context of extended models that allow also for nonvanishing neutrino masses . as in the case of the minimal model",
    ", we calculate the bounds within a conservative approach using only linear data ( all - lin ) , as well as a more speculative one that utilises the stronger , but more model - dependent all - q data set . since , as we saw in section  [ sec : minimal ] , @xmath0 exhibits a strong degeneracy with the hubble parameter @xmath141 in some data sets , we consider both options of including and excluding the hst data in our analysis .",
    "we do not use the ly@xmath3 data for the extended models .",
    "table  [ table : extended ] shows our constraints on @xmath26 for four choices of extended models : vanilla+@xmath0 extended with @xmath27 , @xmath27+@xmath24+@xmath6 , @xmath29 , and @xmath29+@xmath24+@xmath6 .    to      consider first the top half of table  [ table : extended ] .",
    "the two extended models have , respectively , vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath27 and vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath27+@xmath24+@xmath6 as free parameters . also in place is the condition , meaning that all @xmath0 neutrinos have equal masses @xmath19 . in both cases , it is evident that some new degeneracies have arisen with the introduction of additional free parameters ; the marginal posteriors for @xmath0 are not perfect gaussians for the all - lin and all - q data sets , as indicated by the fact that their associated credible intervals from different constructions do not exactly overlap . however ,",
    "none of the all - lin and all - q results show any significant deviation from the standard @xmath138 , and adding the hst data essentially serves to tighten the bounds .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the case of the smaller vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath27 model , adding the hst data brings the marginal posterior for @xmath0 much closer to the gaussian limit , so that the three different credible interval construction methods give almost identical results .",
    "our best estimate is @xmath142 ( all - q+hst ) , values that are somewhat larger than those found in the minimal vanilla+@xmath0 model for the same data set , @xmath137 , because of a degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath27 .",
    "for the even larger vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath27+@xmath24+@xmath6 model , an additional degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath6 comes into play so that the posterior for @xmath0 becomes more non - gaussian .",
    "for all - q+hst , for example , even though the mci and the cci have more or less converged ( thus indicating a symmetric marginal posterior ) , the limits from maximisation are still very different .",
    "as our formal bound we use the mci estimate for all - q+hst , @xmath143 , but also note that all three methods give credible intervals that are compatible with @xmath138 at better than 68% .",
    "thus , as was the case for the minimal model , there is no evidence for any nonstandard value of @xmath0 .",

    "some degeneracy persists between @xmath144 and @xmath0 , in contrast to earlier results from some of us @xcite .",
    "the difference can be traced to a generally more conservative approach taken in the present work , particularly with regard to scale - dependent biasing , as well as a different statistical methodology ( bayesian marginalisation vs maximisation ) .     and @xmath0 in the extended model vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath27+@xmath24+@xmath6 , using the data set all - q+hst .",
    "the corresponding contours for the model vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath29+@xmath24+@xmath6 are similar , but with a cut - off at @xmath145 . [",
    "fig : mnunnu],width=434 ]      the bottom half of table  [ table : extended ] shows constraints on @xmath0 for essentially the same two classes of models , vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath29 and vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath29+@xmath24+@xmath6 , except we now impose the condition @xmath146 , representing models with three massive neutrinos and @xmath147 massless species .",
    "this model is different from that presented above in section  [ sec : nm = neff ] because there is now a hard lower limit of @xmath145 .",
    "the presence of a hard limit can in principle lead to some very disparate credible intervals from the three different construction methods . in the present case ,",
    "however , the 1d marginal and profile posteriors for @xmath0 both peak at or very near the limit .",
    "it is therefore more useful to report , instead of a cci , an upper 100@xmath76% limit constructed by requiring that a fraction @xmath76 of the marginal posterior s volume lies to the left of the limit .",
    "this construction is also a default setting of getdist for parameter estimation in the presence of hard limits . for simplicity , however , we shall continue to label an interval thus constructed as a cci .",
    "the definitions of an mci and a maximisation interval are the same as before .",
    "the fact that the marginal posterior for @xmath0 peaks at or very near the hard limit also means that , although the posterior mean and mode still differ , the cci and the mci will coincide , as is clearly shown in the bottom half of table  [ table : extended ] . all estimates indicate that @xmath138 sits safely within the 68% region .",
    "our best estimate for the smaller vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath29 model , based on the mci , is @xmath148 ( all - q+hst ) , while for the larger vanilla+@xmath0+@xmath29+@xmath24+@xmath6 model we find @xmath149 using the same data set .",
    "motivated by several recent , seemingly conflicting inferences of the cosmic radiation density ( traditionally parameterised as the effective number of neutrino species @xmath0 ) from cosmological observations , we have re - examined the issue of cosmological @xmath0 determination in great detail and identified the reasons for the apparent discrepancies .    using a minimal model with @xmath0 as the only nonstandard parameter ( i.e. , vanilla+@xmath0 )",
    ", we find that the treatment of scale - dependent biasing in the galaxy power spectrum data is crucial to the derived value of @xmath0 . the very high values of @xmath0 found in refs .",
    "@xcite for the wmap+sdss - dr2+snia data and the same model can be traced to their treatment of the @xmath49 parameter which quantifies the level of bias correction .",
    "the prior on @xmath49 imposed in these studies , @xmath150 , is significantly more restrictive than the parameter space allowed by the wmap+sdss - dr2-q data . because of a degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath49 , such a restrictive prior cuts out much of the parameter region that favours low values of @xmath0 and consequently biases the inferred @xmath0 towards high values ( figure  [ fig : qn ] ) .",
    "the use of restrictive priors on @xmath49 is unjustified when fitting nonstandard cosmologies , unless the priors have been verified / supplemented by simulations or other means under _ the same _ model assumptions . in the absence of such information ,",
    "the best strategy is to use broad and uniform priors .",
    "when the wmap measurements are combined with any other single data set ( lss , bao , snia , or hst ) , we find that the inferred @xmath26 is always compatible with the standard value @xmath117 at 68% c.l .  or better , except for the combination wmap+ly@xmath3 , which yields a high @xmath0 value in disagreement with 3.046 at more than 95% .",
    "the reason ly@xmath3 prefers a high @xmath0 originates in a well - known discrepancy in the inferred small - scale fluctuation amplitude between the sdss - ly@xmath3 and the wmap data .",
    "this can be understood from our figure  [ fig : degeneracies ] .    when all data sets ( except ly@xmath3 ) are used in combination",
    ", we find tighter bounds on @xmath0 that are , again , compatible with @xmath138 at better than the 68% level .",
    "this finding is independent of whether we use galaxy power spectrum data only in the strictly linear regime or also at higher values of @xmath131 , as long as scale - dependent bias is correctly taken into account .",
    "when ly@xmath3 is added to the fit , the inferred @xmath0 is again shifted to higher values because of ly@xmath3 s normalisation discrepancy with wmap .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : lya ] this discrepancy is most likely due to unaccounted systematics in the ly@xmath3 data .",
    "for this reason we quote a result without ly@xmath3 , @xmath151 , as our best current estimate of the constraints on @xmath0 in the minimal vanilla+@xmath0 model from wmap+lss - q+bao+snia+hst .",
    "another very interesting point is that the statistical method used to construct credible intervals can have a strong impact on parameter inference when the posterior probability is non - gaussian .",
    "using an inappropriate interval construction can sometimes lead to incorrect inferences .",
    "this is especially true when fitting data sets that are not very constraining and therefore contain strong parameter degeneracies .",
    "however , when all available data sets are used in combination , they conspire to break each other s degeneracies .",
    "the 1d posterior for @xmath0 in the minimal model approaches the gaussian limit , and all three interval constructions used in our analysis , the bayesian central and minimum credible intervals , and the non - bayesian concept of maximisation , give almost identical results in this case .",
    "new parameter degeneracies arise when more free parameters are introduced in extended models . even when the parameter inference is performed with all data sets combined ,",
    "there is still some , albeit small , differences in the credible intervals obtained from the different methods .",
    "we have considered several different extended models in the present work , all including nonzero neutrino masses as a free parameter . while the formal constraints on @xmath0 differ slightly from model to model",
    ", we find again that @xmath117 is always compatible with data at the 68% c.l .  or better , as long as we exclude the ly@xmath3 data . because of the additional parameters the formal bounds on @xmath0 are somewhat relaxed relative to those derived for the minimal model . for our most general model ( i.e. , vanilla+@xmath26+@xmath27+@xmath24+@xmath6 , with @xmath0 equally massive neutrinos ) , we find @xmath143 , based on the minimum credible interval , using the data set wmap+lss - q+bao+snia+hst .",
    "we consider also the case in which the total radiation density is split into three massive species and @xmath152 strictly massless ones . in this case",
    "we find almost identical upper bounds on @xmath0 as in the previous case with @xmath0 massive species ( the lower bounds here are now always 3.0 ) .",
    "extra radiation density corresponding to at least one extra neutrino degree of freedom is allowed by all data sets at the 95% level .",
    "thus , cosmological observations are not yet at a precision level sufficient to exclude very light sterile neutrinos , axions , majorons , or similar particles that were in thermal equilibrium after the qcd phase transition . with future cmb and weak gravitational lensing data this situation",
    "is set to change .",
    "for instance , with data from planck and the future wide - field weak lensing survey lsst , a sensitivity of @xmath153 can be achieved  @xcite .",
