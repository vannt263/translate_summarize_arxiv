    "ngc 3079 is one of the nearby ( @xmath0 mpc ) edge - on spiral galaxies that have been studied extensively in different wavelengths .",
    "it is classified as seyfert 2 @xcite and shows evidence of starburst activity ( e.g ; * ? ? ?",
    "the galaxy is known for its several unique features , including an ionized gas outflow as a `` super - bubble '' @xcite .",
    "the outflows seem to originate from the nucleus and reach velocities up to @xmath1 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however the exact origin of this `` super - bubble '' feature is still ambiguous due to the difficulty to distinguish the role of the starburst from the agn .",
    "chandra x - ray observations also show a clear correspondence of x - ray filaments with h@xmath3 filaments extended @xmath4 pc from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "a nuclear jet outflow has also been observed in the radio continuum as two , kilo parsec - scale , radio lobes extending on both sides of the major axis of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these radio lobes are believed to be associated with the nuclear activity of the galaxy .",
    "+ it is interesting to note that ngc 3079 is found in a small group with two known small companion galaxies : ngc 3073 and mcg-917 - 9 .",
    "the optical appearance of both companions do not show any disturbance , however , in radio ngc 3073 seems to be affected by nuclear activity in ngc 3079 @xcite . due to the proximity of the galaxy , ngc 3079",
    ", all the interesting features can be studied glorious detail .",
    "neutral hydrogen was detected in both emission and absorption .",
    "the hi emission from ngc 3079 appears to be more complex than thought in previous studies , with a much more extended and highly asymmetric distribution ( see fig . [",
    "f : tothi ] ) .",
    "the hi disk also shows an asymmetric warp in the outer regions .",
    "a large stream of gas , encircling the entire galaxy was discovered , making an hi bridge between ngc 3079 and mcg 9 - 17 - 9 , which indicates interaction between the two galaxies .",
    "a new companion galaxy is also discovered taking part in the streaming gas around the galaxy .",
    "mcg 9 - 17 - 9 : this galaxy appears to have an interaction with ngc 3079 .",
    "the hi bridge between the two galaxies is evidence for this ( see fig .",
    "[ f : interaction ] ) , and it seems a gas tail which has been stripped off mcg 9 - 17 - 9 during the interaction . the x - ray halo of ngc 3079 is strong enough to be responsible for stripping off gas from mcg 9 - 17 - 9 . + ngc 3073 : interestingly enough , an extended hi tail was seen in ngc 3073 that is much longer than seen in previous observations with significant curvature ( see fig . [",
    "f : tothi ] ) . as suggested by @xcite the hi tail of this galaxy can be explained by ram pressure due to the supper - wind from ngc 3079 .",
    "while the wind ram pressure seems to be responsible for the cometary appearance of ngc 3073 , we have seen a drop in the surface brightness of ngc 3073 along the tail that can not be explained by a steady wind or constant density .",
    "perhaps temporal changes in the wind properties are responsible for this drop .     showing the hi bridge between mcg 9 - 17 - 9 and ngc 3079 to the right .",
    "the `` third tail '' feature is also shown to the left .",
    "contours are in steps of 2@xmath5.,width=302,height=226 ]      another interesting result ( although tentative ) obtained from our data is that the presence of a third galaxy that seems taking part in the interaction with ngc 3079 . an hi gas has been detected at the position of the optical galaxy sdss j100311.18 + 553557.6 ( no previous redshift was available ) at a velocity of 1050 km s@xmath2 . this hi gas exhibits a tail like structure forming a bridge toward ngc 3079 ( see fig [ f : interaction ] )",
    "our data show strong and broad ( over 600 km s@xmath2 ) hi absorption against the nuclear region of ngc 3079 .",
    "since the the absorption is unresolved at the highest resolution of our observation , one can only tell that it originates from the gas located in front of the inner 1 kpc of the radio continuum .",
    "the hi absorption spectra show multiple - component structure with a mixture of broad and narrow components .",
    "the deep part of the absorption covers the velocity range of the observed hi emission associated with the rotating disk ( see fig .",
    "[ f : absence ] ) .",
    "this component has been studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to this already known component , we report the tentative detection of a highly blueshifted , faint component of the absorption that reaches velocity up to 400 km s@xmath2 with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "this absorption is much broader than the rotation velocities observed in the galaxy and therefore it is likely associated with fast non - circular motions .",
    "blueshifted absorption has to be associated to an outflow .",
    "fast outflows of neutral gas have already been detected in other radio galaxies ( e.g ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other radio sources where such fast cold gas has been detected the most likely origin for the outflow is considered to be the interaction of the jet with a dense interstellar medium that surrounds the radio source . in case of ngc3079 , however , it is more complicated to find the origin for this fast outflow .",
    "both a starburst component as well as the agn can be responsible .",
