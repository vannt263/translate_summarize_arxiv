    "there is now an ongoing huge effort at the fermilab tevatron @xmath16 collider to extract a standard model higgs boson signal from a daunting set of sm background processes .",
    "while such an effort is to be lauded and if successful would complete the picture provided by the standard model ( sm) we note here that an even bigger prize may await in the form of the gluino of supersymmetric ( susy ) models@xcite .",
    "current searches from cdf and d0 collaborations have explored values of @xmath10 up to @xmath17 gev within the context of the minimal supergravity ( msugra or cmssm ) model@xcite . here , we show that tevatron experiments should with current data sets be able to expand their gluino search much further : into the 400 gev regime , in yukawa - unified susy , which is a model with arguably much higher motivation than msugra@xcite .",
    "since yukawa - unified susy favors a light gluino in the mass range @xmath18 gev , with the lower portion of this range giving the most impressive yukawa coupling unification@xcite , such a search would explore a huge swath of the expected model parameter space .",
    "supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) based upon the gauge group @xmath0 are extremely compelling@xcite . for one ,",
    "they explain the ad - hoc anomaly cancellation within the sm and @xmath19 theories .",
    "further , they unify all matter of a single generation into the 16-dimensional spinor representation @xmath20 , provided one adds to the set of supermultiplets a sm gauge singlet superfield @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is a generation index ) containing a right - handed neutrino . upon breaking of @xmath0 ,",
    "a superpotential term @xmath23 is induced which allows for a majorana neutrino mass @xmath24 which is necessary for implementing the see - saw mechanism for neutrino masses@xcite .",
    "in addition , in the simplest @xmath0 theories where the mssm higgs doublets reside in a 10 of @xmath0 , one expects @xmath1 yukawa coupling unification in addition to gauge coupling unification at scale @xmath25@xcite . in models with yukawa coupling textures and family symmetries",
    ", one only expects yukawa coupling unification for the third generation@xcite .    in spite of these impressive successes , guts and also susy guts",
    "have been beset with a variety of problems , most of them arising from implementing gut gauge symmetry breaking via large , unwieldy higgs representations .",
    "happily , in recent years physicists have learned that gut theories as formulated in spacetime dimensions greater than four can use extra - dimension compactification to break the gut symmetry instead@xcite .",
    "this is much in the spirit of string theory , where anyway one must pass from a 10 or 11 dimensional theory to a 4-d theory via some sort of compactification .",
    "regarding yukawa coupling unification in @xmath0 , our calculation begins with stipulating the @xmath4 and @xmath26 running masses at scale @xmath27 ( for two - loop running , we adopt the @xmath28 regularization scheme ) and the @xmath29-quark running mass at scale @xmath30 .",
    "the yukawa couplings are evolved to scale @xmath31 , where threshold corrections are implemented@xcite , as we pass from the sm effective theory to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) effective theory . from @xmath32 on to @xmath33 , yukawa coupling evolution is performed using two - loop mssm ( or mssm+rhn ) rges .",
    "thus , yukawa coupling unification ends up depending on the complete susy mass spectrum via the @xmath29 , @xmath4 and @xmath26 self - energy corrections .    in this work",
    ", we adopt the isajet 7.79 program for calculation of the susy mass spectrum and mixings@xcite .",
    "isajet uses full two - loop rg running for all gauge and yukawa couplings and soft susy breaking ( ssb ) terms . in running from @xmath33 down to @xmath34 ,",
    "the rg - improved 1-loop effective potential is minimized at an optimized scale choice @xmath35 , which accounts for leading two - loop terms . once a tree - level susy / higgs spectrum is calculated ,",
    "the complete 1-loop corrections are calculated for all susy / higgs particle masses .",
    "since the susy spectrum is not known at the beginning of the calculation , an iterative approach must be implemented , which stops when an appropriate convergence criterion is satisfied .",
    "yukawa coupling unification has been examined in a number of previous papers@xcite . the parameter space to be considered",
    "is given by m_16 ,  m_10 ,  m_d^2 ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  ,  sign ( ) [ eq : pspace ] along with the top quark mass , which we take to be @xmath36 gev@xcite .",

    "as in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model , @xmath42 is a common gut scale gaugino mass , @xmath43 is a common gut scale trilinear soft term , and the bilinear ssb term @xmath44 has been traded for the weak scale value of @xmath45 via the ewsb minimization conditions .",
    "the latter also determine the magnitude ( but not the sign ) of the superpotential higgs mass term @xmath46 .",

    "the hs prescription ends up working better than dt splitting@xcite .    in the case where the above conditions are satisfied , yukawa coupling unification to within a few percent can be achieved .",

    "mixed axion / axino dark matter occurs in models where the mssm is extended via the peccei - quinn ( pq ) solution to the strong @xmath65 problem@xcite .",
    "the pq solution introduces a spin-0 axion field into the model ; if the model is supersymmetric , then a spin-@xmath66 axino is also required .",

    "as lsp is that wimp search experiments will find null results , while a possible positive result might be found at relic axion search experiments@xcite .",
    "a more direct consequence of the yukawa - unified susy models is that the color - octet gluino particles are quite light , and possibly accessible to fermilab tevatron searches . under the assumption of gaugino mass unification , the lep2 chargino mass limit that @xmath68 gev normally implies that @xmath69 gev , quite beyond the tevatron reach",
    "however , in yukawa - unified susy , the trilinear soft breaking term is large : @xmath70 tev .",

    "the @xmath4 and @xmath26 yukawa couplings are large , while the top and bottom squark masses are much lighter than their first / second generation counterparts . as a consequence",
    ", gluino decays to third generation particles in particular decays to @xmath4 quarks are enhanced .",
    "in addition , gluino pair production via @xmath84 fusion is normally suppressed by @xmath29- and @xmath85-channel interferences in the production cross section . for @xmath86 tev",

    "recent studies of squark and gluino pair production at the fermilab tevatron collider , using data corresponding to @xmath95 fb@xmath9 of integrated luminosity and a beam energy of @xmath96 tev , have produced limits at the 95% cl that @xmath97 gev ( in the case of cdf@xcite ) , and @xmath98 gev ( in the case of d0@xcite ) .",

    "we adopt a common first / second generation squark mass of @xmath100 tev , and take the tevatron energy as @xmath96 tev .",
    "we see from the figure that for @xmath101 gev , the cross section is about 900  fb , dropping to about 65  fb for @xmath102",
    ". moreover , it remains at the level of several fb even for @xmath10 as high as 500 gev .",
    "these cross sections are well in excess of those which enter the cdf and d0 search for gluino pair production . to understand why , we first note that gluino pair production for @xmath57 gev is dominated by valence quark annihilation via @xmath84 fusion at the tevatron .",
    "the @xmath103 fusion subprocess is dominant at much lower gluino masses , where the gluon pdfs have their peak magnitude at small parton fractional momentum @xmath104 .",

    "the @xmath106- and @xmath107-channel interference terms contribute _ negatively _ to the total production cross section , thereby leading to an actual suppression of @xmath108 for @xmath109 . for @xmath110 on the other hand , the @xmath29-channel , @xmath105-channel and interference terms are all highly suppressed , leaving the @xmath85-channel gluon exchange contribution unsuppressed and dominant .",

    "[ fig : bf ] . here , we see that at low @xmath128 gev , the mode @xmath129 occurs at over 60% , and dominates the @xmath130 branching fraction , which occurs at typically 1020%@xcite . as @xmath10 increases , the decay modes @xmath131 grows from the kinematically suppressed value of below 10% at @xmath128 gev , to @xmath132 at @xmath133 gev .",
    "all these dominant decay modes lead to two @xmath4s per gluino in the final state , so that for gluino pair production at the tevatron , we expect collider events containing almost always @xmath94 jets @xmath134 , with @xmath94 @xmath4-jets .",

    "the lep2 chargino mass limit usually implies @xmath175 gev .",
    "2 .   gluino pair production cross sections with @xmath57 gev are enhanced at the tevatron due to the extremely high squark masses expected in yukawa - unified susy .",
    "the huge value of @xmath111 acts to suppress negative interference effects in the @xmath3 subprocess cross section , leading to elevated production rates .",
    "3 .   gluinos of yukawa - unified susy decay through cascade decays to final states almost always containing four @xmath4-jets , and sometimes six or eight @xmath4-jets , depending if @xmath176 occurs . by searching for collider events with @xmath94 jets plus large @xmath88 , along with @xmath6 or 3 @xmath4-jets which are tagged through the micro - vertex detector ,",
    "sm backgrounds can be reduced by large factors , at only a small cost to signal .",
    "this may allow tevatron experiments to search for gluinos with mass in excess of 400 gev .",
    "such gluino masses are far beyond currently published bounds , and would allow exploration of a huge swath of parameter space of yukawa - unified susy models .",
