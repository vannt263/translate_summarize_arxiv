    "the large majority of the point sources detected by the compton gamma - ray observatory in the 1990s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are still lacking an association with a low - energy candidate counterpart , and given their sky distribution , a significant fraction of these unresolved objects are expected to have extragalactic origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unveiling the origin of the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources ( ugss ) is also one of the key scientific objectives of the recent _ fermi _  mission that still lists about 1/3 of the @xmath0-ray sources as unassociated in the second _ fermi_-lat catalog ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a large fraction of ugss is expected to be blazars , the largest known population of @xmath0-ray active galaxies , not yet associated and/or recognized due to the lack of multifrequency observations @xcite .",
    "therefore a better understanding of the nature of the ugss is crucial to estimate accurately the blazar contribution to the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , statistical approaches based on different techniques have been also developed and successfully used ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we recently addressed the problem of searching @xmath0-ray blazar candidates as counterparts of the ugss adopting two new approaches : the first is based on the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) all - sky observations @xcite aiming at recognizing @xmath0-ray blazar candidates using their peculiar ir colors @xcite while the second employs the low - frequency radio observations @xcite .",
    "in particular , this second method was indeed based on the combination of the radio observations westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; * ? ? ? * ) at 325 mhz with those of the nrao very large array sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ? * ) and of the very large array faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) at about 1.4 ghz .",
    "it is worth noting that all the _ fermi _  extragalactic sources associated in the 2fgl catalog have a clear radio counterpart @xcite , this is the basis of the radio-@xmath0-ray connection , that has been found in the case of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , motivated by this observational evidence we propose a different approach to search for the blazar - like counterparts of the ugss .",
    "we combine the radio and the ir information available for the sources lying within the positional uncertainty regions of the _ fermi _  ugss to select @xmath0-ray blazar candidates .    with respect to our previous ir based search for blazar - like counterparts + ( e.g. , * ?",

    "* ) our new analysis relaxes the constraint on the 22@xmath1 m detection of the _ wise_-selected candidates , and does not take into account their [ 12]-[22 ] @xmath1 m color , replacing these features with the presence of a radio counterpart .",
    "the number of @xmath0-ray blazars undetected at 22@xmath1 m is only a small fraction ( @xmath28%of the total number of @xmath0-ray blazars * ? ? ? * ) , but includes several high redshift sources that lying at larger distance than the whole population .    to perform our analysis",

    "our analysis of the ir colors is restricted only to the [ 3.4]-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath1 m color - color plot .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : sample ] is devoted to the definitions of the samples used while in section  [ sec : kde ] we describe the kde technique used to perform our investigation ; we then applied our selection in section  [ sec : ugs ] to identify those radio sources that could be considered blazar - like counterpart of the ugss listed in the 2fgl catalog .",
    "we also verified the presence of optical and x - ray counterparts for the selected @xmath0-ray blazar candidates and we compare our results with different approaches previously developed .",

    "then the ugss sample considered is the one constituted by all the _ fermi _  sources listed in the 2fgl with no assigned counterpart at low energies and without any @xmath0-ray analysis flag listing 299 sources @xcite .",
    "we further divided this sample in two subsamples : the northern ugs ( nu ) sample where only sources with declination above than -40 deg and the southern ugs ( su ) sample selecting those at declination below -30 deg .",
    "this subdivision has been chosen on the basis of the footprints of the radio surveys used for our analysis , since the nu sample is mainly covered by the nvss survey @xcite , while the su one by the sumss catalog @xcite .",
    "the former sample lists 209 ugss while 115 sources belong to the latter one .",
    "finally , we also considered the list of all the radio sources recently found by petrov et al .",

    "this sample is labeled as southern deep atca ( sda ) sample .",
    "the kde technique is a non - parametric procedure to estimate the probability density function of a multivariate distribution without requiring any assumption about the shape of the `` parent '' distribution .",
    "the kde technique also permits to reconstruct the density distribution of a population of points in a general n - dimensional space based on a finite sample .",
    "this analysis depends on only one parameter , the bandwidth of the kernel of the density estimator ( analogous to the window size for one - dimensional running average ) that can be estimated locally ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* for more details ) .",
    "thus in the present analysis we use the kde method to compare the ir colors of the radio selected counterparts with those of the @xmath0-ray blazar population represented by the tb sample in the 2-dimensional [ 3.4]-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath1 m color - color plot . as already described in massaro et al .",

    "for each ugs we searched for all the radio sources that lie within their positional uncertainty regions at 95% level of confidence and we found that there are 822 radio sources potential counterparts of 209 ugss and 134 out of 115 for the nu and the su samples , respectively .",
    "we then crossmatched all these radio sources with the _ wise _",
    "all - sky catalog @xcite using the same radius of 3.3 and we selected only those with an ir counterpart detected at least in the first three _ wise _  filters and not extended ( i.e. , extension flag , @xmath6 1 ) @xcite .",
    "the 3.3 radius chosen to associated sources between the _ wise _  and the radio catalogs is statistically justified on the basis of the analysis performed over the entire roma - bzcat  ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "thus we obtained 374 out of 822 and 78 out of 134 radio sources in the nu and su samples , respectively .",

    "we found 41 and 14 radio sources _ wise _  selected with @xmath70.1 within the nu and the su samples , respectively .",
    "in addition , only 11 out of 416 radio sources listed in the sda sample have an ir counterpart consistent with the _ fermi _  blazar population of the tb sample with @xmath710.0 .",
    "we also list two exceptions to the above criteria : the ugs 2fglj1223.3 + 7954 with its _ wise _  blazar candidate wise j122358.17 + 795327.8 in the nu sample and 2fglj0523.3 - 2530 with wise j052313.07 - 253154.4 as potential counterpart in the sda sample , having the @xmath5 values equal to 9.6 and 9.5 , respectively , marginally below our threshold .",
    "the total number of @xmath0-ray blazar candidates is 66 all listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] and table  [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that we do not have any multiple @xmath0-ray blazar candidate within the positional uncertainty regions of the ugss analyzed .    in figure",

    "more detailed investigations based on ground - based , optical and near ir , spectroscopic follow up observations will be planned for the selected @xmath0-ray blazar candidates to confirm their nature and to obtain their redshifts .     name & mag & mag & mag & mag & mag & arcsec + j003119.70 + 072453.6 & 19.03 & 18.17 & 19.84 & 18.63 & 18.67 & 0.14 + j003908.14 + 433014.6 & 19.9 & 19.61 & 21.42 & 20.77 & & 0.14 + j010345.73 + 132345.4 & 17.98 & 17.73 & 18.69 & 17.38 & 17.24 & 0.07 + j011619.59 - 615343.5 & & 17.72 & 18.22 & 17.78 & 17.91 & 0.27 + j013306.35 - 441421.3 & & 18.38 & 19.7 & 18.12 & 18.76 & 0.26 + j014347.39 - 584551.3 & & 16.7 & 18.48 & 16.64 & 17.04 & 0.04 + j015248.80 + 855703.6 & 20.57 & 18.84 & 19.63 & 18.71 & 17.82 & 0.38 + j020020.94 - 410935.6 & & 19.84 & 21.1 & 18.79 & 18.75 & 0.6 + j022744.35 + 224834.3 & & & 20.82 & 20.22 & 19.28 & 0.35 + j031240.54 + 201142.8 & & 19.34 & 21.22 & 19.42 & 19.07 & 2.63 + j031614.31 - 643731.4 & & 16.59 & 18.19 & 16.57 & 16.82 & 0.22 + j033153.90 + 630814.1 & & & 20.66 & 19.92 & 18.35 & 0.35 + j034022.89 - 242407.2 & & 19.56 & 20.07 & & & 0.21 + j035309.54 + 565430.8 & 20.09 & 19.24 & 20.43 & 18.76 & 18.53 & 0.55 + j040946.57 - 040003.4 & 19.45 & 19.18 & 17.53 & 16.98 & 16.86 & 0.07 + j041605.81 - 435514.6 & & 18.49 & 18.7 & 18.17 & 18.0 & 0.18 + j042025.09 - 374445.0 & & 20.44 & 20.73 & 19.71 & 18.17 & 0.38 + j052313.07 - 253154.4 & & 19.2 & 20.83 & 20.07 & 18.95 & 0.17 + j055618.74 - 435146.1 & & 19.23 & 18.88 & 19.08 & 18.08 & 0.31 + j060102.86 + 383829.2 & & 19.11 & & 19.84 & 18.48 & 0.04 + j064435.72 + 603851.2 & 20.01 & 19.58 & 20.7 & 18.75 & 18.37 & 0.3 + j065845.02 + 063711.5 & 20.25 & & & 19.12 & 18.3 & 0.39 + j072354.83 + 285929.9 & 19.78 & 19.05 & 19.97 & 18.72 & & 0.19 + j074627.03 - 022549.3 & 19.03 & & 18.59 & 18.43 & 16.53 & 0.31 + j092849.83 - 352948.9 & & 18.56 & 19.64 & 18.07 & 18.23 & 0.23 + j093754.72 - 143350.3 & 18.82 & 17.92 & 18.64 & 17.73 & 17.56 & 0.1 + j101544.44 + 555100.7 & 19.69 & 19.42 & 20.61 & 19.35 & & 0.37 + j103015.35 - 840308.7 & & 19.36 & 19.26 & 18.84 & 18.03 & 0.15 + j111511.74 - 070239.9 & & 19.86 & 20.68 & 19.05 & 18.66 & 0.14 + j112325.38 - 252857.0 & 16.9 & 15.76 & 15.87 & 15.56 & 15.51 & 0.19 + j112903.25 + 375657.4 & 19.9 & 19.23 & 19.35 & 19.48 & 18.58 & 0.65 + j122358.17 + 795327.8 & & 17.6 & 20.18 & 18.46 & 17.63 & 1.04 + j125422.47 - 220413.6 & & 19.88 & 18.67 & 19.11 & 18.22 & 0.41 + j125949.80 - 374858.1 & & 17.44 & 18.07 & 16.78 & 17.35 & 0.17 + j131552.98 - 073301.9 & 19.78 & 18.68 & 18.75 & 17.75 & 17.56 & 0.16 + j132840.61 - 472749.2 & & 17.75 & 18.23 & 16.8 & & 0.98 + j133916.44 - 234829.4 & 20.3 & 19.3 & 20.43 & 19.79 & 18.5 & 0.31 + j134042.02 - 041006.8 & 18.21 & 17.21 & 17.59 & 16.46 & 17.08 & 0.19 + j134543.05 - 335643.3 & & 17.98 & 19.58 & 18.65 & 18.12 & 0.38 + j134706.89 - 295842.3 & 17.85 & 17.09 & 18.8 & 17.14 & 17.09 & 0.41 + j151303.66 - 253925.9 & 19.92 & 18.96 & 19.77 & 20.35 & & 0.5 + j151649.26 + 365022.9 & 20.9 & & 21.49 & 20.07 & 19.16 & 1.58 + j154824.39 + 145702.8 & 20.51 & 18.29 & 19.86 & 17.74 & 17.45 & 0.41 + j164619.95 + 435631.0 & 20.43 & 19.73 & 20.42 & 19.67 & & 0.34 + j170409.59 + 123421.7 & 19.86 & 18.04 & 18.62 & 17.63 & 17.46 & 0.47 + j170433.84 - 052840.6 & 19.62 & 18.97 & 18.42 & 17.28 & 17.98 & 0.45 + j200506.02 + 700439.3 & 20.73 & 19.25 & 19.24 & 18.65 & & 0.45 + j202155.45 + 062913.7 & 17.27 & 16.13 & 17.01 & 16.67 & 16.03 & 0.43 + j203451.08 - 420038.2 & & 18.97 & 19.34 & 18.87 & 18.27 & 0.44 + j204201.92 - 731913.5 & & 17.46 & 17.9 & 18.36 & 18.04 & 0.29 + j211522.00 + 121802.8 & 18.15 & 18.15 & 17.68 & 17.31 & 17.58 & 0.16 + j213253.05 + 261143.8 & 20.04 & 19.29 & 19.14 & 19.62 & 18.44 & 0.07 + j213430.18 - 213032.6 & 19.77 & 18.65 & 18.96 & 16.8 & 17.7 & 0.09 + j213349.21 + 664704.3 & & & & 19.37 & 18.8 & 0.45 + j221330.33 - 475425.0 & & 18.12 & 18.6 & 18.34 & 18.33 & 0.05 + j222830.19 - 163642.8 & 18.57 & 19.34 & 19.95 & 19.04 & 17.91 & 0.29 + j224604.98 + 154435.3 & 19.14 & 18.27 & 19.57 & 18.53 & 17.65 & 0.13 + j225128.69 - 492910.6 & & 18.8 & 19.21 & 18.45 & 18.03 & 0.42 + j234302.29 - 475749.9 & & 19.84 & 18.92 & 21.3 & 18.32 & 0.29 + j235836.83 - 180717.3 & 19.14 & 18.45 & 18.28 & 17.22 & 17.53 & 0.3",
