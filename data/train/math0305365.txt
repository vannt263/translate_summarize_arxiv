    "this numbering has bandwidth @xmath23 and induces exactly @xmath32 edges of length @xmath23 ( all horizontal edges incident to the main diagonal vertices ) .",
    "note that the down diagonal lexicographical vertex numbering of @xmath21 that we just displayed indicates that we sometimes think of @xmath18 as a rectangular board of dimension @xmath0 ( meaning @xmath23 rows and @xmath33 columns ) in which the squares represent the vertices and any pair of squares that have common side are considered to be neighbors .    by the result of chvtalov , we know that in order to make a linear arrangement of the square grid @xmath21 we must be ready to use pieces of wire of length at least @xmath23 . moreover , by the result of fishburn and wright , in order to make an arrangement that does not use any pieces longer than @xmath23 , we must be ready to use at least @xmath32 pieces of length @xmath23 .",
    "but what if we do not have such long pieces ? in such a case the most practical thing one can do is to try to assemble as large part of the graph as possible , which amounts to deletion of some of the edges .",

    "this implies that if a graph on @xmath23 vertices has more than @xmath61 edges , then its bandwidth is at least @xmath62 , for @xmath57 .",
    "before we move on , we observe that the bandwidth of a graph can be reduced by more than 1 by deletion of a single edge .",
    "this is why we require the newly obtained graph to have bandwidth no greater than @xmath54 rather than exactly @xmath54 in the definition of the @xmath2-th bandwidth reduction number .",
    "consider the graph @xmath7 that consists of two copies of the wheel @xmath47 with an additional edge between the wheel centers ( two wheels with an axis between them ) .",
    "since an arbitrary graph on @xmath16 vertices with diameter @xmath63 and bandwidth @xmath41 satisfies @xmath64 the bandwidth of the graph @xmath7 is at least 5 ( @xmath16=14 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "however the deletion of the edge between the centers of the two wheels leads to a graph of bandwidth 3 .",
    "thus @xmath66 for this graph .",
    "we give now an upper bound on the @xmath2-th bandwidth reduction number in rectangular grids , for small @xmath2 .",
    "[ reduction ] let @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath2-th bandwidth reduction number of the rectangular grid @xmath18 satisfies @xmath68    we construct an example of a numbering @xmath13 of @xmath18 in which only @xmath3 edges are longer than @xmath62 .",
    "the example is a modification of the down diagonal lexicographical linear arrangement .",
    "think of @xmath18 as of rectangular board of dimension @xmath69 .",
    "first modify the board by cutting out the lower right part of the board of dimension @xmath70 and flipping it over as indicated in figure  [ fig : reduction ] .",
    "with @xmath3 edges longer than @xmath62 ]    enumerate all the squares in the modified board in the down diagonal lexicographical fashion .",
    "consider a `` typical '' vertex @xmath72 that lives on a diagonal of length @xmath73 .",
    "the vertical edges incident to @xmath72 have length @xmath73 and the horizontal ones have length @xmath74 .",
    "a `` typical '' vertex @xmath75 that lives on a diagonal of length @xmath62 is incident to horizontal edges of length @xmath62 and vertical edges of length @xmath76 .",
    "a `` typical '' vertex @xmath77 that lives on a diagonal of length @xmath2 is incident to vertical edges of length @xmath2 and horizontal edges of length @xmath78 , where the inequality comes from the assumption that @xmath79 . in all `` atypical '' cases , near the bottom left or the upper right corner(s ) of the modified board ,",
    "the diagonals are even shorter , which implies that the incident edges are also shorter .",
    "thus the bandwidth of the given numbering of the modified board is @xmath62 .",
    "after we flip back the modified part of the board to its original position the newly created @xmath2 horizontal edges ( between the non - shaded and the shaded part of the board ) will have length longer than @xmath62 and all but one of the newly created @xmath80 vertical edges will have length longer than @xmath62 . indeed",
    "the induced length of the rightmost vertical edge between the shaded and the non - shaded part is exactly @xmath62 , since its endpoints ( denoted by @xmath81 and @xmath11 in figure  [ fig : reduction ] ) were already neighbors in the modified board .",
    "we provide one example to illustrate the preceding result .",
    "assume that we want to reduce the bandwidth of @xmath82 to 6 .",
    "thus @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the numbering of the modified board is given by @xmath85    another way to state theorem  [ reduction ] is to say that the incidence matrix of @xmath18 can be written in such a way that all non - zero entries , except for @xmath3 symmetric pairs , are within distance @xmath62 from the main diagonal .",
    "for example , this means that the incidence matrix of the square grid @xmath21 can be written in such a way that all non - zero entries , except for 2 symmetric pairs , are within distance @xmath40 from the main diagonal .",
    "this contrasts nicely with theorem  [ thm:2(n-1 ) ] , which implies that if all non - zero entries of the incidence matrix of @xmath21 are within distance @xmath23 from the main diagonal then there are at least @xmath32 symmetric pairs of non - zero entries at distance @xmath23 from the main diagonal .",
    "we show now that the bandwidth of square grids can not be reduced if only 1 edge is deleted .",
    "the exceptional cases are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , @xmath88 has bandwidth 0 which can not be reduced , while @xmath89 is the cycle @xmath90 and its bandwidth reduction number is 1 .",

    "the bandwidth reduction number of @xmath21 is 2 , i.e. , the minimal number of edges that needs to be deleted from @xmath21 in order to obtain a graph of bandwidth @xmath40 is 2 .",
    "moreover , the edges that need to be deleted may , but do not have to , share a common endpoint .    for an arbitrary numbering @xmath13 of @xmath21 , call an edge _",
    "long _ if its induced length is at least @xmath23 and call it _ short _ otherwise .",
    "an example of a numbering of @xmath21 , for @xmath91 , with only two long edges is already provided in the proof of theorem  [ reduction ] .",
    "we note that the two long edges in that example share a common vertex , namely the vertex in row @xmath23 column @xmath40 .",
    "the lengths of the long edges are @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    rather than providing a general example of a numbering with only two long edges that are not adjacent",
    ", we provide an example for the case @xmath94 , from which one can easily extract the general pattern .",
    "the two long edges , which are the two leftmost vertical edges between the top two rows , have lengths @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97    it remains to show that every numbering of @xmath21 , @xmath91 , has at least two long edges .",
    "let @xmath13 be an arbitrary labelling of @xmath21 .",
    "choose the smallest @xmath2 such that all rows or all columns of @xmath21 have a label in @xmath8 $ ] .",

    "no row is completely numbered by @xmath98 .",
    "otherwise each column would have a label from @xmath99 $ ] which contradicts the minimality in the choice of @xmath2 .",
    "call an edge between vertex numbered by an element in @xmath8 $ ] and an element not in @xmath8 $ ] a _ boundary edge_. if there are at least @xmath100 boundary edges then at least two of them would have to be long .",
    "a direct corollary of claim  2 is that each row has at least one horizontal boundary edge .",
    "this already means that there must be at least one long edge ( apropos , this proves theorem  [ thm : chvatalova ] in the case of square grids ) .",
    "thus , we assume in the sequel that there are exactly @xmath23 horizontal boundary edges and only one of them is long .",
    "moreover , we assume that this is the only long edge in @xmath13 and we seek a contradiction .",
    "* claim 3 . * the endpoints of the @xmath40 short horizontal boundary edges are numbered by the pairs @xmath101 while the endpoints of the long edge come from a pair @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is a `` small '' number less than or equal to @xmath104 and @xmath105 is a `` large '' number greater or equal to @xmath106 .    indeed ,",
    "any other numbering of the endpoints of the boundary edges would result in at least two long horizontal edges .",
    "* claim 4 . * for every row @xmath58 in @xmath21 , the vertices labelled by the partial numbering @xmath98 form a horizontal path @xmath107 that ends at the leftmost or the rightmost column .",
    "this follows from the fact that every row has exactly one horizontal boundary edge .",
    "thus each row contains a unique maximal path that consists of vertices numbered by @xmath98 .",
    "these @xmath23 paths will be called @xmath98-paths .",
    "* claim 5 . * the @xmath98-path in any row next to @xmath2 consist of a single vertex in the column of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , if the neighboring row has a vertex labelled by @xmath98 that is not in the same column as @xmath2 , this vertex would be involved in a vertical edge that would have to be long ( all vertices in the row of @xmath2 are labelled by numbers greater or equal to @xmath108 ) .    without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that the vertex @xmath2 ( together with its vertical neighbors from @xmath8 $ ] ) is in the leftmost column in @xmath21 .",
    "* claim 6 . *",
    "if the @xmath98-path @xmath109 is no longer than @xmath110 , then the @xmath98-path @xmath111 in any neighboring row occupies the same columns as @xmath109 or differs in exactly one column .",
    "again , in any other case there would be a long vertical edge involving a number from @xmath8 $ ] and a number outside of @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "note that we required that the length of @xmath109 be no longer than @xmath110 , since if the length is @xmath40 the neighboring @xmath98-path @xmath111 may also have length @xmath40 and start at the opposite end without creating additional long vertical edge(s ) .",
    "however , we will see that this does not happen .",
    "* claim 7 . * no horizontal @xmath98-path is longer than @xmath110 and they all start at the left end .",
    "the length of the @xmath98-path @xmath2 is 1 and so is the length of the neighboring @xmath98-path(s ) .",
    "going further away , the length of the @xmath98-paths can only go up by 1 from one row to another , so the only way we can have a @xmath98-path of length @xmath40 is if @xmath2 is in the bottom or in the top row , the next @xmath98-path has length 1 and the length of the remaining @xmath98-paths grows by 1 as we move away from the row of @xmath2 .",
    "without loss of generality assume that @xmath2 is in the bottom left corner .",
    "consider now the @xmath98-path @xmath112 , corresponding to the row with a long horizontal edge , together with the horizontal path @xmath111 in the row below .",
    "@xmath113 where the stars represent arbitrary numbers in @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "clearly , if @xmath114 is not in @xmath8 $ ] we obtain a long vertical edge with endpoints @xmath114 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus @xmath114 is in @xmath8 $ ] and the lengths of @xmath112 and @xmath111 are equal .",
    "since the lengths of the @xmath98-paths start at 1 and repeat at the row of @xmath2 and at the row of @xmath103 , the longest @xmath98-path can only reach the length @xmath110 .",
    "* claim 8 . *",
    "the @xmath98-path @xmath112 corresponding to the row with the long horizontal edge @xmath115 has the same length as the @xmath98-paths in the rows next to it .",
    "we already proved that the @xmath98-path below @xmath112 can not be shorter than @xmath112 .",
    "it can not be longer as well , since the configuration @xmath116 with @xmath114 in @xmath8 $ ] , indicates that @xmath105 and @xmath114 are the endpoints of a long vertical edge . by symmetry",
    ", the @xmath98-path above @xmath112 also has length equal to the length of @xmath112 .",
    "this finishes the proof of claim 8 .",
    "we now consider the partial numbering @xmath117 that corresponds to the set of numbers @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "as observed before , the numbers @xmath119 are placed in different rows , one in each row except for the row of the long horizontal edge @xmath120 .",
    "thus @xmath40 horizontal boundary edges are now formed between the vertices numbered by @xmath118 $ ] and those not numbered by @xmath118 $ ] . in addition , there exist at least one vertical boundary edge with endpoints in an element of @xmath118 $ ] and @xmath105 .",
    "these @xmath23 boundary edges of the partial numbering @xmath117 must contain a long edge , a contradiction .",
    "we conjecture that in order to reduce the bandwidth of @xmath18 by @xmath2 , for @xmath121 , we need to delete at least @xmath3 edges , i.e. , we conjecture that the upper bound provided by theorem  [ reduction ] is the actual value of the bandwidth reduction number for all sufficiently small values of @xmath2 .",
    "theorem  [ thm:2 ] shows that this conjecture is true when @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm:2 ] indicates an easy way to see that at least @xmath2 edges need to be deleted in order to reduce the bandwidth of @xmath18 by @xmath2 .",
    "namely , the first time some partial numbering has a representative in each row ( or each column ) there would be at least @xmath23 horizontal ( or vertical ) boundary edges at least @xmath2 of which must have length at least @xmath124 .",
    "for a numbering @xmath13 of a graph @xmath4 one can define the _ vertex - isoperimetric _ number of @xmath13 to be the maximal number of vertices in @xmath7 numbered by @xmath8 $ ] that have neighbors that are not numbered by @xmath8 $ ] , where the maximum is taken over all @xmath125 .",
    "the smallest possible vertex - isoperimetric number , taken over all numberings of @xmath7 , is the _ vertex - isoperimetric number _ of the graph @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath126 is the bandwidth of @xmath7 and @xmath127 is its vertex - isoperimetric number then @xmath128 it is well known that the vertex - isoperimetric number of the square grid @xmath21 is @xmath23 .",
    "the down diagonal lexicographical linear arrangement provides an example of a numbering with vertex - isoperimetric number @xmath23 and the proof of theorem  [ thm:2 ] essentially contains a proof that this number can not be less than @xmath23 .",
    "thus in order to reduce the bandwidth of @xmath21 we need to delete enough edges so that at least the vertex - isoperimetric number is reduced .",
    "however , one can reduce the vertex - isoperimetric number of @xmath21 by deleting only one edge . for example , consider the case of @xmath129 and the numbering given by @xmath130 if the edge with endpoints labelled by 7 and 13 is deleted , the newly obtained graph has vertex - isoperimetric number 3 .",
    "this indicates that , in general , the problem of bandwidth reduction is more difficult than the problem of vertex - isoperimetric number reduction . it also explains why , in the course of the proof of theorem  [ thm:2 ] , it was relatively easy to show that at least one edge needed to be deleted , but one had to work harder for the second edge .    finally , we note that the @xmath2-th bandwidth reduction number of the square grid @xmath21 is bounded linearly by @xmath131 , for @xmath121 , i.e , one has to delete relatively small number of edges to reduce the bandwidth substantially .",
    "however , it is clear that for @xmath132 the bandwidth reduction gets more difficult .",
    "a linear bound on the bandwidth reduction number simply can not be found for all @xmath2 .",
