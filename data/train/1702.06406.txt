    "the recent advances in study of strongly correlated systems has led to wider search for exotic non - fermi - liquid states in condensed matter systems . in particular , the quest for edge states protected against disorder has started .",
    "these states are protected by a symmetry that forbids perturbations potentially dangerous for the phase stability .",
    "the perturbations presenting a threat to stability may also be forbidden by a conservation law .",
    "another option is the renormalisation of dangerous perturbations such that they become suppressed at low temperatures and vanish in zero - temperature regime leading to a protected zero - temperature state .",
    "one of the promising models providing rich non - fermi - liquid physics is an anisotropic system consisting of array of coupled one - dimensional wires .",
    "this model was used to for construction of integer @xcite and fractional quantum hall states @xcite .",
    "sliding phases in classical @xmath0 models @xcite , smectic metals @xcite and many other exotic states are all described by the sliding luttinger liquid ( sll ) model @xcite .",
    "infinite arrays of wires and few - channel liquids have been investigated for decades .",
    "their stability against disorder is another wide area of research .",
    "a single impurity embedded into a luttinger liquid @xcite and a continuous disorder in luttinger liquid @xcite are known to be essential for a single channel problem .",
    "the renormalisation group ( rg ) analysis shows that transport of repulsive electrons is completely blocked by a single impurity at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the role of disorder ( local impurity ) embedded into a luttinger liquid ( ll ) coupled to quasi - one - dimensional quadratic bath was explored in @xcite .",
    "multi - channel strongly correlated systems with disorder have not been studied yet .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study local impurity coupled to a multi - channel luttinger liquid .",
    "we will develop generic approach allowing treatment of various realisations of multi - channel luttinger liquids where channels are either labeled by quantum numbers or spatially arranged to form an array of wires .",
    "in particular , we investigate effect of a single impurity onto array of weakly coupled luttinger liquids ( sliding luttinger liquid ) .",
    "the results obtained also describe an array of wires with low density of multiple impurities at moderate temperatures when thermal length is smaller than the mean distance between impurities and , therefore , each impurity renormalises individually .",
    "we also assume that hybridisation , @xmath1 , between channels / wires is small enough to ensure that the temperature , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the bandwidth and the exponent @xmath4 is defined through the scaling dimension , @xmath5 , of the most dangerous hybridization term ) is low enough and can not be reached . under these assumptions",
    "we may safely use model of interacting but not hybridised wires ( channels ) with disorder modelled by individual impurities . and under these assumption we will demonstrate that in some region of parameters ( intra- and inter - wire interaction strengths ) we should observe edge states in 2d array of correlated wires without both magnetic field ( preserved time - reversal symmetry ) and spin - orbit scattering .",
    "the inter - wire interaction may enhance impurity scattering in the bulk wires ( making them insulating ) and suppress impurity scattering in the edge wires .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the one observed in quantum hall systems or topological insulators .",
    "it is important to stress here , that the edge states we describe in this paper require neither time - reversal symmetry breaking nor spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it is known that rg flow for a single channel problem depends on single parameter ( so - called luttinger parameter ) k while excitations velocity does not play any role in the renormalisation @xcite .",
    "our general construction generalises this result : @xmath6-channel ll is described by @xmath6 velocities and a real symmetric @xmath7 matrix which we call luttinger @xmath8-matrix responsible for impurity renormalisation .",
    "this matrix must be found from the algebraic matrix equation @xmath9 where the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe density - density and current - current short - range ( intra- and inter - channel ) interactions between electrons .",
    "it is this luttinger @xmath8-matrix that defines scaling dimensions of all possible scattering terms in all possible channel configurations ( some are ideal , i.e conducting , and others insulating ) .",
    "any process of @xmath12 backscattered ( tunneled ) particles in conducting ( insulating ) @xmath13-th channel is described by an operator with scaling dimension given by @xmath14={\\bf n}^{\\rm t}\\,{\\hat\\delta}\\,{\\bf n}\\,,\\quad { \\hat\\delta}^{-1}={\\hat{\\cal p}}_{\\rm",

    "just the fact that we may find all scaling dimensions from a single @xmath8-matrix allows reconstruction of a generic phase diagram of a sll .",
    "we will demonstrate how it works on two examples : mixture of two distinguishable @xmath17 species and infinite array of wires ( sll ) .",
    "our main result will be the application of this generic approach to a finite 2d array ( strip ) which will prove the existence the edge state robust against disorder ( unlike bulk wires ) for the weak intra - channel attraction between fermions .",
    "we believe that our general approach , when applied to sll , will enable reconstruction of generic phase diagram , provide simple scheme of calculating scaling dimensions of perturbations needed to analyse phase stability for the entire range of parameters , and allow identification of mixed states ( described by rg unstable fixed points ) corresponding to first - order phase transitions in such systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recap multi - channel liquid description ( the green function and the luttinger matrix are derived in the [ asll ] and [ vpm ] ) , introduce description of arbitrary configuration consisting of a set of conducting and insulating channels , and construct lagrangian capturing generic scattering by a local perturbation . sec .",
    "iii describes applications analysed earlier elsewhere simply to demonstrate how the devised approach works in the known situations ( explicit calculations can be found the [ apps ] ) .",
    "iv is devoted the problem of finite sll in the nearest neighbours interaction approximation . and finally , in sec .",
    "v we analyse the problem of the existence of the edge states that supports low - temperature transport when bulk is insulating . in [ svp ] and",

    "different channels ( further labeled by an integer @xmath18 ) might correspond to different quantum numbers ( spin or quasi - spin nomenclature ) or , if a spatial dimension added to the problem ( geometry , i.e. distance between channels ) , describe an anisotropic system composed of parallel chains with luttinger liquids in each chain .",

    "this means that a perturbation theory would be divergent and allegedly translation invariant configuration is a bad initial approximation . in terms of transport , this fact suggests that some ( all or few ) of the channels ( wires ) become insulating and not ideally conducting as it is assumed in a translation invariant configuration . to test stability of such an inhomogeneous configuration where some channels are conducting",
    "while others are insulating we have to introduce two subspaces of conducting , @xmath33 , and insulating , @xmath34 , channels .",
    "since we have no _  priori _ knowledge which configuration will be stable ( and , therefore , may be called a phase ) against all meaningful perturbations , we must devise generic approach allowing treatment of all possible configurations .",
