    "the recent surge of interest in hamiltonians which , although non - hermitian , nevertheless have a completely real spectrum began with the pioneering paper of bender and boettcher  @xcite , which gave strong numerical and analytical evidence that the spectrum of the class of hamiltonians [ m=1 ] h = p^2 -(ix)^n was completely real and positive for @xmath1 , and attributed this reality to the ( unbroken ) @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian . since",
    "then a large number of @xmath0 -symmetric models have been explored ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and it was found that the phenomenon is rather general .",
    "the natural metric arising in such theories is not positive definite , which precludes a straightforward physical interpretation in terms of probability amplitudes .",
    "however , it turns out to be possible to construct  @xcite a grading operator @xmath2 , which gives a positive - definite metric @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to standard quantum mechanics , where the metric is the same for any hermitian theory , here the metric is determined in each case by the hamiltonian itself . in the schrdinger wave - function formulation of quantum mechanics , this metric appears explicitly in the calculation of green functions ; however , in the path - integral of functional formulation its role is much more subtle  @xcite .    the class of hamiltonians ( [ m=1 ] ) can be thought of as a continuation in the exponent of the potential , starting with the harmonic oscillator , @xmath4 . a more general class of hamiltonians  @xcite",
    "is obtained by continuation off the @xmath5 oscillator : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ; @xmath8 .",
    "they include the harmonic oscillator @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , and non - hermitian hamiltonians such as @xmath12 ( @xmath10 , @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath10 , @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the eigenvalue equation corresponding to ( [ m<>1 ] ) is -_n(x)+x^2m(ix)^_n(x)=e_n(x ) [ sequation ] ( throughout the text , @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 is required to vanish as @xmath20 . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "when the total exponent @xmath21 is greater than 4 the boundary condition can no longer be satisfied with @xmath22 real , and one is obliged to analytically continue the eigenvalue equation ( [ sequation ] ) into the complex plane .",
    "specifically it should be continued into the lower half @xmath22 plane within a stokes wedge symmetrically placed with respect to the imaginary axis   and @xmath16 are in fact non - hermitian and @xmath0-symmetric . ] .",
    "when this is done , the energy spectrum turns out to be real , discrete and positive  @xcite . a rigorous proof of this property was eventually constructed by dorey et al .",
    "@xcite . for reviews of the whole field of non - hermitian hamiltonians",
    "see @xcite .    in principle",
    "it is possible  @xcite to relate @xmath23 by a similarity transformation to an equivalent hermitian hamiltonian @xmath24 with the same energy spectrum .",
    "however , such a programme is difficult to implement , and an exact form for @xmath24 is available only in very few cases .",
    "it should be stressed that , unlike ( [ sequation ] ) , the eigenvalue equation corresponding to @xmath24 can always be solved on the real axis .",
    "possible physical applications of these unusual hamiltonians are beginning to emerge .",
    "we mention here the  quantum brachistochrone \" , in which the standard lower bound for the transition time between two states can be circumvented  @xcite by a judicious interplay of hermitian and non - hermitian systems .",
    "how this could be achieved in practice has been recently discussed in @xcite . in analogue optical situations , where the refractive index plays the role of the potential , pt - symmetric systems have been shown to have unusual and interesting properties  @xcite .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , little attention has been paid so far to the thermodynamics of such systems . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the thermodynamics of the hamiltonians of ( [ m<>1 ] ) , which we hope will act as a template for the investigation of other non - hermitian systems . as far as the quantum partition thermodynamics is concerned we need only calculate the energy levels , on which the partition function depends .",
    "the high - temperature limit then probes the classical mechanics of these systems , and we use this to investigate how the classical partition function should be defined , which is not obvious _ a priori_.    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ spectrum ] we show that the energies @xmath25 of ( [ sequation ] ) can be estimated to a high degree of accuracy , even for small values of @xmath26 , using the wkb approximation including the subleading contribution . in sec .",
    "[ qmechanics ] we use the energy levels so determined to evaluate numerically the canonical partition function , which then yields plots illustrating the thermal behavior of the entropy and the specific heat , at low , intermediate and high temperatures .",
    "the plots also show how the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 affect these quantities . in the high - temperature limit , still using the wkb formula for @xmath25 , we obtain a closed formula for the semiclassical partition function by integration over @xmath26 .",

    "must differ from the usual real phase - space integral , which does not converge .",
    "the special case @xmath30 ( the wrong - sign quartic oscillator ) is ideal for testing these ideas , because in this case one has an explicit form for the equivalent isospectral hermitian hamiltonian @xmath24 .",
    "thus one can start by calculating the semiclassical partition function using the real phase space associated with @xmath24 , and then transform the variables to find the correct integral expression for @xmath29 in terms of the variables appearing in @xmath23 .",
    "[ disc ] includes a summary and further discussion .",
    "an extremely accurate approximation for the spectrum of @xmath23 in ( [ m<>1 ] ) can be obtained using the wkb method including the subleading contribution . in @xcite",
    "the spectra were so calculated for @xmath10 .",

    "the leading wkb contribution is obtained by imposing the condition ( n+1/2)=_x_-^x_+dx [ wkb1 ] over a path for which the integration is real .",
    "choosing the path as the ray going from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , followed by that from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , ( [ wkb1 ] ) can be recast as ( n+1/2)=2(m / n)e^1/2 + 1/n_0 ^ 1ds , [ wkb2 ] which yields the first factor in ( [ wkbspectrum ] ) below .    to calculate the subleading wkb contribution , instead of ( [ wkb1 ] )",
    ", one uses  @xcite [ wkb3 ] ( n+1/2)=(1/2i)_c dx q^1/2 + ( 1/2i)_c dxq/48q^3/2 , where @xmath39 and the contour @xmath2 encircles counterclockwise the rays used to calculate the integration in ( [ wkb1 ] ) .",
    "it follows then that _ c dx&= & n(n-1)(m / n ) + & & e^-1/2 - 1/n_0 ^ 1ds , which when added to ( [ wkb2 ] ) yields ( for large @xmath26 ) [ wkbspectrum ] e_n&= & ( ) ^2n/(n+2 ) + & & ( 1 + ) , after identities involving products of gamma functions are used .",
    "the energy spectrum corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath40 , which we consider for purposes of comparison , is obtained  @xcite by omitting the factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 in ( [ wkbspectrum ] ) [ corresponding to @xmath43 , and the results in @xcite are reproduced by setting @xmath10 in ( [ wkbspectrum ] ) .",

    "the characteristic temperature @xmath66 in ( [ ctemperature ] ) gives the magnitude of the energy gap separating the first excited state and the ground state . as ( [ ctemperature ] ) clearly shows , for a given @xmath27",
    ", @xmath66 is an unbounded increasing function of @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath66 separates the classical thermal behavior [ ( [ entropy ] ) and ( [ sheat ] ) ] from the quantum thermal behavior ( corresponding in the plots to the drop toward zero as @xmath74 ) , one sees that the larger @xmath56 the higher the temperature up to which the quantum behavior still prevails .",
    "these features are clear in the graphics .",
    "it should be noted that z_cl(t)=q_cl(n , t ) ( m / n ) , [ zq ] where q_cl(n , t)= is the semiclassical partition function corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath40 @xcite . as @xmath29 and @xmath75 are proportional to each other , they lead to the same thermodynamics as @xmath76 ( see plots ) , and in particular the specific heat is the same in both cases .",
    "nevertheless there is an important difference , namely , the characteristic temperature associated with @xmath75 is bounded [ it is given by @xmath66 in ( [ ctemperature ] ) omitting @xmath41 ] , and consequently their corresponding thermodynamic functions may differ significantly at intermediate and small temperatures .",
    "for example , if @xmath78 , the corresponding specific heat would have the usual quantum behavior expressed by an exponential decay as @xmath74 , @xmath79 whereas the same @xmath55 might be much greater than the characteristic temperature associated with @xmath75 , for which the classical behavior in ( [ sheat ] ) would be observed .",
    "[ strictly speaking , @xmath66 in ( [ qsheat ] ) should be replaced by the energy gap between the first excited state and the ground state , but this inaccuracy does not spoil the argument . ]",

    "it is not immediately clear what is the correct formulation . for sufficiently small @xmath28",
    "the integral of ( [ zcla ] ) is still convergent , and indeed reproduces correctly the high - temperature limit of ( [ zq ] ) .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath28 , for example @xmath81 in the case @xmath10 , the integral along the real @xmath22-axis diverges , and in order to obtain a convergent result the contour of integration must be continued into the lower half of the complex @xmath22-plane .",
    "the situation is similar , but not identical , to the stokes wedges encountered in the quantum problem  @xcite .",
    "thus , let us set @xmath82 .",
    "the condition for convergence for large @xmath83 is that @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , leading to > 0  .",
    "this leads to wedges in the complex @xmath22-plane where the integral is convergent and other , forbidden , wedges where it is not .",
    "the forbidden wedges rotate downwards and become narrower as @xmath56 increases , in a similar manner to stokes wedges .    in the case",
    "@xmath10 , i.e. continuing away from the harmonic oscillator , the right - hand forbidden wedge is centered on @xmath86 and has opening angle @xmath87 . there is a mirror image in the left - half plane .",
    "so for @xmath88 the lower edge of the forbidden wedges lies precisely on the real axis , confirming that @xmath89 is a limiting case . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the forbidden wedges include the real axis , which is no longer viable as an integration contour .",
    "when @xmath91 the upper edge of the wedges lies on the real axis , and thereafter the wedges lie entirely in the lower half plane .",

    "there is in fact another forbidden wedge centered on the negative imaginary axis , which is avoided by the contour shown .",
    "moreover , these integrals are not only convergent , but they correctly reproduce the semiclassical result of ( [ zq ] ) . thus , for example , in the case @xmath92 , if we integrate along the real axis we obtain @xmath94 , corresponding to the hermitian case @xmath95 , @xmath11 , but if we integrate along the rays @xmath96 , the centres of the next allowed left and right wedges , we obtain precisely the extra factor @xmath97 required to give @xmath29 for @xmath10 .    .",
    "the hyperbolic contour is a possible contour for the non - hermitian @xmath98 ( @xmath10 , @xmath99 ) , whereas integration along the real axis corresponds to @xmath93 ( @xmath95 , @xmath11 ) . ]    in principle , an alternative way of determining what is the correct expression for the classical partition function is to start with the definition in terms of the equivalent hermitian hamiltonian and make the appropriate changes of variables .    as mentioned in the introduction , in quantum mechanics a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath23 with a completely real spectrum",
    "is related to an isospectral hermitian hamiltonian @xmath24 by the similarity transformation  @xcite : [ sim ] h=^-1 h e^q h e^-q , where the metric @xmath100 is written  @xcite in terms of the hermitian operator @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "the operator @xmath103 is therefore hermitian and positive definite .",
    "thus we can certainly write @xmath29 as @xmath104 from ( [ sim ] ) we have the condition of quasi - hermiticity on @xmath23 : [ qh ] h^=e^-q h e^qh ^-1 .",
    "similarly any observable @xmath105 , with real expectation values , must also be quasi - hermitian , i.e. [ qa ] a^=e^-q a e^qa ^-1 .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath105 is related to a standard hermitian counterpart @xmath106 by the same similarity transformation : a = e^q a e^-q .",
    "we can use this latter equation to derive two different relations between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , namely [ identities ] h(x , p)&=&e^qh(x , p)e^-q = h(x , p ) , + & & + h(x^,p^)&=&e^qh(x^,p^)e^-q = h(x , p),it is the second of these identities that we need here , to write z_cl(t)=_-^dxdp  e^-h(x^ ,  p^ ) .",
    "now make the change of variables to @xmath107 ,  @xmath108 , to be treated here as classical variables .",
    "thus , in the first instance ( the jacobian is 1 ) , [ zcontour ] z_cl(t)=_c dd  e^-h ( ,  ) , where @xmath2 is a contour in complex @xmath109 space determined parametrically by @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "that is , the initial contour is ultimately determined by the metric @xmath112 .",
    "whether or not the contour can subsequently be deformed to a standard real phase space @xmath109 is a matter to be determined for an individual hamiltonian . from our preceding discussion",
    "it seems clear that this is not possible in general because of the presence of intervening forbidden wedges .",
    "note that the metric @xmath112 does not appear explicitly as an integration measure in the integral representation ( [ zcontour ] ) of the partition function , only through the form of the relationship between ( @xmath113 ,  @xmath114 ) and ( @xmath22 ,  @xmath115 ) . the issue of the role of @xmath112 in path integrals has been addressed and clarified in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , there are very few cases where @xmath101 , and hence the relations between ( @xmath22 ,  @xmath115 ) and ( @xmath113 ,  @xmath114 ) , are known exactly . apart from the rather trivial case of the swanson model  @xcite ( where in fact standard phase space can be used ) , a nice example  @xcite within the class of hamiltonians of ( [ m<>1 ] ) is the wrong - sign quartic @xmath116 .",
    "a word of clarification is in order here .",
    "the original hamiltonian in this case is really @xmath117 , where the eigenvalue problem has to be posed on a complex contour in the appropriate stokes wedges .",
    "it is only when a particular contour is chosen , with the parametrization @xmath118 in terms of the real variable @xmath22 , that we obtain the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath119 for which @xmath101 was found , namely h(x , p)=\\{1+ix , p^2}-p - ( 1+ix)^2 , where , in the present case , @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath101 operator is q=-+2p , which results , via the first equation of ( [ identities ] ) , in the equivalent hermitian hamiltonian h(x , p)=-p + x^2 .",
    "this is still not a conventional hamiltonian , but becomes so on taking the fourier transform .",
    "it is easily verified that using this @xmath121 in ( [ cpartition ] ) correctly gives the appropriate result ( @xmath10 , @xmath122 ) in ( [ zq ] ) .",
    "this is true whether or not one includes the linear term @xmath123 , which in fact is a quantum anomaly  @xcite proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "if we now make the transformation to the variables @xmath125 and @xmath126 , using the second equation of ( [ identities ] ) , we obtain [ para ] & & = p + & & = x+i(1- ) + & & h(,)=\\{1+i,^2}--(1+i)^2 .",
    "we now have an expression for @xmath29 of the form of ( [ zcontour ] ) , in which the contour is given parametrically by ( [ para ] ) in terms of the real variables @xmath22 and @xmath115 .",
    "however , it is readily verified that there is no obstruction to deforming the contour to the real axis , so that @xmath29 can be expressed as a real phase - space integral . but @xmath127 has precisely the same form as @xmath119 , and we can take the reverse step to the original variables @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "that is , z&=&-2i(1+ix ) + p_z&= & p(1+ix ) , a canonical transformation from @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "for any finite @xmath22 , the argument of the variable @xmath129 is less in modulus than @xmath132 , so that it lies within the wedge including the real axis that guarantees convergence of the integral @xmath133 .",
    "hence the @xmath129 integral can be deformed to the real axis .",
    "however , for the @xmath128 integration ( @xmath90 ) the contour can not be so deformed because of an intervening forbidden wedge .",
    "this is in agreement with the results found previously when we performed the integrals over appropriately chosen rays , to obtain the correct semiclassical result of ( [ zq ] ) .",
    "to summarize , in this work we addressed the quantum and classical statistical mechanics of the class of non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric oscillators of ( [ m<>1 ] ) .",
    "these are in principle related by a similarity transformation to an equivalent hermitian hamiltonian @xmath24 . however , for the quantum partition function @xmath48 one only needs the energy levels of @xmath23 , which we evaluated using the wkb approximation including the first subleading correction .",
    "the main qualitative difference from the hermitian oscillators ( @xmath134 ) with potential @xmath54 turns out to be that because of the factor @xmath41 in the denominator the characteristic temperature @xmath135 of ( [ ctemperature ] ) grows without limit as @xmath56 increases , so that the onset of semiclassical behavior is progressively delayed . at high temperatures the entropy has",
    "the same form as that for the @xmath54 oscillator , except for the different value of @xmath66 , and the specific heat is the same , depending only on @xmath56 .",
    "the semiclassical partition function @xmath71 was determined in the first instance as the high - temperature limit of @xmath48 .",
    "we then investigated how this result could be reproduced by a purely classical calculation , and found that this could be achieved only by extending the classical phase - space integrations into the complex plane . specifically , because of the simple dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath115 , the @xmath115 integration can remain on the real axis , but the @xmath22-dependence means that the @xmath22 integration can only be done within certain allowed wedges in the complex @xmath22 plane , corresponding to different values of @xmath27 . by integrating along the rays at the centre of the allowed wedges we verified that we indeed reproduced the semiclassical result of ( [ zq ] ) . in order to understand this from an alternative perspective we considered the special case of the  upside - down \" quartic , the one example of the class ( [ m<>1 ] ) where @xmath24 is known explicitly . starting with the conventional hermitian formulation for @xmath29 in terms of @xmath24 we implemented the similarity transformation to re - express it in terms of @xmath23 , showing that indeed it required a complex contour in @xmath22 of the type we had previously found .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the classical hamiltonian dynamics for systems of the type ( [ m=1 ] ) and ( [ m<>1 ] ) can be formulated in a real 4-dimensional phase space , while a generalized canonical structure for non - hermitian classical dynamics has recently been derived in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see how our results for the semiclassical partition function can be derived in those formalisms ."
