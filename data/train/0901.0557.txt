    "the dama / nai and dama / libra experiments observe an annual modulation signal in their nai - based scintillation detectors with a statistical significance of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a possible origin of this signal is galactic dark matter  ( dm ) scattering off the nuclei in the detectors of these experiments  @xcite .",
    "the annual variation would then result from the motion of the earth relative to the sun as it passes through the halo of dark matter enveloping our galaxy .",
    "the phase , period , and amplitude of the modulation signal seen by dama are all consistent with dm scattering  @xcite .",
    "we have yet to determine whether the observation is the result of truly new physics , or if it results from an unaccounted - for detector effect or background . in this paper",
    ", we ask the question : what if the dama result is truly a discovery of dark matter ? what could it possibly be ?",
    "the major challenge for a dm interpretation of the dama result is that it appears to be at odds with the bounds on coherent dm - nucleus scattering obtained by other dm direct detection experiments such as cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dama , these experiments search for an unmodulated nuclear recoil signal from dm scattering using stronger background rejection methods .",
    "the bounds they place on dm - nucleon cross sections rule out coherent elastic scattering off iodine nuclei as the origin of the dama signal by several orders of magnitude",
    ". lighter dm scattering coherently off sodium nuclei is marginally consistent with both dama and other experiments  @xcite , but gives a very poor fit to the energy spectrum of the modulated dama signal  @xcite .",
    "an elegant possibility that can account for the signal observed by the dama experiments that is also consistent with other direct detection experiments is dark matter that scatters _ inelastically _ off nuclei  @xcite . in the inelastic dark matter  ( idm )",
    "scenario , the dark matter particle @xmath1 scatters preferentially off target nuclei into a slightly heavier @xmath2 state .",
    "the kinematics of this process can enhance the nuclear recoil signal at dama relative to other experiments such as cdms in a couple of ways . to produce a nuclear recoil signal with energy @xmath3 , the minimum incident velocity of the dm particle is  @xcite v_min = ( + ) , [ vmin ] where @xmath4 is the mass splitting between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath5 is the mass of the target nucleus , and @xmath6 is the reduced mass of the nucleus - dm system .",
    "the distribution of dm velocities in the galactic halo is expected to be approximately maxwellian with an upper cutoff at the galactic escape velocity @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "when the second term in this expression dominates , the minimal velocity needed to produce a recoil energy @xmath3 is lower for heavier nuclei .",
    "this leads to an enhanced signal at dama , which contains iodine with @xmath8 as a detector material , relative to cdms , consisting of germanium with @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of inelastic dm scattering also increases the amount of annual modulation compared to the unmodulated signal rate , further enhancing the signal at dama relative to other direct detection experiments  @xcite .    while idm provides a compelling explanation for the dama signal ,",
    "only a few concrete particle physics candidates have been proposed . a model with sneutrino dm where the inelastic splitting is induced by the lepton - number violating superpotential operator @xmath10",
    "was suggested in ref .",

    "we study the general features required for idm to account for the dama signal and we describe several explicit idm candidates . to remain as general as possible ,",
    "we do not attempt to account for the tantalizing indirect hints for dark matter such as the excess positron and electron fluxes observed by pamela  @xcite , atic  @xcite , and ppb - bets  @xcite , the integral @xmath12 line  @xcite , or the wmap haze  @xcite . in this paper",
    "our goal is simply to understand the possibilities for dama alone .",
    "what if dama represents a true discovery ?",
    "what would be credible candidates for what it could be ?",
    "it would of course be interesting to determine which of the candidates for idm might be compatible with these indirect signals , but we postpone this direction to future work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ fits ] we investigate how well the hypothesis of idm can account for the dama signal while evading the constraints from other direct detection searches for dark matter .",
    "we also argue that several other mechanisms proposed to explain this puzzle do not give a good fit to the full dama dataset . in section  [ general ]",
    "we discuss the general features required for a model to generate idm , and we study the corresponding phenomenological constraints on these features .",
    "we present several plausible and explicit models that can give rise to idm in section  [ models ] .",
    "section  [ concl ] is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "inelastic dark matter has been shown to provide a compelling explanation for the signal in the dama experiments while remaining compatible with other direct dm searches such as cdms , xenon , and cresst for dark matter masses at least as large as @xmath13  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to larger dark matter masses .",
    "such larger masses are of interest theoretically because they can be natural in the context of models addressing the hierarchy problem such as warped geometry  @xcite and supersymmetry  @xcite . in the case of electroweakly",
    "charged dark matter , they also lead to the correct thermal relic abundance . additional attention to heavy dark matter",
    "is due to the recent experimental results from atic and ppb - bets .",
    "we also consider some of the proposed alternative explanations of the dama signal and comment on their viability .",
    "we begin by reviewing the formalism for calculating the expected signal at direct detection experiments from the scattering of dark matter . the total rate of inelastic nuclear recoil scatterings per unit mass of detector per unit recoil energy @xmath3 in the lab frame is = n_t _ v_mind^3v vf(,_e ) , [ rateeq ] where @xmath14 is the local dm density , @xmath15 is the dm mass , @xmath16 is the number of target nuclei per unit mass of detector , and @xmath17 is the local dark matter velocity distribution . for coherent spin - independent dm scattering , the dm - nucleus differential cross section @xmath18 has the general form  @xcite = f^2(e_r ) , [ dsigder ] where @xmath5 is the mass of the target nucleus with atomic and molecular numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the dm - nucleon reduced mass , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are effective coherent couplings to the proton and neutron , and @xmath24 is the overall effective dm - neutron cross section at zero momentum transfer .",

    ", we use the helm / lewin - smith  @xcite parameterization of the form factor . in order to correct for the fact that this parameterization can be off by @xmath27 for larger values of @xmath3 , we weight this by a quartic polynomial fit to the table given in  @xcite , which gives the ratios of the helm / lewin - smith form factor to the more accurate two - parameter fermi ( woods - saxon ) form factor for various elements and values of @xmath3 .",
    "we take the dm velocity distribution to be maxwellian with a cutoff  @xcite , f(,_e ) = e^-(+_e)^2/v_0 ^ 2 ( v_esc-|+_e| ) . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the dm _ rms _ speed , @xmath7 is the local dm _ escape velocity _ in the halo frame , @xmath29 is the velocity of the earth with respect to the galactic dm halo , and @xmath30 is the dm velocity in the earth frame .",
    "the signals from idm are extremely sensitive to the value of @xmath7 , which is thought to be in the range @xmath31  @xcite",
    ". the velocity of the earth relative to the halo , @xmath29 , has components from both the motion of the solar system relative to the halo as well as the annual motion of the earth about the sun , _",
    "e(t ) = _ s + v_o where @xmath32 is the velocity of the solar system relative to the halo  @xcite , @xmath33 is the earth s orbital speed  @xcite , and @xmath34 is measured in years . following the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite and the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are using coordinates where @xmath35 points to the center of the galaxy , @xmath36 gives the direction of disk rotation , and @xmath37 points to the north galactic pole .",
    "the directions of the earth s motion on @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and june 21 ( @xmath40 ) are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the annual variation of the scattering rate due to @xmath43 is very nearly sinusoidal and we estimate the amplitude of the modulated rate to be s .|_mod . when computing the unmodulated rate for a given experiment , we integrate the total rate over the time periods that the experiment recorded data . to convert rates to detector signals , we rescale by the efficiency of the detector and account for _ quenching _ , but we do not include any detector resolution effects .",
    "in addition , we have included a correction for channeling effects at dama , but find them to be unimportant for the range of parameters we consider .",
    "since idm suppresses scattering processes with low @xmath3 , one expects only a very small number of channeled events . ]    to determine the extent to which idm can account for the dama signal , we compute the modulated recoil spectrum of idm candidates and compare this to the energy spectrum in the twelve lowest bins in the @xmath44 range reported by dama in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a given dark matter particle mass",
    ", we use a @xmath45 _ goodness - of - fit _ metric to determine the @xmath46 and @xmath47 confidence level allowed regions .",
    "we define this metric as ^2 _",
    "i = 1 ^ 12 , where @xmath48 denotes the average of the left , center , and right values of @xmath49 in the @xmath50 width bin , and @xmath51 the reported uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "for each value of the dark matter mass , we scan over 2 parameters ( the overall nucleon cross section @xmath24 , and the mass splitting @xmath4 ) , so we require that @xmath52 at the @xmath53 level for @xmath54 degrees of freedom .",
    "we only consider signals from the scattering off of iodine , as it is expected to completely dominate for the parameters of interest to us .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we take the quenching factor for iodine to be @xmath55 .    as well as fitting to the dama results , we also compute the signals that each idm candidate would produce at the cdms experiments  @xcite , cresst - ii  @xcite , and zeplin - iii  @xcite .",
    "this imposes further constraints on the properties of a potential idm candidate . in order to be conservative in excluding idm parameter space",
    ", we will assume that the small number of events seen by these experiments are signal events , and use poisson statistics to find the region of parameter space excluded at the @xmath47 confidence level based on the number of observed events .",
    "cdms has published data from three runs at the soudan underground laboratory with approximate exposures of 19.4 kg - day  @xcite , 34 kg - day  @xcite , and 121.3 kg - day  @xcite . in total , these experiments reported two events between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which we assume to be signal .",
    "we thus require that the expected total number of events , integrated over the time the experiments ran , obeys @xmath58 at the @xmath47 confidence level .",
    "we only consider scattering off germanium as it is expected to dominate for the heavier dark matter we consider .",
    "cresst - ii has published data from a run in 2004 using prototype detector modules  @xcite and more recently has published results from a commissioning run carried out in 2007  @xcite . since there were significant changes to the detector modules between these runs , including the addition of neutron shielding , we opt not to combine these data sets and consider constraints only from the later commissioning run , which had an exposure of 47.9 kg - day and an acceptance of 0.9 for tungsten recoils . taking the seven observed events between @xmath59 and @xmath57 to be signal , we require that the total number of predicted tungsten recoil events , integrated over the duration of the experiment , obeys @xmath60 at the @xmath47 confidence level .    the zeplin - iii experiment has recently released data from a run in 2008 with an effective exposure of 126.7 kg - day  @xcite .",
    "the experiment observed seven events in its liquid xenon detector between 2  kevee and 16  kevee , so we require that the total number of events obeys @xmath60 at the @xmath47 confidence level . to convert measured energy @xmath61 to recoil energy @xmath3",
    ", we use the energy - dependent quenching factor given in fig.15 of ref .",

    "these plots assume the relation @xmath65 . ]    in figs .",
    "[ damafit1 ] and [ damafit2 ] we show the region allowed by dama and constraints from cdms  ii , cresst - ii , and zeplin - iii at the fiducial point @xmath66 for various values of the dark matter mass between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "( note that ultimately the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath22 is model - dependent , but we make this choice to allow a straightforward comparison to previous work  @xcite . ) in addition , we consider escape velocities of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we observe that while the relative constraints from cdms ii , cresst - ii , and zeplin - iii become stronger for heavier dark matter candidates , very heavy dark matter is not ruled out . while both the required cross section for dama and the constraint curves move upwards for heavier dark matter , they do so at roughly the same rate",
    ". one can understand this asymptotic behavior as follows . for large values of the dark matter mass relative to the mass of the nucleus , the reduced mass in eq .",
    "becomes @xmath71 and is independent of the dark matter mass .",
    "therefore the only mass dependence is in the prefactor of eq .   which is the same for all experiments , so the constraint curves from different experiments do not move relative to each other .",
    "it is quite interesting that heavier dark matter may be allowed  this opens up the possibility of simple dark matter models for which heavier masses are preferred for getting the right thermal relic abundance , or for explaining indirect signals such as the @xmath72 excess at @xmath73 seen by atic and ppb - bets .",
    "models addressing the hierarchy problem also often prefer heavier dark matter candidates  @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that the results of the present section depend on a number of astrophysical and nuclear physics quantities that are not fully understood and have large uncertainties .",
    "the size of the modulated signal at dama is particularly sensitive to the local dark matter velocity distribution .",
    "for example , as one can see from figs .",
    "[ damafit1 ] and [ damafit2 ] , increasing the halo escape velocity from @xmath74 to @xmath75 significantly tightens the constraints from cdms .",
    "this is because inelastic dm scattering requires one to sample from the tail of the velocity distribution , especially for lighter target elements .",
    "deviations from the assumed maxwellian distribution at high velocities , as well as additional dm substructures such as streams or sub - halos , can also significantly affect the allowed region  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we have been extremely conservative in identifying the excluded region by using a _ goodness - of - fit _ estimator and only showing @xmath47 confidence level exclusion contours for cdms  ii , cresst - ii , and zeplin - iii . given the uncertainties , it would be premature to rule out a broader range of idm parameter space .",
    "a second important uncertainty is the value of the local dark matter density @xmath76 , which is known only up to a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "varying @xmath76 will affect the overall normalization of the cross section @xmath24 in the plots of figs .",
    "[ damafit1 ] and [ damafit2 ] by a factor inversely proportional to it .",
    "while this is not terribly important for demonstrating the existence of an allowed region , since it affects all signals equally , the uncertainty in @xmath76 can be very important when comparing the allowed region to a model that predicts a specific value for @xmath24 .",
    "finally , we wish to emphasize that the analysis performed in this section ( and in refs .",
    "@xcite ) is not model - independent .",
    "simple models of idm , for example dark matter charged under @xmath78 , will not respect the relation @xmath65 , and the curves in figs .",
    "[ damafit1 ] and [ damafit2 ] will move around by different amounts that depend on the atomic numbers relevant to the experiment . in section  [ general ]",
    ", we will redo the analysis for dark matter charged under @xmath78 , which scatters through @xmath79-exchange .",
    "there we will see that when one considers the heavier dark matter masses that yield the correct thermal relic abundance @xcite , the scattering cross section from @xmath79-exchange is tantalizingly close to the dama preferred region ( which remains qualitatively similar to the @xmath80 case considered here ) .",
    "in addition to idm , a number of other non - standard dm candidates have been suggested as possible sources for the dama signal .",
    "these include lighter spin - independent elastic dm  @xcite , lighter spin - dependent elastic dm  @xcite , and elastic scattering off atomic electrons  @xcite .",
    "these alternatives to idm turn out to be extremely strongly constrained when spectral data from dama is included in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "light @xmath81 elastic , spin - independent dm was proposed as an explanation for the dama signal in ref .",
    "the dama signal in this scenario comes primarily from the light dm scattering off sodium rather than iodine .",
    "such a light dm state would produce recoils near the lower end of the sensitivity range of most other direct detection experiments which consist of heavier target nuclei , strongly suppressing their signals relative to dama .",
    "the effect of light dm on dama can be further enhanced relative to other direct detection probes by _ channeling _ , which effectively reduces the amount of quenching in the dama target , leading to more events in the range of sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent analyses taking into account the modulated and unmodulated single - hit dama energy spectra indicate that this light dm scenario is strongly disfavored . it is found that light dm either does not provide a good fit to the modulated spectrum or predicts an unmodulated single - hit rate in the lowest energy bins that is much larger than the total rate observed by dama  @xcite .",
    "even so , light spin - dependent dm may still be viable if channeling is included  @xcite .    a second alternative explanation for the dama result consists of moderately heavy ( @xmath82 ) elastic dm that scatters primarily off atomic electrons rather than nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of these scatterings would produce an electromagnetic signal in the dama detector in the ev energy range , well below the kev energies to which this detector is sensitive .",
    "however , the scattering of a halo dm particle off an atomic electron with an unusually high momentum in the tail of its distribution , on the order of an mev , can generate a detected electromagnetic signal at dama of @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "no such signal would have been recorded in other direct detection experiments such as cdms and xenon since these experiments are careful to filter out electromagnetic events that they expect to arise from backgrounds .",
    "electron scattering dm is also attractive in light of the pamela results  @xcite , which can be interpreted as coming from dm annihilating preferentially into leptons  @xcite .    following the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite for light dm scattering off nuclei , we investigate whether electron interacting dm is consistent with the modulated and unmodulated single - hit dama energy spectra . in our analysis",
    "we compute the modulated and unmodulated rates for dm scattering off electrons as in ref .",
    "we compare our binned results to the lowest twelve @xmath84 dama modulated bins and the lowest six @xmath85 dama unmodulated single - hit bins using a modified @xmath45 measure .",
    "we use a standard @xmath45 _ goodness - of - fit _",
    "measure for the modulated bins , while for the unmodulated bins we add to the @xmath45 only if the predicted signal is larger than the observed value to allow for an unmodulated background .",
    "this procedure is very conservative in that it will only underestimate the excluded regions .",
    "we find that under the assumptions about the dm made in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely that the dm is fermionic and interacts with quarks by the exchange of a scalar or a gauge boson with @xmath86 couplings , electron - interacting dm as an explanation for dama is excluded well beyond the @xmath47 confidence level .",
    "this occurs for precisely the same reasons that light elastic dm is strongly disfavored : either the modulated signal is too low , or the unmodulated single - hit signal ( _ i.e. _ , the signal excluding multiple scintillation events ) exceeds the total rate observed by dama . in the present case , the signal rate falls quickly with increasing detected energy @xmath61 because the momentum distribution of atomic electrons decreases rapidly in the relevant range , approximately as @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "this tension is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dmemfits ] where we show the best fit ( lowest effective @xmath45 ) to the full dama spectral dataset ( fit a ) , as well as the best fit ( lowest effective @xmath45 ) to the modulated dataset alone leaving out the lowest @xmath88 energy bin  ( fit b ) . in making these fits , we assume either chiral vector ( @xmath89 ) or scalar four - fermion interactions between the electron and a fermionic dm particle of mass equal to @xmath90 . however , the shape of the predicted spectrum , which is the source of the tension with the dama data , is effectively independent of the dm mass provided it is heavier than about @xmath91  @xcite . therefore the curves in fig .",
    "[ dmemfits ] also apply to other dm masses provided we rescale the effective dm - electron coupling strength appropriately .",
    "our conclusion that electron - dm scattering gives a poor fit to the dama spectral data is robust .",
    "we find that it continues to hold even if we do not include the lowest modulated energy bin and the two lowest unmodulated energy bins in the fit .",
    "furthermore , we have also examined other dirac structures for the couplings between a fermionic dm particle and the target electron ( relative to the scalar and vector @xmath92 couplings considered above and in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and we find that these do not improve the situation",
    ". a scalar dm particle scattering elastically off electrons does not appear to work either .",
    "having found that idm provides an acceptable fit to the dama modulated and unmodulated spectral datasets and that other proposals are strongly constrained , we turn now to the general properties of potential idm candidates .",
    "clearly , any such candidate must have an inelastic nucleon - scattering cross section that is significantly enhanced relative to its elastic cross section . to meet these criteria , the mass , inelastic splitting , and inelastic cross section",
    "must all fall into the appropriate ranges .",
    "we now show these requirements can be satisfied by idm particles in the mass range @xmath93 that interact coherently with nuclei primarily through the exchange of a massive gauge boson .      when the dm - nucleon scattering is mediated by a massive gauge boson , the dominance of inelastic interactions over elastic arises in a natural way .",
    "we consider two types of idm in this context : a dirac fermion that is split into a pair of nearly degenerate majorana states by a small majorana mass , and a complex scalar that is split into two real scalars by a small holomorphic mass .    for the fermion case , the models we consider all reduce to    where @xmath94 is a dirac fermion , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is a massive gauge boson .",
    "the majorana masses @xmath97 in eq .   split the dirac state @xmath94 into a pair of majorana states @xmath98 . in terms of these mass eigenstates ,",

    "we see that the dominant gauge boson interaction is strictly off - diagonal , and that the mass splitting between the eigenstates is = m_2-m_1 = 2m_+ = m_l+m_r .",
    "there is also a residual diagonal coupling of the fermions to the gauge boson , but it is suppressed by a power of @xmath100 .",
    "the basic story for the scalar case is very similar .",

    "the holomorphic @xmath102 mass term splits the real and imaginary components of the complex scalar @xmath103 . in terms of these fields ,",

    "another possibility is that the dark matter has multiple components  @xcite , with the local density of the doublet component giving rise to the dama signal well below @xmath137 .",
    "the fermion or scalar doublet dm could also be heavier than @xmath130 or @xmath131 and its density diluted by a late - time production of entropy , allowing for a larger cross section .",

    "large enough representations of @xmath78 ( _ e.g. _ a * 5 * or a * 7 * ) may then naturally have the correct splitting . for a representation of dimension @xmath146 , the dm mass needed to reproduce the right relic density , and",

    "while it would be interesting to study the fits of larger representations of @xmath78 in more detail , we find it intriguing that the simplest possibility of an @xmath78 doublet works reasonably well for explaining the dama data .",
    "if one is to take this model of dark matter seriously , then , the main question is whether the numbers and scales cited above in eqs .   and , though technically natural , have a reasonable origin in models .",
    "that is , suppose dama has indeed discovered dark matter . what would be a reasonable interpretation of this result ? in section  [ models",

    "inelastic dm scattering can also be mediated by a massive gauge boson not existing in the standard model .",
    "two distinct possibilities that can yield the right cross sections are a heavy ( tev - scale ) gauge boson with order unity couplings to standard model fields , and a light ( @xmath152 ) hidden gauge boson with highly suppressed couplings to the sm .",

    "precision measurements at lep imply that the bounds on lepton couplings for a given @xmath116 mass are generally stronger than those for quarks .",
    "for example , a @xmath153 gauge boson would not satisfy phenomenological bounds and allow for a dama signal without unreasonably large couplings to the dm particle or an extremely small gauge coupling .",
    "satisfying phenomenological constraints , even for a gauge coupling to the sm as small as @xmath154 , requires a gauge boson mass @xmath155 . to achieve the dama signal",

    "lighter @xmath153 gauge bosons with perturbative couplings to the dm ( @xmath158 ) are possible at the expense of making the gauge coupling @xmath159 while keeping @xmath160 .",

    "such a @xmath116 must generally be somewhat leptophobic , and have significantly large couplings to quarks and the dm state .",
    "however , we note these couplings are so large that the corresponding gauge coupling generally encounters a landau pole well below the gut scale , even without including the effects of possible exotics required for anomaly cancelation ( which would only make this problem worse ) .",
    "thus , many popular @xmath151 models such as @xmath153 and the exotic @xmath172 s motivated by @xmath173  @xcite do not work if a unification relation is imposed on the exotic gauge coupling .",
    "furthermore , although this heavy @xmath116 scenario is a possibility , the natural connection to the thermal relic abundance that was present with an electroweak cross section is in general lost .",
    "a second possibility for an exotic abelian gauge symmetry mediating idm scattering at dama consists of a relatively light hidden @xmath151 that couples only weakly to the sm .",

    "a coupling  @xcite -b_x^ , where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the otherwise canonically normalized @xmath138 and @xmath151 field strengths , can arise from loops of heavy states that are charged under both gauge groups .",
    "this leads to typical values of @xmath176  @xcite . making a field redefinition to eliminate the kinetic mixing term ,",
    "the sm matter fields acquire effective charges under the @xmath151 .",
    "if the dm states couple directly to the @xmath151 but not the sm gauge groups , the exotic gauge boson can mediate dm scattering off nuclei .",
    "we are interested in the case where the exotic @xmath116 gauge boson is light , @xmath177 . in this limit",

    "thus , for gauge boson masses of a few gev and values of @xmath182 towards the lower end of the reasonable range , the dama signal can arise from idm scattering off nuclei mediated by a hidden @xmath116 .",
    "phenomenological bounds on a light hidden @xmath151 have been studied in refs .",
    "the strongest constraints on a hidden @xmath151 gauge boson with mass of a few gev , coupling to the sm through kinetic mixing with electromagnetism , comes from measurements of the magnetic dipole moments of the electron and muon . for masses larger than about a gev , values of the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath182 less than @xmath183 are acceptable  @xcite .",
    "if the mass of the dark matter particle is much larger than the mass of the light @xmath151 gauge boson , a potential fermionic idm candidate and its slightly heavier partner will both annhilate very efficiently into gauge boson pairs .",
    "the annihilation cross section for this process is  @xcite _ vv ( ) ^4()^2 ( 5.810 ^ -26cm^3/s ) .",
    "note that this cross section scales as @xmath184 , just as for electroweak gauge boson exchange . for reference ,",
    "the necessary thermal dm relic density is approximately @xmath185 , where the additional factor of two accounts for the fact that two different states are annihilating  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are contributions to the annihilation cross sections from the @xmath186-channel exchange of @xmath151 gauge bosons decaying into pairs of light matter fields in the @xmath151 sector .",
    "these contributions depend on the precise field content of the theory , but they will typically be on the same order as for annihilations into light gauge boson pairs .",
    "in general , the correct thermal relic density of a fermionic idm state in this scenario will be obtained for a dark matter mass on the order of several hundreds of gev . for a complex scalar idm state",
    ", there is a moderate additional velocity suppression of the annihilation rate , and a somewhat lighter mass ( but still on the order of a few hundred gev ) will yield the correct thermal relic density  @xcite .",
    "it follows from the discussion above and eq .   that the we can choose parameters to give the correct thermal abundance while simultaneously accounting for the dama signal .",
    "recall , however , that in the case of electroweak interactions this came out automatically for the known gauge boson masses and gauge coupling .",
    "our guiding assumption in investigating candidates for idm is that the interaction between the dm state and the target nucleus is mediated by a massive gauge boson .",
    "though it is technically natural for the mass splitting operator coefficients to be small because they violate a global @xmath109 symmetry , the primary challenge is to generate a small inelastic mass splitting in a reasonable way . with this in mind , we introduce a @xmath109-breaking spurion @xmath187 . depending on the relative charge of the dark matter field and @xmath187 , the mass splitting operator will be naturally suppressed by a factor @xmath188 .",
    "this operator could be used to generate a @xmath189 splitting for a judicious choice of @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "this is not terribly satisfying , however , as it simply parameterizes our ignorance about how the symmetry is broken .",
    "we would also like to understand the physics underlying the inelastic splitting and , given that the masses generally hover around the electroweak scale , fit it together with possible solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the goal of this section is to come up with simple models that can give rise to a splitting of the correct size in the context of a solution to the hierarchy problem without any large tuning of parameters . of course ,",
    "in the end aesthetic criteria are subjective , so we view this section as a compilation of interesting ways to generate splittings of the right size for fermions or scalars .",
    "as we saw in section  [ general ] , dark matter charged under @xmath78 seems particularly promising because the @xmath117-exchange cross section is roughly the correct size to account for the dama signal when one chooses a dark matter mass that gives the right thermal relic abundance .",
    "this is especially interesting for @xmath78 doublet dark matter , which is the simplest possible representation .",
    "however , the size of the mass splitting is then somewhat of a mystery , with scalar dark matter requiring the coefficient of the splitting operator eq .   to be @xmath192 , and fermion dark matter requiring the splitting operator eq .   to be suppressed by the mass scale @xmath193 .",
    "both splittings are smaller than what one would navely expect for an effective field theory valid below the tev scale if @xmath109 were strongly broken .",
    "one simple possibility is that the effects of @xmath109 breaking are sequestered in some way .",
    "this could happen , for example , if the splitting operators are generated by integrating out a singlet @xmath49 through an operator @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the sm higgs field and @xmath196 is the dark matter doublet . in this case",
    ", @xmath109 breaking could be communicated through the singlet .",
    "if the singlet is very heavy , or only couples weakly to the doublet @xmath196 , the mass splitting is suppressed . note that if there are multiple trilinear couplings @xmath194 and @xmath197 , we can simply call the linear combination that couples to the doublet @xmath198 and define the @xmath109 symmetry so as to respect this trilinear coupling .",
    "there are then two ways that @xmath109 breaking could be communicated .",
    "the first possibility is that most of the singlet mass is @xmath109 preserving , with a small @xmath109 breaking piece . for a scalar with the potential - m_s^2 |s|^2 - ( s^2 + f d s^ * h + h.c . ) , integrating out the singlet generates the operator @xmath199 . for a fermion with lagrangian - m_s |s s - ( |s^c s + |d s h + h.c . ) , integrating out the singlet generates the operator @xmath200 .",
    "if there is a natural hierarchy between @xmath201 and @xmath202 , or if the couplings @xmath203 or @xmath179 are naturally small , one could obtain a splitting of the correct size .",
    "the second possibility is that the singlet has a very large @xmath109 breaking mass @xmath201 .",
    "this would , for example , be the only option if the singlet is a real scalar or a majorana fermion . integrating out the singlet",
    "would then generate the scalar operator @xmath204 or the fermion operator @xmath205 .",
    "this is completely analogous to the way small neutrino masses are induced in the conventional seesaw mechanism .",
    "a splitting of the right size could again be obtained for small couplings or if @xmath202 is naturally identified with an intermediate scale .",
    "only a handful of concrete models exist for idm whose nucleon scattering is mediated by the @xmath117 . ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of left - handed sneutrino dark matter in which the inelastic mass splitting is generated through mixing with a scalar singlet right - handed sneutrino .",
    "the @xmath109 violating ( and lepton - number violating ) mass arises through a susy breaking operator @xmath206 , and the size of the splitting is naturally related to an intermediate scale . for related models ,",
    "see refs .",
    "a second possibility for idm are the dirac neutralinos that arise in @xmath207-symmetric susy scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the small majorana mass splitting would then be related to a small amount of @xmath207 breaking .",
    "we present below several other models for @xmath78 doublet idm that make use of a singlet to communicate @xmath109 breaking .",
    "two of these models are based on a warped extra dimension  @xcite , and illustrate some of the ways an inelastic splitting can emerge in this context .",
    "we also present a supersymmetric model .",
    "we begin with a model of fermion @xmath78 doublet dark matter and attempt to explain how the scale of splitting @xmath208 can emerge without any large hierarchy of input parameters .",
    "this requires an explanation for the scale suppressing the splitting operator eq .",
    ", @xmath193 , which could represent the mass of a singlet field that has been integrated out .",
    "one way that this intermediate scale mass could emerge naturally is if it is equal to the planck scale times an exponential suppression factor . as we will see below ,",
    "it is straightforward to realize this possibility in the context of a 5d randall - sundrum model  @xcite , giving the added bonus of combining a natural dark matter model with a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "our model is similar to the models of refs .",
    "@xcite , which realize the seesaw mechanism in warped geometry .",
    "in particular , we consider @xmath209 compactified on @xmath210 with metric [ ads ] ds^2 = e^- 2 k |y| _ d x^ d x^ - d y^2 , where @xmath211 .",
    "if the dark matter derives from a vector - like @xmath78 fermion doublet @xmath212 localized on the tev brane , its mass is naturally of order the tev scale .",
    "however , since we also expect the higgs doublet to be localized to the tev brane , we need to forbid the tev brane localized operator @xmath213 which would generate too large of a splitting .",

    "the key point is that the kk modes all have vector - like @xmath109 preserving masses , and are very inefficient at communicating @xmath109 breaking .",
    "one can see this explicitly in the case of the first kk mode by including the couplings to the dark matter doublet as part of the mass matrix , and solving for the eigenvalues in the limit of a small higgs vev .",
    "for simplicity we can also neglect the dirac mass of the doublet , which plays no role in the communication of @xmath109 breaking .",
    "the mass matrix is then - 12 (    cccc |s^0_l & |s^1_l & |s^1 c_r & |d^c_r    ) (    cccc a_0 0 & a_0 1 & 0 & c_0 v + a_0 1 & a_1 1 & m_1 & c_1 v + 0 & m_1 & 0 & 0 + c_0 v & c_1 v & 0 & 0    ) (    c s_l^0 c + s_l^1 c + s_r^1 + d_r    ) + h.c . , and",
    "the eigenvalues are determined from the roots of the characteristic polynomial @xmath354 0 & = & ^4 - ( a_0 0 + a_1 1 ) ^3 - ( c_0 ^ 2 v^2 + c_1 ^ 2 v^2 + m_1 ^ 2 ) ^2 + & & + ( a_0 0 ( m_1 ^ 2 + c_1 ^ 2 v^2 ) + a_1 1 c_0 ^ 2 v^2 - 2 a_0 1 c_0 c_1 v^2 ) + m_1 ^ 2 c_0 ^ 2 v^2 , where we have used the fact that @xmath355 . in the limit that @xmath356 goes to 0 , there is a zero eigenvalue corresponding to the doublet .",
    "thus we expect that the eigenvalue is proportional to @xmath356 .",
    "plugging in @xmath357 and dropping terms of @xmath358 , we obtain 0 x a_0 0 m_1 ^ 2 v^2 + m_1 ^ 2 c_0 ^ 2 v^2 + o(v^4 ) so @xmath359 , and we see that at leading order the majorana mass of the doublet is @xmath360 .",
    "this only depends on @xmath361 , and is independent of @xmath362 and @xmath363 as we assumed in the estimates of section  [ seesaw ] .",
    "the leading corrections to this formula are proportional to @xmath364 and are suppressed compared to the contribution from the zero mode by a factor @xmath365 .",
    "we have numerically checked that the effects of including more kk modes are also similarly suppressed , and that the sequence rapidly converges after the first few modes .",
    "we also note that this behavior is consistent with the results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we will show that the effective coupling of singlet kk modes to the dm doublet @xmath286 becomes suppressed as @xmath294 for large @xmath190 in the warped scalar model of section  [ scalarmodel ] .    substituting the form of the kk mode wavefunctions eq .   into eq .",
    ", we see that computing @xmath286 requires performing the integral c_n^eff _ r - ^r + d y .",
    "close to @xmath366 , the integrand is completely dominated by @xmath367 . for large argument ( large @xmath190 ) , this bessel function can be approximated as j _ ( e^k y ) ( e^k y - ( + 12 ) ) .",
    "changing variables to @xmath368 then gives c_n^eff _ z_-^z_+ d z z^- 32 ( m_n z - ( + 12 ) ) , where @xmath369 .",
    "the cosine rapidly oscillates over the brane thickness at large n , while the @xmath370 piece is relatively stable .",
    "approximating the stable piece by its central value and performing the integral , one obtains c_n^eff , and then one can place an approximate upper bound the magnitude of @xmath286 , |c_n^eff| .",
    "thus , we see that the magnitude of @xmath286 falls roughly as @xmath294 as we set out to show .",
