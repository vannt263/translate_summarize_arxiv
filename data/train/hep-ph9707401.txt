    "while the standard model continues to provide a remarkably consistent description of essentially all observed phenomena , many physicists think that there must be a more fundamental theory capable of determining many of its features and parameters . to date",
    ", the only quantitatively successful predictions for physics beyond the standard model are the `` unification '' predictions for its gauge and yukawa couplings and for this reason a great deal of attention has been paid to them . at best , the present success of these predictions gives some circumstantial evidence for a stage of supersymmetric unification .",
    "as the measurement of the couplings of the standard model improves , it is possible to test such unification predictions with ever higher precision and the hope is this will strengthen the case for some underlying unification of the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions and shed light on its specific form .",
    "furthermore , the scale of unification may provide us with the first indication of unification with gravity because it is _ predicted _ in string theories with a value close to that needed for unification .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to test these predictions in detail for a class of models which allow for the addition of heavy states as expected in essentially all grand unified theories and/or superstring theories .",
    "the `` unification '' predictions for gauge couplings rest on two premises .",
    "the first is that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge couplings are related at the ( large ) unification scale and the second is that below this scale there is a specific multiplet content .",
    "the first premise follows if there is a stage of grand unification ( @xmath4 etc ) .",
    "however grand unification is not essential . in a ( compactified ) string theory",
    "the gauge couplings are related even if the gauge group is not unified . in this case",
    "the relationship between the couplings depends on the kac moody level used to construct the theory . in the simplest level-1 theory ,",
    "the original string constructions yielded the `` standard '' su(5 ) relationship between the gauge couplings even though the standard gauge group is just that of standard model .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the string theory the scale of gauge coupling unification is determined in terms of the only parameter of the theory , the string tension . fixing this to obtain the correct gravitational strength coupling ,",
    "one finds that the unification scale should be close to the planck scale , _",
    "i.e _ of @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the unification of the gauge couplings of the standard model requires a very large scale of unification of @xmath6 may be considered to be the first indication that we are on the right track when seeking to extend unification to include gravity as in the string theory .",
    "however , one should note that the prediction of the scale of unification of the standard model gauge group couplings applies only to the class of string theory which do _ not _ have a stage of grand unification .",
    "the second premise needed for the unification predictions is the choice of the low - energy spectrum below the unification scale .",
    "the usual `` minimal '' assumption is that this is just the minimal supermultiplet spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "however this is _ not _ the most reasonable expectation .    in any viable grand",
    "unified theory it is necessary to add additional supermultiplets to obtain the required pattern of symmetry breaking .",
    "these additional multiplets are vectorlike with respect to the standard model group , so that they may obtain very large masses of the order of the ( grand ) unification scale .",
    "however , only if they are exactly degenerate with the additional massive gauge bosons of the grand unified theory , will they leave the `` minimal '' unification predictions unchanged .    in string unification , even without grand unification",
    ", there is a definite multiplet content .",
    "we noted above that even if the gauge group is just that of that standard model , provided it is a level-1 string theory , the gauge couplings may still be related at the unification scale as in the prototype @xmath7 gut .",
    "in this case , the breaking of the symmetry is through wilson lines and one may show that the families of quarks and leptons belong to complete @xmath7 multiplets even though there is no residual @xmath7 gauge symmetry @xcite ; this is just as is required by observation .",
    "in addition , specific wilson line breaking allows for an additional light pair of higgs doublets as required in the mssm .",
    "however , like the conventional gut , such string theories usually have additional states , vectorlike under the standard model group , which can acquire masses of the order of the unification scale . in cases with a single abelian wilson line associated with a freely acting discrete symmetry ,",
    "these states must fill out complete @xmath7 representations or come as additional copies of the higgs sector ; no other representations are allowed even though there is no grand unified group .",
    "it is worth remarking that the presence of complete degenerate @xmath7 multiplets does not affect the unification of gauge couplings at one loop and thus , the success of gauge unification applies in this case too .",
    "however , additional massive higgs doublets do spoil the unification predictions at one loop and are disfavoured .    with the minimal spectrum of the mssm and assuming the @xmath7 normalization of the @xmath3 gauge couplings",
    ", one may determine the three gauge couplings in terms of the value of the unified coupling and the unification scale giving one overall prediction ( up to uncertainties due to our lack of knowledge of the low energy susy spectrum ) .",
    "it is most convenient to express this as a prediction for the strong coupling , as this is the least well known of the three couplings .",
    "this gives @xmath8 @xcite including the supersymmetric threshold corrections @xcite , using as an input the well measured value of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is in disagreement with the world average value of @xmath11 @xcite , albeit marginally so . in string theories , as we have already mentioned , the gauge unification scale is also predicted . in the case of the ( weakly coupled ) heterotic string",
    "the prediction is @xcite    @xmath12    more than an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by the mssm .",
    "ways to resolve this discrepancy have been recently reviewed by dienes @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is a recent suggestion of witten @xcite that the ( 10 dimensional ) strongly coupled heterotic string theory ( m theory ) gives a gauge coupling more closely in agreement with the gauge unification value .",
    "it is clear that the precision measurements of the gauge couplings already allow for a very detailed test of the unification predictions and offer the potential of distinguishing between different unified theories . given this , we consider it important to explore in detail the implications for the unification predictions of a non - minimal spectrum at the unification scale of the type to be expected in realistic extensions of the standard model .",
    "as we have mentioned , there are likely to be additional vectorlike states with masses of order of the unification scale belonging to complete @xmath7 multiplets or copies of the mssm higgs supermultiplets .",
    "only if these states have exactly the unification scale mass , will the usual mssm predictions apply , but the difference in the predictions if this is not the case applies in two loop order and may be expected to be small",
    ". we will consider in detail the effects of ( @xmath13 and ( @xmath14 additional @xmath7 supermultiplets which have masses less than the unification scale .",
    "while this does not exhaust the possibilities in grand unified theories , as there may be further higher dimension representations , the method we develop to obtain precision solutions to the renormalization group equations can readily be generalized to such representations .",
    "however , in the class of string theories discussed above , the only states allowed are indeed just those that fill out the five and ten dimensional representations , so the analysis presented here is quite general .",
    "furthermore , it is only in the context of such string theories that the prediction for the string unification scale may be directly compared with the unification scale of the couplings of the standard model .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the mass splitting of the additional massive states .",
    "this is important because it gives rise to threshold corrections to the gauge couplings . in the case of grand unification ,",
    "the splitting comes from calculable radiative corrections and the resulting threshold corrections are of the same order as the usual two loop corrections . in the case of string unification without grand unification ,",
    "the components of an @xmath7 multiplet are not related by the low energy symmetry and there may be additional threshold effects .    in section 3",
    "we develop a method for determining the low energy coupling @xmath15 and the unification scale , correct to two loop order in the running coupling , ignoring the effect of yukawa couplings .",
    "the simplest method is just to integrate numerically the coupled differential equations , technique used in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "however , we found problems in achieving the required accuracy using this technique , so we developed a method in which the calculation is done analytically .",
    "this has the advantage of more clearly exhibiting the important parameters in the calculation . in section 4",
    "we compare our intermediate results with the form presented by shifman @xcite , derived by a completely different method , and show that they lead to same answer . in section 5",
    "we use the analysis to determine analytic formulae for the unification scale , the strong coupling constant and the intermediate scale masses . using these formulae",
    "we determine the numerical predictions and present them in section 6 .",
    "the effect of additional corrections to the mass of the heavy @xmath7 multiplets is considered in section 7 . finally in section 8",
    "we present a summary of our results and our conclusions .",
    "we are interested in the class of models with additional vectorlike states @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 denote complete representations of @xmath7 .",
    "the components of complete @xmath7 representations transform under su(3 ) and su(2 ) groups as follows : for @xmath19 , @xmath20 for the case @xmath17 is the 5 dimensional representation of @xmath7 and @xmath21 for the case @xmath17 is the 10 dimensional representation of @xmath7 .",
    "we note that in string compactifications there are just such additional states left massless after compactification @xcite . here",
    "we wish to discuss how they obtain a ( large ) mass .",
    "since they come in vectorlike combinations , we can write down @xmath22 invariant mass terms @xmath23 where the mass @xmath24 can be far above the electroweak breaking scale",
    ". this term will arise from a stage of spontaneous symmetry breaking through the coupling @xmath25 , when the @xmath26 invariant scalar field @xmath27 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "there is a very natural explanation for the origin of this vev , because the mass squared of the fields @xmath27 will be driven negative by the radiative corrections involving the coupling @xmath28 , in the usual radiative breaking mechanism @xcite .    to discuss this possibility in more detail ,",
    "we consider first the case of a single @xmath29 with yukawa coupling @xmath30 .",
    "the renormalization group equations have the form @xmath31 [ gc ] @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mssm one loop beta function , @xmath40 are given in the appendix and @xmath41 are the gaugino masses which evolve as @xmath42 . also @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 refer to the soft supersymmetry breaking masses of the fields @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , @xmath49 .",
    "the above sum over @xmath47 runs over the component fields @xmath50 for the case one considers both @xmath51 and @xmath52 dimensional complete representations of @xmath7 with @xmath53 .",
    "let us discuss how the field @xmath29 actually acquires a vev , and what the expectation for its magnitude is .",
    "this requires us to solve the renormalization group equations for the soft susy breaking masses @xmath54 ,",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "it is straightforward to solve these equations numerically in specific cases . to determine the general feature , we solve a more simple example , keeping only the qcd gauge coupling and considering the case of a _ single _ component field",
    "@xmath57 which has qcd quantum numbers . solving eqs ( [ mphi]),([rge1n ] ) leads to the result @xmath58 and    @xmath59^{\\gamma_{m } } \\left\\{m_{\\phi}^2(0)+\\frac{2 s_{\\psi}y_{\\psi}^ { * } } { b'_3(\\gamma_{\\psi}-\\gamma_{m } ) } \\left[m_{\\psi}^{2}(0)+\\frac{2 \\eta_{j,\\psi}m_{3}^{2}(0)}{b'_3(2-\\gamma_{\\psi } ) } \\right]\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\alpha(t)}{\\alpha ( 0)}\\right ) ^{\\gamma_{\\psi}-\\gamma_{m}}-1\\right ] \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath60\\right\\ }     \\label{pn1}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the fixed point value for the ratio @xmath65 which can be easily computed from eqs.([gc ] ) and ( [ yrg ] ) .",
    "note that this equation implies that @xmath66 will be driven _ negative _ by the radiative corrections , triggering a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for @xmath29 .",
    "this is the general behavior for our simplified example with one field @xmath57 only .    in the case",
    "that @xmath29 has a `` flat '' potential , ] the scale @xmath67 at which this happens , corresponds closely to the vev that is induced for @xmath29 .",
    "this then gives a mass to the vectorlike fields @xmath17 , @xmath18 coupled to @xmath68 . the important point to note is that @xmath69 is determined by the multiplet content and by the allowed couplings of the theory ; it is not a free parameter . in the case we are considering",
    ", it is easy to determine the order of magnitude of @xmath69 using that @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 .",
    "hence , for large @xmath73 case , appropriate to our use of the fixed points in solving these equations , and with @xmath74 , we get from eq .",

    ", it will occur at the point where @xmath77 deviates from 1 by @xmath78 .",
    "for the case of large number of extra multiplets , this will be very close to the unification scale @xmath79 , so @xmath69 will be close to this scale too .",
    "although , as we have just shown , it is possible that the intermediate scale breaking is triggered close to the unification scale , for @xmath80 of @xmath78 , it is also possible for a much smaller intermediate scale to be generated , corresponding to a much smaller ratio of @xmath77 , its magnitude depending sensitively on this ratio .",
    "even if these parameters are of the same order , the intermediate scale may be much smaller than our initial estimate .",
    "if @xmath29 does not have a `` flat '' potential , then the scale of the vev of @xmath68 is not determined by the scale at which its mass squared becomes negative .",
    "to see this , let us assume the potential with leading term @xmath81 will be determined by the symmetries of the theory .",
    "] , where @xmath82 is the scale of the new physics leading to the effective potential , which we take to be the compactification or planck scale . then",
    ", the vev of @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath83 . since the susy breaking scale @xmath84 is of @xmath85 , this implies an intermediate scale ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 for @xmath88 between 6 and 12 .    to summarize",
    ", there is a very natural origin for the generation of the intermediate scale , coming from radiative breaking .",
    "the magnitude of the intermediate scale is sensitively dependent on the details of the theory .",
    "let us now consider the expectation for individual intermediate scale masses .    for the case of grand unification ,",
    "@xmath7 or larger , the mass terms must be @xmath7 invariant , so there is only a single field @xmath29 and @xmath89 is independent of @xmath47 .",
    "thus , at the unification scale , all components @xmath47 of a representation @xmath17 are degenerate .",
    "however , below this scale , until the scale @xmath90 , radiative corrections will split the mass of the components . for the case",
    "when one can ignore the yukawa couplings such as @xmath91 in computing the radiative corrections , this splitting is generated by the gauge interactions only and is thus easily calculable .",
    "the effects of this splitting is included in the determination of the gauge unification predictions given in the next section .",
    "the case where yukawa couplings are not negligible is discussed below and in section 7 .    for the case of string unification , even without grand unification , the gauge couplings will be unified .",
    "indeed , if the string prediction for the unification scale is relevant , there _ must not _ be a stage of grand unification because the prediction refers to the unification scale for the couplings of the gauge group at compactification scale , and this must just be that of the standard model .",
    "however , without grand unification , there may be different fields @xmath92 responsible for giving mass to the different components of the @xmath7 representation .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason why the couplings @xmath91 should be the same for all @xmath93 s .",
    "let us first consider the case that there is only one field @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath94 leads to a mass @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the vev of @xmath97 the individual couplings @xmath91 get renormalised according to eq([yrg ] ) causing the spectrum to split . just as for the @xmath7 case ,",
    "the gauge contributions ( the first term on the rhs ) are included in our analysis below .",
    "the case the yukawa couplings are large is discussed in section 7 .",
    "this leaves only the corrections which occur if the bare couplings @xmath98 are different and the effect of this is also presented in section 7 .",
    "finally we consider the possibility when there are different fields @xmath92 responsible for the masses of the various components @xmath99 of the representations of @xmath7 . again",
    "radiative effects will change the couplings @xmath100 however , there is a more important effect , because the radiative breaking mechanism giving rise to the @xmath92 vev , drives @xmath101 negative at different scales , generating different vevs .",
    "the terms responsible for this in the renormalization group equations are those proportional to the gauge coupling strength of the component field @xmath47 .",
    "the net effect of this is that the @xmath102 components of the 5 dimensional are heavier than the @xmath103 components , and the components in the 10 dimensional representation are similarly ordered with @xmath104 .",
    "this effect is in the same direction as that driven by the gauge radiative corrections to the couplings alone , but generates a larger splitting between the components . again",
    "the effect of this may be determined using the results of section 7 .",
    "we consider the two loop renormalization group equations for the gauge couplings , with no top , bottom and tau yukawa interaction .",
    "their general form is given by : @xmath105 with @xmath106 and where @xmath107 ; @xmath79 is the unification scale , and @xmath108 and @xmath109 are , in a general notation , the one loop and two loop beta functions respectively , which depend on the multiplet content of the theory . dividing both sides by @xmath110 we may rewrite this equation in the form @xmath111 where we have used @xmath112 to rewrite the second term on the right hand side .",
    "we integrate this equation from @xmath79 scale down to @xmath113 scale , and replace @xmath114 and @xmath115 with their appropriate values . as discussed in the previous section , the mass splitting of the additional @xmath7 multiplets added to the mssm spectrum are generated by radiative corrections . thus to @xmath116 , the threshold effects coming from this splitting need only be included at one loop order ; the two loop terms may be cutoff at the mean mass , @xmath117 of the multiplet .",

    "as we have stressed , the one loop threshold effects @xmath124 are in fact of the same order as the two loop terms .",
    "this is made explicit from the one loop renormalization group equations for the running mass @xmath125 where @xmath126 are given in the appendix and we have ignored yukawa interactions involving the @xmath57 . keeping terms to @xmath127 corresponds to keeping only the one loop running approximation for the couplings , in the presence of extra - matter : @xmath128 using this we may integrate eq([olr ] ) to get @xmath129=\\sum_{j=1}^{3 } \\frac{% \\eta_{j,\\psi}}{b^{\\prime}_j } \\ln\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_g}{\\alpha_j(\\mu_{\\psi})}% \\right]\\ ] ] where we have assumed that all the heavy states get a common mass @xmath130 at unification scale .",
    "one sees explicitly that one loop threshold effects are , in fact , two loop - like effects . as",
    "before we may further simplify this equation to write @xmath131=\\sum_{j=1}^{3 } \\frac{% \\eta_{j,\\psi}}{b^{\\prime}_j } \\ln\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_g}{\\alpha_j(\\mu_{q})}% \\right]\\ ] ] for any @xmath57 , since the effect of the radiative mass difference between different flavours generates terms of higher order .    using eq .",

    "these equations demonstrate an interesting result . at one loop",
    "the running of the couplings depends only on the number of additional states through the combination @xmath138 .",
    "we see that is also true at two loop , even though it is not true for the two loop beta functions , because of the threshold effects .",
    "note that this only applies in the case yukawa couplings are ignored . note also the mild dependence of the functions @xmath139 on @xmath140 .    in order to evaluate the effect of the additional heavy states , it is convenient to compare the results with heavy states to the minimal mssm predictions . in the latter ,",

    "the mssm variables are labelled with an `` o '' index to distinguish them from the model which considers additional complete su(5 ) multiplets .",
    "we follow the general approach and fix , as an input , the values for @xmath142 and @xmath143 which are known with a good accuracy from the experimental values for @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "this fixes the values for @xmath146 and @xmath147 which are then used to compute numerically the value for @xmath148 . as the mssm has been extensively studied numerically , we can take all these mssm quantities as known .    note",
    "that the parameters @xmath149 which appear in eq([mssm ] ) and the parameters @xmath150 which appear in eq([ren ] ) include the constant factors needed for @xmath151 ( which are the same in mssm and our model ) , the low energy supersymmetry thresholds effects and contributions from nonrenormalizable operators at the high scale @xcite . the susy threshold effects are most conveniently included in terms of the effective scale @xmath152 @xcite relevant when calculating the strong coupling in terms of the weak and electromagnetic couplings .",

    "the susy threshold factors are independent of the gauge couplings and thus are the same for the mssm and the mssm with additional heavy states . at two loop order ,",
    "the susy threshold factors do depend on gauge couplings , but the difference between these couplings in the models with heavy states is @xmath156 and thus the net effect is beyond the two - loop order and can be neglected .",
    "the same arguments enable us to avoid the explicit form of susy thresholds when computing other variables of the model with heavy multiplets , like @xmath79 or @xmath157 .",
    "after completing this analysis our attention was brought to the analysis of shifman @xcite derived from a different point of view using holomorphicity arguments and the instanton calculus . here",

    "it is also relevant when considering unification at strong @xmath239 .",
    "this is equivalent to considering that @xmath240 where the right hand side of the latter is a two loop correction .",
    "the solution demonstrates explicitly that the result depends on the number of additional states only , via the parameter @xmath138 .",
    "also , the values of @xmath216 as well as the ratio @xmath241 depend , _ to two loop _ , on _ the ratio _ of the couplings at unification scale only . as a check of our calculation",
    ", one can take the limit @xmath242 in the above expressions to recover the mssm case .",
    "in this section we consider the numerical results given by the expressions of eqs .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , ( [ res4 ] ) , ( [ res2 ] ) , ( [ res3 ] ) .    for @xmath243",
    "the ratio @xmath207 is rather small , though larger than unity ; in the meantime @xmath244 is always larger than its mssm value ; it can not became smaller than @xmath148 because , ] in that case , the additional states would be too light @xmath245 and these cases are therefore disfavoured .",
    "moreover in these cases the two loop approximation breaks down for @xmath246 quite close to its mssm value , because the two loop contributions involve log s of very small arguments , which make their contribution dominate over the one loop contribution .",
    "the case @xmath247 is special because the step used in deriving eq([rge1 ] ) breaks down as it involves division by a one loop beta function which is actually 0 .",
    "this case should be considered separately , even though , interesting enough , the limit @xmath247 in our final results exists and is finite , predicting a larger unification scale , up to a factor of @xmath248 for unification at strong coupling together with a larger @xmath249 .",
    "however the higher order corrections are expected to be very large in this case too so these results should be viewed with caution .",
    "this case has been analysed in detail @xcite , but ignoring the gauge corrections to thresholds which , as we have seen , affects the result considerably .    for @xmath250 or larger the perturbation expansion is well behaved for intermediate values of the coupling .",
    "the results for the unification scale and the strong coupling are shown in figs 1 and 2.one may see that the unification scale is increased , but by a factor @xmath251 for @xmath252 the values of @xmath244 always _ increases _ and are larger than in mssm .",
    "this is in disagreement with the analysis of @xcite due , we think , to errors in the numerical intergration used .",
    "in fact it can be shown analytically that the partial derivative of @xmath253 with respect to the ratio @xmath254 is always positive for any fixed @xmath255 with @xmath256 ( see its expression given in the appendix ) .",
    "therefore , in these cases , the strong coupling is larger then in mssm .",
    "the dependence of the masses of the additional states on the unified coupling is shown in figs . 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "one may see the masses increase as we increase the number of states @xmath140 , while keeping @xmath257 fixed .",
    "note also that for a given @xmath140 , there are two values of @xmath257 which predict the same value of @xmath117 , which shows the advantage of setting @xmath257 as our input parameter instead of @xmath258 , avoiding the ambiguity of the methods having @xmath258 as an input parameter and @xmath259 as an output .",
    "this is particularly relevant when we consider the predictions for large values of the unified coupling .    to summarize , in contrast to previous analyses",
    ", we have found that the addition of heavy states systematically increase @xmath244 taking it further from the current experimental value .",
    "the effect of the additional states does increase the unification scale , but by a factor less than @xmath260 even for the largest couplings which may still be in the perturbative domain . since for unified couplings of @xmath261 the string prediction of eq([su ] ) increases by a factor @xmath262 there is only a small improvement with the weakly coupled heterotic string prediction .",
    "note that the analysis has neglected the yukawa couplings of the third generation which may be important ; their effect is investigated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the analytic results we obtained in sections 5 , 6 refer to the case when the heavy multiplets have a common bare mass , @xmath258 at the unification scale and are split only by gauge interactions .",
    "we found that the threshold corrections introduced by this splitting largely cancel the two - loop corrections in the beta functions leading to the form of eq([hmssm ] ) or equivalently eq([shif ] ) .",
    "however yukawa couplings will also cause the massive spectrum to split introducing further threshold corrections .",
    "fortunately the form derived by shifman , eq([shif ] ) shows that the cancellation persists for yukawa corrections as well and that the heavy states contribute with their bare mass only ; radiative corrections to the masses should not be included if the appropriate two - loop beta function is used .",
    "thus the only effects of yukawa couplings are contained in the @xmath163 factors for the light fields .",
    "this is important because , unlike the threshold effects , these corrections are not proportional to @xmath140 and so we do not expect such effects to be large . there remains the corrections which may occur in non - grand - unified models due to the possible splitting of the bare yukawa couplings @xmath91 introduced in section 2 . in this case",
    "the correction factors to our previous results are given by    @xmath263 _ { old}\\left [   \\frac{\\mu _ { d^{c}}^{o}}{\\mu _ { l}^{o}}\\right ] ^{\\frac{n_{5}}{28}}\\left [ \\frac{% { \\mu _ { e^{c}}^{o3}\\mu _ { u^{c}}^{o4}}}{{\\mu _ { q}^{o7}}}\\right ] ^{\\frac{n_{10}% } { 28}}\\ ] ]    where the label `` old '' used in this section refers to our previously obtained results of sections 5 and 6 and @xmath264 stands for the bare mass for @xmath47 field .",
    "also : @xmath265 + \\frac{3n_{10}}{% 28\\pi } \\ln \\left [ \\frac{\\mu _ { q}^{o7}}{{\\mu _ { u^{c}}^{o5}\\mu _ { e^{c}}^{o2}}}% \\right]\\ ] ] for the change in the strong coupling .",
    "the general effect of this uncertainty requires a specific model for the bare couplings .",
    "however a general feature emerges . for the case of additional @xmath266 an increase in the unification scale",
    "is always accompanied by an increase in the strong coupling . for the case of additional @xmath267",
    "it is possible to avoid this , but only through a very special choice of the bare masses which , lacking a specefic model , looks quite unnatural .",
    "further one may see that the change in the unification scale is quite small for reasonable numbers of additional multiplets unless the bare masses are split by many orders of magnitude . in string theories the differences between the bare yukawa couplings",
    "are typically of @xmath78 for the allowed couplings so it seems unlikely such bare threshold corrections will give a large change to the unificaion scale .",
    "motivated by the structure of many grand unified and superstring theories , we have considered the implications of extending the structure of the mssm by the addition of extra copies of massive vectorlike @xmath268 representations .",
    "these we take to fill out complete @xmath7 multiplets , even though there may be no stage of grand unification . while such representations do not affect the one loop unification predictions",
    ", they can have a substantial effect through their threshold effects and at the two - loop level .",
    "we computed their effects on the unification predictions for the running gauge couplings for the case the additional representations have common bare mass .",
    "we found that they always _ increase _ the value of @xmath253 ( ignoring yukawa couplings effects ) and thus , can not explain the ( marginal ) discrepancy between the predicted value @xmath269 and the observed value @xmath270 .",
    "we also found that the unification scale is systematically increased by the addition of such heavy states .",
    "the increase depends on the value of the coupling at unification and is largest for the case this is approaching the strong coupling limit . for this case",
    "the unification scale increases by a factor varying ( function of @xmath140 ) between 1 and @xmath51 for @xmath246=@xmath271 at the limit of the perturbative analysis . the larger enhancement , allowing for the change in the string prediction at larger coupling , is only slightly closer to the value predicted in the ( weakly coupled ) heterotic string theory",
