    "similar simple formulas that includes a kink angle  @xmath147 and a finite end - to - end distance  @xmath0 in an effective way have also been written down by  rippe or  ringrose to fit their brownian dynamics simulation  @xcite or experimental data  @xcite , but these formulas contain a parameter that must be fitted for each values of  @xmath0 and  @xmath147 from the data points ( fig .

    "analytically we have extended the  shimada and  yamakawa saddle point approximation  @xcite to the case of a bridged and kinked loop .",
    "we have seen that the formation of dna loops is significantly sensitive to the size of the protein bridge when this size  @xmath0 is more than  @xmath194 of the loop length  @xmath4 , that is  300  bp  ( or  100  nm ) for a typical protein bridge size of  @xmath2  nm . to give an example , the closure factor for a 100  bp dna  segment increases from  @xmath195  m to  @xmath196  m. correspondingly",
    ", looping free energy decreases from  @xmath197 to  @xmath198 .",
    "a kink ranging from  @xmath150 to  @xmath154 produces a significant increase of  @xmath18 for dna  fragments of lengths up to about  2500  bp .",
    "for instance the closure factor for a 100  bp dna  segment with a protein bridge  @xmath103  nm and a kink of  @xmath154 is  @xmath199  m , and the corresponding looping free energy  @xmath200 .",
    "a kink also changes the most probable loop length from 500  bp  ( no kink ) to about 175  bp for a kink of  @xmath3 , going to the rigid _ kinked _ rod - like configuration for smaller  @xmath147 values .",
    "this is an interesting mechanism because the loop lengths implied in _ in vivo",
    "_ dna  processing by proteins spread on a large lengths range .",
    "our results were compared to previous analytical approximations  ( in particular the results of the gaussian model , the  wilhelm and  frey expansion  @xcite and the  shimada and  yamakawa formula  @xcite ) and numerical calculations  ( in particular the monte  carlo simulations data obtained by  podtelezhnikov and  vologodskii  @xcite , and the brownian dynamics simulations data obtained by langowski and  _ al .",
    "_  @xcite ) as well as experimental results  @xcite ( _ e.g. _ , the ones obtained by lia and  _ al . _ on the looping dynamics mediated by the  gal and  hu proteins ) . finally a simple formula  ( [ for ] ) including both the protein bribge and kink effects has been proposed .",
    "this formula has the advantage of not containing adjustable parameters with respect to the existing formulas that include both these effects  @xcite .",
    "+ still many effects omitted in this work can be included without significant changes in the numerical algorithm .",
    "the kink we considered is actually permanent  ( that is not thermally excited ) , site specific  ( at half - length ) and rigid  ( @xmath147  fixed ) .",
    "although this rigidity seems relevant to most protein bindings to  dna at first glance  @xcite , it was pointed out in  yan and  _ al .",
    "_ works  @xcite , kinks may also be semi - flexible  ( exhibiting higher or lower rigidities than the bare  dna ) or even fully flexible  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the hu / dna  complex was recently observed to be very flexible under specific experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "flexible hinges were also stated to occur along the  dna due to the opening of small denaturation bubbles  @xcite , such as the one needed by  hu to fit in the double helix  @xcite .",
    "such flexibility could be taken into account  @xcite in our model .",
    "this kind of defects could also be thermally activated , occuring at multiple non - specific sites along the  dna  @xcite .",
    "both effects may be included in our model .",
    "note that using effective persistence lengths could turn out convenient , despite these inform little about the kink properties  ( number , location , rigidity , etc ) .",
    "actually this would be equivalent to study dna  stiffness loss due to sequence effects  @xcite by cutting  wlc in different stiff fragments , depending on the  cg or  at content of the whole sequence to cyclize .",
    "the same approach may allow an approximative study of the  dna polyelectrolyte nature too  @xcite .",
    "otherwise electrostatic potential has to be included in wlc  energy .",
    "twist elasticity leads to slight modifications of the quantum analog we used although requiring some care  @xcite .",
    "this is expected to play an important role in looping , especially when specific alignment of the loop extremities are required .",
    "finally cyclization dynamics could be modeled using a simple two states model where  dna is `` closed '' or `` opened '' , that is cyclized or not .",
    "such study relies on the  ( statics ) cyclization factor we computed in this article  @xcite .",
    "direct comparison to experimental lifetimes measures would be possible  @xcite .",
