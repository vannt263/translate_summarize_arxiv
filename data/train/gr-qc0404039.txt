    "it is well known that according to the singularity theorems @xcite , the space - time describing the backward evolution of an expanding universe is necessarily singular in the sense of geodesic incompleteness .",
    "the generality of singularity theorems also prevents them from giving any information about the _ nature _ of such a singularity for example in terms of curvature invariants .",
    "by contrast , the bkl approach to the issue of singularities asks @xcite : in a neighborhood of a presumed singularity , is there _ a general _ solution of the einstein equation such that at least some curvature invariants diverge ? in this formulation of the question ,",
    "one also obtains information about the possible nature of the presumed singularity described in terms of the _ approach to the singularity_. the conclusion of the long and detailed analysis is summarized in the bkl scenario : generically , as the singularity is approached , the spatial geometry can be viewed as a collection of small patches each of which evolves essentially independently of the others according to the bianchi ix evolution ( for recent numerical evidence see @xcite ) . the bianchi ix evolution towards its singularity",
    "is described by an infinite succession of kasner evolutions ( two directions contracting while third one expanding ) punctuated by permutations of the expanding / contracting directions as well as possible rotations of the three directions themselves .",
    "the qualitative analysis of these permutations and rotations ( ` oscillations ' ) is done very conveniently in terms of a billiard ball bouncing off moving walls and has been analyzed for a possible _ chaotic _ behavior @xcite .",
    "however , it has been well recognized that the conclusion of ad infinitum oscillations of the bkl singularity , a consequence of unbounded growth of the spatial curvature , can not be trusted very close to the singularity where the classical einstein equations themselves are expected to break down .",
    "presumably the equations will be superceeded by some quantum extensions . in the absence of any specific and detailed enough quantum theory",
    "the questions of the fate of the classical singularity vis a vis the behavior of space - time near such a region , could not have been addressed .",
    "the focus therefore has been to include qualitatively expected quantum modification .",
    "for example , in the kaluza - klein picture and more recently the stringy picture , the minimal expected modification is the matter content  notably the dilaton and p - form fields .",
    "higher derivative corrections in the effective action are also expected .",
    "another qualitative implication of string theory namely the brane world scenarios is also a candidate to study implications of modified einstein equations .",
    "all of these have been explored with varying conclusions regarding the bkl behavior , e.g.@xcite .",
    "however , they _ still contain the singularity _ and hence all these modified equations must break down near the singularity raising questions about the validity of the conclusion .    in recent times",
    "this situation has changed , particularly in the cosmological context . within the loop quantum gravity approach @xcite , we do have the detailed framework of lqc @xcite to deduce the nature of quantum effects . due to the underlying quantum geometry @xcite , the internal time ( volume ) evolution becomes a difference equation @xcite and one also has a quantization of the inverse scale factor with a bounded spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus the classically indicated singularity is _ removed _",
    "i.e.  the evolution extends to ` negative ' ( internal ) time and the spatial curvatures remain finite @xcite .",
    "the equations also admit a continuum approximation thereby recovering the classical continuum geometry for larger volumes @xcite .",
    "it is now meaningful to ask if and how the bkl behavior is modified .",
    "there is in fact a hint of what may be expected . for larger volumes",
    ", one can trust the classical picture .",
    "then , in the general inhomogeneous cosmological context , one can approximate smaller patches of the spatial geometry by the homogeneous bianchi ix models . as the volume is decreased",
    ", the patches have to be made smaller to sustain the approximation . _",
    "if _ the bkl behavior were to continue for these individual patches , then the fragmentation into smaller patches must continue ad infinitum .",
    "but the underlying discrete structure can not support such infinite fragmentation .",
    "therefore , the quantum geometry which is responsible for singularity removal , must also ensure that bianchi ix behavior may at the most have finitely many oscillations .",
    "this is in fact a self consistency requirement on the procedures of lqc . as reported in @xcite , the _ self consistency",
    "_ indeed holds and we elaborate the proof in this paper .    the paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "ii , we recall the relevant details of the classical and the loop quantized description of the vacuum bianchi ix model .",
    "we describe the kinematical set - up , the hamiltonian constraint and the definition of inverse triad components including a class of quantization ambiguities .    in section iii , we recall the continuum approximation leading to the wheeler  dewitt differential equation .",
    "we describe how the _ effective continuum hamiltonian _ is obtained and how the most important _ non - perturbative _ corrections from the underlying quantum equations are incorporated",
    ". we also comment on the validity of the effective description .    in section iv",
    ", we display the effective hamiltonian for the bianchi ix model and specify the dynamics with respect to an _ internal time _ obtained by solving the effective hamiltonian constraint .    in section",
    "v , we analyze the potential term in the hamiltonian for internal dynamics . this section is divided into four subsections . in subsection",
    "a , we describe the ` walls ' ( positive potential ) of the potential .",
    "unlike the classical one , this modified potential has a non - factorizable dependence on internal time .",
    "the walls therefore not only move but also change their extent and height , eventually disappearing completely .",
    "subsection b contains a demonstration of the stability of the kasner solution when the effective potential is turned on . in subsection c",
    ", we relate the kasner solution in terms of the internal time to the more common description in terms of the scale factor evolution . in the last subsection",
    ", we specify the domain of validity of the effective description in quantitative terms .    in section",
    "vi , we extrapolate beyond the domain of validity mainly to contrast the usual oscillatory behavior under the influence of the classical potential .",
    "the ( small volume ) asymptotic analysis of this section uses qualitative arguments and proceeds in two main steps . in the first step , we rule out motion in the anisotropy plane",
    "being confined to a bounded region . in the second step",
    "we show that the asymptotic trajectory must approach a kasner trajectory exponentially .    in section vii , we summarize our results .",
    "we also point out the insensitivity of the results to quantization ambiguities and discuss possible implications of the modified dynamics as to the structure of initial and final singularities .",
    "bianchi models are a subclass of spatially homogeneous models such that the symmetry group contains a subgroup with _ simply transitive _",
    "action on the spatial manifold .",
    "the simply transitive subgroups are classified in terms of three integers , @xmath0 , parameterizing the structure constants as @xmath1    bianchi ix class of models have @xmath2 . clearly , @xmath3 implying that bianchi ix is a class a model admitting a canonical formulation .",
    "given the subgroup acting simply transitively , one introduces the corresponding left - invariant 1-forms @xmath4 and their dual , density weighted vector fields @xmath5 , on the spatial manifold @xmath6 .",
    "the 1-forms satisfy the maurer - cartan equations , @xmath7    in the metric description , the metrics of bianchi ix models have the form , @xmath8 while in the connection formulation , the geometry is described in terms of the invariant connections and densitized triads given by , @xmath9 with spatially constant and canonically conjugate @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "note that while the symmetry group ` fixes ' the invariant 1-forms only up to orthogonal transformations which preserve the structure constants of bianchi ix , this freedom can be used only at _",
    "one _ instant of time during an evolution .",
    "the @xmath12 dependence resides in the symmetric @xmath13 in the metric formulation and in @xmath14 in the connection formulation .    in the vacuum case ,",
    "the einstein equations @xmath15 , imply that the matrix @xmath13 can be taken to be _ diagonal _ so that only three degrees of freedom remain in the metric formulation . in the presence of matter ,",
    "the metric is in general non - diagonal .",
    "however , as argued by bkl , near the singularity , the non - diagonal terms do _ not _ affect either the nature of kasner epochs ( time intervals during which scales of spatial distances along three specific directions change as in the case of the kasner solution ) , or the ` law of replacement of kasner exponents ' . instead , these terms lead to rotation of the kasner axes themselves during a change over from one kasner epoch to another .",
    "thus , to study the ` oscillatory behavior ' implied by succession of kasner epochs with changes in the exponents , it is sufficient to restrict to the sub - class of _ diagonal _ bianchi ix , and anyway for the vacuum case this restriction is automatically implied .",
    "one now has only three degrees of freedom in the metric formulation .    in the connection formulation",
    "the situation is analogous . to begin with",
    "one has nine degrees of freedom , @xmath10 but with a three parameter gauge freedom of su(2 ) rotations of the index @xmath16 .",
    "a further freedom , depending upon the parameters @xmath0 , would have been available if the left - invariant 1-forms were not thought of as a background structure in parameterizing the invariant connections .",
    "to get the same three degrees of freedom as in the diagonal metric formulation , one then restricts the @xmath10 to a  diagonal form \" , @xmath17 and correspondingly @xmath18 where the so(3)-matrix @xmath19 includes gauge degrees of freedom ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "such a restriction specifies the _ diagonal models _ in the connection formulation .",
    "this is _ not _ a symmetry reduction in the same sense as restriction to isotropic models is .",
    "nevertheless , these restricted models can be analyzed by following procedures similar to those in the context of symmetry reductions @xcite .",
    "as in reductions to isotropic models , this leads to significant simplifications in such diagonalized models because the gauge parameters in @xmath19 and ( almost ; see below ) gauge invariant parameters , @xmath20 , are neatly separated @xcite .      the basic variables for diagonal bianchi class a models are specified via @xmath21 in terms of the ` gauge invariant ' coefficients @xmath20 with the pure gauge degrees of freedom contained in the @xmath22-matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the components @xmath20 are not completely gauge invariant but subject to residual discrete gauge transformations which change the sign of two of the three components simultaneously .",
    "a diagonal densitized triad has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 are left - invariant densitized vector fields dual to @xmath25 .",
    "being an so(3)-matrix , @xmath19 satisfies @xmath26    the triad components @xmath27 are subject to the same residual gauge transformations as the connection components @xmath20 to which they are conjugate with basic poisson bracket @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the barbero ",

    "we obtain , in fact , a diagonal metric @xmath37    the extrinsic curvature and the spin connection components likewise have a diagonal form : @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 which appear in the relation @xmath41 defining the ashtekar connection components @xmath20 in terms of the spin connection components @xmath42 and the extrinsic curvature .",

    "since the chaotic dynamics is best understood in the classical setting , we worked with an effective classical dynamics from the underlying , singularity free quantum dynamics .",
    "this was done by exploiting the ( always ) available continuum approximation together with a wkb ansatz for the continuum wave function .",

    "( iii ) for smaller volume , these walls just disappear , the potential becomes negative everywhere and approaches zero in the zero volume limit .",
    "qualitatively one expects a simpler , non - oscillatory , behavior asymptotically resembling kasner behavior since the potential vanishes .",
    "we presented the details of the effective dynamics at two levels . in section [ withindomain ]",
    ", we stayed entirely within the domain of validity of the effective model and demonstrated the _ non - asymptotic _ stability of the kasner motion to the inclusion of the effective potential .",
    "the vanishing of inverse triad eigenvalues for small triad eigenvalues was directly responsible for this stability .",
    "in section [ extrapolation ] , we extrapolated the effective dynamics beyond its natural domain of validity into the small volume regime , much as one does in the usual classical analysis .",
    "we proved in detail that for every initial condition , after at most finitely many oscillations , the trajectory will diverge to infinite anisotropies as a kasner motion .",
    "the classical case was also contrasted .",
    "all the proofs work uniformly for all the allowed values of the ambiguity parameters demonstrating the robustness of loop quantum effects .    to explore the possible implications of the results for",
    "the structure of inhomogeneous singularities , let us assume the validity of the bkl picture and divide up a spatial slice into ` cells ' which are approximately homogeneous and have ( initial ) anisotropies parameterized by bianchi ix .",
    "we may picture the so decomposed initial spatial slice as a ` sprinkling of points ' in the bianchi ix anisotropy plane , each point corresponding to a cell .",
    "the approach to an inhomogeneous singularity can now be viewed as evolution of the initial points under a bianchi ix effective ( or otherwise ) dynamics .    when the evolution is chaotic ( as in the classical case ) , two nearby points will diverge away , effectively loosing initial correlations implied by the smooth geometry of the slice .",
    "this needs further decomposition and so on .",
    "asymptotically then there would be infinitely many points performing _ un - correlated _ motion in the anisotropy plane ",
    "i.e. a non - interacting two dimensional ` gas ' .",
    "when the chaotic motion is replaced by asymptotic kasner evolution ( as with the effective dynamics ) , the points will move in a simpler manner getting distributed into the various regions and after some initial crossings between regions they will remain confined to their respective regions .",
    "their correlations , just before this stage , will not be washed away and we will have an ` interacting gas . ' in both cases , all angular sectors are ` filled ' suggesting that a sufficiently large class of inhomogeneities can be parameterized as a distribution of anisotropies to the cells .",
    "( the inhomogeneities would be arbitrary in the case of chaotic dynamics . )    just for contrast assume that bianchi ix dynamics is governed by the negative of the classical potential .",
    "since the walls disappear , this is a trivial way of removing chaos ( by hand ) .",
    "the stable fixed points of the asymptotic dynamics now include all those for the classical potential but in addition the isolated fixed point at @xmath447 is also accessible . now the asymptotic motion _",
    "compatible with the region _ would be to the isolated fixed point . by permutation",
    ", one will have just three possible asymptotic velocities ( along the dips in the classical potential ) .",
    "all the initially distributed points will cluster in these directions and the singularity will look essentially homogeneous .",
    "we will now use these three scenarios , classical potential , negative classical potential , and effective potential , to shed light on the general structure of classical singularities . in the context of the approach to a classical singularity",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the beginning and the end of a universe like ours appear very different from each other .",
    "our observable part of the universe starts out very homogeneous and isotropic , but turns much more complicated in the future .",
    "black holes form and their singularities make space more and more inhomogeneous .",
    "let us now assume that the universe may re - collapse . then by time reversal symmetry the structure of both the initial and the final singularity at the boundaries of space - time would have to be the same .",
    "if the universe does form black holes ( which once formed will not disappear in a classical context ) , then the inhomogeneity implied by their presence will not disappear implying a strongly inhomogeneous structure for the final singularity . from what we can tell by observations of our own universe , then , the situation looks far from time reversal symmetric .",
    "right now space is very homogeneous and isotropic at large scales , and is expected to have been even more homogeneous earlier , while we do not see a reason for it to homogenize away the structure implied by black holes in the future .    the large degree of homogeneity is usually explained by referring to inflation , which expands a small patch of an initial space and thus removes inhomogeneities .",
    "( however , whether inflation begins at all in an inhomogeneous context is apparently an unresolved issue @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the classical bkl dynamics is true , this initial space close to the classical singularity would have structure at arbitrarily small scales which would be difficult to smooth out even for inflation .",
    "if the chaotic behavior leads to a fractal initial state , inhomogeneities would not be removed at all due to self - similarity . )",
    "if the inhomogeneous structure is determined by the chaotic bianchi ix dynamics , then the primordial anisotropies would be completely arbitrary in such a patch",
    ". however , there are arguments to the effect that any such anisotropies would be washed away before inflation ends @xcite",
    ". this would be good for phenomenology in that one does not have to worry about the details prior to the beginning of inflation but then one has also lost any contact with whatever quantum effects that would be present in the earlier epoch .",
    "alternatively , those effects could be influential in determining the beginning of inflation itself .",
    "deciding this may be harder when homogeneous patches are _ un - correlated_. in any case , the classical expectation for the structure of singularities would be consistent with the expected inhomogeneous end , but could be problematic for the beginning .",
    "the hypothetical case of a negative classical potential considered above implies homogeneous structure for the singularity",
    ". this would be quite desirable for the initial singularity since it is compatible with the observed large scale homogeneity .",
    "one may at the most have to worry about the isotropization issue .",
    "however , it would be in conflict with an inhomogeneous final singularity and hence inconsistent with black hole formation during the evolution of the universe .",
    "thus merely removing the chaotic bianchi ix dynamics would not be satisfactory .",
    "the effective dynamics , finally , offers a third possibility .",
    "it admits a sufficiently general class of inhomogeneities ( thereby accommodating black hole formation ) but does not give rise to structure on arbitrarily small scales and retains some correlations among the patches .",
    "this may make starting inflation easier .",
    "alternatively the mechanism of inflation could be very different which will not only homogenize but may also retain some imprint of the underlying quantum dynamics .",
    "the consequences are not worked out at present but it does open up other possibilities to be explored .",
    "in this aspect , matter will almost certainly play a significant role .",
    "the influence of matter on the effective dynamics as well as the other issues mentioned above will be dealt with elsewhere .    while the effective dynamics is consistent with our expectations for both the beginning and the end of the universe , the apparent time reversal asymmetry remains .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the situation is , in fact , time asymmetric due to our own position in the universe .",
    "we can see only some part of it , not the whole space - time , and in particular we see only a small part of the beginning . with the current understanding ,",
    "the observable part of our universe can well be part of a classical space - time with a very inhomogeneous initial singularity . since most of the initial singularity is unobservable , however , it is not discussed further .",
    "the final singularity , on the other hand , is completely unobservable until it is reached .",
    "if we compare only observable properties from within the universe , we simply can not possibly know enough to tell whether past and future singularities are similar .",
    "if we compare the theoretical structure of a space - time from outside , then we conclude that in fact there is no conceptual difference between the beginning and the end of a generic space - time .",
