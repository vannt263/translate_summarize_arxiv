    "supernova remnant ( snr ) and pulsar ( psr ) associations have been widely studied since the first radio pulsar was discovered in 1968 .",
    "associations are usually judged on criteria such as agreement in age and distance , angular proximity , and whether the transverse velocity derived for the pulsar is reasonable . however , an independent measure of the age and distance for the two objects is usually difficult . often , the error in the measurement of the transverse velocity of a pulsar is comparable to the measurement itself , effectively rendering a non - detection",
    ". another recently much - used method of confirming an association is searching for a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) in a snr .",
    "if a pulsar is still inside its parent snr , the high pressure of the surrounding plasma can confine the pulsar s relativistic wind generating synchrotron emission observable as a pwn .",
    "about 50 possible associations of snr / psr have been claimed in the literature ( for a compilation see tian @xmath8 leahy 2004 , and additionally tian @xmath8 leahy 2006 ) , and a few of these associations have been contested ( nicastro et al . 1996 ; stappers et al . 1999 ; gaensler et al .",

    "g351.7 + 0.8 is a shell - type snr first mapped by whiteoak @xmath8 green ( 1996 ) .",
    "it is a faint plateau of emission on the edge of a bright hii region .",
    "gaensler @xmath8 johnston ( 1995 ) suggested a possible association with pulsar psr j1721 - 3532 , which was included in the snr / psr associations catalogue by tian @xmath8 leahy ( 2004 ) . in this paper , based on new radio observations of snr g351.7",
    "+ 0.8 and recent proper - motion measurements of pulsar psr j1721 - 3532 , we give new physical parameters of g351.7 + 0.8 and argue against the association snr g351.7 + 0.8/psr j1721 - 3532 .",
    "the radio continuum and hi emission data sets come from the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) which is described in detail by haverkorn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "the sgps images the hi line emission and 1.4  ghz continuum in the range 253@xmath9 , mostly in the fourth quadrant of our galaxy , with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes 64 m single dish telescope .",
    "the continuum observations have a resolution of 100  arcsec and a sensitivity better than 1  mjy / beam .",
    "the hi data have an angular resolution of 2  arcmin , a rms sensitivity of @xmath101  k and the velocity resolution of the sgps of 1  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the continuum data are taken with the atca interferometer only , which is insensitive to scales larger than 30  arcmin . because the angular size of the snr ( 18  arcmin@xmath12  arcmin in l@xmath6b ) is significantly smaller than this , all remnant",
    "emission is included in the continuum data .",
    "( 0,50 ) ( -85,245 )    fig .",
    "1 shows the image of g351.7 + 0.8 at 1420 mhz from the sgps . the sgps image has a lower resolution ( 100 arcsec ) but higher sensitivity ( @xmath131  mjy / beam ) than a previously published 843  mhz map ( 43  arcsec and @xmath142  mjy / beam ) from the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) ( whiteoak @xmath8 green 1996 ) , so the sgps image shows more faint emission than the most map .",
    "the 1420  mhz and 843  mhz images have similar morphologies .",
    "the flux density of g351.7 + 0.8 is 8.4@xmath00.7  jy at 1420  mhz and 11@xmath01.1  jy at 843  mhz ( whiteoak @xmath8 green 1996 ) , so that the spectral index between these two frequencies is 0.52@xmath00.25 ( s=@xmath1@xmath2 ) .",
    "the parkes 6 cm southern galactic plane survey by haynes , caswell @xmath8 simons ( 1978 ) has such a low resolution ( 4.1@xmath15 ) that a flux estimate is very uncertain due to contamination from the neighboring hii region , but a rough estimate of the flux from g351.7 + 0.8 ( @xmath10  2  jy ) agrees well with the estimated spectral index .      g351.7 + 0.8 does not show any polarization at 1.4  ghz .",
    "as the non - thermal emission from supernova remnants is intrinsically partially polarized , the lack of polarization indicates that the emission is depolarized .",
    "this depolarization is most likely due to varying polarization angle on scales smaller than the synthesized beam , caused by small - scale structure in electron density and/or magnetic field in or in front of the snr .",
    "as snrs at larger distances tend to exhibit structure on smaller angular scales , snrs beyond a certain distance appear mostly depolarized .",
    "comparison with many remnants with known dispersion measure ( dm ) indicates that g351.7 + 0.8 ( dm@xmath16  pc  @xmath17 for a distance of 13.2  kpc , see section 4.2 ) , is expected to be completely depolarized ( kothes & landecker 2004 ) , as observed .",
    "( 60,80 ) ( -235,540 )    ( 50,520 )    ( -210,345 )    ( 50,345 )    ( -245,195 )    ( 65 , 160 )    ( 0,50 ) ( -25,200 )    we searched the sgps radial velocity range from -247 km  s@xmath11 to 165 km  s@xmath11 for features in hi with similar morphology as g351.7 + 0.8 .",
    "there is emission which is possibly coincident with the snr only in the velocity range -10 to -18 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "2 shows maps of hi emission associated with the snr averaged over velocities in the ranges of [ -11.54 , -13.19 ] , [ -14.01,-15.66 ] , and [ -16.49,-18.14 ]  km  s@xmath11 , flanked by two off - line channels . the hi spectrum over the whole velocity range , integrated over the whole remnant , is also shown .",
    "superimposed on each map is a contour of 1420  mhz continuum at 58 mjy / beam , chosen to denote the position and extent of the snr .",
    "3 shows the column density map of the hi integrated over channels from -10 to -18 km / s .",
    "continuum subtraction has been performed in all plots .",
    "using a flat galactic rotation velocity v@xmath18=v@xmath19=200 km  s@xmath11 and r@xmath19=8.0  kpc , we obtain the snr s distance @xmath200.6  kpc or @xmath210.5  kpc .",
    "the angular size of g351.7 + 0.8 is 18@xmath15 by 14@xmath15 ( average diameter 16@xmath15 ) , so this yields a radius of about 6 pc ( @xmath22  kpc ) or 30.7  pc ( @xmath23  kpc ) for the snr . from the column density of the hi associated with g351.7 + 0.8 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , we estimate an approximate n@xmath24 of @xmath25@xmath26  @xmath27 , so the approximate density n@xmath19=n@xmath24/(2r ) is about 7.8  @xmath17 ( @xmath22  kpc ) or 1.6 @xmath17 ( @xmath23  kpc ) .",
    "an ism density of 7.8  @xmath17 is so high that we should have seen hi piled up in a clear shell around the snr , which is not seen in fig .",
    "the absence of such a shell means g351.7 + 0.8 is most likely at the farther distance of 13.2  kpc .    applying a sedov model ( cox 1972 ) , for a typical explosion energy of @xmath28@xmath29  erg ( @xmath30  erg)=2/3 ) , yields an age of 1.4@xmath610@xmath31  yr for @xmath23  kpc .    because the sedov phase only lasts for several 10,000 years",
    ", the snr would have completely cooled by that time for n@xmath32=1.6  @xmath17 .",
    "the shock radius when the snr has cooled is @xmath33=24.3(@xmath34)@xmath35  pc .",
    "because the remnant would show a thin , bright shell if it was older than a cooling time , contrary to observations , we require that the snr age is smaller than the cooling time , i.e.  r@xmath36 .",
    "thus we find an upper limit for n@xmath19 of 0.4 @xmath17 .",
    "this is consistent with a hi column density of about 0.8@xmath6@xmath37 , roughly consistent with fig .",
    "the revised age for g351.7 + 0.8 with n@xmath19@xmath130.4 @xmath17 is less than 6.8@xmath610@xmath7 yr .      pulsar j1721 - 3532 ( l=351.69@xmath38 , b=0.67@xmath38 ) is situated at a slightly lower latitude than snr g351.7 + 0.8 and obscured by a small hii region .",
    "it has a characteristic age of 178  kyr ( taylor et al .",
    "1993 ) and a dm distance of 5.6 kpc based on the electron density model of cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) .",
    "the pulsar is shown by the white cross in fig .  1 , where the arrow denotes its proper motion direction .",
    "the angular separation between the pulsar and the centre of the snr is @xmath1010@xmath15 .",
    "weisberg et al . ( 1995 ) gave a lower limit to the distance of the pulsar of 4.8@xmath00.3 kpc from hi absorption spectra .",
    "although no distance and age are available for snr g351.7 + 0.8 , gaensler and johnston ( 1995 ) mentioned a possible association of snr g351.7 + 0.8 with psr j1721 - 3532 based on their @xmath39 parameter method , i.e. , their calculations showed a pulsar this old could have traveled outside the snr in its lifetime .",
    "however , the snr s parameters given in the paper make this association unlikely .",
    "the cordes @xmath8 lazio ( 2002 ) electron density model yields dm  @xmath16  pc  @xmath17 for the snr at a distance of 13.2  kpc .",
    "the estimated distance error in the dm values is about 5  per  cent in this direction ( cordes @xmath8 lazio 2002 ) .",
    "the pulsar j1721 - 3532 has a dm of 496@xmath40  pc  @xmath17 , which is widely inconsistent with the dm estimate for the snr .",
    "a pulsar proper motion measurement is a good way to support snr / psr associations or disprove candidate associations .",
    "recent timing measurements ( zou et al .",
    "2005 ) gave psr j1721 - 3532 s proper motion 7200@xmath02400 km  s@xmath11 at a distance of 5.6  kpc ( @xmath41=-43@xmath024 @xmath42  yr@xmath11 , @xmath43=-270@xmath093",
    "@xmath42  yr@xmath11 ) .",
    "zou et al.s ( 2005 ) proper motion measurements are based upon comparing two position estimates ( probably including a significant underestimate of position uncertainties ) and cite large errors which are probably related with a lot of timing noise from the pulsar , adding to the position uncertainty .",
    "however , the proper motion direction is still more or less similar if the true values of the velocity are within 2@xmath44 from the cited value , which adds weak evidence against the association psr j1721 - 3532/snr g351.7 + 0.8 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .      g351.7 + 0.8 is an old snr , its soft x - ray emission is not expected to be bright in a lower density environment , and should have been completely absorbed at a distance of 13.2  kpc .",
    "this is consistent with lack of detection within g351.7 + 0.8 in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "there is an unidentified , faint x - ray point source , listed by voges et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as 1rxs j172055.3 - 353937 .",
    "it is centred on @xmath45=351.52@xmath38 , @xmath46=0.71@xmath38 , and lies close to the southeastern edge of g351.7 + 0.8 .",
    "this x - ray source has a total of 6 counts in the rosat all - sky survey , not enough to deduce any spectral information .",
    "the source does not seem to have an optical counterpart .",
    "it may coincide with a hard x - ray source in fig .  2 of ezoe et al ( 2006 ) , possibly indicating a large distance at which soft x - rays have been absorbed .",
    "obviously , deeper x - ray observations are needed .",
    "if it is confirmed to be a neutron star later , it is reasonable to associate g351.7 + 0.8 with 1rxs j172055.3 - 353937 .",
    "we present new images of the snr g351.7 + 0.8 from the 1.4  ghz radio continuum and hi emission dataset from the sgps .",
    "its continuum flux density at 1.4  ghz is 8.4@xmath00.7 jy and its spectral index is 0.52@xmath00.25 .",
    "based on associated hi emission , the remnant s distance is estimated to be @xmath47  kpc .",
    "no polarization is detected , consistent with the expectation of complete depolarization at this distance towards the galactic centre .",
    "based on the assumption that the remnant must be younger than a cooling time , its age is younger than @xmath48  yrs , and the ambient ism density is @xmath49  @xmath17 .",
    "discrepancies in distance and dispersion measure , and a tentative proper motion measurement of pulsar j1721 - 3532 , make an association between the two objects snr g351.7 + 0.8 and psr j1721 - 3532 unlikely . a faint unidentified x - ray point source , 1rxs j172055.3 - 353937 , is a potential candidate to be associated with g351.7 + 0.8 .",
