    "for many years , there has been ample evidence that bulges of barred spiral galaxies ( sb bulges ) are triaxial @xcite .",
    "a spiral galaxy can not have an oblate spheroidal bulge if the position angles of the major axes of the bulge , bar and disk are all different unless the bulge is tipped with respect to the plane of the disk .",
    "given that observations of edge on galaxies show that bulges are rather flat , it is most likely that the shortest axis is perpendicular to the plane of the disk .    using stellar kinematic data , @xcite",
    "provide evidence that many sa bulges ( in unbarred galaxies ) are rotationally flattened , and consistent with being oblate spheroids . however , there is also photometric and kinematic evidence to show that triaxial bulges may be common in unbarred galaxies . in a similar way to barred galaxies ,",
    "a misalignment between the apparent major axes of the bulge and the disk is an indicator of triaxiality , as is a twisting of the inner bulge isophotes with respect to those of the disk .",
    "these effects have been seen in and in a sample of 10 unbarred galaxies .",
    "stronger evidence for triaxiality comes from combining photometry with kinematic data . in an non - axisymmetric potential ,",
    "the shape of the rotation curve will depend on the position of the line of sight and the major axis of the non - axisymmetric component . a slowly rising rotation curve or one in which a bump of extreme velocities is seen near the centre are indications of triaxiality .",
    "by comparing the theoretical gas velocity field derived from a triaxial potential with the observed kinematic data , one can determine whether or not the assumption of triaxiality is justified .",
    "triaxiality has been demonstrated for both and for our galaxy .",
    "it is important to know whether triaxiality is common in sa bulges , since any asymmetries in the underlying potential of the inner galaxy have a large effect on the motions of interstellar gas and could provide a method of transporting gas into galaxy cores .",
    "hence , triaxial bulges could provide clues to the fueling of central starbursts and active galactic nuclei .",
    "furthermore , large scale movement of gas within a spiral galaxy could lead to changes in the overall morphology .",
    "in particular , a build up of gas in the galactic centre can result in the creation of a bar or its destruction .",
    "triaxial bulges can also help to constrain the masses of dark halos in galaxies .",
    "kinematic observations contain the best evidence for the existence of dark halos .",
    "flat rotation curves imply that the mass distribution in a galaxy must extend well beyond the observed stellar or gaseous distributions .",
    "however , in an axisymmetric galaxy it is not possible to determine how much of the mass of the galaxy resides in the disk and how much in the halo .",
    "many rotation curves can be fitted by models ranging from zero - mass disks to ` maximum disks ' , that is disks that are as massive as possible whilst ensuring that the halo is not hollow .",
    "the velocity fields of barred galaxies provide extra information that can be used to break the disk - halo degeneracy .",
    "large jumps in velocity are an indication of triaxiality ( either bar or bulge ) .",
    "these velocity jumps can help to determine a mass model for the non - axisymmetric component . assuming a spherical halo , this can then be used to constrain the mass - to - light ratio of the disk and the mass fraction of the halo .",
    "there is both photometric and kinematic evidence for triaxiality in , the galaxy .",
    "@xcite noted that the apparent major axes of bulge and disk are misaligned and that the central isophotes are twisted with respect to the isophotes of the outer disk .",
    "he attributed this to the presence of a triaxial bulge rotating in the plane of the disk .",
    "@xcite showed that the ` lindblad twist ' is generated by a one parameter family of triaxial models of the bulge of , where the parameter , @xmath4 , is the angle between the major axis of the bulge and the line of nodes of the disk .",
    "in addition , many observations of interstellar gas have detected anomalously high velocities in both @xmath5 atomic gas and co molecular gas in the central @xmath6 of .",
    "@xcite showed that these velocities would occur in a simple , analytic , rotating barred potential by calculating closed , non - intersecting , periodic orbits in the plane of the disk and arguing that interstellar gas would largely follow these orbits .",
    "this paper aims to build on the work of @xcite and @xcite in two ways .",
    "the potential of the bulge is derived from observations , using the method of @xcite and the surface brightness profile of @xcite whilst the gas flows are modelled using a 2d , isothermal , hydrodynamics code .",

    "the galaxy has been studied for over a thousand years .",
    "it is one of the few galaxies which can be seen with the naked eye and was mentioned by abu i - husain al - sufi in his _",
    "book on the constellations of the fixed stars _ in 964 ad . as the closest large spiral to our own galaxy , provides us with an ideal laboratory for probing the structure and dynamics of spiral galaxies . due to its close proximity ,",
    "high resolution photometric observations are available of both the stellar and gaseous components .",
    "these include maps in _ u _ , _ v _ , _ b _ and _ r _ bands , @xmath5 and co .",
    "its large inclination angle ( @xmath7 ) means that although it is difficult to determine accurate positional data on its apparent minor axis , more information is available on the kinematics of the galaxy .",

    "@xmath9 orbits exist at all radii and are elongated along the bulge major axis . @xmath10",
    "orbits exist inside the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) and are oriented perpendicular to the major axis . in the model of minimum @xmath11 , these effects can be seen in panel  ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : best ] , where gas near the outline of the bulge is moving in orbits elongated along the major axis . near the centre of the bulge , the gas flows along orbits elongated along the minor axis .",
    "when gas falls inwards and passes the ilr , it shifts from @xmath9 to lower energy @xmath10 orbits . in doing so",
    ", it creates the ` spray ' region seen as the diagonal gas flows just above and to the right and below and to the left of the centre in panel  ( b ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : best ] .",
    "since this area contains transient gas which is not on any periodic orbits , it is an area of very low density and corresponds to the low density regions in panel  ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : best ] .",
    "as the gas travels through the ` spray ' region , it slows down and climbs out of the bulge s potential well . at the end of the ` spray ' region",
    ", the gas reaches its minimum kinetic energy , abruptly changes direction and follows the gas it has encountered back down into the potential well .",
    "this abrupt change in velocity is seen in panel  ( b ) of fig .",

    "the solid ellipse in each panel marks the extent of the bulge and the greyscale is minus the divergence of the velocity , highlighting the shocks .",
    "the top two panels panels ( a ) and ( b ) are the slower bulges ( @xmath3 = 1.4 and @xmath25 = 50 and 52 ) whereas ( c ) and ( d ) are faster ( @xmath3 = 1.0 and @xmath25 = 70 and 77 ) .",
    "the left hand panels , ( a ) and ( c ) , describe lighter bulges ( @xmath1 = 5.5 ) and the two on the right , panels ( b ) and ( d ) describe heavier bulges ( @xmath1 = 7.5 ) .",
    "a comparison of the top two panels with the bottom two shows the effect of a faster bulge on the shock morphology .",
    "a faster bulge has a smaller co - rotation radius and radius of the ilr at which gas transfers between @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbits . since this transfer of gas between families of periodic orbits is the primary cause of the shocks seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] , we see that fast bulges have shocks which occur closer to their centres .",
    "this is the case irrespective of whether the bulge is heavy or light .",
    "the faster bulges also have pronounced secondary shocks , which emerge near the end of the major axis of the bulge .",
    "the left hand panels ( a ) and ( c ) show the lighter bulges . in comparison with the heavier bulges of panels ( b ) and",
    "( d ) , they have weaker shocks . the shocks for the lighter bulges are also slightly closer to the centre and slightly straighter than for the heavier ones .",
    "the observational data used to judge the success of the simulations is co data from @xcite .",
    "the molecular gas is likely to be confined to the plane of the disk and follow the periodic orbits described above .",
    "co is a good tracer of the majority of molecular gas in a galaxy , particularly in the case of .",
    "hence , it is amenable to modelling using isothermal hydrodynamics .",
    "however , although there have been recent co maps made of most of the galaxy ( loinard et al . 1999 , dame et al . 1993 ) , there is very little co data available in the central bulge region .",
    "the reason for this deficiency in data could be that the co is very cold and difficult to detect in the inner disk or simply not there .",
    "the data from @xcite were taken using the 30-m iram millimeter radio telescope in 1993 .",
    "26 positions along the apparent major axis of were surveyed and co was detected in 16 of them with a resolution of 35@xmath26 2.6  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "all 16 data points are used in the comparison with the models .",
    "each model was rotated by @xmath4 and inclined by @xmath27 to match the viewing position on the sky .",
    "a cut was then taken along the line of nodes of the disk , involving an interpolation from off - axis positions , and a comparison made with the co data .",
    "[ fig : coobs ] shows a comparison between the output of the best fit model and the co data .",
    "the model fits the data quite well except for one point at @xmath28  =  -21.6@xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30  =  -422.4  km  s@xmath17 which can not be fit using the model described above .",
    "this anomalous point may be due to a molecular cloud orbiting above the plane of the disk .",
    "in this case , its line of sight velocity would be smaller than if it moved in the plane , since it would be partly moving in the @xmath8 direction .    to make a quantitative statement about how good a fit a particular model is and which model gives the best fit to the data ,",
    "a likelihood function is derived , where the errors in the position and velocity of the co data are assumed to be gaussian .",
    "given that there are errors in both @xmath28 and @xmath30 , the difference between the data and the model is found by comparing each datum with the point in the model which is closest to it .",
    "this takes place within error space , where all distances are divided by the error on @xmath31 and all velocities by the error on @xmath30 ( 2.6 ) .",
    "this procedure gives a value of @xmath11 for each model and a simple method of ascertaining the model of minimum @xmath11 .",
    "for this model , @xmath4  =  15@xmath22 , @xmath1  =  6.5 , @xmath3  =  1.2 and @xmath11 = 4.7 or 2.7 with or without the far flung data point respectively .",
    "given the various assumptions that have gone into this model , it is unlikely that values much closer to @xmath11  =  1 could be attained .",
    "table  [ bestfit ] provides details of the parameters of this model .",
    "contour plots of @xmath11 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] for @xmath3  =  1.0 , 1.2 and 1.4 . in each plot , the value for the bulge mass - to - light ratio is constrained to 0.5 either side of the best fit model value at the 90% confidence level .",
    "however , as the value of @xmath3 rises from 1.0 to 1.4 , @xmath4 becomes less well constrained .",
    "this effect happens concurrently with a narrower spread of pattern speeds .",
    "the result is that the pattern speed varies by 3 or 4  km  s@xmath17  kpc@xmath17 in each of the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] in the 90% confidence regions .    fig .",
    "[ fig : contphi ] shows the value of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath3 at a constant value of @xmath4  =  18@xmath22 .",
    "although the plot was only constructed at a single value of @xmath4 , it does indicate that the favoured value of @xmath3 lies between 1.1 and 1.3 .",
    "this shows that the bulge of is a fast rotator .",
    "combining all of the above results implies that , at the 90% confidence level , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "unfortunately , the derived values of @xmath35 are not very robust . using the above method",
    ", it is possible to vary the value of @xmath35 by two simply by taking the result of a particular model at four rather than at three bar rotations .",
    "this is enough to turn a model which fits the data very well into one which is a much worse fit .",
    "therefore it becomes much more difficult to determine whether a particular model is a good representation of or not and how well the above results can be trusted .",
    "a much stronger case could be made if more off axis co data was available in the inner regions of . in order to anticipate such observations ,",
    "i have provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : cooff ] a set of predictions from the model of minimum @xmath11 for off axis gas velocities , for comparison with observations .",
    "all predictions are for cuts parallel to the major axis , taken at 1@xmath24 intervals from 0@xmath24 to 4@xmath24 inclusive .",
    "these results were all calculated using a distance to of 690 kpc for ease of comparison with previous work . however , using recent results from hipparcos , @xcite deduce that the distance is 784 kpc . adopting this value means that 1@xmath24  =  230  pc .",
    "lengths , whether observed or deprojected and the mass of the bulge , all scale in proportion to the distance whereas the central density scales as the inverse square of the distance to .",
    "as mentioned above , the axisymmetric component is assumed to comprise a disk and any halo which exists in .",
    "this was done to reduce the number of free parameters in the model whilst remaining true to the observations .",
    "however , it is extremely important to determine what fraction by mass of the inner region of consists of dark matter .",
    "the inner region of is defined here as a sphere inscribed by the semi - major axis of the bulge of the minimum @xmath11 model i.e. a sphere of radius 3.5 kpc .    in order to do this , the total circular speed curve of the model of minimum @xmath11 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cvel ] , is taken to represent the combined mass distribution of the bulge , disk and halo .",
    "hence , the total mass at 3.5  kpc , @xmath36  =  2.2  @xmath14  10  @xmath37 .",
    "the contribution of the bulge to this has already been deduced to be 8.1@xmath38  10@xmath39 , however there remains a degeneracy between the contributions of the disk and the halo .",
    "one method of breaking this degeneracy is to represent the halo by an nfw profile derived from cosmological @xmath40-body simulations ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a characteristic density , @xmath43  =  @xmath44 is a characteristic radius and @xmath45 is a dimensionless concentration parameter .",
    "@xmath46 is the radius within which the mean density of the halo is 200 @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the critical density of the universe , @xmath49  =  @xmath50 is hubble s constant , @xmath51  =  100   and @xmath52 is taken to be 0.75 .",
    "the circular velocity curve for an nfw profile is given by    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the velocity at @xmath46 and @xmath55  =  @xmath56 . from @xcite , at a redshift @xmath8  =  0 ,    @xmath57    hence , for a given value of hubble s constant , the halo circular speed curve is fully specified by @xmath54 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite find a relationship between the characteristic density and radius ( or , equivalently , between @xmath45 and @xmath54 ) of a halo in a given cosmology , thereby reducing the nfw profiles to a one parameter family .",
    "if @xmath54  =  @xmath58  =  257  , then the method of @xcite gives a halo mass fraction at 3.5 kpc of 58% and a disk mass of only 5.8  @xmath14  10@xmath39 .",
    "however , @xcite state that the maximum rotation velocity can be as high as @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath54  =  @xmath60  =  184  , the halo mass fraction at 3.5 kpc falls to 44% and the disk mass rises to 7.8  @xmath14  10@xmath39 .",
    "but in either case , the inner region of would be heavily dark matter dominated if nfw halo profiles are to be believed .",
    "@xcite convincingly demonstrate that fast , long lived bars can not co - exist with massive dark halos .",
    "their argument is based on the idea that dynamical friction from a dense , dark matter halo slows down any rapidly rotating bar .",
    "hence , any old bar which is found to be a fast rotator precludes the existence of a dark halo , other than one with the lowest possible central density consistent with not being hollow .    ` fast ' bars have @xmath61 and , of the few galaxies where @xmath3 has been measured , all have fallen within this range implying that all barred galaxies have minimal halos and , hence , maximum disks . further , unless the distribution of halo densities is bimodal , this conclusion of minimum halos should be extended to all spiral galaxies .",
    "since the model of minimum @xmath11 for has @xmath3  =  1.2 and the bulge of m31 is older than 6 gyr , must have a low density dark matter halo and a maximum disk .",
    "the exact value of the halo mass fraction inside 3.5 kpc is dependent on the profile adopted for disk and halo , even for a maximum disk .",
    "the maximum disk model of @xcite implies a halo mass fraction of just 0.5% at 3.5 kpc and , although the model of minimum @xmath11 is unable to make such a quantitative prediction , it is clearly at odds with the nfw halo predicted by cdm .",
    "the mass distribution for the bulge of has been determined from observations of the bulge surface brightness profile .",
    "the bulge is triaxial and rotates about the same axis as the disk .",
    "the galahad code , based on the fs2 algorithm , has been used to reproduce observations of co position and velocity in the bulge of the unbarred galaxy , particularly the extreme velocities which appear in the central @xmath6 .    by matching the model gas velocity field to the observations , it has been possible to constrain the @xmath0-band bulge mass - to - light ratio , @xmath1 , and the bulge pattern speed , @xmath25 , at the 90% confidence level , to @xmath62 and 51 @xmath63 55 .",
    "the angle between the major axis of the bulge and the line of nodes of the disk has been constrained to @xmath32 . for the model of minimum @xmath11 , @xmath1  =  6.5 , @xmath64  =  1.2 , the semi - major axis @xmath23  =  3.5  kpc and @xmath4  =  15@xmath22 .",
    "the procedure described above improves on previous bulge models by constructing the mass distribution from observations .",
    "further , the use of a hydrodynamics code to determine the response of the gas to the underlying potential provides a more accurate representation of the gas velocity field than calculations of periodic orbits .",
    "however , the oscillations inherent in a hydrodynamic model of a galaxy limit the accuracy of any simulation and may lead to more slack in the predictions than the formal errors imply .",
    "if the bulge really is triaxial , it should be possible to constrain its parameters further by attempting to observe the offset dust lanes that should accompany the gas shocks described above .",
    "an absorption map has been provided to assist dust lane observations .    since",
    "the bulge of has been shown to be a fast rotator , it follows from @xcite that has a maximum disk and a halo mass fraction within 3.5 kpc of just a few percent .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the predictions of @xcite , which imply that the halo mass fraction within 3.5   kpc is between 44% and 58% .",
    "these conclusions would be strengthened by the confirmation of the off axis gas velocity predictions which have been made above .",
    "this could be done by confronting the model with further co observations of the central 15@xmath24 of .",
