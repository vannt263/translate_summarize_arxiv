    "recent observations of high - energy emission from a few shell - type supernova remnants ( stsnrs ) advance our understanding of the underlying physical processes significantly @xcite .",
    "these observations not only give high quality emission morphology and spectra @xcite , which lead to tight upper limits on thermal x - rays , but also discover x - ray variability on a timescale of a few months @xcite , which is intimately connected to processes near the shock front ( sf ) . the radio to x - ray emissions are produced by relativistic electrons through the synchrotron processes .",
    "the nature of the tev emission is still a matter of debate .",
    "the major challenges to the hadronic scenario include : 1 ) the lack of correlation between the tev emission and molecular cloud distribution ; 2 ) the requirement of very high mean target gas density , supernova explosion energy , and/or proton acceleration efficiency , which implies efficient magnetic field amplification in the context of the diffusive shock acceleration and strong suppression of the electron acceleration @xcite ; 3 ) the good correlation between the x - ray and tev emission @xcite , which suggests a leptonic scenario . because secondary leptons from hadronic processes wo nt produce as much radiation power as @xmath0-rays from neutral pion ( @xmath1 ) decays @xcite , the fact that the x - ray luminosity is slightly higher than the tev luminosity requires that most leptons be accelerated from the background plasma .",
    "compared to the hadronic scenario , the leptonic scenario has much fewer parameters and is well - constrained by the observed radio , x - ray , and tev spectra . in the simplest one - zone model , the tev emission is produced through the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the galactic interstellar radiation by the same relativistic electrons producing the radio and x - rays @xcite .",
    "the tev spectrum can be used to infer the high - energy electron distribution .",
    "one then needs to fit both the synchrotron spectral shape and flux level by adjusting the magnetic field alone .",
    "tev observations always see spectral softening with the increase of the photon energy , suggesting a spectral cutoff @xcite .",
    "there are also indications that the synchrotron spectrum cuts off in the hard x - ray band @xcite .",
    "a single power - law model with an exponential cutoff for the electron distribution has difficulties in reproducing the broad tev spectrum .",
    "models with more gradual cutoffs lead to much better fits .",
    "relativistic particle distributions with gradual high - energy cutoffs are a natural consequence of the stochastic acceleration ( sa ) by plasma waves in magnetized turbulence @xcite .",
    "the particle distribution is determined by the interplay among the acceleration , cooling , and escape processes with the cutoff shape determined by the energy dependence of the ratio of the acceleration to cooling or escape rate . given the low magnetic fields derived from leptonic models , the radiative cooling time is much longer than the remnant lifetime .",
    "the gradual high - energy cutoff has to be caused by the balance between the acceleration and escape processes .",
    "we consider the evolution of weakly magnetized turbulence in the downstream of strong non - relativistic shocks and study the sa by fast mode waves .",
    "the large scale turbulence cascades following the kolmogorov phenomenology @xcite until it reaches the scale , where the eddy turnover time becomes comparable to the period of fast mode waves .",
    "the iroshnikov - kraichnan phenomenology prevails on even smaller scales .",
    "the collisionless damping of plasma waves sets in at the coherent length of the magnetic field , where the eddy turnover time is comparable to the period of alfvn waves .",
    "fast mode waves propagating nearly parallel to the mean magnetic field can survive the transit - time damping ( ttd ) by the thermal background particles , and accelerate some electrons through cyclotron resonances to a power - law high - energy distribution , which cuts off at the energy , where the particle gyro - radius reaches the coherent length of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "acceleration of higher energy electrons by the nearly isotropic fast mode waves on larger scales leads to a gradual cutoff .",
    "sa of electrons can naturally account for emissions from the stsnrs with a weak magnetic field .",
    "future observations in the hard x - ray and mev bands may test the model . the particle acceleration model is described in   [ model ] and applied to snrs rx j1713 - 3946 and j0852.0 - 4622 to derive quantitative results in   [ app ] .",
    " [ con ] gives the conclusions .",
    "the collisionless nature of weakly magnetized shocks implies difficulties in converting the free energy in the system into heat and energetic particles instantaneously at a narrow sf .",
    "instead , the high magnetic reynolds number implies strong turbulence .",
    "previous studies of diffusive shocks focus on its roles in making high - energy particles crossing the sf repeatedly .",
    "the turbulence can also carry a significant fraction of the released free energy and decay gradually .",
    "the turbulence generation mechanism is not well understood .",
    "it is usually attributed to the weibel instability @xcite of particle streaming and may also depend on the properties of the upstream plasma .",
    "we here assume that the turbulence is isotropic and generated at a scale @xmath2 with an eddy speed @xmath3 . the free energy dissipation rate is then given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is dimensionless .",
    "for strong non - relativistic shocks with the shock frame upstream speed @xmath6 much higher than the speed of the upstream fast mode waves @xmath7 , mass , momentum , and energy conservations across the sf require @xmath8 where the alfvn speed @xmath9 , the isothermal sound speed @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the magnetic field , mass density , pressure , respectively .",
    "the shock structure can be complicated due to the presence of strong turbulence , and the speeds @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath3 should be considered as averaged quantities over @xmath16 , which also corresponds to the energy dissipation scale .",
    "the excitation of plasma waves should be very efficient in the supersonic phase with @xmath17 , and the waves may prevail in the downstream accelerating some particles in the background plasma to very high energies .",
    "the eddy turnover speed and time are given respectively by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the isotropic turbulence power spectrum , wave number , and eddy size , respectively .",
    "at the turbulence generation scale @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the total turbulence energy is given by @xmath25 .",
    "the mhd wave period is given by @xmath26 .",
    "then the transition scale from the kolmogorov to kraichnan phenomenology @xmath27 occurs at @xmath28 , which gives @xmath29 for @xmath30 , the turbulence spectrum in the inertial range is given by @xmath31 the collisionless damping starts at the coherent length of the magnetic field @xmath32 , where the period of alfvn waves @xmath33 is comparable to the eddy turnover time , @xmath34    both @xmath15 and @xmath14 may be lower than @xmath3 near the sf . if @xmath35 at the sf , fast , slow , and alfvn waves can all be excited , and the consequent plasma heating quickly leads to @xmath36 .",
    "fast mode waves with the highest phase speed should dominate the sa processes .",
    "we assume that they dominate the energy dissipation as the turbulent flow moves away from the sf and @xmath37 evolves from @xmath15 to @xmath3 at the same time . for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma with isotropic particle distributions , which are reasonable in the absence of strong large scale magnetic fields ,",

    "the first and second terms in the brackets on the right hand side correspond to damping by electrons and protons , respectively . for weakly magnetized plasma with @xmath46 , proton heating always dominates the ttd for @xmath47 ( quataert 1998 ) . if @xmath15 does not change dramatically in the downstream , the continuous heating of background particles through the ttd processes makes @xmath48 since the heating rates are proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the mass and temperature of the particles , respectively .",
    "parallel propagating waves with @xmath52 are not subject to the ttd . obliquely propagating waves are damped efficiently by the background particles .",
    "although the damping rates for waves propagating nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field with @xmath53 are also low , these waves are subject to damping by magnetic field wandering @xcite .",
    "the turbulence power spectrum cuts off sharply when the damping rate becomes comparable to the turbulence cascade rate @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "one can define a critical propagation angle @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "then for @xmath57 with @xmath58 for @xmath59 , equations ( [ ik ] ) and ( [ d1 ] ) give @xmath60 where the electron pressure and damping have been ignored .",
    "for @xmath61 , we have @xmath62u^2 $ ] .",
    "the acceleration and scattering times of relativistic electrons by these nearly parallel propagating waves are energy independent and given , respectively , by @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite , where @xmath65 is the speed of light . the electron escape time from the large scale eddies",
    "is given by @xmath66 , and the spectral index of the accelerated electrons in the steady state is given by @xmath67 the maximum energy that electrons can reach is given by @xmath68/12\\}^{1/2}(v_f / c ) = 7.26[(p+0.5)^2 - 2.25]^{1/2 } [ c_{2p}/(c_{2p}+1)]^{1/2}$ ] @xmath69 tev , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the elementary charge units .",
    "the ratio of the dissipated energy carried by non - thermal particles to that of the thermal particles should be greater than @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , since the isotropic turbulence with @xmath74 can also accelerate particles with the lorentz factor @xmath75 .",
    "electrons with even higher energy interact with the nearly isotropic fast mode waves at @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding acceleration and escape times are proportional to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , which leads to a steady - state electron distribution @xmath78 for @xmath79 @xcite . to obtain the complete electron distribution from the thermal energy to the high - energy cutoff self - consistently",
    ", one needs to obtain the acceleration and scattering rates by these nearly parallel propagating ( with @xmath80 ) and nearly isotropic ( with @xmath74 ) fast mode waves and solve the particle kinetic equation numerically .",
    "these are beyond the scope of this paper . instead",
    ", the above discussions indicate that the particle distribution may be approximated reasonably well by @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "to have significant particle acceleration , the acceleration time needs to be shorter than the turbulence decay time : @xmath83 , which also validates the usage of the steady - state solution of the particle kinetic equation and implies @xmath84^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "several stsnrs have been observed extensively in the radio , x - ray , and tev bands .",
    "x - ray observations with _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ , and tev observations with hess have made several surprising discoveries that challenge the classical diffusive shock particle acceleration model .",
    "the snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 is about @xmath85 years old @xcite with a radius of @xmath86 pc and a distance of @xmath87 kpc . by fitting its broadband spectrum with the above electron distribution and background photon field given by @xcite through the synchrotron and ic processes , we find that @xmath88 , @xmath89 g , @xmath90 tev , and the total energy of electrons with @xmath91 @xcite , @xmath92 erg ( fig . [ fit ] ) .",
    "the thin line shows the best fit with @xmath93 , whose tev spectrum is not broad enough to explain the hess observations . in the hard x - ray band ,",
    "our model predicted emission spectrum is significantly harder and brighter , which gives better fit to the _ suzaku _ observations and can be tested with future _ hxmt _ and _ nustar _ observations .",
    "our model also predicts a higher mev flux testable with future _ glast _ observations .",
    "figure [ dep ] shows the dependence of the spectrum on @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the distribution of relativistic electrons obtained above implies @xmath96^{-1/2}u_0^{-1}$ ] cm , and the electron density @xmath97^{1/4}(c_1u)^{3/2}v_f$ ] @xmath98 @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the helium abundance . for the steady - state solution to be applicable , @xmath101 . for @xmath102",
    ", we have @xmath103 cm , @xmath104 @xmath99 , @xmath105^{1/2}l/2 v_f = 138 u_0^{-2}$ ] yrs , @xmath106 = 42.3 u_0^{-2}$ ] yrs , and @xmath107 . the energy carried by the magnetic field @xmath108 erg .",
    "the short coherent length of the magnetic field @xmath109 cm is consistent with the low level of polarization from most part of the radio image @xcite .",
    "if @xmath110 does nt change significantly in the downstream , the distance that relativistic electrons diffuse through the @xmath111 yr lifetime of the remnant is about @xmath112 pc .",
    "most of them are therefore trapped near the sf . the total kinetic energy carried by the supersonic dissipative layer in the lab frame",
    "is @xmath113 erg . the corresponding gas mass @xmath114 g , thermal energy @xmath115 erg , gas temperature @xmath116 kev , where we have assumed that the temperatures of protons and helium ions are the same and @xmath117 .",
    "the acceleration efficiency of @xmath118 is not sensitive to @xmath94 and @xmath6 and therefore does nt change significantly through the evolution of the snr , implying that a thermal energy of @xmath119 erg , which is @xmath120 times higher than @xmath121 , be produced in accompany with the electron acceleration .",
    "the mass of the shocked thermal plasma is about @xmath122 g@xmath123 .",
    "these suggest that most of the relativistic electrons were accelerated more than @xmath124 years before outside the current dissipative layer . if the shocked plasma is uniformly distributed within a shell of 4.5 pc ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , the electron density is @xmath125 @xmath99 , which is comparable to that inferred from x - ray observations ( cassam - chena et al .",
    ". however , x - ray observations of the north - west outer edge of the remnant suggests @xmath126 ( uchiyama et al .",
    "so the model predicted thermal x - ray emission likely exceeds the observed value . the north - west edge is interacting with dense molecular clouds .",
    "it is possible that the shock speed in a low density medium is still greater than the observed upper limit so that @xmath127 . on the other hand ,",
    "given the uncertainties in the collisionless electron heating processes , the electron temperature may be well below @xmath128 kev so that no significant thermal x - ray emission is expected in the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ x - ray bands .",
    "coulomb collisions will make @xmath129 kev @xcite .",
    "line emission dominates the cooling with a luminosity of @xmath130 erg s@xmath131 and may be observed in the uv to soft x - ray band .",
    "detailed modeling of the evolution of the snr is needed to reach more quantitative results @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations discover thin bright features varying on a timescale of about a year .",
    "the width of these features is about @xmath132 cm , corresponding to a speed @xmath133 .",
    "since the shock speed is much less than this value , the variability has been attributed to cooling in very strong magnetic fields @xcite . according to our model",
    ", the decay may be due to the diffusive escape of relativistic electrons from bright regions .",
    "for electrons with a scattering mean free path of @xmath134 , the corresponding diffusive escape time from a region of size @xmath135 is about 0.93 years .",
    "the x - rays are produced by electrons with energies greater than @xmath136 , whose scattering mean free path by fast mode waves should be longer than @xmath134 implying a diffusion timescale of a few months . the formation of these bright features is then related to the inhomogeneity in the pre - shock medium , which is supported by the relatively higher level of radio polarization nearby @xcite .",
    "the fact that the brightening features are not located at the outer edge of the remnant can be attributed to the projection effect .",
    "we also apply the model to snr rx j0852.0 - 4622 . for @xmath137 kpc , @xmath138 pc",
    ", we have @xmath139 g , @xmath140 , @xmath141 tev ( @xmath142 ) , and the electron energy @xmath143 erg .",

    "these two remnants are very similar .",
    "the steady - state distribution of relativistic electrons accelerated by fast mode waves in a downstream turbulent dissipative layer with a thickness @xmath2 of weakly magnetized collisionless astrophysical shocks can be approximated as @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156^{1/2}u/24c$ ] for @xmath157 , and the ratio of the dissipated energies going into nonthermal and thermal particles is @xmath158 for @xmath159 , the turbulence decay time is shorter than the particle acceleration time and one needs to consider the time dependent solution .",
    "the accelerated electrons in the stsnrs give excellent fits to the broadband spectra of snrs rx j1713.7 - 3946 and j0852.0 - 4622 .",
    "the model attributes the recently observed variable x - ray features to inhomogeneity in the upstream and the spatial diffusion of relativistic electrons near the cutoff energy and predicts harder hard x - ray spectrum , higher hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes than leptonic models with a sharper cutoff in the electron distribution .",
    "future high sensitivity hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray observations will test the model .",
    "the major uncertainty of the model is related to the turbulence generation mechanism near the collisionless sf . in this paper , we assume that the turbulence is isotropic and has a characteristic eddy size of @xmath2 .",
    "little is known about the evolution of anisotropic turbulence .",
    "the latter is valid as far as the free energy dissipation through shocks proceeds over the scale @xmath2 , instead of , instantaneously at a narrow region ( @xmath160 ) near the sf as suggested in the diffusive shock models .",
