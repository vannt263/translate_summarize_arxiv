    "although the notion of spherical symmetry is an ideal one , it is known that many systems such as globular clusters , galactic bulges and dark matter haloes can be modelled as being roughly spherically symmetric . in order to model the distribution of matter in such systems in a self - consistent manner ,",
    "one solves the vlasov  poisson system , and the equilibrium solutions are known to be functions of the integrals of motion via jeans s theorem .",
    "the usual method in the literature involves the ` @xmath3 to @xmath4 ' approach . here",
    ", one starts off with a given potential ",
    "density pair and certain assumptions about the velocity structure , and proceeds to find the distribution function @xcite via an appropriate integral transform .",
    "a less common method is the ` @xmath4 to @xmath3 ' approach which postulates a certain functional form for the distribution function , and solving the poisson equation . in general , solving this non - linear differential equation for analytical solutions is very difficult .",
    "the self - consistent approach continues to be widely used , especially in the context of dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium distribution functions in a spherically symmetric setting depend on the two integrals of motion , namely the magnitude of the angular momentum @xmath5 and the energy @xmath6 .",
    "methods for generating two - integral distribution functions have been widely studied in the literature @xcite and originated with @xcite , who noticed that whenever the density profile could be written as a sum of monomials of @xmath7 ( in cylindrical coordinates ) and @xmath8 in the axisymmetric setting , it was possible to construct a distribution function expressible as a sum of monomials in angular momentum and energy .",
    "this procedure was generalized by different authors to spherical and axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "relativistic treatments along the same lines have also been undertaken by several authors , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the approach that we make use of in this paper is akin to the ones mentioned above .",
    "however , it must be mentioned that the powers of the energy and angular momentum thus obtained in spherical symmetry differ from those obtained in an axisymmetric setting . moreover",
    ", the decomposition into powers of @xmath0 and @xmath8 in the spherical case is non - unique , as opposed to the axisymmetric one . owing to this non - uniqueness",
    ", one can construct a wide range of dynamic properties such as the velocity dispersions and anisotropy parameters .",
    "in addition , finding such a decomposition for an arbitrary potential  density pair is rather difficult , with no well - defined algorithm .",
    "the method of double - power distribution functions was employed by @xcite , who used it to generate two - term double - power distribution functions , and it was shown that a wide class of potential  density pairs could thereby be obtained . the double - power approach introduced in this paper is an example of a hybrid approach since it starts off with a known functional form of the distribution function , which is a sum of anisotropic polytropes , but also assumes a priori knowledge of the potential  density pair .",
    "once the augmented density has been found , one could also obtain the distribution function through a different approach which would involve performing a fractional derivative inversion @xcite .",
    "the two approaches are equivalent and the method that we use in this paper is exactly the same as the use of fractional derivatives .    the standard method of constructing distribution functions from a given density profile @xmath9 is via integral transforms .",
    "the simplest such transform is given by eddington s formula , which is used for constructing isotropic distribution functions : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the negative of the newtonian potential , @xmath12 is the binding energy and @xmath13 is found by substituting @xmath14 into @xmath15 . even in this case , the integral is often non - trivial . as a result ,",
    "the distribution functions and their properties such as the velocity dispersions and anisotropy parameters can not be easily reduced to analytical expressions .",
    "the situation is worsened for the case of anisotropic distribution functions , which depend on both energy and angular momentum . in this case , the fundamental integral relation yields a function @xmath16 ( for the isotropic case , it is only a function of @xmath17 ) which we will refer to as the augmented density , and an analogue of eddington s formula exists but is substantially more complicated @xcite .",
    "first , we perform a double - integral transform to construct a function @xmath18 : @xmath19.\\ ] ] then , we analytically continue the second argument to the complex domain , and the distribution function is found by taking the imaginary part of the result : @xmath20.\\ ] ] in addition , a further disadvantage of this approach stems from the fact that the above inversion scheme , as pointed out by @xcite is numerically unstable .",
    "@xcite derived an elegant family of models , which possessed hyperviriality , i.e. they satisfied the virial theorem locally .",
    "this aspect has important ( positive ) consequences for stability , as the authors point out , because it constrains the number of high - velocity stars that can escape and give rise to instability .",
    "the importance of the local virial theorem , i.e. hyperviriality , in self - gravitating systems has also been studied by other authors @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite went on to derive a two - component family of hypervirial distribution functions , which were presented as candidates for modelling dark matter haloes .",
    "the family of models that are described by the two different hypervirial families include a wide range of commonly used models such as the plummer ( eddington in 1916 discovered the hypervirial nature of its distribution function ) and hernquist models , but there are several other commonly used potential ",
    "density pairs which do not have a known hypervirial distribution function such as the hnon isochrone , jaffe , dehnen and nfw models .",
    "@xcite derived a very general theorem relating two global properties , the cusp slope @xmath21 and the central anisotropy @xmath22 through the relation @xmath23 .",
    "other work that connects the cusp slope to global quantities includes @xcite , which relates it to the tsallis entropic index .",
    "@xcite proved that this holds true for distribution functions with constant anisotropy , and generalized this to systems with non - constant anisotropy via the series expansion .",
    "this theorem was generalized by @xcite , who studied the global equivalent , termed the global density - slope anisotropy inequality ( gdsai ) , for separable augmented densities , and established the conditions under which it held true .",
    "we emphasize that some of the augmented densities constructed through the double - power approach in this paper are not separable , although they can be expressed as a sum of separable augmented densities .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ secti ]",
    ", we introduce the double - power approach , which involves constructing an augmented density that is expressible as a sum of monomials in @xmath17 and @xmath0 . by using this augmented density",
    ", we construct the corresponding distribution functions and associated properties , such as velocity dispersions , and perform an asymptotic analysis to deduce some of its general features .",
    "this procedure is explicitly carried out for the @xmath24 veltmann model , and some of the simpler distribution functions are calculated .",
    "this procedure is also extended to the plummer and hernquist models in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "the second part of the paper is concerned with investigating the behaviour of hypervirial distribution functions which satisfy the virial theorem locally . in section [ sectii ]",
    ", we present a generic method of constructing augmented densities that are hypervirial for a wide range of physical models from a basic ansatz .",
    "we make use of this procedure to find the corresponding hypervirial augmented densities and the distribution functions for well - known models such as the hnon isochrone , nfw , jaffe and dehnen models . in section [ sectiii ] ,",
    "we take the generic hypervirial augmented density and derive universal properties , which include an algebraic relation between the density slope and the anisotropy parameter in the inner regime .",
    "in this section , we develop the formalism and illustrate it by deriving various families of distribution functions for the degenerate veltmann isochrone models @xcite . even though most distribution functions discussed in this section are found in the literature , a few",
    "have never been explicitly written down to the authors knowledge .",
    "the degenerate veltmann isochrone models comprise of the following one - parameter family of potential ",
    "density pairs : @xmath25 @xmath26^{-(1/m)-2},\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath27 is positive .",
    "these models constitute the limiting case of the more general family described by veltmann , and we shall henceforth abbreviate them as the veltmann models .",
    "two of the best known spherical models of astrophysics are included in the family : the plummer model ( for @xmath28 ) and the hernquist model ( for @xmath29 ) , and the case @xmath30 is a good approximation to the nfw profile commonly used to model dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "we will find it convenient to define @xmath11 and @xmath31 .    a distribution function of the anisotropic polytropic form for this potential  density pair was derived in @xcite and @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an unimportant normalization factor , and it is implicitly understood that the distribution function vanishes whenever @xmath34 . as discussed in @xcite , this distribution function possesses the remarkable property that the virial theorem holds locally ( i.e. hyperviriality ) . in this section ,",
    "we proceed to find distribution functions of the more general form : @xmath35 where we restrict @xmath36 to be positive constants , so that the distribution function is manifestly nonnegative .",
    "we will variously refer to a distribution function of the above form as a multi component ( anisotropic ) polytrope , or , following @xcite , as a double - power distribution function .",
    "obviously , the distribution function ( [ hypervirialdf ] ) is a special case consisting of one component .",
    "the distribution function ( [ doublepowerdf ] ) gives rise to the poisson equation : @xmath37 through the evaluation of integrals of the form @xmath38 @xmath39 where the first integral above converges for @xmath40 and the second converges for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it follows that the density is finite provided @xmath43 and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "our task now will be to come up with some augmented density @xmath46 for the veltmann potential ",
    "density pair , expand the augmented density as a series in @xmath0 and @xmath17 to recast it in the form of equation ( [ mastereq ] ) , and deduce the powers and coefficients appearing in equation ( [ doublepowerdf ] ) .",
    "it is well known that solving for the distribution function for a given potential ",
    "density pair is a degenerate problem , and there are infinitely many ways to come up with an augmented density .",
    "once an augmented density is known , it is also possible to calculate the velocity dispersions without having to resort to finding the explicit form of the distribution function .",
    "such a procedure is discussed in @xcite , and the corresponding expressions are given by @xmath47 @xmath48 d\\psi',\\ ] ] and it must be noted that @xmath49 .",
    "this emerges from the fact that , when the expectation values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are computed , they result in integrals of the form @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which are exactly equal to each other .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are all zero as well , which arises from the fact that @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the relations @xmath58 hold true for @xmath59 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath60 is @xmath61      in this subsection , we will introduce an augmented density ansatz that comprises of a finite number of components .",
    "we perform an asymptotic analysis to obtain the limiting values of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "in addition , we shall explicitly set down some expressions for the distribution functions and velocity structure profiles for the nfw - like profile ( @xmath24 ) discussed by @xcite .",
    "we first focus on the case where the augmented density consists of a finite number of components . from equation ( [ phiveltmann ] )",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "this immediately leads to the one - component augmented density which corresponds to the distribution function ( [ hypervirialdf ] ) @xmath64 next , we multiply and divide the right - hand side of equation ( [ rho1term ] ) with @xmath65^q$ ] for any natural number @xmath66 , and cast the augmented density as @xmath67^{q}.\\ ] ] since @xmath66 is a natural number , we may use the binomial theorem to obtain the finite sum @xmath68 it is worth noting that @xmath66 need not necessarily be an integer . since this section is concerned with a distribution function that has a finite number of double - power components , an integral value of @xmath66 was chosen to satisfy this criterion . each of the @xmath69 factors in equation ( [ rhoqbinom ] ) can be multiplied and divided themselves by some positive integral power of @xmath70 as undertaken earlier . in general , one can choose different powers for different terms .",
    "let us say that the kth term is multiplied and divided with @xmath65^{n_{k}}$ ] for some positive integer @xmath71 .",
    "we then have @xmath72^{n_{k}}.\\ ] ] by using the binomial theorem again , the augmented density becomes @xmath73 we will perform an asymptotic analysis of the above augmented density ansatz to obtain the limiting values of the anisotropy parameter , which is important in investigating the gdsai .",
    "most of the work involving the gdsai @xcite was undertaken for separable distribution functions , but it must be noted that this ansatz is not separable .",
    "one can use equations ( [ sigmar2])([betafromv ] ) to compute the velocity dispersion profiles and the anisotropy parameter for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting function is a function of @xmath0 and @xmath17 , of which the latter itself is a function of @xmath0 .",
    "now , in the limit @xmath74 it is worth noting that only the lowest powers of @xmath0 dominate the other terms . in this limit , @xmath75 , which is a constant , which simplifies matters a great deal . by considering the _ smallest _ powers of @xmath0 in the numerator and the denominator of the velocity structure profiles",
    ", it is found that @xmath76",
    "@xmath77 @xmath78 the remarkable property of the above expression is that the anisotropy parameter is completely independent of the choice of the @xmath71 and @xmath66 under the limit @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , for any distribution function of the form @xmath80 , it is relatively straightforward to argue that as @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that the total number of terms in our distribution function is irrelevant when it comes to determining the central value of the anisotropy parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the leading power for the density profile at small @xmath0 is @xmath83 ; thus , for @xmath84 , we have an inner cusp @xmath85 . from this",
    ", we can conclude that the cusp slope - central anisotropy inequality is saturated , and one has @xmath86 .",
    "we can perform a similar asymptotic analysis in the limit @xmath87 .",
    "however , in this limit , one must note that @xmath17 falls off as @xmath88 .",
    "thus , one must be more careful in evaluating the anisotropy parameter in this region because @xmath17 also has an @xmath0-dependence .",
    "as we are interested in @xmath87 , we must take into consideration the highest powers of @xmath0 ( inclusive of the contribution from @xmath17 ) in the denominator and the numerator of the velocity structure profiles , since they dominate the expression in this limit .",
    "the velocity structure profiles take on the form @xmath89",
    "@xmath90 @xmath91 this is again a fairly simple expression that is independent of most of the free parameters inherent in the ansatz . as before , for a distribution function of the form @xmath92 , it is straightforward to argue that as @xmath87 , one has @xmath93 .",
    "the above expression can also be rewritten as @xmath94 since we know that @xmath66 and @xmath95 are both positive , it immediately follows that @xmath96 for all values of @xmath27 .",
    "this can also be established in the following manner .",
    "we have earlier stated that @xmath97 and that @xmath98 .",
    "from these two conditions , it is evident that @xmath99 .",
    "the cases of the plummer and hernquist model have been extensively analysed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we will supplement these analyses by studying in some detail the distribution functions for the nfw - like profile ( @xmath24 ) discussed by @xcite .    for @xmath100 ,",

    "@xmath160 then , through the taylor series for @xmath161 , we can compute the coefficients @xmath155 and powers @xmath156 for the augmented density , and use the double - power recipe to compute the distribution function in series form ( the recipe only works if all @xmath156 are positive , or equivalently , if all powers in the taylor series for @xmath161 are larger than 1 ) . at this point , we point out a caveat : in general the function @xmath161 can not be defined at all radii .",

    "+ to illustrate the fact that the result above does not approximate the outer region well , note that while the plummer model and the isochrone model have the same inner cusp ( @xmath186 ) , the outer falloff of the isochrone model ( @xmath187 ) is less steep than that of its hypervirial approximation ( @xmath188 ) . finally , for the isochrone model near the origin",

    "as can be seen from this figure , the convergence in the velocity structure profiles is excellent as long as we remain close to the origin .",

    "the most striking aspect of this relation is that they are completely independent of the choice of the @xmath279 and the @xmath280 and the number of terms @xmath281 in the hypervirial augmented density ansatz , which proves their generality .",
    "furthermore , one discovers a second remarkable result by considering equation ( [ betahypervirialallmodels ] ) .",

    ", it can be shown that @xmath282 .",
    "this might lead us to conclude that @xmath283 , but this is _ not _ the case .",
    "the reason is simple , and stems from the non - monotonic nature of @xmath164 which was used to construct the augmented density . because of this property , one ends up with two different branches , and consequently , the augmented density in the region @xmath81 is not the same as the augmented density in the region @xmath81 .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath284 for these models is also not identical which in turn implies that @xmath285 in general .",

    "these models also happen to be the one - term hypervirial models discussed in the previous sections , where the two branches coincide .",
    "another set of models for whom this equality is preserved are the two - term hypervirial models studied by @xcite where the augmented density is applicable for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "this paper presents a hybrid approach that combines the knowledge of the potential  density pair with a distribution function comprising of double - power terms .",
    "a major advantage of this approach is that one can bypass integral transforms , except for equation ( [ centralintegral ] ) , and one can instead sum the series to obtain closed form expressions",
    ". it must be emphasized , however , that not all potential  density pairs lend themselves to such an approach , but a large number of the physically relevant models are amenable to such a treatment .",
    "it is also important that the free parameters be chosen such that they ensure that the distribution functions thus generated satisfy the phase - space consistency requirements @xcite .",
    "the second advantage of this approach lies in the fact that it presents a means of generating a reasonably diverse range of distribution functions for several models .",
    "the double - power distribution functions are themselves generated from a double - power augmented density ansatz , which has additional advantages of its own .",
    "in particular , one can construct an appropriate double - power augmented density ansatz that is always hypervirial , irrespective of the choice of the potential  density pair , and use it to generate the potential ",
    "density pairs of known models to arbitrary accuracy .    in section [ secti ] ,",
    "we illustrate the method of constructing a more complex augmented density from a basic one by performing simple algebraic operations on the simpler augmented density .",
    "the usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to a concrete example , namely the @xmath24 veltmann model .",
    "this model is of relevance because of its similarities to the nfw profile , and for the reason that the basic augmented density is hypervirial . in this section ,",
    "we explicitly compute some of the simpler distribution functions and their velocity dispersions for this model . in an associated appendix ( appendix [ appa ] )",
    ", we also list some of the corresponding expressions for the plummer and hernquist models , which can also be generated using alternative methodologies currently existing in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the primary aim of the paper is to generate hypervirial distribution functions for a wide array of models . in order to do so , we start with an appropriate double - power augmented density ansatz in section [ sectii ] that satisfies the hypervirial property for any given potential  density pair .",
    "the next step involves expanding the potential ",
    "density pair as a power series , and matching coefficients with the expression for the augmented density . by doing so",
    ", we present a method that gives rise to hypervirial distribution functions that can model a given potential  density pair to an arbitrarily high degree of accuracy .",
    "the non - monotonicity of @xmath157 requires two different distribution functions in the two regimes @xmath79 and @xmath287 .",
    "this method is employed to construct hypervirial distribution functions for commonly used potential ",
    "density pairs in the literature including the hnon isochrone , nfw , jaffe and dehnen models . after we construct the distribution functions",
    ", we also compute the velocity dispersions and the anisotropy parameter , as well as the relative error @xmath167 which measures the deviation of the augmented density from the actual density .    in section [ sectiii ] , we take the generic hypervirial augmented density that was used to generate the distribution functions for the above models , and investigate its behaviour as @xmath79 and @xmath287 .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a universal relation between the anisotropy parameter and the density slope in the asymptotic regime @xmath81 . in other words , we show that all the hypervirial distribution functions thus constructed ( from the hypervirial augmented density ansatz ) saturate the cusp slope  central anisotropy theorem derived by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the asymptotic values of the anisotropy parameter , @xmath277 and @xmath288 , are equal for all models that possess a finite total mass and can be described by a single augmented density in all regions . for such models ,",
    "we show that the asymptotic values of the anisotropy parameter are functionally very simple .    owing to the existence of these universal properties for the hypervirial augmented densities",
    ", it seems reasonable to suppose that observations which establish any of the above properties may be strongly indicative of an underlying hypervirial distribution function .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that any potential observational evidence that satisfies any of the above properties will @xmath289 necessarily indicate hyperviriality because these properties hold true for the hypervirial ansatz but the converse is not necessarily valid .",
