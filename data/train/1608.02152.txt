    "the goal of the present paper is to determine explicit solutions in two dimensional cones of homogeneous dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the extremal elliptic equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the pucci s extremal operators introduced by c. pucci in @xcite .",
    "we recall that , given two ellipticity constants @xmath3 , the operator @xmath1 , as a function of @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the set of @xmath6 symmetric matrices , can be equivalently defined either as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the eigenvalues of @xmath9 , or as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the identity matrix in @xmath5 and @xmath13 is the usual partial ordering in @xmath5 , meaning that @xmath14 if and only if @xmath15 has nonpositive eigenvalues .    the operator @xmath2 is likewise defined either as @xmath16 or as @xmath17 and it is easy to verify that @xmath18 the pucci operators @xmath19 are extremal not only in the class of linear elliptic operators , but they satisfy @xmath20 for any uniformly elliptic opearator @xmath21 having ellipticity constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 and satisfying @xmath24 .",
    "this explains the central role played by @xmath19 in the elliptic theory , see the monograph @xcite , and the importance of finding explicit solutions of ( [ general ] ) which act as barrier functions in comparison theorems for solutions of more general fully nonlinear equations .    in particular , solutions of ( [ general ] ) in cone  like domains may be used in the asymptotic analysis near corners of solutions in lipschitz domains of general elliptic equations with asymptotically negligible lower order terms , as performed for divergence form operators , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ general ] ) are known to have homogeneous solutions in cone  like domains of @xmath25 for any dimension @xmath26 , see @xcite . in particular , the more recent results of @xcite establish that , for any positively homogeneous and uniformly elliptic operator @xmath21 and any cone @xmath27 , the homogeneous dirichlet problem @xmath28 has exactly four ( up to normalization ) constant sign homogeneous solutions , that are of the form @xmath29    v_{\\beta^{\\pm}}(x)= |x|^{\\beta^\\pm } \\psi_{\\beta^\\pm}\\left ( \\frac{x}{|x|}\\right ) & \\hbox{with } \\beta^-<0<\\beta^+,\\ \\psi_{\\beta^\\pm}<0    \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath30 are the only constant sign solutions of ( [ pf ] ) which are bounded either for @xmath31 or as @xmath32 .",
    "the homogeneity exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined in @xcite by means of inf or sup formulas which resemble the maximum principle based approach to the theory of the principal eigenvalues , and their evaluation requires the determination of explicit sub or supersolutions of problem ( [ pf ] ) . when the operator @xmath21 is one of the pucci extremal operators and the cone @xmath35 is axially symmetric , a direct approach for finding the homogeneous solutions of ( [ pf ] ) has been proposed in @xcite , where the one variable functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are proved to solve fully nonlinear eigenvalue problems for ode . the existence of the pairs @xmath38 and @xmath39 is obtained by means of well - posedness results for odes , and also in this case no explicit evaluation is provided . in the two dimensional case @xmath40 , the autonomous second order ode problems for @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "have been reduced in @xcite to first order systems , which have been integrated by introducing polar coohrdinates in the phase plane .",
    "this method leads to implicit expressions both for the homogeneity exponents and for the angular functions .",
    "in this paper we consider as in @xcite the two dimensional problem for the pucci operators , and we integrate directly the fully nonlinear ode obtained for the angular functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to an explicit formula relating the homogeneity exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 with the angle measuring the amplitude of the cone and the ellipticity constants of the operators , see theorem [ homs ] .    several consequences may be deduced from the explicit expression of the homogeneity exponents . as an example , it turns out that for the operator @xmath1 positive homogeneous order two solutions occur only in cones of amplitude @xmath43 , as well as negative homogeneous order two solutions occur only in cones of amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that , when looking for principal eigenfunctions of @xmath1 as functions of separable variables in planar domains analogous to rectangles for laplace operators , one has to consider lipschitz domains with corners of amplitude @xmath43 .",
    "this explicit construction has been performed in @xcite .",
    "similarly , if a `` second '' eigenfunction for the operator @xmath1 in the unit disk does exist , as discussed in @xcite , it must have a nodal line intersecting the boundary of the unit disk with a corner of amplitude @xmath43 .",
    "the homogeneous solutions of equations ( [ general ] ) in cone  like domains allow to prove extended comparison theorems of phragmen  lindelf type , hlder regularity results and removable boundary singularity results for fully nonlinear elliptic equations , as proved in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the homogeneity exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 are intimately related to the critical exponents which separate the zones of existence from those of non existence for the exponent @xmath45 of the problems @xmath46 as discussed in @xcite , if we consider for instance the operator @xmath2 in the above differential inequality , then no positive solution @xmath47 exists provided that @xmath48 by using the explicit expressions of the functions @xmath36 , we can actually prove , at least in the case of two dimensional cones , that the above restrictions on @xmath49 are sharp , by exhibiting explicit solutions in the cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 , see theorem [ liou ] .    as further possible applications of homogeneous solutions , let us finally mention that they have been used for fully nonlinear equations also as counterexamples in regularity theory @xcite , or as barriers for studying overdetermined problems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we construct the homogeneous solutions and derive several relationships between the homogeneity exponents ; in section 3 , after showing some simple monotonicity formulas for all positive supersolutions of uniformly elliptic equations , we prove the optimality of conditions ( [ palfa ] )",
    "this section is devoted to determine explicitly the homogeneous solutions of equations ( [ general ] ) in planar cones .",
    "because of identity ( [ mpm ] ) , it is enough to consider the operator @xmath2 and to construct its positive and negative homogeneous solutions .",

    "we will make use of the explicit computation of the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix for symmetric homogeneous functions which hold true in any dimension @xmath26 .",
    "let us start with the following algebraic result , whose proof is easily verified by straightforward computation .",
