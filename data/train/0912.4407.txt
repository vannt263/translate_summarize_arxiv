    "the cross section displays random fluctuations versus energy or frequency . these are due to the random features of the underlying resonances . with @xmath1 the average resonance spacing and @xmath2 the average width , data on cross - section fluctuations exist for the entire range of the parameter @xmath3 , from the regime of isolated resonances ( @xmath4 ) to that of strongly overlapping resonances ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the analysis of the data focuses on the value of the average cross section and on quantities that characterize the cross - section fluctuations .",
    "these are the variance of the cross section and certain correlation functions . for the analysis",
    ", one needs theoretical expressions for these quantities .",
    "these should be generic and only use a minimum of adjustable parameters .",
    "the generic theoretical treatment of chaotic scattering employs a combination of scattering theory and random - matrix theory  @xcite and uses as input the values of @xmath1 and of the energy - averaged elements @xmath6 of the scattering matrix @xmath0 .",
    "analytical results exist for the @xmath0-matrix autocorrelation and cross - correlation functions  @xcite ( including the value of the average cross section ) and for the third and fourth moments of the @xmath0-matrix  @xcite . because of the complexity of the problem",
    ", analytical results for higher moments of the cross section or for cross - section correlation functions can not be expected in the foreseeable future .",
    "the present paper aims at filling that gap .",
    "we combine the available analytical information  @xcite , results of computer simulations , and of experimental work on microwave billiards  @xcite to study the cross - section autocorrelation function for all values of @xmath3 . in particular , we address the following questions .",
    "( i ) for which values of @xmath3 and with which accuracy can the cross - section autocorrelation function be predicted in terms of the @xmath0-matrix autocorrelation function ?",
    "( ii ) which analytical alternatives exist should that approach fail ?",
    "we consider chaotic scattering in a time - reversal invariant system described by a unitary and symmetric scattering matrix @xmath7 . here",

    "the number @xmath10 of channels may range from unity to a large number , @xmath11 .",
    "chaotic scattering is modeled by writing the @xmath0-matrix in the form  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 the real and symmetric hamiltonian matrix @xmath14 has dimension @xmath15 and describes the dynamics of @xmath16 resonances labeled by greek letters .",
    "these are coupled to the channels by the real matrix elements @xmath17 .",
    "chaos is taken into account by choosing @xmath14 as a member of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices  @xcite .",

    "the overbar denotes the average over the ensemble .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 determines ( or is determined by ) the average level spacing @xmath1 of the @xmath16 resonances .",
    "it is convenient to decompose @xmath20 into an average and a fluctuating part , @xmath21 where the average @xmath0-matrix @xmath6 is assumed to be diagonal .",
    "the values of the diagonal elements @xmath22 serve as input parameters for the statistical model and are assumed to be known .",
    "that is the typical case : in nuclei , @xmath22 is given in terms of the optical model of elastic scattering , in microwave billiards @xmath23 is determined by the running average over a measured spectrum @xcite . in rare cases , the average @xmath0-matrix may not be diagonal . by an orthogonal transformation in channel space ,",
    "@xmath6 can be reduced to diagonal form , see refs .",

    "these coefficients measure the unitarity deficit of the average @xmath0-matrix and give the probability with which the resonances take part in the reaction .",

    "for brevity we refer to @xmath41 as to the cross section . the average cross section @xmath42 is given in terms of @xmath22 and of @xmath43 and is , thus , known .",
