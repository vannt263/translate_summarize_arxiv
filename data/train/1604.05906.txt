    "astrophysical discs composed of ionized gases accrete toward a central object because subject to the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) , which induces transport of angular momentum outwardly .    extended zones of protoplanetary discs are , however , scarcely ionized ( gammie 1996 ) . in these regions",
    "the mri drive is absent and other instabilities of hydrodynamical nature must be active in order to explain the process of planet formation .    among various candidates the strongest are the vertical shear instability ( vsi ) and the subcritical baroclinic instability ( sbi ) .",
    "the vsi is a linear process studied first in differentially rotating stars ( goldreich & schubert 1967 ; fricke 1968 ) and then investigated in discs linearly by urpin ( 2003 ) and nonlinearly by nelson , gressel & umurhan ( 2013 ) .",
    "urpin s analysis investigates quite generally the local stability of a fully stratified and thermally diffusing disc in the presence not only of vertical shear but also of convection ( radial and vertical ) .",
    "its treatment provides a unified axisymmetric dispersion relation for all the aforementioned processes .",
    "the sbi ( klahr & bodenheimer 2003 ; lesur & papaloizou 2010 ) is of non - linear nature and was recently related to a linear growth mechanism ( klahr & hubbard 2014 ; lyra 2014 ) , denominated convective overstability , capable of amplifying small disturbances to finite perturbations , the seeds from which the sbi developes .",
    "convective overstability is a radial convective instability arising in the presence of thermal relaxation ( or thermal diffusion ) when the radial richardson number , @xmath5 , is negative and for vertical wavelengths much shorter than the radial ones . here",
    "we will first discuss the convective overstability in the context of the general theory of urpin ( 2003 ) .",
    "we will show that the dispersion relation of klahr & hubbard ( 2014 ) is the branch of the dispersion relation of urpin ( 2003 ) in the regime @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the vertical and radial wavenumbers respectively ) . as well",
    "the growth rates are essentially the same .",
    "the difference between the thermally diffusing model of urpin ( 2003 ) and the thermally relaxing model of klahr & hubbard ( 2014 ) stays in the fact that in the latter the growth rates are independent of the perturbations wavelengths , whereas in the first one perturbations with intermediate wavelengths grow fastest .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the investigation of the branch of the dispersion relation of urpin ( 2003 ) corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will show that in this sector , even for radial and vertical stratifications with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the disc can become unstable when the ratio @xmath11 is significantly larger or smaller than @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the radial and vertical entropy lenght scales respectively ) .",
    "the origin of this slightly counterintuitive behaviour stays in the hybrid richardson number @xmath15 $ ] .    in order to provide a tangible realization of this instability and to connect these linear results to recent nonlinear simulations we present an equilibrium , with temperature profile function of both radial and vertical coordinates , for which the disc has vertical stratification with @xmath3 and where the destabilization mechanism here described occurs . for such equilibria",
    "we determine the contours in the @xmath16 plane where the instability developes .",
    "the growth rates , which in general vary greatly along the contours , are as well determined at some representative locations both in the case of thermal diffusion and of thermal relaxation .",
    "the configuration considered generalizes the equilibria studied in nelson , gressel and umurhan ( 2013 ) , which were either vertically isothermal ( i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes temperature ) or vertically isentropic ( i.e. @xmath19 ) , to an equilibrium where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "our equilibrium should , however , be viewed more as a proof of concept for the instability mechanism here presented than as an attempt to a detailed description of a protoplanetary disc .",
    "the local stability of a baroclinic disc with full stratification and in the presence of thermal diffusion was studied in full generality by urpin ( 2003 ) .",
    "we reformulate here his analysis along the lines of volponi ( 2014 ) .",

    "we presented as well an equilibrium profile where this condition can be realized .",
    "the instability is very strong in the outer layers or for larger radii with inward transport of angular momentum occurring there , while in internal layers growth is more contained with indefinite sign of @xmath248 .",
    "the overall picture arising is one where an astrophysical disc is potentially teeming with instabilities of different origins .",
    "perturbations with @xmath107 grow due to the vertical shear instability ( urpin 2003 ; nelson , gressel & umurhan 2013 ) or the vertical convective instability ( @xmath140 ) , if present , or a combination of the two ( volponi 2014 ) . on the other side the ones with @xmath111 are subject to growth in zones of the discs where the condition @xmath119 ( urpin 2003 ; klahr & hubbard 2014 ) pertains . for the intermediate regime @xmath112 the disc",

    "one important point concerns the sign of the angular momentum transport associated to linear perturbations .",
    "linear theory predicts outward transport for the vertical shear instability , inward transport for vertical convection and no definite sign for the convective overstability . for the hybrid convective instability here",
    "presented we mentioned above that the sign is either negative or non definite . in the studies of klahr & hubbard ( 2014 ) and lyra ( 2014 )",
    "the convective overstability was identified as the triggering mechanism for the subcritical baroclinic instability . in those studies in the nonlinear regime",
    "the @xmath249 parameter was found to be of order @xmath250 and inducing an outward transport of angular momentum . in this sense",
    "it appears that an inherently nonlinear mechanism is at work in determining the outward direction of the transport , since the sign of @xmath248 is not definite for the convective overstability .",
    "the reynolds stress of linear perturbations , @xmath248 , is usually a good indicator of the direction of the angular momentum transport in the nonlinear regimes .",
    "this happens for the magnetorotational , vertical shear and vertical convective instabilities for which linear and nonlinear reynolds stresses have the same sign , positive for the first two instabilities and negative for the third one .",
    "the ratio @xmath124 plays a central role in the instability mechanism under consideration . in the equilibrium of section 3.1 its scaling for @xmath251",
    "is given with good approximation by @xmath252 at height @xmath253 , @xmath124 increases linearly with @xmath208 , whereas it becomes zero at @xmath254 .",
    "we expect , therefore , @xmath255 at large radii and @xmath256 at the midplane . as well , when @xmath257 we obtain the limits @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "it follows that the midplane is a region where the condition @xmath260 holds .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the three ingredients necessary for the onset of the instability here investigated .",
    "the first is the presence in the disc s domain of surfaces @xmath212 .",
    "the second is a not too small value of the richardson numbers on these surfaces .",
    "finally a ratio @xmath220 significantly away from 1 is required there .",
    "roughly , growth occurs when either @xmath261 or @xmath262 is of order one .",
    "the equilibrium here discussed fullfills the three conditions above specified .",
    "however for a similar equilibrium temperature , i.e. @xmath263^{1/2}$ ] , we noticed that both @xmath261 and @xmath262 are always much smaller than 1 and therefore growth , when present , is weak ( we obtained characteristic growth rates of about @xmath264 for @xmath215 and @xmath222 ) . a sistematic analysis of realistic equilibria which are susceptible to destabilization owing to the hybrid richardson number is a matter which is left open by the present study and which will be worth investigating in the future .",
