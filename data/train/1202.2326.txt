    "quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain computational tasks at an exponentially faster rate than is currently believed to be possible with classical computers @xcite .",
    "one of the main obstacles making the task of building a quantum computer difficult is due to quantum decoherence , where errors can , if not corrected , accumulate and spread rapidly .",
    "the theory of quantum fault - tolerance ( ft ) @xcite provides a means to protect the coherent quantum state and allow a reliable quantum computation .",
    "this can be achieved provided the physical error rate is below a certain threshold value .",
    "the exact value of the threshold error depends on the fault - tolerance scheme adopted for the computation .",
    "all ft schemes have a limited set of operations allowing direct implementation on the encoded quantum information @xcite , and in most known schemes these are the stabilizer operations .",
    "stabilizer operations consist of a family of unitary circuits known as the clifford group , preparation of @xmath0 state and measurement in the computation basis .",
    "although these operations can produce highly entangled states the gottesman - knill theorem @xcite tells us that a computation consisting of the stabilizer operations alone can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer .",
    "the stabilizer state operations are not quantum universal ; in fact , clifford circuit operations alone can not even implement non - linear classical logic gates , such as the toffoli gate .",
    "nevertheless , in most quantum ft schemes the stabilizer operations are those which can be most readily achieved fault tolerantly .",
    "it is natural then to ask , what additional resources are needed to promote the stabilizer operations to universality ?",
    "one answer to this question is given by the theory of magic state distillation ( msd ) @xcite .",
    "almost any single qubit gate is approximately universal for su(2 ) @xcite , and similarly , if the stabilizer operations are augmented by a supply of many copies of almost any ancillary pure state , the states can be used as a resource for the implementation of non - clifford gates via `` state - injection '' methods @xcite .",
    "a supply of qubits in a particular state may suffice , provided it is not a stabilizer state .    to compute fault tolerantly",
    ", we require a scheme that tolerates preparation noise for these ancillary resources .",
    "hence , we are interested in which mixed quantum states provide a suitable resource .",
    "one can straight away identify a set of states which will _ not _ be useful in this regard .",
    "these are the single qubit states that can be prepared via the stabilizer operations , together with classical randomness .",
    "these states are the convex hull of the pauli eigenstates , and we shall call such states the _ stabilizer states_. in the bloch picture they occupy an octahedron , as shown in fig . ( [ magicstates ] ) .",
    "despite these obstacles , bravyi and kitaev  @xcite showed that some mixed non - stabilizer states can enable universal quantum computing .",
    "they proposed a process of  magic state distillation \" whereby suitable resource states are efficiently converted , using only stabilizer operations , into a smaller number of purer non - stabilizer states , the so - called magic states . while their methods are extremely powerful , they only considered the qubit case . for non - generic noise models , it is also possible to distil certain 3-qubit states that can be used to implement the toffoli gate @xcite .",
    "here we tackle the problem of distilling pure 3-dimensional , or qutrit , non - stabilizer states , and herein refer to all pure non - stabilizer states as magic states .",
    "known magic state distillation schemes have an iterative structure @xcite , with each iterate having 3 steps :    1 .   _",
    "initialization _ , prepare @xmath1copies of the qudit resource state @xmath2 ; 2 .",
    "_ projection _ , measure pauli - observables that stabilize a @xmath3-dimensional subspace and postselect on the @xmath4 outcome ; 3 .",
    "_ decoding _ , perform a clifford unitary that maps the @xmath3-dimensional subspace onto a single physical qudit @xmath5 .",
    "when successful , the output state @xmath5 is used as one of the inputs on the next level of iteration .",
    "all known magic state distillation protocols achieve higher purities via iteration , although non - iterative protocols are an interesting possibility ; for example , compare with the hashing protocol  @xcite and quantum polar codes @xcite used in analogous context of entanglement distillation .",
    "if there exists a protocol that iteratively , or by other means , converts a resource state @xmath2 into a magic state of arbitrarily high purity , then @xmath2 is said to be resource state .",
    "magic state distillation for qubits has an elegant geometrical visualisation in terms of the bloch sphere . in this representation ,",
    "the stabilizer states form an octahedron , whose vertices are the pauli eigenstates .",
    "clifford group unitaries coincide with symmetries of this octahedron .",
    "the magic states distilled by the protocol of @xcite correspond to the states invariant under certain rotational symmetries .",
    "the first of these is the set of @xmath6 rotations around the edges of the octahedron , which contains the hadamard gate , and we shall call hadamard - type , or h - type rotations . the second type are @xmath7 rotations around the faces of the octahedron , known as t - type rotations .     ( blue )",
    "_ h_-type magic states and @xmath8 ( red ) _ t_-type magic states .",
    "]        there has been a considerable amount of work to improve the original qubit schemes in @xcite and to modify their noise model .",
    "reichardt @xcite showed how all the states above the edges of the octahedron can be distilled by steane s 7 qubit code .",
    "in contrast , two interesting no - go theorems for qubit and odd - dimensional systems show that not all non - stabilizer states are useful resources .",
    "recently , veitch _ et .",
    "@xcite showed that for odd - dimensional systems there exist bound states that can not contribute any enhancement to the computational power of the stabilizer operations .",
    "the qubit problem is more subtle .",
    "campbell and browne @xcite showed that for any iterative protocol there will always exist undistillable qubit states above the faces of the octahedron .",
    "however , non - iterative qubit protocols are still poorly understood .",
    "furthermore , campbell @xcite introduced an activation protocol that can activate qubit states from above the octahedron face to the distillable regions .",
    "the magic state distillation protocol allows us to upper bound the error tolerance threshold @xcite and is at the heart of state - of - the - art fault tolerance schemes @xcite .",
    "moreover , an experimental implementation of msd has been recently demonstrated in an nmr system for the @xmath9qubit code @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , very little study has been made of whether magic state distillation can be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "there are a number of reasons why such a study would be important",
    ". in particular , topological quantum systems have anyons with braiding statistics and a dimensionality that is fixed by the physical system . research into understanding these systems",
    "is ongoing @xcite , but it is entirely plausible that the most promising systems provide braiding statistics corresponding to clifford operations of dimensions greater than 2 .",
    "furthermore , the original magic state schemes have some surprising features ( hence the name `` magic states '' ) , and it is unclear how much these depend on special features of the qubit clifford group , or whether they are generic .",
    "there are therefore many open questions .",
    "can the region of states which converge under distillation be identified ?",
    "a study of higher dimensional msd may give new insights into the structural differences between the clifford group in two - dimensions , which plays a central role in quantum computation theory , and in higher - dimensions , where it has been intensively studied in the context of sic - povms @xcite , mubs @xcite and dwf ( discrete wigner functions ) @xcite .",
    "recently , expanding on their work in @xcite , van dam and howard @xcite have studied noise thresholds with @xmath3-dimensional quantum systems .",
    "they have calculated the set of robust qudit states that are most resilient to depolarizing noise and found the degree of noise needed to map such states to the set of stabilizer states increases with dimension scaling with @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the higher dimensional states have the potential to offer higher magic state distillation thresholds . until now",
    ", however , no magic state distillation schemes for @xmath11 had been presented .    in this paper , we present the first generalization of magic state distillation to higher dimensional systems .",
    "we demonstrate that magic state distillation can be achieved in a qutrit system , and find both similarities and differences with previously known msd protocols for qubits .",
    "we have chosen to focus on the three - dimensional qutrit space for this first study since it has the benefit of prime dimension , and computational tractability . nevertheless , many of the features which we uncover are likely to be generic .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "[ secdef ] by defining notation and discussing the state space and the clifford group in higher dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ secmsd5 ] we present a generalised approach to study the distillation properties of any stabilizer code of any prime dimension .",
    "the main protocol we consider is a qutrit generalization of the @xmath12-qubit code covered in sec .",
    "[ 5qutritcode ] and app .",
    "[ appdistillation ] . here",
    "we find magic state distillation occurring for 2 distinct families of states .",
    "the first family contains a pair of eigenstates of the qutrit hadamard operator . under depolarizing noise , they are distilled up to an error threshold of @xmath13 .",
    "this family is generic in that all quantum states can be mapped into the hadamard plane by random application of the hadamard unitaries , a process known as hadamard - twirling .",
    "the second family contain four eigenstates of the qutrit hadamard - squared operator , but lies within a degenerate eigenspace of this operator , and so is not uniquely defined by it . under depolarizing noise , they are distilled up to an error threshold of @xmath14 .",
    "not all magic states , such as those output by the 5-qutrit code , are known to be useful for state injected non - clifford gates . however",
    ", certain special magic states , which we call phase - states , do have the capacity to implement non - clifford unitaries .",
    "we show that , by executing additional protocols , the outputs from the 5-qutrit code can be converted into the desirable phase - states .",
    "we overview the whole process in fig .",
    "( [ fig_overview ] ) , which shows that the promotion of the clifford group can be achieved by following 5-qutrit distillation by parity - checking and equatorialization , which we describe in sec .",

    "a quantum dit , or a qudit , is a @xmath15level quantum system where @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding quantum state @xmath17 can be represented by a positive semidefinite @xmath18 matrix of unit trace . in the language of linear algebra ,",
    "such a matrix can be decomposed as a linear sum of a basis set . for our purposes",
    "we have adopted the weyl basis ( also known as the heisenberg - weyl basis ) .",
    "this is because the weyl basis set is a natural generalization of the conventional qubit pauli operators which makes them very convenient in studying msd .",
    "herein we assume that @xmath19 is a prime dimension .      the @xmath15dimensional single - qudit @xmath20 and @xmath21 pauli operators are defined as @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24-th root of unity . from this definition",
    "we see that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are traceless non - hermitian unitaries .",
    "they obey the commutation relation @xmath25 and are cyclic in the power of @xmath19 ( i.e @xmath26 ) .",
    "we define a slightly different form of the single - qudit pauli operators as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 . the main reason for choosing this definition and the significance of the extra phase @xmath29 will become apparent in section [ secquditspace ] .",
    "but we shall first outline some of the properties of the pauli operators based on this definition . for a single qudit",
    ", the composition of two pauli operators can easily be verified to be @xmath30 for the case of a composite system of @xmath1qudits we use the symplectic notation to represents the @xmath1fold tensor products of pauli operators @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are vectors in @xmath34 .",

    "we must therefore impose the hermiticity condition @xmath62 .",

    "using this fact , and after relabelling , eq .",
    "( [ rhodagger ] ) reduces to @xmath73 a direct implication of eq .",
    "( [ hermcon ] ) is that only half the bloch components , or @xmath74 , are _ independent _ , as the other half are simply the complex conjugates .",
    "hence , only half the bloch components are needed to define the density operator .",
    "of course , the independent bloch components are complex and we still have @xmath75 real parameters defining the density operator .",
    "a bloch component @xmath68 can be evaluated using the following relation : @xmath76    beyond the qubit case , it is not possible to visualise the entire state space with a geometrical picture similar to the bloch sphere .",
    "however , there have been some attempts to study the geometry of the state space in higher dimensions @xcite , and for a bloch type representation for qutrits @xcite .",
    "having fixed normalization and hermiticity , a mixed qutrit state is described by a complex vector @xmath77 .",
    "this complex vector space has a natural inner product , @xmath78 , a norm @xmath79 , and distance @xmath80 .",
    "these geometric concepts are related to the density matrix representation via @xmath81 since all pure state satisfy @xmath82 , this entails @xmath83 and all physical states are within a bloch - like ball of radius @xmath84 about the origin , with pure states on the surface of the bloch ball .",
    "the qubit state space is of course a special case in which all the points on the surface of the bloch sphere corresponds to positive physical states .",
    "the additional condition required to ensure a positive pure state , as shown in @xcite , is @xmath85 .",
    "the geometry vectors @xmath86 corresponding to physical states @xmath87 is quite intricate .",

    "recall that all the @xmath61 operators are traceless except for the identity operator @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the only terms that will survive in @xmath124 are the coefficients of the identity operator .",
    "we get the identity operator in @xmath125 when the @xmath61 operators in @xmath126 and the @xmath127 in @xmath128 have the opposite subscripts ( i.e. @xmath129 iff @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) . as a result",

    "( [ outbloch ] ) .    we have evaluated the expressions for the four output bloch components . however , writing them out in terms of @xmath68 notation is cumbersome .",
    "therefore , for clarity , we will relabel the four qutrit bloch components as follows @xmath139 .",

    "furthermore , it can be shown that the resultant expressions for the four output bloch components can compactly be expressed in terms of a single function .",
    "this function is given in eq .",
    "( [ dyneqns2 ] ) , and based on this function the distillation map can be expressed as @xmath142    these four expression represents the complete distillation map , as the remaining four components are simply the complex conjugates of these expressions .",
    "however , the above expressions do not incorporate the additional corrective clifford ( see sec .",
    "[ 5qutritcode ] ) , and will result to the cycling behaviour in app .",

    "this can easily be achieved in our formalism by the appropriate relabelling as follows : @xmath143 which is the corrected distillation map .",

    "it is known from the famous abel - ruffini theorem that there is no algebraic solution for a general polynomial of order five or above .",
    "therefore , the best way to discover the fixed points of the distillation is through numerical means .",
    "we started with initial states @xmath144 for certain bloch components and computed the above expressions for a number of iterations , and observed whether there is a convergence toward a fixed point .",
    "here we show that @xmath146 contains an infinite number of unitaries .",

    "<S> magic state distillation ( msd ) is a purification protocol that plays a central role in fault tolerant quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> repeated iteration of the steps of a msd protocol generates pure single non - stabilizer states , or magic states , from multiple copies of a mixed resource state using stabilizer operations only . </S>",
    "<S> thus mixed resource states promote the stabilizer operations to full universality . </S>",
    "<S> magic state distillation was introduced for qubit - based quantum computation , but little has been known concerning msd in higher dimensional qudit - based computation . here , we describe a general approach for studying msd in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we use it to investigate the features of a qutrit msd protocol based on the 5-qutrit stabilizer code . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this protocol distills non - stabilizer magic states , and identify two types of states , that are attractors of this iteration map . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how these states may be converted , via stabilizer circuits alone , into a state suitable for state injected implementation of a non - clifford phase gate , enabling non - clifford unitary computation . </S>"
