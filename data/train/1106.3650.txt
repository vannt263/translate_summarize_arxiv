    "once again , the momentum distribution of the impurity provides a signature of the transition ( cross - over ) between the superfluid and mott insulator ( tonks - girardeau ) regimes .    the difference in steady - state quasi - momentum distribution",
    "is related to the structure factor of the bose gas , c.f .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmanneq ] ) and ( [ eq : fgr4 ] ) , but a quantitive comparison with our simulations is difficult since in general they do not reach the steady - state .",

    "( b ) the same as ( a ) but for @xmath107 .",
    "( c ) also at @xmath93 we have plotted the purity of the density matrix @xmath146 as a function of tilt and interaction strength.,width=8 ]      so far we have focused on the evolution of the spatial and quasi - momentum distributions of the impurity , however more information is contained in its reduced density matrix @xmath147 .",
    "first , evaluating the elements of the density matrix in the wannier basis @xmath148 may tell us more about the effect of boson - impurity interactions on the impurity .",
    "another quantity that can be calculated from the reduced density matrix is the purity @xmath149 , which takes the maximal value @xmath150 if @xmath147 describes a pure state and decreases for increasingly mixed states .",
    "the initial state of the total system is a product of pure states for the impurity and bosons , and since we consider coherent evolution it remains pure .",
    "however , through interactions of the impurity with the bose gas the two subsystems are entangled resulting in a loss of purity of the impurity .",
    "our bosonic environment is sufficiently large that for most parameter values revivals are not observed and so we use purity to quantify the decoherence of the impurity .    to demonstrate the behavior of the density matrix @xmath147 we have plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : denmat](a ) and [ fig : denmat](b ) the absolute values of its wannier basis elements at @xmath93 for both intermediate and weak bosonic interaction strengths , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : denmat](a ) we observe a symmetric coherent interference pattern in the off - diagonal elements as the impurity undergoes bloch oscillations .",
    "additionally , density - density interactions with the bosons result in a slight decay of the off - diagonal coherences and an asymmetric distribution along the diagonal with a higher occupancy of the lower energy lattice sites .",
    "this decoherence is much more pronounced for a superfluid environment , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : denmat](b ) , and the resulting density matrix is nearly diagonal .    to make this relationship between the decoherence of the impurity and the internal interaction strength of the environment clearer , fig .",
    "[ fig : denmat](c ) shows the purity of the reduced density matrix of the impurity as a function of both tilt @xmath6 and interaction strength @xmath77 .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the coherence of the impurity is a clear signature of the cross - over between the superfluid and tonks - girardeau regimes .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath77 at which the most significant changes occur is around the same values where the transition occurs in a commensurate bose gas .",
    "we also calculated the entanglement entropy between the impurity and bose gas ( not shown here ) which showed very similar behavior to purity .",
    "if the bose gas is commensurately filled the transition between weak and strong interaction strengths makes an even clearer impact on the purity as deep in the mott insulator phase the impurity does not become at all entangled with the bose gas .    finally , comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : denmat](c ) and [ fig : numerical_example](d ) we find that the regimes of high transport coincide with those of the smallest purity ; the very same scattering processes that lead to the propagation of the impurity along the lattice also cause its decoherence",
    ". therefore the propagation of the impurity provides a controllable example of noise - enhanced transport .",
    "noise - enhanced transport is a topic of interest for those searching for quantum effects at room temperature which explain the remarkable efficiency of some biological systems  @xcite .",
    "we performed fully quantum many - body simulations of large ( 100 or more sites ) two - species systems using the tebd algorithm , simulating the one - dimensional motion of an impurity confined to a tilted optical lattice through a bose lattice gas .",
    "we discussed the esaki - tsu dependence of the current of the impurity on tilt and provided evidence that this shape is qualitatively obeyed by an impurity traveling through an incommensurately filled bosonic system of any interaction strength including the tonks - girardeau limit .",
    "contrasting this a very different dependence was found in the mott insulating regime .",
    "we discussed how deviations to the esaki - tsu shape depend on properties of the bose gas .",
    "information about the gas can then be extracted without needing to measure the bosons themselves , i.e. , non - destructively . in particular",
    "we discussed how the impurity could be used to probe the commensurateness of the system , and obtain the gap and bandwidth of its excitation spectrum .    following this we analyzed the transport of the impurity by considering its momentum distribution , showing that the semi - classical picture of an impurity of well - defined quasi - momentum emerges after a short time for bosons in the superfluid regime .",
    "we have also found a relationship between the decoherence and transport of the impurity ; our setup provides an experimentally accessible prototype of noise enhanced transport .",
    "the tebd algorithm efficiently simulates both the unitary and imaginary time - evolution ( according to @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively ) of quantum systems comprising a one - dimensional lattice of subsystems , each with a finite number of configurations , where @xmath153 is composed of nearest neighbor terms  @xcite .",
    "it does this by storing the state of a system as a matrix product state ( mps ) of dimension @xmath154 . in general , for an exact representation of the state vector the dimension @xmath154 and hence the resources required for the simulation must grow exponentially with the size of the lattice .",
    "however for ground and low - lying excited states of one - dimensional systems near - exact accuracy can be obtained using a much smaller @xmath154 that does not grow exponentially with system size  @xcite . with this being the case and using a suzuki - trotter decomposition of the operator @xmath155 ( without the @xmath2 for imaginary time - evolution )  @xcite the evolution may be simulated by the application of a polynomial number of two - site gates ,",
    "each followed by a re - compression into mps form , which can be done efficiently . for details , we refer the reader to  @xcite .    our system , described in sec .  [ sec : setup ] , is of this type provided we restrict the occupancy of the bosonic lattice to a finite number .",
    "to realize our scheme we first used tebd to find the ground state of the bosonic part of the system , with an on - site potential @xmath39 added at each site corresponding to an impurity .",
    "the initial state of the whole system was then the tensor product of this bosonic state with the initial state of the impurity , which consists of fock states with occupancies 0 or 1 .",
    "next , tebd was used to simulate the evolution of this state under the full hamiltonian @xmath156 .",
    "expectation values such as bosonic and impurity densities were easily extracted from the numerics due to the efficient contractibility of an mps .    for our simulations we used a maximum boson lattice - site occupancy of @xmath133 and",
    "the largest mps dimension we used was @xmath157 .",
    "our timestep was @xmath158 .",
    "these parameters were sufficient for the time - evolution considered here ; we found that increasing @xmath154 and decreasing @xmath159 resulted in no significant changes to the observables computed .",
