    "probabilities of ordinal patterns in equidistant discretizations of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) have first been analyzed by bandt and shiha @xcite .",
    "ordinal patterns represent the rank order of successive equidistant values of a discrete time series .",
    "for example , for three successive values there are six different possible outcomes of the rank order , which we call ordinal patterns of order @xmath0",
    ".    as bandt and shiha have shown , for equidistant discretizations of fbm the distribution of ordinal patterns is stationary and does not depend on the particular sampling interval length .",
    "further , the probabilities of ordinal patterns of order @xmath0 are all monotonically related to the hurst parameter , with the probability of ordinal patterns indicating changes from up to down and from down to up , respectively , being strictly monotonically decreasing in @xmath1 .",
    "the estimator of the hurst parameter obtained by plugging the sample relative frequency of changes between up and down into the monotonic functional relation to @xmath1 has been known for some time , running under the label ` zero crossing ' ( zc ) estimator since changes between up and down correspond to zero crossings of the first order differences .",
    "note that more generally , but not focussing on fbm , kedem @xcite has considered the estimation of parts of the autocorrelation structure of a stationary gaussian process by counting ( higher order ) zero crossings , that is , zero crossings of the first ( or higher ) order differences .",
    "the zc estimator is asymptotically normally distributed for @xmath2 , a result essentially due to ho and sun @xcite , who proved that the sample relative frequency of changes is asymptotically normally distributed in this case .",

    ", the applicability of the zc estimator has been examined by markovi and koch @xcite and shi et _ al . _",
    "@xcite , including simulation studies as well as the application to hydrological and meteorological data .",
    "the distribution of ordinal patterns is the base of ordinal time series analysis , being a new fast , robust and flexible approach to the investigation of large and complex time series ( see bandt @xcite and keller et _ al . _",
    "@xcite ) . from the viewpoint of ordinal time series analysis ,",
    "the estimation of ordinal pattern probabilities in stochastic processes is of special interest .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : sec .",
    "[ estopp ] is devoted to a general discussion of the estimation of ordinal pattern probabilities in fbm where we consider estimators based on counting the occurence of ordinal patterns in realizations .",
    "obviously , the sample relative frequency of ordinal patterns is an unbiased estimate of the probability of the patterns . as theorem [ raoblackwell ] shows , averaging the sample relative frequencies of ordinal patterns and of their ` time ' and ` spatial ' reversals , one obtains estimates which are strictly more concentrated in convex order .",
    "hence , we restrict our following considerations to such ` reasonable ' estimators .",
    "notice that theorem [ raoblackwell ] has important consequences for the estimation of functionals of ordinal pattern distributions such as the permutation entropy ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    for ordinal patterns of order @xmath0 one obtains two different estimators which can both be expressed as affine functionals of the sample relative frequency of changes . by lemma [ strongconsist ]",
    "we establish strong consistency and asymptotical unbiasedness for the estimators of bounded continuous functionals of ordinal pattern probabilities .",
    "theorem [ asnormtheo ] states that estimators of ordinal pattern probabilities are asymptotically normal for @xmath2 .    in sec .",
    "[ var ] , we consider the estimation of the probability of a change by the sample relative frequency of changes in some detail .",
    "we give a formula for the precise numerical evaluation of the variance of the sample relative frequency of changes as well as asymptotically equivalent expressions .",
    "based on these results , confidence intervals for the hurst parameter are provided in sec .",
    "[ conf ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sim ] , we compare the previous results to findings for simulations of fbm . as it turns out , the confidence intervals obtained from the zc estimator in sec .  [ conf ] cover the true unkown value of the hurst parameter for about @xmath3 per cent of the cases , even for small sample sizes and for the values of the hurst parameter larger than @xmath4 , where asymptotic normality of the zc estimator is not necessarily expected to hold .",
    "compared to the heaf estimator which estimates the hurst parameter by plugging the sample autocovariance into a monotonic functional relation to @xmath1 , the zc estimator has larger variance but much less bias , in particular for small sample sizes .",
    "notice that the results given in this work for the increments of fbm similarly apply to farima(@xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath5 ) processes .",
    "furthermore , the statistical properties of the estimates of ordinal pattern probabilities do not only apply to fbm , but also to montonic transformations of fbm .",
