    "in this paper we investigate the problem of imaging objects placed in air from time - dependent backscattering radar measurements , using a two - stage reconstruction method . in the first stage",
    ", initial images are calculated using the globally convergent method for coefficient inverse problems ( cips ) , which was originated in @xcite with a number of follow up publications ; results were summarized in the book @xcite . in the second stage , those images are refined using an adaptive finite element method ( adaptivity ) of @xcite .",
    "results of the first stage for the data sets considered in this paper were presented in @xcite . here , we present the results of the second stage .",
    "only the maximum value of the dielectric constant and the location of a target were accurately reconstructed in @xcite using the globally convergent method .",
    "the accuracy of the reconstruction of the shape of the target was limited .",
    "using the two - stage reconstruction procedure , it is shown here that we can simultaneously and accurately reconstruct all three components of interest of objects : refractive indices , shapes , and locations .",
    "we reconstruct these three components simultaneously as parts of an unknown coefficient , which is the spatially varying dielectric constant @xmath3 in the maxwell s equations .",
    "below @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the horizontal axis , @xmath6 is the vertical axis and @xmath7 is the axis which points from the target towards the measurement plane , see figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "even though only one component @xmath8 of the electric field @xmath9 was measured by our experimental device , we numerically solve here a cip for the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) maxwell s equations .",
    "the boundary data for two other components @xmath10 are obtained via computational simulations .",
    "experimental data were collected by a microwave device which was recently assembled at the university of north carolina at charlotte , usa . our desired application is imaging of explosives . in this paper",
    "we consider only targets located in air . the work on real data for the case when targets are buried under the ground",
    "is reported in @xcite .",
    "note that explosives may be located in air @xcite , e.g. , improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) .",
    "we image both homogeneous and heterogeneous targets .",
    "heterogeneous targets model ieds .    to collect those data , a single location of the source of electric pulses was used .",
    "hence , we used the minimal amount of the information .",
    "the use of more sources was both hard to arrange experimentally and undesirable for our target application . the backscattering time dependent signal was measured at a number of detectors covering a part of a plane , i.e. , over a narrow range of backscattering angles , see figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "that plane was placed behind the source .",
    "experimental data of this paper were collected for targets located in air on the distance of 80 centimeters from the measurement plane , which is 20 wavelengths , i.e. , in a far field zone .",
    "the distance between neighboring detectors was 2 centimeters .",
    "we refer to , e.g. , @xcite for treatments of experimental data in the frequency domain by other numerical methods for cips for maxwell s equations .",
    "in particular , blind real data were considered in @xcite . as to the adaptivity technique for inverse problems ,",
    "we refer to , e.g. , bj , li .",
    "there are many works dedicated to inverse problems of shape reconstruction ; we refer to some most recent ones , e.g. , liu1,liu2,t1,t2 .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for a survey about inverse problems of shape reconstruction .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec",
    ": stages ] we describe the two - stage reconstruction procedure . in section [ sec:3 ] we state the forward and inverse problems . in section [ sec : invprobl ] we present tikhonov functional and optimality conditions . in section [ sec : fem ] we describe the finite element method used in our computation . in section subsec : ad_alg we present the mesh refinement recommendation and the adaptive algorithm . some details of numerical implementation are described in section [ sec : numex ] . in section [ sec:8.2 ]",
    "we present reconstruction results .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in @xcite we have considered the problem of the reconstruction of the spatially distributed dielectric constant @xmath11 from experimental data , which were the same as in the current paper . in @xcite",
    "this function was the unknown coefficient in a wave - like pde @xmath12to reconstruct @xmath13 we have used the approximately globally convergent algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the notion of the approximate global convergence ( global convergence \" in short ) was introduced in @xcite .",
    "indeed , conventional least squares cost functionals for cips are non convex and typically have many local minima . hence , given a cip ,",
    "the first question to address in its numerical treatment is : _ how to obtain a good approximation for the exact solution without any a priori knowledge of a small neighborhood of this solution ? _ we call a numerical method addressing this question _ globally convergent_.    it is well known that it is tremendously difficult to address this question . for this reason , a certain reasonable approximation was made in bk , bkjiip12 .",
    "this approximation is used only on the first iteration of that method .",
    "because of this approximation , we call the technique of bk , bkjiip12 approximately globally convergent . due to that approximation",
    ", a room is left for a refinement of results .",
    "an important point here is that there exists a rigorous guarantee within the framework of that approximate model that the solution resulting from the globally convergent method is located in a small neighborhood of the exact solution .",
    "this is achieved without any a priori knowledge of a small neighborhood of the exact solution .",
    "thus , a locally convergent numerical method can be used for a refinement of the solution obtained by the globally convergent technique of @xcite .",
    "the latter is the main goal of the current paper .",
    "we synthesize here the adaptive finite element method of @xcite with the globally convergent numerical method of @xcite in order to improve the reconstruction of shapes of objects imaged in @xcite .",
    "the idea of this synthesis was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the synthesis represents the following two - stage reconstruction procedure :    * stage 1*. in this stage the approximately globally convergent method of @xcite is applied and a good first approximation for the exact solution is obtained .",
    "* stage 2*. this stage refines the solution obtained in the first stage .",
    "the locally convergent adaptivity technique of @xcite is applied .",
    "the solution obtained in @xcite in the first stage is taken as the starting point in the minimization procedure of the tikhonov functional .",
    "an important advantage of using the two - stage reconstruction procedure follows from theorem 1.9.1.2 of @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that the minimizer of the tikhonov functional ( i.e. , the regularized solution ) is closer to the exact solution than the first guess , provided , however , that the first guess is sufficiently close to the exact solution .",
    "therefore , that first guess should be delivered by the globally convergent method of the first stage .",
    "the adaptive finite element method of @xcite , which we use in the second stage , minimizes the tikhonov functional on a sequence of locally refined meshes , which is the main attractive point of the adaptivity .",
    "it enables one to maintain a reasonable compromise between not using an exceedingly large number of finite elements and a good accuracy of the resulting solution .",
    "it follows from theorem 4.9.3 of @xcite and theorem 5.2 of @xcite that if the first guess is sufficiently close to the exact solution , then the accuracy of its reconstruction monotonically improves with local mesh refinements . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in section 5.8.4 of the book @xcite that a locally convergent numerical method taken alone does not work for transmitted time dependent experimental data generated by a single source .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn for a different type of experimental data in @xcite .",
    "we model the electromagnetic wave propagation in an isotropic , non - magnetic space @xmath14 with the dielectric constant coefficient @xmath15 . the electric field @xmath16 satisfies the following cauchy problem : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the time - dependent waveform of the component @xmath8 of the incident plane wave , which is originated at the plane @xmath19 and propagates along the @xmath7-axis . in our experiment the component @xmath8 corresponds to the electromagnetic pulse which is sent into the medium .",
    "thus , in ( [ e_gauge1 ] ) as well as in our computer simulations of section [ sec : numex ] the incident field has only one non - zero component @xmath20 .",
    "this component propagates along the @xmath7-axis until it reaches the target , where it is scattered .",
    "let @xmath21 be a convex bounded domain .",
    "we impose the following conditions on the coefficient @xmath22 : @xmath23,~~\\varepsilon _ { r}(\\mathbf{x})=1\\text { for } \\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{r}^{3}\\diagdown \\omega ,   \\label{2.20}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 we a priori assume the knowledge of the constant @xmath25 .",
    "this means the knowledge of the set of admissible coefficients in ( [ 2.20 ] ) .",
    "however , we do not impose small - value assumptions on the unknown coefficient @xmath26 , i.e. , we do not assume that @xmath25 is small .",
    "here @xmath27 is the hlder space .",
    "let @xmath28 be the part of the boundary @xmath29 on which the backscattered data are measured .",

    "@xmath34      it is impossible to solve the problem ( [ e_gauge1 ] ) in the whole space @xmath35 .",
    "hence , we solve it in a bounded domain @xmath36 which contains our domain of interest @xmath37 .",
    "for the convenience of our local mesh refinement procedure , we use the domain decomposition finite element / finite difference method of @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "we decompose @xmath36 as @xmath38 with @xmath39 . here",
    "we use a finite element mesh in @xmath40 , and in @xmath41 we use a finite difference mesh .",

    "we do not use the whole 10 ns recorded data since after data preprocessing , they are shifted earlier in time and they do not contain any target s signal after 4 ns .      in the previous section , we implicitly assumed that our model is comparable to the experimental data .",

    "it is focused after the data propagation .",

    "however , here we work with the time domain data only . therefore , we use a new data calibation procedure we described below .",
    "let the function @xmath225 be our propagated experimental data .",
    "this function is given only on grid points @xmath226 we compute the maximal value of this function , @xmath227 usually the number @xmath228 is quite large .",
    "next , let @xmath229 be the function which is computed via solving the problem ( [ model3_1])-([model3_6 ] ) .",
    "we compute the maximal value of this function on @xmath80 @xmath230 } e_{2,sim}\\left ( \\mathbf{x},t\\right).\\ ] ] define @xmath231 next , we assign @xmath232 and use the function @xmath233 as the second component of the vector function @xmath213 in ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "two other steps of data preprocessing are due to ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 120 ] ) in section [ sec : invprobl ] .",
    "the final step of data preprocessing , the so - called `` immersing procedure '' is done as follows .          by ( [ 8.1 ] ) the rectangle @xmath72 is smaller than the rectangle @xmath238it is clear from the adjoint problem ( [ 16])-([18 ] ) that we need to get a proper data for the function @xmath20 for @xmath239 while having the data @xmath240 only for @xmath241 we now describe how do we extend the data from @xmath72 to @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the @xmath8-component of the solution @xmath242 of the forward problem ( [ model3_1][model3_6 ] ) with @xmath243 .",
    "then we define our immersed function @xmath244 for @xmath245 as @xmath246we choose the parameter @xmath247 in ( [ 5.109 ] ) in numerical experiments of section [ sec:8.2 ] .",
    "it follows from ( [ 5.109 ] ) that @xmath248 for @xmath249    figures [ fig : figure1_1 ] , [ fig : figure1 ] show that , depending on the parameter @xmath250 in ( [ 5.109 ] ) , the data immersing procedure not only allows to extend the data from @xmath72 to @xmath251 but also make the experimental data usable in our inverse algorithm .",
    "indeed , we note that the experimental data is measured at a very high frequency , say , @xmath252 , whereas our simulations are done at @xmath253 in order to reduce the computational cost .",
    "therefore , the experimental data are not compatible with the simulations .",
    "our immersing procedure helps to avoid solving the problem at a very high frequency . after this immersing procedure",
    "we solve the inverse problem using the algorithm of section [ subsec : ad_alg ] .",
    "results of the globally convergent algorithm of the first stage procedure have demonstrated that this algorithm provides accurate locations of targets as well as accurate values of refractive indices @xmath254 of dielectric targets and large values of appearing dielectric constants @xmath117 for metallic targets @xcite .",
    "however , it does not reconstruct shapes of targets well , especially the size in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "the latter is the reason why we apply the second stage to refine results of the first .",
    "let @xmath255 be the function obtained in the adaptive algorithm of section [ subsec : ad_alg ] .",
    "we form the image of the dielectric targets based on the function @xmath256 @xmath257 as to the metallic targets ( i.e. , the ones with large computed maximal values of @xmath258 we use the function @xmath259 @xmath260        this research was supported by us army research laboratory and us army research office grant w911nf-11 - 1 - 0399 , the swedish research council , the swedish foundation for strategic research ( ssf ) through the gothenburg mathematical modelling centre ( gmmc ) .",
