    "quantum coherence entails the existence of the interference effects amongst alternative histories of the quantum states .",
    "these effects are nevertheless not seen at the classical level .",
    "the suppression of quantum coherence can be viewed as the result of the unavoidable coupling to the environment , and thus leads to the emergence of the classical behavior in terms of incoherent mixtures .",
    "this environment - induced decoherence has been studied with the idea of quantum open systems by coarse - graining the environment where certain statistical measures are introduced  @xcite .",
    "thereby , this averaged effect appears as decoherence of the system of interest .",
    "in modern cosmology , many efforts have been devoted to studying how primordial perturbations , created quantum - mechanically during inflation in the early universe , undergo the processes of decoherence when their low momentum modes cross out the horizon  @xcite .",
    "they then reenter the horizon during the radiation- or matter - dominated stage and thus act as the seeds of temperature inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background as well as the matter density inhomogeneities that lead to the large - scale structure formation .",
    "in addition , special attention has been paid to the possible observation of decoherence effects in mesoscopic physics such as the phenomena of quantum tunneling , which are affected by the coupling with a heat bath  @xcite .",
    "recent revival of interest in the decoherence phenomenon is motivated by the study of the experimental realization of quantum computers in which the central obstacle has proven to preventing the degradation of the quantum coherence from the coupling of the computer to the environment  @xcite .",
    "understanding of the aforementioned problems relies on the deeper exploration of the decoherence dynamics driven by the environment .",
    "the quantum decoherence due to the interaction with the environment has been discussed by considering the interference of the electron states coupled to quantum electromagnetic fields in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the electron interference pattern may be altered by particle creation and vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields , and the change might be observed through the phase shift and the contrast change . however , imposition of the boundary conditions on quantum fields may result in the modification of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the best - known example is the attractive casimir force between two parallel conducting plates  @xcite .",
    "this casimir effect remains one of the least intuitive consequences of quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the presence of the boundary may further influence the electron interference and gives rise to observable effects",
    ". this type of the interference experiment can serve as a probe to understanding the nature of quantum fluctuations  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the decoherence dynamics of the electron coupled to quantum electromagnetic fields in the presence of the perfectly conducting plate .",

    ", this nonequilibrium formalism has been applied in particle physics and cosmology by one of us  @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the electron can then be derived with the method of influence functional , which takes account of backreaction .",
    "we assume that the electron is initially in a coherent superposition of two quantum states with their mean trajectory along the distinct paths .",
    "then the interference fringes can be observed when these states are recombined . the phase shift and amplitude reduction of the electron interference influenced by quantum fields",
    "are obtained from the influence functional .",
    "the leading effect of the decoherence functional comes from the contribution evaluated along the prescribed electron s classical trajectory defined by an applied potential .",
    "the validity of the approximation will be discussed  @xcite .",
    "note that this coherence reduction is given by the double surface integrals of the field strength correlation function defined in minkowski spacetime as we will see later . in this sense",
    ", it shares similar features with the known aharonov - bohm effect where the phase shift of the electron interference in the presence of the classical static magnetic field depends on the magnetic flux in the region from which the electron is absent .",

    "both effects arise from the interaction with quantum fields .",
    "the decoherence functional can be obtained from the expectation value of the anti - commutator of the vector potentials . however , in the semiclassical langevin equation to describe the stochastic dynamics of the particle coupled to quantum fields , the hadamard function also determines the noise correlation function from quantum field fluctuations which cause the stochastic behavior of the particle s trajectory  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can conclude that coherence reduction of the electrons is driven by field fluctuations . on the other hand , the phase functional , which is related to the retarded green s function for the commutator of vector potentials , link to the backreaction dissipation in the langevin equation on the dynamics of the particle  @xcite .",
    "thus , the phase shift may result from the backreaction dissipation from quantum fields through particle creation that influences the mean trajectory of the electrons .",
    "these two effects in the langevin equation obey the underlying fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in this aspect ,",

    "the closed worldline @xmath84 can be thought of as moving electron along its path @xmath85 in the forward time direction and then along the path @xmath86 in the backward time direction . by means of the 4-dimensional stokes theorem ,",
    "we can write the @xmath68 functional as @xmath87 which involves the hadamard function of the covariant vector potentials . it is consistent with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that although the expectation value of the vector potential @xmath88 in the electromagnetic vacuum state vanishes even in the presence of the boundary , the fluctuations of fields are non - zero in general .",
    "the decoherence effect in eq",
    ".   emerges as the result of the double surface integrals of the non - vanishing field correlations in minkowski spacetime .",
    "thus the decoherence is found sensitive to the field strength in the region where the electron is excluded . in this aspect",
    ", it may be regarded as the generalization to the aharonov - bohm effect with time - independent classical electromagnetic fields . in contrast , in our case , the decoherence effect is essentially driven by the non - static features of quantum fields .",
    "as for illustration , let us start by considering the @xmath89 functional for the unbounded space where electromagnetic fields are initially in the vacuum state  @xcite . the trajectory of the electrons can be dictated by an external potential along the prescribed paths .",
    "the velocity of the electron in the @xmath90 direction @xmath91 is assumed to be constant , while the motion in the @xmath92 direction varies with time .",
    "thus , the respective worldlines of electrons are given by @xmath93 .",

    "in particular , as the electrons are close to the plate , electron coherence is enhanced in the case where the path plane of the electrons is parallel to the plate .",
    "it is resulted from the suppression of zero - point fluctuations due to the boundary in the direction transverse to the plate . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron coherence is reduced in the perpendicular configuration where zero - point fluctuations are boosted instead along the direction longitudinal to the plate . in addition , in the presence of double parallel plates boundary , zero - point fluctuations seems to make the electrons more coherent in the parallel configuration , but less coherent in the perpendicular one , as compared with the single - plate boundary .",

    "<S> the influence of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations in the presence of the perfectly conducting plate on electrons is studied with an interference experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the electron is derived by the method of influence functional . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the plate boundary anisotropically modifies vacuum fluctuations that in turn affect the electron coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the path plane of the interference is chosen either parallel or normal to the plate . in the vicinity of the plate </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the coherence between electrons due to the boundary is enhanced in the parallel configuration , but reduced in the normal case . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the second parallel plate is found to boost these effects . </S>",
    "<S> the potential relation between the amplitude change and phase shift of interference fringes is pointed out . the finite conductivity effect on electron coherence </S>",
    "<S> is discussed . </S>"
