    "adiabatic theorem @xcite provides a very powerful tool for quantum state manipulation , and indeed it has been the basis of many applications , aimed at generation of quantum states @xcite or at the realization of quantum gates @xcite based on geometric phase @xcite .",
    "even if the wide range of validity of the adiabatic theorem has been recently criticized @xcite , very recently a sufficient condition that guarantees adiabatic evolutions has been proven @xcite .",
    "based on the adiabatic theorem , stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite allows the transfer of population from a quantum state of a physical system toward another state , through an auxiliary intermediate state @xcite .",
    "the passage occurs via a _ dark _ state , which aligns with the initial state in the beginning of the process , and then gradually changes its structure toward alignment with the target state .",
    "the process ends when the dark and target states coincide . for the opposite delay of the two couplings between the three states , and for nonzero single - photon detuning ,",
    "it is also possible to realize the b - stirap process , which instead exploits the adiabatic change of a _ bright _ eigenstate of the hamiltonian from the initial state to the target state .",
    "the main difference between stirap and b - stirap is that in the latter case the auxiliary state is effectively involved in the dynamics , in the sense that a certain amount of population is temporarily transferred to it during the process .",
    "this circumstance makes the b - stirap more sensitive than stirap to the presence of decay from the auxiliary level .",
    "in fact , while in the absence of environmental interaction and classical noise the transfer from the initial state to the target state is predicted to be perfect , in the presence of dissipative dynamics the efficiency of the process is negatively affected .",
    "many different models have been considered to study the effect of dephasing @xcite and spontaneous emission from the auxiliary level either toward external states @xcite or toward internal states @xcite , i.e. the initial and the target state . in all these models ,",
    "the incoherent dynamics has been taken into account phenomenologically . very recently , a microscopic model to describe the stirap and b - stirap processes under dissipation from the auxiliary state toward external states has been presented @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the master equation from a model of interaction between the three - state system and a bosonic environment , and the relevant dynamics , show some interesting deviations from the predictions related to the phenomenological counterpart . in particular , the microscopic model predicts a much higher efficiency in the stirap scheme .    in this paper , by using the same rigorous microscopic model as described above @xcite , we investigate the effect of spontaneous decay from the intermediate state inside the @xmath0-system .",
    "because the initial and final states in stirap are usually ground or metastable , the intermediate state is necessarily an excited state , which may decay both inside and outside the system @xcite .",
    "the loss of efficiency caused by external decay is more detrimental for it leads to irreversible population loss from the system ; it is also easier to describe and understand @xcite .",
    "the effect of internal decay on stirap is a much more subtle effect because the loss of efficiency is compensated by the concomitant optical pumping @xcite .",
    "here we develop a rigorous microscopic theory of internal decay in stirap and b - stirap , which reveals some unexpected features compared to the phenomenological model @xcite .",
    "starting from a microscopic model of system - environment interaction , we derive a time - dependent master equation that describes the dynamics of our system .",
    "then , after considering the resolution of the master equation , we compare the predictions coming from our model with the results coming from the phenomenological description of an analogous decay scheme @xcite .",
    "we find that the efficiency of the stirap process is higher than predicted before .",
    "exploiting the master equation at nonzero temperature , we also study the effects of temperature , showing that the thermal pumping dramatically and negatively affects the efficiency of the population transfer in the stirap process , while has a slightly positive effect in b - stirap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the derivation of the markovian master equation of a system with time - independent hamiltonian and a time - dependent system - environment interaction term . in the third section",
    "we apply the result of the previous section and the general theory of davies and spohn @xcite to derive the master equation of out three - state system .",
    "then , in the fourth section we show the results obtained at zero temperature and compare them with the results coming from the phenomenological model . in section",
    "v we show the effects of temperature , and finally in the last section we give some conclusive remarks .",
    "in this section we consider the general problem of the derivation of the master equation for a system whose hamiltonian @xmath1 is constant , while the system - environment interaction hamiltonian contains oscillation terms .",
    "this will be useful in the next section , where we deal with a system described ( in a rotating frame ) by a slowly - varying hamiltonian and interacting with a thermal bath through oscillating terms . according to the general theory by davies and spohn @xcite , under the hypothesis that the environmental correlation time is much smaller than the timescale of the hamiltonian change",
    ", we can treat this system by assuming that the system hamiltonian is time - independent during the derivation of the master equation , and putting the time - dependence of the jump operators only after the derivation .",
    "therefore we start by considering a time - independent system hamiltonian @xmath1 and the following time - dependent system - bath interaction hamiltonian : @xmath2    following the approach presented in @xcite , let us introduce , for each bohr frequency @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the projector on the subspace of the system hilbert space corresponding to the energy eigenvalue @xmath6 and the sum is extended over all the couples of energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",

    "indeed , in both cases the predictions from the microscopic and the phenomenological models are almost coincident for the intuitive sequence , while for the counterintuitive sequence we find that the microscopic model predicts a higher efficiency .",
    "nevertheless , we stress here the fact that the enhancement of efficiency in stirap in the strong damping limit is due to very different mechanisms in the two cases of external and internal decay .",
    "in fact , while for external decay a very strong damping is responsible for a dynamical decoupling of the dark state , which then is protected against losses , in the case of internal decay the dissipation is instead responsible for transitions toward the state that carries the population , therefore protecting the process of population transfer .",
    "in this section we consider the effects of nonzero temperature . looking at ( [ eq : ennediomega ] ) , we see that the @xmath59 s are evaluated at very close frequencies , which are essentially @xmath111 . for this reason , we described temperature by a single number @xmath112 which is the number of photons in the reservoir modes of frequencies close to the bare atomic transitions .",
    "we have seen that at zero temperature , for increasing @xmath101 ( and even for quite small values of the decay constant ) the efficiency falls down to zero when the intuitive sequence is applied .",
    "when temperature is non - vanishing all the transitions included in ( [ eq : mastereq_nonzerotemperature ] ) but not present in ( [ eq : mastereq_zerotemperature ] ) must be considered .",
    "in particular , transitions from @xmath55 to @xmath78 should increase the efficiency of the b - stirap process , since in this scheme the population is transferred through the state @xmath78 . on the other hand , in the counterintuitive sequence we should get a lower transfer efficiency , since thermal terms are responsible for loss of population from state @xmath55 during the stirap process .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed the effects on a stirap scheme of the losses of the auxiliary level towards the two metastable states , examined by means of the numerical resolution of a master equation which has been microscopically derived .",
    "it is worth noting that , in order to remove the rapid oscillations in the system hamiltonian , we are forced to describe the system in a rotating frame , where the system - bath interaction term turns out to be time - dependent .",
    "therefore , when deriving the master equation we have to deal both with a slowly varying system hamiltonian , which can be treated following the general theory by davies and spohn , and a rapidly oscillating system - environment interaction term .",
    "this last point makes the final master equation different from what one usually gets .",
    "indeed the zero temperature transitions are not guiding the system towards the dressed ( rotating ) ground state @xmath78 , but instead towards the state @xmath55 . in this sense , the oscillating terms in the system - environment interaction act like a pumping which makes the counterintuitive sequence much more robust than the intuitive sequence .",
    "the inclusion of the nonzero temperature terms in the master equation partially modifies these conclusions .",
    "in fact , thermal photons switch on different transitions , which make the post - pulse population of state @xmath78 different from zero . as a consequence the efficiency of the counterintuitive sequence is reduced , while on the other hand the efficiency of the intuitive sequence increases .",
    "however , such an increasing is not high enough to make the intuitive sequence preferable to the counterintuitive one .    though the analysis of this stirap scheme ( with the same decay channels ) , performed in previous papers by means of phenomenological dissipative terms ,",
    "has shown a high robustness of the counterintuitive sequence with respect to losses , our analysis shows that the scheme at zero temperature is much more robust for very high decay rates .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as already pointed out , the zero temperature decay channels force the system to the state @xmath55 , which is the population carrier in this sequence .",
