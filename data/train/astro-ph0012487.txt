    "we initially fit the emission lines as gaussians or sums of gaussians because this approach is commonly used and the resulting fits are generally quite acceptable .",
    "vilhu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the emission lines could be fit as a sum of narrow and broad gaussian components ( as found in general by wood , linsky , & ayres 1997 ) .",
    "the narrow components are significantly broader than the expected rotational broadening , and vilhu et al . interpreted this nonthermal broadening in terms of solar - like nonthermal broadening mechanisms ( e.g. , dere & mason 1993 ) ,",
    "perhaps related to microflares . unlike the case of the sun , we do not know much about the spatial distribution of the emitting gas .",
    "it probably is not confined to a thin region , given the evidence for extended prominences , in which case the atmosphere is extended and interpretation of line profiles is not straightforward .",
    "we simulated line profiles from photospheres ( with limb darkening parameters @xmath121.0  @xmath241.0 ) and from optically - thin extended co - rotating atmospheres , convolved them with the expected thermal broadening and with a gaussian instrumental response , and fit the lines as gaussians . in the case of @xmath25=0.6",
    "we recover the well - known rotational profile ( e.g. , gray 1992 ) ; @xmath25=0.0 is a uniform disk , and @xmath260 yields limb - brightened profiles .",
    "transition region lines are more likely optically thin emission from an extended atmosphere .",
    "we also examined cases where the emission is confined to low latitudes .",
    "limb - brightened atmospheres tend to produce flat - peaked line profiles ( for modest extents of @xmath2710% of the stellar radius ) , whereas limb - brightened atmospheres with emission confined to low latitudes produce emission cusps for sufficiently large @xmath9  sin  @xmath10 .",
    "although the intrinsic line profiles are not gaussian , significant noise and low resolving power allow gaussian fits to be acceptable in many cases .",
    "the widths of the gaussian fits always exceed @xmath9  sin  @xmath10 .",
    "we find that for photospheric line profiles , the gaussian fits overestimate @xmath28sin  @xmath10 by up to 40% , depending on the value of @xmath25 and the intrinsic @xmath28sin  @xmath10 .",
    "gaussian fits to limb - brightened profiles ( containing a few thousand counts ) overestimate the @xmath28sin  @xmath10 by 40 - 80% .",
    "dere & mason ( 1993 ) showed that optical thickness will also tend to broaden the line profiles ; in slightly thick but effectively thin lines , photons from the line core will be scattered into the wings .",
    "we caution the reader that the interpretation of emission line profiles is highly model dependent .",
    "consequently , we do not interpret the width of the narrow emission component of the transition region lines .    in figure  [ fig - mg2s ]",
    "we show the subordinate ( 3p @xmath29p@xmath30 3d @xmath29d@xmath31 ) line at @xmath19  2791.6 , which is almost certainly optically thin .",
    "the profile is flat - topped , and at resolution r@xmath1410@xmath32 the shape of the line profile is clearly not gaussian .",
    "the rotation profile for a limb - darkened photosphere is much more sharply peaked .",
    "figure  [ fig - mg2s ] demonstrates that this line can be produced by a limb - brightened , optically thin atmosphere with a height of a few percent of the stellar radius .",
    "this fit is not unique : within the uncertainties one could also fairly well reproduce the profile with , for example , a rotating photospheric profile ( @xmath25=0.6 ) with no emission above about 30@xmath33 latitude , or a uniform disk profile ( @xmath25=0.0 ) with emission confined below about 60@xmath33 latitude .",
    "the strong resonance lines of the transition region clearly can not be fit with a single component .",
    "instead we fit the lines as sums of narrow and broad gaussians .",
    "we find that we get better fits with three components : a broad component and two similar narrow gaussians displaced from line center by about @xmath16  0.5  @xmath9  sin  @xmath10 .",
    "this model gives better fits because the peaks of the and are flatter than a gaussian profile .",
    "physically , this is because in an extended limb brightened atmosphere the centroid of the emission is displaced to higher velocities where the path length through the atmosphere is longer .",
    "we also have had success in fitting the line wings with emission from an optically thin , extended , rigidly - rotating atmosphere ( see section  [ sec - trd ] ) .    [ [ section ] ]",
    "we identified 17 of the 24 integrations as likely to represent the non - flaring , quiescent transition region .",
    "the flux ( the sum of the fluxes in the @xmath151548,1551 lines ) during quiescence is less than 1.5@xmath310@xmath34  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 .",
    "vilhu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) noted that the non - flaring flux level just prior to our observation ranged between 1.0 and 1.5@xmath310@xmath34  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 , and the average flux during our entire observation is 1.2@xmath310@xmath34  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath151549/1551 line ratio of 1.78@xmath160.03 is close to but less than the optically thin limit .",
    "the summed quiescent line profile ( figure  [ fig - civ ] ) should represent the phase - averaged transition region .",
    "although we can fit the line with a sum of two gaussians with fit parameters similar to those of vilhu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we find that the data are better fit with three components .",
    "we plot neither the 2- or 3-component gaussian fits to this or any line in figures  [ fig - civ ] to [ fig - mg2k ] .",
    "rather , the fits to the high velocity wings shown in figure  [ fig - civ ] are for optically thin , constant density atmospheres extending out 2.5 stellar radii . forty percent of the total flux is in the extended component .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the mean  @xmath191393 line flux is 2.2@xmath310@xmath35  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 . from a visual examination of the line profiles and the line fluxes , we identified 20 quiescent spectra , and summed these ( figure  [ fig - siiv ] ) .",
    "the @xmath151393/1402 line ratio of 1.78@xmath160.02 is identical to that in the lines .",
    "although close to the optically thin limit , both line ratios are significantly less than 2 .",
    "this probably indicates that at least some of the emission is from optically thick regions .",
    "because the lines are well separated and because the blue wing of the @xmath191402 line is blended with ] @xmath191401.34 , we fit only the @xmath191393 line . as with the lines ,",
    "the line profile is better fit with a broad component centered on the rest velocity of the star plus two narrow emission components than it is with a two - gaussian model .",
    "if we fit the high velocity wings as emission from extended gas ( see figure  [ fig - siiv ] ) , we find that the emission extends out to 3 stellar radii , which is comparable to what we found for . about 25% of the emission is in the extended component .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    we obtained a single g160 m observation of the doublet at phase 0.5 .",
    "the line fluxes are 95% of those seen in the low dispersion spectrum .",
    "the line ratio of 2.10@xmath160.04 is consistent with the line s being optically thin .",
    "there is no evidence for the broad component seen in the and lines , perhaps because of the low s / n in this integration .",
    "however , there is a small flux excess on the red side of the @xmath191242  line .",
    "this is not seen on the blue side of the line , nor is it obvious in the @xmath191238  line .",
    "the cause could be a downflow , or perhaps a small flare on the receding limb of the star .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    we obtained a single g160 m observation of the doublet at phase 0.65 .",
    "the emission lines are severely blended , and we were unable to fit the various components uniquely .",
    "high velocity wings are evident .",
    "there is a strong interstellar absorption feature in the @xmath191334.5line , with a radial velocity of 9@xmath163  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "given the resolution of the ghrs in this mode , it is not possible to identify the absorption with any particular component of the interstellar medium ( see section  [ sec - mgism ] ) .",
    "corresponding ( though much weaker ) absorption is seen near the top of the @xmath191335.7  line .",
    "this spectrum also shows the @xmath191323.52 , @xmath191329.1 , and @xmath191351.66 lines with fluxes similar to those in table  [ tbl - lines ] .",
    "the transition region lines of active stars are generally modeled as the sum of broad and narrow gaussians .",
    "the width of the narrow component is generally significantly broader than the stellar @xmath9  sin  @xmath10 , and this is interpreted as the convolution of the stellar rotational profile with some other broadening mechanism .",
    "wood , linsky , & ayres ( 1997 ) showed that among dwarf stars , the excess broadening appears to decrease with increasing surface gravity ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the broad component is often interpreted as evidence for high velocity gas associated with microflaring .",
    "we have difficulty interpreting the line profiles of ab dor in this manner .",
    "after deconvolving the 90  km  s@xmath11 rotational velocity from the narrow central emission component we find that the velocity of the excess broadening mechanism is about 120  km  s@xmath11 , which places ab  dor well above the trend found by wood , linsky , & ayres ( 1997 ) for less active stars . and",
    "while microflaring may indeed exist and contribute to the width of the broad component , the evidence for spatially extended gas leads us to propose a fundamentally different mechanism for the broad line component .",
    "we propose that the high velocity wings are due to spatially - extended gas co - rotating with the star , and not to some unknown broadening mechanism .",
    "the existence of extended prominences seen in the light of h@xmath2 is well established ; it is likely that this same gas accounts for the extended wings of the @xmath37 lines .",
    "the wings of the transition region lines have very similar shapes , suggesting that these lines also have a similar origin .",
    "corroborating evidence for extended hot gas hot gas exists : walter et al .",
    "( 1995 ; 2001 in preparation ) show that c  iv undergoes absorption events associated with h@xmath2 prominences .",
    "we model the extended gas as a simple optically thin volume co - rotating with the star , and assume that the density is uniform between some inner and outer radii . the emission from each point",
    "is broadened by a thermal velocity appropriate to the ion in question .",
    "the computed profiles do not depend sensitively on the value of the assumed inner radius , since the emission from gas close to the star is hidden by the central emission component , but the outer radius does determine the width of the broad line component .",
    "we vary only the outer radius to match the observations .",
    "we can also vary the extent of the gas in latitude , but we are not very sensitive to this because gas at high latitudes has smaller velocities , and is buried under the central emission .    the inferred radial extent of the extended gas is close to the keplerian co - rotation radius of 2.8 stellar radii .",
    "we favor a model in which the gas is trapped by large - scale quasi - dipolar magnetic fields ( walter 1999 ) .",
    "such gas will be most stable near the co - rotation radius ( e.g. , the `` slingshot prominences '' of cameron & robinson 1989 ) .",
    "assuming that the gas is optically thin and in rigid rotation , we can use the high velocity wings to estimate the mean electron density in the extended gas .",
    "the mean electron density n@xmath38 is given by 0.8  @xmath39 , where l is the velocity - resolved luminosity of the line , p is the power in the line , v is the velocity - resolved volume element , and the 0.8 factor accounts for the fact that hydrogen is largely ionized .",
    "the mean density is about 5@xmath310@xmath40  @xmath5 at the temperature of the transition region lines for a filling factor of 1 ; the presence of discrete prominences suggests that the filling factor of this extended region is very low , and the density in the prominences must be commensurately larger .",
    "we see no evidence for any rotational modulation of the fluxes in the , , or lines .",
    "the photosphere is faintest at rotation phase 0.5 ( cameron et al .",
    "following solar analogy , the dark regions ( starspots ) are likely regions of larger photospheric magnetic flux and the bright chromosphere and transition region should be located above the starspots . if the chromosphere and transition region are spatially extended , as is likely the case here , then any modulation would be diluted .",
    "our data let us place a limit of 5% on the amplitude of the rotational modulation in the chromospheric and transition region lines .",
    "we observed the chromospheric @xmath0 & @xmath1 lines 19 times , approximately every 35 - 50 minutes , with a resolving power of about 10@xmath32 . the mean profile of the two lines is presented in figure  [ fig - mg2k ] .",
    "the @xmath0 & @xmath1 resonance lines are well - exposed , and the subordinate lines are detected as well . both the @xmath0 & @xmath1 lines exhibit extended blue wings , to velocities of about -320  km  s@xmath11 with respect to the star .",
    "the red wings can not be measured because the @xmath0 line is blended with the subordinate lines , and the red wing of the @xmath1 line falls off the edge of the detector .",

    "2001 , in preparation ) . the same prominences seen in absorption against the stellar disk should be seen in emission off the limb , and may account for the broad wings of the @xmath0 & @xmath1 lines .",
    "the maximum velocity is consistent with emission from gas in co - rotation at heights of up to 3.5 stellar radii . in figure  [ fig - mg2k ]",
    "we overplot the expected emission line profile , scaled to the data , for a co - rotating atmosphere extending to a height of 3 stellar radii .",
    "this is neither a fit to the data , nor it is a unique description of the data , but it demonstrates that the extended wings could arise from an extended atmosphere without assuming non - thermal broadening mechanisms .",
    "this extended emission accounts for 20% of the total @xmath0 & @xmath1 emission , after correcting for the interstellar absorption .",
    "the mean density in the extended atmosphere at chromospheric temperatures is about 3@xmath310@xmath41  @xmath5 ( for a filling factor of 1 ) .",
    "this is about a factor of 6 higher than the density inferred from the transition region lines , and within the uncertainties in consistent with a constant pressure atmosphere .",
    "the mean density at a given temperature provides clues to the gross morphology of the stellar atmosphere , since the emission measure ( @xmath42n@xmath38n@xmath43  dv ) depends on both the density and the volume . even at very low spatial resolution ,",
    "the observed density can help us discriminate between compact high density emitting regions and large extended structures .",
    "there are a number of density diagnostics in this region of the spectrum ( e.g. , doschek et al .",
    "we use the line strengths in tables  [ tbl - lines ] , [ tbl-1900 ] , and [ tbl-1400 ] to compute the density sensitive line ratios , and use the chianti software package to convert the line ratios to densities .",
    "we used 3 lines and the sum of the @xmath151294 - 1301 lines to form 4 line ratios .",
    "these consistently yield densities between 2 and 3@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 at a temperature of about 3@xmath310@xmath6k ( table  [ tbl - dens ] ) .",
    "cook & nicolas ( 1979 ) discuss using the lines to determine densities .",
    "we use the @xmath191175 , 1247 , and 1908  lines in this analysis .",
    "the densities are not mutually consistent ( table  [ tbl - dens ] ) .",
    "cook & nicolas ( 1979 ) note that in the sun the density ratios involving the @xmath191175 line are consistently off , perhaps because the @xmath191175 line intensity is reduced by optical depth effects .",
    "an increase of about a factor of two in the @xmath191175 line flux would bring the @xmath44 density into agreement with the @xmath45 density , at about 10@xmath46  @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath47 density would then become about 5@xmath310@xmath46  @xmath5 .    using the @xmath48 line ratio , schmitt , cutispoto , & krautter ( 1998 ) and ake et al .",
    "( 2000 ) both infer densities at the high density limit , @xmath2010@xmath46  @xmath5 , which is consistent with our estimates .",
    "the densities inferred from the lines ( formed at 6@xmath310@xmath6k ) are smaller than those inferred from ( formed at about 3@xmath310@xmath6k ) : in a constant pressure atmosphere they should have about half the density indicated by the lines",
    ". this would be consistent with a model in which the bulk of the transition region emission arises in constant pressure loops .",
    "cook & nicolas ( 1979 ) also estimate densities from ratios of ] @xmath191892 and  @xmath191402 to ]  @xmath191908 .",
    "these densities are valid so long as the relative abundances are solar .",
    "the @xmath49 ratio has traditionally been used as a density diagnostic in iue spectra ( doschek et al .",
    "we find this ratio to be about 1.3 , which suggests a density near 3@xmath310@xmath50  @xmath5 , but the @xmath51 ratio implies a density nearer 3@xmath310@xmath46  @xmath5 , using cook & nicolas model atmosphere ratios .",
    "note that the ] @xmath52 and ]  @xmath191908 line profiles are very different ( figure  [ fig-1900 ] ) , with the ] line nearly twice as broad , suggesting that they might not be formed co - spatially .",
    "the @xmath191400  region ( figure  [ fig-1400 ] ) includes a number of density - sensitive ] ( cook et al . 1995 ) and ] ( dufton et al .",
    "1982 ) intercombination lines .",
    "these lines are much weaker than the nearby resonance lines .",
    "the @xmath191399.8 and @xmath191401.2 ] lines are clearly visible in the low dispersion spectrum , blended with the blue wing of  @xmath191402.8 .",
    "we estimated their fluxes first by fitting all 3 lines , forcing the wavelengths and line widths of the ] lines to their expected values .",
    "since the two lines should have identical profiles , we then shifted , scaled , and subtracted the  @xmath191393.8 from the  @xmath191402.8 line profile , and fit the residuals .",
    "the @xmath191407.4 ] line is also visible in the low dispersion spectrum .",
    "these fluxes can be found in table  [ tbl - lines ] .",
    "we also searched for these lines in the summed g160 m spectrum ( total exposure time = 7368s ) .",
    "this spectrum is a global average over all rotational phases .",
    "although flaring affects the strong resonance line profiles and fluxes , we find no evidence of enhanced emission in the weaker lines during flares .",
    "as in the low dispersion image , there is clear evidence for extra emission on the blue wing of the  @xmath191402.8 line . using the same multi - line fitting procedure , we measure the line fluxes given in table  [ tbl-1400 ] .",
    "we note that high dispersion does not improve the flux measurements signficantly , because the lines are over - resolved due to rotational line broadening , and the rotational line broadening causes line blending .",
    "we measure the @xmath53 line ratio to be 2.1@xmath160.5 , which is marginally consistent with the expected value of 0.993 . due to the poor accuracy of the flux determinations ,",
    "the density diagnositics are inconclusive .",
    "similarly , the line ratios are inconclusive",
    ". the @xmath191423.9 line is blended at low resolution with a stronger line .",
    "although there is a weak line near @xmath191416.9 in the low dispersion spectrum , no line of similar strength is seen in the higher resolution spectrum .",
    "the densities listed in table  [ tbl - dens ] range from about 10@xmath54  @xmath5 to 3@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "the densities derived from the four line ratios using the lines are self - consistent but larger than the other diagnostics , while those involving ]  @xmath191908 are systematically low .",
    "as discussed above , an arbitrary doubling of the  @xmath191175 line flux ( justified because it appears to works for the sun ) brings the @xmath47 density into better agreement with the densities ( table  [ tbl - dens ] ) , while leaving all the densities based on ]  @xmath191908 consistently lower by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the systematically lower densities indicated by the ratios involving the ]  @xmath191908 line can be reconciled if the ]  @xmath191908 line is preferentially formed in the extended , low density region near the co - rotation radius .",
    "this would explain both the significant broadening of the ]  @xmath191908 line , and the enhanced line strength .",
    "the fwhm of the ]  @xmath191908 line ( table  [ tbl-1900 ] ) corresponds to about 3  @xmath9  sin  @xmath10 , and so is consistent with formation in a region close to the co - rotation radius .",
    "we believe that the most reliable density estimate is n@xmath38=23@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 from the line ratios because of the consistency among the four ratios",
    ". the electron pressure at 30,000k would then be p@xmath38=n@xmath38t=69@xmath310@xmath55  @xmath5k , about 100 times the value for the quiet sun .",
    "we present an emission measure distribution based on the observed line fluxes in figure  [ fig - emd ] .",
    "we use the line emissivities tabulated by landini & monsignori fossi ( 1990 ) , interpolated with a cubic spline .",
    "landini & monsignori fossi computed the line emissivities in the low density limit .",
    "since much of the flux seems to arise in a high density atmosphere , we used the chianti database to determine the relative emissivities at low and high densities , and used this to determine proper emissivities for the few density - sensitive lines .",

    "we have also added the far uv line fluxes from orfeus ii ( schmitt , cutispoto , & krautter 1998 ) , after multiplying the orfeus ii fluxes by 1.1 to bring their  @xmath191175 and  @xmath191206 fluxes into agreement with our measurements .",
    "the extrapolation of the emission measure of the cooler coronal component is in good agreement with the fluxes of the , , , and lines , especially considering the non - simultaneity of the uv , fuv , and x - ray observations .",
    "a number of lines seem to have emission measures above the minimum .",

    "three other lines are clearly out of place .    * ]  @xmath191908 implies an emission measure 1.5 orders of magnitude larger than that of the other lines , which are consistent with the trends from other species .",

    "there is considerable evidence that the sun lies inside a small cloud , called the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) , of warm partially ionized gas moving with a single  valued bulk flow velocity of 26 km s@xmath11 from galactic coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 , roughly the direction of the sco  cen association ( crutcher 1982 ; lallement et al .",

    "observations of @xmath2  cen and 36  oph indicate that the interface between the lic and the g  cloud is located @xmath61  0.19  pc from the sun roughly in the direction of the galactic center ( linsky & wood 1996 ; wood , linsky , & zank 2000 ) . a three  dimensional model of the lic",
    "was developed by redfield & linsky ( 2000 ) based on 32 lines of sight using hst , euve , and ground based spectra . in their model",
    ", the lic extends about 5 pc in the anti  galactic center direction , and a fraction of a parsec in the galactic center direction , so that the sun is located just inside the very edge of the lic . for the line of sight toward ab  dor ,",
    "the model predicts the presence of very little lic material .",
    "the lines of ab  dor contain two broad interstellar absorption features .",
    "we fit the ism features in the mean  @xmath1 and  @xmath0 lines simultaneously to maximally constrain the heliocentric velocity @xmath9 ( km s@xmath11 ) , the doppler parameter @xmath62 ( km s@xmath11 ) , and the column density @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the best fit is illustrated in figure  [ mgismfig ] .",
    "to estimate the `` continuum '' against which the absorption features are measured , we use observed fluxes on either side of the absorption features and fluxes derived from mirroring the red  side of the line together to fit a fifth  degree polynomial .",
    "this `` continuum '' is shown in figure  [ mgismfig ] as the thin solid line . for a given set of interstellar parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath62 , @xmath65 ) ,",
    "the profiles for the interstellar absorption features were computed and then convolved with the echelle  b lsa instrumental profile ( gilliland & hulbert 1993 ) . in figure  [ mgismfig ]",
    "the absorption profiles of the individual ism components are shown as dotted lines , and the convolution of these components with the instrumental profile is shown as the thick solid line .",
    "a scattered light correction was made by simply subtracting a small flux level across the whole spectrum .",
    "numerous fits were made with different estimates of the scattered light correction factors in order to estimate the systematic errors .",
    "for the most part , the uncertainties are dominated by the random error .",
    "the derived parameters for these interstellar absorption components are listed in table  [ mtbl ] .",
    "the two broad interstellar absorption features in the lines can be resolved into three different components  one with a heliocentric velocity of 5.17  km  s@xmath11 and the other two with velocities of 14.5 and 19.6  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "a two component model inaccurately fits the high velocity feature in the  @xmath0 line , so a third component was added to adequately fit the flattened appearance of the high velocity absorption feature between 14 and 19  km  s@xmath11 . since the quality  of  fit does not improve significantly with the addition of a fourth component , the data do not require more than three components . with a galactic longitude of @xmath66 and a latitude of @xmath67 ,",
    "the projected lic velocity toward ab  dor should be 4.25  km  s@xmath11 and the corresponding g  cloud velocity should be 5.29  km  s@xmath11 . because the projected velocities of the lic and g  cloud are so similar in value , it is difficult to interpret the observed 5.17  km  s @xmath11 component as being associated with only one or the other cloud . the fit itself seems to favor the g  cloud projected velocity vector , and based on the lic model and observations of other nearby stars ( @xmath2  cen and 36  oph ) we expect very little lic material along this line of sight .",
    "the lic model predicts a hydrogen column density of @xmath68  =  16.88 ( redfield & linsky 2000 ) . using a typical magnesium depletion for the lic of d(mg )  @xmath14  1.1  @xmath16  0.2 from piskunov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the predicted column density contribution of the lic in the direction of ab  dor is only @xmath63  @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the lic should be a small contributor to the observed 5.17  km  s@xmath11 interstellar absorption component",
    ". however , if this absorption component is associated with the g  cloud , the large doppler parameter , @xmath71  km  s@xmath11 , implies a large turbulent velocity .",
    "if we assume a temperature typical for the g  cloud , @xmath72 , based on observations of @xmath2  cen and 36  oph ( linsky & wood 1996 ; wood , linsky , & zank 2000 ) , the turbulent velocity is then @xmath73 , where we have used the equation @xmath74 with @xmath75 for magnesium .",
    "other turbulent velocities measured for the g  cloud by linsky & wood ( 1996 ) and wood , linsky , & zank ( 2000 ) have significantly lower magnitudes .",
    "this high turbulent velocity could be caused by a shearing of the gas , possibly near the interface of the cloud .",
    "however , it is more likely that because the lic and g  cloud projected velocities are so close , we are unable to differentiate between them in the spectrum .",
    "both clouds may be contributing to the broad absorption feature , leading to the appearance of a large doppler parameter and turbulent velocity if the absorption is ascribed to only one cloud .",
    "the observed 14.5 and 19.6  km  s@xmath11 components have not yet been identified with any previously detected cloud .",
    "we have presented the overall quiescent characteristics of ab doradus as it appeared during our 1994 november hst / ghrs observations . the transition region and line profiles provide evidence for significant amounts of material co - rotating with the star out to at least 3 stellar radii with temperatures extending from the lower chromosphere to at least 10@xmath32k .",
    "this picture supports a model with extended gas confined near the keplerian co - rotation radius ( 2.8 stellar radii ) by large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "we surmise that most of the detected emission , the @xmath1460@xmath1280% emitted in the narrow line component , arises in high density , small scale height regions close to the photosphere .",
    "the extended material may well be at a lower density , as indicated by the low density derived from the @xmath76}~\\lambda 1892}{\\rm{c iii]}~\\lambda 1908}$ ] line ratio , since both lines are depleted at high density ( with the ] line depleted faster ) .",
    "formation of the ]  @xmath19  1908 line in the low density extended gas would explain both the broad line profile and the large flux .",
    "these quiescent spectra alone contain a wealth of information , and show that high signal - to - noise , high dispersion spectra of magnetically active stellar chromospheres and coronae provide important insights into the spatial morphology of the stellar magnetospheres .",
