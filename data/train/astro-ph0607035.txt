    "it is generally thought that pulsar radio emission is produced in the open field line region well inside the light cylinder ( lc ) ( the radius at which the corotation speed equals @xmath0 ) .",
    "radio emission generated inside the lc must propagate over a substantial part of the magnetosphere before escaping to the interstellar medium .",
    "the intense radio emission is subject to various interactions with the intervening plasmas within the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "two types of interactions have been considered : cyclotron absorption in which electrons ( positrons ) are in cyclotron resonance with the wave ( blandford & scharlemann 1976 ; fussell , luo , & melrose 2001 ) , and induced compton scattering in which the radio wave is scattered to a higher or lower frequency  @xcite .",
    "both processes can affect or even disrupt the propagation of the beam .",
    "so far , no clear observational evidence for the absorption feature associated with the cyclotron resonance has been identified .",
    "however , the conventional polar cap theory , which assumes that the radio emission is generated in an outflowing electron - positron pair plasma , does predict a cyclotron resonance region where absorption should occur . induced",
    "compton scattering can be important in principle for any coherent emission with a sufficiently high intensity  @xcite .",
    "while cyclotron absorption is important only in the region near the lc , induced scattering can occur throughout the magnetosphere .",
    "apart from these two processes , there is a third process that involves induced wave - wave interactions and that can significantly affect propagation of the radio beam .",
    "a highly collimated beam of radio waves can generate low frequency waves through three - wave interactions in the pulsar magnetospheric plasma in a way similar to wave generation in a particle beam instability .",
    "these low frequency waves interact with the radio waves , leading to a decrease in its intensity and an increase in its angular spread . in some cases ,",
    "such effects can completely disrupt the radio beam : the medium becomes opalescent to the radio waves .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the effect of induced three - wave interactions on propagation of radio emission in a pulsar magnetosphere . induced three - wave processes have been considered for pulsar winds @xcite , pulsar eclipse by the stellar wind of its companion  @xcite and radio emission from active galactic nuclei  @xcite . apart from a discussion of raman scattering ( a particular case of three - wave interactions , cf .",
    "2.5 ) in a pulsar magnetosphere  @xcite , we are aware of no detailed study of the three - wave effect which explicitly takes account of the beaming and broadband nature of the radio emission .",
    "to our knowledge , there is no detailed study of propagation of radio emission in the closed field line region .",
    "here we consider the three wave effect both in the open field line region ( oflr ) and in the closed field line region ( cflr ) .",
    "in most models , propagation of radio emission is confined to the oflr where the relativistic electron positron pair plasma streams along magnetic field lines at a relativistic velocity . because electrons and positrons contribute to three - wave interactions equally but with opposite sign , three - wave interactions are significant weakened in a quasineutral pair plasma .",
    "however , such processes can still be important for radio emission with very brightness temperature provided that there is a modest excess of electrons or positrons and that the bulk lorentz factor is modest . since for young pulsars , the conventional polar cap model generally predicts a plasma density too high for propagation of radio waves , we assumes that the plasma is highly inhomogeneous across the polar cap and that radio emission is generated at a frequency near the plasma frequency ( in the plasma s rest frame ) in the underdense region where the plasma density is relatively low ( cf .",
    "this assumption seems to be required for consistency if the radio emission is produced due to a beam instability @xcite .",
    "propagation of radio emission in the cflr is relevant at least for three specific cases : ( 1 ) the recently discovered double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039b in which the radio emission from one pulsar interacts with the plasma in the cflr of the other , ( 2 ) radio emission from outer magnetospheric regions where the emission of the trailing component may propagate to the cflr as a result of the aberration effect , and ( 3 ) backward emission predicted by the oscillatory polar gap model  @xcite and by recent models for the peculiar ` notch - like ' feature of pulse profiles  @xcite . for case",
    "( 1 ) , eclipse of the radio emission from one pulsar by the magnetosphere of the other has been observed .",
    "a possible interpretation of the eclipse is due to processes in the clfr such as cyclotron or synchrotron absorption or induced scattering . for case",
    "( 2 ) the trailing component may have an absorption - like feature or may be completely destroyed as the result of strong induced processes . for the third case , induced processes can severely constrain visibility of the backward emission that propagates through the cflr .    in sec .",
    "2 , we outline a general formalism of induced three - wave interactions in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we discuss the effect on propagation of radio emission in the oflr in sec . 3 and in cflr in sec .",
    "we consider three - wave processes due to passage of beamed radio emission ( referred to as a photon beam or radio beam ) .",
    "the processes involve two high frequency waves ( unscattered and scattered radio waves ) and a low frequency wave generated by the radio beam .",
    "the three waves satisfy the resonance conditions @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the condition @xmath3 means that three wave scattering is approximately ` elastic ' .",
    "we model pulsar radio emission as a highly collimated photon beam , described by the photon occupation number @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wave frequency and @xmath6 is the wave vector .",
    "the photon occupation number is a lorentz invariant , related to the brightness temperature @xmath7 through @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "let @xmath10 be the occupation number of the low - frequency wave with frequency @xmath11 and wave vector @xmath12 .",
    "evolution of @xmath4 , @xmath13 and @xmath10 are determined by three kinetic equations which are completely determined by the three - wave probability @xcite : @xmath14 , where the delta functions are the three - wave resonant conditions and @xmath15 in ( [ eq : w ] ) , which is simply referred to as the three - wave probability , @xmath16 is the quadratic response tensor , @xmath17 is the ratio of the electric to total energy of the low frequency wave , and the polarizations of three waves are @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in deriving the three - wave probability ,",
    "we adopt the cold plasma form for the quadratic response tensor , e.g. eq ( a1 ) in  @xcite , and take the strong magnetic field limit .",
    "one should note that the strong field limit may not be appropriate for the region near the lc .",
    "nonetheless , it allows us to simplify the quadratic response tensor greatly . in this limit",

    "the final expression for the three - wave probability is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the classical electron radius and @xmath33 .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : w2 ] ) is closely analogous to a similar expression for an unmagnetized plasma  @xcite where the low frequency waves are the langmuir waves ( @xmath34 ) . for a quasi - neutral , cold electron - positron plasma",
    ", one has @xmath35 ; one then needs to retain higher order terms in an expansion in @xmath36 to obtain a nonzero three - wave probability , which is much smaller than ( [ eq : w2 ] )  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we consider two low frequency modes that may be relevant to induced three - wave interactions : the langmuir mode that propagates along the magnetic field , and the alfvn mode ( also called the low frequency @xmath37 mode ) which can propagate at any direction .",
    "note that the three - wave process involving a langmuir wave in the ( coherent ) fixed - phase formalism is also called stimulated raman scattering ( cf .",
    "landau damping imposes a lower limit to the wavelength of low frequency waves . to determine the landau damping one need consider separately an intrinsically relativistic plasma such as in the oflr and a nonrelativistic plasma such as in the cflr .",
    "landau damping in an intrinsically relativistic plasma occurs preferentially for @xmath38 since the plasma is relativistic even in the plasma rest frame and the particle s cerenkov resonance occurs for the wave phase speed near the speed of light . in the nonrelativistic plasma , landau damping is effective for electrostatic waves with @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the debye length )  @xcite , leading to a limit on the maximum @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath42 , three - wave interactions involves low frequency electrostatic waves should be important in the cflr where the plasma is expected to be nonrelativistic ( cf .",
    "4.1 ) . in the oflr",
    "the plasma is intrisically relativistic , landau damping limits the refractive index of the langmuir waves to about 1 , and both the alfvn and electrostatic modes need to be considered .",
    "we consider the production rate of scattered photons as a measure of the effect of the three - wave process on the photon beam .",
    "this rate , which we also call the scattering rate , depends on the level of the low frequency waves generated by the photon beam .",
    "we consider the case where the low frequency waves are saturated as the result of change in the occupation number of the photon beam . the saturation condition @xmath43 leads to a level of low frequency waves expressed in terms of the photon occupation number .",
    "thus the scattering rate can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angular spread of the photon beam .",
    "our specific model for an axially symmetric beam is @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the beam width and the polar angles @xmath49 are defined with respect to the beam axis .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath50 for the polar angles of @xmath12 .",
    "the polar angles of @xmath6 and @xmath12 relative to the magnetic field ( @xmath51 axis ) are given respectively by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "since the angular spread of the beam is small , hereafter we do not distinguish between the beam axis and @xmath6 .",
    "substituting ( [ eq : w2 ] ) for ( [ eq : gamma ] ) yields @xmath54 where we express the incoming photon occupation number in terms of the brightness temperature : @xmath55 , and @xmath56 depends on the specific low frequency mode involved and is derived in sec .",
    "2.3 and 2.4 .",
    "from ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) one may define the opacity for the photon beam propagating over a distance @xmath57 : @xmath58 in ( [ eq : tau ] ) , @xmath59 can be estimated from the observed flux density @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the frequency in hz , @xmath57 is the distance from the emitting region to the region concerned and @xmath63 is the pulsar distance .",
    "if one assumes the size of the emission region is @xmath64 , one has @xmath65 .",
    "the brightness temperature is estimated to be @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "consider first the case where the low frequency waves are langmuir waves propagating along the magnetic field at a low phase speed @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) .",
    "three - wave interactions favor the back scattering regime where the incoming and scattered photons propagate in opposite directions . from the three - wave resonance conditions one has @xmath70 ( parallel to the magnetic field ) and @xmath71 ( perpendicular to the magnetic field ) , which gives rise to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath34 . because of @xmath74 , one must have @xmath75 , corresponding to the incoming and scattered photons propagating in opposite directions .",
    "hence for langmuir waves , one derives @xmath76 provided that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is determined by the landau damping .",
    "the angular range for back scattering to occur is @xmath79 with @xmath80 . when the photon beam is parallel to the magnetic field , one has @xmath81 , which implies that only photons off the beam axis with @xmath82 can interact with the langmuir waves . in a nonrelativistic plasma",
    ", one has @xmath41 and hence the back scattering can be very efficient .",
    "in the regime @xmath83 , the three - wave interactions resemble particle - wave interactions , with high frequency waves ( the radio emission ) acting like ` particles ' that can emit or absorb low frequency waves @xcite .",
    "this regime is also called the small angle scattering because the angle between the incoming and scattered photons is small , given by @xmath84 .",
    "the three - wave resonance conditions reduce to the cerenkov resonance condition between ` particles ' ( the high frequency wave ) with a velocity @xmath85 and a wave with @xmath86 .",
    "specifically , one may define a cerenkov angle @xmath87 , corresponding to a conical surface with respect to @xmath88 , which defines the cerenkov resonance condition .",
    "the condition can only be satisfied for a subluminal wave @xmath89 , i.e. its phase speed must be less than @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in negative absorption ( or growth ) of the low frequency waves , which occurs for @xmath90 , at a rate determined by the three - wave probability ( [ eq : w ] ) or ( [ eq : w2 ] )  @xcite .",
    "the instability of low frequency waves leads to diffusion of photons in the @xmath6-space , determined by the diffusion coefficient @xmath91 , where the three - wave probability @xmath92 is given by ( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "the growth of low frequency waves is entirely due to the anisotropic angular beaming of the photons .",
    "a decrease in the beaming , over the perpendicular diffusion time @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , is especially important as it can ultimately suppress the growth . assuming that the low frequency waves are saturated due to perpendicular diffusion",
    ", one can derive the total diffusion time @xmath95 , which describes the effect of the instability on the beam .",
    "one finds @xmath96 is the same as that given by ( [ eq : gamma ] ) or ( [ eq : gamma2 ] )  @xcite and the diffusion effect can be estimated by evaluating the opacity ( [ eq : tau ] ) . for langmuir waves , one finds @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "similarly for alfvn waves one has @xmath99 where the parallel component of the polarization is @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the induced three - wave interaction discussed here and induced ( or stimulated ) compton scattering requires comment .",
    "( we use ` induced ' and ` stimulated ' interchangeably here . ) both processes need to be considered in discussing the propagation of radiation with very high brightness temperature , and we regard them as independent of each other . in our view , the difference between these two processes has become somewhat obscured by discussions of stimulated raman scattering .",
    "formally , raman scattering is associated with particles ( atoms or molecules ) that have an intrinsic transition frequency , @xmath103 say , associated with them .",
    "spontaneous raman scattering of incident radiation with frequency @xmath5 produces scattered radiation at the stokes frequency , @xmath104 , and at the anti - stokes frequency , @xmath105 .",
    "stimulated raman scattering is analogous to absorption of the beat between the incident and scattered radiation , and occurs at a rate that is proportional to the product of the intensities at the incident and the scattered frequencies .",
    "this leads to exponential growth at the stokes frequency , and an associated exponential decay at the incident frequency , so that radiation is transferred from higher to lower frequency at an exponentially increasing rate .",
    "( if the scattering particles have an inverted energy distribution , negative absorption or maser action results in an exponentially increasing transfer from the incident frequency to the anti - stokes frequency . )",
    "induced compton scattering is analogous to induced raman scattering , except that there is a continuum of frequencies for the scattered radiation .",
    "for isotropic radiation with a peak in the intensity at some frequency , induced compton scattering tends to move this peak to lower frequencies ; if there are two distinct beams of radiation , induced compton scattering tends to transfer radiation from the beam at the higher to the beam at the lower frequency .",
    "the direction of transfer is reversed if the scattering particles have an inverted energy population , and this has been suggested as a mechanism for generating giant pulses  @xcite .",
    "the induced three - wave interaction discussed here is essentially the same process described as ` stimulated raman scattering ' by gangadhara and krishan ( 1993 ) and as ` induced raman scattering ' by lyutikov ( 1998 ) except that in our case the low frequency wave is not restricted to plasma waves .",
    "the important distinction , as noted by lyutikov ( 1998 ) , is that in the induced three - wave interaction , the raman frequency , @xmath103 , is replaced by the frequency of the low frequency waves , which is the plasma frequency , @xmath24 , in cases of interest .",
    "however , this analogy is only kinematic , and the dynamics of the two processes are quite different ; for example , they are described by different kinetic equations . in the induced three - wave interaction the plasma may be regarded as passive , determining the wave dispersion and the nonlinearity that allows the three - wave coupling .",
    "the kinetic equation involves on the wave distributions : the low frequency waves grow and result in the scattering of the high - frequency waves .",
    "in contrast , in induced compton scattering , the plasma particles actively scatter the high - frequency waves , the process depends explicitly on the distribution function for the particles , and no low - frequency wave is involved .",
    "the formalism derived in the preceding section can be applied to the case of propagation of radio emission in the oflr where the plasma has a bulk velocity @xmath106 and a lorentz factor @xmath107 .",
    "a convenient approach is to treat the formalism in sec . 2 in the plasma rest frame and then derive the relevant quantities in the pulsar or observer s frame by a lorentz transformation .",
    "note that some caution is needed in defining the bulk rest frame .",
    "since the plasma streams along curved magnetic field lines , there is no single bulk frame .",
    "however , one can still construct a consecutive series of local bulk frames along the curved field lines , an approach similar to that used in ray tracing in a relativistically flowing plasma  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the photon beam is axially symmetric in the plasma rest frame .",
    "the photon beam shape varies from frame to frame .",
    "such complication is not considered here , though it should be included in a full radiative transfer calculation .",
    "specifically , the relevant propagation angle is transformed according to @xmath108 all tilde quantities correspond to the rest frame .",
    "we ignore the pulsar s rotation in the lorentz transformation .",
    "the brightness temperature , frequency , differential solid angle and plasma frequency are transformed according to @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , where the refractive index is @xmath113 .",
    "since the time derivative in ( [ eq : gamma ] ) is interpreted as the total time derivative , i.e. @xmath114 with @xmath115 , one has @xmath116  @xcite . upon making the lorentz transformation",
    "one obtains the scattering rate in the observer s frame : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the pair multiplicity . in ( [ eq : gamma3 ] ) , we use @xmath119 and rewrite the plasma frequency as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the plasma frequency corresponding to the number density of the excess electrons or positrons .      the scattering rate is proportional to the local net charge density : a higher net charge density implies a faster scattering rate .",
    "this is due to the electrons and positrons contributing with opposite sign to the three - wave coupling coefficient .",
    "for the conventional polar cap model the number density of the excess charge is the goldreich - julian ( gj ) density , given by @xmath122  @xcite , where @xmath123 is the star s radius .",
    "seemingly insurmountable difficulties arise if one assumes the most widely discussed emission mechanism ( a beam instability ) in a plasma with the gj density times a multiplicity @xmath124 .",
    "the lowest frequency consistent with theory is @xmath125",
    "@xcite , where @xmath126 is the lorentz factor s mean spread in the plasma rest frame , about 1 - 10  @xcite . in the following",
    "we assume @xmath127 implying @xmath128 .",
    "for example , the plasma frequency predicted for the crab pulsar is @xmath129 , corresponding to @xmath130 for @xmath131 , which is too high compared with the observed frequency .",
    "( this plasma density problem was discussed by @xcite . ) one practical solution to this problem is that the plasma is highly inhomogeneous forming underdense regions where radio emission is produced and propagates .",
    "the low density region where the density is actually much lower than @xmath132 can form as a result of nonuniform extraction of primary particles from the polar cap or nonuniform pair cascades  @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the primary particle density is nonuniform across the polar cap forming localized outflowing fluxes along field lines separated by low density regions where the net charge density is much less than @xmath133 ( though on average the mean flux density from the polar cap is still @xmath134 ) .",
    "both the multiplicity @xmath118 and the net charge density can be low in the underdense region .",
    "in the following we consider the case where the radio wave is emitted in the low density regions at a frequency near the local plasma frequency .",
    "specifically we assume ( 1 ) the radio frequency is @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the local plasma frequency at the emission radius @xmath137 and @xmath138 is the mean multiplicity , and ( 2 ) @xmath139 is a constant along the propagation path .",
    "assumption ( 1 ) is applicable if the coherent radio emission is due to wave - particle interactions @xcite .",
    "although assumption ( 2 ) may not be realistic , particularly in the oscillatory case where both the multiplicity @xmath118 and the net charge density can be nonstationary @xcite , it is a reasonable approximation provided that the size the scattering region ( @xmath140 ) is much larger than the length scale ( corresponding to the polar gap length ) of plasma inhomogeneities along the propogation path .",
    "these two assumptions allow us to estimate ( [ eq : gamma3 ] ) without going into much details on a particular polar cap model .",
    "we consider the following three propagation regimes separately : two quasi - parallel regimes , including the forward propagation @xmath141 and backward propagation @xmath142 , and quasi - perpendicular regime @xmath143 .      in the forward propagation regime @xmath144 , @xmath145 is nearly parallel to the magnetic field . assuming the low frequency plasma wave propagates along the magnetic field , one has @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we assume that the photon beam is in the @xmath37 mode with the polarization in the @xmath148-@xmath6 plane , because only this high frequency mode can be produced through wave - particle interactions  @xcite .",
    "if one assumes that the radio emission is generated near the frequency @xmath135 at the emission radius @xmath137 , the plasma frequency in the rest frame is comparable with the photon frequency .",
    "thus the only relevant low frequency waves are alfvn waves .    for the alfvn mode",
    ", one can show that three - wave interactions due to the projection of the polarizations of all three waves along the magnetic field are small .",
    "from ( [ eq : xi3 ] ) , which applies in the rest frame , one obtains @xmath149 , where @xmath150 . for @xmath151 and @xmath152 ,",
    "one has @xmath153 .    in most part of its propagation path the radio emission propagates backward in the rest frame ,",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : angle ] , and in this regime the low frequency approximation is justified . from ( [ eq : lt ] ) , one has @xmath154 for @xmath155 , i.e. the emission propagates backward ( @xmath142 ) in the rest frame . in the rest frame the frequency is given by @xmath156 .",
    "since @xmath157 , one has @xmath158 or @xmath159 , where @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "thus for backward propagation , the langmuir waves can be treated as low frequency waves ( @xmath159 ) and back scattering ( cf sec .",
    "2.3 ) is allowed kinematically but is inhibited by the landau damping . for backward propagation",
    ", the @xmath37 mode is elliptically polarized , with only a small component along the magnetic field @xmath162 . from the three - wave resonance conditions one finds @xmath163",
    ". however , landau damping limits the refractive index to @xmath147 .    for backward propagation",
    ", the three - wave interaction can proceed in the regime @xmath83 where both langmuir and alfvn waves are relevant . from ( [ eq : xi2 ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath164 for the langmuir waves with @xmath165 and from ( [ eq : xi3 ] ) one has @xmath166 for the alfvn mode .",
    "thus , alfvn waves are less efficient than langmuir waves .",
    "the transition between forward and backward propagation , @xmath167 , in the rest frame corresponds to @xmath168 in the pulsar frame .",
    "a photon beam that is emitted initially along the magnetic field rapidly acquires an angle as the magnetic field lines bend away ( cf . figure  [ fig : angle ] ) .",
    "the propagation enters the quasi - perpendicular regime ( @xmath143 ) after the distance @xmath169 .",
    "similarly to forward propagation , the plasma frequency is comparable with the radio frequency in the rest frame .",
    "so , the plasma waves can not be treated as low frequency waves .",
    "the relevant low frequency waves are the alfvn waves . from ( [ eq : xi3 ] ) we have @xmath170 .",
    "although the process favors a higher @xmath11 , the alfvn mode is heavily damped near the plasma frequency .",
    "it can freely propagate in the range @xmath171 .",
    "for example , one may choose @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "this gives @xmath174 .",
    "to calculate ( [ eq : gamma3 ] ) , we determine the plasma frequency in the propagation path from @xmath175(r_*/r)^{3/2}$ ] with @xmath176 in the quasi - perpendicular region .",
    "note that for young pulsars such as the crab pulsar the local plasma frequency determined in this way is much lower than the one derived from the density @xmath177 ( cf .",
    "sec 3.1 ) .",
    "the opacity @xmath178 is estimated as @xmath179 where ( [ eq : tb ] ) with @xmath180 is used .",
    "it should be noted that if the emission is from a region spread over @xmath140 , the opacity estimated from ( [ eq : tau2 ] ) is reduced .",
    "if one assumes the nominal value @xmath181 for typical pulsar parameters , eq . (",
    "[ eq : tau2 ] ) shows that the induced diffusion is not important for radio emission with a moderately high brightness temperature .",
    "however , it can be effective for young pulsars or pulsars that emit giant pulses .      for giant pulses the opacity ( [ eq : tau2 ] ) can well exceed unity and as a result",
    ", it imposes a severe constraint on their propagation .",
    "giant pulses have been observed from a few pulsars with the two best examples being the crab pulsar  @xcite , a fast rotating young pulsar and psr 1937 + 21  @xcite , the second fastest millisecond pulsar .",
    "the distribution of pulse energy ( the flux density times the typical pulse width ) is power - law , in contrast to normal radio pulses that have a log - normal distribution  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the emission mechanism for giant pulses is distinct from that for normal radio pulses .",
    "although the emission mechanism for giant pulses is not well understood , recent study of giant pulses in relation to the corresponding high energy emission suggests that the emission region may be in or near the outer magnetospheric region where the high energy emission originates  @xcite .",
    "here we show that the opacity constraint ( [ eq : tau2 ] ) excludes the possibility of giant pulses originating from the inner magnetosphere and deduce that they must come from the outer magnetosphere , near the lc .",
    "the opacity ( [ eq : tau2 ] ) decreases with increasing emission radius .",
    "this feature can be understood as follows .",
    "the efficiency of induced three - wave processes depends on the photon energy density .",
    "for an emitting source of size @xmath64 , the photon energy density in the quasi - perpendicular region ( at a distance @xmath140 from the source ) is proportional to @xmath182 .",
    "observations of nanosecond giant pulses from the crab suggest a source size of order a meter @xcite .",
    "this density decreases with increasing @xmath137 , leading to a weakening of three - wave interactions . for giant pulses from the crab pulsar",
    ", one has an average flux density @xmath183 . we have @xmath184 unless a large emission radius @xmath137 is assumed . for giant pulses not to be strongly affected by the induced process , corresponding to the condition @xmath185 , the emission radius must satisfy the condition @xmath186 where @xmath181 .",
    "although the pair multiplicity is not well constrained , ( [ eq : r * ] ) still gives a strong constraint on the emission radius for a reasonable parameter range .",
    "a recent numerical simulation suggests that the conversion efficiency of the primary particle energy to pairs is well below unity  @xcite , corresponding to @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the primary particle s lorentz factor . for young pulsars ,",
    "resonant inverse compton scattering is the dominant emission process for pair - producing photons and it is reasonable to assume @xmath189 .",
    "this gives an upper limit @xmath190 . applying ( [ eq : r * ] ) to the crab pulsar , assuming a distance @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 one finds @xmath194 , about @xmath195 of the lc radius @xmath196 .",
    "one concludes that for giant pulses to propagate without being dispersed by induced three - wave interactions , they must be emitted very close to the lc radius . for the millisecond pulsar psr 1937 + 21 ,",
    "one expects @xmath118 to be small and @xmath197 to be large as pair production in the millisecond pulsar s magnetic field is much less efficient .",
    "assuming that the primary particle s energy is limited by curvature radiation corresponding to @xmath198 , one has the upper bound @xmath199 .",

    "2 can be directly applied to the cflr where the plasma consists of single - sign charged particles with the gj density @xmath133 and is stationary with a zero bulk velocity .",
    "all the relevant quantities discussed in sec .",
    "2 are now referred to the pulsar frame .",
    "in contrast to the polar region , the plasma in the cflr is plausibly stationary in the corotating frame .",
    "since particles are in the ground landau state they do not have a perpendicular momentum , so there is no magnetic mirror effect that can trap a dense plasma .",
    "this feature is very different from the usual planetary magnetosphere in which a plasma is trapped due to this effect .",
    "thus , in the absence of continuous injection of pairs the plasma density in this region is controlled by the pulsar s rotation in such way that the charge density is @xmath205  @xcite .",
    "the plasma in this region consists of particles with a single sign of charge ( either electrons or positron or possibly protons ) , which can be treated as an electron gas in one dimension ( along the field lines ) . assuming the magnetic field as a function of radius @xmath206 : @xmath207 , where @xmath208 for a magnetic dipole",
    ", one may express the density as @xmath209 . using ( [ eq : tau ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath210 where @xmath56 is given by ( [ eq : xi ] ) for back scattering and ( [ eq : xi2 ] ) for the quasilinear diffusion approximation . notice the difference in the radial distance dependence in ( [ eq : tau3 ] ) compared to ( [ eq : tau2 ] ) .",
    "this difference is due to the gj density varying with radial distance proportional to the magnetic field , where we ignore a cosine factor .",
    "the cflr region is separated into a positive charge region and a negative charge region , with the boundary between them called the null surface .",
    "one may define a radius @xmath211 where @xmath212 .",
    "the opaque region corresponds to @xmath213 , where induced three - wave processes are important .",
    "this critical radius is derived as @xmath214 we are interested in the region sufficently far from the star s surface such that the condition @xmath215 is satisfied .",
    "we discuss only the case where the low frequency waves are electrostatic .",
    "we first apply ( [ eq : tau3 ] ) to the double pulsar system j0737 - 3039b , in which radio emission from one pulsar is periodically eclipsed by the other .",
    "it is of interest to consider if induced scattering can provide an effective mechanism for such eclipse .",
    "the system consists of pulsar a with the period 22.7 ms and magnetic field @xmath216 , and pulsar b with the period 2.8 s and magnetic field @xmath217 .",
    "the two pulsars are in a nearly circular orbit ( with the eccentricity @xmath218 ) , with the orbital plane seen nearly edge - on , at an inclination angle @xmath219 to the line of the sight  @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that the nearest impact distance of the photon beam from pulsar a to pulsar b is about @xmath220 ( of pulsar b ) .",
    "the plasma frequency at @xmath221 is about @xmath222 .",
    "cyclotron absorption is probably unimportant because the plasma density is too low  @xcite .",
    "consider interaction of a photon beam from pulsar a with the magnetospheric plasma of pulsar b. the brightness temperature of the radio emission from pulsar a is estimated to be @xmath223 at @xmath224 at @xmath225 . to estimate the opacity ,",

    "one estimates @xmath231 .",
    "the possibility of injection of relativistic pairs in the magnetosphere of pulsar b was recently discussed by @xcite , also @xcite . in rafikov & goldreich s model , trapping of a dense pair plasma is possible due to particles nonzero pitch angles that are acquired as a result of synchrotron absorption of radio emission from pulsar a. since the opacity is proportional to the net charge density and is unchanged by the addition of pairs .",
    "thus , we conclude that the induced three - wave process is not important for this binary system",
    ".      induced three - wave processes may be relevant in the outer magnetosphere for radiation originating near the last open field lines .",
    "waves can be swept into the cflr and this effect is especially important for a class of pulsars with double peaks with a wide separation of nearly @xmath232 . in the single pole model ,",
    "the main ( the leading main ) and inter ( the weak trailing ) pulses originate from emission from the opposite sides of a wide cone at rather high altitudes .",
    "two components are often asymmetric in intensity with one ( normally the leading component ) being stronger than the other .",
    "one plausible interpretation of such asymmetry is that waves from the trailing component are partially absorbed due to cyclotron absorption  @xcite .",
    "since the trailing component can be swept into the cflr , induced three - wave process is a possible alternative mechanism for its suppression .      to derive the condition for the radio emission to propagate across the cflr we assume that the photon trajectory is straight in the observer s frame . in the co - rotation frame",
    ", the photon trajectory appears as a spiral curve .",
    "we consider an orthogonal rotator with the line of sight crossing the magnetic axis in the equatorial plane and emission from one pole only .",
    "in the corotating frame , one assumes a static dipole with field lines described by @xmath233 , where @xmath234 , @xmath235 is the half opening angle of the polar cap , and @xmath236 is the colatitude of the field line foot point on the star s surface .",
    "the last open field lines correspond to @xmath237 .",
    "assume that waves are emitted at the radial distance @xmath137 on the last open field field lines .",
    "after propagating a distance @xmath238 the radial distance is approximately @xmath239 .",

    "the condition can easily be satisfied for emission originating from a large emission radius and a field line close to the last open field line @xmath247 .",
    "the fate of the radio emission that propagates into the cflr is determined by the opacity ( [ eq : tau3 ] ) .",
    "we consider psr 1937 + 21 and the crab pulsar . for psr 1937 + 21",
    ", we have the mean flux density @xmath248 at 400 mhz and 16 mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the brightness temperature times @xmath45 at @xmath249 is estimated to be @xmath250 and @xmath251 , respectively .",
    "the maximum depth from the last closed field lines boundary is @xmath252 for @xmath253 , @xmath254 . for @xmath255 one",
    "has @xmath256 . using ( [ eq : rcr ] ) and assuming @xmath257 and @xmath258 , one finds @xmath259 .",
    "the opacity at @xmath260 is @xmath261 at @xmath262 and it is even larger at a lower frequency .",
    "this implies that propagation in the cflr is inhibited .",
    "since both the leading and trailing components are visible , the emission must be produced at a radius where its trailing part does not propagate into the cflr . from figure",
    "[ fig : gc ] , this radius must be in the range @xmath263 or @xmath264 . since the lc radius is only @xmath265 and @xmath266 , the only permitted radial range is @xmath264 . alternatively , one may assume the radio emission occurs in a region away from the last closed field line surface and in this case it propagates only in the oflr .",
    "however , one needs to assume a two - pole model to explain the double peak feature .    for the crab pulsar ,",
    "the observed flux density is @xmath267 at 400 mhz and @xmath268 at 1.4 ghz , corresponding a spectral index @xmath269 .",
    "this gives @xmath270 for @xmath271 at @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "since the propagation in the cflr is nearly parallel , one has back scattering with @xmath274 . since both the leading and trailing pulses",
    "are observed , the emission radius must be in the range @xmath263 or @xmath275 .",
    "induced three - wave processes impose a severe constraint on any model involving backward emission in the pulsar frame .",
    "backward emission may be relevant for oscillatory gap models such as proposed by  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "pair cascades occur in an oscillatory manner sending secondary particles both forward and backward .",
    "this would lead to two photon beams propagating in opposite directions .",
    "backward emission is also proposed for interpretation of specific features of the pulse profile ( dyks et al .",
    "it is suggested here that the backward propagating waves must pass through the cflr and undergo strong induced scattering .",
    "as the zeroth order approximation , one assumes the photon beam is confined to the magnetic meridian plane and ignoring both aberration and general relativity , one may estimate the radial distance to the crossing point @xmath276 from @xmath277 .",
    "this gives @xmath278 where @xmath279 is assumed , and @xmath280 .",
    "the polar angles @xmath281 and @xmath282 can be expressed in terms of the relevant radii : @xmath283 and @xmath284 . on substituting them into ( [ eq",
    ": rc ] ) , one finds the solution @xmath285 . when aberration is included , the propagation path of the backward emission bends toward the star in the corotating frame .",
    "a more rigorous treatment is outlined in appendix . since for fast rotating young pulsars or fast millisecond pulsars , the critical radius @xmath211 is close to or larger than the lc radius , propagation of the backward emission in the cflr",

    "for example , as shown in sec 4.3 , the crab pulsar has @xmath286 for @xmath287 .",
    "for the backward emission not to pass through the opaque region ( @xmath288 ) , the emission radius must satisfy @xmath289 .",
    "this implies that no backward emission can pass through the cflr .    for a typical pulsar",
    ", the critical radius can be smaller than the lc radius .",
    "pulsars satisfy this condition ( @xmath290 ) must have a period @xmath291 backward emission can propagate through the region @xmath292 , provided that the emission is produced close to the lc , @xmath293 .",
    "we consider psr b0950 + 08 as an example .",
    "it has a period @xmath294 and a magnetic field @xmath295 .",
    "we estimate @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "backward emission can propagate through the cflr if the emission region is at @xmath298 .",
    "note that @xmath299 can be much larger than unity . for @xmath300 ,",
    "one has @xmath301 . thus even for a typical pulsar , propagation of radio emission in the cflr",
    "is strongly constrained and is allowed only in the region near the lc .",
    "we consider the effect of induced three - wave turbulence on propagation of the radio emission in a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "( as remarked in sec . 2.5 , this process is sometimes referred to , inappropriately we believe , as ` stimulated raman ' or ` induced raman ' scattering . )",
    "the low frequency wave is either an electrostatic plasma wave propagating along magnetic field lines or an alfvn wave propagating nearly along the magnetic field .",
    "we discuss both cases of propagation in the oflr and cflr . in the polar ( oflr ) region",
    ", the induced processes strongly depend on the bulk velocity of the plasma and on the pair multiplcity ( @xmath118 ) . since the scattering rate ( cf .",
    "[ eq : gamma3 ] ) decreases for increasing @xmath197 and @xmath118 , the induced three - wave scattering effect on the propagation is suppressed due to the relativistic bulk flow ( @xmath302 ) and @xmath303 . assuming a modest bulk lorentz factor @xmath304 and a multiplicity @xmath305 for a young pulsar like the crab pulsar , and @xmath306 and @xmath307 for a fast millisecond pulsar like psr 1957 + 21",
    ", we show that propagation of radio emission in the oflr is little affected by the induced three - wave processes .",
    "an exception is the propagation of giant pulses . if the giant pulses are emitted relatively close to the star , they are subject to very strong induced processes that prevent them from escaping .",
    "the favored region where induced processes can be effective is the transition region located at @xmath140 from the source , where the photon beam propagates nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field in the rest frame . for giant pulses not to be completely destroyed by such processes , their emission region needs to be close to the lc .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the conclusion reached by @xcite from a different argument , based on the alignment of giant pulses with the high energy emission",
    ".    induced three - wave interactions are generally important for propagation of radio emission in the cflr . because the plasma in this region is stationary in the corotating frame , with @xmath308 , the processes are much more efficient than in the polar region",
    "the induced three - wave processes are important throughout the cflr except for pulsars with a relatively long period .",
    "we discuss three specific examples where the processes are relevant .",
    "( 1 ) for the double pulsar j0737 - 3039b , we find that the processes discussed here are not efficient enough to explain the observed eclipse , due to the very low plasma density of the cflr of pulsar b which has a relatively long period .",
    "however , the induced three - wave scattering can be effective if one assumes a density much higher than the gj density ( by a factor of @xmath309 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that a much higher plasma density is needed in the synchrotron / cyclotron absorption model as well  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) our result imposes a strong constraint on the location of the emission region of pulsars with a pulse profile with widely separated leading and trailing components .",
    "there is a particular radial range where the trailing component may be swept into the clfr due to aberration .",
    "( 3 ) our result limits the visibility of backward emission .",
    "the backward emission must propagate through the cflr where it can be dispersed due to three wave interactions . for young or fast millisecond pulsars ,",
    "the radius of the opaque region ( where induced three - wave interactions are important ) is comparable with or larger than the lc radius . in this case , backward emission may not be visible . for long period pulsars ,",
    "the plasma density in the cflr is low and the radius of the opaque region is smaller than the lc .",
    "the backward emission can propagate through the magnetosphere provided that it is produced sufficiently close to the lc and that its propagation path is outside the opaque sphere .",
    "an important approximation made in our discussion is the strong magnetic field limit .",
    "although such an approximation excludes the possibility of cyclotron resonance , our result should be valid for a finite , strong magnetic field .",
    "this is because the relevant frequency of the low frequency waves ( langmuir and alfvn modes ) in the induced three - wave interactions considered here is much lower than the cyclotron frequency throughout the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "in the non - rotating frame , a photon beam is assumed to be emitted at @xmath310 in the field line direction and to propagate along a straight line described by @xmath311 where @xmath312 is the distance propagated in time @xmath313 , @xmath246 is the slope of the photon beam , and @xmath314 correspond respectively to the forward and backward emission . here ,",
