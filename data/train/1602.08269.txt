    ", the advent of ultra - cold atoms @xcite has opened the way to the experimental realization of nearly ideal one - dimensional integrable quantum systems , triggering new efforts in understanding the physical implications of integrability . as a natural consequence , integrable quantum field theories have then recently enjoyed a refreshed theoretical interest .",
    "this is particularly true in connection with the study of the non - equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems , which is the object of an intense on - going research activity @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a relevant body of literature has been focusing on the determination of the stationary value reached by local correlations of the systems at late times after a quantum quench , i.e. a sudden change in the hamiltonian parameters . in this context",
    "the behavior of integrable systems is special because of the presence of an infinite set of local conserved operators ( or charges ) constraining the dynamics at all times .",
    "it is then natural to conjecture that the asymptotic properties of the system are captured by a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) taking into account all the conserved charges @xcite .",
    "the gge construction allows to predict the physical properties of a macroscopic system without explicitly solving the whole non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "indeed , one takes into account only a limited amount of information on the initial state ( encoded in the expectation value of the conserved charges ) to characterize the eventual stationary value of correlations of the system .    in the past years",
    ", an impressive amount of work has been devoted to test the gge and understand its range of applicability @xcite . in order to obtain exact predictions on the asymptotic state ,",
    "the gge approach requires the _ a priori _ knowledge of a complete set of local or quasilocal conserved charges of the model at hand ( at least for the sector of the hilbert space specified by the symmetries of the initial state ) . in general",
    "this is a highly non - trivial problem , as demonstrated by the recent discoveries of additional conservation laws in integrable quantum spin chains @xcite and integrable field theories @xcite .",
    "a different approach has recently been proposed to describe the long - times steady state following a quench in integrable systems : the so called quench action method ( qam ) , a.k.a .",
    "representative eigenstate approach @xcite .",
    "the latter has proven to be a powerful and versatile technique which has been applied in the study of quenches in heisenberg spin chains @xcite , interacting bose gases @xcite , quantum field theories @xcite and transport problems @xcite .",
    "in the recent works @xcite it has been possible to apply in some special cases the qam to tackle the computation of the whole time evolution of local observables in interacting models . however , this remains in general an extremely difficult task .",
    "explicit results for the computation of the whole post - quench time evolution were also obtained by independent approaches in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the difficulties in the application of the qam are almost entirely encoded in the exact determination of the initial state in the basis of the post - quench hamiltonian .",

    ", the post - quench stationary state is identified with an excited representative eigenstate of the post - quench hamiltonian , rather than a statistical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic stationary value of the time - dependent local correlation functions can then be obtained as the expectation value of the corresponding local operators on this representative eigenstate .",
    "note , however , that the computation of these correlation functions remains generically an open problem .",
    "this scenario is common in many - body physics : even in integrable quantum field theories , where the scattering matrix is exactly known , the computation of correlation functions is an extremely difficult task , which has been investigated mainly for the vacuum state or at finite temperature @xcite . in the study of quantum quenches ,",
    "the physical characterization of the eventual stationary state requires the computation of correlation functions in generic , non - thermal , highly excited states .",
    "this problem has not been addressed until very recently and only in the past few years some progress has been made in this direction for the simplest case of one - point correlation functions @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in massive integrable quantum field theories with diagonal scattering matrix , one - point functions for excited states can be calculated using the leclair - mussardo formalism @xcite .",
    "this is a non - trivial achievement , since the latter was originally conceived and derived to compute expectation values at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "importantly , the application of the leclair - mussardo series has recently led to remarkable results for one - point functions in the one - dimensional @xmath0-interacting bose gas ( namely , the lieb - liniger model ) , both for thermal and arbitrary excited states @xcite .",
    "these results are based on a mapping between the sinh - gordon field theory and the lieb - liniger model , which is the non - relativistic limit of the former @xcite .    despite its conceptual significance ,",
    "the application of leclair - mussardo formalism in relativistic field theories is in general still not satisfactory from a computational point of view .",
    "indeed , far from perturbative regimes , explicit numerical evaluation of the leclair - mussardo series requires to retain a large number of terms , each term involving the computation of non - trivial multiple integrals . in the sinh - gordon model ,",
    "an alternative approach to obtain thermal expectation values of arbitrary vertex operators was recently proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and explicit expressions for the latter were derived .",
    "the advantage of these formulae lies in the fact they do not involve infinite series and can be numerically evaluated for arbitrary values of the temperature with high efficiency .    in this work we focus on the sinh - gordon model and we address different issues discussed in this introduction .",
    "in particular , we consider quantum quenches from a particular class of initial states , which include the case of mass and interaction quenches from the non - interacting theory . by means of the qam",
    ", we fully characterize the stationary state reached at late times and we explicitly verify that the generalized gibbs ensemble constructed using the conserved rapidity occupation numbers provides the same predictions of the qam for the long - times behavior of the system . motivated by the work of refs .",

    "@xcite , we propose a formula for one - point correlation functions for arbitrary excited states in the sinh - gordon model .",

    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : shg ] we introduce the sinh - gordon model and discuss the initial state of interest in this work .",

    "the hamiltonian is left invariant by the following @xmath8 transformation [ eq : z2 ] t:(x)-(x ) .    in the infinite system",
    "the ( massive ) excitations above the vacuum state @xmath9 can be described in terms of the zamolodchikov - faddeev operators , denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "they obey the so called zamolodchikov - faddeev algebra , which in our case reads z(_1)z(_2)&=&s(_1-_2)z(_2)z(_1 ) [ zf_i ] , + z^(_1)z^(_2)&=&s(_1-_2)z^(_2)z^(_1 ) [ zf_ii ] , + z(_1)z^(_2)&=&s(_2-_1)z^(_2)z(_1)+2(_1-_2),[zf_iii ] where @xmath12 is the s - matrix of the sinh - gordon model s()=. [ s - matrix ]    a powerful method to analyse two dimensional integrable quantum field theories is provided by the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite , which we now briefly review within the sinh - gordon model .",
    "the starting point is the quantization of the theory on a finite ring of length @xmath13 .",

    "the latter is the distribution of unoccupied states and it is analogous to the well known distribution of holes in the fermi gas at finite temperature .",

    "as we briefly mentioned in the introduction , one of the main technical challenges in the application of the qam method consists in the specification of the initial state in the basis of the post - quench hamiltonian .",
    "this problem has been addressed mainly in non - relativistic models such as heisenberg spin chains @xcite and delta - interacting bose gases @xcite and it is even more challenging in the case of integrable quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ground state ( or vacuum state ) of the pre - quench hamiltonian typically does not have a well defined number of post - quench excitations and the relation between the zamolodchikov - faddeev operators corresponding to the theories before and after the quench in general is not known @xcite .    in this work we consider initial states of the form    arbitrary function and @xmath10",

    "this question is investigated in this section . in the following we refer to @xcite for a complete treatment of the mapping from the sinh - gordon field theory onto the lieb - liniger model , while here we only review the aspects that are relevant for our discussion .",

    "note that in the attractive case an analogous mapping exists from the sine - gordon field theory to the attractive lieb - liniger model @xcite .    in the repulsive regime , the lieb - liniger model does not exhibit bound states .",
    "the excitation spectrum can then be understood in terms of a single particle species as in the sinh - gordon field theory and the two - body scattering matrix is given by s_ll()=. [ ll_s - matrix ] the tba description is very similar to the case of the sinh - gordon model . in particular",

    "ll():=(-is_ll())=. [ eq : varphi1ll ] note that the form of eq .",
    "is analogous to that of eq . .",

    "we have verified that the predictions for the local observables match the ones obtained using the gge involving the conserved rapidity occupation numbers , in agreement with the results of refs .",
    "we have considered the computation of one - point correlation functions on the post - quench stationary state , for which we have proposed a formula based on the recent finite temperature results of refs .",

    "<S> we also provide exact results for the expectation values of arbitrary vertex operators in the post - quench stationary state by proposing a formula based on the analogy with the standard thermodynamic bethe ansatz . finally , we comment on the behavior of the post - quench stationary state under the mapping between the sinh - gordon field theory and the one - dimensional lieb - liniger model . </S>"
