    "anderson localization is the absence of diffusive wave transport in highly disordered scattering media  @xcite .",
    "it was first introduced in a pioneering theoretical study in 1958 by philip warren anderson  @xcite , who investigated the behavior of spin diffusion and electronic conduction in random lattices .",
    "it took more than ten years for the scientific community to recognize the importance of anderson s work .",
    "however , it has remained at the forefront of physics research since 1968 .",
    "there are still many uncertainties and unanswered questions in the linear and nonlinear behavior of disordered systems in various dimensions .",
    "the model that anderson studied involved an electron on a potential lattice with a random spread in the energies of the sites caused by a source of disorder .",
    "the electron was allowed to hop between sites via nearest neighbor potential coupling terms .",
    "anderson showed that the wavefunction of electron localizes to only few sites at all times , provided that the amount of randomness is sufficiently large .",
    "it did not take long for anderson and others to realize that the novel localization phenomenon was due to the wave nature of the quantum mechanical electrons scattering in a disordered potential , and that similar behavior should also be observed in other coherent wave systems , including classical ones  @xcite .",
    "the disorder - induced localization in electronic systems was shown to be inhibited by thermal fluctuations and nonlinear effects ; therefore , it was encouraging to find other avenues in which the disorder - induced anderson localization could be observed .",
    "subsequently , localization was studied in various classical wave systems including acoustics , elastics , electromagnetics , optics  @xcite , and various quantum optical systems , such as atomic lattices  @xcite and propagating photons  @xcite .",
    "optical systems have played a unique role in the fundamental understanding and experimental observation of anderson localization .",
    "optical phenomena are easy to `` visualize , '' and there are many advanced tools and techniques in optics that can be used to study the physics of localization .",
    "optical studies of anderson localization can often be done with tools that are widely accessible and can be performed in a single laboratory .",
    "in addition , anderson localization already has device - level applications in the optics  @xcite , and optics can `` illuminate '' the path to localization - based devices in other disordered classical and quantum wave systems .",
    "it has been shown that coherent waves in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and and two - dimensional ( 2d ) unbounded disordered systems are always localized  @xcite . for",
    "bounded 1d and 2d systems , if the sample size is considerably larger than the localization radius , the boundary effects are minimal and can often be ignored  @xcite . however , in three - dimensional ( 3d ) coherent wave systems , the scattering strength needs to be larger than a threshold value for the localization to happen  @xcite .",
    "the scattering strength is characterized by the wave scattering transport length @xmath0 ( shorter @xmath0 means stronger scattering ) , and the ioffe - regel condition  @xcite states that in order to observe anderson localization , the disorder must be strong enough that the wave scattering transport length becomes on the order of the wavelength .",
    "the ioffe - regel condition is often cast in the form of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the effective wavevector in the medium .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to satisfy in 3d disordered - media .",
    "for example , for the optical field to localize in 3d , very large refractive index contrasts are required that are not generally available in low - loss optical materials  @xcite .  _ the fact that anderson localization is hard to achieve in 3d optical systems may be a blessing in disguise ; otherwise , no sunlight would reach the earth on highly cloudy  days  _",
    "@xcite . in order to observe anderson localization of light , strongly scattering materials at optical and near infrared frequencies such as tio@xmath3 , gaas , gap , si , and ge nanoparticles can be used .",
    "careful measurements are required because bulk absorption can easily lead to experimental signatures similar to anderson localization @xcite .    unlike 3d lightwave systems , in which observation of localization is prohibitively difficult , observation of anderson localization in quasi-2d and -1d optical systems ( transverse anderson localization )",
    "is readily possible , as was first shown by abdullaev _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and de  raedt _ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "there have since been many reports on the observation of transverse anderson localization of light in 1d and 2d , which is the main focus of this tutorial review , as well .",
    "transverse anderson localization is attractive because of its relative simplicity , ease of experimentation , and the rewarding physical insights it brings about on many fronts .",
    "moreover , the longitudinal coordinate along the direction of propagation plays the role of time in a 2d disordered system ; therefore , controlled temporal variations can also be studied in these systems .",
    "there are many excellent reviews that cover various aspects of wave propagation in disordered systems as well as anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "this tutorial review is neither intended to be comprehensive , nor is it intended to explore each area it covers in great depth .",
    "rather , the intent is to provide a pedestrian and intuitive approach to anderson localization , mainly focused on the transverse localization of light . the coverage of topics is inevitably slanted toward those of particular interest to the author .",
    "the pedagogical approach is intended to benefit both newcomers to this rewarding research field , as well as outsiders who are interested to learn about anderson localization .",
    "the author seeks forgiveness from those whose work is not mentioned here , as well as for any technical errors or omissions .",
    "a good way to build an intuition about the relationship between randomness and localization is to use random matrices  @xcite .",
    "the following example shows that the extended eigenvectors of an ordered matrix become very localized when some randomness is added to the elements of a matrix .    consider a symmetric tridiagonal @xmath4 matrix @xmath5 defined as @xmath6 for all possible values of @xmath7 .",
    "for definiteness in this numerical example , we consider @xmath8 .",
    "matrix @xmath5 has @xmath9 real eigenvectors , and each eigenvector is an @xmath9-element vector .",

    "defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : defmorederd ] are extended over the entire element - position domain .",
    "eigenvectors @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are plotted in ( a ) ; and @xmath15 is plotted in ( b ) as a function of the element position @xmath12 .",
    ", width=480 ]    in figure  [ fig : orderedmatrix1 ] , a few eigenvectors @xmath11 are plotted as a function of their element number @xmath12 . in figure",
    "[ fig : orderedmatrix1](a ) , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are plotted and are all oscillatory functions of @xmath12 , where the @xmath7th eigenvector is identified by @xmath16 oscillation nodes .",
    "@xmath15 is also plotted in figure  [ fig : orderedmatrix1](b ) .",
    "the relevant observation here is that all of these eigenvectors are extended over the entire element - position domain .",
    "we now would like to show that randomness can localize the eigenvectors of @xmath5 over the element - position domain .",
    "for this part , lets preserve the tridiagonal character of @xmath5 as presented in eq .",
    "[ eq : defmorederd ] , but add a small random number to each off - diagonal element .",
    "the new , slightly randomized @xmath5 is formally defined as @xmath17 , \\label{eq : defmrandom1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a number randomly selected from a real uniform distribution in the range @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "similar to the case of the ordered @xmath5 in figure  [ fig : orderedmatrix1 ] , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are plotted in figure  [ fig : randommatrix1](a ) and @xmath15 is plotted in figure  [ fig : randommatrix1](b ) .",
    "this time , all of these eigenvectors appear to be localized over the element - position domain .    , except the matrix @xmath5 is * slightly * randomized according to eq .",
    "[ eq : defmrandom1 ] and the eigenvectors are localized.,width=480 ]    not only does the randomness result in localized eigenvectors , but also the relative strength of randomness compared with the average off - diagonal values determines the size of the localization ( localization length ) .",
    "this can be verified by increasing the range of the random numbers @xmath18 to @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the new , strongly randomized @xmath5 is formally defined as @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{eq : defmrandom2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , the same eigenvectors are plotted in figures  [ fig : randommatrix2](a ) and  [ fig : randommatrix2](b ) .",
    "the eigenvectors are strongly localized over the element - position domain because of the strong randomness in the off - diagonal elements of @xmath5 .     and figure  [ fig : randommatrix1 ] , except the matrix @xmath5 is * strongly * randomized according to eq .",
    "[ eq : defmrandom2 ] and the eigenvectors are * strongly * localized.,width=480 ]    the impact of disorder on the distribution of the width of the eigenvectors on the element - position domain can be easily visualized in a histogram . in figure",
    "[ fig : histogramrandommatrix ] , the distribution of the width of the eigenvectors is plotted for the weak disorder of eq .",
    "[ eq : defmrandom1 ] and the strong disorder of eq .",
    "[ eq : defmrandom2 ] .",
    "the width is calculated using the second moment method , which is the standard deviation around the mean position calculated using the absolute - value - squared of the eigenvectors .",
    "the width @xmath22 for the eigenvector @xmath10 is given by @xmath23 each probability distribution is presented in a histogram and is the result of averaging over 100 independent random simulations . from the distributions in figure",
    "[ fig : histogramrandommatrix ] , it is clear that stronger disorder results in stronger localization of the eigenvectors ; moreover , it is clear that such statements can only be made in a statistical sense .",
    "therefore , in the case of strong disorder , although the majority of the eigenvectors are more localized , a minority of the eigenvectors may actually be less localized than those of the weak disorder .",
    ", and the strong disorder related to eq .",
    "[ eq : defmrandom2 ] . ]",
    "the exercise presented here shows how off - diagonal disorder results in localization .",
    "similar localization behavior can be observed for diagonal disorder , where only the diagonal elements of @xmath5 are randomized , and also for mixed diagonal and off - diagonal disorder .",
    "* highlights : *    * the eigenvectors of random matrices can be localized in the element position space . *",
    "some modes are very narrow and some are wide , and localization is only meaningful in a statistical sense . * by calculating the width of the eigenvectors of a large ensemble of random matrices , it is possible to calculate the probability distribution for the width of the eigenvectors . * a stronger level of randomness shifts the eigenvector - width probability distribution to smaller width values , hence a stronger localization .",
    "another interesting example that links randomness to localization is the problem of light transmission through a random stack of dielectrics . the normalized transmission through a stack of dielectrics is shown in figure  [ fig:1d - stack ] . the light , which is incident from the left , is partially reflected from the stack , while the rest is transmitted through the stack . the dielectrics are assumed to be lossless .     and @xmath24 is shown , ( b ) is similar , except the thickness of the layers is chosen randomly.,width=432 ]    figure  [ fig:1d - stack](a ) shows a periodic array of two different dielectric materials identified with refractive indexes @xmath25 and @xmath24 , more commonly referred to as a bragg grating .",

    "the thickness of each layer is @xmath26 ( identical for all layers ) , and @xmath27 is the wavevector , where @xmath28 is the optical wavelength in vacuum .",
    "the stack is made of 200 air - glass layers ( 400 layers total ) , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is assumed .",
    "the usual bandgaps and bandpasses are observed in the transmission plot of this periodic bragg grating .",
    "the setup for figure  [ fig:1d - pc](b ) is identical to that of figure  [ fig:1d - pc](a ) , except the thickness of each layer is chosen from a uniform random distribution in the range @xmath31 $ ] . unlike the periodic bragg grating , transmission through the random stack",
    "is nearly zero except for very small values of the normalized frequency @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the random stack behaves like a nearly perfect mirror beyond a certain frequency .     for ( a ) a periodic layer thickness and ( b ) random layer thickness .",

    "[ eq : mmatrix ] related to figure  [ fig : m - matrix ] : @xmath34 ( n_2-n_1)e^{-i\\varphi } & ( n_2+n_1)e^{-i\\varphi } \\end{bmatrix } , \\quad \\varphi = n_1k_0d .",

    "@xcite .    , except with 10,000 layers.,width=460 ]    it is instructive to repeat the exercise of figure  [ fig:1d - pc ] with a larger number of layers .",
    "in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000 ] , the number of layers is increased to 10,000 in each case , and the relative optical power transmission is plotted in db units . the logarithmic scaling on the vertical axis shows that the bandgap frequency ranges in the ordered stack of figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000](a ) , although not perfect due to the finite number of layers , attenuate the transmitted light by more than 20,000  db , making the stack a nearly perfect mirror over this frequency range .",
    "the random stack in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000](b ) , except for low frequency values , is also a very good reflector .",
    "although the attenuation in transmission at 3,000  db or more is not as good as the bandgap region in the periodic case , it is very broadband and is not limited to bandgap range .",
    "the observations in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000 ] bring about a somewhat philosophical issue . in practice ,",
    "any stack of optical dielectrics has some inevitable randomness ; therefore , given a sufficiently large number of layers , it acts as a perfect mirror beyond a certain frequency .",
    "of course , at very low frequencies , the wavelength is so large that it hops over the stack and results in large transmission .",
    "therefore , in practice , any stack of optical dielectrics with a sufficiently large number of layers is a practically a broadband bandgap structure .",
    "the periodic structure analyzed in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000](a ) can be viewed as the limiting case of the random structure , when the randomness goes to zero .",
    "when this limit is taken , the bandpasses emerge out of the broadband bandgap of the more general disordered stack . therefore , the philosophical point of view is that the magic of a periodic structure is not in its bandgap , because the bandgap comes naturally in any practical 1d stack ; rather , it is the emergence of the bandpasses that makes periodic structure so special . while this may seem like an inconsequential philosophical issue , it is necessary to alert students who learn about coherent waves in periodic systems in optics or condensed matter physics to ensure that they develop proper early intuition about the true implications of periodicity . _",
    "the bandpasses are at least as glorious as the bandgaps_.    the low - frequency behavior , as well as the periodic `` very weak '' resurrection of transmission in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000](b ) , can be intuitively understood based on the work of berry _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the optical transmission through a random stack of @xmath9 bi - layered transparent plates , each contributing a random phase @xmath36 belonging to a uniform distribution @xmath37 $ ] , is given by @xmath38 using @xmath39 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , one obtains @xmath40 , which is in agreement with the numerical simulation in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000](b ) . in the simulations presented in figures  [ fig:1d - pc ]  and  [ fig:1d - pc-10000 ] , it was assumed that @xmath41 $ ] ; therefore , @xmath42 in order to obtain the near uniform distribution of @xmath37 $ ] , the upper bound in eq .",
    "[ eq : berry2 ] can be set to @xmath43 , where one obtains @xmath44 as the condition for the disorder - induced localization , exerting its full power and agreeing with the assumptions of ref .",
    "it should be noted that this value is very close to the value of @xmath32 in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000](b ) , beyond which the attenuation is strong .",
    "therefore , the main reason that the attenuation is not strong at low @xmath32 is that the random phase @xmath36 does not cover the entire range of @xmath45 $ ] . for @xmath46 , although the range of the phase @xmath36 covers the entire @xmath45 $ ] , it partially folds over and makes the distribution of @xmath36 non - uniform over @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "for example , consider the case of @xmath47 $ ] .",

    "this is the main reason behind the partial resurrections of transmission observed in figure  [ fig:1d - pc-10000](b ) for @xmath46 .",
    "a final and important point is that the exponential decay of the optical amplitude in the disordered stack is a manifestation of the `` coherent '' superposition of partial waves that reflect and transmit at each boundary .",
    "the fact that the naive ray theory , which is based on incoherent transmissions and reflections , fails to predict the anderson localization behavior observed in these examples= defies the intuition at first glance .",
    "the interested reader can consult ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion on these points .",
    "a simple and elegant experiment using a laser pointer and a stack of overhead transparencies is also presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be excellent demonstration in an undergraduate laboratory in optics .    *",
    "highlights : *    * optical transmission through a stack of dielectric layers with differing refractive indexes and random thicknesses drops , on the average , exponentially with the number of layers . * this exponential drop is observed for all wavelengths that are comparable or shorter than the mean thickness of the dielectric layers .",
    "the random stack behaves like an ultra - broadband mirror . *",
    "the optimum localization is obtained when the cumulative optical phase in each layer is from a uniformly distributed random number in the range @xmath45 $ ] .",

    "as we will see later in image transport applications of this disordered optical fiber , a small beam localization radius is likely its main desired attribute .",
    "a reduced variance is also desired , because as a device it is not helpful to have variations in the beam radius that depend on the transverse location of the beam in a random and unpredictable way .",
    "in other words , although the underlying waveguiding mechanism is based on disorder and randomness , the main measurable device attribute , the localized beam radius , should be predictable .",
    "these considerations lead one to ask what can be done , in the design of these disordered fiber in order to minimize the localization radius and also reduce the sample - to - sample variations in the localization radius .",
    "the localized beam radius can depend on : the input characteristics of the optical beam such as the wavelength and the in - coupling beam diameter ; the dimensionful fiber characteristics such as the transverse dimensions of the fiber , the width of each pixel ; and the dimensionless fiber characteristics such as the refractive index of the components , especially the index difference , and the geometrical ratio of the components used in the fiber characterized by the fill - fraction .",
    "given the intuition we established based on the modal picture , we learned that if the initial excitation width is smaller than the radius of a typical mode of the disordered waveguide ( localization radius or localization length ) , the propagating light eventually localizes to a radius that is comparable to the localization length ; and if the initial excitation is wider than the typical width of an individual mode , the propagating light eventually localizes to a slightly wider beam than the original size .",
    "therefore , the design program to optimize the disordered waveguide for best localization must be independent of the input beam profile and must focus on the transverse dimensions of the localized beams  @xcite .",
    "another important property of the disordered fiber is the transverse size of the fiber .",
    "if the fiber cross section is not large enough , the boundaries of the fiber strongly affect the localization radius of the modes .",
    "the impact of the boundary on the localization radius of the modes that reside near the boundary is inevitable , but in an ideal case the fiber cross section must be large enough so that the modes in the interior region are shielded from the boundary to prevent excessive scattering loss ; therefore , the physical characteristics of the majority or nearly all of the interior modes are solely determined by the transverse anderson localization mechanism .    in the ideal case ,",
    "when the disordered fiber cross section is much larger than the light wavelength , feature size ( width of each index pixel ) , and the localization radius of the typical modes , the total transverse size of the fiber becomes irrelevant . in that case , the only two dimensionful fiber design parameters are the light wavelength and the width of each pixel .",
    "considering the fact that maxwell s equations are scale invariant , if the wavelength and feature size ( fluctuating index pixel size ) are scaled by some factor , the localized beam radius of each mode is scaled by the same factor .",
    "the feature size of the palof studied in refs .",
    "@xcite are approximately 0.9  m. experimental measurements and numerical simulations have confirmed that the localization radius is much smaller at 405  nm wavelength than at 633  nm wavelength , as shown in figure  [ fig : w633nmvs405 ] .",
    "it is speculated that the optimum feature size for strong localization using the rlv scheme is around @xmath168 .",
    "this statement is merely an educated guess and the optimum value of the feature size relative to the wavelength has yet to be found .",
    "intuitively , if the feature size is too small compared with the wavelength , the optical field would hop over the random sites and merely average the refractive index , with very weak scattering .",
    "on the other hand , if the feature size is too large compared with the wavelength , the mean free path for wave scattering will be large , resulting in a large localization radius .",
    "therefore , there must be an optimum value of the feature size for a given wavelength .",
    "finding the optimum value is computationally very challenging .",
    "another design parameter that affects the localized beam radius in the binary disordered rlv scheme is the portion of each random refractive index component , characterized by the fill - fraction @xmath169 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath169 is defined as the portion of the low - index material in the higher index host medium .",

    "adapted with permission , copyright 2012 , optical society of america  @xcite.,width=240 ]    the last , but definitely not the least important design parameter to reduce the localization radius is the index difference between the random components of the disordered fiber .",
    "it is generally believed that a stronger localization ( smaller average mode radius ) is obtained if the refractive index difference between the random constituents is increased .",
    "this is confirmed in the 1d model of the transverse anderson localization of ref .",
    "however , it is also shown that the dependence of the average mode radius on the index difference asymptotically saturates beyond a certain value of the index difference ; therefore , the payback in the reduction of the localization length may be quite small beyond a certain threshold index difference . while these issues are well studied in the 1d model of ref .",

    "both density and 3d plots are presented in each case for easier comparison.,title=\"fig:\",width=432 ]    in figure  [ fig : g2-neighbor - waveguide - with - disorder ] we present plots of the same scenario of figure  [ fig : g2-more - separation - no - disorder](a ) , except in the presence of disorder , averaged over 1000 independent simulations .",

    "we note that increasing the level of disorder compared with the disorder - free case in figure  [ fig : g2-more - separation - no - disorder](a ) decreases the probability of ballistic co - propagation of photons to the same edge , while increasing the probability of the localization of both photons in the center waveguide .",
    "therefore , the disorder - free case of figure  [ fig : g2-more - separation - no - disorder](a ) favors _ both freely propagating to the same edge _ to _ one localized and one freely propagating _ to _ both localized _ , respectively , and the presence of disorder reverses this behavior .    we encourage the interested reader to consult ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed account of the behavior of @xmath269 , upon which much of the preceding discussion is based .",
    "the above discussion only covers the case of off - diagonal disorder in a disordered coupled array waveguide .",
    "the comparison with the case of the diagonal disorder is performed in ref .",
    "it is shown that the evolution and localization of the photon density ( optical intensity ) is similar in the two cases of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder , as expected .",
    "however , the intensity correlation ( photon density - density correlation or @xmath269 ) carries a distinct signature of the type of disorder .",
    "the propagation of an entangled - photon pairs in a disordered waveguide array has also been explored in ref .",
    "it has been shown that while neither photon is localized , the two - photon separation in coincidence space is : this behavior is called anderson colocalization .",
    "the increase in entanglement is accompanied by a gradual evolution from anderson - localization to anderson colocalization .",
    "* highlights : *    * if all the eigenmodes of a disordered waveguide are exponentially localized , any partially incoherent beam exhibits localization with exponentially decaying tails , after a sufficiently long propagation distances .",
    "* the more incoherent the in - coupling beam is , the longer it diffusively spreads while propagating in the medium . therefore , localization is delayed by incoherence compared with the case of a coherent in - coupling beam . *",
    "the observed localization behavior in a disordered waveguide is affected by the quantum statistics of the in - coupling photons .",
    "the effect can be mainly observed in the second - order quantum coherence function , which gives us information about two photon correlations .",

    "in addition to the intriguing fundamental science behind anderson localization , there are potential applications for light interaction with disordered dielectric systems .",

    "there are still plenty of open questions in both linear and nonlinear dynamics of disordered systems that have yet to be answered .",
    "there has been a recent surge of interest among the optics community in anderson localization , and it would have been impossible to cover them all even briefly in this survey .",
