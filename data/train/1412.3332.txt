    "at the early epoch of the universe ( @xmath0 1100 ) , proton couples with free electron , which is called `` recombination '' and neutral hydrogen is formed .",
    "after recombination , the universe keeps neutral state until first object is formed .",
    "we call this epoch `` dark age '' .",
    "as the universe is evolved , matter fluctuations grow gravitationally and dark matter is collapsed at over - dense region .",
    "gravitational potential by collapsed objects attracts baryonic objects around dark matter halos and these baryonic objects form primordial stars @xcite . as a result of the formation of first stars , the period called `` cosmic dawn '' in which astrophysical processes play an important",
    "role begins .",
    "after the first objects are formed , the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen couples to the color temperature of lyman alpha ( ly-@xmath1 ) radiation emitted from the first objects .",
    "this effect is called `` wouthuysen field ( wf ) effect''@xcite .",
    "typically , ly-@xmath1 radiation field temperature is nearly equal to the kinetic temperature of intergalactic medium ( igm ) because ly-@xmath1 scattering rate is very large and the frequent scattering leads to a large number of ly-@xmath1 photons which brings ly-@xmath1 radiation field coupling to the gas which property is determined by the kinetic temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spin temperature comes to couple to the kinetic temperature . after the wf effect becomes effective , next astrophysical process which affects the thermal history of igm is x - ray heating @xcite .",
    "it is expected that cold igm is heated due to the x - ray photons emitted from x - ray binaries @xcite and gas kinetic temperature increases dramatically @xcite .",
    "as the heating of igm progresses , thermal phase of igm is changed and neutral hydrogen starts to be ionized by uv radiation from early galaxies @xcite . this epoch is called `` epoch of reionization ( eor ) '' @xcite .",
    "the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen is sensitive to the thermal and ionized states of gas as well as the first objects in the early universe and it has been expected to give us valuable information about the thermal history of intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "one of the statistical methods to probe the igm state is the power spectrum of brightness temperature ( 21 cm power spectrum ) @xcite .",
    "brightness temperature is a fundamental quantity of the 21 cm signal , which is the spin temperature offsetting from the cmb temperature @xmath2 along the line of sight ( los ) at observed frequency @xmath3 .",
    "this can be written as @xcite @xmath4 .",

    "all quantities are evaluated at redshift @xmath13 .",
    "on - going radio interferometers such as murchison wide field array @xcite , low frequency array @xcite and probing the epoch of reionization @xcite have been operated as the  prototype \" of future high - sensitivity experiments .",
    "although the sensitivities of the on - going experiments are not enough to obtain the images of the redshifted 21 cm line from the early universe , the power spectrum of the 21 cm signal would be detected @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is expected that the 21 cm power spectrum for each redshift ( @xmath14 ) can be measured by square kilometre array with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous works about the 21 cm power spectrum in both theoretical and observational aspects @xcite . in particular ,",
    "most of such works have focused on the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) at @xmath15 . in this epoch",
    ", the 21 cm power spectrum is expected to trace the spatial distribution of the neutral fraction of gas @xmath9 and we can ignore the fluctuation of the spin temperature because @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the 21 cm signal from @xmath17 , at when in the universe the first astrophysical objects have started to be formed , has not been investigated deeply  @xcite .",
    "this epoch is called as  cosmic dawn \" and it should be also important to investigate the 21 cm signal from the igm at this epoch because the state of igm at this epoch has to be crucial for the formation of the first astrophysical objects . at this epoch ,",
    "since the reionization process has not proceeded sufficiently , the neutral fraction of gas @xmath9 should be almost unity and the spatial distribution of the brightness temperature does not trace that of the neutral fraction . instead of this , the 21 cm power spectrum from this epoch should have the information about not only the matter density field but also the spin temperature related with the state of igm .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the 21 cm signal from the epoch of  cosmic dawn \" , that is @xmath18 , and investigate what we can learn from the signal by using a public code called 21cmfast @xcite .",
    "this code is based on a semi - analytic model of star / galaxy formation and reionization .",
    "first , in order to find how physical processes are related to the observed 21 cm signal at @xmath18 , we decompose the 21 cm power spectrum into three components composed by fluctuations of the matter density field , those of the neutral fraction and those of the spin temperature , and discuss the redshift evolution of the power spectrum .    next , we further focus on the distributions , variances and skewnesses of the brightness temperature and three decomposed components , in order to understand the physical meaning of the behavior of the 21 cm power spectrum more deeply .",
    "although there are several studies which discuss the one - point statistics of the brightness temperature @xcite , most of such works have focused on the signal from eor , that is , @xmath19 , to investigate its dependence on the reionization process , and for the signal from @xmath18 the one - point statistics are not sufficiently discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", first we show the 21 cm power spectrum and the decomposition of it into each component and discuss the redshift dependence of the power spectrum .",
    "in section 3 , we investigate distribution and one - point statistics such as variance and skewness of the spin temperature which is a dominant component of the 21 cm power spectrum at higher redshift ( @xmath18 ) , and also we investigate its dependence on the x - ray heating efficiency . in section 4 , based on the discussion about the one - point statistics of the spin temperature given in section 3 , we investigate the one - point statistics of observed brightness temperature . in section 5 , we give a summary and conclusion .    unless stated otherwise , we quote all quantities in comoving units . we employ the best fit values of the standard cosmological parameters obtained in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we calculate the 21 cm power spectrum and its decomposition into spectra of the matter density field , the neutral fraction and the spin temperature . in particular , we focus on the redshift evolution of the power spectra .",
    "first , we define the power spectrum of brightness temperature as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the mean brightness temperature obtained from brightness temperature map . as we saw in eq.([eq : brightness ] ) , the fluctuation of brightness temperature is contributed from those in the matter density , spin temperature , neutral fraction and peculiar velocity . here",
    "we define @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are volume average of @xmath29 and the power spectra of @xmath30 and @xmath24 as , @xmath31 here , we introduce a new parameter @xmath32 in order to describe the fluctuation of the spin temperature @xmath5 . by making use of this parameter , the brightness temperature can be related with the contribution of the spin temperature linearly . in the case where the fluctuation of the spin temperature @xmath33 is small , @xmath24 and @xmath34",
    "are related as    @xmath35    the cross correlations such as @xmath36 are defined in a similar way . then , from eq.([eq : brightness ] ) , we see that the power spectrum of brightness temperature can be decomposed into a sum of the auto - correlations and cross - correlations : @xmath37 , \\label{eq : ps_higher}\\ ] ] where , @xmath38^{1/2 } ( 0.15/\\omega_m h^2)^{1/2 } ( \\omega_b h^2/0.023 ) \\nonumber.\\ ] ] we neglected higher - order terms and we have checked that the higher - order contributions are at most @xmath39 of the total power spectrum at higher redshifts we are interested in here , and do not affect the qualitative feature of the redshift evolution . therefore , the contribution can be safely neglected for the purpose of this article",
    ". however , for more precise quantitative discussion , such higher - order contributions have to be evaluated precisely .",
    "we plan to investigate the higher - order contribution and non - linearity in the future .",
    "to compute the power spectra , we use a public code called 21cmfast @xcite .",
    "this code is based on a semi - analytic model of star / galaxy formation and reionization , and outputs maps of matter density , velocity , spin temperature , ionized fraction and brightness temperature at the designated redshifts .",
    "we performed simulations in a @xmath40 comoving box with @xmath41 grids , which corresponds to 0.66 mpc resolution or @xmath42 3 arcmin at 80 mhz ( @xmath43=17 ) ( we show some telescope specifications in table.[tb : spec ] ) , from @xmath44 to @xmath45 adopting the following parameter set , @xmath46 .",
    "here , @xmath47 is the ionizing efficiency , @xmath48 is the number of x - ray photons emitted by source per solar mass , @xmath49 is the minimum virial temperature of halos which produce ionizing photons , and @xmath50 is the mean free path of ionizing photons through the igm . in our calculation , we also ignore , for simplicity , the gradient of peculiar velocity whose contribution to the brightness temperature is relatively small ( a few % ) @xcite .",
    "[ tb : spec ]     ( left  top ) , @xmath51 ( right  top ) and @xmath52 ( left  bottom ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_z ] , we plot the total and decomposed power spectra , @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath32 , as functions of redshift for @xmath55 .",
    "we can see several characteristic peaks in the total power spectrum : three peaks for @xmath56 and two peaks for @xmath57 .",
    "these were already found in the previous works and it was suggested that they are , from high - z one to low - z one , induced by the wf effect , x - ray heating and reionization , respectively @xcite . below we give a more detailed interpretation considering contributions from the fluctuations in neutral fraction , matter density and spin temperature .",
    "first , the fluctuation in neutral fraction appears when reionization begins but power spectrum , @xmath58 , is subdominant at high redshifts ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "it becomes dominant as reionization proceeds and forms the low - z peak at @xmath59 .",
    "a dip at @xmath60 corresponds to the redshift when the average spin temperature becomes equal to the cmb temperature so that the average brightness temperature , @xmath61 , vanishes .",
    "this dip is also seen in the contribution of matter fluctuations , which is important at smaller scales .    on the other hand ,",
    "the power spectrum contributed from the spin - temperature fluctuations is negligible at low redshifts ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is because at these redshifts the spin temperature is much higher than the cmb temperature and the factor @xmath62 is almost unity independent of the value of @xmath63 .",
    "the spin - temperature fluctuations are important at higher redshifts ( @xmath64 ) especially at larger scales and this contribution forms the two peaks at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , there are slight deviations in the peak positions between the brightness temperature and spin temperature due to the presence of matter fluctuations .",
    "thus , the low - z peak and the other two peaks are contributed from the neutral fraction and spin temperature fluctuations , respectively , while the high - z peak at small scales can not be seen due to the contribution from matter fluctuations . in other words , the evolution of spin temperature , which reflects the formation rate and properties of the first - generation stars , can be directly probed by measuring the power spectrum of brightness temperature at @xmath18 . in the next section ,",
    "we focus on the understanding of spin - temperature fluctuations at this epoch considering one - point statistics .",
    "in this section , we study the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of spin temperature and one - point statistics such as variance and skewness . in practice , we focus on @xmath67 , rather than @xmath63 itself , because it is linearly related to the brightness temperature . however , because @xmath32 is a monotonic function of @xmath63 , physical interpretation is relatively straightforward . recently",
    ", one - point statistics of brightness temperature during reionization was investigated assuming @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this condition is not valid in our context .",

    "[ fig : ts_map ] . from these maps ,",
    "we evaluate the pdf and also the variance and skewness of @xmath32 .",
    "the variance and skewness of a variable @xmath71 are defined as , @xmath72 ^ 2 \\label{eq : variance } \\\\ & & \\gamma = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma^3 } \\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\big [ x - \\overline{x } \\big]^3 , \\label{eq : skewness}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the number of pixels of the maps .",

    "green dashed line corresponds to @xmath81 . ]",
    "we plot the pdf of @xmath32 for @xmath74 in fig.[fig : ts_tcmb_compare2 ] .",
    "first of all , the average value of @xmath32 decreases as redshift decreases because the spin temperature strongly couples to the kinetic temperature , which decreases as @xmath82 due to the adiabatic cooling of gas , via the wf effect at this epoch .",
    "next , we see the shape of the pdf is also changing and , in particular , the direction of the longer tail changes at @xmath83 ( cyan dot - dashed line ) .",
    "this is also confirmed in the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : variance_skewness_ts_tcmb ] , where we plot the time evolution of the variance and skewness of the pdf . actually , the sign of the skewness changes at the same redshift from negative to positive . here",
    "it is important to note that the variance has a local minimum at almost the same timing .",
    "because the variance is the integration of the power spectrum with respect to the wavenumber , this local minimum corresponds to the dip in the contribution of @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_z ] .    the above behavior can be understood by considering the x - ray heating of the gas . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts_map ] , at higher redshifts ( @xmath84 ) the spin temperature in the neighborhood of stars approaches to the kinetic temperature due to the wf effect and becomes lower than the average , and consequently its pdf has a tail toward lower temperature .",
    "then , as x - ray heating becomes effective , the spin temperature increases in the neighborhood of stars and the tail goes toward higher - value side . at the transition time",
    ", the tail becomes shortest and consequently the variance has a local minimum there .",
    "the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : variance_skewness_ts_tcmb ] , the cross correlation between the matter and spin temperature fluctuations , strongly supports the above interpretation .",
    "here we evaluate the cross correlation from the cross power spectrum as @xmath85 at higher redshifts ( @xmath86 ) , the correlation is negative , that is , high - density regions have lower spin temperature .",
    "this would be due to the wf effect .",
    "on the other hand , at lower redshifts ( @xmath87 ) , as is expected from the interpretation that x - ray heating is effective here , the correlation is positive .",
    "it is seen that the cross correlation changes the sign at the same redshift as the skewness .",
    "finally , we vary the number of x - ray photons emitted per solar mass , @xmath88 @xcite , and see the one - point statistics again .",
    "we take @xmath89 ( fiducial value ) , and @xmath90 , fixing the other parameters . the left top of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] is the thermal history and we see that the spin temperature rises earlier for larger @xmath88 .",

    "this is the expected behavior from our interpretation given in the previous section because x - ray heating will become effective earlier for larger @xmath88 .",
    "the power spectra of the brightness temperature contributed from the fluctuations in @xmath32 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_ts_comp ] and , as expected again , the dip appears earlier for larger @xmath88 .",
    "spin temperature evolution for @xmath91 ( red ) , @xmath92 ( green ) and @xmath93 ( blue ) .",
    "we also plot kinetic temperature in the absence of x - ray heating ( pink ) and in the presence of x - ray heating with @xmath94 ( light blue ) and cmb temperature ( black ) .",

    "the transition occurs at @xmath83 for a fiducial set of model parameters and this depends on the effectiveness of x - ray heating .",
    "conversely , our interpretation implies that , if we detect a dip in the redshift dependence of the power spectrum at the relatively higher redshift , we could know the redshift when x - ray begins to become effective . further , when we detect a peak , it would be possible to know whether x - ray heating is effective at the redshift from the skewness . however , although the spin - temperature fluctuations are dominant at large scales , the contribution from matter fluctuations is not negligible and change the critical redshift as we see in the next section .    here , it is important to note the difference between the redshift of the local minimum of the average spin temperature and the above critical redshift .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that the average spin temperature is a global property of the intergalactic gas while the skewness is largely affected by the behavior of a small fraction of gas near stars .",
    "thus , the latter is more sensitive to the onset of x - ray heating .",
    "if so , it is expected that the difference in the two redshifts depends on the spectrum of x - ray @xcite .",
    "for example , if the x - ray spectrum is hard , the difference will become smaller because higher - energy x - rays have larger mean free path so that they tend to heat larger region around the source .",
    "in this section , we focus on the one point statistics of the brightness temperature .",

    "\\label{eq : skewness_dt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , we notice that @xmath100 is slightly different from the average @xmath101 obtained from brightness temperature map due to the contribution of higher - order terms .",
    "although we focus on relatively high redshift , we find that @xmath102 is important when we consider the skewness .    in fig.[fig :",

    "[ fig : skewness_dt2 ] , the change of sign in skewness for the brightness temperature is deviated from the one of @xmath32 due to the contribution of matter fluctuations , which have always negative skewness .",

    "in this paper , we gave a physical interpretation of the evolution of the power spectrum of the 21 cm brightness temperature during the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization using a public code , 21cmfast .",
    "with a fixed wave number , the power spectrum has three peaks as a function of redshift .",
    "first , we decomposed the power spectrum into those contributed from the fluctuations in dark matter density , spin temperature and neutral fraction and found that the peak with the lowest redshift is mostly contributed from the neutral fraction , while the other two peaks are contributed from the dark matter density and spin temperature fluctuations .",
    "further , it was found that a dip between two peaks with higher redshifts is induced by the neutral fraction .",
    "then , to understand the physical meaning of the dip , we investigated the one - point function of the spin temperature distribution .",
    "we found that the redshift of the dip is critical in a sense that the skewness of the one - point function and the correlation coefficient between the spin temperature and dark matter distribution change their signs and that the variance also has a dip .",
    "from this fact , it was implied that the dip in the power spectrum of the brightness temperature contributed from the spin temperature is a signature of the onset of x - ray heating of the gas .",
    "this interpretation was justified by seeing the behavior when varying the model parameter corresponding to x - ray heating .    due to the contribution of dark matter density ,",
    "the redshift of the dip in the power spectrum contributed from the spin temperature is slightly different from that in the full power spectrum .",
    "however , the dip will still be a good indicator of the onset of x - ray heating .",
    "further , based on the cosmological perturbation theory , we can theoretically estimate the skewness of the brightness temperature contributed from the dark matter fluctuations in the standard cosmological model .",
    "therefore , in principle , we can subtract the dark matter contribution and directly measure the skewness of the contribution from the spin temperature .",
    "moreover , the scale dependence of the bispectrum , which has a close relation to the skewness , of the brightness temperature would help us to extract the information about the spin temperature from the observed brightness temperature .",
    "the bispectrum is also deeply related to the non - linear terms @xcite in the power spectrum which we neglected in this paper . because the fluctuations in the spin temperature are of order @xmath109 and are deviated from gaussian distribution , the non - linear terms are potentially important .",
    "in particular , we found that the linear and non - linear terms are comparable when we evaluate the skewness .",
    "further , the bispectrum and higher - order statistics would be very useful to extract physical information from 21 cm signal @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "these topics will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the detectability of variance and skewness was discussed in @xcite . following @xcite , the signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "s / n , of skewness can be roughly estimated by @xmath110where we have neglected the contribution from kurtosis . here , @xmath111 is the number of pixels and we set @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the instrumental noise on brightness temperature given by @xmath114where @xmath115 is the total effective area of array , @xmath116 is angular resolution , @xmath117 is frequency resolution and @xmath118 is observing time . considering the ska1 ( @xmath119 $ ] ) and ska2 ( @xmath120 $ ] ) with 1000 hours of observation time and @xmath121 , we obtain s / n = 6 and 18 at @xmath122 , and s / n = 2 and 8 at @xmath123 , for ska1 and ska2 , respectively .    finally , we would like to note that the variance and skewness are actually dependent on the angular resolution and survey area .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that they are expressed by the integration of power spectrum and bispectrum with respect to the wavenumber . in our calculation , we have fixed the box size and the number of grids in simulations to be @xmath124 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "this is corresponding to @xmath125 resolution or @xmath126 at @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) . in fig .",
