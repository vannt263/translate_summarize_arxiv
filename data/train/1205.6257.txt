    "in this paper we study mellin - barnes ( mb ) transform of three - point scalar ladder - like integrals in @xmath0 space - time dimensions .",
    "these integrals contribute to green s functions of four - dimensional massless scalar theories and can be represented in terms of ud functions @xcite . as has been proven in refs .",
    "@xcite at the level of graphs , the ud functions transform to themselves under fourier transform .",
    "also , this property can be proven by making a use of the mb transform @xcite .    as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , any other scalar three - point green s function even in the non - integer number @xmath8 of dimensions possesses such a property of invariance with respect to fourier transform too .",
    "this happens due to the fact that any three - point function can diagrammatically be considered as a net of consequent three - point or four - point integrations in the position space since any of those integrations in the position space can be represented in terms of mb integral transforms with powers of spacetime intervals in denominators depending on the mb transform parameters . doing consequently momentum integration via the mb transform , we come to an expression in which there is no momentum integral but there are integrations in complex planes of the mb transform parameters",
    ". we can apply arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite to the expressions of such a type in order to demonstrate their invariance with respect to the fourier transformation .    in general , technique of the mb transform is a powerful method to perform complicate multiloop calculations in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "for example , the three - point one - loop function in the position space in the massless scalar theory is a combination of appell s hypergeometric functions @xcite , which have appeared as a result of residue calculation via the mb transform . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that for the three - point integrations in the position space with the powers of space - time intervals in the denominators equal to the integer numbers shifted by some multipliers of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a parameter of dimensional regularization , @xmath11 these appell s hypergeometric functions can be reduced to a combination of the ud functions .",
    "on the other side , the four - point function in the position space in the scalar theory in @xmath0 dimensions can be represented in terms of the ud functions too @xcite .",
    "the invariance of those four - point ladder integrals under the fourier transform can be proved by means of the mb transform too @xcite .",
    "all these properties make ud functions very attractive for further investigation by making a use of the mb technique .",
    "the main advantage of this technique that we use in the present paper is that the three - point @xmath12-dimensional integration is transformed to a power - like form , which can be integrated in further loops as a three - point integration with the powers of space - time intervals in denominators which depend on the complex variables of the mb transform .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to investigate further the properties of the ud functions via the mb transform . as a by - product",
    ", we derive new formulas for the mb two - fold integration in the complex planes of two variables of integration .",
    "the third aim is to demonstrate compatibility between these formulas for the mb transform and the bethe - salpeter equation for the infinite sum of triangle - like and box - like scalar ladders .",
    "the fourth motivation for the investigation developed in this paper is to apply the experience obtained with studying the bethe - salpeter equation for the scalar ladders to calculation of an auxiliary vertex or green function , which in @xmath13 supersymmetric yang - mills theory does not depend on any scale , ultraviolet or infrared , in the limit of removing dimensional regularization , @xmath14 in @xmath15 that vertex should satisfy the bethe - salpeter equation , particular for this green s function .",
    "this is @xmath16 vertex in which an auxiliary field @xmath17 couples to two ( self - adjoint ) faddeev - popov ghost fields @xmath18 to investigate that vertex by the bethe - salpeter equation has a sense since the ghost fields are the only fields of this vertex which stand in the measure of the path integral , and therefore this equation restricts the vertex strongly .    as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , in @xmath13 supersymmetric yang - mills theory starting with this vertex all the other correlators can be found in the four - dimensional limit ( when @xmath0 ) by using slavnov - taylor identity @xcite .",
    "the explicit two - loop result for that vertex has been found in refs .",
    "all the poles in @xmath10 disappear in all number of loops for this vertex , however it can not be analysed by the methods of conformal field theory since the auxiliary field @xmath17 does not propagate . nevertheless , the three - point function of dressed mean gluons of refs .",
    "@xcite can be fixed by conformal symmetry in analogy to @xcite , however , we can not find higher - point correlators of the dressed mean fields from this green s function by using st identity .    as it can be seen from refs .",
    "@xcite , the explicit structure of @xmath16 correlator includes logarithms and the ud functions of ratios of spacetime distances between arguments of the green s functions .",
    "as it follows from ref.@xcite , the ladder - like diagrams with horizontal gluon lines , that are important subclass of all the diagrams contributing to that vertex can be represented in terms of the ud functions too for an arbitrary number of the horizontal gluon lines . in the next paper",
    "we will demonstrate that any of the contributions to the correlator can be represented in terms of the ud functions @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a particular solution to the bethe - salpeter equation , that represents an infinite sum of the triangle scalar ladder diagrams in four space - time dimensions in the mb representation .",
    "this particular solution has already been studied in the case of the box - ladder diagrams by broadhurst and davydychev in ref .",
    "the authors of @xcite calculated a sum of those box - ladder diagrams by making a use of the integral representation for the ud functions of ref .",
    "as has been shown in refs.@xcite , the triangle - like and the box - like ladders in four space - time dimensions are related by conformal transformation in dual space and their mb transforms coincide .",
    "the difference of the present paper with the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is that we do the calculation via the mb transformation .",
    "we derive recursive relations for the mb transforms of the momentum integrals corresponding to the ud triangle diagrams by using belokurov - usyukina trick @xcite for the ladder diagrams in the position space , reducing the multi - fold mb integrals to the two - fold mb integrals .",
    "in this section we describe a trick with a help of which the triangle ladder diagram of @xmath20 loops is reduced to the triangle ladder diagram of @xmath21 loops .",
    "this trick has been published for the first time in paper @xcite .",
