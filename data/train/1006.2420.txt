    "having been introduced over three decades ago @xcite the sequence - alignment problem has remained one of the most actively studied topics in computational biology .",
    "while the vast majority of comparative genomics studies crucially depend on alignment quality inaccuracies abundantly occur .",
    "this can have detrimental effects in all kinds of downstream analyses @xcite .",
    "still , our understanding of the involved biases remains rather rudimentary @xcite,@xcite .",
    "that different methods often yield contradictory statements @xcite further establishes the need for further investigations into the essence of alignment biases and their consequences @xcite .    while the sequence - alignment problem virtually is that of inferring the correct placement of gaps , insertions and deletions ( indels ) have remained the most unreliable parts of the alignments .",
    "for example , lunter et al .",
    "@xcite , in a whole - genome alignment study , observe 96% alignment accuracy for alignment positions which are far away from gaps while accuracy drops down to 56% when considering positions closely surrounding gaps .",
    "they also observe a downward bias in the number of inferred indels which is due to effects termed gap attraction and gap annihilation . decreased numbers of inferred indels",
    "were equally observed in other recent studies @xcite .",
    "this points out that _ numbers and size _ of computationally inferred indels can make statements about alignment quality .",
    "the _ purpose of this paper _ is to _ systematically address _ such questions .",
    "we develop a statistical framework by which to efficiently compute probabilities of the type @xmath0)\\ ] ] where @xmath1 has been randomly sampled from an appropriate pool of protein pairs . in",
    "the following pools contain protein pairs which have a ( either false or true positive ) structural sabmark @xcite ( see below ) alignment . in case of , for example , all pairs of human proteins , ( [ eq.ilp ] ) would act as null distribution for human .",
    "@xmath2 is a local or global optimal , score - based alignment procedure with affine gap penalties such as the affine gap cost version of the needleman - wunsch ( nw ) algorithm @xcite or the smith - waterman ( sw ) algorithm @xcite , @xmath3 is the length of the alignment , @xmath4 denotes alignment similarity that is the fraction of perfectly matching and `` well - behaved '' mismatches vs.   bad  mismatches ( as measured in terms of biochemical affinity @xcite ) and gap positions .",
    "@xmath5 finally denotes the length of the @xmath6-th longest gap in the alignment . in summary , ( [ eq.ilp ] ) can be read as the probability that a nw resp .",
    "sw alignment of length @xmath7 and similarity between @xmath8 and @xmath9 contains at least @xmath6 gaps of length @xmath10 and the reasoning is that gaps which make part of significant such gap combinations are more likely to reflect true indels .",
    "significance is determined conditioned the length @xmath11 of the alignment as well as alignment similarity @xmath12 .",
    "the reasoning behind this is that longer alignments are more likely to accumulate spurious indels such that only increased gap length and multiplicity are significant signs of true indels .",
    "increased similarity @xmath12 , however , indicates that already shorter and less gaps are more likely to reflect true indels simply because an alignment of high similarity is an overall more trustworthy statement . in summary",
    ", we provide a _ statistically sound , systematic _ approach to answering questions such as `` am i to believe that @xmath13 gaps of size at least @xmath14 in an alignment of length @xmath15 and similarity @xmath16 are likely to reflect true indels '' as motivated by the recent studies @xcite .",
    "we opted to address these questions for score - based alignments with affine gap costs for two reasons :    1 .   to employ score - based such alignments",
    "still is a most popular option among most bioinformatics practitioners .",
    "such alignments can be alternatively viewed as viterbi paths in pair hmms . while exact statistics on viterbi paths are hard to obtain and beyond the scope of this study we obtain reasonable approximations by `` viterbi training '' sensibly modified versions of the hidden markov chains which underlie the pair hmms .",
    "we evaluate our statistics on the well - established sabmark @xcite alignments .",
    "sabmark is a database of structurally related proteins which cover the entire known fold space .",
    "the `` twilight zone set '' was particularly designed to represent the worst case scenario for sequence alignment .",
    "while we obtain good results also in the more benign `` superfamilies set '' of alignments it is that worst case scenario of twilight zone alignments where our statistics prove their particular usefulness . here",
    "significance of gap multiplicity is crucial while significance of indel length alone does not necessarily indicate enhanced indel quality .",
    "@xcite re - evaluate match ( but not indel ) positions in global score - based alignments by obtaining reliability scores from suboptimal alignments .",
    "similarly , @xcite derive reliability scores also for indel positions in global score - based alignments .",
    "however , the method presented in @xcite reportedly only works in the case of more than 30% sequence identity .",
    "related work where structural profile information is used is @xcite whereas @xcite re - align rather than re - evaluate .",
    "posterior decoding algorithms ( see e.g.  @xcite for most recent approaches ) are related to re - evaluation of alignments insofar as posterior probabilities can be interpreted as reliability scores . however , how to score indels as a whole by way of posterior decoding does not have a straightforward answer .",
    "we are aware of the potential advantages inherent to posterior decoding algorithms  it is work in progress of ours to combine the ideas of pair hmm based posterior decoding aligners with the ideas from this study .    to assess statistical significance of alignment phenomena",
    "is certainly related to the vastly used altschul - dembo - karlin statistics @xcite where score significance serves as an indicator of protein homology .    to devise computational indel models still remains an area of active research ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the community has not yet come to a final conclusion .",
    "last but not least , the algorithms presented here are related to the algorithms developed in @xcite where the special case of @xmath17 for only global alignments in ( [ eq.milp ] ) was treated to explore the relationship of indel length and functional divergence .",
    "the advances achieved here are to provide null models also for the more complex case of local alignments and to devise a dynamic programming approach also for the case @xmath18 which required to develop generalized inclusion - exclusion arguments .    just like in @xcite",
    "note that _ empirical statistics approaches fail _ for the same reasons that have justified the development of the altschul - dembo - karlin statistics : sizes of samples are usually much too small . here",
    "samples ( indels in alignments ) are subdivided into bins of equal alignment similarity and then further into bins of equal length @xmath7 and @xmath6-th longest indel size @xmath10 .      as above - mentioned",
    ", our work is centered around computation of probabilities @xmath19).\\ ] ] we refer to this problem as _ multiple indel length problem ( milp ) _ in the following .",
    "our contributions then are as follows :    * 1 . *",
    "we are the first ones to address this problem and derive appropriate markov chain based null models from the pair hmms which underlie the nw resp .",
    "sw algorithms to yield _ approximations _ for the probabilities ( [ eq.milp ] ) .",
    "* 2 . * despite having a natural formulation , the inherent markov chain problem had no known efficient solution .",
    "we present the first efficient algorithm to solve it .",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of such statistics by showing that significant gaps in both global and local alignments indicate increased reliability in terms of identifying true structural indel positions .",
    "this became particularly obvious for worst - case twilight zone alignments of at most 25% sequence identity .",
    "thereby we deliver statistical evidence of that computational alignments are biased in terms of numbers and sizes of gaps as described in @xcite . in particular too little numbers of gaps can reflect alignment artifacts .",
    "re - evaluation of indels in score - based both local and global alignments had not been explicitly addressed before , in particular , reliable solutions for worst - case twilight zone alignments were missing .",
    "our work adds to ( rather than competes with ) the above - mentioned related work .    in _ summary",
    "_ , we have complemented extant methods for score - based alignment re - evaluation .",
    "note that none of the existing methods explicitly addresses indel reliability but rather focus on the reliability of substitutions .",

    "[ fig.globalmarkov ] has to be , mutatis mutandis , plugged into the computations of the subsequent subsections .",
    "a local smith - waterman alignment with affine gap penalties of two sequences @xmath20 is associated with the most likely sequence of hidden states ( i.e.  the _ viterbi path _ ) in the pair hmm of fig .",
    "[ fig.pairhmm ] @xcite .",
    "the path of hidden states translates to an alignment of the two sequences by emitting the necessary symbols along the run .",
    "statistics on viterbi paths in hmms pose hard mathematical problems and have not been fully understood . in analogy to @xcite ,",
    "we construct a markov chain whose common , generative statistics mimick the viterbi statistics of interest here .",
    "hence probabilities derived from this markov chain serve as approximations of ( [ eq.milp ] ) .",
    "we do this by the following steps :    1 .",
    "we take the markov chain of the pair hmm in fig .",
    "[ fig.pairhmm ] as a template .",
    "we add two match states @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the original match state is @xmath23 .",
    "we merge the initial resp .",
    "terminal regions into one start resp .",
    "end state .",
    "4 .   we collapse states @xmath24 and @xmath25 into one indel state @xmath26 .",
    "the markov chain approach is justified by the fact that consecutive runs in viterbi paths are approximately governed by the _ geometric distribution _ which is precisely what a markov chain reflects . to see this note that to stay with a state in a viterbi path is ,",
    "approximately , associated with that a self - transition attains maximum probability in the next step .",
    "this depends both on the original transition probability and the backward probability which depends on the observed subsequence to follow starting from that state ( see @xcite , ( 4.30 ) and the related discussion ) .",
    "since it is a general , computational assumption that the background distribution on observed symbols ( amino acids ) is position - independent viterbi path transitions can be assumed to be ( approximately ) position - independent , too . note that assuming sequence to be position - independent is reflected by that scoring schemes are position - independent .",
    "clearly , this is a computational assumption  we are aware of that the biological reality can be different .",
    "the second point is to take into account the non - stationary character of the original markov chain .",
    "note that in local alignments , initial and final consecutive stretches of ( mis)matches are longer than intermediate ( mis)match stretches which translates to @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig.pairhmm ] . to see this in more detail ,",
    "note first that the related discussion in @xcite is on _ stationary _ hmms .",
    "the non - stationarity of the pair hmm under consideration here is due to that the initial and terminal regions are heavily position - dependent . as a result ,",
    "the viterbi paths under consideration have a _ memory _ which can contradict the markov assumption .",
    "the most striking effect is that @xmath28 which reflects that to open up a gap shortly after having initiated the core alignment tends to be avoided in order to circumvent an early gap penalty . in symbols , this means that it is more likely to postpone the core alignment and see ( ry1)(ry1)(ry1 ) ( and , possibly , some more ( rx1 ) before that ) than running into an early gap after alignment initiation ( ry1)mi .",
    "similar considerations hold for the terminal regions .",
    "the second point addresses this by adding initial and terminal match regions m1 and m3 which take the non - stationary character of these areas into account .",
    "point @xmath29 merely reflects that we are only interested in statistics on alignment regions .",
    "point @xmath13 finally accounts for that we do not make a difference between insertions and deletions due to the involved symmetry ( relative to exchanging sequences ) .",
    "we define @xmath30 to be the set of sequences over the alphabet @xmath31 ( for begin , match1 , indel , match2 , match3 and end ) of length @xmath7 that contain at least @xmath6 consecutive @xmath26 stretches of length at least @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the set of sequences with an alignment region of length @xmath7 .",

    "the problem of computing probabilities of the type ( [ eq.milp ] ) has been made the problem of computing the probability that the markov chain generates sequences from @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "while computing @xmath52 is an elementary computation , the question of efficient computation and/or closed formulas for probabilities of the type @xmath39 had not been addressed in the mathematical literature and poses a last , involved problem .",
    "the approach taken here is related to the one taken in @xcite , which treated the special case of single consecutive runs ( i.e.  @xmath17 ) in the context of the two - state markov chains which reflect null models for global alignments .",
    "we generalize this in two aspects .",
    "first , we provide a solution for more than two states ( our approach applies for arbitrary numbers of states ) .",
    "second , we show how to deal with multiple runs .",
    "the probability event design trick inherent to our solution was adopted from that of @xcite . the solution provided in @xcite",
    "can be used for the ( rather irrelevant ) case of global alignments with linear gap penalties , i.e.  gap opening and extension are identically scored .",

    "for example , @xmath56 .",
    "we furthermore denote the standard scalar product on @xmath55 by @xmath57 .",
    "efficient computation of the probabilities @xmath39 is obtained by a dynamic programming approach . as usual , we collect the markov chain parameters ( in accordance with fig .",

    "the initial distribution reflects that we start an alignment from the begin state .",
    "more formally , @xmath60 . for example , according to the laws that govern a markov chain , the probability of being in the indel state i at position @xmath61 in a sequence generated by the markov chain is @xmath62 it can be seen that naive approaches to computing @xmath63 result in runtimes that are exponential in @xmath7 , the length of the alignments , which is infeasible .",
    "efficient computation of these probabilities is helped by adopting the event design trick of @xcite . in detail , we define @xmath64 to be the set of sequences that have a run of state i of length @xmath10 that stretches from positions @xmath61 to @xmath65 and ends at position @xmath65 , that is , the run is followed by a visit of state different from i at position @xmath66 .",
    "we further define @xmath67 which can be interpreted as the state the markov chain is in if we know that the markov chain has left state i at the time step before .",
