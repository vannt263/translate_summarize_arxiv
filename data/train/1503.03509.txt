    "competitive team sports , including , for example , american football , soccer , basketball and hockey , serve as model systems for social competition , a connection that continues to foster intense popular interest .",
    "this passion stems , in part , from the apparently paradoxical nature of these sports . on one hand ,",
    "events within each game are unpredictable , suggesting that chance plays an important role .",
    "on the other hand , the athletes are highly skilled and trained , suggesting that differences in ability are fundamental .",
    "this tension between luck and skill is part of what makes these games exciting for spectators and it also contributes to sports being an exemplar for quantitative modeling , prediction and human decision - making  @xcite , and for understanding broad aspects of social competition and cooperation  @xcite .    in a competitive team sport ,",
    "the two teams vie to produce events ( `` goals '' ) that increase their score , and the team with the higher score at the end of the game is the winner .",
    "( this structure is different from individual sports like running , swimming and golf , or judged sports , like figure skating , diving , and dressage . )",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the instantaneous difference in the team scores . by viewing game scoring dynamics as a time series",
    ", many properties of these competitions may be quantitatively studied  @xcite .",
    "past work has investigated , for example , the timing of scoring events  @xcite , long - range correlations in scoring  @xcite , the role of timeouts  @xcite , streaks and `` momentum '' in scoring  @xcite , and the impact of spatial positioning and playing field design  @xcite .    in this paper , we theoretically and empirically investigate a simple yet decisive characteristic of individual games : the times in a game when the lead changes .",
    "a lead change occurs whenever the score difference @xmath2 returns to 0 .",
    "part of the reason for focusing on lead changes is that these are the points in a game that are often the most exciting .",
    "although we are interested in lead - change dynamics for all sports , we first develop our mathematical results and compare them to data drawn from professional basketball , where the agreement between theory and data is the most compelling .",
    "we then examine data for three other major competitive american team sports :  college and professional football , and professional hockey , and we provide some commentary as to their differences and similarities .    across these sports",
    ", we find that many of their statistical properties are explained by modeling the evolution of the lead @xmath3 as a simple random walk .",
    "more strikingly , seemingly unrelated properties of lead statistics , specifically , the distribution of the times @xmath1 : ( i ) for which one team is leading @xmath4 , ( ii ) for the last lead change @xmath5 , and ( iii ) when the maximal lead occurs @xmath6 , are all described by the same celebrated arcsine law  @xcite : @xmath7 for a game that lasts a time @xmath8 .",
    "these three results are , respectively , the _ first _ , _ second _ , and _ third _ arcsine laws .",
    "our analysis is based on a comprehensive data set of all points scored in league games over multiple consecutive seasons each in the national basketball association ( abbreviated nba henceforth ) , all divisions of ncaa college football ( cfb ) , the national football league ( nfl ) , and the national hockey league ( nhl )  .",
    "these data cover 40,747 individual games and comprise 1,306,515 individual scoring events , making it one of the largest sports data sets studied .",
    "each scoring event is annotated with the game clock time @xmath1 of the event , its point value , and the team scoring the event .",
    "for simplicity , we ignore events outside of regulation time ( i.e. , overtime ) .",
    "we also combine the point values of events with the same clock time ( such as a successful foul shot immediately after a regular score in basketball ) .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] summarizes these data and related facts for each sport .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for american football and hockey , it would be useful to understand how the particular structure of these sports would modify a random walk model .",
    "for instance , in american football , the two most common point values for scoring plays are 7 ( touchdown plus extra point ) and 3 ( field goal ) . the random - walk model averages these events , which will underestimate the likelihood that a few high - value events could eliminate what otherwise seems like a safe lead .",
    "moreover , in football the ball is moved incrementally down the field through a series of plays .",
    "the team with ball possession has four attempts to move the ball a specific minimum distance ( 10 yards ) or else lose possession ; if it succeeds , that team retains possession and repeats this effort to further move the ball . as a result , the spatial location of the ball on the field likely plays an important role in determining both the probability of scoring and the value of this event ( field goal versus touchdown ) . in hockey ,",
    "players are frequently rotated on and off the ice so that a high intensity of play is maintained throughout the game .",
    "thus the pattern of these substitutions between potential all - star players and less skilled `` grinders''can change the relative strength of the two teams every few minutes .",
    "a model based on random walks provides a remarkably good description for the dynamics of scoring in competitive team sports . from this starting point",
    ", we found that the celebrated arcsine law of eq .   closely describes the distribution of times for :",
    "( i ) one team is leading @xmath4 ( first arcsine law ) , ( ii ) the last lead change in a game @xmath5 ( second arcsine law ) , and ( iii ) when the maximal lead in the game occurs @xmath6 ( third arcsine law ) .",
    "strikingly , these arcsine distributions are bimodal , with peaks for extremal values of the underlying variable .",
    "thus both the time of the last lead and the time of the maximal lead are most likely to occur at the start or the end of a game .",
    "these predictions are in accord with the empirically observed scoring patterns within more than 40,000 games of professional basketball , american football ( college or professional ) , and professional hockey . for basketball , in particular , the agreement between the data and the theory is quite close .",
    "all the sports also exhibit scoring anomalies at the end of each scoring period , which arise from a much higher scoring rate around these times ( figs .",
    "[ lt ] and  [ fig : last : lead : change ] ) . for football and hockey , there is also a substantial initial time range of reduced scoring that is reflected in @xmath5 and @xmath6 both approaching zero as @xmath9 .",
    "football and hockey also exhibit other small but systematic deviations from the second and third arcsine laws that remain unexplained .",
    "the implication for basketball , in particular , is that a typical game can be effectively viewed as repeated coin - tossings , with each toss subject to the features of antipersistence , an overall bias , and an effective restoring force that tends to shrink leads over time ( which reduces the likelihood of a blowout ) .",
    "these features represent inconsequential departures from a pure random - walk model .",
    "cynically , our results suggest that one should watch only the first few and last few minutes of a professional basketball game ; the rest of the game is as predictable as watching repeated coin tossings .",
    "on the other hand , the high degree of unpredictability of events in the middle of a game may be precisely what makes these games so exciting for sports fans .",
    "the random - walk model also quantitatively predicts the probability that a specified lead of size @xmath0 with @xmath1 seconds left in a game is `` safe , '' i.e. , will not be reversed before the game ends .",
    "our predictions are quantitatively accurate for basketball and hockey . for basketball",
    ", our approach significantly outperforms a popular heuristic for determining when a lead is safe . for football ,",
    "our prediction is marginally less accurate , and we postulated a possible explanation for why this inaccuracy could arise in college football , where the discrepancy between the random - walk model and the data is the largest .",
    "traditional analyses of sports have primarily focused on the composition of teams and the individual skill levels of the players . scoring events and game outcomes",
    "are generally interpreted as evidence of skill differences between opposing teams .",
    "the random walk view that we formalize and test here is not at odds with the more traditional skill - based view .",
    "our perspective is that team competitions involve highly skilled and motivated players who employ well - conceived strategies .",
    "the overarching result of such keen competition is to largely negate systematic advantages so that all that remains is the residual stochastic element of the game .",
    "the appearance of the arcsine law , a celebrated result from the theory of random walks , in the time that one team leads , the time of the last lead change , and the time at which the maximal lead occurs , illustrates the power of the random - walk view of competition .",
    "moreover , the random - walk model makes surprisingly accurate predictions of whether a current lead is effectively safe , i.e. , will not be overturned before the game ends , a result that may be of practical interest to sports enthusiasts .",
    "the general agreement between the random - walk model for lead - change dynamics across four different competitive team sports suggests that this paradigm has much to offer for the general issue of understanding human competitive dynamics .",
    "moreover , the discrepancies between the empirical data and our predictions in sports other than basketball may help identify alternative mechanisms for scoring dynamics that do not involve random walks .",
    "although our treatment focused on team - level statistics , another interesting direction for future work would be to focus on understanding how individual behaviors within such social competitions aggregate up to produce a system that behaves effectively like a simple random walk . exploring these and other hypotheses , and developing more accurate models for scoring dynamics , are potential fruitful directions for further work .",
