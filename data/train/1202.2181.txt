    "blazars are a sub - class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that are characterized by double - peaked nonthermal emission which extends from radio to gamma rays .",
    "in addition , they are also characterized by rapid flux variability in all bands , polarization in radio and optical bands , and highly collimated relativistic jets .",
    "agns have been classified into various classes according to the observed features , which can be understood by differences of the angle between the jet and our line of sight dominantly , and also circumnuclear obscuration and relativistic beaming are candidates of deciding factor @xcite .",
    "blazars include bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , which have jets within a few degrees of the line of sight .",
    "following the whipple group s discovery of the first tev gamma - ray blazar mkn 421 @xcite , blazars have became one of the most interesting class of object for vhe gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "recently , the agile @xcite and fermi @xcite gamma - ray space satellites have been launched , the fermi / lat detector has sensitivities about factor 30 enhanced from egret @xcite . combining simultaneous observational data from these satellites with vhe gamma - ray data from imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts )",

    "h@xmath02356@xmath1309 is a high - frequency peaked bl lac ( hbl ) at a redshift of @xmath2 @xcite , which was discovered in x - rays by the uhuru satellite @xcite .",
    "some authors classified this object as `` extreme hbl '' @xcite based on its synchrotron peak at extremely high frequency . in 2004 ,",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "group discovered this object in the vhe gamma - ray band above 0.2tev at the @xmath3 level of significance @xcite , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "the observed vhe gamma - ray spectrum between 0.2tev and 1.3tev is consistent with a power - law with photon index of @xmath4 .",
    "h.e.s.s .",
    "observations were additionally made from 2005 to 2007 and they found little flux variability on the time scale of a few years @xcite .",
    "the cangaroo - iii telescope was pointed to h@xmath02356@xmath1309 in 2005 , but no evidence of vhe gamma - ray emissions above 750gev was found @xcite .",

    "this object has been intensively studied in vhe gamma rays , since the durham group first reported vhe gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the cangaroo group tried to find evidence of vhe gamma - ray emissions but without success ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this object was confirmed as a vhe gamma - ray source by the h.e.s.s .",
    "group in 2005 @xcite .",
    "in july 2006 , the h.e.s.s .",
    "group detected an extreme flaring of pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 , and reported flux variation on the time scale of minutes @xcite , the flare triggered cangaroo - iii observations of pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 and vhe gamma rays above 660gev were detected at the @xmath6 significance level @xcite . during the same period , the magic group also detected pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 above 400gev @xcite .",
    "since then , many multiwavelength observations of pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 have been carried out ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and part of the multiwavelength campaign in 2008 ( august 25 to september 6 ) was reported in @xcite .",
    "cangaroo - iii observations were also conducted during the 2008 summer , but no significant gamma - ray signal above 720gev was found @xcite .",
    "the flux upper limits were obtained in this observation slightly higher than h.e.s.s . observed spectra @xcite .",
    "this object was detected also in the gev energy region by egret @xcite and fermi / lat @xcite .",
    "pks@xmath00537@xmath1441 , at a redshift of @xmath7 @xcite , is one of the most distant and the most luminous members of low - frequency peaked bl lac ( lbl ) class , and may be part of a small galaxy cluster / group with several companions @xcite .",
    "although classic / normal bl lacs have no features in their optical spectra , this source has several kinds of broad lines @xcite , and while the lines disappear in high states @xcite .",
    "therefore , pks@xmath00537@xmath1441 is discussed as a bridging object between the bl lac and fsrq classes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although no detection of this source has been claimed in the vhe gamma - ray regime , gev gamma - ray detections have been reported by egret @xcite , agile @xcite , and fermi @xcite at high significance levels , and gev gamma - ray flares are often reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "3c@xmath0279 is a distant fsrq , located at a redshift of @xmath8 @xcite , and is one of the most intensively studied blazars over many years @xcite . in the vhe region ,",
    "the whipple group tried to detect vhe gamma rays several times in the 1980s , but could not @xcite .",
    "it was first detected in 2006 by the magic group above 80gev @xcite , and became the most distant ( identified ) source of vhe gamma rays .",
    "the magic group detection of the source again on 2007 january 16 @xcite , however , observations by the h.e.s.s .",
    "group from january 18 to 21 did not detect this source @xcite . at gev energies , 3c@xmath0279 is a well known gev gamma - ray blazar detected by egret @xcite , agile @xcite , and fermi @xcite , and gev gamma - ray flares have been reported several times ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a multiwavelength campaign including fermi / lat was carried out from july 2008 to june 2009 , and a change of the optical polarization associated with a gev gamma - ray flare was reported @xcite . during this period",
    ", the magic group did not detect vhe gamma rays from this object @xcite .",
    "cangaroo - iii observations are also done during february and march 2009 , and this results are reported here .    in this paper , we report the results of vhe gamma - ray searches from these four blazars , which were observed with the cangaroo - iii telescope in the years from 2005 to 2009 .",
    "this includes a reanalysis of h@xmath02356@xmath1309 and pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 data which were reported by @xcite , and new results for pks@xmath00537@xmath1441 and 3c@xmath0279 .",
    "we also discuss the multiwavelength spectra using a simple one - zone leptonic model consisting of a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) radiation and an external compton ( ec ) radiation field .",
    "the cangaroo - iii telescope system consists of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes which are operated near woomera , south australia ( @xmath9e , @xmath10s , 160 m a.s.l . ) .",
    "these telescopes use altazimuth mounts and are placed at the east ( t1 ) , west ( t2 ) , south ( t3 ) , and north ( t4 ) corners of a diamond with sides of @xmath11100 m. the t1 telescope , which is the oldest telescope , has not been operated for observation since 2004 due to its narrower field of view ( fov ) and higher energy threshold . we also have not operated the t2 telescope since 2008 due to severe deterioration of its mirror .",
    "only t3 and t4 telescopes are used for analyses in this work .",
    "they have parabolic reflectors of 10 m diameter with an 8 m focal length , and each reflector is composed of 114 small spherical mirrors of 80 cm diameter and with an average radius of curvature of 16.4 m , which are made of fiber reinforced plastic .",
    "each imaging camera is an array of 427 pmt pixels of @xmath12 size , with a total fov of @xmath114@xmath13 .",
    "the pmt signals were recorded by charge adcs and multi - hit tdcs .",
    "details of the mirror , the data acquisition ( daq ) system , the camera , the standard calibration method , and the total performance of the light collecting system are given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the cangaroo - iii observations of four blazars are summarized in table [ obs_table ] .",
    "each observation was made for 1218 moonless nights using the @xmath14 mode , in which the pointing position of each telescope was shifted in declination by @xmath15 every 20 min from the target .",
    "the wobble mode enables simultaneous observation of background regions with the target region . these observations , except for the case of 3c@xmath0279 ,",
    "were basically carried out at zenith angles smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "details of each observation follow .",
    "the observations of h@xmath02356@xmath1309 were carried out over 14 nights during the period between 2005 july 8 and august 12 with the three telescopes ( t2 , t3 and t4 ) . due to daq trouble with the t2 telescope , twofold",
    "coincidence data ( i.e. , t3 and t4 ) were used in the analysis .",
    "the total observation time is 30.3 h and the mean zenith angle of the observations was 12.7@xmath13 .",
    "the observations of pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 were made over 18 nights from 2008 july 29 to september 27 with two telescopes ( t3 and t4 ) for a total of 57.5 h , with a mean zenith angle for the observations of 14.6@xmath13 .",
    "pks@xmath00537@xmath1441 was observed in 14 nights during the period between 2008 november 24 and december 29 with the t3 and t4 telescopes .",
    "the observations were carried out over 36.7 h and the mean zenith angle of the observations was 17.2@xmath13 .",
    "the observations of 3c@xmath0279 were carried out over 12 nights during the period between 2009 february 24 and march 28 using the twofold coincidence of t3t4 .",
    "the total observation time is 40.1 h and the mean zenith angle of the observation was 34.3@xmath13 . because the culmination altitude of the target position is low ,",
    "the observations were carried out at zenith angles up to @xmath17 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have observed four selected blazars , h@xmath02356@xmath1309 , pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 , pks@xmath00537@xmath1441 and 3c@xmath0279 , with the cangaroo - iii imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope from 2005 to 2009 .",
    "no statistically significant excess of events above 510720gev from the direction of any of these objects was found , and we derived flux upper limits for vhe gamma - ray emissions .",
    "in addition , we analyzed gev gamma - ray data between 0.2gev and 300gev taken with fermi / lat from august 2008 to may 2011 .    to derive some important physical parameters of these blazars , we consider a simple leptonic jet model to explain the multiwavelength seds including gev and tev spectra , even though non - simultaneous .",
    "the observed sed of h@xmath02356@xmath1309 ( hbl ) could be explained by a simple ssc model with a single power - law electron spectrum , and to keep a consistency with gev spectrum , we need to assume a large beaming factor @xmath18 and weak magnetic field strength of 0.012 g . radiation from pks@xmath02155@xmath1304 , a nearby hbl , was well modeled by the ssc scenario , and obtained parameters are consistent with earlier works .",
    "pks@xmath00537@xmath1441 , a luminous lbl , was studied and we found ssc + ec model could explain the observed multiwavelength spectrum where the ec component is dominant in the gamma - ray photons .",
    "the sed of one of the distant fsrq , 3c@xmath0279 , were also well explained by the ssc + ec model .",
    "additionally , from our parameter fit results in table [ table_sed_fit ] as the hbl to the fsrq of blazar sub - classes , it is seen that the beaming factor becomes smaller , and in contrast the strength of the magnetic field becomes stronger and the size of blob becomes larger . although we could not take into account of the uncertainties such as simultaneity of the data and the differences of models , these latter two tendencies are in agreement with the proposed blazar sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
