    "the @xmath0 operator for a few nontrivial quantum - mechanical models has been calculated exactly @xcite by solving ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) .",
    "however , in general this system of equations is extremely difficult to solve analytically .",
    "therefore , in most cases a perturbative approach has been adopted for the solution of these equations @xcite .    the standard approach to solving ( [ e1])-([e3 ] )",
    "has been to express the @xmath0 operator in a simple and natural form as an exponential of a dirac hermitian operator @xmath14 multiplying the parity operator @xmath19 : @xmath20 note that @xmath21 is precisely the metric operator @xmath22 discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . this operator can be used to construct a similarity transformation that maps the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath23 to an isospectral hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "if we seek a solution for @xmath0 in the form ( [ e4 ] ) , we find that ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , which can be thought of as _ kinematical _ equations because they hold for all choices of @xmath23 , imply that @xmath12 is an odd function of the momentum operator @xmath8 and an even function of the coordinate operator @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the problem is then reduced to finding the solution to ( [ e3 ] ) , which can be thought of as a _ dynamical _ equation because it refers to the hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "it is difficult to find a closed - form analytical solution to ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "however , in the past this equation has been solved perturbatively as follows : express the hamiltonian in the form @xmath5 and treat @xmath11 as a small parameter .",
    "then , seek @xmath14 as a formal perturbation series in _ odd _ powers of @xmath11 : @xmath24    the obvious question to ask is , why do only odd powers in @xmath11 appear in the perturbation series ( [ e5 ] ) ?",
    "the explanation that has been given in the past is that even powers of @xmath11 are excluded from the series because @xmath12 is required to be odd in @xmath8 and even in @xmath9 .",
    "the reasoning goes as follows : in the quantum - mechanical cases that have been studied so far , such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath27 is the harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian . if there were a term @xmath28 in the series ( [ e5 ] ) , then @xmath17 would satisfy the commutation relation @xmath29=0 $ ] .",
    "the vanishing of this commutator implies that @xmath17 is a function of @xmath16 , and thus it is an _ even _ function of @xmath8 , which shows that @xmath30 . once it is established that @xmath30 , it is relatively easy to show ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) that @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we show in this paper that this argument is actually incorrect ; there are indeed solutions to the commutator equation @xmath29=0 $ ] that are _ odd _ in @xmath8  infinitely many such solutions , in fact .",
    "it is precisely because of the existence of these odd-@xmath8 solutions that the @xmath0 operator is nonunique .",
    "it has recently become clear that the nonuniqueness of the @xmath0 operator has important implications for the mathematical and physical interpretation of @xmath1-symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite . in ref .  @xcite it is shown that if the @xmath0 operator is nonunique , then it is unbounded , and in this paper we verify this result explicitly .",
    "the paper @xcite is relevant because it discusses for the first time the existence of multiple ( nonunique ) solutions to the commutator equation ( [ e3 ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the _ inhomogeneous _ commutator equation @xmath33=2h_1 $ ] has an infinite number of particular solutions , which differ from one another by solutions to the associated _ homogeneous _ commutator equation @xmath34=0 $ ] , and it recognizes that the solutions @xmath35 are not necessarily functions of @xmath16 only .",

    "@xcite , where a particular time - operator solution @xmath36 to the inhomogeneous commutator equation @xmath37=i$ ] is called _ minimal _ and a classification of the infinite number of associated nonminimal solutions is given .",
    "the approach used in the current paper is based on the recognition that finding multiple solutions for @xmath13 in ( [ e5 ] ) is not the only way to demonstrate nonuniqueness . here",
    ", we introduce a clearer and more fundamental way to explain the nonuniqueness of the @xmath0 operator .",
    "we show that a more general way to represent @xmath14 is by the expansion @xmath38 in which all nonnegative integer powers of @xmath11 appear .",

    "the operators @xmath48 are described in detail in refs .",

    "introducing the weyl - ordered form of @xmath48 allows one to extend the operators @xmath48 either to negative values of @xmath51 by using the first sum or to negative values of @xmath50 by using the second sum .",
    "the commutation and anticommutation relations in ( [ e8 ] ) remain valid when @xmath50 is negative or when @xmath51 is negative .    to find solutions that are odd in @xmath8 and even in @xmath9 to the commutator equation ( [ e7 ] )",
    ", we take @xmath47 to have the general form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a parameter . substituting ( [ e10 ] ) into ( [ e7 ] )",
    ", we obtain the following two - term recursion relation for the coefficients @xmath58 : @xmath59    this recursion relation is self - terminating ; that is , if we choose @xmath60 , then @xmath61 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath58 vanishes for @xmath62 , and @xmath58 for @xmath63 is determined in terms of @xmath61 as the solution to the recursion relation ( [ e11 ] ) : @xmath64 the series ( [ e10 ] ) with coefficients ( [ e12 ] ) can be summed as a binomial expansion : @xmath65 thus , for each @xmath66 the odd-@xmath8 and even-@xmath9 one - parameter family of solutions to the homogeneous commutator equation ( [ e7 ] ) is @xmath67 where we have used the identity @xcite @xmath68    as stated in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] , we can see that while @xmath69 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath40 , it is _ not _ a function of @xmath16 because by construction it is odd in @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , while the construction of the solutions in ( [ e14 ] ) involves series in inverse powers of @xmath8 , these solutions are well behaved as @xmath70 . to see explicitly",

    "it is important to point out that for the harmonic oscillator , which corresponds to @xmath74 , the metric operator @xmath75 is just unity when @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the metric operator is bounded of this special case . however , for @xmath17 in ( [ e16 ] ) , the metric operator is no longer bounded , but rather for large @xmath9 it behaves like @xmath76 and for large @xmath8 it behaves like @xmath77 .",
    "needless to say , since there is an infinite number of possible choices for @xmath17 , there is an infinite number of possible metric operators .",
    "only one of the metric operators is bounded @xcite .",
    "we observed in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] that even though solutions @xmath69 in ( [ e14 ] ) were constructed by performing a formal infinite sum over arbitrary powers of the inverse momentum operator @xmath78 , these solutions are well behaved as @xmath70 .",
    "however , the calculations in sec .  [ s2 ] are certainly not rigorous .",
    "the aim of this section is to provide mathematical support for the validity of the formulas in ( [ e14 ] ) .",
    "specifically , since the @xmath0 operator commutes with the hamiltonian , the @xmath51th eigenstate @xmath79 of the hamiltonian must also be an eigenstate of @xmath0 .",

    "for this to be true , @xmath79 must be an eigenstate of @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath81 for all @xmath51 : @xmath82 in this section we show by explicit calculation in which we use powerful summation techniques that this is indeed the case . here , we limit our calculation to the case @xmath71 .",
    "we first consider the ground state @xmath83 and then generalize to the @xmath51th eigenstate .    from ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) we see that @xmath84 is given by @xmath85",
    "also , the unnormalized eigenfunctions of the harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian in coordinate space are given by @xmath86 .",
    "while the formal sum in ( [ e19 ] ) can be written as ( [ e16 ] ) , it is difficult to use this result to verify the eigenvalue equation ( [ e18 ] ) .",
    "a better strategy is to calculate the action of each term in the sum in ( [ e19 ] ) on the eigenstates and then to perform the summation over @xmath87 .    because inverse powers of the momentum operator arise in ( [ e19 ] ) ,",
