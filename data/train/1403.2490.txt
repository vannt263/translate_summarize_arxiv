    "over the past few decades a variety of fundamental protocols for implementing quantum computation ( qc ) have been explored nielsen2000,loock1 .",
    "there are two different models in the qc regime , which are the traditional circuit model , in which unitary evolution and coherent control of individual qubits are required @xcite , and the cluster model , in which the logical operations are achieved through measurements and classical feedforward of measured results on a cluster entangled state @xcite . due to the role of measurements",
    "the qc based on cluster entanglement is essentially irreversible , and thus it is named the one - way qc @xcite .",
    "the one - way qc was first experimentally demonstrated with a four - qubit cluster state of single photons @xcite . in the meanwhile ,",
    "an universal qc model using continuous - variable ( cv ) cluster states was proposed @xcite . applying the approach of quantum optics , cv cluster states of optical field can be unconditionally prepared zhang2006,loock2007,su2007,yukawa2008 , and the one - way cvqc",
    "can be deterministically performed @xcite .",
    "therefore , the probabilistic problems existing in most qubit information systems of single photons @xcite can be overcome .",
    "it has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that one - mode linear unitary bogoliubov ( lubo ) transformations corresponding to hamiltonians that are quadratic in quadrature amplitude and phase operators of quantized optical modes ( qumodes ) can be implemented using a four - mode linear cluster state @xcite . at the same time , the deutsch - jozsa algorithm for cvqc has been proposed @xcite . following the theoretical proposals ,",
    "the different logical gates used for cvqc were experimentally realized .",
    "first , a quantum nondemolition sum gate and a quadratic phase gate for one - way cvqc were demonstrated based on utilizing squeezed states of light by furusawa s group in 2008 and 2009 , respectively yoshikawa2008,miwa2009 .",
    "successively , a controlled - x gate based on a four - mode optical cv cluster state was presented by peng s group , in which a pair of quantum teleportation elements were used for the transformation of quantum states from input target and control states to output states wang2010 .",
    "later , the squeezing operation , fourier transformation and controlled - phase gate were also achieved by ukai et al . ,",
    "in which four - mode optical cluster states served as resource quantum states ukai2011,ukai20112 .    here",
    ", we present a measurement - based logical operation scheme with which the squeezing and fourier transformations for a single qumode can be implemented using an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entangled state as the resource .",
    "these operations can be achieved on a fixed experimental system only by choosing appropriate measurement angles in homodyne detections . since epr entanglement of optical modes is deterministic and homodyne detections can be well controlled , the presented cvqc gates are operated in a completely unconditional and controllable version . by changing the quadrature measurement angles of homodyne detections the squeezing operations at three different squeezing levels ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 db ) and fourier transformation",
    "are experimentally performed .",
    "the experimental results and the corresponding theoretical expectations are in good agreement .",
    "as is well known , the epr entanglement is equivalent to a two - mode cluster state @xcite , and thus , qc using an epr state can be implemented on two submodes of a large cluster state as a step of a full one - way cvqc .",
    "we also prove that the squeezing degree and the fidelity of the output mode obtained by using an epr state are better than that obtained using a four - mode cluster state if the squeezing of the initial resource state is identical .",
    "that is because the excess noises deriving from imperfect squeezing of the resource state in the epr system are less than that in the four - mode cluster state system .",
    "theorefore , the presented cvqc schemes not only decrease the requirement to quantum resource and simplify the experimental system significantly but also enhance the quality of the output states .",
    "finally , we point out that the set - up can be applied to perform a cascaded operation of a squeezing gate and a fourier gate by changing the relative phase between the input mode and a submode of the epr state , which shows further the diversity of the protocol .",
    "the single - mode squeezing gate in cvqc depending on quantized optical modes * *  * * is expressed by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the squeezing parameter , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the amplitude and phase quadratures of an optical mode @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "an input mode is coupled to a submode of the epr entangled state ( e1 ) via a 50% beam - splitter bs@xmath13 .",
    "the two output modes of bs@xmath13 are measured by homodyne detection systems hd@xmath13 and hd@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the measured results are fedforward to the other submode of the epr entangled state ( e2 ) by classical feedforward circuits and electro - optical modulators ( eom ) . the sum ( + ) and difference (  ) of the photocurrents measured by hd@xmath13  and hd@xmath14",

    "are measured by two homodyne detection systems , the measurement angles of which are chosen as 0 and @xmath16 , respectively . however , in the presented quantum logic operation the measurement angle will be chosen arbitrarily , and the squeezing degree of the squeezing gate will be determined by the measurement angle .",
    "thus , we can say that the cvqc logic operation is implemented by means of a  cv quantum teleportation process with an arbitrarily chosen measurement angle .    if the input mode is coupled to mode e@xmath13  with a @xmath16  phase difference on bs@xmath13 , the measurement results of hd@xmath13  and hd@xmath14 , @xmath17  and @xmath18 , are expressed by @xmath19where @xmath20  and @xmath21  are the measurement angles of hd@xmath22  and hd@xmath14 , respectively .",

    "( 3 ) in the case of ideal epr state with eq . ( 1 ) , we can see that the transformation corresponds  to a single - mode amplitude and phase squeezing gate with @xmath32  and @xmath33 , respectively . in this case , the transformation matrix is given by @xmath34equation ( 5 ) shows that the squeezing parameter  @xmath4  depends on  the measurement angles . when the measurement angle is varied from @xmath35  to @xmath36  the squeezing degree of the squeezing gate increases from * *  * * 0 to @xmath37 .",
    "* *  * * the squeezing level can be controlled by choosing different measurement angles .",
