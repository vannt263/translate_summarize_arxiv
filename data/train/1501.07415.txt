    "we improve those results and illustrate the improvement level with respect to the associated convergence rates for the cesro operator equation in @xmath2 and for specific denoising problems . since the variational inequality approach requires injectivity of the forward operator ( cf .",
    "* proposition  5.6 ) ) , we restrict all considerations in this paper to _ injective _ linear forward operators which also ensure uniquely determined solutions for the corresponding linear operator equations .",
    "the focus on injectivity is also motivated by the fact that the ill - posedness concept of section  [ s4 ] suggested by m.  z.  nashed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) would require substantial technical refinements in a general banach space setting if non - injective operators were included .",

    "the following proposition shows that solving this equation is always an ill - posed problem , even if the original equation ( [ eq : tildeopeq ] ) is well - posed .    for the proof and for further reference",
    "we note that the synthesis operator @xmath43 is a composition @xmath44 of the embedding operator @xmath45 and the riesz isomorphism @xmath46 .",
