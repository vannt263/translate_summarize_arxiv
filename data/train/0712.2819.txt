    "binary black hole ( bbh ) merger  in which two spinning black holes inspiral due to the emission of gravitational radiation and eventually merge to form a single spinning black hole  is one of the most important problems in classical general relativity , and has significant ramifications for astrophysics , cosmology , and gravitational - wave observations . for decades , analytical and numerical approaches to the bbh merger problem",
    "have been frustrated by conceptual and technical difficulties associated with solving the non - linear einstein equations  especially during the last few orbits and final plunge , when the `` luminosity '' in gravitational radiation is highest .",
    "dramatic progress came in 2005 , as new insights and increased computational resources finally allowed numerical relativists to simulate the _ entire _ merger  including the last few orbits of inspiral , the plunge , the formation of a common event horizon , and the ringdown of the final kerr black hole @xcite . following this breakthrough ,",
    "simulations of bbh merger have produced a number of remarkable results .",
    "the most surprising and interesting results have been obtained just within the past year , from simulations of merging black holes with large initial spins @xcite .",
    "the result that has received the most attention is that highly - spinning initial black holes can merge to form a final black hole with an enormous recoil velocity  as large as @xmath3  relative to the binary s center - of - momentum frame @xcite .",
    "the idea of a supermassive black hole rocketing through its host galaxy at such a speed has understandably caught the attention of many astrophysicists !    in this paper , we highlight a second surprising result . despite the complicated and non - linear dynamics of the merger process",
    ", the final state of the merger seems , in some sense , to be an unexpectedly simple and smooth function of the initial state of the binary .",
    "we would like to make this statement more quantitative and precise .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we introduced a `` spin expansion '' formalism for understanding aspects of bbh merger .",
    "we expand on this proposal in several ways in the present paper .",
    "here is a recap of the basic idea . even though the merger is a messy non - linear process , it is useful to regard it as a map from a simple initial state ( two well separated kerr black holes with mass ratio @xmath4 and dimensionless spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) to a simple final state ( a final kerr black with mass @xmath0 , spin vector @xmath7 and kick velocity @xmath1 )",
    ". given any final quantity @xmath8 ( _ e.g. _  @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath7 ) , we can taylor expand the function @xmath9 around @xmath10 , and use symmetry arguments to dramatically reduce the number of independent terms at each order .",
    "when compared with published simulation results , this `` spin expansion '' seems to rapidly converge : the leading - order terms yield a surprisingly good first approximation , the next - to - leading - order terms give an even better approximation , and so on . in the present paper , we present these points in detail , and explore some of their implications and extensions .      _ how does the spin expansion complement other approaches to the bbh merger problem ? _    * 1 . *",
    "first , it is _ simple_. previous approaches  notably the post - newtonian approximation and full numerical relativity  are highly technical and sophisticated and have taken decades to develop .",
    "by contrast , we believe that the derivations in this paper will be accessible , even to physicists with no prior expertise in this area .",
    "second , it is _ general_. in this paper , we focus on applying the spin expansion to the final black hole s mass , kick , and spin ( @xmath11 ) , but we expect that analogous arguments may be useful for studying _ any _ other final observable with well defined transformation properties under the simple symmetries @xmath12 discussed below",
    ". this may also include the multipoles of the gravitational - wave signal emitted by the binary  this is currently a speculation , and remains a topic for future work .",
    "third , it is _ conceptually distinct_. previous approaches attempt to follow the _ dynamics _ of the merger  by solving the einstein equations numerically , or through some analytical approximation .",
    "by contrast , our approach is to consider the map directly from the initial state to the final state , and thereby `` leap over '' the complicated merger dynamics in between . to constrain this map ,",
    "we rely purely on _ symmetry _ arguments , together with the _ assumption _ ( supported by simulations ) that the taylor expansion of the map around @xmath10 converges rapidly .",
    "therefore , our approach clarifies which aspects of the final state are due to the complicated non - linearities of einstein s equations , and which aspects follow from more elementary considerations .",
    "* 4 . * fourth , it is _ practical _ for cosmological and astrophysical applications . for example , a cosmological simulation of galaxy merger may also wish to track the corresponding supermassive black holes , since their feedback may be important for galactic structure and evolution .",
    "of course , it would be hopeless to follow the bbh dynamics in detail  the dynamical time near final merger is too short relative to the other timescales in the problem . instead , one is likely to resort to a simplifying algorithm : _",
    "e.g. _  when the two holes get sufficiently close , they are replaced by a single hole with appropriate quantities @xmath13 .",
    "the fact that the spin expansion maps the initial state ( well before merger ) directly to the final state ( well after merger ) makes it well suited for these types of problems .",
    "fifth , it is _",
    "efficient_. to fully specify the initial bbh spin configuration , we must specify 6 numbers  3 components each for the initial spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "what is the most economical way to map out this 6-dimensional space with numerical simulations ?",
    "if we crudely put 10 grid points along each direction , we would need @xmath14 simulations  an impossibly large value , since each simulation is very computationally expensive . on the other hand",
    ", we can use the spin expansion to map out the _ same _ 6-dimensional space , at second or third - order accuracy , with only @xmath15 simulations  a huge computational savings !",
    "this issue is treated in detail in sec .",
    "[ s : prog ] . in this sense , the spin expansion acts like a kind of `` data compression , '' describing the 6-dimensional space of initial spins more succinctly , without _ over_simplifying it .",
    "* sixth , it is _ valid through the entire merger . _",
    "the spin expansion is based on _ exact _ symmetries of general relativity , which are equally valid during all stages of bbh merger : inspiral , plunge , and ringdown .",
    "hence , it is particularly well suited for questions about how the final state depends on the initial state in bbh merger .",
    "by contrast , the post - newtonian approximation is an expansion of the einstein equations in @xmath16 , and treats bbhs as pairs of interacting point particles .",
    "it breaks down during the late stages of the merger  the last orbits , plunge , and ringdown , when the black holes begin to orbit with relativistic velocities and then cease to be two separate entities .",
    "since these late stages emit gravitational waves copiously , and play a crucial role in determining the properties of the final black hole , the post - newtonian formalism is _ not _ well suited for predicting the final state of bbh merger .",
    "( on the other hand , it is excellently suited for describing the binary and its gravitational - wave emission when the black holes are well separated and orbiting non - relativistically . )",
    "seventh , it is _ predictive_. as we show in detail in this paper , the spin expansion makes a host of detailed ( and successful ) quantitative predictions for the results of simulations .",
    "many of these predictions are new and distinct from the predictions of other analytical approaches .",
    "they reveal interesting features of the simulations that might not have been noticed otherwise .",
    "these predictions are _ derived _  they are not guesses .",
    "this is to be contrasted with expressions for the final kick velocity @xcite which were _ inspired _ by post - newtonian equations , but are ultimately empirical fitting formulae which are _ not _ derived . indeed ,",
    "if these formulae continued to hold in general , it would be quite amazing .",
    "they are linear in the initial spins , and we will highlight several effects which appear to be quintessentially non - linear in the spins , and hence _ not _ captured by the post - newtonian - inspired fitting formulae .    in this subsection , we have made an aggressive case for the merits of the spin expansion .",
    "we must also stress the obvious point that the spin expansion merely _ complements _ the other approaches to bbh merger  it does not replace them ! it should be clear that numerical simulations , post - newtonian techniques , and post - newtonian - inspired fitting formulae offer a huge amount of dynamical information and insights which can not be obtained from the spin expansion alone .",
    "nonetheless , the spin expansion provides unique understanding , as we hope will become clear in the course of this paper .",
    "the process of bbh merger is of great observational interest , since it is expected to govern the final evolution of both _ stellar - mass _ bbhs ( produced in stellar collapse ) and _ supermassive _ bbhs ( produced whenever galaxies merge ) .",
    "gravitational waves from merging stellar - mass bbhs are an important source for the ground - based detector ligo @xcite , while gravitational waves from merging supermassive bbhs are a primary source for the space - based detector lisa @xcite .",
    "these gravitational waves will provide unprecedented tests of strong - field general relativity , and open a new window onto exotic and previously invisible astrophysical phenomena .",
    "for example , after the two initial black holes form a common event horizon , they are predicted to `` ring down '' ( like a bell ) to a final quiescent kerr black hole .",
    "this ring - down signal is an important observable for future gravitational wave detectors , and may be thought of as a superposition of so - called `` quasi - normal modes . ''",
    "the observed spectrum of quasinormal modes depends on the quantities @xmath13 characterizing the final black hole , so the ability to predict these quantities may play an important role in interpreting these observations .",
    "the quantities @xmath17 characterizing the final black hole are also interesting astrophysically .",
    "these quantities may be probed observationally via the x - ray spectrum emitted from the inner edge of the accretion disk around a black hole . from the standpoint of _ supermassive _ bbh merger , they are believed to be linked to a variety of observables , including : ( _ i _ ) the quasar luminosity function @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) the location of a quasar with respect to its host galaxy @xcite ; ( _ iii _ ) the orientation and shape of jets in active galactic nuclei @xcite ; ( _ iv _ ) the correlation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion in the surrounding stellar bulge @xcite ; ( _ v _ ) the density profile in the centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "supermassive bbh merger is part of an interconnected web of astrophysical issues  the structure of this web is still poorly understood , and many fascinating questions remain .    finally ,",
    "since the present paper is concerned with the merger of _ spinning _ black holes , we should note that many  perhaps even _ most _  astrophysical black holes are indeed expected to have significant spin . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "black holes grown by gas accretion are expected to have spins near the maximum kerr limit @xcite .",
    "these predictions are supported by recent observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) by the x - ray observatory _ xmm - newton_. features in the fe - k@xmath18 line of the seyfert 1.2 galaxy mcg06 - 30 - 15 are best modeled by a black hole with kerr parameter @xmath19 at 90% confidence ( where @xmath20 would correspond to the maximal kerr value ) @xcite .",
    "other observations suggesting significant black hole spin include @xcite .",
    "while torques from accreting gas tend to align the orbital and spin angular momenta with the large - scale gas flow in gas - rich `` wet '' mergers @xcite , no such mechanisms exist in gas - poor `` dry '' mergers @xcite making studies of generic initial bbh spin configurations essential for understanding these systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : formalism ] we review the formalism of the spin expansion introduced in our _ letter _ @xcite .",
    "we use this formalism in sec .",
    "[ s : exact ] to identify several particularly symmetric initial spin configurations for which a subset of the final quantities @xmath21 _ identically _ vanish .",
    "these configurations may be useful to numerical relativists to help identify systematic errors in their codes that violate these symmetry constraints .",
    "we compare the predictions of our spin expansion to simulations of these configurations and some less symmetric ones in sec .",
    "[ approx ] .",
    "not only is the spin expansion _ consistent _ with all existing simulations , but it allows us to discover _ qualitatively new _",
    "non - linear effects by specifying the spin dependence these effects must take .",
    "these _ non - linear _ spin effects reveal the inadequacy of existing `` kidder '' fitting formulae for kick velocities @xcite modeled after the purely _ linear _ terms in post - newtonian expressions for the instantaneous loss of linear momentum .",

    ". will convince you that the spin expansion is powerfully explanatory and predictive when compared with existing simulations . ]",
    "imagine two black holes , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in a circular orbit , we will explain the extension of our formalism to non - circular ( eccentric ) orbits .",
    "] , as shown in fig .  [ triadfig ] .",
    "assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are initially far apart  far enough that they may be thought of as two kerr black holes , characterized by masses ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and spins ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "let us work in the center - of - momentum frame of the complete system ( including the gravitational radiation , and the momentum that it carries ) .",
    "the orbit gradually shrinks due to gravitational - wave emission , until @xmath22 and @xmath23 eventually merge .",
    "after the merger , the spacetime quickly settles down to a final kerr black hole with mass @xmath28 , spin @xmath29 , and recoil velocity ( or `` kick velocity '' ) @xmath1 relative to the center - of - momentum frame .",
    "next recall that classical general relativity has a trivial one - parameter rescaling symmetry .",
    "starting from a given solution , we can obtain another solution by rescaling every physical quantity @xmath30 according to its mass dimension @xmath31 : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an arbitrary positive number .",
    ", so that each physical quantity has units of mass to some power , called its `` mass dimension . '' for example",
    ", angular momentum has mass dimension @xmath34 , while distance and time both have mass dimension @xmath35 .",
    "] of course , rescaling the solution in this way is closely related to rescaling the basic unit of mass . for our purposes ,",
    "this freedom is more distracting than interesting : from now on , we will work exclusively with _",
    "_ quantities , which are unaffected by such a rescaling . in particular , it is useful to define the dimensionless initial mass ratio @xmath36 the dimensionless initial spins @xmath37 the dimensionless final mass @xmath38 and the dimensionless final spin @xmath39      to fully specify the initial configuration of this binary system , how much information do we need to provide ?    since we are only interested in dimensionless quantities , we can fully specify the initial state of the binary in terms of 8 numbers @xmath40 as follows .",
    "first choose an inspiral parameter @xmath41 , by which we mean a dimensionless quantity that varies monotonically along the orbit of the binary during the adiabatic inspiral phase .",
    "for example , @xmath41 could be the ( dimensionless ) orbital separation @xmath42 , or the ( dimensionless ) magnitude of the orbital angular momentum @xmath43 . at the `` initial instant '' ( _ i.e. _ at some particular value of @xmath41 ) , define an orthonormal triad @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 as shown in fig .",

    "now we can specify the initial state of the binary , at the initial instant @xmath41 , by giving 7 more numbers  namely the dimensionless mass ratio @xmath50 , and the initial spin components @xmath51 relative to the orthonormal triad .",

    "our presentation will hopefully be general enough to make it clear how to apply the same formalism to various other final quantities of interest , such as the ( dimensionless ) total radiated energy @xmath55 , or the ( dimensionless ) total radiated angular momentum @xmath56 .",

    "we will consider 3 simple transformations of the binary system : rotation `` @xmath59 , '' parity `` @xmath60 , '' and exchange `` @xmath30 . ''",

    "<S> in a recent paper @xcite , we introduced a spin expansion that provides a simple yet powerful way to understand aspects of binary black hole ( bbh ) merger . </S>",
    "<S> this approach relies on the symmetry properties of initial and final quantities like the black hole mass @xmath0 , kick velocity @xmath1 , and spin vector @xmath2 , rather than a detailed understanding of the merger dynamics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we expand on this proposal , examine how well its predictions agree with current simulations , and discuss several future directions that would make it an even more valuable tool . </S>",
    "<S> the spin expansion yields many new predictions , including several _ exact _ results that may be useful for testing numerical codes . some of these predictions have already been confirmed , while others await future simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we explain how a relatively small number of simulations  10 equal - mass simulations , and 16 unequal - mass simulations  may be used to calibrate all of the coefficients in the spin expansion up to second order at the minimum computational cost . for a more general set of simulations </S>",
    "<S> of given covariance , we derive the minimum - variance unbiased estimators for the spin expansion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how this calibration would be interesting and fruitful for general relativity and astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we sketch the extension to eccentric orbits . </S>"
