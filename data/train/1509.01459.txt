    "a point @xmath10 in the standard 3d cartesian system @xmath11 is naturally associated with a vector .",
    "the question arises : is it possible to represent the point @xmath12 by a hypercomplex number with three terms while keeping the basic properties of complex numbers , including the commutativity of addition and multiplication ?",
    "sir william r. hamilton , the famous irish mathematician , for many years had been trying to extend the algebra of complex numbers to 3d but failed to define the proper multiplication of triples . in 1853 he had published lectures on quaternions where four - terms numbers  were introduced instead ( they were discovered by hamilton earlier , in 1843 , though many believe that olinde rodrigues actually arrived at quaternions without naming as early as in 1840 ) . although the quaternions may describe a point in 4d space and form an associative division algebra over real numbers , they are not commutative under multiplication , and hence can not be really regarded as numbers .    in spite of all failing attempts by hamilton , we do have an intuitive conviction that if a point in a plane can be described by a two - term ( complex ) number , then there should exist a three - term - number to represent a point in the euclidean vector space @xmath13 .",
    "thus what we are looking for is a scalar that fulfills all associative , distributive and commutative laws that we normally require from numbers . in this paper",
    "we present such scalars , coined @xmath0-numbers , with an appropriate multiplication rule .",
    "they would imitate complex numbers by keeping a similar pattern with three components instead of two and having many similar properties . to describe the @xmath0-numbers and their multiplication , a geometric operator @xmath14 acting in @xmath13",
    "should be introduced first .",
    "let @xmath16 be a standard basis of the real euclidean vector space @xmath2 .",
    "motivated by the action of the imaginary unit @xmath17 ( regarded as a rotation operator in the complex plane ) we introduce @xmath14 , a _ geometric _ * operator * acting in @xmath2 .",
    "it is completely defined by the following transformation of the basis : @xmath18    let us explain the nature of this linear operator @xmath14 .",
    "first , being linear it transforms the origin @xmath19@xmath20 of the coordinate system into itself .",
    "second , given a real number @xmath21 that describes a distance of @xmath22 units along the @xmath23 axis , the quantity @xmath24 would represent the same distance along the @xmath25 axis , while @xmath26 is the distance @xmath22 on the @xmath27 axis .",
    "finally , @xmath28 will be the same distance on the @xmath23 axis but in the negative direction , i.e. , @xmath29 formally one can conclude that @xmath30 which reminds the famous formula for the imaginary unit : @xmath31 .",

    "i ve compiled this short bibliography which provides only a limited overview of hypercomplex - related field and contains several mathematical textbooks from shlomo s bookshelf .",

    "algebra @xmath4 of @xmath0-numbers is linked to geometry in three dimensions in a simple and natural way .",
    "based on shlomo s mostly elementary article , the advanced notions of invariant subspaces , idempotents , structured matrices , algebra isomorphism could be explained easily to undergraduate students via visualization in 3d space .",
    "the commutativity and useful analytical properties hopefully makes the @xmath0-numbers a valuable addition to the current toolbox of rotation matrices and quaternions for manipulating objects in 3d space , optimal tracking and robotic applications .",
    "there is also some evidence that the hypercomplex systems similar to @xmath0-numbers prove useful in cryptography , physics , digital signal processing , alignment of dna sequences , and study of the 3d structure of macromolecules .    the representation of entire @xmath2 as the @xmath3-product of a half - plane and a circle according to formula ( 3.20 ) might be advantageous .",
    "in particular , one can decompose any three - dimensional body like the stanford bunny ( in blue ) into the planar part ( in cyan ) and the arc ( in green ) and then manipulate ( e.g. , cluster or encrypt ) each component separately .",
