    "the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a large sample of strong gravitational lenses derived from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the lens sample has proved to be particularly useful due to the high quality of the data ; all of the slacs lenses have known lens and source redshifts , stellar velocity dispersions for the lensing galaxies have been measured from the sdss spectra , all of the systems have _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) acs imaging in two bands for accurate non - parametric lens modelling , and all of the sources are extended and therefore provide additional constraints on the mass profile of the lensing galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the density of background sources in the _ hst _ imaging allows a weak lensing analysis of the ensemble sample of lenses @xcite ; the major drawback of the lens sample is that it is unlikely to find any variable sources that would provide time delays .",
    "@xcite have used the slacs lenses to show that early - type galaxies have isothermal total inner density profiles with very little intrinsic scatter ( approximately 6 per cent ) assuming a uniformity in the environments of the lenses that has not been rigorously tested .",
    "while the slacs lenses seem to lie on the fundamental plane @xcite and do not differ noticeably from other sdss galaxies with similar luminosities and stellar velocity dispersions , the local environments of the lenses might affect the mass profiles of the lensing galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if some of the lenses are being perturbed by neighbouring galaxies the intrinsic scatter of the density slope for _ isolated _ early - type galaxies might be even smaller than 6 per cent .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that line - of - sight ( los ) contamination significantly affects the slacs lenses @xcite and the density slope might be expected to be shallower than originally reported .",
    "we report on a spectroscopic and photometric evaluation of the environments and lines of sight of the 15 slacs lenses investigated by @xcite .",
    "a weighting scheme is used to determine the effective number of potential perturbing companions to each lens galaxy .",
    "we also characterize the ` richness ' of the global environment of each lens field and quantify the number of galaxies along the los to the lens . throughout this paper the term ` global environment '",
    "is used to describe the group , cluster , or field in which the lens resides while the ` local environment ' describes the environment within @xmath0 h@xmath1kpc of the lensing galaxy .",
    "a @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath3 and @xmath4 is used to determine all physical distances , which are measured in h@xmath1units .",
    "our primary intent is to investigate a correlation between the inner density profile of the lensing galaxy and the galaxy s local environment .",
    "we therefore limit our sample to the subset of slacs lenses with published inner density slopes .",
    "this sample consists of 15 early - type galaxies with lens redshifts between @xmath5 and @xmath6 and stellar velocity dispersions from @xmath7 km  s@xmath1  to @xmath8 km  s@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the density slopes range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and the typical error on @xmath12 for a given system is approximately 5 per cent @xcite .",
    "four of the systems have shallower than isothermal density slopes ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) , six are approximately consistent with isothermal , and five lenses have steeper than isothermal profiles .",

    "however , @xmath30 is more robust as a binary indicator of whether there are any companions or not .",
    "our simulations show that 67 per cent of systems with @xmath36 have at least one spectroscopically confirmed companion , while 76 per cent of the systems with @xmath37 do not have any companions .",

    "neither of these can be quantified without spectroscopically defining the group membership ; we are only able to perform this analysis for the lowest redshift lenses ( section [ section_spectroscopy ] ) . nevertheless , we attempt to characterize the ` richness ' of the global environment by employing a weighting scheme similar to the one used for the local environment .",
    "the same colour distributions are used and the analysis only differs by the weight term used to penalize the radial offset from the lens ; the distance weighting for the global environment is @xmath42 with @xmath24 set to 350 h@xmath1kpc , approximately the virial radius for moderate redshift groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the group richness , @xmath43 , is the sum of all of the individual weights and is recorded in table [ table_lens_properties ] .",
    "while @xmath30 can be interpreted approximately as the number of neighbouring galaxies for each lens , @xmath43 should not be interpreted as the number of galaxies in the group , though it is a proxy for the density of early - type galaxies at a particular redshift .",
    "figure [ figure_comp_rich ] shows the distribution of richness for the slacs lenses and the sdss comparison sample ; a k - s test can not distinguish between the distributions .",
    "the lenses lie in typical environments and there is not a strong correlation between the global richness and the density slope for the slacs lenses .     for all of the sdss comparison fields ( black line ) and 14 of the slacs lenses .",

    "we use the sdss redshifts to determine group properties for these lens fields .",
    "there is one spectroscopically identified companion within 100 h@xmath1kpc of sdssj1330 - 0148 but no spectroscopic neighbours are found for the other two systems , tentatively confirming the binary interpretation of @xmath30 for these three systems .",
    "however , due to the inability to closely pack fibres on the sdss spectrograph , the local environments of these lenses are not completely probed spectroscopically .",
    "one of the systems , sdssj1420 + 6019 , appears to be isolated and no group is found to be associated with the lens . for the remaining two lens systems ,",
    "we determine the group velocity dispersion using the biweight estimate of the velocity distribution @xcite , and the lens offset is determined with respect to the median position of all identified group members ( table [ table_groups ] ) .",

    "we find that the global environments of the slacs lenses are typical of other massive early - type galaxies found in the sdss .",
    "two of the steeper than isothermal systems lie in very over - dense regions but the remaining lenses all have richness values that fall near the peak of the richness distribution ( figure [ figure_comp_rich ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the suggestion that the slacs lenses are affected by los contamination does not seem to be merited by the data .",
    "while there are other galaxies along the lines of sight to the lens systems , the los densities do not significantly deviate from the densities along comparable lines of sight .",
    "we therefore expect that the parameter estimates should not be affected as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the sdss photometric data indicate that the slacs lenses are only slightly more likely to be associated with companion galaxies than comparable lenses selected from the sdss , though the uncertainty of the photometric identifications makes the difference negligible .",
    "we therefore conclude that slacs lenses do lie in typical environments both globally and locally .",
    "however , we also find that lens systems with steeper than isothermal density slopes are preferentially associated with companion galaxies compared to lenses with shallower density slopes .",
    "n - body simulations suggest that interactions with neighbouring galaxies can induce a steepening in the density slope @xcite and there are other lens systems with companion galaxies that are found to be best modelled with steeper than isothermal profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the interaction - induced steepening is a transient effect and the density profile of the galaxy will return to isothermal approximately 0.5 - 2 gyr after the encounter with the neighbour @xcite .",
    "this may account for the large range of @xmath30 for lenses with nearly isothermal profiles ; isothermal lenses with a companion may be in the relaxed state before or after an encounter with the neighbour galaxy .",
    "this stripping mechanism may also account for local observations of dark matter deficient galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that one steeper - profile system , sdssj1250 + 0523 , is not photometrically associated with any neighbouring galaxies ; this perhaps illustrates the limits of using photometry to find perturbing companions or demonstrates that other factors also influence the slope of the density profile .",
    "additionally , we have not found an environmental bias to account for the shallower lenses .",
    "however , if a lens galaxy is embedded in a cluster , the joint profile of the cluster and galaxy would tend to be modelled with a shallower than isothermal profile if a single - component power law is used ( ignoring interactions between the two halos ) .",
    "this effect is dependent on the location of the lens with respect to the centre of the cluster , which our photometric analysis is unable to address .",
    "more complete field spectroscopy would better characterize the global environments of these lens systems and allow correlations between the mass slopes and cluster centre offsets to be investigated .",
    "furthermore , a spectroscopic investigation of the local environments of the complete sample of slacs early - type lenses would confirm the correlation indicated by our photometric analysis and provide strong evidence for truncation caused by galaxy interactions .",
