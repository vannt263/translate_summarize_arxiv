    "metamaterials consisting arrays of artificial particles usually work in the frequency regime in which the free - space wavelength is larger than the inter - particle distance by a factor around 10 .",
    "their electromagnetic properties can therefore be understood by treating a metamaterial as a homogeneous medium . more often , a local effective medium of permittivity ( @xmath0 ) and permeability ( @xmath1 ) is assumed to be valid .",
    "there are several approaches in obtaining the local effective medium of a metamaterial .",
    "one approach is the s - parameter retrieval method . @xcite it obtains the material parameters by comparing the transmission and the reflection coefficients of a slab of metamaterial and the corresponding homogeneous slab .",
    "another approach relies on a homogenization theory which averages the microscopic field by line and area integrals . @xcite both approaches can cater for complex geometry and microstructure of the metamaterial and they work very well at frequencies far away from the resonance gap where spatial dispersion becomes important so that higher order eigenmodes ( including the non - propagating ones ) can be excited inside the metamaterial .",
    "@xcite in this work , we will take another approach to deal with the spatial dispersion at a frequency near the resonance gap . instead of picking or assuming a dominant eigenmode within the metamaterial",
    ", we will find the non - local effective medium directly for an arbitrary bloch wave vector @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the permittivity @xmath3 now depends on both the angular frequency @xmath4 and the wave vector .",
    "apart from working near the resonance gap , some metamaterials like the wire medium , @xcite the three - dimensional wire mesh @xcite and the structured metal surface @xcite also indicate that spatial dispersion ( the non - local effective medium ) can become important in order to have an accurate description of the metamaterial . in this paper",
    ", we will establish a numerical scheme in getting the non - local effective medium and some effects of spatial dispersion on metamaterial will be examined .",
    "section [ sect2 ] outlines the numerical scheme in obtaining the non - local effective medium . we will employ a dipolar model for simplicity .",
    "it has the advantage that analytic formulas can be obtained in some cases .",
    "moreover , all the material parameters , two tensors ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) together with two pseudo tensors ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) can be obtained easily in the whole frequency regime .",
    "all the four constitutive tensors will be extracted as ref . and pointed out that a metamaterial should be described as a bianisotropic medium if the artificial atoms suffer from cross - coupling ( electric field generates magnetic dipole and/or magnetic field generates electric dipole ) .    in section [ sect3 ] , the local effective medium of a double - lattice metamaterial will be first examined .",
    "one sublattice consists of electric artificial atoms and another sublattice consists of magnetic artificial atoms .",
    "the condition that the local effective medium becoming free of bianisotropy will be discussed .    in the last section , the non - local effective medium of the double - lattice metamaterial will be examined .",
