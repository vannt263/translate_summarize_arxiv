    "vlbi imaging at millimeter wavelengths ( mm - vlbi ) gives highest angular resolution and facilitates direct studies of the self - absorbed jet base in agn . for 3c273 ( @xmath1 ) images with an angular resolution of up to @xmath2@xmath3as ( 1@xmath3as @xmath4arcsec )",
    "are made at 86ghz .",
    "this corresponds to a spatial scale of @xmath5 schwarzschild radii ( for m @xmath6 m ) .",
    "the small observing beam allows to accurately determine positions of jet components .",
    "this facilitates detailed studies of the jet structure and kinematics near the nucleus , in particular with regard to the broad - band ( radio to gamma - ray ) flux density variability and the birth of new ` vlbi components ' .",
    "here we summarize new results from our multi epoch ( 1990  1997 ) and high observing frequency ( 15 , 22 , 43 and 86ghz ) vlbi monitoring .",
    "at sub - milliarcsecond resolution , 3c273 shows a one sided core - jet structure of several milliarcseconds length .",
    "the jet breaks up into multiple vlbi components , which  when represented by gaussian components  seem to separate at apparent superluminal speeds from the stationary assumed vlbi core .",
    "the cross - identification of the model - fit components , seen at different times and epochs , is facilitated by small ( @xmath7mas ) , and to first order negligible , opacity shifts of the component positions relative to the vlbi - core .",
    "quasi - simultaneous data sets ( cf .",
    "1 ) demonstrate convincingly the reliability of the component identification , which results in a kinematic scenario , in which all detected jet components ( c6  c18 ) move steadily ( without ` jumps ' in position ) away from the core ( fig .",
    "4 ) . for the components with enough data points at small ( @xmath8mas ) and large ( @xmath9mas ) core separations , quadratic fits to the radial motion r(t )",
    "( but also for x(t ) right ascension , and y(t ) declination ) represent the observations much better than linear fits .",
    "thus the components seem to accelerate as they move out .",
    "the velocities range typically from @xmath10 ( for ) .",

    ", 43ghz ( center ) , and 86ghz ( bottom ) observed in 1995.15  1995.18 .",
    "contour levels are -0.5 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , 50 , 70 , and 90% of the peak of 3.0 ( top ) , 5.4 ( center ) , and 4.7jy / beam ( bottom ) . for the 22ghz map ,",
    "the 0.5% contour is omitted .",
    "the restoring beam is @xmath11mas in size , oriented at @xmath12 .",
    "the maps are centered on the eastern component ( the core ) , the dashed lines guide the eye and help to identify corresponding jet components .      fig .  2 : spectral index variations along the jet . for 1997 ( circles , solid lines ) ,",
    "the spectral index gradient is calculated directly from the intensity profiles of the maps at 15 and 86ghz . for 1995 ( squares , dashed line ) ,",
    "the spectral indices were derived from gaussian component model fits at 22 and 86ghz .",
    "we note that during the time interval 1995  1997 , different jet components occupied this jet region . the spectral profile along the jet , however , did not change significantly .",

    "symbols denote for different epochs : 1995.54 ( circles ) , 1996.94 ( squares ) , 1997.04 ( diamonds ) , and 1997.19 ( triangles ) .",
    "the transverse oscillations of the ridge line are measured relative to a straight line oriented along @xmath13 .",
    "we note the systematic longitudinal displacement of maxima and minima .",
    "this corresponds to an apparent pattern velocity of @xmath14 , which is by a factor of up to 2 slower than the component motion .",
    "dual - frequency maps obtained in 1995 ( 22/86ghz ) and 1997 ( 15/86ghz ) allow to measure the spectral index gradient along the jet ( see fig .",
    "the spectrum oscillates between @xmath15 ( ) .",
    "most noteworthy , the spectral gradients did not change significantly over the 2 year time period , although different jet components occupied this jet region .",
    "thus , the geometrical ( eg .",
    "relativistic aberration ) and/or the physical environment ( pressure , density , b - field ) in the jet must determine the observed properties of the vlbi components .",
    "hence , the latter do not form ` physical entities ' , but seem to react to the physical conditions of the jet fluid .",
    "further evidence for a fluid dynamical interpretation comes from a study of the mean jet axis and the transverse width of the jet .",
    "both oscillate quasi - sinusoidally on mas - scales . at 15ghz",
    ", the variation of the ridge - line with time could be determined from 4 vlba maps obtained during 1995  1997 ( fig .",
    "the maxima and minima of the ridge - line are systematically displaced .",
    "this ` longitudinal ' shift suggests motion with a pattern velocity of @xmath16 .",
    "the sinusoidal curvature of the jet axis , however , is more indicative for jet rotation rather than for longitudinal waves .",
    "helical kelvin - helmholtz instabilities propagating in the jet sheath could mimic such rotation , which , when seen in projection , would explain also the spectral index oscillation in figure 2 .      for many agn , a correlation between flux density variability and ejection of vlbi components is suggested . in 3c273",
    "we identified 13 jet components ( c6  c18 ) and traced their motion back to their ejection from the vlbi core . the typical measurement uncertainty for the ejection times @xmath17 ranges between 0.2  0.5yr . in figure 5 ( left )",
    "we plot @xmath17 and the millimeter - variability ( 22  230ghz )",
    ". we also add the gamma - ray detections of 3c273 from egret . in figure 5 ( right )",
    "we plot the onset times of the mm - flares derived from these light curves ( trler et al .",
    "1999 ) together with the vlbi ejection time ( @xmath17 ) and the gamma - ray fluxes . for each onset of a mm - flare",
    ", we find that a new jet component was ejected .",
    "although the time sampling of the gamma - ray data is quite coarse , a relation between component ejection and high gamma - ray flux appears very likely ( note that each gamma - detection already means higher than usual @xmath18-brightness ) . from a more detailed analysis ( krichbaum et al .",
    "2001 ) we obtain for the time lag between component ejection and onset of a mm - flare : @xmath19yr .",
    "if we assume that the observed peaks in the gamma - ray light - curve are located near the times @xmath20 of flux density maxima , we obtain @xmath21yr .",
    "although the gamma - ray variability may be faster , this result is fully consistent with the more general finding of enhanced gamma - ray fluxes mainly during the rising phase of millimeter flares .",
    "we therefore suggest the following tentative sequence of events : @xmath22  the onset of a millimeter flare is followed by the ejection of a new vlbi component and , either simultaneously or slightly time - delayed , an increase of the gamma - ray flux .",
    "if we focus only on those vlbi components , which were ejected close to the main maxima of the gamma - ray light - curve in figure 5 , we obtain time lags of @xmath23 of @xmath24yr for c12 , @xmath25yr for c13 , @xmath26yr for c16 and @xmath27yr for c18 . in all cases",
    "the gamma - rays seem to peak a little later than the time of component ejection . with @xmath28 near the core , the gamma - rays would then escape at a radius @xmath29mas .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath30 schwarzschild radii ( for a @xmath31 mblack hole ) or @xmath32 cm , consistent with theoretical expectations , in which gamma - rays escape the horizon of photon - photon pair production at separations of a few hundred to a few thousand schwarzschild radii .",
