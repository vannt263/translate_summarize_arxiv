    "recently , for the study of a new class of local or graded rings which are cohen  macaulay but not gorenstein , _ almost gorenstein _ local or graded rings were defined and have been studied . in this paper , for the further study of almost gorenstein rings , we concentrate on almost gorenstein homogeneous rings and investigate the @xmath0-vectors of almost gorenstein homogeneous rings .    originally , the notion of almost gorenstein local rings of dimension one was introduced by barucci and frberg @xcite in the case where the local rings are analytically unramified . after this work , goto , matsuoka and phuong @xcite modified the definition of one - dimensional almost gorenstein local rings , which also works well in the case where the rings are analytically ramified . as a further investigation of almost gorenstein local rings , the definition of almost gorenstein local or graded rings of higher dimension suggested by goto , takahashi and taniguchi @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the detailed information on almost gorenstein rings .",

    "this is a necessary condition for @xmath3 $ ] to be almost gorenstein ( with @xmath5-invariant 0 ) .",
