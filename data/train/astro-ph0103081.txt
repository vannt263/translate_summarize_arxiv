    "since the discovery of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their nature has proved enigmatic .",
    "the cgro and batse observations demonstrated they were isotropically distributed on the sky @xcite , which could either have been explained by galactic @xcite or cosmological @xcite spatial distributions .",
    "the bepposax satellite @xcite contributed the breakthrough in this field by providing rapid localizations of the x - ray afterglow of a grb to a precision of several arcminutes .",
    "such precision allowed for rapid optical @xcite and radio @xcite identifications of transients associated with individual grbs .",
    "the identification of the optical transient ( ot ) associated with grb  970508 @xcite led to the first optical spectroscopic redshift determination for a grb , placing it at @xmath7 @xcite , and thus firmly at a cosmological distance .    despite such rapid progress and intensive followup campaigns at many wavelengths , only some grbs",
    "have had associated x - ray , optical or radio afterglows , and all of these events have been among the `` long - duration '' grb population @xcite . of these , only @xmath815 have had unambiguous spectroscopic redshift identification ( see those to date tabulated by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the primary difficulty is the combined delays imposed by the time necessary to improve the x - ray localizations , interruption of a telescope observing program to obtain optical imaging data , reduction and analysis of those data relative to poss images to identify the ot , and interruption of another telescope observing program to obtain a spectrum ( usually on a different telescope , since there are very few combined imaging and spectrograph instruments ) . by the time a spectrum is taken , the ot has usually faded significantly , generally limiting such followup observations to only the largest available ground - based optical telescopes or the hubble space telescope . furthermore , observational conditions may not be optimal immediately after a grb event , such that only approximately half of the known grb redshifts were obtained with spectroscopy of the ot itself  the others were obtained at later times from the presumptive host galaxy , after the ot had faded .    here",
    "we report the rapid identification of an ot associated with grb  010222 , and the spectroscopy of the source within five hours after the grb occured .",
    "the quick localization of the x - ray and optical transients allowed for spectroscopic observations on a modest 1.5  m telescope , the smallest aperture telescope to measure the redshift of a grb to date .",
    "grb  010222  was detected by the gamma - ray burst monitor and wide field camera 1 instruments on board bepposax at 07:23:30 ut on 2001 february 22 @xcite .",
    "an optical transient ( ot ) associated with grb  010222was reported within several hours by @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided independent confirmation of the ot from images taken with the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2  m telescope and 4shooter ccd mosaic camera @xcite .",
    "the identification of the ot ( @xmath9 = @xmath10 , @xmath11 = @xmath12 , j2000.0 ) on these latter discovery images is shown in figure  [ fig - finding ] .",
    "a spectrum of the ot was obtained with the flwo 1.5  m tillinghast telescope beginning at ut 2001 february 22 12:18 , 4.92 hours after the burst .",
    "the ot apparent magnitude was @xmath0  mag around the time of the spectroscopy @xcite . despite the faintness of the ot , it was visible on the telescope acquisition camera , such that it could unambiguously identified and placed on the spectrograph slit .",
    "the observations were made with the fast spectrograph @xcite using a 3  arcsec wide slit and 300 l / mm grating , yielding 6   fwhm resolution over the range @xmath13  .",
    "two 1200s exposures were taken with the slit rotated to the parallactic angle ( and moreover the airmass was @xmath141.04 ) , reduced in the standard manner with an optimal extraction @xcite , and combined .",
    "wavelength calibration was provided via henear lamp spectra taken immediately after the ot exposures , with minor adjustment based on night sky lines in the ot frames .",
    "we corrected for telluric lines @xcite and flux - calibrated the spectra with exposures of the spectrophotometric standard star hiltner 600 @xcite , also taken at the parallactic angle , yielding relative fluxes in our ot spectrum accurate to @xmath85% over the observed wavelength range .",
    "the discovery spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig - spectrum1 ] , and preliminary results from it have been reported previously @xcite .",
    "four additional spectra of @xmath15  s each were obtained the following night ( ut 2001 february 23 ) when the ot had faded by @xmath81.5 to 2  mag @xcite .",
    "the dispersed spectrum was at the detection threshold of the spectrograph , hence no reliable results could be obtained from these data .",
    "the optical spectrum of grb  010222  in figure  [ fig - spectrum1 ] shows a blue continuum that is typical for grbs . superimposed upon this continuum",
    "are a number of strong and weak absorption line systems at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are identified by the metallic lines of , , , , , , , , and .",
    "two additional lines are tentatively identified with at @xmath18 because these lines are weaker and no other lines are found at a similar redshift ( although the s / n is worse at these shorter wavelengths ) .",
    "all three systems were independently detected by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite from spectroscopy at the keck observatory .",
    "our line identifications are summarized in table  [ table - line - ids ] ; as is typical for metal - line absorption systems , the lines are the strongest in the spectrum , nearly reaching zero flux for the highest redshift system even at this relatively low spectral resolution .",

    "furthermore , the non - detection of ly@xmath9 forest absorption or continuum decrement at @xmath20   would suggest the grb host is at @xmath21 , though this is not a firm constraint given the s / n ratio of the data . if the highest - redshift lines are from the grb host itself , then the grb is at @xmath1 .",
    "several other grb ots have shown absorption line systems which have been argued to arise from the ism of the grb host galaxy : grb  090508 @xcite , grb  980703 @xcite , grb  990123 @xcite , grb  990510 and grb  990712 @xcite , and grb  991216 @xcite .    while absorption systems are commonly found along the line - of - sight to distant qsos , the three detected at @xmath22    corresponding to a redshift interval of @xmath23 , or @xmath24is significantly larger than the mean of @xmath25 @xcite . moreover , that value was derived based on systems with a @xmath262796 rest - frame equivalent width @xmath27  , measured with generally similar spectral resolution as the observations presented here . though our detection threshhold for this line is difficult to determine a priori , it is likely at least 0.6  , and @xcite find an average of @xmath28 for systems with such strong absorption ( @xmath29  ) .",
    "thus , there is quite a discrepancy between the expectation of @xmath80.7 systems over the observed wavelength region compared to the 3 systems actually detected .",
    "this discrepancy would be mitigated if the @xmath1 system were the host galaxy of the grb .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 system has an unusually large rest - frame equivalent width of the @xmath26 2796   line of @xmath30   , which is larger than all 111 systems found by @xcite . the @xmath31 system equivalent width places it in the top 10% , while the @xmath32 system is more typical .",
    "the doublet ratios @xmath33 are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for systems with redshifts of 1.477 , 1.157 , and 0.928 , respectively ; these values are typical of the anticorrelation between @xmath37 and the doublet ratio , indicating the lines are strongly saturated @xcite .",
    "the and equivalent widths for the @xmath5 system are likewise unusually strong @xcite .",
    "since these absorption line strengths for the @xmath5 are so large , either the impact parameter is extremely small or this system represents the ot host galaxy .",
    "nearly all of the absorption line systems in grb ots show substantially weaker lines than the @xmath5 system ( the host of grb  990712 is the lone exception , with an equivalent width of @xmath38   ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) further strengthening the case that the high - redshift system is the ot host .    to make these arguments more quantitative , we calculate the bayesian odds ratio for the following two hypotheses ( assumed to be equally likely a priori ) : @xmath39 , that the ot is at redshift @xmath40 with three foreground absorption systems , and @xmath41 , that the ot is at redshift @xmath1 with two foreground absorption systems . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the redshift path - length for detection of absorption systems is our full spectral window , , because the spectral window for detecting foreground is less than our observed wavelength range if the ot redshift is @xmath42 .",
    "this only strengthens the argument presented . ]",
    "@xmath24 , implying , as above , an expectation of @xmath43 absorption systems , assuming a detection threshold of @xmath44   @xcite . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the redshift path has an upper bound at @xmath1 , yielding @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the observed number of systems follows a simple poisson distribution , and so the bayesian odds @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 = 3.4 $ ] , indicating that @xmath41 is more than three times as likely as @xmath39 under the given assumptions .",
    "in addition to the _ number _ of observed absorption systems , we can also take into account their _ strength _",
    ", by adopting the @xmath262796 equivalent width distribution function of @xcite , @xmath49 with @xmath50 = 0.66   ( a good fit to the data for @xmath51 0.6  , our detection threshhold seems to change with redshift , whereas we have assumed it to be fixed over the redshift range @xmath52 .",
    "however , we do not expect significant changes in the results taking this evolution into account , because the mean redshift of the absorber population that @xcite used to derive @xmath53 , @xmath54 , well matches our observable redshift range . ] ) . because of the rarity of absorption systems as strong as the one detected at @xmath1 , incorporating the line strengths into the calculation increases the bayesian odds favoring @xmath41 over @xmath39 to 28:1 .",
    "thus , there is strong support for the identification of the @xmath1 system as the host of grb  010222 .    beyond the absorption systems along the line of sight",
    ", we also use the observed spectrum to measure the spectral power - law index of the ot .",
    "the continuum flux is overwhelmingly dominated by the ot , so contamination from an underlying host or other objects on the slit is negligible . after correcting for galactic extinction , @xmath55 mag @xcite , adopting a standard @xmath56 extinction law @xcite , we bin the spectrum into ten segments ( excluding the absorption lines ) , using the rms deviation in each bin as an estimate of the uncertainty , as shown in figure  [ fig - continuum ] .",
    "we have adjusted the normalization to match the concurrent photometry @xcite .",
    "a least squares minimization yields a power law index @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , additional uncertainty due to the relative flux calibration is likely to be small .",
    "the spectral slope is rather steep in comparison to early observations of other bright grb afterglows .",
    "for example grb  990510 had a @xmath59 less than one day after the burst @xcite and grb  991216 had @xmath60 after a correction for large galactic extinction @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , grb  000926 exhibited a very steep spectral slope with an index of 1.5 which was attributed to significant dust extinction along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the steep spectral slope for grb  010222  may also indicate significant extinction from dust in the host galaxy .",
    "furthermore , jet models by @xcite predict a shallower spectral index than we observe given the reported light curve decline rates ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also suggesting significant extinction .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig - continuum ] , the spectrum exhibits no clear evidence for the @xmath262175    `` bump '' , typical of galactic interstellar dust @xcite , which falls in the observed spectral region for @xmath5 . such a feature would be easily detectable even at levels @xmath61 mag .",
    "thus we conclude that there is no significant extinction from galactic - type dust in the @xmath62 absorption system .",
    "however , substantial extinction from dust with an extinction law like that found in the smc could still account for the steep spectral slope , as such dust does not show a significant @xmath262175   feature @xcite",
    ". an smc - like extinction curve may be a more natural choice if grbs come from young stellar environments , since dust in starburst galaxies tends to lack the @xmath262175   bump @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to the entire bepposax team for the quick turnaround in providing precise grb positions to the astronomical community , as well as to scott barthelmy and the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) . that these results could be obtained with small aperture telescopes is entirely due to the speed in which positions are reported and disseminated ."
