    "despite the fact that the first order phase transition in the ion collisions is widely discussed both from theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite points of view the feeling of some dissatisfaction nevertheless remain . to all appearance the main problem consists in absence of the single - meaning directly measurable ( `` order '' ) parameter(s ) which may confirm this phenomenon in the high energy experiment .",
    "our aim is to offer such parameter , explain its physical meaning and to show how it can be measured .",
    "we guess that to observe first order phase transition it is necessary to consider very high multiplicity ( vhm ) processes .",
    "then in this multiplicity region exist following parameter : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the normalized to unite multiplicity distribution which can be considered in the vhm region as the `` partition function '' of the @xmath2 system , see appendix , and @xmath3 is the mean energy of produced particles , i.e. @xmath3 is associated with temperature . continuing the analogy with thermodynamics one can say that @xmath4 is the gibbs free energy per one particle",
    ". then @xmath5 can be interpreted as the `` chemical potential '' measured with help of @xmath6 particles as the multiplicity in the experimentally observable range of phase space . ] in a free state .",
    "we assume that the system obey the equilibrium condition , i.e. produced particles energy distribution can be described with high accuracy by boltzmann exponent , or , it is the same , the inequality ( ) must be satisfied .",
    "this assumption defines the `` vhm region '' @xcite  .",
    "it must be underlined that existence of the `` good '' parameter @xmath3 does not assumes that the whole system is thermally equilibrium , i.e. the energy spectrum of unobserved particles may be arbitrary in our `` inclusive '' description .",
    "the definition ( ) is quiet general .",
    "it can be used both for hadron - hadron and ion - ion collisions , both for low and high energies .",
    "it is model free and operates only with `` external '' directly measurable parameters .",
    "the single indispensable condition : we work in the @xmath7 region of observed particles .",
    "it is evident that such generality has definite defect : measuring @xmath5 one can not say something about details of the process .",
    "this `` defect '' have following explanation .",
    "the point is that the classical theory of phase transitions have dealing immediately with the @xmath8 properties of media in which the transition occur .",
    "but in our , `` @xmath9-matrix '' , case one can examine only the @xmath10 response on the phase transition in the form of created mass - shell particles .    continuing the analogy with the boiling",
    ", we are trying to define the boiling by the number of evaporating particles .",
    "the effect is evidently seen if the number of such particles is very large , i.e. in the vhm case .",
    "the `` order parameter '' is the work needed for one particle production , i.e. coincides with the `` chemical potential '' . in the boiled `` two - phase '' region",
    "the media is unstable against `` evaporation '' of particles , i.e. the chemical potential must decrease with number of produced particles .",
    "we offer quantitative answers on the following three question .",
    "\\(a ) _ in what case one _ may _ observe first order phase transition . _ + we will argue that observation of vhm states are necessary to find phase transition phenomenon .",
    "first of all the energy of produced particles are small in vhm case .",
    "this means that the kinetic degrees of freedom does not play essential role , i.e. they can not destroy , wipe out , the phase transition phenomenon .",
    "the second reason is connected with observation that in the vhm region one may use such equilibrium thermodynamics parameters as the temperature @xmath11 , chemical potential @xmath12 and so on .",
    "\\(b ) _ what we can measure . _",
    "+ we will see that in vhm region exist the estimation ( ) where all quantities in r.h.s .",
    "are measurables .",
    "\\(c ) _ what kind effect one may expect . _",
    "+ chemical potential , @xmath12 , by definition is the work which is necessary to introduce , i.e. to produce , one particle into the system @xcite  .",
    "if the first order pase transition occurs then @xmath12 must decrease with @xmath13 in the two - phase ( `` boiling '' ) region .",
    "it is our general conclusion which will be explained using lattice gas model .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we will start from simple generalization of well known formulae . let us consider the generating function @xmath14 for sake of simplicity @xmath1 is normalized so that @xmath15 one may use inverse mellin transformation : @xmath16 to find @xmath1 if @xmath17 is known . noting",
    "that @xmath1 have sharp maximum over @xmath13 near mean multiplicity @xmath18 one may calculate integral ( ) by saddle point method .",
    "the equation : @xmath19 defines mostly essential value @xmath20 .",
    "notice that @xmath21 if the hadron multiplicity @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the characteristic mass of hadron . production of identical particles is considered for sake of simplicity .",
    "therefore , only @xmath24 have the physical meaning .",
    "one may write @xmath17 in the form : @xmath25 where the mayer group coefficient @xmath26 can be expressed through @xmath27-particle correlation function ( binomial moments ) @xmath28 : @xmath29 let us assume now that in the sum : @xmath30 one may leave first term .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath31 are essential and in the vhm region @xmath32 therefore , in considered case with @xmath33 exist following asymptotic estimation for @xmath34 : @xmath35 i.e. @xmath1 is defined in vhm region mainly by the solution of eq .",
    "( ) and the correction can not change this conclusion . it will be shown that this kind of estimation is hold for arbitrary asymptotics of @xmath1 .",
    "if we understand @xmath1 as the `` partition function '' in the vhm region then @xmath36 is the @xmath37 usually introduced in statistical physics if the number of particles is not conserved .",
    "correspondingly the chemical potential @xmath5 is defined trough @xmath36 : @xmath38 combining this definition with estimation ( ) we define @xmath1 through @xmath5 .",
    "but , if this estimation does not depend from the asymptotics of @xmath1 , it can be used for definition of @xmath12 through @xmath39 and @xmath11 .",
    "just this idea is realized in ( ) .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    now we will make the important step . to put in a good order our intuition",
    "it is useful to consider @xmath17 as the @xmath40 function of @xmath36 . in statistical physics",
    "the thermodynamical limit is considered for this purpose . in our case",
    "the finiteness of energy @xmath41 and of the hadron mass @xmath23 put obstacles on this way since the system of produced particles necessarily belongs to the energy - momentum surface .",
    "but we can continue theoretically @xmath1 to the range @xmath42 and consider @xmath17 as the nontrivial function of @xmath36 .    let us consider the analog generating function which has the first @xmath43 coefficient of expansion over @xmath36 equal to @xmath1 and higher coefficients for @xmath44 are deduced from continuation of theoretical value of @xmath1 to @xmath44 .",
    "then the inverse mellin transformation ( ) gives a good estimation of @xmath1 through this generating function if the fluctuations near @xmath45 are gaussian or , it is the same , if @xmath46 notice that if the estimation ( ) is generally rightful then one can easily find that l.h.s .",
    "of ( ) is @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , one may consider @xmath17 as the nontrivial function of @xmath36 considering @xmath48 if @xmath49 .",
    "then it is easily deduce that the asymptotics of @xmath39 is defined by the leftmost singularity , @xmath50 , of in this way generalized function @xmath17 since , as it follows from ( ) , the singularity `` attracts '' the solution @xmath45 _ in the vhm region_. in result , we may classify asymptotics of @xmath1 in the vhm region if ( ) is hold .    thus our problem is reduced to the definition of possible location of leftmost singularity of @xmath17 over @xmath51 .",
    "it must be stressed that the character of singularity is not important for definition of @xmath12 in the vhm region at least with @xmath52 accuracy .",
    "one may consider only three possibility : at @xmath53    \\(a ) @xmath54 ,    \\(b ) @xmath55 ,    \\(c ) @xmath56 .",
    "other possibilities are nonphysical or extremely rear .",
    "correspondingly one may consider only three type of asymptotics in the vhm region :    \\(a ) @xmath57 .",
    "we will see that in this case the isotropic momentum distribution must be observed , i.e. the energy , @xmath58 , distribution in this case is boltzmann - like , @xmath59 ;    \\(b ) @xmath60 .",
    "such asymptotics is typical for hard processes with large transverse momenta , like for jets @xcite  ;    \\(c ) @xmath61 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is typical for multiperipheral - like kinematics , where the longitudinal momenta of produced particles are noticeably higher than the transverse ones @xcite  .",
    "we are forced to assume that the energy is sufficiently large , i.e. @xmath62 is sufficiently close to @xmath50 . in",
    "opposite case the singularity would not be `` seen '' on experiment .",
    "our aim is to give physical interpretation of this three asymptotics .",
    "the idea , as it follows from previous discussion , is simple : one must explain the nature of singularity @xmath50 .",
    "it must be noted at the same time that in the equilibrium thermodynamics exist only two possibility , ( a ) and ( c ) @xcite and just the case ( a ) corresponds to the first order phase transition .    summarizing the results we conclude : _",
    "if the energy is sufficiently large , i.e. if @xmath62 is sufficiently close to @xmath50 , if the multiplicity is sufficiently large , so that ( ) is satisfied and @xmath45 can be sufficiently close to @xmath50 , then one may have confident answer on the question : exist or not first order phase transition in hadron collisions .",
    "_    it must be noted here that the heavy ion collisions are the most candidates since @xmath50 is easer distinguishable in this case .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the temperature @xmath3 is the another problem .",
    "the temperature is introduced usually using kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) periodic boundary conditions @xcite  . but this way assumes from the very beginning that the system ( a ) is equilibrium @xcite and ( b ) is surrounded by thermostat through which the temperature is determined .",
    "the first condition ( a ) we take as the simplification which gives the equilibrium state where the time ordering in the particle production process is not important and therefore the time may be excluded from consideration .",
    "the second one ( b ) is the problem since there is no thermostat in particle physics .",
    "for this reason we introduce the temperature as the lagrange multiplier @xmath63 of energy conservation law @xcite  . in such approach the condition that the system is in equilibrium with thermostat replaced by the condition that the fluctuations in vicinity of @xmath64 are gaussian .",
    "the interesting for us @xmath65 we define through inverse laplace transform of @xmath66 : @xmath67 it is known @xcite that if the interaction radii is finite then the equation ( of state ) : @xmath68 have real positive solution @xmath69 at @xmath20 .",
    "we will assume that the fluctuations near @xmath70 are gaussian .",
    "this means that the inequality @xcite  : @xmath71 is satisfied .",
    "therefore , we prepare the formalism to find thermodynamic description of the processes of particle production assuming that this @xmath9-matrix conditions of equilibrium ( ) and ( ) are hold allows to describe the system of large number of degrees of freedom in terms of single parameter , i.e. it is nothing but the useful trick . it is no way for this reason to identify entirely @xmath72 with thermodynamic temperature where it has self - contained physical sense . ] .",
    "we want to underline that our thermal equilibrium condition ( ) have absolute meaning : if it is not satisfied then @xmath69 loses every sense since the expansion in vicinity of @xmath69 leads to the asymptotic series . in this case only the dynamical description of @xmath9-matrix can be used .",
    "it is not hard to see @xcite that @xmath73 is the @xmath74-point energy correlator , where @xmath75 means averaging over all events with given multiplicity and energy .",
    "therefore ( ) means `` relaxation of @xmath74-point correlations '' , @xmath76 , measured in units of the dispersion of energy fluctuations , @xmath77 .",
    "one can note here the difference of our definition of thermal equilibrium from thermodynamical one @xcite  .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    let us consider now the estimation ( ) .",
    "it follows from ( ) that , up to the preexponential factor , @xmath78 we want to show that , in a vide range of n from vhm area , @xmath79 let as consider now the mostly characteristic examples .",
    "\\(a ) _ singularity at @xmath80_. + this case will be considered in sec.3 . in the used lattice gas approximation @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( b ) _ singularity at @xmath83 _ : + @xmath84 . in this case @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xmath87 ( c ) _ singularity at @xmath88 _ : @xmath89 .",
    "+ in this case @xmath90 and @xmath91 one can conclude :    \\(i ) the definition ( ) in the vhm region is rightful since the correction falls down with @xmath13 . on this stage",
    "we can give only the estimation of correction but ( ) gives the correct @xmath13 dependence .",
    "\\(ii ) activity @xmath45 tends to @xmath50 from the right in the case ( a ) and from the left if we have the case(b ) or ( c ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the accuracy of estimation of the `` chemical potential '' ( ) increase from ( c ) to ( a ) .",
    "the physical meaning of singularity over @xmath36 @xcite may be illustrated by following simple model . as was mentioned above the singularity at @xmath80",
    "is interpreted as the first order phase transition .",
    "therefore , let us assume @xcite that @xmath64 is so large that interacting particles strike together into clusters ( drops ) .",
    "then the mayer s group coefficient for the cluster from @xmath74 particle is @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , is the surface tension energy , @xmath95 is the dimension .",
    "therefore , if @xmath96 the series over @xmath74 in ( ) diverges at al @xmath97 . at the same time , the sum ( ) converge for @xmath98 .",
    "we consider following analog model to describe condensation phenomenon in the particle production processes .",
    "let us cover the space around interaction point by the net assuming that if the particle hit the knot we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 in opposite case .",
    "this `` lattice gas '' model @xcite has a good description in terms of ising model @xcite  .",
    "we may regulate number of down oriented `` spins '' , i.e. the number of produced particles , by external magnetic field @xmath101 .",
    "therefore the `` activity '' @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath103 is the `` chemical potential '' @xcite  .",
    "calculation of the partition function means summation over all spin configurations with constraint @xmath104 . here",
    "the ergodic hypothesis is used .",
    "it allows to exclude the time from consideration .    to have the continuum model we may spread normally the @xmath105-function of this constraint @xcite  : @xmath106 therefore , the grand partition function of the model in the continuum limit looks as follows @xcite  : @xmath107 where the action @xmath108 the structure of contributions in ( ) essentially depends on the sign of constant @xmath58 , see fig.1 where the case @xmath109 is shown .",
