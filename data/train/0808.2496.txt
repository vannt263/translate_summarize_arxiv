    "non - associative algebras may surely be called beautiful mathematical entities .",
    "however , they have never been systematically utilized in physics , only some attempts have been made toward this goal . nevertheless , there are some intriguing hints that non - associative algebras may play essential role in the ultimate theory , yet to be discovered",
    ".    octonions are one example of a non - associative algebra .",
    "it is known that they form the largest normed algebra after the algebras of real numbers , complex numbers , and quaternions @xcite . since their discovery in 1844 - 1845 by graves and cayley",
    "there have been various attempts to find appropriate uses for octonions in physics ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "one can point to the possible impact of octonions on : color symmetry @xcite ; guts @xcite ; representation of clifford algebras @xcite ; quantum mechanics @xcite ; space - time symmetries @xcite ; field theory @xcite ; formulations of wave equations @xcite ; quantum hall effect @xcite ; kaluza - klein program without extra dimensions @xcite ; strings and @xmath3-theory @xcite ; _ etc_.    in this paper we would like to study rotations in the model where geometry is described by the split octonions @xcite .",
    "let us review the main ideas behind the geometrical application of split octonions presented in our previous papers @xcite . in this model some characteristics of physical world ( such as dimension , causality , maximal velocities , quantum behavior , etc .",
    ") can be naturally described by the properties of split octonions .",
    "interesting feature of the geometrical interpretation of the split octonions is that , in addition to some other terms , their norms already contain the ordinary minkowski metric .",
    "this property is equivalent to the existence of local lorentz invariance in classical physics .    to any real physical signal",
    "we correspond 8-dimensional number , the element of split octonions , @xmath4 where we have one scalar basis unit ( which we denote as @xmath5 ) , the three vector - like objects @xmath6 , the three pseudovector - like elements @xmath7 and one pseudoscalar - like unit @xmath8 .",
    "the eight real parameters that multiply basis elements in ( [ s ] ) we treat as the time @xmath9 , the special coordinates @xmath10 , some quantities @xmath11 with the dimensions momentum@xmath12 and the quantity @xmath13 having the dimension energy@xmath12 . we suppose also that ( [ s ] ) contains two fundamental constants of physics - the velocity of light @xmath14 and the planck constant @xmath15 .",
    "the squares of basis units of split octonions are inner product resulting unit element , but with the opposite signs , @xmath16 multiplications of different hyper - complex basis units are defined as skew products and the algebra of basis elements of split octonions can be written in the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fully antisymmetric tensor @xmath19 .    from ( [ algebra ] )",
    "we notice that to generate complete basis of split octonions the multiplication and distribution laws of only three vector - like elements @xmath6 , which describe special directions , are needed . in geometrical application",
    "this can explain why classical space has three dimensions .",
    "the three pseudovector - like basis units @xmath7 can be defined as the binary products @xmath20 and thus can describe oriented orthogonal planes spanned by two vector - like elements @xmath6 .",
    "the seventh basic unit @xmath8 ( oriented volume ) is formed by the products of all three fundamental basis elements @xmath6 and has three equivalent representation , @xmath21    multiplication table of octonionic units is most transparent in graphical form . to visualize the products of ordinary octonions",
    "usually the fano triangle is used , where the seventh basic unit @xmath8 is place at the center of the graphic . in the algebra of split octonions",
    "we have less symmetry and for proper description of the products ( [ algebra ] ) the fano graphic should be modified by shifting @xmath8 from the center of the fano triangle .",
    "also we shall use three equivalent representations of @xmath8 , ( [ i ] ) , and , instead of fano triangle , we arrive to king david s shape duality plane for products of split octonionic basis elements :        on this graphic the product of two basis units is determined by following the oriented solid line connecting the corresponding nodes . moving opposite to the orientation of the line",
    "contribute a minus sign in the result .",
    "dash lines on this picture just show that the corners of the triangle with @xmath8 nodes are identified .",
    "note that products of triple of basis units lying on a single line is associative and not lying on a single line are precisely anti - associative .",
    "conjugation , what can be understand as a reflections of the vector - like basis units @xmath6 , reverses the order of octonionic basis elements in any given expression and thus @xmath22 there is no summing in the last formula .",
    "so the conjugation of ( [ s ] ) gives @xmath23 using the expressions ( [ jji ] ) one can find that the norm of ( [ s ] ) , @xmath24 has @xmath25 signature .",
    "if we consider @xmath26 as the interval between two octonionic signals we see that ( [ sn ] ) reduce to the classical formula of minkowski space - time in the limit @xmath27 .    using the algebra of basis elements ( [ algebra ] ) the octonion ( [ s ] )",
    "can be written in the equivalent form : @xmath28 we notice that the pseudoscalar - like element @xmath8 introduces the quantum term corresponding to some kind of uncertainty of space - time coordinates . for the differential form of ( [ s ] )",
    "the invariance of the norm gives the relation : @xmath29 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2 } \\left [ 1 - \\hbar^2 \\frac{d\\lambda^n}{dx^m}\\frac{d\\lambda_n}{dx_m}\\right ] } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes 3-dimensional velocity measured in the frame ( [ s ] ) .",
    "so the generalized lorentz factor ( [ ds / dt ] ) contains an extra terms and the dispersion relation in our model has a form similar to that of double - special relativity models @xcite .",
    "extra terms in ( [ ds / dt ] ) go to zero in the limit @xmath31 and ordinary lorentz symmetry is restored .    from the requirement to have the positive norm ( [ sn ] ) from ( [ ds / dt ] ) we obtain several relations @xmath32 recalling that @xmath33 and @xmath13 have dimensions of momentum@xmath12 and energy@xmath12 respectively ,",
    "we conclude that heisenberg uncertainty principle in our model has the same geometrical meaning as the existence of the maximal velocity in minkowski space - time .",
    "to describe rotations in 8-dimensional octonionic space ( [ s ] ) with the interval ( [ sn ] ) we need to define exponential maps for the basis units of split octonions .",
    "since the squares of the pseudovector - like elements @xmath7 , as it is for ordinary complex unit , is negative , @xmath34 , we can define @xmath35 where @xmath36 are some real angles .    at the same time for the other four basis elements @xmath37 , which have the positive squares @xmath38",
    ", we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are real numbers .    in 8-dimensional octonionic space - time ( [ s ] )",
    "there is no unique plane orthogonal to a given axis .",
    "therefore for the operators ( [ r(j ) ] ) and ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) it is not sufficient to specify a single rotation axis and an angle of rotation .",
    "it can be shown that the left multiplication of the octonion @xmath26 by one of the operators ( [ r(j ) ] ) , ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) ( e.g. @xmath42 ) yields four simultaneous rotations in four mutually orthogonal planes . for the simplicity",
    "we consider only the left products since it is known that for octonions one side multiplications generate all the symmetry group that leave octonionic norms invariant @xcite .",
    "so rotations naturally provide splitting of a octonion in four orthogonal planes . to define these planes note that one of them is formed just by the hyper - complex element that we choice to define the rotation ( @xmath43 in our example ) , together with the scalar unit element of the octonion .",
    "other three orthogonal planes are given by the three pairs of other basis elements that lay with the considered basis unit ( @xmath43 in the example ) on the lines emerged it in the david s star ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "thus the pairs of basis units that are rotate into each other are just the pairs products of which give considered basis unit and thus form an associative triplets with it .",
    "for example , the basis unit @xmath43 , according to figure 1 , have three different representations in the octonionic algebra , @xmath44 than orthogonal to @xmath45 planes are @xmath46 and @xmath47 . using ( [ j1 ] ) and the representation ( [ r(j ) ] ) its possible to rotated out four octonionic axis and ( [ s ] ) can be written in the equivalent form @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the norms in four orthogonal octonionic planes and the angles are done by : @xmath50 this decomposition of split octonion is valid only if the full norm of the octonion ( [ sn ] ) is positive , i.e. @xmath51 similar to ( [ s - j1 ] ) decomposition exists for the other two pseudovector - like basis units @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast with uniform rotations giving by the operators @xmath7 we have limited rotations in the planes orthogonal to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "however , we can still perform similar to ( [ s - j1 ] ) decomposition of @xmath26 using expressions of the exponential maps ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) .",
    "but now , unlike to ( [ n - j1 ] ) , the norms of corresponding planes are not positively defined and , instead of the condition ( [ s>0 ] ) , we should require positiveness of the norms of each four planes .",
    "for example , the pseudoscalar - like basis unit @xmath8 have three different representations ( [ i ] ) and it can provide the hyperbolic rotations ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) in the orthogonal planes @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the expressions for the 2-norms ( [ n - j1 ] ) in this case are : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    now let us consider active and passive transformations of coordinates in 8-dimensional space of signals ( [ s ] ) . with a passive transformation we mean a change of the coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath13 , as opposed to an active transformation which changes the basis @xmath61 and @xmath8 .",
    "the passive transformations of the octonionic coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath13 , which leave invariant the norm ( [ sn ] ) form just @xmath0 , obviously .",
    "we can represent these transformations of ( [ s ] ) by the left products @xmath63 where @xmath64 is one of ( [ r(j ) ] ) , ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath64 simultaneously transform four planes of @xmath26 .",
    "however , in three planes @xmath64 can be rotate out by the proper choice of octonionic basis .",
    "thus @xmath64 can represent passive independent rotations in four orthogonal planes of @xmath26 separately .",
    "similarly we have some four angles for other six operators ( [ r(j ) ] ) , ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) and thus totally @xmath65 parameters corresponding to @xmath0 group of passive coordinate transformations .",
    "for example , in the case of the decomposition ( [ s - j1 ] ) we can introduce four arbitrary angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 obviously under this transformations the norm ( [ sn ] ) is invariant . by the fine tuning of the angles in ( [ s - j1-r ] ) we can define rotations in any single plane from four .",
    "now let us consider active coordinate transformations , or transformations of eight octonionic basis units @xmath69 and @xmath8 . for them ,",
    "because of non - associativity , result of two different rotations ( [ r(j ) ] ) and ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) are not unique .",
    "this means that not all active octonionic transformation generated by ( [ r(j ) ] ) and ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) form a group and can be considered as a real rotation .",
    "thus in the octonionic space ( [ s ] ) not to the all passive @xmath0-transformations we can correspond active ones , only the transformations that have realization with associative multiplications should be considered .",
    "it was found that these associative transformations can be done by the combine rotations of special form in at least two octonionic planes .",
    "this kind of rotations also form a group ( subgroup of @xmath0 ) , known as the automorphism group of split octonions @xmath70 ( the real non - compact form of cartan s exceptional lee group @xmath2 ) . some general results on @xmath70 and its subgroup structure one can find in @xcite .",
    "let us remind that the automorphism @xmath71 of a algebra is defined as the transformations of the hyper - complex basis units @xmath72 and @xmath73 under which multiplication table of the algebra is invariant , i.e. @xmath74 associativity of this transformations is obvious from the second relation and the set of all automorphisms of composition algebras form a group . in the case of quaternions ,",
    "because of associativity , active and passive transformations , @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , are isomorphic and quaternions are useful to describe rotations in 3-dimensional space .",
    "there is different situation for octonions .",
    "each automorphism in the octonionic algebra is completely defined by the images of three elements that are not form quaternionic subalgebra , or all are not lay on the same david s lime @xcite .",
    "consider one such set , say @xmath77 .",
    "then there exists an automorphism such that @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are some independent real angles . by definition (",
    "[ a ] ) automorphism does not affect unit scalar @xmath5 .",
    "the images of the other basis elements under automorphism ( [ auto ] ) are determined by the conditions : @xmath81 it can easily be checked that transformed basis @xmath82 satisfy the same multiplication rules as @xmath83 .",
    "there exists similar automorphisms with fixed @xmath52 and @xmath53 axis , which are generated by the angles @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "one can define also hyperbolic automorphisms for the vector - like units @xmath6 by the angles @xmath86 .",
    "for example , if we fix the axis @xmath87 then corresponding to ( [ auto ] ) and ( [ induced ] ) transformations are @xmath88    similarly automorphism with the fixed seventh axis @xmath8 has the form : @xmath89    so for each octonionic basis there are seven independent automorphism each introducing two angles that correspond to @xmath90 generators of the algebra @xmath70 . for our choice of octonionic basis infinitesimal passive transformation of the coordinates , corresponding to @xmath70",
    ", can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the symmetric matrix @xmath93    in the limit @xmath94 the transformations ( [ x , l , o ] ) reduce to the standard @xmath95 rotations of euclidean 3-space by the euler angles @xmath96 .",
    "however , for some problems in quantum regime extra symmetries can be retrieved .",
    "the formulas ( [ x , l , o ] ) represent rotations of ( 3,4)-sphere that is orthogonal to the time coordinate @xmath9 . to define the busts note that active and passive form of mutual transformations of @xmath9 with @xmath97 and @xmath13 are isomorphic and can be described by the seven operators ( [ r(j ) ] ) and ( [ r(j , i ) ] ) ( e.g. first term in ( [ s - j1-r ] ) ) , which form the group @xmath1 . in the case @xmath98 we stay with the standard @xmath95 lorentz boost in the minkowski space - time governing by the operators @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "in this paper the david s star shape duality plane that describe multiplications table of basis units of split octonions ( instead of the fano triangle of ordinary octonions ) was introduced .",
    "different kind of rotations in the split octonionic space were considered .",
    "it was shown that in octonionic space active and passive transformations of coordinates are not equivalent .",
    "the group of passive coordinate transformations , which leave invariant the norms of split octonions , is @xmath0 , while active rotations are done by the direct product of the seven @xmath1-boosts and fourteen @xmath70-rotations . in classical limit",
    "these transformations give the standard 6-parametrical lorentz group .",
