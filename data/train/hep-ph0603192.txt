    "the inclusion the extra dimensions enhance the brs since the particle spectrum extends after the compactification of the extra dimensions .",
    "the extra dimension idea was originated from the study of kaluza - klein @xcite which was related to the unification of electromagnetism and the gravity and the motivation increased with the study on the string theory which was formulated in a space - time of more than four dimensions . since the extra dimensions are hidden to the experiments at present , the most favorable description is the compactification these new dimensions to the surfaces with small radii . in the case of",
    "that the extra dimensions are at the order of submilimeter distance , for two extra dimensions , the hierarchy problem in the fundamental scales could be solved and the true scale of quantum gravity would be no more the planck scale but in the order of electroweak ( ew ) scale @xcite .",
    "the effects of extra dimensions on various physical processes have been studied in the literature extensively @xcite-@xcite . in the extra dimension scenarios ,",

    "if some fields feel the extra dimensions but not all in the theory , those extra dimensions are called non - universal extra dimensions and this is the case where the kk number at vertices is not conserved .",

    "the fermions are assumed at different points in the extra dimension with gaussian profiles and this ensures a possible solution to the hierarchy of fermion masses by considering the overlaps of fermion wave functions in the extra dimensions .",
    "the localization of the higgs doublet in the extra dimension has been considered in @xcite , by introducing an additional localizer field . in @xcite the branching ratios of the radiative lfv decays have been studied in the split fermion scenario , with the assumption that the new higgs doublet is restricted to the 4d brane or to a part of the bulk in one and two extra dimensions , in the framework of the 2hdm .",
    "@xcite is devoted to analysis of the brs of the radiative lfv decays in the case that the new higgs scalars were localized in the extra dimension with the help of the localizer field and the sm higgs was considered to have a constant profile . in the recent work @xcite , the radiative lfv decays were studied with the assumption that the new higgs doublet was localized in the extra dimension with a gaussian profile , by an unknown mechanism , however , the other particle zero modes have uniform profile in the extra dimension .    the present work is devoted to the brs of the lfv z decays in the 2hdm , with the inclusion of one and two extra dimensions by considering that the new higgs doublet is localized in the extra dimension with a gaussian profile , by an unknown mechanism , however , the other particle zero modes have uniform profile in the extra dimension .",
    "first , we assume that the new higgs doublet is localized around origin and , second , we take the localization point as different than the origin but near to that .",

    "<S> we predict the branching ratios of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays in the framework of the 2hdm with the inclusion of one and two extra dimensions , by considering that the new higgs doublet is localized in the extra dimension with a gaussian profile . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that their brs are at the order of the magnitude of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the inclusion of a single extra dimension , in the given range of the free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical values are slightly suppressed in the case that the localization points of new higgs scalars are different than origin . </S>"
