    "note that @xmath317 ( mod 2 ) if @xmath318 and @xmath319 ( mod 2 ) if @xmath320 .",
    "so @xmath321    for the cycle @xmath1 , we contract every edge in @xmath322 and every path in @xmath312 into a vertex assigned the color as the same as the color of their ends , and delete all intermediate vertices of every path in @xmath313 and join its ends by a new edge .",
    "then we get a new cycle @xmath323 with @xmath324 edges .",
