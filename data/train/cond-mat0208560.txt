    "recent advances in nanotechnology have allowed the fabrication of structures containing quantum dots coupled to the external environment .",
    "the quantum dot consists of finite number of electrons confined to the small region of space .",
    "it behaves like an impurity in a metal @xcite and allows the study of the many body correlations between electrons .",
    "however , unlike an impurity which parameters are fixed , the coupling of the quantum dot to the external leads and its other parameters can be changed in a highly controlled way .",
    "most importantly the non - equilibrium transport @xcite can also be studied .",
    "the discovery @xcite of the kondo effect @xcite in the quantum dots connected to external leads by tunnel junctions has resulted in an increased experimental @xcite-@xcite and theoretical @xcite-@xcite interest in this many body phenomenon .",
    "the kondo effect in the quantum dot manifests itself at temperatures @xmath2 lower than the kondo temperature @xmath3 as an increased conductance @xmath4 through the system .",
    "it is due to the formation of the so called abrikosov - suhl or kondo resonance at the fermi energy .",
    "this is a many body singlet state involving spin on the the quantum dot and the electrons in external leads .    the experiments @xcite have confirmed the validity of the theoretical picture .",
    "they also discovered phenomena the explanation of which requires new theoretical ideas .",
    "in particular they have shown the non - orthodox and unexpected behavior of the systems in the kondo regime .",
    "these are _ inter alia _ the observation of the kondo peak at nonzero source - drain voltage @xcite , absence of the odd - even parity effects expected for these systems @xcite and observation of the singlet - triplet transition in a magnetic field .",
    "besides the non - linear current - voltage characteristics it has been possible to measure charge distribution which led to the conclusion of spin - charge separation in a kondo regime , observe the evolution of the transmission phase @xcite and the detection of two different energy scales @xcite related to two stages of the spin screening process in systems with spin @xmath5 , with one of the kondo temperatures as high as @xmath6 .",
    "the great progress in theoretical understanding of the kondo physics in real quantum dots has been made during last decade .",
    "the theory has concentrated on such important aspects as the kondo - driven transport in multilevel quantum dots @xcite , the coupled quantum dots @xcite , double - dot structures in which existence of the kondo effect without spin - degree of freedom and new singlet - triplet effects have been predicted @xcite , the nature ( weak _ vs _ strong coupling ) of the kondo effect at high voltage @xcite , the spin - charge separation in the strongly correlated quantum dot @xcite , the systems driven out of equilibrium by different means @xcite _",
    "etc._.    here we shall focus our attention on the experimental observation @xcite of the kondo effect at nonzero source drain voltages . to state the problem in the right perspective",
    "let us remind that in systems containing quantum dot , the kondo effect manifests itself at low temperatures as an enhanced conductance observed at zero source - drain voltage , @xmath7 @xcite . occasionally , the kondo peak in conductance appearing at nonzero voltages @xmath8 @xcite has been observed and this unusual behavior , called anomalous kondo effect remains unexplained .",
    "recently this phenomenon has been studied systematically @xcite .",
    "the authors have fabricated the dot coupled weakly to one and strongly to another lead and observed the evolution of the peak at @xmath9 .",
    "the source - drain voltage @xmath10 , at which the peak appears , scales roughly linearly with a gate voltage , @xmath11 . in the experimental setup @xcite",
    "the additional electrode determines the asymmetry in the coupling of the dot to left and right leads .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the anomalous kondo peak observed at non zero voltage .",
    "we shall present the results of the model calculations based on the non - equilibrium transport theory @xcite applied to the quantum dot described by the anderson model @xcite with asymmetric coupling to the leads . as we shall see the asymmetry in the couplings is the main factor which leads to this anomalous kondo effect .",
    "the experimentally observed shifts of the kondo peak to higher values of @xmath12 with increasing gate voltage can be satisfactorily explained by assuming that the values of the left and right barriers change together with the gate voltage , while the asymmetry in the couplings remains constant .",
    "this scenario is realized in experiment @xcite .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the model , give the formula for the current through the quantum dot and discuss briefly the methods ( equation of motion ( @xmath0 ) with slave boson representation of electron operators and non - crossing approximation ( @xmath1 ) ) used to calculate on - dot green s function relegating some technical details to the appendix . in section [ sec3 ] we present the results of our numerical calculations of the tunneling conductance across the asymmetrically coupled single level quantum dot in @xmath13 limit .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we discuss here the dot with single energy level .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the transport through quantum dot usually starts with the following , landauer type , formula @xcite for the current @xmath14   \\nonumber \\\\ \\times { \\frac{\\gamma^l_\\sigma(\\omega)\\gamma^r_\\sigma(\\omega ) } { \\gamma^l_\\sigma(\\omega ) + \\gamma^r_\\sigma(\\omega ) } }   { \\left(\\frac{- 1}{\\pi}\\right ) } { \\rm i m } g_{\\sigma}^r(\\omega+ i0^+ ) \\label{curr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 denotes the fermi distribution function for lead @xmath16 with chemical potential @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the ( retarded ) impurity green s function and @xmath19 is the effective coupling of localized electron to conduction band .",
    "the current @xmath20 flowing across the system depends on the source - drain voltage @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electron charge .",
    "the differential conductance of the system defined as @xmath23 is directly measured experimentally @xcite .    to calculate the on - dot green s function @xmath24 we shall describe the dot coupled to the external leads by the single impurity anderson hamiltonian @xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 denote the right ( @xmath27 ) or the left ( @xmath28 ) lead in the system .",
    "other symbols have the following meaning : @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) denotes creation ( annihilation ) operator for a conduction electron with wave vector @xmath31 , spin @xmath32 in the lead @xmath16 , @xmath33 is the hybridization matrix element between conduction electron of energy @xmath34 in the lead @xmath35 and localized electron on the dot .",
    "@xmath36 is the single particle energy at the dot .",
    "@xmath37 is the number operator for electrons with spin up localized on the dot and @xmath38 is the ( repulsive ) interaction energy between two electrons .",
    "our calculations are restricted to very low temperatures , much smaller than the orbital level spacing in quantum dot so it is legitimate to consider single energy level @xmath39 .",
    "there are various methods @xcite of calculating the on - dot green s function entering the current ( [ curr ] ) . here",
    "we shall apply two of them : equation of motion method ( @xmath0 ) and non - crossing approximation ( @xmath1 ) . in both cases",
    "we assume that the coulomb repulsion @xmath38 between electrons on the dot is the largest energy scale .",
    "therefore we take the limit @xmath40 .",
    "the original correlated electron operators are expressed as products of auxiliary fermion and boson ones @xcite .    when using equation of motion method ( @xmath0 ) we apply a mean field like approximation for the slave bosons and calculate all matrix elements of the keldysh green s functions , including the distribution one @xcite . in the process",
    "we consistently decouple all elements of the higher order keldysh green functions @xcite .",
    "the relevant formulae and some technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "as we shall see the method gives correct position of the kondo peak .",
    "however , like the standard @xmath0 it leads to incorrect width of the peak and the occupations .",
    "therefore we have used the non - crossing approximation ( @xmath1 ) , which is generally accepted technique of solving the problem at hand @xcite . in the @xmath1 one maps the infinite @xmath38 anderson model onto the slave boson one and calculates both boson and fermion propagators .",
    "they are expressed by the coupled integral equations @xcite .    where appropriate we shall present the results obtained by both techniques .",
    "let us first discuss the relation between the experimental parameters and those entering the model and the theory .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath41 and @xmath42 have been estimated in ref.@xcite to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "their values and the ratio @xmath45 have been argued to remain constant during the measurements .",
    "the source - drain voltage @xmath46 is the difference of the chemical potentials of the external leads .",
    "the ( back)gate voltage @xmath47 controls the position of the on - dot energy level @xmath39 .",
    "as already mentioned we stick here to the @xmath40 limit . in this limit",
    "there can be at most a single electron with energy @xmath39 on the dot at a time .",
    "we start the presentation of the results with the comparison of the ( equilibrium ) density of states of a quantum dot coupled to two leads obtained by means of @xmath1 and @xmath0 approaches .",
    "it is shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the main features of the @xmath48 remain the same in both approaches .",
    "however the height and the width of the kondo peak is much larger in the @xmath1 .",
    "moreover the spectral weight is shifted towards higher energies . in turn",
    "this leads to different occupations shown in the inset of the fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "now let s turn to the nonequilibrium ( @xmath49 ) density of states . in this case",
    "the high energy features to large extend remain the same as in equilibrium ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) , so the only low energy @xmath48 is shown in the fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "the upper panel presents results obtained _ via _ equation of motion technique for keldysh ( matrix ) green s function.in the lower panel the results obtained with the non - crossing approximation are shown .",
    "the coupling is asymmetric with @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath51 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the case of the symmetric coupling @xmath52 is also shown ( solid lines ) for comparison .",
    "few features have to be noted .",
    "first we see that the kondo peak is always located at energies coinciding with those of the fermi levels of the leads .",
    "thus in non - equilibrium we get ( in the density of states ) two kondo resonances pinned to fermi energies of the left and right electrodes .",
    "note also that the heights of the respective kondo resonances strongly depend on the value of the hybridization .",
    "the overall shape of the density of states is similar .",
    "the positions of the kondo peaks are roughly the same but they differ in width and heigths",
    ". the peaks obtained in @xmath0 , are much narrower and smaller . as a result",
    "the curves in figure ( [ fig2]a ) differ from that in figure ( [ fig2]b ) .",
    "these details in the energy dependence of the density of states may shortly be a matter of direct measurements .",
    "in fact it has been recently predicted theoretically @xcite that the on - dot density of states can be measured in a device containing quantum dot coupled to three leads .",
    "the very weakly coupled third lead will act as a tunneling tip in conventional tunneling microscope and will probe the non - equilibrium density of states . the conductance spectrum measured by this additional electrode has been shown @xcite to follow the non equilibrium density of states , like one shown in fig.(2 ) .",
    "returning to our main subject we show in fig.([fig3 ] ) the differential conductance spectrum corresponding to the same experimental setup as discussed previously in connection with figure ( [ fig2 ] ) .    for comparison",
    "we have also plotted in this figure the conductance through the symmetrically coupled quantum dot . in the symmetric situation ( @xmath52 )",
    "the kondo resonance is located exactly at zero bias ( @xmath53 ) , but for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) it is shifted to the negative ( positive ) voltages @xmath56 .",
    "this finding is in nice qualitative agreement with the experimental studies on the transport through the quantum dot in the presence of the asymmetric barriers @xcite .",
    "while the observed shifts calculated within @xmath0 and @xmath1 are of comparable magnitude the clear differences in their shape are visible .",
    "the @xmath1 peaks are much higher and more symmetric in vicinity of their maxima . for asymmetric coupling the kondo resonance in the conductance",
    "is pinned to the position of the fermi level of that lead which is more strongly coupled ( larger @xmath57 ) to the dot .",
    "it is thus mainly the relative coupling which rules the value of the shift .    in fig.([fig4 ] ) we show the systematic change of the @xmath58 with increasing asymmetry @xmath59 of the coupling .",
    "the upper curves in both panels corresponds to @xmath60 while lower one is for symmetric coupling @xmath61 in steps of 0.5 .",
    "the increase of the asymmetry @xmath62 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 continuously moves the kondo peak away from @xmath65 position .",
    "we have checked that increasing asymmetry to still higher values does not lead to bigger shifts .",
    "this is easy to understand as for large asymmetry one of barriers is not transparent enough to produce the clear kondo resonance in the density of states .",
    "the position of the on - dot electron energy level @xmath39 influences anomalous kondo peak for the asymmetric dot with @xmath66 to lesser extend .",
    "it is only important that it takes a value appropriate for observing a kondo resonance . for all appropriate @xmath39",
    "the shifts are of comparable magnitudes .",
    "the data displayed in the figure ( [ fig4 ] ) qualitatively agree with those plotted in figure ( 5 ) of @xcite and figure ( 3 ) of @xcite . however , theoretical shifts of the kondo peak position are smaller than the experimental",
    ".    there may be additional factors which affect the position of the peaks .",
    "we have checked that the energy dependence of @xmath67 introduces only small quantitative differences in the density of states and differential conductance , and does not lead to better agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "similarly the calculations within @xmath0 approach for finite values of @xmath38 show that finite @xmath38 leads to minor corrections as also does the presence of the additional energy levels in the vicinity of fermi energy .",
    "in all the cases studied one gets usual behavior with kondo peak located at @xmath68 for symmetric coupling to both leads and the anomalous kondo effect for asymmetric coupling .",
    "this proves the importance of the asymmetry in the observattion of it .    in experimental setup",
    "@xcite the changes of the gate voltage @xmath47 , which in first place affect the position of the electron energy level also modify the height of the barriers and their transparency @xmath69 .",
    "this effect is of special importance in the quantum dots defined in the two dimensional electron gas where the voltage at a single electrode couples capacitively to other electrodes @xcite .",
    "if we assume that ( as in experiments ) @xmath62 remains constant ( @xmath70 ) and that the decrease of the energy @xmath39 is accompanied by the simultaneous increase of the couplings @xmath42 and @xmath41 then the calculated shifts get larger .",
    "the occurence of the kondo resonace is possible at low enough temperature .",
    "it is also well known @xcite that changes of temperature move slightly the kondo peak .",
    "we have checked this and found that if temperature is raised the position of the peak moves slightly away from the @xmath68 . at finite temperature the occupation of the dot changes and the abrikosov - suhl resonances smear out and this leads to small changes in the position of the kondo peak .",
    "we thus have combined all above contributions , i.e. assymetry in the couplings @xmath71 , their @xmath39-dependence , and assumed high enough , but still below @xmath3 , temperature to get larger shifts of the kondo peak .",
    "we have shown the results in fig.([fig5 ] ) .",
    "the various curves have been calculated for @xmath72 which is below kondo temperature . in the figure",
    "the change of the position of the on dot energy level is accompanied by the simultaneous change of the barrier transparency . the bottom curve in figure ( [ fig5])corresponds to @xmath73 , @xmath74 , while the upper one corresponds to @xmath75 , @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 is equal to experimentally estimated value of of the smaller of couplings @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath78 is kept constant and equal @xmath79 as estimated in @xcite .",
    "the data are in nice qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "the theoretical shifts , however , are smaller than experimental by a factor of @xmath80-@xmath81 .",
    "to check whether this is due to different asymmetry ratio we plot in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) the results obtained for @xmath82 .",
    "the shifts have increased .",
    "we have found that the emergence of the kondo peak at non zero voltages @xmath83 is caused by asymmetric coupling of the dot to the external electrodes .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with experimental data on the transport through the quantum dot asymmetrically coupled to the leads @xcite .",
    "the theoretical kondo peaks in differential conductance , however , are narrower than experimental ones .",
    "their maxima move to nonzero @xmath46 with increasing the asymmetry or the position of the on - dot energy level .",
    "the simultaneous change of @xmath39 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 can semi - quantitatively explain experimental data .",
    "more experimental results are needed to draw firm conclusions such as the applicability of simple anderson model to asymmetrically coupled quantum dots .",
    "it follows from the presented studies that the asymmetry of the couplings is a necessary ingredient for the explanation of the anomalous kondo effect . within the anderson model one",
    "always gets normal kondo effect for symmetric couplings and small shifts of the kondo peak to non - zero voltages for asymmetric couplings . our inability to explain quantitatively the experimental data may indicate the necessity of much better theoretical treatment of the model or even better model for the description of these complicated systems .",
    "there is a possibility that the experimentally observed features , even though similar to , do not represent genuine kondo effect .",
    "in fact some researches @xcite have seen very small shifts , consistent with present calculations , even for quite asymmetrically coupled quantum dots .          the @xmath1 method to get @xmath84 has been extensively discussed previously @xcite and",
    "there is no need to repeat its derivation again . for the sake of completeness",
    "let us only note that we have adapted the formulae derived in the second paper of the reference @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 method to calculate the @xmath85 is straightforward and in @xmath86 limit leads to @xmath87 with the self - energy @xmath88 in the equation ( [ gfinfty ] ) , @xmath89 denotes the average on - dot occupation number of the spin @xmath90 electrons . in the equilibrium one calculates @xmath89 self - consistently from the retarded green s function @xmath91 .",
    "here we are dealing with nonequilibrium situation and @xmath89 can not be calculated directly from @xmath91 .",
    "instead the nonequilibrium @xcite green s function technique has to be used .",
    "the occupation of the dot at time @xmath92 is expressed _ via _ keldysh `` lesser '' green s function @xmath93 . in the steady state one",
    "gets @xmath94 this shows that the consistent calculations of the retarded @xmath85 requires the knowledge of `` lesser '' one .",
    "the equation of motion for the `` lesser '' @xmath85 has been formulated by niu _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "for the hamiltonian of the form @xmath95 they derived the following general equation for the `` lesser '' gf            where new fermionic ( @xmath100 and bosonic ( @xmath101 operators have been introduced . calculating the on - dot green s function @xmath102",
    "we have taken the third term of @xmath103 as an interaction part @xmath104 and the first two terms of it as @xmath98 .",

    "<S> the quantum dot asymmetrically coupled to the external leads has been analysed theoretically by means of the equation of motion ( @xmath0 ) technique and the non - crossing approximation ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system has been described by the single impurity anderson model . to calculate the conductance across the device </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium green s function technique has been used . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results show the importance of the asymmetry of the coupling for the appearance of the kondo peak at nonzero voltages and qualitatively explain recent experiments . </S>"
