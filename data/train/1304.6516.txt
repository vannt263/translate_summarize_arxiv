    "the determination of properties of nuclei along the neutron drip line poses one of the major challenges for modern nuclear experiment and theory .",
    "the associated observables are an important input to studies of stellar evolution and the formation of elements and provide insight into fundamental aspects of nuclear structure . since these systems are weakly - bound , drip - line nuclei display novel phenomena associated with newly emerging degrees of freedom or , phrased differently , strong correlations .",
    "halo nuclei are one example where the transition to new degrees of freedoms becomes especially apparent .",
    "these nuclei have a tightly bound core with weakly - attached valence nucleons  @xcite .",
    "an up to date overview of the experimental and theoretical state of the art in the field of halo nuclei can be found in the proceedings of a recent nobel symposium on physics with radioactive beams @xcite .",
    "usually , halo nuclei are identified by an extremely large matter radius or a sudden decrease in the one- or two - nucleon separation energy along an isotope chain .",
    "thus they display a separation of scales which exhibits itself also in low - energy scattering observables through a scattering length @xmath0 that is large compared to the range of the nucleon - nucleus interaction @xmath1 .",
    "halo nuclei can be studied with an effective field theory ( eft ) that exploits this separation of scales as a small expansion parameter @xmath2 and is formulated in the relevant degrees of freedom @xcite ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . ) in this eft , the core and the spectator particles are treated as the fundamental fields in the problem and the overall computational complexity decreases significantly .",
    "in contrast to ab initio approaches which try to predict nuclear observables from a fundamental nucleon - nucleon interaction , halo eft essentially provides relations between different nuclear low - energy observables . on the one hand",
    ", it thus provides a framework that facilitates a consistent calculation of continuum and bound state properties when information on the nucleon - nucleus interaction is known . on the other hand",
    ", halo eft can be used to determine two - body scattering properties from few - body observables if a sufficient number of them is known .    in a previous work , canham and hammer",
    "@xcite explored the universal properties and structure of @xmath3 halo nuclei to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the expansion in @xmath4 by describing the halo nuclei as an effective three - body system consisting of a core and two loosely bound valence neutrons .",
    "their main focus was the possibility of such three - body systems to display the universal efimov effect @xcite and on the structure of the halo candidates .",
    "in particular , the matter density form factors and mean square radii were calculated . using this framework , acharya et al . recently carried out a detailed analysis of the implications of a matter - radius measurement  @xcite for the binding energy and existence of excited efimov states in @xmath5c @xcite .",

    "we consider the electromagnetic charge form factor and charge radius of two - neutron halo nuclei interacting through resonant s - wave interactions .",
