    "ngc 4472 ( m49 ) is a giant elliptical galaxy located at 4@xmath22 south of the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "ngc 4472 is the brightest member of the virgo cluster , some 0.2 mag brighter than the cd galaxy m87 .",
    "ngc 4472 is an outstanding example of giant elliptical galaxies showing a bimodality in the color distribution of globular clusters ( gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 , kundu 1999 ) .",
    "geisler , lee , & kim ( 1996 ) and lee , kim , & geisler ( 1998 ) have found from the deep wide ( @xmath23 arcmin@xmath24 ) field ccd imaging of ngc 4472 that the color distribution of the globular clusters in ngc 4472 is remarkably bimodal .",
    "the bimodal color distribution of the globular clusters in ngc 4472 has shown that there are two kinds of cluster populations in this galaxy : a metal - poor population with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath25 dex and a metal - rich population with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath26 dex .",
    "interestingly it is found that the metal - rich globular clusters show some properties in common with the galaxy halo stars in their spatial distribution and color profiles , while the metal - poor globular clusters do not show such behavior .",
    "also it is found that the metal - rich globular clusters are more centrally concentrated than the metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "this result indicates that there may exist some connection between the metal - rich globular clusters and halo stars in ngc 4472 in the formation and evolution processes .",
    "however , these studies based on the ground - based observations could not investigate the properties of the globular clusters close to the center of ngc 4472 , because of the severe crowding problem and strong background halo light in ground - based images of the inner region of the galaxy .",
    "hubble space telescope ( @xmath0 ) data are ideal for the study of the globular clusters close to the center of bright galaxies such as ngc 4472 .",
    "they are especially useful for the study of the structure of the globular cluster system in the central region of ngc 4472 for which little is known by now .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the globular clusters in the inner region of ngc 4472 using the @xmath0 archive data . during the preparation of this paper puzia et al .",
    "( 1999 ) published a paper based on the analysis of the data which are the same as three sets among the four sets used in this study .",
    "however , there are several differences between the two studies , details of which will be described later .",
    "here is given a brief summary of the differences between the two studies .",
    "first , we use one more data set in addition to the data set used by puzia et al . , with which the size of the bright globular cluster sample is increased by 29% and the complete areal coverage of the bright globular cluster sample",
    "is increased significantly ( by a factor of three in the range of the galactocentric radius ) .",
    "secondly , we use different methods of data reduction and analysis from the puzia et al.s . as a result",
    ", our photometry goes about 1 mag deeper and is more complete than the puzia et al.s before incompleteness correction .",
    "third , @xmath4 and @xmath27 magnitudes in our photometry are on average about 0.2 mag fainter than the puzia et al.s for the common objects , while the colors are almost the same between the two studies .",
    "fourth , our results for the peak luminosity of the globular cluster luminosity functions are significantly different from the puzia et al.s , leading to an opposite conclusion on the age of the globular clusters .",
    "fifth , we present for the first time a study of the structure of the central region of the globular cluster systems which was not done by puzia et al .",
    "sixth , we use both the @xmath0 data of the inner region of ngc 4472 and the ground - based data of the outer region of ngc 4472 to investigate any systematic variation over a wide range , while puzia et al . worked with only the @xmath0 data of the inner region .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "sections 2 describes the data used in this study , and 3 explains the reduction of the data .",
    "section 4 presents the color - magnitude diagram of the measured objects in the ngc 4472 field .",
    "sections 5 and 6 show , respectively , the luminosity functions and color distribution of globular clusters .",
    "section 7 investigates the spatial structure of the globular cluster system in ngc 4472 .",
    "primary results are discussed in section 8 , and a summary of this study is given in the final section .",
    "we have used four sets of @xmath0 wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) imaging data on ngc 4472 available in the @xmath0 archive for this study : two fields including the center of ngc 4472 , one field 3 arcmin north , and one field 3 arcmin south from the center of ngc 4472 .",
    "we name these @xmath0 fields : c1 field , c2 field , n field and s field .",
    "the images were obtained with the wide - band filters f555w and f814w .",
    "table 1 lists the observation log of these data and fig .",
    "1 displays the positions and orientations of the @xmath0 fields in the digitized palomar sky survey image of ngc 4472 .",
    "areal coverage of the data used in this study extends out to @xmath28 arcmin , and is almost complete inside @xmath29 arcmin .",
    "c1 and c2 fields include the nucleus of ngc 4472 so that the background halo light is much brighter than the globular clusters in the images . therefore we need to subtract the galaxy halo light before doing photometry of the point sources in the images .",
    "we first construct smooth models of halo light using ellipse fitting and median smoothing , then subtract these models from the original images .",
    "the subtraction works very well and the resulting images show clearly the point sources close to the center of ngc 4472 . cosmic rays in the images were removed and individual images of the same filter were combined into a single image using crrej task in iraf / stsdas .      crowding problem of the point sources seen in the @xmath0 images of ngc 4472 is negligible so that simple aperture photometry is good enough to derive reliable photometry of point sources .",
    "we have obtained the photometry of point sources in the images as follows .",
    "first , we find objects with 4 @xmath30 threshold from the images prepared by combining all f555w and f814w images , using find in iraf / daophot .",
    "secondly , we derive aperture magnitudes of these objects from the combined images of each filter . for this",
    "we use ccdcap designed for accurate aperture photometry of point sources in the @xmath0 images ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the aperture radius of 2 pixels , the sky radius of 58 pixels , and the hardness parameter of 0.8 in ccdcap .",
    "thirdly , we derive the aperture corrections for the aperture radius of 0.5 arcsec using the bright point sources ( which are mostly globular clusters ) in each image , the results of which are listed in table 2 .",
    "finally we derive standard magnitudes and colors of these objects following the description given in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) and kundu et al .",
    "we adopt the zero points of the magnitudes given in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a , b )",
    ". we have tried to measure the excess light of bright globular clusters compared with the stellar point spread function over the aperture region larger than the radius of 0.5 arcsec , as puzia et al . did .",
    "however , it is found that it is not possible to measure reliably the amount of the excess light , because of low signal - to - noise ratios for the outer region .",
    "the final photometry reaches @xmath31 mag , and the total number of objects in the photometry list is about 5670 .",
    "it is not easy to secure reliable photometry of the objects in the @xmath0 wfpc2 images as ours , especially due to difficulty in measuring the sky value and deriving the aperture correction .",
    "fortunately we can check the accuracy of the photometry using the objects located in the overlapped region among the @xmath0 fields .",
    "c2 field ( that was not used by puzia et al .",
    "1999 ) is overlapped with c1 field and n field so that it is very useful for checking externally the accuracy of the photometry of c1 and n fields .",
    "table 3 and fig .",
    "2 show the comparison of the photometry for the point sources common among the @xmath0 fields . in general the photometry of the objects",
    "show good agreement among the overlapped fields , and the mean differences of the photometry for the total sample are @xmath32 ( n = 52 ) and @xmath33 ( n = 59 ) .",
    "this result shows that the sky measurement and aperture correction in our photometry are reliable .      there are included both point sources and extended sources in the list of the detected objects , and these are foreground galactic star , globular clusters in ngc 4472 , or background galaxies . here",
    "we mean galaxies by extended sources , and mean stars and globular clusters ( even though they are somewhat resolved ) by point sources .",
    "point sources are indeed mostly globular clusters rather than stars , as will be shown later .",
    "we have selected point sources from the list of the detected objects using the morphological classifier @xmath34 moment , an indicator for the degree of central concentration of light of an object ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath34 moment is defined as @xmath35^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we have calculated the values of @xmath34 for @xmath36 pixels for the detected objects .",
    "the range of @xmath34 defined by the obvious bright point sources are derived to be @xmath37 , @xmath38 for the pc images , and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for the wf images .",
    "the objects with @xmath34 in these range are classified as point sources .",
    "it turns out that most of the objects in the photometry list are extended sources .",
    "about 1560 objects among the 5670 detected objects were classified as point sources , and the rest as extended source .",
    "these point sources are considered as a final sample of the point sources for the following analysis .",
    "photometry of the bright point sources with @xmath41 mag are listed in table 4 .",
    "most of these objects are located at @xmath42 arcmin from the center of ngc 4472 , and some of them are located out to @xmath43 arcmin ( in the n field and s field ) .",
    "we have compared our photometry with the puzia et al.(1999 ) s for the globular clusters common between the two studies , as displayed in fig .",
    "3 shows that our @xmath4 and @xmath27 magnitudes are on average fainter than the puzia et al.s , but that the colors agree very well between the two .",
    "the mean differences between this study and puzia et al .",
    "are @xmath44 mag for 157 objects with @xmath45 mag , @xmath46 mag for 176 objects with @xmath47 mag , and @xmath48 .",
    "it appears that there are two causes for the photometric differences between the two studies which used the same original @xmath0 data .",
    "first , part of the difference ( 0.1 mag ) is due to the fact that puzia et al . made a mistake in standard calibration .",
    "if the holtzman zero points that are given for the 0.5 radius arcsec aperture are used , the additional aperture correction of 0.1 mag is not needed to derive the total magnitudes ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1995a , b ) .",
    "however , puzia et al . applied this correction , making systematically their magnitudes 0.1 mag too bright . secondly",
    ", part of the difference ( 0.040.05 mag ) may be due to different methods used in the two studies .",
    "we used ccdcap for the aperture photometry of the point sources in the images where the galaxy light is subtracted , while puzia et al .",
    "used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) for the original images .",
    "it is not unexpected that 0.040.05 mag difference exists between the different methods of photometry .",
    "it is also noted that the scatter in the difference in fig .",
    "3 is larger than the scatter in the difference among the objects in the overlapped images in our photometry shown in fig .",
    "2 , indicating that the mean errors in our photometry are smaller than the puzia et al.s .",
    "puzia et al . derived also additional aperture corrections for the 0.5 arcsec radius aperture to the infinite radius aperture for the globular clusters , using the modeled light profiles : @xmath49 mag , @xmath50 mag , and @xmath51 .",
    "since the modeled light profiles given by puzia et al . do not match well the bright globular cluster profiles at the outer radius ( as shown in their fig .",
    "1 ) , it is difficult to estimate how reliable the above corrections are .",
    "above comparison of the photometry is based on the puzia et al.s photometry before these corrections are applied .",
    "if these corrections are included , the magnitude differences between the two studies become larger : @xmath52 mag , @xmath53 mag , and @xmath54 .",
    "we have tested completeness of our photometry using artificial cluster experiment .",
    "we have chosen as a test field a field covered by the pc chip for the c1 field .",
    "this pc field includes the nucleus of ngc 4472 in the center of the image so that incompleteness for this field is the most severe among the fields used in this study .",
    "we have derived empirical point spread function of the clusters using several isolated brightest clusters in the images and have created artificial clusters with different magnitudes by scaling down the images of the selected ones .",
    "we have created 1000 artificial clusters in 10 images for each filter .",
    "then we have repeated the same reduction procedure to estimate how many objects are recovered from the artificial images .",
    "the completeness factors and mean photometric errors obtained in this way are displayed in fig .",
    "4 shows that our photometry is complete for @xmath55 mag , 90% complete at @xmath56 mag , and 50% complete at @xmath57 mag ( at @xmath58 mag ) for the region at @xmath59 arcsec . in the innermost region at @xmath60 arcsec ,",
    "completeness of our photometry is much lower than the outer region : the completeness is 100% for @xmath61 mag , and 50% at @xmath62 mag .",
    "the photometry of the other fields must be more complete than this pc field , because the contribution due to varying galaxy light in the other field is much weaker than this pc field .    from this test",
    "it is concluded that our photometry is almost complete ( @xmath63 ) for @xmath64 mag except for the innermost region at @xmath60 arcsec .",
    "we created a final sample of bright globular clusters with @xmath15 mag used for the analysis of the color of globular clusters , and this sample is considered to be complete .",
    "the number of the bright globular clusters with @xmath15 mag in the region at @xmath60 arcsec is only 11 so that it is negligible compared with the total sample of bright globular clusters used in this study .",
    "figs . 5(a ) and 5(b ) display the @xmath4@xmath65 diagrams of the measured point sources ( about 1560 objects ) and extended objects ( about 4110 objects ) , respectively .",
    "in general , basic features seen in fig .",
    "5 are similar to those seen in the color - magnitude diagrams of ngc 4472 obtained from the ground - based observations by geisler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but the @xmath0 data go much deeper than the ground - based data .",
    "5(a ) shows a dominant vertical feature at the color range of @xmath66 , extending up to @xmath67 mag .",
    "the objects seen in this feature are mostly globular clusters in ngc 4472 .",
    "contamination due to foreground stars is considered to be negligible for this feature .",
    "we consider the point sources with @xmath68 as globular cluster candidates from now on .",
    "a small number of point sources bluer or redder than this range are probably not the members of ngc 4472 .",
    "the vertical structure in the color - magnitude diagram appears obviously to consist of two components : one relatively blue component ( @xmath69 ) and the other relatively red component ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we call them , the blue globular clusters ( bgcs ) and red globular clusters ( rgcs ) , respectively .",
    "we create a sample of the bright globular clusters with @xmath15 mag for the detailed analysis of the globular cluster system , considering the photometric errors and the degree of non - member contamination .",
    "the boxes in fig .",
    "5 represent the boundary of these bright globular clusters .",
    "the numbers of the blue and red globular clusters with @xmath15 mag are 263 and 346 , respectively .",
    "the relative abundance of the bgcs and rgcs derived for the inner region of ngc 4472 in this study is opposite to that based on the outer region of ngc 4472 where there are more bgcs than the rgcs ( @xcite ) .",
    "these bright globular clusters are a final sample used for the analysis of the colors of the globular clusters later .",
    "6 displays the positions of the bgcs , rgcs and faint globular cluster candidates with @xmath71 and @xmath72 mag .",
    "the property of these two components will be discussed in detail later .    on the other hand ,",
    "most of the extended objects seen in fig .",
    "5(b ) are fainter than @xmath73 mag .",
    "these are mostly faint background galaxies , as are often seen in the deep @xmath0 images such as the hubble deep field ( @xcite ) . the striking difference between the color - magnitude diagram of the point sources and that of the extended sources shows that the image classification used in this study works very well for the @xmath0 data .",
    "a sharp drop in the number of the extended objects seen at @xmath74 mag in fig .",
    "5(b ) shows that there are few globular clusters candidates among the extended objects , while a large color scatter in the faint magnitudes seen in fig .",
    "5(a ) indicates that there are some contamination due to galaxies in the faint point sources .",
    "we have cross - identified about 190 bright point sources with @xmath75 mag common between this study and geisler et al .",
    "4 displays the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath76 colors of these objects . using the colors and magnitudes of these objects ,",
    "we have derived transformation relations between @xmath77 system and @xmath78 system :    @xmath79 for @xmath80 with @xmath81 ,    @xmath82 for @xmath83 with @xmath84 , and    @xmath85 with @xmath86 .    fig .",
    "7 shows the color transformation relation obtained in this study in comparison with the relation derived from the photometry of the standard stars by geisler ( 1996 ) : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath65 colors derived from the relation obtained in this study is systematically redder than those derived from geisler s relation ( by @xmath89 mag for the color of @xmath90 corresponding to the mean color of the globular clusters ) .",
    "we have used the relations derived here for combining the @xmath0 @xmath77 data in this study with the ground - based @xmath91 data ( @xcite;@xcite ) for further analysis .    in this study",
    "we adopt the foreground reddening @xmath92 given by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) , while we adopted a zero foreground reddening given by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) in our previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the extinction to reddening ratio @xmath93 ,",
    "corresponding values are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath8 .",
    "we have derived the luminosity functions of the globular clusters ( gclf ) , which are listed in table 5 and displayed in fig .",
    "8 . in fig .",
    "8 the luminosity functions of the total sample look almost gaussian , with a peak at @xmath96 mag . we have fit a gaussian function to the data for the range @xmath97 mag , for which our photometry is almost complete .",
    "we derive the peak luminosities : @xmath4(max ) = @xmath98 mag and the width , @xmath99 , and @xmath27(max ) = @xmath100 mag and the width , @xmath101 . assuming the peak luminosity of the galactic globular clusters of @xmath9(max ) @xmath10 mag ( @xcite;@xcite ) and the foreground extinction of @xmath94 mag",
    ", we derive a value for the distance to ngc 4472 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 mpc .",
    "we have also compared the luminosity functions in this study with the puzia et al.s in fig .",
    "9 . for this comparison we used the same fields as used by puzia et al . , c1 , n and s fields and plotted puzia et al.s luminosity functions before incompleteness correction .",
    "also we adjusted the puzia et al.s magnitudes by + 0.14 mag to match our photometry .",
    "9 shows that the luminosity functions in the two studies agree well for @xmath104 mag , but that the luminosity function in this study is somewhat higher than puzia et al.s for @xmath105 mag , especially for the bgcs .",
    "@xmath27-band luminosity functions also show similar results , with some deviations for @xmath106 mag .",
    "this indicates that our photometry is more complete than puzia et al.s before incompleteness correction .",
    "we could not compare the luminosity functions after incompleteness correction , because the information given in puzia et al .",
    "is not enough for comparison .",
    "we have investigated whether there is any systematic difference in the peak value of the luminosity functions of the bgcs and rgcs .",
    "the @xmath4-band luminosity functions of the bgcs and rgcs are also listed in table 5 and displayed in fig .",
    "8 shows that the shapes of the luminosity functions of the two populations are similar and that the peaks are at similar luminosity . from gaussian",
    "fitting to the data , we derive the values for the peak luminosity : @xmath4(max ) @xmath107 mag ( @xmath108 ) for the bgcs , @xmath4(max ) @xmath109 mag ( @xmath110 ) for the rgcs , @xmath27(max ) @xmath111 mag ( @xmath112 ) for the bgcs , and @xmath27(max ) @xmath113 mag ( @xmath114 ) for the rgcs .",
    "therefore the peak luminosities of the bgcs and rgcs are similar within the errors .",
    "this result is consistent with the results based on the data of the globular clusters in the outer region of ngc 4472 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the derived values of the sigma for the two populations are exactly the same for the @xmath4-band , and are slightly different for the @xmath27-band .",
    "if we constrain the sigma as the mean of the two , 1.28 , for the @xmath27-band , we get @xmath27(max ) @xmath115 mag and @xmath116 mag , respectively , for the bgcs and rgcs .",
    "this shows that the difference between the bgcs and rgcs is changed little by constraining the sigma .",
    "the color chosen as the boundary between the bgcs and rgcs , combined with observational errors in color , may affect somewhat the luminosity function that is determined for each group .",
    "however , above results are expected to be changed , if any , little , because there is a clear minimum separating between the bgcs and rgcs in the color distribution , and because the total numbers of the clusters in each population are not much different .",
    "we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov test for the samples derived using the color boundary which is 0.05 mag different from the chosen value .",
    "this value of 0.05 mag is five times larger than the mean error of the chosen value .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the two populations derived using the color boundary which is 0.05 mag different from the chosen value are the same as the original samples with a probability of 80% .",
    "therefore this effect is found to affect little above results .    on the other hand , puzia et al .",
    "suggested that the peak luminosities of the bgcs are 0.40.5 mag brighter than those of the rgcs : @xmath4(max ) @xmath117 mag and @xmath27(max ) @xmath118 for the bgcs , and @xmath4(max ) @xmath119 mag and @xmath27(max ) @xmath120 for the rgcs .",
    "if we adjust puzia et al s magnitudes to match our photometry as shown before , these values will be changed to @xmath4(max ) @xmath121 mag and @xmath27(max ) @xmath122 for the bgcs , and @xmath4(max ) @xmath123 mag and @xmath27(max ) @xmath124 for the rgcs .",
    "therefore the peak luminosities for the bgcs in this study are similar to the puzia et al.s , but the peak luminosities for the rgcs in this study as much as 0.8 mag brighter than the puzia et al.s .",
    "the causes for this large difference for the rgcs between the two studies are not clear . however , there are a few reasons that our results are considered to be more reliable than the puzia et al.s .",
    "first , the peak luminosity differences between the bgcs and rgcs given by puzia et al . are significantly different between the c1 field and ( n+s ) fields : @xmath125 mag and @xmath126 mag for the c1 field , and @xmath127 mag and @xmath128 mag for the ( n+s ) fields .",
    "this indicates that there may be some problems in the data even after the incompleteness correction of their sample .",
    "secondly , our sample of globular clusters is about 30% larger than puzia et al.s ( because we included the c2 field which was not used by puzia et al . ) .",
    "thirdly , our photometry is more complete than puzia et al.s .",
    "puzia et al . used further these differences in magnitudes between the bgcs and rgcs to investigate any age differences between the two components . from the comparison of the peak luminosities of the bgcs and rgcs with the simple stellar population models ( worthey 1994 ; bruzual and charlot 1996 ; maraston 1998 ; kurth et al 1999 ) puzia et al .",
    "concluded that 0.4  0.5 mag differences between the two components indicate that the bgcs and rgcs are coeval within the errors of @xmath129 gyrs .",
    "however , our results indicate that the rgcs are several gyrs younger than the bgc , if we use the same models used by puzia et al .",
    "( their figures 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 ) .",
    "our result on the age difference is similar to the results for the globular clusters in the inner region of m87 ( kundu et al . 1999 ) .",
    "kundu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found from the analysis of the wfpc images of the inner region of m87 that the bgcs are 0.20.3 mag brighter than the rgcs at @xmath4-band , and that the rgcs are 0.06 mag brighter than the bgcs at @xmath27-band , and suggested that the rgcs may be 36 gyrs younger than the bgcs .",
    "globular clusters in the inner region of giant galaxies are ideal targets to study the dynamical effects on the globular cluster system due to external processes .",
    "primary external processes driving dynamical evolution of globular clusters are tidal shocks and dynamical friction . according to the theoretical prediction ,",
    "the most massive clusters will be preferentially depleted by dynamical friction , while less massive clusters with lower density will be more efficiently destroyed by tidal shocks .",
    "these external dynamical effects are expected to be strongly enhanced in the inner region of the galaxies ( @xcite;@xcite;murali & weinberg 1997a , b , c ) . as results of these effects",
    ", it is expected that the globular cluster luminosity function for the inner region of a galaxy will get flatter than that for the outer region , and the peak luminosity for the inner region will get brighter than that for the outer region . however , several observational studies found little evidence supporting these theoretical predictions in the case of the globular clusters of m87 ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "ngc 4472 is another good galaxy to study this aspect .",
    "we have investigated whether the globular cluster luminosity function of ngc 4472 shows any systematic variation on the galactocentric distance , using three methods : a ) the slope of the bright globular cluster luminosity function , b ) the peak luminosity of the globular cluster luminosity function , and c ) the mean luminosity of the bright globular clusters . fig . 10 displays the globular cluster luminosity function for five radial bins .",
    "we have fit the data for the bright part in the range of @xmath130 mag using a logarithmic line to check any systematic variation in the slope , the results of which are shown by the dashed line .",
    "there is seen little systematic variation depending on the galactocentric radius in the logarithmic slope of the bright part of the luminosity function .",
    "next we display the peak luminosity of the @xmath4 and @xmath27 bands globular cluster luminosity function for each radial bin in fig .",
    "11 shows little systematic variation of the peak luminosity depending on the galactocentric radius within @xmath131 arcmin .",
    "the peak luminosity at the outermost position of @xmath132 arcmin seems to be 0.3 mag fainter than the mean value shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    ". this may be either an intrinsic property of the globular clusters or may be caused by the fact that the degree of field contamination due to background galaxies is increasing in the outer region ( see the asymmetric globular cluster luminosity function for @xmath133 in fig . 10 ) .",
    "this point needs to be checked with similar @xmath0 observations for larger areas in ngc 4472 .",
    "however , the following result indicates that the first possibility is low .",
    "we have calculated the mean luminosity of the bright globular clusters with @xmath134 mag .",
    "the magnitude range is chosen that the resulting mean luminosity is not affected at all by incompleteness in our photometry .",

    "12 shows that there is little , if any , change in the mean luminosity of the bright globular clusters for the region at @xmath1 arcmin from the center of ngc 4472 ( the determined values of the slope are smaller than the errors ) .",
    "this result is similar to that of the globular clusters in the inner region of m87 ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",

    "this result of the difference between the bgcs and rgcs is not affected by the errors involved with combining the @xmath0 data and the ground - based data , because it is based on the globular clusters with the same magnitude range .",
    "therefore it is concluded that there is little systematic variation of the globular cluster luminosity function within the range of @xmath137 arcmin , and that the bgcs on average become fainter by 0.2 mag with the increasing galactocentric radius over the range of 9 arcmin , while the rgcs do not .",
    "this result shows that the external dynamical effects are much weaker than the theoretical predictions for the globular cluster systems in ngc 4472 .",
    "the cause for the 0.2 mag variation of the mean luminosity seen only for the bright bgcs is unclear .",

    "the observed properties are consistent with many of the predictions of both the model of episodic in situ formation plus tidal stripping of globular clusters given by forbes , brodie & grillmair ( 1997 ) , and the gaseous merger model given by ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) , but each of the models also has some problems .",

    "ngc 4472 is the brightest member of the virgo cluster , but not a cd galaxy , while m87 is a cd galaxy at the center of the virgo cluster and is only slightly fainter than ngc 4472 .",
    "m87 has been a target of much more studies than ngc 4472 .",
    "recently kundu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented a study of 1057 globular clusters in the inner region ( @xmath176 arcmin ) based on the @xmath0 wfpc2 data of a field centered on the nucleus of m87 .",

    "we have compared the properties of the globular clusters in the inner region of these two galaxies based on the similar data ( this study and @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity function of the m87 globular clusters has a peak at @xmath179(max ) @xmath180 mag with @xmath181 , which are slightly larger than that of ngc 4472 , @xmath179(max ) @xmath182 mag with @xmath6 .",
    "thus ngc 4472 is considered to be slightly closer than m87 .",
    "the luminosity function of the m87 globular clusters does not show any significant spatial variation over the radius of 1.5 arcmin , similarly to the case of ngc 4472 .",
    "the color distribution of the globular clusters in m87 is also bimodal .",
    "the peak colors are @xmath183 and @xmath184 and the mean color of the total sample is @xmath185 .",
    "these values are essentially the same as those of the globular clusters in ngc 4472 , @xmath183 , 1.20 and 1.08 .",
    "thus the characteristic colors of the globular clusters in ngc 4472 and m87 are almost the same",
    ".    the surface number density profiles of the globular clusters are flat in the central regions of both m87 and ngc 4472 .",
    "the core radii of the globular clusters in the inner region of m87 and the stellar halo are , respectively , 56 arcsec and 6.8 arcsec ( kundu et al . 1999 ) .",
    "therefore the core of the globular cluster system in m87 is somewhat smaller than that of ngc 4472 , 78 arcsec , while the core of the stellar halo in m87 is twice larger than that of ngc 4472 , 3.6 arcsec .",
    "the relative number of the bgcs to that of the rgcs in m87 is also increasing with increasing galactocentric radius , as in the case of ngc 4472 .",
    "the absence of the spatial variation of the globular cluster luminosity function and the core radius of the globular cluster systems larger than the stellar core of the galaxies are considered to support the suggestion that the large core of the globular cluster systems is a relic of the cluster formation process rather than a result due to destruction through tidal shocking and dynamical friction ( grillmair , pritchet , & van den bergh 1986 , harris et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "however , the surface central number density of the globular clusters is about six times larger in m87 ( 460 clusters arcmin@xmath156 ) than in ngc 4472 ( 81 clusters arcmin@xmath156 ) .",
    "this indicates that the conditions of formation process of globular clusters might have been different between m87 and ngc 4472 .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the properties of the globular clusters in the inner regions of ngc 4472 and m87 are very similar in general .",
    "the only significant difference is that the surface central number density of the globular clusters ( and the specific frequency of the globular clusters correspondingly ) is much higher in m87 than in ngc 4472 .",

    "this structure consists obviously of two populations : the blue globular clusters and the red globular clusters .",
    "the luminosity function of the globular clusters is well fit by a gaussian function with a peak at @xmath186 mag and @xmath99 . from this the distance to ngc 4472 is derived to be @xmath7 mpc .",
    "the globular cluster luminosity function shows little systematic variation depending on the galactocentric radius .",
    "there is little difference in the peak luminosity between the bgcs and rgcs .",
    "this indicates that the rgcs may be several gyrs younger than the bgcs , contrary to the conclusion given by puzia et al .",
    "the color distribution of the 609 bright globular clusters with @xmath15 mag is distinctively bimodal with peaks at @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the metallicities corresponding to these peaks are [ fe / h ] @xmath13 and @xmath14 dex .",
    "the mean color of the bright globular clusters with @xmath15 mag is derived to be @xmath16(m.e . ) , corresponding to the metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath17 dex .",
    "4 .   the ratio of the number of the bgcs to that of the rgcs is increasing with increasing galactocentric radius from the center out to about 9 arcmin .",
    "thus the rgcs are more centrally concentrated than the bgcs .",
    "the surface number density profile of the globular clusters in the inner region is approximately fit by a king model with core radius @xmath21 arcmin , while that of the globular clusters in the outer region is better fit by de vaucouleurs law .",
    "the core radius of the globular cluster system obtained in this study is much larger than that of the stellar halo .",
    "the mean colors of the bgcs and rgcs change little with increasing radius , and the mean color of the rgcs is very similar to that of the stellar halo of ngc 4472 .",
    "the radial gradient of the metallicity of the entire sample of the globular clusters with @xmath15 mag is approximately fit by [ fe / h ] @xmath189 @xmath190 with @xmath175 , where @xmath169 is given in the unit of arcmin .",
    "8 .   in general the property of the globular clusters in the inner region of ngc 4472 is consistent with that of the globular clusters in the outer region of ngc 4472 , except that there are more rgcs than the bgcs in the inner region .",

    "<S> surface number density profiles of both the bgcs and rgcs get flat in the central region , and the core radii of the globular cluster systems are measured to be @xmath19 arcmin for the bgcs , @xmath20 arcmin for the rgcs , and @xmath21 arcmin for the total sample , which are much larger than the stellar core of the galaxy . in general the properties of the globular clusters in the inner region of ngc 4472 are consistent with those of the globular clusters in the outer region of ngc 4472 . </S>"
