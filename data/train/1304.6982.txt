    "in the last years the study of the early universe has raised the interest of cosmologists due to some new issues on this topic as new inflationary cosmologies , quantum gravity , etc .",
    "currently inflation is a well grounded theory having an experimental status , that has a good interface with high - energy physics and provides various approaches to topical problems of the fundamental physics , specifically to the problem of divergence in a quantum theory or the singularity problem in the general theory of relativity .",
    "furthermore , in some way it leads to the problem of quantum - gravitational effects and their adequate description .",
    "these reasons , among others , make the investigation of the early universe of particular importance .",
    "inflationary cosmology is one of the paradigms that will be confirmed with new observational data coming from the planck satellite .",
    "inflation has become the standard paradigm for explaining the homogeneity and the isotropy of our observed universe @xcite . during this epoch the energy density of the universe was dominated by some scalar field ( the inflaton ) , with negligible kinetic energy density , in such a way that its corresponding vacuum energy density is responsible for the exponential growth of the scale factor of the universe . along this phase",
    "a small and smooth region of the order of size of the hubble radius , grew so large that it easily encompassed the comoving volume of the entire presently observed universe , and consequently the observable universe become so homogeneous and isotropic , spatially .",
    "moreover , it is now clear that the structure in the universe has its origin primarily with an almost scale - invariant super - horizon curvature perturbation",
    ". unfortunately , there are plenty of inflationary models the majority of them in good concordance with observations , but none free of problems , as for example the transplanckian problem , the hierarchy problem , etc @xcite .",
    "this has lead cosmologists to look for some new theoretical alternatives @xcite .",
    "in particular the resort to extra dimensions has been of some success .",

    "the basic extension to 5d describes a spin-2 graviton , a spin-1 photon and a spin-0 scalaron , which can be related , respectively , to the einstein , maxwell and higgs fields @xcite . in the cosmological context",
    "the extra dimension is already known to be of great importance .",
    "there is a class of 5d cosmological models which reduce to the usual four dimensional ones , on hypersurfaces defined by establishing a foliation on the fifth extra coordinate . in these models the matter is explained as a consequence of the geometry in five dimensions .",
    "+ the idea that the equation of state for matter is @xmath1 ( and not @xmath2 ) was previously explored in some works using some ideas of the space - time - matter ( stm ) theory , from the gravitational @xcite and cosmological @xcite points of view . the origin of gravitational waves has been also considered for a large - scale repulsive gravitational field from a 5d vacuum @xcite . in this work",
    "we develop a non - perturbative formalism for scalar metric fluctuations from a 5d extended schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) cosmological metric .",
    "it can be seen that on cosmological scales gravity becomes repulsive and these fluctuations behave as a longitudinal gauge @xcite .",

    "in the section iv we have obtained the weak field limit of the 5d field equations for both fields : the inflaton field @xmath34 and the scale - invariant metric fluctuation field @xmath54 .",
    "a similar mechanism can be applied in the case of the effective 4d field equations of the section v. thus , let us use the semiclassical approximation : @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the background 4d inflaton field and @xmath100 stands for the 4d inflaton field quantum fluctuations . taking this into account , the evaluation of equation ( [ a28 ] ) on @xmath76 yields @xmath101 where we have used the relation : @xmath102|_{\\psi=\\psi_0 } = -m^2\\bar{\\varphi}_b$ ] , such that @xmath103 is a separation constant .",

    "now it can be shown that equation ( [ 36 ] ) , evaluated on @xmath76 , leads to the condition @xmath112 . using this last condition in equation ( [ b18 ] ) , we obtain @xmath113\\omega=0.\\ ] ] if we introduce the auxiliary field @xmath114 , through the formula @xmath115 the equation ( [ b19 ] ) , becomes @xmath116 now , in order to quantize the field @xmath117 , we shall expand it in fourier modes @xmath118,\\ ] ] where the annihilation and creation operators @xmath119 and @xmath120 satisfy the commutation algebra @xmath121=\\delta^{(3)}(\\bar{k}-\\bar{k}^{\\prime}),\\qquad [ a_k , a_{k^{\\prime}}]=[a_{k}^{\\dagger},a_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\dagger}]=0.\\ ] ] inserting ( [ b22 ] ) in ( [ b21 ] ) and using ( [ b23 ] ) , we find @xmath122 where @xmath123 . using ( [ b22 ] ) and ( [ b23 ] ) in the second expression of ( [ b14 ] ) , the modes @xmath124 must satisfy in the uv - sector the normalization condition @xmath125 thus , choosing the bunch - davies vacuum condition , the normalized solution of ( [ b24 ] ) reads @xmath126,\\ ] ] where @xmath127 $ ] is the second kind hankel function , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "notice that @xmath130 , such that the conformal time at the beginning of inflation @xmath131 is defined such that @xmath132 and the conformal time at the end of inflation complies with @xmath133 . using the definition of @xmath134 , it is easy to show that the parameter @xmath135 for @xmath136 , which assures that the spectral index @xmath137@xcite .",
    "using the fact that @xmath138 , we obtain that the range of acceptable values for @xmath139 is @xmath140 figure ( [ f1 ] ) shows the evolution of @xmath141 during inflation for @xmath142 .",
    "it is important to see how the universe becomes scale invariant with the expansion of the universe .",
    "notice that the temporal evolution of @xmath134 , and hence of the spectral index @xmath143 , is due to the existence of @xmath111 , which has a clear origin in the extra space - like coordinate @xmath6 [ see eqs .",

    "the intensity of the fluctuations are weak enough , so we can take a longitudinal gauge , and thus one can implement the approximation @xmath144 .",
    "we have shown that the energy density on the 4d hypersurface is induced geometrically by the foliation @xmath108 , in virtue of the background energy density coming from the inflaton field being null .",

    "finally , our 5d model resolves the problem of some 4d standard inflationary models in which the background values of the inflaton field @xmath145 are transplanckians . in our case @xmath146 , so that all the background energy density is due to the 4d induced cosmological constant , which is induced on the 4d hypersurface by the foliation @xmath108 .",
