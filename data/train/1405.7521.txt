    "a one dimensional position sensitive detector for thermal neutrons is currently under development at psi , in the framework of the upgrade of the engineering diffractometer poldi @xcite installed at the swiss neutron spalation source ( sinq ) at psi . to allow a simultaneous measurement of the axial and transverse strain components during in - situ deformation measurements ,",
    "the actual @xmath3he detector module will be replaced by two oppositely placed scintillation detector modules .",
    "the main requirements for the new detector are : a detection efficiency of 65% at 1.2  @xmath4 , a time resolution below 1  @xmath2s ( standard deviation ) , a channel width of about 2.5  mm , a system background rate below @xmath5  hz / channel , a sustainable count rate of 4  khz / channel and a gamma sensitivity below @xmath6 .    the worldwide supply shortage of @xmath3he which started in 2009 stimulated the development of alternatives to @xmath3he gas detectors for thermal neutron detection @xcite .",
    "one of this alternatives is based on zns/@xmath0lif or zns/@xmath7b@xmath8o@xmath9 scintillators combined with wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers for collecting the scintillation light .",
    "this technology is now widely used and well established .",
    "the two single - crystal time - of - flight diffractometers _ senju _ @xcite and ibix @xcite at j - parc , as well as the engineering diffractometer vulcan @xcite and the powder diffractometer powgen3 @xcite in ornl are examples of instruments currently in operation which are equiped with detectors based on this technology . up to now , all the detectors of this kind use photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) or multi - anode photomultiplier tubes ( mapmts ) to read out the wls fibers .",
    "the feasibility to use silicon photomultipliers ( sipms ) has not been proved yet .",
    "nevertheless , the use of sipms for the new poldi detector is very attractive because of their high packing fraction and their insensitivity to magnetic fields , two important characterisitcs in this project since the space in the poldi experimental area is very limited and tests of samples in high magnetic fields are foreseen .",
    "two variants of a single channel detection unit which can constitute an elementary building block for a one dimensional position sensitive multi - channel detector have been investigated in a neutron beam .",
    "the detection units consist of zns/@xmath0lif scintillating layers with embedded wls fibers read out with a silicon photomultiplier ( sipm ) . in this paper",
    ", we present the design of the detection units , the signal processing system and the measurements of the probability of neutron capture , the light yield distribution for the capture of neutrons , the trigger efficiency , the system background rate , the count rate capability .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic_sandwich ] shows the schematic of the two detection units which were tested in the present work .",
    "they consist of two zns/@xmath0lif scintillating layers ( nd2:1 from applied scintillation technologies @xcite ) sandwiching an array of wls fibers ( y11(200)m from kuraray @xcite ) with a diameter of 250  @xmath2 m .",
    "the fiber pitch is 0.6  mm and 0.8  mm for the 4-fiber and 3-fiber detection units , respectively . in the 450  @xmath2 m thick layer ( bottom layer ) ,",
    "three or four grooves of 300  @xmath2 m width and 300  @xmath2 m depth are machined .",
    "the fibers are glued into the grooves with an optical epoxy ( ej500 from eljen technology @xcite ) and the top scintillating layer 250  @xmath2 m thick is glued with the same optical epoxy .",
    "on one side , the fibers are cut along the edge of the sandwich and polished .",
    "then , an aluminum foil acting as a mirror is glued to improve the light yield on the other side of the fibers where the photodetector is connected . on this side",
    ", the fibers are glued together into the hole of a plexiglas holder and polished .",
    "[ fig : sandwich_before_gluing ] and [ fig : sandwich_after_gluing ] show a picture of the sandwich before and after assembling with a fiber holder .",
    "the effective channel width is defined by the area covered by the fibers .",
    "it is about 2.4  mm .",
    "the aditionnal space to the total width of 7  mm is used for handling purposes only .",
    "the length of the structure is 50  mm .    in a later multi - channel detector ,",
    "this 2.4  mm wide groove / wls fiber pattern without the additional handling space will be repeated to cover the needed sensitive area . in order to obtain the required neutron absorption probability",
    ", several such sandwiches will be stacked together ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multichannel ] ) .",
    "a 4-sandwich detector would have a thickness of 2.8  mm and its intrinsic time resolution would be below 0.4  @xmath2s for all neutron wavelengths between 1  @xmath4 and 6  @xmath4 . by the intrinsic time resolution , we understand the standard deviation of the neutron travel time from the moment it enters the detector to the moment it is absorbed in it .        the @xmath0li concentration in the scintillating layers has been determined with a neutron transmission measurement",
    ". it amounts to @xmath10  atoms / cm@xmath3",
    ". the hydrogen concentration amounts to about @xmath12  atoms / cm@xmath3 and @xmath13  atoms / cm@xmath3 in the scintillating layers and in the wls fibers , respectively .",
    "the sipm used in this test is a @xmath14  mm@xmath15 s12571 - 025c mppc from hamamatsu @xcite .",
    "it is operated at room temperature , at the recommended overvoltage of 3.5  v. in this condition , the sipm has a pde of 35% at 480  nm ( the emission peak of the wls fibers ) , a crosstalk probability of 22% @xcite , a dark count rate of 70  khz and an afterpulse probability below 3% @xcite .",
    "the signal processing system is based on a photon counting approach .",
    "two reasons make this approach feasible .",
    "first , the zns/@xmath16lif scintillator is relatively slow and consequently , the photons to detect are sufficiently spaced out in time to be counted individually . secondly , the sipm have an excellent photon counting capability .    fig .",
    "[ fig : sps_schematic ] shows the block diagram of the signal processing system .",
    "the sipm signal is amplified and shaped by a wide band - width amplifier .",
    "the output of the amplifier is fed into a fast leading edge discriminator with a threshold set at 0.5 photoelectron .",
    "the discriminator is set in burst guard mode so that its output signal stays high as long as the input is over the threshold .",
    "the duration of the output for a single photoelectron is 8  ns .        the trigger logic is composed of two levels l@xmath17 and l@xmath18 . the principle of the level l@xmath17 is the following .",
    "each count from the discriminator opens a time window w@xmath18 of duration t@xmath18 . if the next count arrives during w@xmath18 , a second time window w@xmath8 of duration t@xmath8 is opended .",
    "the level l@xmath17 triggers if the next count arrives during w@xmath8",
    ". then a third time window w@xmath9 of duration t@xmath9 equal to 2@xmath2s is opended .",
    "the level l@xmath18 triggers if the number of counts during w@xmath9 is equal or higher than a threshold value n@xmath9 . table [ trigger_settings ] shows the two trigger settings used in this work . the low threshold trigger used for the measurements of the photoelectron number distribution at low count rates requires in total a minimum of 7 photoelectrons within a time window of 2.8  @xmath2s and the high threshold trigger used for the measurements at high count rates requires in total a minimum of 23 photoelectrons within a time window of 2.3  @xmath2s .    in order to prevent multiple triggers on the same neutron event , the trigger logic needs to be blocked after each trigger during some time .",
    "the minimum blocking time depends on the trigger setting . at low and high threshold , the blocking time",
    "is set at 200  @xmath2s and 30  @xmath2s , respectively .",
    "the capture of a neutron within this blocking time leads to the risk to get a late trigger related to this capture after the trigger logic is released .",
    "for this reason , the measurements with the long blocking time of 200  @xmath2s are performed at a small rate of about 20  hz which makes this process negligible .",
    ".trigger settings used in this work .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : double_triggers ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : npe_spectrum_high_low_rate ] shows the photoelectron number distribution measured with the 3-fiber detection unit , at low ( 21  hz ) and high ( 3576  hz ) count rates of neutrons for the two time windows [ 0@xmath2s;2@xmath2s ] and [ 2@xmath2s;12@xmath2s ] .",
    "the distributions are almost the same at low and high neutron rates .",
    "however , at high count rate , one can notice a little shift to the right of the whole distribution obtained with the [ 2@xmath2s;12@xmath2s ] time window .",
    "this shift corresponds to the integration of the background counts produced by the scintillator afterglow .",
    "s ] ( top ) , [ 2@xmath2s;12@xmath2s ] ( bottom ) . ]    knowing the rate of singles @xmath19 ( 1567  khz ) , the sipm dark count rate @xmath20 ( 70  khz ) and the rate of captured neutrons @xmath21 ( 5007  hz ) obtained after correction of the measured neutron rate for the dead time of the detection unit and for the 80% trigger efficiency , equation [ eq : pe_number_per_neutron ] allows to estimate the average number of photoelectrons @xmath22 produced by a neutron .",
    "the calculation gives a value of about 300  photoelectrons per captured neutron .",
    "@xmath23    the information concerning the decay curve of the scintillator @xcite shows that 23% of the scintillating light is produced after the protection window of 30  @xmath2s .",
    "consequently , in average 70  photoelectrons are produced after the protection window , resulting in a significant photoelectron background rate which increases proportionally with the rate of neutrons .",
    "thus , during a measurement performed at rate of captured neutrons of 5  khz , the photoelectron background rate due to the scintillator afterglow is about 340  khz , which is already 5 times higher than the sipm dark count rate .",
    "two detection units for thermal neutrons combining zns(ag)/@xmath0lif scintillating layers and wls fibers read out with a sipm have been evaluated in a neutron beam .    by repeating lateraly the pattern of this detection units ,",
    "it is possible to build a one dimensional position sensitive multi - channel detector with the needed sensitive area . in order to get the required neutron detection efficiency for the new detector of the poldi diffractometer ( 65% at 1.2  @xmath4 ) , the pattern with 3 fibers as well as the pattern with 4 fibers should be repeated vertically at least 4 times , leading to a number of fibers per channel equal to 12 and 16 , respectively .",
    "while 12 fibers can fit into a 1.00  mm diameter hole which matches almost perfectly the @xmath14  mm@xmath15 sensitive area of the sipm , 16 fibers can only fit into a 1.15  mm diameter hole which goes over the edge of the sensitive surface of the sipm .",
    "the use of a sipm with a larger sensitive surface is not desirable since in that case , the sipm would have a higher initial dark count rate and it would accumulate a higher radiation dose .",
    "consequently , the 3-fiber pattern is prefered , even if it provides a slightly lower light collection efficiency which results in a sligthly lower trigger efficiency in comparison to the 4-fiber pattern .    for sipms with a dark count rate as high as 0.7  mhz ,",
    "the 3-fiber detection unit provides a trigger efficiency of 80% together with a system background rate below @xmath1  hz , a dead time of 30  @xmath2s and a negligible rate of multiple triggers .",
    "no change of performance is observed for neutron count rates of up to 3.6  khz .",
    "apart from the gamma sensitivity which has not been measured yet , the obtained results indicate that a multi - channel detector based on the 3-fiber pattern could satistfy without compromise all the requirements for the new poldi detector .",
    "when the dead time of the 3-fiber detection unit is set to 30  @xmath2s or less , the level of the trigger threshold is conditioned by the maximum acceptable rate of multiple triggers and not by the maximum acceptable system background rate which is related to the sipm dark count rate .",
    "so , in this case the limiting factor for the trigger efficiency is not the sipm but the scintillator itself due to its afterglow .",
    "sipms offer many advantages over pmts and mapmts .",
    "they are significantly less expensive , they have a high packing fraction , they are available with small active areas ( e.g. @xmath14  mm@xmath15 ) and they are insensitive to magnetic fields .",
    "thus , the use of sipms turns out to be a significant technological breakthrough which opens new possibilities in designing zns/@xmath0lif scintillation neutron detectors .",
