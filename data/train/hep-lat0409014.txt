    "the low - lying hadron spectrum shows a few features which are fingerprints of qcd . in the meson sector",
    "the pion occurs as an almost - goldstone boson with its squared mass vanishing proportional to the quark mass in contrast to all other mesons .",
    "the observed ordering of the lowest positive , @xmath2 , and negative parity excitations of the nucleon , @xmath3 is unnatural. a physical picture based on linear confinement , coulomb and color - magnetic terms , always arranges the first radial excitation above the first orbital excitation , i.e.  the excited states have alternating parities .    whereas ground state spectroscopy on the lattice is by now a well understood physical problem with impressive agreement with experiment , the lattice study of excited states is not so far advanced . in a lattice calculation",
    "the masses of excited states show up in the sub - leading exponentials of euclidean two point functions",
    ". a direct fit of a single correlator is cumbersome since the signal is strongly dominated by the ground state .",
    "also with methods such as constrained fits @xcite or the maximum entropy method @xcite one still needs very high statistics for reliable results @xcite .",
    "an alternative method is the variational method @xcite where one diagonalizes a matrix containing all cross correlations of a set of several operators with the correct quantum numbers . for a large enough and",
    "properly chosen set of basis operators each eigenmode is then dominated by a different physical state . after normalization",
    "the largest eigenvalue gives the correlator of the ground state , the second - largest eigenvalue corresponds to the first excited state , and so on .",
    "it is important to optimize the spatial properties of the interpolating operators .",
    "an example for this fact is the roper state where the variational method , based on nucleon operators that differ only in their diquark content but have the same spatial wave function , did not lead to success @xcite .",
    "it can be argued that a node in the radial wave function is necessary to capture reliably the roper state or other radially excited hadrons . recently @xcite we demonstrated that an elegant solution is to combine jacobi smeared quark sources with _",
    "different _ widths to build the hadron operators and compute the cross - correlations in the variational method .",
    "we find good effective mass plateaus for the first and partly the second radially excited states .",
    "the propagators are then fitted using standard techniques .    already in @xcite jacobi",
    "smeared sources were combined with point sources and cross - correlations studied in similar spirit ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the technique of jacobi smearing is well known @xcite . the smeared source lives in the timeslice @xmath4 and",
    "is constructed by iterated multiplication with a smearing operator @xmath5 on a point - like source .",
    "the operator @xmath5 is the spatial hopping part of the wilson term at timeslice 0 ; it is trivial in dirac space and acts only on the color indices .",
    "this construction has two free parameters : the number of smearing steps @xmath6 and the hopping parameter @xmath7 .",
    "these can be used to adjust the profile of the source .",
    "here we work with two different sources , a narrow source @xmath8 and a wide source @xmath9 with parameters given by @xmath10 @xmath6 and @xmath7 were chosen such that the profiles approximate gaussian distributions with the indicated half - widths @xcite .",
    "we remark that the two sources allow the system to build up radial wave functions with and without a node .",
    "the parameters were chosen such that simple linear combinations @xmath11 of the narrow and wide profile approximate the first and second radial wave functions of the spherical harmonic oscillator : the coefficients @xmath12 approximate a gaussian with a half - width of @xmath13 fm , while @xmath14 approximate the corresponding excited wave function with one node .",
    "the final form of the wave function is determined through the variational method @xcite . in this approach one",
    "computes a complete correlation matrix of operators @xmath15 that create from the vacuum the state which one wants to analyze .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath16 of the correlation matrix behave as @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the distance of @xmath19 to nearby energy levels .",
    "the hadron sources we use for the correlation matrix are constructed from the narrow and wide quark sources .",
    "for our quenched calculation we use the chirally improved dirac operator @xcite .",
    "it is an approximation of a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation which governs chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "this operator is well tested in quenched ground state spectroscopy @xcite where pion masses down to 250 mev can be reached at a considerably smaller numerical cost than needed for exact ginsparg - wilson fermions . for ground states",
    "the chirally improved action shows very good scaling behavior .",
    "the gauge configurations were generated on a @xmath20 lattice with the lscher - weisz action @xcite .",
    "the inverse gauge coupling is @xmath21 , giving rise to a lattice spacing of @xmath22 fm as determined from the sommer parameter @xcite .",
    "the statistics of our ensemble is 100 configurations .",
    "we use 10 different quark masses @xmath23 ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "our analysis is based on the interpolator @xmath26 .",
    "each of the three quarks can be smeared either narrow ( @xmath8 ) or wide ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this gives 8 possible combinations ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc . ) . from a subset of 4 of these operators ( after projection to definite parity )",
    "we calculate the correlation matrix @xmath29 which we then use in the variational method . the exponential decay of three eigenvalues is clearly identified .",
    "we identify these signals with the nucleon , the roper state and the next positive parity resonance @xmath30 .",
    "a detailed discussion of further checks on the correct identification of the roper state can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite concerning the problem of nucleon-@xmath31 ghost contributions ) .",
    ", @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 as a function of the quark mass ( the experimental data were converted to lattice units with the sommer parameter scale ) .",

[ fig2],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    as another test of our approach we discuss the @xmath1- and @xmath0-mesons and their radial excitations . for the @xmath0 we use the interpolators @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for the pion @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "again we use wide and narrow quark sources for both interpolating fields , corresponding to 3 operators each ( the combinations @xmath39 and @xmath40 give identical correlators and one of them can be omitted ) .",
    "when diagonalizing the @xmath41 matrix with either interpolator we see a pronounced exponential decay only for the two larger ( in magnitude ) eigenvalues , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue @xmath44 does not show a clear effective mass plateau .",
    "this is an indication that this eigenvalue couples to an unphysical quenched ghost state @xcite .",
    "the final results for the masses as a function of the quark mass are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "we find that the ground state meson masses approach their experimental values reasonably well .",
    "the excited state masses are considerably above their experimental values .",
    "there is , however , a plausible reason for this behavior .",
    "the sizes of hadrons which are not , or only weakly , affected by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking can be estimated from the known string tension , which is approximately 1 gev / fm .",
    "hence the size of the excited mesons should be larger than the ground state , about 1.5 fm .",
    "thus the size of our lattice ( 1.8 fm ) is clearly not enough for a precise measurement of e.g.  the @xmath32 mass .",
    "the finite size effect can not be neglected for the excited state since it apparently shifts the measured mass up as compared to the experimental value .",
    "a crucial test of our method is to check whether indeed the ground state is built from a nodeless combination of our sources and the excited states do show nodes .",
    "this question can be addressed by analyzing the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix .",
    "this has been done in @xcite and indeed confirms the expectation .",
