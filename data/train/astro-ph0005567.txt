    "observations of quasars above 2 kev have in the past been largely devoted to objects selected via x - rays .",
    "their 210 kev spectral indices cluster tightly around a `` canonical '' value of 0.9 ( @xmath8 ; williams et al .",
    "1992 , comastri et al .",
    "1992 , reeves et al .",
    "1997 , lawson & turner 1997 ) .",
    "this uniformity may be the result of a selection effect ( elvis 1992 ) .",
    "seyfert galaxies , in fact , do indeed show a significantly wider range of 210 kev spectral indices ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) and qsos might show the same effect as reported by recent studies of asca observations ( george et al .",
    "we have therefore started a program to observe , with bepposax ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) , a reasonably large , well defined , and representative sample of optically selected quasars .",
    "our goals are to perform a systematic study of their hard ( @xmath9 kev ) emission spectra and , taking advantage of the broad bepposax band , to compare them with the soft 0.12 kev spectra acquired simultaneously .",
    "bepposax has so far observed 10 quasars extracted from the laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample , nine as part of a core program and one as part of the science verification phase ( svp ) .",
    "the laor et al .",
    "sample consists of 23 pg quasars selected to have @xmath10 , galactic @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these quasars all have good rosat pspc x - ray spectra , radio fluxes , ir photometry , high s / n optical spectro photometry , iue and hst spectra ( laor et al . 1997 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "the 0.22 kev pspc spectra of most of these 23 quasars are well fitted by a single power law plus galactic absorption .",
    "the average spectral index is @xmath14 , and the @xmath15 range is 0.92.8 .",
    "the large spread in @xmath15 permitted the discovery of correlations between the soft x - ray spectral shape and optical emission line properties ( laor et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 , boller , brandt & fink 1996 , ulrich - demoulin & molendi 1996 ) : steeper soft x - ray quasars tend to have narrower @xmath16 lines , fainter [ oiii ] emission and stronger feii emission with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpret the @xmath17 fwhm anticorrelation in terms of a dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath18 .",
    "the line width is inversely proportional to @xmath19 if the broad line region is virialized and if its size is determined by the central source luminosity ( see laor et al .",
    "1997 ,  4.7 ) .",
    "so narrow - line , steep ( 0.12 kev ) spectrum agns emit close to the eddington luminosity ( nicastro 2000 ) .    a proposed scenario for these sources , as described by pounds et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , is that the hard x - ray power law is produced by comptonization in a hot corona : as the object becomes more luminous in the optical - uv , compton cooling of the corona increases .",
    "the corona becomes colder , thus producing a steeper x - ray power law .",
    "if this mechanism is operating , then steep @xmath15(pspc ) quasars should also have a steep hard x - ray power law that would have been missed by hard x - ray surveys .",
    "bepposax 0.110 kev observations should help in verifying this picture ; test if the correlations between the soft x - ray spectrum and the optical lines properties hold also at high x - ray energies ; and study the iron k emission lines in high luminosity objects , to test the claim of an x - ray baldwin effect ( iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 , nandra et al .",

    "in this paper we report the analysis of bepposax observations of 10 pg quasars . in ",

    "we presented the spectral analysis of the bepposax observations of 10 pg quasars selected from the laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * together with pg  1226@xmath6023 a positive detection of the continuum in the 15100 kev energy range has been found in two more quasars : pg  0947@xmath6396 and pg  1115@xmath6407 . however , a possible contamination from hard serendipitous sources in the pds field of view can not be ruled out with the present data . *",
    "the distribution of the 210 kev power law energy indices is similar to that observed in other quasars samples .",
    "the dispersion around the average value of @xmath24 reflects the large spread of the best  fit values over the range 0.5 @xmath25 1.5 . *",
    "no intrinsic absorption has been detected in any of the objects since the absorbing columns are always compatible with the galactic values . *",
    "significant spectral curvature is present in the bepposax spectra of most of the quasars and is related to the statistics of the observed spectrum : sources with the same energy index over the 0.110 kev band are fainter .",
    "the average curvature can be parameterized as a spectral flattening by @xmath26 towards high energies requiring two component models .",
    "the exact spectral shape and intensity of these components vary from object to object . in a few cases the curvature is due to a strong  soft excess `` below about 1 kev , while for pg 1626@xmath6554 , independent lecs ",
    "pspc fits suggest the presence of an ' ' ultra soft excess \" ( below  0.3 kev ) .",
    "the curvature in pg  1402@xmath626 is mainly due to a hard tail above @xmath2 5 kev rather than a  soft excess \" ; also pg  1626@xmath6554 shows evidence for a hard tail",
    ". a spectral hardening at even higher energies ( @xmath7 10 kev ) could be present in the two quasars detected in the pds band .",
    "* the origin of the spectral curvature is likely due to the combined effect of thermal emission from an accretion disk peaking in the far uv and the onset of a compton reflection component at high energies .",
    "the addition of these components does provide a better description of the observed spectra .",
    "we also note that quasars with a steeper 0.12 kev spectrum tend to be steeper also in the 210 kev band , although the effect is detected only at the 68 % confidence level . *",
    "iron k@xmath5 lines are detected in 4 quasars .",
    "the rest frame line energy ( 6.7 kev ) and equivalent width ( 580 ev ) of pg  1115@xmath6407 are consistent with those found in a few low redshift narrow  line seyfert 1 galaxies ( comastri et al .",
    "1998 , turner et al .",
    "1998 , vaughan et al .",
    "1999 , leighly 1999 ) .",
    "the contemporaneous presence of a steep 0.110 kev continuum and narrow h@xmath27 line allows us to classify this object as a relatively high redshift nlsy1 .",
    "+ for the optically broad lined quasar pg  0947@xmath6396 , the rest frame line energy of 6.4 kev is similar to that found in many local seyfert 1 galaxies , suggesting fluorescence from cold iron .",
    "the line equivalent width ( 670 ev ) is however higher ( at the @xmath28 level ) than that usually found in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we investigate the possibility that the high ew of the line , as well as an excess of counts detected in the pds , are the result of fitting a complex continuum with a simple power - law model .",
    "we tried several other models ( the inclusion of a compton reflection component or of a thick and partial covering absorber ) but in all cases the line is still required and its ew is never smaller than 400 ev . + a line has also been detected in pg  1352@xmath6183 and pg  1226@xmath6023 . in the first case the line energy and intensity are compatible with the values detected in many seyfert galaxies . in the second case it could be witnessing a seyfert - like spectrum diluted in the jet emission ( grandi et al .",
    "1997 , haardt et al . 1998 ) .",
    "+ the detection of significant fe k  shell emission in 3 radio  quiet quasars with 210 kev luminosities in the range 15 @xmath29 10@xmath30 erg s@xmath21 seems to be inconsistent with the trend seen in other radio  quiet agn ( iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997 , george et al .",
    "2000 ) , where iron lines are more frequently found in lower luminosity objects .",
    "* a detailed comparison with the recent asca observations of a larger sample of radio  quiet quasars ( george et al . 2000 ) is not possible owing to the different responses , sensitivities and energy ranges covered by asca and bepposax .",
    "we note however that there is a good agreement between the two samples especially for what concerns the average 210 kev slope and intrinsic dispersion and the presence of curved convex spectra in most of the objects .",
    "the detection with bepposax of a strong iron line in a few relatively high luminosity objects deserves further investigation .",
    "the foreseen xmm - newton quasar surveys will most likely settle several open issues .",

    "pspc intercalibration and p.ciliegi for the several comments and suggestions to the paper .",

    "the discrepancy between the bepposax soft spectral index and the pspc one can be due to systematic errors in the instrument intercalibration . to investigate this discrepancy we fitted the lecs spectra in the energy range 0.11.5 kev with a power law plus galactic absorption . considering the different response curves of the two instruments around 1 kev ( the lecs effective area increases from 1 to 2 kev , the pspc area decreases in the same range ) this is the lecs range which is more appropriate for a quantitative comparison with the pspc . for the pg  1226@xmath6023 and pg  1202@xmath6281 fits we have added an edge at 0.6 kev and 0.8 kev respectively in the model .",
    "the resulting energy indices ( @xmath31 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of the pspc ones , together with the @xmath32(pspc ) line . to increase the sample we have added four bl lacertae objects observed by bepposax ( wolter et al .",
    "bl lacs objects usually do not show large neutral or ionized low energy absorption ( unlike seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies ) the four bl lacs were selected from the ten of the wolter et al .",
    "sample , excluding the objects with a complex ( or variable ) soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "a systematic difference between the lecs and pspc spectral indices is again evident .",
    "the bepposax soft spectral indices vs the pspc ones can be well fitted by a line with slope _",
    "m_=0.97@xmath40.10 and offset @xmath33=-0.23@xmath40.16 . fixing _",
    "m _ to 1 gives a constant difference between the two detectors measurements of @xmath34 .",
    "excluding the most discrepant point makes a marginal difference .",
    "this discrepancy is smaller than that found between the pspc and the einstein ipc ( @xmath35=0.5 ; fiore et al .",
    "1994 ) and the one between the pspc and the asca sis ( @xmath36 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1999 ) . in these latter two cases",
    "part of the difference can be due to the fact that the common energy range between these instruments is not large .",
    "conversely , the energy range shared by the pspc and the lecs is wide ( 0.12 kev ) , and , in particular , both instruments have good sensitivity below the carbon edge at 0.28 kev .",
    "their comparison is therefore more straightforward .",
    "however , if quasar spectra deviate from the simple power law , a small difference in the spectral index measured by the two instruments , that look at different average energies , could be possible . in order to check this effect",
    "we have fitted the lecs and pspc spectra of the quasars with the best photon statistics simultaneously with curved models ( broken power law and the power law with energy index variable with energy presented in laor et al 1994 ) , allowing for a different normalization in the two instruments and letting the model parameters linked together .",
    "the discrepancy in the estimated spectral index of about 0.2 could result from the differences in instrument response functions coupled with an energy dependent spectral slope at 0.12 kev ( with a reasonable curvature ) in about half of the cases .",
    "it is unclear then that the pspc and bepposax results are always inconsistent .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the bepposax 2 kev luminosity as a function of the pspc 2 kev luminosity .",
    "six quasars have bepposax luminosities slightly higher than pspc luminosity : the bepposax average luminosity is 30 % higher than the pspc one .",
    "variability can certainly play a role in this difference , given the small sample of objects .",
    "however we note that 2 kev are the limit of the pspc band and therefore a small uncertainty on the pspc spectral shape could translate in a relatively large error on the 2 kev flux and luminosity . the slope of the correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is consistent with 1 , indicating that this possible shift should not alter the results of the correlations between luminosity and other quasar properties discussed in laor et al .",
