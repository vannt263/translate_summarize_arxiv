    "in this section partons are defined as the quanta in the wavefunction of a hadron , or dressed quark , when quantization is done on the light - cone and when light - cone gauge is used .",
    "the relationship between this `` quantum '' description and a picture where gluons are viewed in terms of a classical , or semiclassical , field in a hadron is then given .",
    "although the more classical description has limitations it also provides a useful and intuitive way to picture many aspects of a high density parton system in terms of strong field configurations .",
    "gluon saturation , in parton language , becomes a limit on the strength which the light - cone potential can reach , in the language of field configurations .",
    "consider the wavefunction of a quark at order  g  in qcd .",
    "the formula    @xmath1\\ ] ]    is illustrated in fig.1 and represents a dressed quark state in terms of a bare quark , the first term on the right - hand side of ( 1 ) , and a bare quark plus a gluon .",
    "n is a normalization factor , @xmath2 are the polarizations of the virtual gluon , and @xmath3 are the color indices of the gluon .",
    "we have suppressed the color indices for the quark and instead view @xmath4 as a @xmath5  x  @xmath5 matrix in quark color space with the quark state being a 3-spinor in color space .",
    "the integration in ( 1 ) is @xmath6 with @xmath7    recalling that in light - cone quantization momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 are kinematic while @xmath10plays the role of the hamiltonian , with @xmath11 for an on - shell zero mass particle , @xmath12 can be written from light - cone perturbation theory as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and where the free gluon field can be written as    @xmath15\\ ] ]    with    @xmath16 = \\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda^\\prime } \\delta_{cc^\\prime } \\delta^3(k - k^\\prime)\\ ] ]    and where @xmath17    it is useful to imagine the calculation done in a frame where @xmath18 is large and @xmath19 in which case    @xmath20    in the soft gluon approximation ( the small - x approximation ) @xmath21 and this implies that @xmath22 thus the `` energy '' of the softest particle , the gluon , dominates the energy denominator in ( 2 ) . also , in @xmath23 light - cone gauge    @xmath24    and , again in the soft gluon approximation , one need keep only the @xmath25 term from ( 6 ) in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "thus , one finds    @xmath26    * problem 1(e ) : * use ( 2 ) along with ( 3)-(6 ) and @xmath27 to derive ( 7 ) .",
    "now define the gluon distribution of the quark by    @xmath28    which immediately gives    @xmath29    @xmath30    introducing an infrared cutoff , @xmath31 for the transverse momentum integral and using @xmath32 and @xmath33 one finally obtains    @xmath34    equation ( 8) is a natural and intuitive definition of the gluon distribution as it clearly corresponds to the number of gluons per unit of  x  in the wavefunction having transverse momentum less than q. the free integration of @xmath35 in ( 8) for @xmath36 can be viewed as determining that the gluon , and the quark from which it came , are point - like and localized down to a transverse size @xmath37 we note that if one takes @xmath38 one obtains a result for the proton which is not unreasonable phenomenologically for @xmath39 and moderate @xmath40 if @xmath41 is taken to be 100 mev .",
    "one can associate a `` classical '' field with the gluon in the quark according to    @xmath42    or , for @xmath43    @xmath44    it is then natural to define the `` classical '' field in momentum space to be    @xmath45    * problem 2(m ) : * take @xmath46 in ( 12 ) and show that @xmath47 * problem 3(m - h ) : * derive ( 12 ) using the feynman graph in fig.2 along with the light - cone gauge propagator @xmath48\\ { \\rm where}\\ \\ \\   \\eta\\cdot v = v_+$ ] for any vector @xmath49    * problem 4(e ) : * show that @xmath50 as given in ( 9 ) , can be obtained from @xmath51    the @xmath52 prescriptions in problems 2 and 3 may seem a little unusual .",
    "we shall have more to say about this later on .",
    "the fact that the @xmath52 s are different in the two @xmath53 denominators in the propagator in problem 3 , however , is necessary for consistency .",
    "if we orient the gluon momentum according to the arrow in fig.2 then the @xmath54 corresponds to the case that the @xmath55 carries the index at the tail of the arrow .",
    "this uniquely prescribes how the @xmath52 s are to be given .",
    "finally , problem 4 shows that the gluon distribution can be written in terms of the `` classical '' gauge potential a quantity intimately connected with the @xmath56integral of the field strength as is clear from problem 2 .",
    "the classical field we have defined here for gluons is identical , except for the color matrix @xmath57 to that which one naturally defines for photons in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "a quark can emit , or absorb , a gluon and remain a quark , however , a proton can not .",
    "thus we generalize the idea of a classical gluon field in a proton@xcite , and instead of the result given in problem 2 we take    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the quark color charge density operator for the proton .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a matrix notation for the gauge potential where @xmath60 and @xmath61.$ ] thus in matrix notation    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    the integration over   @xmath65   in ( 14 ) - ( 17 ) goes over the volume of the proton with @xmath66 the usual transverse coordinate and @xmath67 the light - cone analog of the usual z - coordinate . we shall only use ( 15 ) , or ( 16 ) , for transverse wavelengths much smaller than the radius of the proton in which case we may make @xmath59 more precise by writing@xcite    @xmath68    for the charge - charge correlator in the proton where @xmath69 is the quark number density normalized according to    @xmath70    of course ( 18 ) simply reflects the fact that for short transverse spatial separations only individual quarks are effective while ( 19 ) reflects the fact that we are working in a valence quark model@xcite , and that we do not consider the evolution in the proton which would produce either a quark sea or gluons additional to those which will couple to @xmath59 through ( 15 ) and ( 16 )",
    "that is we shall only allow two gluons to be emitted or absorbed in a proton . finally , when @xmath71 is sufficiently negative    @xmath72    with @xmath40 identified with @xmath73 equation ( 20 ) shows that we can recover the gluon distribution in a nucleon , as given by the independent gluon distributions of the valence quarks , in terms of the `` classical '' gluon field we defined in ( 14 ) .",
    "* problem 5(e ) : derive ( 20 ) *      now we wish to find @xmath74 for a large nucleus .",
    "we suppose that @xmath74 is small for a nucleon , but for a large nucleus @xmath74 , the light -cone gauge potential , will be large and non - linearities will have to be taken into account .",
    "it is these non - linearities which lead to the idea of gluon saturation .",
    "our approach is the following . in a nucleus",
    "it is well - known that interactions between the nucleons are short range and , to a good approximation , these interactions are weak enough , because of the diluteness of nuclear matter , that they may be neglected altogether in scattering hadrons and real and virtual photons on nuclei .",
    "if we express the gluon field of a nucleon in a covariant gauge then the gluon field will decrease reasonably rapidly outside a nucleon , even without having a model of confinement , due to the color neutrality of the nucleon .",
    "thus we are going to assume that the `` classical '' gluon field of a nucleus is additive in the nucleons in covariant gauge and then transform that result to light - cone gauge where it no longer will be additive , but where the partonic interpretation will be manifest@xcite .",
    "we begin by noting that in a covariant , lorentz , gauge the classical field of a quark becomes    @xmath75;\\ a_i^\\prime = a_-^\\prime=0\\ ] ]    instead of that given in problem 2 . *",
    "problem 6(e ) : * show that the same @xmath76 as given in problem 2 can be obtained from @xmath77    the lorentz gauge potential for a nucleon is then given by    @xmath78\\hat{\\rho}(\\underline{b},x_-)\\ ] ]    with the @xmath79 the same as in ( 15 ) and ( 18 ) .",
    "the infrared cutoff , @xmath80 in ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) will disappear when physical quantities are evaluated .",
    "now we take the lorentz gauge potential for a large nucleus simply by adding the contributions from the individual nucleons as given in ( 22 ) . in order to transform this result to light - cone gauge we use the general formula for changing gauges in qcd    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is a ( space - time dependent ) unitary transformation to be determined . in order that @xmath83 correspond to a light - cone gauge potential we require @xmath23 in ( 23 ) which gives    @xmath84    equation ( 24 ) is easily solved as    @xmath85    where the   @xmath86  symbol in ( 25 ) indicates that one should order the matrices @xmath87 so that @xmath88 comes to the right ( left ) of @xmath89 in case @xmath90 is greater ( less ) than @xmath91 the choice of writing the path integral from @xmath92 to @xmath93 corresponds to the choice of @xmath94 in the light - cone denominators in problems 2 and 3 and in ( 16 ) .",
    "now that @xmath82 has been determined in terms of the lorentz gauge potential we go back to ( 23 ) to get @xmath95 the first term on the right - hand side of ( 23 ) is not large since it is just a unitary transformation of the lorentz gauge potential . the large term is    @xmath96    leading to@xcite    @xmath97    where @xmath82 is given by ( 25 ) with @xmath87 given by ( 22 ) .",
    "the evaluation of ( 26 ) is a bit technical and we just outline the steps here@xcite .",
    "we begin by assuming our `` nucleus '' is just a thin slice in the @xmath98 direction .",
    "then , later , we will assemble the various slices to get the total result for spherical nucleus .",

    "now it is straightforward to find , still for a thin slice of nuclear matter ,    @xmath105    @xmath106    with @xmath107 the gluon distribution in a nucleon and where now @xmath69 is the normal nucleon number density in the nucleus a factor of @xmath108 times the @xmath109 which appears in ( 27 ) .",
    "it is now straightforward to go to a thick nucleus by simply exponentiating the second term in brackets on the right - hand side of ( 19 ) .",
    "thus if we call    @xmath110    then@xcite    @xmath111\\ ] ]    where the saturation momentum , @xmath112 , is given by    @xmath113    * problem 7(m - h ) : * derive ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , from ( 18 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) .",
    "the derivation of ( 28 ) from ( 18 ) and ( 27 ) is not hard but requires good bookkeeping skills along with the result of problem 8 . *",
    "problem 8(h ) : * show that for small @xmath114    @xmath115\\rho(\\underline{b}^\\prime , b_-)\\ ] ]    @xmath116      it is tempting to identify @xmath117 with @xmath118 as was done in ( 20 ) for the nucleon . this identification is correct if @xmath119 lies far above @xmath120 but it is not correct for @xmath40 below @xmath121 what we have actually been calculating is the number density of gluons in the nuclear fock space wavefunction .",
    "so long as @xmath122 is much greater than one this number density agrees with that measured in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "however , the gluons in the nuclear wavefunction have been rearranged in transverse momentum compared to what a simple superposition of nucleon gluon densities would suggest and at the semiclassical level we are now working the gluon distribution as defined by the operator product expansion , and as measured in deep inelastic scattering , is still additive .",
    "thus    @xmath123    is the number of gluons per unit transverse momentum in the nuclear wavefunction while    @xmath124    is the number of gluons per unit of transverse phase space in the wavefunction of the nucleus . *",
    "problem 9(m ) : * show that the total number of gluons in the nucleon wavefunction , the integral of ( 33 ) over all @xmath65 and @xmath125 , is simply the sum of the number of gluons in each of the nucleon wavefunctions even though the distribution of gluons in @xmath126 has been modified from a simple additive rule .",
    "in particular , this means that there is no shadowing in the mclerran - venugopalan model .",
    "the result in problem 9 shows that saturation and nuclear shadowing are very different phenomena .",
    "saturation is apparent in@xcite    @xmath127    which follows from ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) and which says that the light - cone gauge potential never becomes larger than    @xmath128    the `` ultimate '' value of the potential allowed before gluonic `` interactions '' move gluons from lower transverse momenta to higher transverse momenta . we shall come back to discuss saturation in a more general context , and especially for quark densities , in the third chapter of these lectures .",
    "dokshitzer , gribov , lipatov , altarelli and parisi ( dglap)@xcite evolution and balitsky , fadin , kuraev and lipatov ( bfkl)@xcite evolution tell how to go from a ( given ) coarse - grained description of partons in the wavefunction to a more fine - grained description . in the case of dglap evolution , which is equivalent to the usual renormalization group evolution , one passes from a coarse - grained description in @xmath129 ( or in @xmath130 ) to a more fine - grained description in @xmath129(or in @xmath130 ) , while in bfkl evolution one moves from a coarse - grained description in @xmath131 ( or in @xmath132 ) to a more fine - grained , shorter time , description .",
    "recall , from ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) we found an expression for @xmath133 clearly this expression obeys the equation    @xmath134    if we interpret ( 35 ) as telling us how many gluons come from a single quark in a given small transverse momentum bin ( see ( 9 ) ) then we can generalize this equation easily to the general distribution of gluons in a proton according to    @xmath135    in the first term on the right - hand side of ( 37 ) the @xmath136 factor is exactly as in ( 36 ) while the factor multiplying @xmath136 is the number of quarks ( and antiquarks ) having longitudinal momentum greater than the gluon emitted .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of ( 37 ) corresponds to emission of the `` observed '' gluon off higher longitudinal momentum gluons and @xmath137 naturally replaces @xmath138 * problem 10(h ) : * drop the @xmath139 term in ( 37 ) and solve for @xmath140 in the small - x and large-@xmath40 limit , in the leading double logarithmic approximation .",

    "the onium wavefunction having a single soft gluon , along with the heavy quark - antiquark , is calculated from the graphs in fig.4 , where softness means @xmath165 in the large @xmath0 limit the emission of a gluon changes a dipole into two dipoles .",
    "the original dipole , the heavy quark - antiquark pair , becomes two dipoles consisting of the heavy quark and the antiquark part of the gluon making up the first dipole and the quark part of the gluon along with the heavy antiquark making up the second dipole .",
    "we illustrate the sum of the two graphs in fig.4 by the single graph of fig.5 where the dipole structure is emphasized .    in order to derive the bfkl equation one needs only to calculate the graphs of fig.4 in light - cone gauge where the polarization of the gluon is    @xmath166    in the soft gluon approximation , which corresponds to the usual leading logarithmic approximation in which bfkl dynamics is formulated ,",
    "one need only keep @xmath25 in ( 42 ) because the @xmath167 is a large quantity . using the fact that the @xmath168 polarization couples to the classical current of a high momentum quark or antiqark we can immediately write down the contribution of the graphs in fig.4 to the wavefunction of the onium as    @xmath169    where @xmath170 is the color matrix for a gluon of color @xmath171 and @xmath172^{-1}$ ] is the energy denominator which is dominated by the soft gluon . going to transverse coordinate space by    @xmath173    one finds , using ( 43 ) ,    @xmath174    squaring and taking a trace over colors gives    @xmath175    in obtaining ( 46 ) we have taken @xmath176 in the large @xmath0 limit . * problem 12(e ) : * show    @xmath177 ^ 2 = { x_{01}^2\\over x_{12}^2 x_{02}^2}.\\ ] ]    including a phase space factor    @xmath178    one arrives at the factor    @xmath179    as the probability of emitting a soft gluon , and where we have defined @xmath180 eq.(47 )",
    "is illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "once a single soft gluon emission has been calculated it is straightforward to add more , even softer gluons .",
    "the time sequence for soft gluons to appear in the wavefunction follows their longitudinal momentum .",
    "the hardest of the soft gluons appears first , then the next hardest of the soft gluons , etc . in each case",
    "the emission of a soft gluon creates a transition from a color dipole to two color dipoles with the probability factor given by ( 47 ) . in order to express this most",

    "the parton picture of deep inelastic scattering is not manifest , however , unitarity constraints are manifest@xcite . in particular",
    "when a virtual photon breaks up into a quark - antiquark pair having a definite transverse coordinate separation , @xmath241 and at a definite impact parameter , @xmath242 that pair scatters off the proton or nucleus with an s - matrix element @xmath243 which obeys @xmath244 we shall see that @xmath245 corresponds to saturation .",
    "thus saturation ( bjorken frame ) corresponds to blackness of the cross section ( dipole frame ) .      to illustrate how quark saturation comes about consider deep inelastic scattering off a large nucleus in the dipole frame .",
    "we simplify the problem by only allowing the individual nucleons of the nucleus to interact with the quark - antiquark pair either through one gluon exchange , an inelastic reaction , or through two gluon exchange .",
    "we do not allow evolution in the individual nucleons so one may view this model as an extension of the mclerran - venugopalan model where now we have a ( quantum ) quark - antiquark pair interacting with the quasiclassical gluon field@xcite of the nucleus which we calculated in chapter 1 .",
    "however , since the nucleons in the nucleus do not have any evolution we can also simply take the nucleus at rest in which case the cross section takes the form of a virtual photon breaking into a quark - antiquark pair which then multiply scatters , via one and two gluon exchange , with the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "this view is illustrated in fig.12 .            and the fact that @xmath248 are the cross sections for transverse and longitudinal photons , respectively ) one can directly write a a formula for the quark and antiquark distributions in terms of the cross section for virtual photon scattering on the nucleus .",
    "in fact , we wish to go somewhat beyond this and write a formula for the measurement of a leading ( current ) jet in the deep inelastic scattering the equation is@xcite                the various factors in ( 70 ) have a ready explanation .",
    "the factor of @xmath255 comes from ( 68 ) relating a structure function ( or parton distribution ) to a virtual photon cross section .",
    "the wavefunctions give the amplitude , and complex conjugate amplitude , for a virtual photon to go into a quark - antiquark pair with momentum fractions @xmath256 and @xmath257 and at transverse coordinate separation @xmath258 in the amplitude and @xmath259 in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "the integration over @xmath260 and @xmath261 along with the @xmath262 factor fix the transverse momentum of the quark ( or antiquark ) to be @xmath263 the factors in the square bracket represent ( respectively ) no scattering of the pair , scattering in the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude , scattering in the amplitude , and scattering in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "the exponential factors in the [ ] are recognizable as multiple scatterings if one identifies      with @xmath109 the usual nucleon density and @xmath265 the cross section of a quark - antiquark dipole of separation @xmath266 on a nucleon .",
    "the @xmath267 in front of the @xmath268 in ( 70 ) is for normalization and means we are describing the jet rate for a single transversely polarized virtual photon .        which says there is @xmath272 quarks , or antiquarks , per unit of transverse phase space in the wavefunction of the nucleus",
    "this is quark saturation .",
    "this result follows from the unitarity of the dipole - nucleus scattering .          emerges .",
    "we have in fact reached what is essentially the golec - biernat and wsthoff model@xcite a model of saturation successfully applied to both structure functions and diffractive producton .",
    "the identification is complete if we identify @xmath275  and  @xmath276 golec - biernat and wsthoff do not do their analysis in impact parameter space but introduce a parameter setting the scale for cross sections , @xmath277 which is about 25 mb in their fits .",
    "they also parameterize @xmath278 with @xmath279  and @xmath280 the fact that they are able to get such good fits of the data at low and moderate @xmath40 for @xmath237 and for diffractive structure functions is , perhaps , the strongest evidence that saturation has been reached in the hera energy range .",
    "although ( 70 ) and ( 75 ) have been derived for scattering on a large nucleus the picture would seem to be pretty general .",
    "all the qcd dynamics is in the four factors in the [ ] in ( 70 ) .",
    "the identification of the exponential with the s - matrix according to      means we may everywhere replace the gaussian exponential factors by the s - matrix and have a very general description of deep inelastic scattering , on either a proton or a nucleus , where unitarity is controlled . the essential physics which the golec - biernat and wsthoff model incorporates is            although the golec - biernat and wsthoff model gives the strongest evidence for saturation i would like to go over the argument in a very qualitative way because the issue is so important and because the physics argument , though not technically difficult , is subtle .",
    "in general fits to @xmath285 using a second order dglap formalism work very well in the hera regime .",
    "however , there are signs that all is not well with such fits in the region of very small x and moderate values of @xmath286 in addition there is evidence that something like saturation is needed in order to be consistent with the energy dependence of diffractive structure functions measured at hera .",
    "we begin with @xmath287 sometime ago a. caldwell@xcite presented evidence for a change in the @xmath288 dependence of @xmath237 at very small  @xmath132  and moderate @xmath286 the hera data is shown in fig.13 where an unexpected turnover in @xmath289 occurs at moderate @xmath40 and small @xmath290 data through a similar region of @xmath291 but at much larger values of @xmath132 from fixed target experiments are shown in fig.14 where there is no turnover visible at moderate @xmath286 this turnover is well described by a formula like that given in ( 75 ) , that is by the model of golec - biernat and wsthoff .",
    "let us here try to describe what may be happening in very simple terms@xcite .",
    "so that @xmath40 cancels out in ( 79 ) and one is left with the usual @xmath297 integral giving scaling violations . in this case @xmath298",
    "@xmath299 and one would interpret the turnover in the caldwell plot as a ( surprising ) decrease in the gluon distribution at very low values of @xmath290 however , if @xmath300 is in the saturation regime      with @xmath302 about the proton s radius , since the unitarity limit is being reached .",
    "this means that @xmath303 and the turnover at small @xmath40 is seen as a natural result of unitarity , or saturation .",
    "it would be expected that unitarity , and saturation , should occur earlier for small impact parameter interactions than for large impact parameter interactions .",
    "it would be very interesting to be able to do analysis of the @xmath288 dependence of structure functions at very small @xmath132 as a function of the impact parameter of the collision .",
    "the other process for which there is some evidence for saturation is in the diffractive cross section at hera@xcite .",
    "the picture again is as in fig.15 but where now the proton , p , must exchange at least two gluons , and remain in a color singlet , in order that a large rapidity gap emerge with the proton typically appearing in the final state at a small momentum transfer .",
    "one can write          with @xmath307 and with @xmath308 the mass of the diffractive state coming from the quark - antiquark pair . using ( 84 ) in ( 83 ) leads to a quadratically diverging infrared integration @xmath309 and this suggests that the process of diffraction at hera is a soft process .",
    "this was the common wisdom among theorists until a few years ago . what could happen to make the process semihard",
    "? if the saturation momentum is as large as a gev or a few gev then ( 84 ) applies for transverse momenta above the saturation regime .",
    "if @xmath310 is below the saturation regime one should use      in ( 83 ) .",
    "this means that the saturation momentum serves as the infrared cutoff for the `` divergent '' integral when ( 82 ) is used in ( 81 ) .",
    "if the saturation momentum is in the semihard regime ( 1 - 2 ) gev then the resulting process is not a soft process and one might expect an energy dependence which is stronger than that given by the soft pomeron .",
    "in fact the data support a fairly strong energy growth . if one writes      then both zeus and h1 find @xmath313 to be about a factor of 2 larger than that expected from soft pomeron exchange .",
    "what is unique about the scattering of a virtual photon on a hadron is that the virtual photon wavefunction is dominated by high transverse momentum states , in contrast to hadrons .",
    "if the unitarity limit , saturation , is reached in some range of transverse momentum the process simply proceeds to a higher region of transverse momentum . in diffraction of virtual photons the most important region of transverse momenta in the virtual photon s wavefunction",
    "should be just above the saturation momentum .",
