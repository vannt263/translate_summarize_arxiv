    "discrete - time quantum walks ( dtqws ) are unitary quantum automata and can be viewed as formal generalizations of classical random walks .",
    "they were first considered in a systematic way by meyer @xcite in the context of quantum computing , following the seminal work of feynman @xcite , who was looking for path discretizations to build a fermionic path integral , and aharonov @xcite , who pointed out the parallel with classical random walks .",
    "dtqws have been realized experimentally with a wide range of physical objects and setups @xcite , and are studied in a large variety of contexts , ranging from fundamental quantum physics @xcite to quantum algorithmics @xcite , solid - state physics @xcite and biophysics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently that the continuous limit of several dtqws defined on regular ( 1 + 1)d spacetime lattices coincides with the dynamics of dirac fermions coupled , not only to electric fields @xcite , but also to arbitrary non - abelian yang - mills gauge fields @xcite and to relativistic gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) @xcite are of great interest , both theoretically and experimentally , and their effects on dtqws are thus worth investigating .",
    "linear gws ressemble electromagnetic waves .",
    "in particular , gws can be expanded as a superposition of plane waves and each plane wave as a superposition of two polarization states , both polarizations being perpendicular to the direction of propagation .",
    "the effect of these plane gws on matter is thus typically studied in the polarization plane and it makes little sense to envisage the action of gws on @xmath1d dtqws . performing a valid study of how gws influence dtqws thus requires building dtqws coupled to ( 1 + 2)d gravitational fields .",
    "we start by presenting a new family of @xmath0d dtqws whose continuous limit coincides with the dynamics of a dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary ( 1 + 2)d gravitational fields .",
    "the construction of this family is inspired by the @xmath1d construction presented in @xcite .",
    "the dtqws in the @xmath0d spacetime depend on two parameters , which code for the mass of the walker and for the finite spacing of the lattice , and on four time- and space - dependent angles .",
    "we then show how to choose these four angles to describe linear gws .",
    "we finally focus on pure shear gws , which couple the dynamics in the two directions of the spatial lattice , and examine in detail their action on the dtqws .",
    "our main results are the following . on large spatial scales , pure shear gws do not modify the polarizations of the fermion eigen - modes , but rescale all energies by a common factor . on smaller scales typically comparable to two or three lattice steps , both polarizations and energies",
    "are modified in a non - trivial way .",
    "this effect is particularly salient on interference patterns between the fermion eigen - modes .",
    "a final section discusses the construction of the dtqws and mentions several avenues open to further study .",
    "consider a quantum walker moving on a two - dimensional lattice ( discrete space ) with nodes labelled by @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 label discrete time and @xmath4 be a certain time- and position - independent basis of the two - dimensional coin hilbert space of the walker , which will be used implicitly in the rest of the paper .",

    "this operator controls the entire dtqw dynamics .",
    "in particular , at time @xmath145 , the energies corresponding to any given @xmath146 are the eigenvalues of @xmath138 and the associated eigenvectors define the eigen - polarizations of the spin-@xmath74 fermion .",
    "thus , a generic shear gw changes in a time - dependent way the polarization and the energy of the quantum walker .",
    "the only modes which are not affected by pure shear gws are those for which both @xmath147 and @xmath148 vanish .",

    "for all these wave vectors , the unperturbed operator @xmath153 coincides with unity .",
    "thus , the only modes on which a shear gw has no influence are those which are unaffected by the dynamics of the unperturbed ( _ i.e. _ ` free ' ) dtqw .",
    "they are all ` small - scale ' ( _ i.e. _ of the same order of magnitude as the lattice spacing ) except the @xmath154 mode , which corresponds to a uniform wave function .",

    "we will now present in detail two examples .",
    "the first one deals with large - scale modes _",
    "i.e. _ modes which vary on scales much larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "the other example is not restricted to large - scale modes and shows how the interference pattern between two fermion eigen - polarizations is changed by a gw .",
    "large scales are those relevant to the continuous limit and correspond to values of @xmath162 and @xmath163 close to zero .",
    "one finds , at first order in @xmath162 and @xmath163 : @xmath164 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenvalues @xmath165 and associated eigenvectors of this operator read , at first order in @xmath96 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 : @xmath166 and @xmath167,\\ ] ] which do not actually depend on @xmath96 and @xmath168 . since the eigen - energies",
    "@xmath169 are by definition related to the eigenvalues @xmath165 by @xmath170 , one finds that , at first order in @xmath96 : @xmath171    thus , at large scales , the lowest - order effect of the pure shear gw is simply to dilate space isotropically by a factor @xmath172 .",
    "this changes the eigen - energies accordingly , but not the polarization of the associated eigen - spinors .",
    "as mentionned above , a shear gw generically changes both the frequency and the polarization of a fermion eigen - mode .",
    "one way to visualize this effect in a physically meaningful manner is to show how gws modify the interference patterns between two fermion eigen - modes .",
    "consider for example the two wave vectors @xmath173 and @xmath174 and the two initial polarizations @xmath175 \\nonumber \\\\ \\psi^{2 } & = & \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } -\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\end{array } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first is an eigen - polarization of @xmath176 , associated to the eigenvalue @xmath177 and the second is an eigen - polarization of @xmath178 , associated to the eigenvalue @xmath179 .",
    "in particular , both eigenvalues are the same if @xmath180 and the free dtqw then does not modify the interference pattern of the two fermion eigen - modes .",
    "this is not so anymore in the presence of a gw , which changes the interference pattern at each time step @xmath5 by a contribution proportional to @xmath181 .",
    "let @xmath182 be the initial density of the two interfering fermion eigen - modes with @xmath180 and @xmath183 the density after one time step of the dtqw .",
    "the interesting quantity is the relative density difference per unit @xmath184 _ i.e. _ @xmath185 a direct computation shows that @xmath186 and @xmath187    figure 2 shows contours of @xmath182 and @xmath188 in the @xmath189 plane for @xmath190 , which corresponds to the maximum effect of the gw ( see below ) .",
    "both @xmath182 and @xmath188 depend on @xmath122 and @xmath123 only through @xmath191 .",
    "figure 3 shows how the profile of @xmath192 as a function of @xmath193 changes with @xmath194 .",
    "the net effect of the gw can be measured by @xmath195 .",
    "one finds that : @xmath196 this function is even in @xmath194 and symmetric with respect to @xmath190 .",
    "figure 4 displays its profile on the interval @xmath197 .",
    "the absolute maximum of @xmath198 is reached for @xmath190 , which corresponds to an original wave vector @xmath199 _ i.e. _ to twice the scale of the lattice spacing .",
    "the factor @xmath200 with respect to the lattice spacing comes from the fact that the dtqw makes two jumps in each direction at each time step .",
    "the function @xmath201 admits two local maxima , situated approximately at @xmath202 and @xmath203 , which are much smaller than the absolute maximum at @xmath190 .",
    "the function @xmath201 tends to zero with @xmath194 _ i.e. _ at large spatial scales .",
    "this is so because the interfering polarizations have identical energy in the absence of gws and we have seen in the preceding section that the only effect gws at large scales is to multiply all energies by a common factor , and this does not change the interference pattern of the two waves under consideration .",
    "finally , @xmath201 vanishes for @xmath204 , @xmath205 and for @xmath161 _ i.e. _ for the original wave number @xmath206 , which corresponds to the lattice spacing .     and of the the relative density variation @xmath207 in the @xmath189 plane .",
    "the mesh represents the lattice on which the dtqw is defined . ]     and of the the relative density variation @xmath207 in the @xmath189 plane .",
    "the mesh represents the lattice on which the dtqw is defined . ]     as a function of @xmath193 for various values of @xmath194 . ]",
    "we have introduced new two - dimensional dtqws whose continuous limit coincides with the dynamics of massive spin-1/2 dirac fermions propagating in a curved spacetime .",
    "we have then shown how to use these dtqws to simulate the influence of gws on dirac fermions .",
    "we have finally focused on pure shear gws and investigated in detail how these influence dtqws on both large and small scales . on large spatial scales ,",
    "pure shear gws do not modify the polarizations of fermion eigen - modes , but rescale all energies by a common factor . on smaller scales typically comparable to two or three lattice steps , both polarizations and energies",
    "are modified in a non - trivial way .",
    "this effect is particularly salient on interference patterns between fermion eigen - modes .",
    "let us now discuss various aspects of our work .",
    "the new ( 1 + 2)d dtqws introduced in this paper are strongly inspired by the ( 1 + 1)d dtqws introduced in @xcite . as shown this earlier work , the coupling of a dtqw with a gravitational field in ( 1 + 1)d can only be retained if the walker performs at each time - step not one , but two jumps in the spatial direction .",
    "thus , one would expect that coupling dtqws with gravitational fields in ( 1 + 2)d could be obtained by letting the walker perform two jumps in each spatial direction at each time - step .",
    "these jumps are represented by the operators @xmath208 and @xmath209 which we will discuss in more detail below .",
    "these @xmath210 jumps however do not suffice and do not take into account the shear generated by generic gravitational fields .",
    "this shear couples directions and manifest itself by non - diagonal metric coefficients which do not vanish identically . to take the shear into account",
    ", the quantum walker has to perform two extra jumps in each direction at each time - step .",
    "these two extra - jumps are represented by the operators @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "now , choosing any given representation of the ( 1 + 2)d clifford algebra implies breaking the symmetry between the two space directions @xmath213 and @xmath214 and the operator @xmath22 is included to trace this symmetry breaking .",
    "the operator @xmath215 endows the dtqw with a mass @xmath13 and provides the ` mass - like ' extra - term @xmath216 which is present in the ( 1 + 2)d dirac equation .",
    "the operators @xmath217 themselves deserve some more comments .",
    "each operator involves two jumps ( represented by the operators @xmath27 s ) and two mixing operators ( represented by the @xmath30 s ) . as shown in @xcite for the @xmath1d , involving only these operations would deliver the correct dirac dynamics in the continuous limit , but not in a standard ` fixed ' spin basis .",
    "the operators @xmath218 and @xmath29 compensate for this basis difference .",
    "dtqws simulating the interaction of a dirac field with a gravitational one can also be constructed in a different way .",
    "the other construction was presented in @xcite for the ( 1 + 1)d case and an extension to higher space - time dimensions has just been completed .",
    "this extension also allows fermions to have internal degrees of freedom .",
    "both constructions use a regular lattice , but they differ in nearly all other aspects .",
    "the construction of dtqws used in this paper is tailor - made to deliver dtqws whose continuous limit coincides with the dirac equation .",
    "the other construction considers very general unitary quantum automata in large - enough hilbert spaces .",
    "these admit a whole class of pdes as continuous limits , including the dirac equation . as a consequence",
    ", each construction has its pros and cons , which we shall now discuss .",
    "as apparent from the above material , our construction works only in synchronous coordinate systems , for which all mixed time - space metric components identically vanish and the time - time component is identical to unity .",
    "this does not restrict the gravitational fields one can take into account , since all gravitational fields admit local synchronous coordinates .",
    "but it forces the lattice to be regular in precisely these synchronous coordinates , whereas the other construction allows the lattice to be regular in arbitrary coordinates .    on the other hand , the time - advancement operator @xmath10 used in our construction only involves gauge - invariant _ i.e. _ intrinsic aspects of the gravitational fields , while the time - advancement operator used in the other construction mixes both gauge - invariant and gauge - dependent aspects of the gravitational field . thus ,",
    "if one adopts the construction used in this paper , the operator @xmath10 itself can be viewed as a discrete gauge - invariant gravitational field .",
    "the gauge dependence of standard continuous physics then manifests itself only in the choice of coordinates when one performs the continuous limit _",
    "i.e. _ in the correspondence between the continuous coordinates @xmath219 and the lattice indexes . on the other hand , the other construction encodes both the gauge - invariant aspects of the gravitational fields and a choice of coordinates into a single object _",
    "i.e. _ in the time - advancement operator .",
    "and one is still free to choose continuous coordinates as one wishes .",
    "also , the other construction requires doubling the number of components of the wave function , the reduction to the usual number of components appearing only in the continuous limit .",
    "in particular , our 2-component dtqw wave functions can be considered as discrete generalizations of the usual ( 1 + 2)d spinors , whereas the wave functions used in the other construction , having 4 instead of 2 components , are more like couples of spinors .",
    "it thus seems that both constructions have their own strong and weak points .",
    "the construction used in this paper is perhaps more physically grounded and the other one may be of more interest to computer scientists .",
    "let us finally mention of few extensions of this work .",
    "the first one is rather straightforward and consists in allowing the operators @xmath220 and @xmath221 to be arbitrary members of @xmath222 . the extra angles which will appear code for arbitrary discrete electromagnetic fields ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the other extension consists in incorporating in the model extra internal dimensions .",
    "this should in particular deliver dtqws where the time - advancement operator unifies arbitrary discrete yang - mills fields with discrete gravitational fields ( see @xcite for ( 1 + 1)d dtqws simulating dirac fermions in arbitrary yang - mills fields ) .",
