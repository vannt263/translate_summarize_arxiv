    "however , the physical explanation for such strong redshift dependence is still under question . in hierarchical models",
    ", @xmath8 should also be an epoch of major galaxy - cluster assembly , with numerous mergers and subcluster development ( _ eg : _ lacey & cole 1993 ; khochfar & burkert 2001 ; murali et al .",
    "the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters at @xmath11 is higher than in similar systems at @xmath12 @xcite and some studies suggest that star formation is suppressed in the centres of galaxy clusters relative to the field , at least out to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cores of galaxy clusters may show a deficit of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as well as strongly star - forming galaxies ( barr et al .",

    "the space density of agn also peaks at high redshift and declines after @xmath8 ( _ eg : _ boyle & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "so , environment may strongly influence both star formation and agn activity .",
    "magnitude - limited , spectroscopic field and cluster samples of strongly star - forming emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) become incomplete by @xmath10 . at this redshift and beyond ,",
    "narrow - band imaging techniques are more efficient at detecting elgs .",
    "narrow - band searches have a major advantage over magnitude - limited surveys in that they select objects directly on the basis of their star formation activity . at @xmath10 ,",
    "elgs typically have very faint continuum magnitudes , @xmath14 @xcite , and are unremarkable in broad - band images  if seen at all .",
    "indeed , studies have shown that magnitude - limited surveys can miss a substantial amount of star formation even at @xmath15 ( jones & bland - hawthorn 2001 ; hereafter jbh01 ) . to cover the large volumes needed for surveys of star - forming galaxies at moderate to high redshifts ,",
    "tunable - filter instruments offer an advantage over traditional monolithic filters in being able to target a wide range of wavelengths in contiguous passbands .",

    "the six quasars whose fields are targetted in this work are listed in table  [ tab : tobs ] and were chosen from the mqs parent sample purely according to criteria of observability .",
    "suitable redshifts are limited by the need to place [ oii ] inside the wavelength ranges accessible through the set of @xmath35 - wide ttf order - blocking filters .",

    "figure  [ fig : var ] shows this variation for the field of mrc  b2021208 , as well as a ` night - sky ring ' , caused by the radial sensitivity to emission from atmospheric oh . in order to measure this spatial dependence , the wavelength scale was calibrated at two positions ; images of a cuar or ne lamp spectrum were made in 9 pixels near the optical centre , where the wavelength sensitivity is at its reddest , and in the same number at the field edge .",
    "this was undertaken , over a range of @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath46 , before and after each data observation to mitigate any drift in the @xmath38,@xmath47 relation .",
    "the @xmath38,@xmath47 and @xmath48,@xmath47 relationships were thereby determined for each field and positions in @xmath49 space assigned the relevant wavelength solution .",
    "the change in wavelength sensitivity with spatial position causes different volumes to be sampled at different wavelengths . because of the proximity of the quasars to the optical centre in our images ,",
    "more volume is sampled blueward of the quasar redshift than redward .",
    "this is accounted for when determining number densities in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "flux calibrations were made by observing the spectrophotometric standards indicated in table [ tab : tobs ] .",
    "for runs a , c , d and e , exactly the same scan parameters were employed as were used in the science observations . for scans",
    "b and f , the standards were observed in a subset ( 2 or 3 ) of the @xmath38-values used in the science frames . in these latter cases",
    "the flux density was estimated assuming a linear relationship between the counts in the standard at different wavelengths .",
    "all data reduction and elg candidate selection algorithms detailed here were accomplished using idl including custom scripts from the idl astronomy users library as well as programs written by the authors .",
    "data reduction initially proceeded as it would for standard broad - band imaging .",
    "first the bias was removed from each image by subtracting the median of a bias frame or the median value of the overscan region .",
    "the data were flat - fielded at each @xmath38 value using twilight - sky flats for scans a , b , e and f and dome flats for scans c and d.    night - sky rings , caused by radial sensitivity to oh meinel bands ( see figure  [ fig : var ] ) , were removed by subtracting median values of the sky in concentric circles about the optical axis .",
    "these rings are actually ellipses , but for the etalon tilts and positions of the optical centres in this study are well approximated by circles . the night - sky rings were removed to within @xmath50 of the background level in the most affected images .",
    "images at a common @xmath38 value were aligned by comparing positions of bright stars and co - added .",
    "cosmic rays , bad pixels and ghosts were rejected .",
    "the positions of the cosmic rays in @xmath49 space were recorded in order to cross - correlate their occurrence with that of elgs at a later stage .",
    "object detection and aperture photometry was carried out using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts ) .",
    "objects were detected in two ways :    1 .",
    "sextractor was used to identify objects at each @xmath38 value in the scan separately and these were correlated by position after extraction .",
    "2 .   the images from each scan were summed together and sextractor was used to detect objects in this deep composite .    in both cases objects",
    "were identified as having 5 contiguous pixels at @xmath22 above noise in a median - smoothed image convolved with the scan s worst seeing .",
    "each method has its advantages in terms of locating elgs . in the first case objects which are present at some @xmath38 values but not others",
    "will not be diminished by the addition of extra noise . in the second instance",
    ", fainter continuum objects will be picked up , and the completeness limit of the catalogue will be deeper .",
    "these two methods were used purely to identify the positions at which to obtain aperture photometry in each image .",
    "photometry was then carried out using @xmath51 diameter apertures .",
    "the objects were calibrated to a flux scale ( erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 ) and ab magnitudes using the spectrophotometric standards indicated in table  [ tab : tobs ] .",
    "a small offset of typically 0.1 mag was applied to each object to correct for flux from the object falling outside the fixed aperture .",
    "this was calculated by comparing the magnitudes of a subset of @xmath42 objects measured within the @xmath51 apertures with the magnitudes measured in larger ( @xmath52 ) apertures .",
    "corrections for galactic extinction ( typically @xmath53 mag ) were made to each field using values from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "the two catalogues , compiled from objects in individual bands and those identified from the combined scan , were analysed separately for the presence of candidate emission - line galaxies .",
    "objects detected by sextractor at only one , two or three adjacent etalon values in the individual catalogues were identified first and set aside as elg candidates .",
    "this initial sweep separated those objects for which only line emission was detectable .",
    "the search then proceeded to objects with line emission superposed on a continuum .    for objects detected individually in four or more images , a straight line was fitted to their fluxes in each band .",
    "the rms scatter , @xmath54 , about the line and the mean flux error , @xmath55 , were evaluated and the larger taken as the dominant source of error , @xmath56 .",
    "the background was then fitted iteratively as a straight line , rejecting the points that fell more than @xmath56 above the line .",
    "a minimum of three points were retained to fit the background .",
    "objects with peaks @xmath57 above the fitted background were set aside as candidate line emitters .",
    "those @xmath38 values in which the flux was @xmath57 above the background were identified as ` line ' bands under two conditions :    1 .",
    "where there are two or more bands above the threshold , they should be adjacent .",
    "if only one band is above the threshold , the ( one or ) two images adjacent to it are classified as ` line ' bands .",
    "this is because line emission superposed on a detectable continuum is never narrow enough to be contained only in one @xmath40  wavelength slice .",
    "candidate elgs were also identified by considering the difference between the line and continuum magnitudes .",
    "elg candidates are identified as objects with brightest magnitudes separated by more than three times the error from the average continuum magnitude .",
    "the selection is illustrated in figure  [ fig : m_p ] for each field .",
    "a limit of @xmath58 is imposed on putative line emitters to avoid contamination of the sample at the bright end , where differences in luminosity between bands caused by light falling outside the small aperture become significant . at the redshifts probed by our sample",
    "we do not expect elgs with @xmath58 .",
    "this method was used successfully to find elgs in the field of mrc  b0450221 in paper 1 and in hall et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "all elg candidates were cross - checked in @xmath49 space with those of cosmic rays , and matches were excluded from the catalogue . generally , the same objects were extracted by each selection method . however , the overlap was not complete  an indication that some candidates are missed by each process ( see  [ sec : elginc ] ) .",
    "as a final check , all candidates were examined by eye to ensure that no unusual cosmic rays or low - level ghosts were categorised as elgs .",

    "it is estimated that 10 elg candidates are missed because their flux is below the completeness limit of the catalogue .",

    "caution must be exercised before we add candidates to our sample , or enhance our statistics .",

    "the strongest lines observed in these galaxies are generally due to h@xmath17@xmath380 , [ oii]@xmath0 and [ oiii]@xmath381 and an estimate of the number of these interlopers is required before we evaluate our statistics .",

    "this is because of the scatter in the empirical luminosity - sfr relationship and the large uncertainties ( at least a factor of 2 ) in the data of cowie et al . the number of interlopers shown in table  [ tab : int ] is further overestimated because of the restricted magnitude range of the detections ( @xmath386 ) .    at high redshifts , the deep survey of rhoads et al .",

    "hicks et al .",
    "this means that their contamination rate will not significantly affect the predictions for interlopers made above .",
    "these estimates assume that we can treat star - forming galaxies as a homogeneously distributed population , which , of course , is not the case .",
    "elgs are often found as multiples ( _ eg : _ hutchings et al .",
    "1993 ; hicks et al . 2002 ; venemans et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , accounting for this variance is very difficult as the clustering of star - formers over a range of redshift is not clearly mapped .",
    "the predicted rate of interloping h@xmath17 for most fields is @xmath378 , the expected number of [ oiii ] emitters is an upper limit based on the assumption that [ oiii ] traces sfr in the same way as [ oii ] , and imposing a magnitude cut at @xmath58 will cull lower redshift line emitters .",
    "therefore , we expect objects detected by our ttf observations primarily to be [ oii ] emitters .    the wavelength regions probed in this paper do not contain any sharp features that might arise in galactic stars , so stars will not be a significant contaminant .",

    "the wavelength solution was therefore adjusted 12redward to correct for the discrepancy .",

    "moreover , they appear to congregate to the sw of the quasar .",
    "this is the site of a cluster of galaxies found in barr ( 2003 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:2156_loc ] shows that , while the elg candidates appear near the red galaxy overdensity , they avoid the site of peak clustering .",
    "this supports the view that the edges , rather than cores of clusters of galaxies , are predominantly the sites of star formation activity .",
    "in this paper we have examined the fields of six quasars and find forty - seven new elg candidates .",
    "the number of candidates about each quasar varies from the number expected from field surveys ( _ eg : _ mrc  b2037324 ) to overdensities of @xmath40 times ( mrc  b0413210 , mrc  b1359281 ) .",
    "previous studies have shown that mrc  b2156245 resides on the edge of a rich cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the other five quasars have either not been examined for evidence of galaxy clustering ( due to observing constraints ) or have environmental richnesses consistent with the field @xcite .",
    "we now consider the elg properties and environments of all seven mqs quasars targetted with ttf , including the 17 elg candidates ( 3 spectroscopically confirmed ) detected in the field of mrc  b0450221 at @xmath418 described in paper 1 .",
    "clear evidence for a rich cluster of galaxies in the mrc  b0450221 field was presented in paper 1 .",
    "we note that followup spectroscopy is necessary to determine the nature of the elg candidates . for the forthcoming discussion",
    "we assume the line is indeed [ oii ] for all candidates except the two brightest objects in the field of mrc  b2021208 ( see  [ sec:2021 ] ) . in paper 1 ,",
    "spectroscopic follow - up found one low - redshift interloper out of seven targets , which agrees with the number expected from the analysis described in section [ sec : elgspu ] .",
    "therefore , as the determination of interlopers in this paper is essentially the same as that in paper 1 , no great diminution of the statistics presented here is expected .",
    "it is well known that radio - loud agn at moderate to high redshifts exhibit strong alignments between their optical - line and radio emission ( _ eg : _",
    "mccarthy 1993 ; rush et al .",
    "1997 ; axon et al .",
    "2000 ; hutchings , morris & crampton 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , extended [ oii ] emission is common around 3c quasars at comparable redshifts to the quasars in our sample ( _ eg : _ bremer et al .",
    "we note that evidence of such a phenomenon in this work exists for two sources ( mrc  b0413210 and mrc  b2156245 ) .",
    "however , the resolution of each image precludes detailed optical mapping of these regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : elg_dis ] plots the surface density of candidate [ oii ] emitters against projected distance from the quasar .",
    "there is a peak in the surface density of elg candidates within @xmath419 kpc of the quasars , and also a smaller overdensity at @xmath420 kpc from the quasar .",
    "the first signature appears to arise from elg close companions to the quasars , e.g. a pair of elgs lying within @xmath421 of mrc  b0106233 , and similarly for mrc  b0413210 .",
    "the latter excess occurs at distances consistent with the scale lengths of galaxy clusters about agn at these redshifts @xcite .    in the six new fields presented in this paper ,",
    "no further examples of strongly clustered elg groups similar to that seen in the field of mrc  b0450221 ( paper 1 ) are found , apart from the quasar companions .",
    "weak clustering of elg candidates is likely , but the small numbers preclude a detailed clustering analysis .",
    "for example , elg candidates are seen solely ne of mrc  b2021208 or sw of mrc  b2156245 .",
    "figure  [ fig : elg_v ] shows the distribution in velocity space of [ oii ] candidates detected with ttf about the quasars .",
    "the left panel indicates that the average space density of these objects from @xmath422 km s@xmath5 is @xmath423 mpc@xmath424 , ten times greater than the @xmath425 mpc@xmath424 expected from field surveys @xcite .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ fig : elg_v ] plots the number density _ vs _",
    "velocity histogram for mrc  b0450221 and mrc  b2156245 , two quasars known to reside in rich clusters of galaxies @xcite . these fields clearly show a large overdensity of elg candidates about the quasar redshift .",
    "the spread in velocities seen ( @xmath426 km s@xmath5 , by fitting a simple gaussian distribution ) is comparable with the average velocity dispersion for abell richness class 2 clusters of @xmath427 km s@xmath5 @xcite .      the observed equivalent widths for the elg candidates in this paper lie in the range @xmath428 , corresponding to @xmath429  in the rest frames of the quasars .",

    "also displayed is the luminosity function of local [ oii ] emitters @xcite as well as two representations of high - redshift field surveys of star - forming galaxies @xcite adjusted to our adopted cosmology .",

    "there is also a variation in the strength and number of elg candidates found about quasars , _ eg : _",
    "mrc  b2037234 has a number of line emitters consistent with no overdensity in contrast to the clear clustering of strong elg candidates near mrc  b2156245 .    to estimate the sfr from [ oii ] luminosity we use the empirical conversion of gallagher et al .",

    ". however , most estimators of sfr are reasonably insecure because the estimates are highly model dependent and include assumptions about the imf , metallicity and extinction ( see the review by kennicutt 1998 ) .    the resulting distribution of star formation rates is shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "the sfrs span a range of @xmath436 yr@xmath5 with a median value of @xmath437 yr@xmath5 , that is also consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts @xcite .",
    "caution must be exercised in interpreting the above results .",
    "vagaries in the basic properties of elgs at @xmath10 such as gas ionization and extinction make it difficult to compare samples selected using different methods . the empirical conversion from @xmath3([oii ] ) to sfr is uncertain , and there is variation in the number of elg candidates found per field , as well as a small number found overall . for these reasons ,",
    "any quantitative analysis of the luminosity function and star formation activity is likely to be equivocal .",
    "our data provide a comparison with the detections of line emitters of different types in the fields of agn at other redshifts .",
    "surveys of this type vary in depth and sensitivity but yield surprisingly consistent results .",
