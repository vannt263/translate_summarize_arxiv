    "in braneworld scenarios it is known that large extra dimensions can lower the fundamental scale of gravity down to the order of tev .",
    "this brings the possibility of creating microscopic black holes in high energy experiments such as the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite ( for a recent review on this topic and a complete list of references please refer to @xcite ) .",

    "hawking radiation serves as the chief arena for studying the quantum gravity and disclosing the signature of extra dimensions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other attempts on detecting the extra dimension have been investigated in the perturbations around braneworld black holes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most examinations for the extra dimension through hawking radiations and the wave dynamics are concentrated on braneworld black holes with zero brane tension .",
    "however the nonzero tension on the brane is not trivial , since it can curve the brane as well as the bulk . in general",
    "it is very hard to obtain exact solutions of higher - dimensional einstein equations describing black holes on the brane with tension .",
    "recently , a metric describing a black hole located on a three - brane with finite tension , embedded in locally flat six - dimensional spacetime was constructed in @xcite . hawking radiation @xcite and perturbations around this black hole",
    "@xcite have been studied subsequently , where modifications due to the finite brane tension and imprints of extra dimensions have been examined .",
    "further progress has been made by generalizing the schwarzschild like solution of @xcite to rotating black holes on a codimension-2 brane @xcite . including the rotation will bring richer physics . in hawking radiation the amplifications in various properties due to the rotation",
    "have been shown in @xcite where the brane tension was zero .",
    "it is of great interest to examine the evaporation of the rotating black holes on codimension-2 brane and investigate the physics brought by the rotation and the brane tension .",

    "we will discuss the evaporation of scalar field in six - dimensional black holes pierced by a tense 3-brane rotating orthogonal to the brane and along the brane .",
    "we will calculate the corresponding absorption probabilities and luminosity of hawking radiation analytically by employing the matching technique of combining the far - field and near - horizon parts of solutions in the low energy and angular momentum limit .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the following section we will derive the master equation in rotating black holes on codimension-2 branes . in sec.iii we will present the solution in the low energy and low angular momentum limit by using the matching technique . in sec.iv , we derive the absorption probability and the luminosity of hawking radiation . finally in the last section we present our conclusions",
