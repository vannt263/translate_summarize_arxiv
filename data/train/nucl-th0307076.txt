    "supernarrow dibaryons ( snds ) are 6-quark states , a decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "such dibaryons satisfy the following condition : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the isospin , @xmath3 is the internal spin , and @xmath4 is the dibaryon parity . these dibaryons with the masses ( @xmath5 ) is the nucleon ( pion ) mass ) can mainly decay by emitting a photon .",
    "this is a new class of dibaryons with the decay widths .",
    "the experimental discovery of such states would have important consequences for particle and nuclear physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the snds have been first experimentally observed in works @xcite with the masses @xmath6 , 1926 , and 1942 mev .",
    "unfortunately , existed theoretical models do not allow a correct calculation of dibaryon masses in the mass region under consideration .",
    "on the other hand , in the reactions @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite , connected with the snd production , peaks have been found in the missing mass spectra .",
    "these peaks have been interpreted in @xcite as a manifestation of new exotic baryons with anomaly small masses .",
    "the calculation of the masses of exotic baryons are usually realized in the framework of the quark cluster models @xcite . however , these models do not reproduce all baryon correctly enough . and",
    "although the question about the nature of these peaks is still open , it is important to construct a mass formula which allows a more correct analysis of them .    in the present paper",
    "we construct mass formulae for snds and exotic baryons . with this aim",
    "we calculate self energies of the snds and the exotic baryons in one loop approximation using dispersion relations with two subtractions .    in order to check an efficiency of this approach , the mass formula for the exotic baryons",
    "is also used to calculate the mass of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the application of the mass formulae constructed for a calculation of the masses of the snds and the exotic baryons results in a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the contents of the paper are the following . in section 2 and 3",
    "the works on the snds and the exotic baryons are reviewed , respectively . in section 4 the mass formula for exotic baryons",
    "is constructed and the equation obtained is used for the calculation of the mass of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the calculation of the masses of the exotic baryons is performed in section 5 .",
    "the construction of the mass formula for snds and the calculation their masses are given in section 6 .",
    "the main conclusion are given in section 7 .",
    "in works @xcite , the reactions @xmath7 and @xmath9 were studied with the aim of searching for snds .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the proton linear accelerator of inr with 305 mev proton beam using the two - arm spectrometer tams . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the nucleons and the deuteron from the snd decay into @xmath10 and @xmath11 have to be emitted in a narrow angle cone with respect to the direction of the dibaryon motion . on the other hand ,",
    "if a dibaryon mainly decays into two nucleons , then the expected angular cone of the emitted nucleons must be more than @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , a detection of the scattered proton in coincidence with the proton ( or the deuteron ) from the decay of the dibaryon at correlated angles allowed the authors to suppress the contribution of the background processes essentially and to increase the relative contribution of a possible snd production .",
    "several software cuts have been applied to the mass spectra in these works . in particular , the authors limited themselves by the consideration of an interval of the proton energy from the decay of the @xmath13 states , which was determined by the kinematics of the snd decay into @xmath10 channel .",
    "such a cut is very important as it provides an additional possibility to suppress essentially the contribution from the background reactions and random coincidences .    in @xcite , cd@xmath14 and @xmath15c",
    "were used as targets .",
    "the scattered proton was detected in the left arm of the spectrometer tams at the angle @xmath16 .",
    "the second charged particle ( either @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) was detected in the right arm by three telescopes located at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    as a result ,",
    "three narrow peaks in the missing mass @xmath22 spectra have been observed at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 mev with widths equal to the experimental resolution ( @xmath26 mev ) and with numbers of standard deviations of 6.0 , 7.0 , and 6.3 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the dibaryon peaks at @xmath27 and 1926 mev had been observed earlier by same authors in @xcite at somewhat different kinematical conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "no noticeable signal of dibaryons has been observed in the missing mass @xmath28 spectra of the reaction @xmath9 .",
    "the analysis of the angular distributions of the protons from the decay of the @xmath13 states and the suppression observed of the snd decay into @xmath11 showed that the peaks found can be explained as a manifestation of the isovector snds , the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "an additional information about the nature of the observed states was obtained by studying the missing mass @xmath29 spectra of the reaction @xmath7 .",
    "if the state found is a dibaryon mainly decaying into two nucleons then @xmath30 is a neutron and the mass @xmath29 is equal to the neutron mass @xmath31 .",
    "if the value of @xmath29 , obtained from the experiment , differs essentially from @xmath31 then @xmath32 and it is an additional indication that the dibaryon observed is the snd .",
    "the simulation of the missing mass @xmath29 spectra of the reaction @xmath7 has been performed @xcite assuming that the snd decays as snd@xmath33 through two - nucleon singlet state @xmath34 @xcite . as a result , three narrow peaks at @xmath35 , 987 , and 1003 mev have been predicted .",
    "these peaks correspond to the decay of the isovector snds with the masses 1904 , 1926 , and 1942 mev , respectively .    in the experimental missing mass @xmath29 spectrum besides the peak at the neutron mass caused by the process @xmath36 , a resonance - like behavior of the spectrum has been observed at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 mev @xcite .",
    "these values of @xmath29 coincide with the ones obtained from the simulation and essentially differ from the value of the neutron mass ( 939.6 mev ) . hence , for all states under study , one has @xmath32 in support of the statement that the dibaryons found are snds .    in @xcite dibaryons with exotic quantum numbers were searched for in the process @xmath40 .",
    "the experiment was performed with a proton beam from the jinr phasotron at an energy of about 216 mev .",
    "the energy spectrum of the photons emitted at @xmath41 was measured . as a result",
    ", two peaks have been observed in this spectrum .",
    "this behavior of the photon energy spectrum was interpreted as a signature of the exotic dibaryon resonance with the mass of about 1956 mev and a possible isospin @xmath42 .    on the other hand , an analysis @xcite of the uppsala proton - proton bremsstrahlung data looking for the presence of a dibaryon in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 mev gave only the upper limits of 10 and 3 nb for the dibaryon production cross section at proton beam energies of 200 and 310 mev , respectively .",
    "this result agrees with the estimates of the cross section obtained at the conditions of this experiment in the framework of the model suggested in @xcite and does not contradict to the data of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that if this dibaryon has @xmath42 then it could not be a snd , the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the decay of such a dibaryon into two nucleons is forbidden by the value of the isospin @xmath42 .",
    "the reactions @xmath43 and @xmath44 have been also investigated by tamii _",
    "_ @xcite at the research center for nuclear physics at the proton energy 295 mev in the mass region of 18961914 mev .",
    "they did not observe any narrow structure in this mass region and obtained the upper limit of the production cross section of a nn - decoupled dibaryon was equal to if the dibaryon decay width @xmath45 mev .",
    "this limit is smaller than the value of the cross section of declared in @xcite .",
    "however , the latter value was overestimated that was caused by not taking into account angle fluctuations related to a beam position displacement on the cd@xmath14 target during the run . as was shown in the next experimental runs , the real value of the cross sections of the production of the snd with the mass 1904 mev had to be smaller by 23 times than that was estimated in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the simulation showed that the energy distribution of the protons from the decay of the snd with the mass of 1904 mev has to be rather narrow with the maximum at @xmath46 mev .",
    "this distribution occupies the energy region of 6090 mev .",
    "the experiments @xcite confirmed the result of this simulation .",
    "however , in @xcite the authors considered the region 74130 mev .",
    "therefore , they could detect only a small part of the snd contribution .",
    "moreover , they used a very large acceptance of the spectrometer which detected these protons , while the protons under consideration have to fly in a very narrow angle cone . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of the effect to the background in this work is more than 10 times worse than in @xcite .",
    "very big errors and absence of a proper cut on the energy of the protons from the decay of the @xmath13 state in @xcite did not allow the the authors to observe any structure in the @xmath13 mass spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting that the reaction @xmath47 was investigated in other works too ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , in contrast to @xcite , the authors of these works did not study either the correlation between the parameters of the scattered proton and the second detected particle or the emission of the photon from the dibaryon decay .",
    "therefore , in these works the relative contribution of the dibaryons under consideration was very small , which hampered their observation .",
    "now let us consider the attempts to calculate masses of snds and determine their quantum numbers .    in the framework of the mit bag model , mulders et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the masses of different dibaryons , in particular , @xmath48-decoupled dibaryons .",
    "they predicted dibaryons @xmath49 gev )  and @xmath50 gev ) corresponding to the forbidden states @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the @xmath48 channel .",
    "however , the dibaryon masses obtained exceed the pion production threshold . therefore , these dibaryons mainly decay into the @xmath53 channel .    using the chiral soliton model ,",
    "kopeliovich @xcite predicted that the masses of @xmath54 and @xmath55 dibaryons exceeded the two nucleon mass by 60 and 90 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are lower than the pion production threshold .    in the framework of the canonically quantized biskyrmion model krupnovnickas _",
    "@xcite obtained an indication on the existence of one dibaryon with j = t=0 and two dibaryons with j = t=1 with masses smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately , all results obtained for the dibaryon masses are very model dependent and can not reproduce the experimental data .",
    "as was shown above , in the missing mass @xmath29 spectra three peaks at 966 , 986 , and 1003 mev had been observed . on the other hand",
    ", the peak at @xmath57 mev corresponds to the peak found in @xcite which was attributed to an exotic baryon state @xmath58 .",
    "such a baryon state was first suggested in @xcite .    in @xcite tatischeff _",
    "_ investigated the reaction @xmath59 .",
    "this experiment was carried out using the proton beam at the saturn synchrotron and spes3 facility @xcite .",
    "the measurements were performed at energies of @xmath60 , 1805 , and 2100 mev and at six angles , for each energy , from @xmath61 up to @xmath62 .",
    "three peaks with widths about 58 mev have been observed in the missing mass spectra of this reaction at @xmath63 , 1044 , and 1094 mev with a statistic significance between 17 and 2 standard deviations .",
    "two of these masses are below the sum of the nucleon and pion masses .",
    "if exotic baryons with anomalously small masses really exist , the peaks observed at 966 , 986 , and 1003 mev in @xcite might be a manifestation of such states .",
    "this is not in contradiction to the interpretation of the peaks in the @xmath22 mass spectra of @xcite as snds , since in principle the snds could decay into @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the snd decay width could be equal to a few mev .",
    "the existence of such exotic states , if proved to be true , will fundamentally change our understanding of the quark structure of hadrons .",
    "exotic baryon states with masses smaller than @xmath65 can mainly decay with an emission of photons .",
    "if they decay into @xmath66 then such states have to contribute to the compton scattering on the nucleon .",
    "however , lvov and workman @xcite showed that existing experimental data on this process `` completely exclude '' such exotic baryons as intermediate states in the compton scattering on the nucleon . on the other hand ,",
    "the early compton scattering data were not accurate enough to rule out these baryon resonances .",
    "moreover , a measurement of the process @xmath67 in the photon energy range @xmath68 mev resulted in a peak at @xmath69 mev with an experimental resolution of 5 mev and with 3.5 standard deviations @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the accuracy of this experiment is not enough to do an unambiguous conclusion about the @xmath58 contribution to the compton scattering on the nucleon .    in @xcite",
    "it was assumed that these states could belong to the totally antisymmetric @xmath70-plet of the spin - flavor su(6)@xmath71 symmetry .",
    "such a @xmath58 can transit into a nucleon only if two quarks from the @xmath58 participate in the interaction @xcite then the simplest decay of the exotic baryons with the small masses is @xmath72 .",
    "the production of such baryons in reactions on the nucleon is possible only through states with the mixed spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "the lowest of them are @xmath73 and @xmath74 resonances .",
    "the reaction @xmath75 was studied in @xcite to search for narrow baryon resonances . in this experiment",
    "the mass resolution of 2.0 mev was achieved .",
    "a search for structures in the mass region of @xmath76 gev yielded no signal .",
    "this experiment was performed at the invariant mass of the @xmath77 system equal to @xmath78 gev . however , if the excited baryons belong to the totally antisymmetric representation , this value of @xmath79 is far enough from the position of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 resonances and the cross section of the @xmath58 production could be small at this @xmath79 .    in @xcite",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath81 reactions were investigated at mami .",
    "the missing mass resolution was 0.6 to 1.6 mev ( fwhm ) in the proton experiment and 0.9 to 1.3 mev in the deuteron experiment .",
    "none of these measurements showed a signal for narrow resonances to a level of down to @xmath82 with respect to the neutron peak in the missing mass spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the value of @xmath79 used in this experiment does not also allow the hypothesis of @xcite to be checked .",
    "it should be noted that the reaction @xmath81 is the analog of the process @xmath83 studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in this work that the snd decay channel @xmath84 is strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore , the negative result of work @xcite at the investigation of the reaction @xmath81 only supports the result of @xcite and it is an additional argument that the snds observed in @xcite are isovectors .    on the other hand , the @xmath58s were produced in @xcite , more probably , from the decay of 6-quark states , what is supported by the observation of the dibaryon resonances in @xcite .",
    "therefore , an exotic quark structure of the @xmath58 could arise which suppressed , in particular , the decay @xmath85 and could be the reason that such states were not observed in reactions on separate nucleons up to now .    in order to clarify the question about an existence of such exotic baryons ,",
    "different experiments were proposed , in particular , in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that values of the masses of the baryon resonances , observed in this work , can be reproduced with good enough accuracy by the mass formula for two colored clusters of quarks at the end of a stretched bag which was derived in terms of color magnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "there are two free parameters in this model which were fixed by requiring the mass of the nucleon and that of the roper resonance to be reproduced exactly . as a result of the calculations , the following values of the masses and possible isospin @xmath86 and spin @xmath87 of these baryons",
    "have been obtained : @xmath88",
    "n. konno @xcite pointed out that the masses of the exotic baryons from @xcite can also be calculated with the help of the mass formula of the diquark cluster model @xcite .",
    "eight free parameters of this model were fixed using data of baryon masses and the @xmath89 phase shift .",
    "this model predicted the following values of the masses and @xmath90 : @xmath91 @xmath92    however , these two models do not reproduce the values of masses : 966 and 986 mev , obtained in @xcite .    th .",
    "walcher @xcite noted that the masses taking all experiments together and including the neutron ground state and two additional masses at 1023 and 1069 mev are equidistant within the errors with an average mass difference of @xmath93 mev .",
    "the author hypothesized the existence of a light goldstone boson with the mass of 21 mev consisting of light current quarks .",
    "it was assumed that the series of excited states is due to the nucleon in its ground state plus 1 , 2 , 3 , ... light goldstone bosons as the quantum of excitation .",
    "in this section we construct a model which allows the calculation of the masses of all possible exotic baryon states below the @xmath94 meson production threshold .",
    "this model is based on the calculation of the contribution of a meson  baryon loop to the exotic baryon mass operator with the help of dispersion relations with two subtractions .",
    "an analysis of the mass shifts of experimentally well - known baryons due to meson - baryon loops was carried out in a set of works ( see for references @xcite ) . in these works ,",
    "the self energy of a baryon was calculated , as a rule , in the framework of a perturbation theory . in this case ,",
    "an underintegral expression diverges strongly and additional assumptions about a behavior of baryon - baryon - meson vertices are required .",
    "we determine the mass operator as @xmath95 where @xmath17 is the 4-momentum of the @xmath58 under consideration , @xmath96 is the mass of the baryon in the intermediate state .",
    "then the mass of the @xmath58 is equal to @xmath97 where @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 are scalar functions .    in order to find the mass @xmath101",
    ", we construct the dispersion relations over @xmath102 for @xmath103 with two subtraction at @xmath104 . then taking into account ( [ m ] ) we obtain the following nonlinear integral equation for @xmath101 @xmath105 where @xmath4 means a principal part of the integral .",
    "all particles in the intermediate state are on their mass shells .",
    "as the subtraction is performed at the mass shell of the baryon in the intermediate state , the subtraction constant @xmath106 is equal to zero .",
    "we also assume that @xmath107 .",
    "this assumption corresponds to a supposition that the baryon with the mass @xmath96 is in the ground state .",
    "it should be noted that if one takes into account a few different baryons in the intermediate state , the subtraction constants could not be equal to zero because in this case the mass @xmath96 does not coincide with the mass shell for some of these baryons .",
    "two subtractions in the dispersion relations provide a very good convergence of the underintegral expression in ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to a consideration of one baryon and the pion only in the intermediate state . the calculations showed that the contribution of the @xmath108 meson is negligible .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the contribution of other heavy mesons in the mass region under consideration is negligible too",
    ". however , these contributions could be important in the mass region higher than the meson  baryon production threshold .",
    "equation ( [ ds ] ) can be also used for the calculation of the masses of the well - known nucleon resonances .",
    "therefore , to check an efficiency of the mass formula obtained , we will apply it to calculate the mass of @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the contribution of the pion  nucleon loop to @xmath109 can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath96 ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) are the 4-momentum and the mass of the nucleon ( pion ) in the intermediate state , @xmath17 is the 4-momentum of the @xmath0 resonance .",

    "in accordance with @xcite we use the following parametrization @xmath122 @xmath123 the coupling constant @xmath124 can be expressed through the decay width of the @xmath125 resonance @xmath126 as @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "this value of @xmath129 is equal to @xmath130 for the decay channel @xmath131 and @xmath132 for the @xmath133 channel .    substituting ( [ imd3 ] ) into ( [ ds ] ) and taking into account the indicated parametrization we obtain for the mass of the @xmath134 resonance the value of 1247 mev .",
    "it differs not strongly from the experimental value of 1232 mev .",
    "this result confirms a good efficiency of this mass formula .",
    "we will consider here only baryons with the spin equal to 1/2 .",
    "then the function @xmath135 for the baryon - pion loop can be written as @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath111 is the 4-momentum of the baryon in the intermediate state .",

    ". then equation ( [ ds ] ) has solutions in the mass region lower than the @xmath148 production threshold only if the final baryon with the mass @xmath101 and the baryon in the intermediate state have opposite parities .",
    "taking the nucleon plus the pion ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) in the intermediate state , we find for the first exotic baryon state the mass @xmath151 mev and @xmath152 . then taking the first exotic baryon with @xmath153 mev , @xmath152 and the @xmath94 meson in the intermediate state we obtain for the second exotic baryon state @xmath154 mev and @xmath155 . continuing the same procedure , six possible exotic states of baryons",
    "have been found .",

    "as the snds observed in @xcite decay into @xmath64 with the small relative momentum between @xmath162 and @xmath58 , the snd parity has to be determined by the parity of the @xmath58 .",
    "as seen from tables 1 and [ dibm ] , the snd parities found here agree with the results obtained for the @xmath58 states .    as for the calculations with @xmath163 , the results very close to the ones presented in can be obtained if @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "then the calculation of the mass of the snd due to the pion - deuteron loop has given @xmath160 with @xmath166 mev .",
    "to calculate the mass of the next snd , we take @xmath167 with @xmath6 and the @xmath149 and @xmath150 mesons in the intermediate state .",
