    "nearly all the physical processes that determine the structure and evolution of stars occur in their ( deep ) interiors .",
    "the production of nuclear energy that powers stars takes place in their cores for most of their lifetime .",
    "the effects of the physical processes that modify the simplest models of stellar evolution , such as mixing and diffusion , also predominantly take place in the inside of stars .",
    "the light that we receive from the stars is the main information that astronomers can use to study the universe .",
    "however , the light of the stars is radiated away from their surfaces , carrying no memory of its origin in the deep interior .",
    "therefore it would seem that there is no way that the analysis of starlight tells us about the physics going on in the unobservable stellar interiors .    however , there are stars that reveal more about themselves than others .",
    "_ variable stars _ are objects for which one can observe time - dependent light output , on a time scale shorter than that of evolutionary changes .",
    "there are two major groups of variable star , extrinsic and intrinsic variables .",
    "extrinsic variables do not change their light output by themselves .",
    "for example , the light changes of eclipsing binary stars are caused by two stars passing in front of each other , so that light coming from one of them is periodically blocked .",
    "the individual components of eclipsing binary stars are not necessarily variable . by analysing the temporal light variations and orbital motion of eclipsing binaries",
    ", one can determine their fundamental properties , and by assuming that their components are otherwise normal stars , determine fundamental properties of all stars , most importantly their masses . in this way , stars and stellar systems can be understood better .",
    "intrinsic variables , on the other hand , change their light output physically .",
    "supernovae , which are stellar implosions / explosions , can become brighter than their host galaxies because of the ejection of large amounts of material .",
    "even more revealing are stars that vary their sizes and/or shapes : _",
    "pulsating variables_.    the first pulsating star was discovered more than 400 years ago . in 1596 david fabricius",
    "remarked that the star @xmath0  ceti ( subsequently named `` mira '' , the wonderful ) disappeared from the visible sky .",
    "about 40 years later , it was realized that it did so every @xmath1  11 months ; the first periodic variable star was known ( although we know today that in this case , the term `` periodic '' is not correct in a strict sense ) .    in 1784",
    "john goodricke discovered the variability of @xmath2  cephei , and in 1914 enough evidence had been collected that harlow shapley was able to demonstrate that the variations of @xmath2  cephei and related stars ( also simply called `` cepheids '' ) was due to radial pulsation .",
    "also in the teens of the previous century , henrietta leavitt pointed out that the cepheids in the small magellanic clouds follow a period - luminosity relation , still one of the fundamental methods to determine distances in the visible universe - and one of the major astrophysical applications of pulsating stars .    with the ever increasing precision in photometric and radial velocity measurements , a large number of groups of pulsating star is nowadays known .",
    "figure 1 shows theoretical ( in the sense that the logarithm of the effective temperature is plotted versus the logarithm of the stellar luminosity ) hr diagrams containing the regions in which pulsating stars were known some 40 years ago and today .",
    "table 1 gives a rough overview of the classes of pulsator contained in fig .",
    ".selected classes of pulsating star [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the different types of pulsator have historically been classified on a phenomenological basis .",
    "the separation between those types has usually later turned out to have a physical reason .",
    "the individual classes are different in terms of types of excited pulsation mode ( or , less physical , pulsation period ) , mass and evolutionary state , hence temperature and luminosity .",
    "the names of these classes are assigned either after the name of a prototypical star or give some description of the type of variability and star .",
    "it must be pointed out that the present overview does by far not contain all types and subgroups of pulsating star that have been suggested .",
    "the cepheids are subdivided according to population and evolutionary state , into @xmath2  cephei , w vir , rv tau and bl her stars .",
    "jeffery ( 2008 ) proposed a number of types of evolved variable , there are the luminous blue variables , and there may be new classes of white dwarf pulsator , oscillating red and brown dwarfs , etc . furthermore ,",
    "some of the instability domains of different pulsators overlap and indeed , some objects called `` hybrid '' pulsators that show oscillations of two distinct types , have been discovered .",
    "also , the instability boundaries of some of these variables may need to be ( considerably ) extended and/or revised in the near future .",
    "for instance , there may be supergiant spb stars , and solar - like oscillations are expected in all stars having a significant surface convection zone .    whereas the classification of and distinction between the different classes of pulsating star , that are historically grown and modified designations , can in some cases",
    "be called arbitrary today , one recognizes an important fact : pulsating stars populate almost the entire hr diagram , and this means that they can be used to learn something about the physics of most stars .",
    "what can make a star oscillate ?",
    "after all , stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium : the gravitational pull on the mass elements of normal stars is balanced by gas pressure . if something would hit a star , the inwards moving regions will be heated , and the increased heat loss damps the motion . consequently , self - excited pulsations require a driving mechanism that overcomes this damping and results in a periodic oscillation .",
    "four major driving mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "@xmath3 mechanism _",
    "( rosseland & randers 1938 ) assumes a variation in the stellar nuclear reaction rate : if a nuclear burning region is compressed , the temperature rises and more energy is produced .",
    "this gives causes expansion , the pressure drops , and so does the energy generation : the motion is reversed and oscillations develop .",
    "the @xmath3 mechanism ( where @xmath3 is the usual designator for the nuclear reaction rate in formulae ) , that operates similar to a diesel engine , has been proposed for several different types of pulsating star , such as our sun and pulsating white dwarfs , but observational proof for oscillations driven by it is still lacking .    considerably more successful in explaining stellar oscillations is the _",
    "@xmath4 mechanism _",
    "( baker & kippenhahn 1962 and references therein ) . in layers where the opacity @xmath5 increases and/or the third adiabatic exponent @xmath6 decreases with increasing temperature , flux coming from inner layers can be temporally stored .",
    "such layers in the stellar interior are generally associated with regions where ( partial ) ionization of certain chemical elements occurs .",
    "the energy accumulated in this layer during compression is additionally released when the layer tries to reach its equilibrium state by expanding .",
    "therefore , the star can expand beyond its equilibrium radius .",
    "when the material recedes , energy is again stored in the stellar interior , and the whole cycle repeats : a periodic stellar oscillation evolves .",
    "this mechanism is also called the _ eddington valve _ , and it explains the variability of most of the known classes of pulsating star .",
    "the classical pulsators in the instability strip , ranging from the @xmath2  cephei stars to the rr lyrae stars and the @xmath2 scuti stars draw their pulsation power from the heii ionization zone , whereas the oscillations of the roap stars are believed to be excited in the hi and hei ionization zones , those of the mira variables in the hiionization zone , and those of the @xmath7  cephei and spb stars are triggered in the ionization zone of the iron - group elements .    a very similar mechanism , in the sense that it is also due to a region in the star behaving like a valve , is convective blocking ( or _ convective driving _ ) . in this scheme ( e.g. , brickhill 1991 ) , the base of a convection zone blocks the flux from the interior for some time , releasing the energy stored during compression in the subsequent expansion phase .",
    "the pulsations of white dwarf stars of spectral types da and db as well as @xmath8  doradus stars are thought to be excited ( at least partly ) via this mechanism , that may also be of importance in cepheids and mira stars",
    ".    finally , the pulsations of the sun and solar - like stars , that are intrinsically stable and therefore not called self - excited , are _ stochastically excited _ due to turbulence in their surface convection zones .",
    "the vigorous convective motion in the outer surface layers generates acoustic noise in a broad frequency range , which excites solar - like oscillation modes . due to the large number of convective elements on the surface , the excitation is of random nature , and the amplitudes of the oscillations are temporally highly variable .",
    "given the physical nature of these driving mechanisms , the existence of the different instability domains in the hr diagram ( cf .",
    "1 ) easily follows .",
    "a star must fulfil certain physical conditions that it can pulsate , as the driving mechanism must be located in a specific part of the star to give rise to observable oscillations .",
    "more physically speaking , in the case of self - excited pulsations the driving region must be located in a region where the thermal , and/or convective time scale closely corresponds the dynamical ( pulsational ) time scale .",
    "the consequence of the previous requirement is a constraint on the interior structure of a pulsating variable : if the instability region of some class of pulsating variable is accurately known , models of stars incorporating its excitation mechanism must be able to reproduce it . in this way",
    ", details of the input physics describing the interior structures of stars can be modified to reflect the observations .    however , this is not the only method available to study stellar structure and evolution from stellar pulsation .",
    "models also need to explain the oscillation properties of individual stars .",
    "we are fortunate to be in the presence of stars having very complex pulsation patterns , multiperiodic radial and nonradial oscillators .",
    "the research field that determines the internal constitution of stars from their pulsations is called _",
    "it is now due to make clear that the star whose interior structure is best known is the star closest to us , the sun .",
    "its surface can be resolved in two dimensions and millions of pulsation modes can be used for seismic analyses .",
    "the related research field is _ helioseismology _ , and it has been extensively reviewed elsewhere ( e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard 2002 , gizon et al .",
    "the present article will not touch upon helioseismology .",
    "the basic idea of asteroseismology ( see gough 1996 for a discussion of why  astero \" ) is analogous to the determination of the earth s inner structure using earthquakes : these generate seismic waves that travel through rock and other interior structures of our planet , which can then be sounded . today",
    ", the earth s interior has been completely mapped down to scales of a few hundred kilometres .",
    "the strongest earthquakes can even cause _ normal mode oscillations _",
    "( e.g. , see montagner & roult 2008 ) , that is , the whole planet vibrates with its natural frequencies ( also called _ eigenfrequencies _ in theoretical analyses ) .",
    "these normal modes are most valuable in determining the deep interior structure of the earth .",
    "asteroseismology does just the same : it uses the frequencies of the normal modes of pulsating stars ( that may be seen as `` starquakes '' ) as seismic waves .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of stellar models , that are dependent on their physical parameters and interior structures , are then matched to the observed ones .",
    "if a model succeeds in reproducing them , it is called a _ seismic model_.    the pulsation modes are waves in the stellar interior , just like the waves that musical instruments resonate in .",
    "popular articles often compare the frequency pattern of stellar oscillations to the sounds of musical instruments .",
    "the superposition of the normal mode frequencies in which a star oscillates can therefore be seen as its sound , although it generally does not involve frequencies the human ear is susceptible to .",
    "there is a large variety of normal modes that stars can pulsate in .",
    "the simplest are _ radial modes _ : the star periodically expands and shrinks , and its spherical symmetry is preserved . the mathematical description of the displacement due to the oscillations results in differential equations of the sturm - liouville type that yields discrete eigensolutions : the radial mode frequencies of the given model .",
    "pulsation in _",
    "nonradial modes _ causes deviations from spherical symmetry : the star changes its shape .",
    "mathematically , this no longer results in an eigenvalue problem of the sturm - liouville type , and a large number of possible oscillation modes originates .",
    "the eigenfunctions are proportional to _ spherical harmonics _ :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the angle from the polar axis ( colatitude ) , @xmath11 is the longitude , @xmath12 is the associated legendre polynomial , @xmath13 is a normalization constant and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the spherical degree and azimuthal order of the oscillation . with    @xmath16",
    "we obtain    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    etc . etc .    what does this mean in practice ?",
    "nonradial pulsation modes generate distortions on the stellar surface described by these spherical harmonics .",
    "the oscillations separate the stellar surface into expanding and receding as well as heating or cooling areas .",
    "a graphical example of these is shown in fig .  2 .    ,",
    "arranged in the same way as the previous expressions for the associated legendre polynomials . whilst the outward moving areas of the star are coloured in dark grey , the light grey areas move inward , and vice versa .",
    "the pole and equator of the star are indicated .",
    "adapted from telting & schrijvers ( 1997).,width=566 ]    between the expanding and receding surface areas , no motion takes place .",
    "the lines along which this is the case are called the _ node lines _ ; the nulls of the previously specified associated legendre polynomials specify the locations of these node lines in polar direction .",
    "the total number of node lines on the stellar surface is the _ spherical degree _",
    "@xmath14 , which must in all cases be larger than or equal to zero .",
    "the number of node lines that are intersected when travelling around the stellar equator is the _ azimuthal order _",
    "@xmath15 . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the quantities that appear in the expressions for the eigenfunctions and for the associated legendre polynomial given above , and they are used for the classification of the pulsation modes .    pulsation modes with @xmath20 are travelling waves (",
    "as can also be seen in the defining equation for spherical harmonics ) , and as they can run either with or against the rotation of the star , m can lie in the interval @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "modes with @xmath22 are called _ axisymmetric _ , modes with @xmath23 are named _ sectoral _ , and all other modes are referred to as _ tesseral _ modes .",
    "the third quantity needed to describe pulsation modes is the _ radial overtone _ @xmath24 ( sometimes also denoted @xmath25 in the literature ) , which is the number of nodes in the stellar interior .",
    "a mode that has no node in the interior is called a _ fundamental mode_. a mode with one interior node is called the _ first overtone _ , modes with two interior nodes are the _ second overtone _ , etc .",
    "an accurate account of mode classification from the theoretical point of view is given by deubner & gough ( 1984 ) .",
    "historically , observationally , and inconsistently with the theoretical definition , radial overtone modes have also been called the first and second harmonics , respectively , and have been abbreviated with f for the fundamental , as well as 1h ( or 1o ) , 2h ( or 2o ) etc . for the overtones .",
    "radial pulsations can be seen as modes with @xmath26 ( remember that @xmath27 ) ; all other modes are nonradial oscillations . modes with @xmath28 are also called _ dipole modes _ ; @xmath29 modes are _ quadrupole modes_.    there are two major restoring forces for stellar oscillations that attempt to bring the star back in its equilibrium configuration : pressure and buoyancy ( gravity ) . for radial motion ,",
    "the gravitational force in a star increases during compression , so it would actually accelerate , and not restore , the oscillation . therefore",
    ", pressure must be the restoring force .",
    "on the other hand , for a predominantly transverse motion , gravity restores the motion through buoyancy , similar to what can be observed when throwing a stone into a pond .",
    "therefore , aside from their identification with the pulsational quantum numbers @xmath30 and @xmath15 , nonradial pulsation modes are also classified into p _ pressure ( p ) modes _ and _ gravity ( g ) modes_. these two sets of modes thus differ by the main direction of their motion ( radial / transverse ) , and their frequencies .",
    "pulsation modes with periods longer than that of the radial fundamental mode are usually g modes , whereas p modes have periods equal or shorter than that ; radial pulsations are always p modes .",
    "the different modes are often labelled with their radial overtone number , e.g.  a p@xmath31 mode is a pressure mode with three radial nodes , and a g@xmath32 mode is a gravity mode with eight radial nodes .",
    "modes with no interior nodes are fundamental modes , or f modes . note that the f mode for @xmath28 does not exist , as a dipole motion of the entire star would require a movement of the stellar centre of mass , which is physically impossible .",
    "the propagation of pulsation modes in the stellar interior is governed by two frequencies .",
    "one of these is the _ lamb frequency _ @xmath33 , which is the inverse of the time needed to travel one horizontal wavelength at local sound speed .",
    "the other frequency describes at what rate a bubble of gas oscillates vertically around its equilibrium position at any given position inside a star ; it is called the _ brunt - vaisl _ frequency @xmath34 .",
    "these two quantities are defined as :    @xmath35    where @xmath14 is the spherical degree , @xmath36 is the local velocity of sound , @xmath37 is the radius , @xmath38 is the local gravitational acceleration , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are local pressure and density in the unperturbed state , respectively , and @xmath41 is the first adiabatic exponent .",
    "the lamb and brunt - vaisl frequencies have the following implications : an oscillation with a frequency higher than both experiences pressure as the main restoring force in the corresponding part of the star .",
    "on the other hand , a vibration with a frequency lower than both @xmath33 and @xmath34 is restored mostly by buoyancy .",
    "in other words , if we have a stellar oscillation with an angular frequency @xmath42 , it is a p mode wherever @xmath43 , and it is a g mode wherever @xmath44 . in stellar interior regions where @xmath42 lies between the lamb and brunt - vaisl frequencies , the amplitude of the wave decreases exponentially with distance from the p and g mode propagation regions ; such parts in the stellar interior are called evanescent regions .",
    "a _ propagation diagram _ aids the visualization of this discussion ( fig .  3 ) .     stellar model .",
    "the run of the lamb ( dashed line ) and brunt - vaisl ( full line ) frequencies with respect to fractional stellar radius is shown .",
    "some stellar pulsation modes are indicated with thin horizontal dashed lines , the circles are interior nodes . the lowest frequency oscillation ( lowest dashed line ) shown is a @xmath45 mode ; that with the highest frequency is a @xmath46 mode .",
    "the oscillation with intermediate frequency is a mixed mode .",
    "data kindly supplied by patrick lenz.,width=434 ]    whereas the lamb frequency decreases monotonically towards the model s surface , the brunt - vaisl frequency shows a sharp peak near the model s centre and then rapidly drops to zero .",
    "this is because this model possesses a convective core , where @xmath47 , and the spike in @xmath34 is due to a region of chemical inhomogeneity . over a range of stellar models ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath33 in the interior is usually simple , whereas @xmath34 may show considerable changes with evolutionary state and mass .",
    "however , @xmath34 is always zero in the stellar centre .    in fig .  3 ,",
    "the g mode is confined to the innermost parts of the star .",
    "it is trapped in the interior , and therefore unlikely to be observed on the surface .",
    "the p mode is concentrated near the stellar surface and may be observable .",
    "the intermediate frequency mode shows remarkable behaviour : it has three nodes in the outer regions of the star , but also one node in the g mode propagation region .",
    "this particular mode is capable of tunnelling through its narrow evanescent region ; it is a g mode in the deep interior , but a p mode closer to the surface . such modes are called _",
    "mixed modes_.    as mentioned before , stellar pulsation modes can be excited in certain parts of the stellar interior and they can propagate in some regions , whereas in other regions they are damped .",
    "work integral _ is the energy gained by the pulsation mode averaged over one oscillation period .",
    "an evaluation of the work integral from the stellar centre to the surface is used to determine whether or not a given mode is globally excited in a stellar model . for excitation to occur ,",
    "the exciting forces must overcome those of damping and the work integral @xmath48 will be positive .    the _ growth rate _",
    "@xmath49 , where @xmath42 is the pulsation frequency and @xmath50 is the mode inertia , parametrizes the increase of oscillation energy during a pulsation cycle , and also indicates how rapidly the amplitude of a given mode increases . the normalized growth rate ( or stability parameter ) @xmath51 , which is the ratio of the radius - integrated work available for excitation to the radius - integrated total work ,",
    "is used to evaluate which pulsation modes are excited in the given model . if @xmath52 , a mode is driven and may reach observable amplitude ; if @xmath53 , a mode is driven in the entire stellar model , and if @xmath54 , a mode is damped everywhere in the model .",
    "the most widely used application of this stability parameter is the comparison of the excited modal frequency ranges as determined from observations and those predicted by theory .",
    "figure 4 shows how the frequency domains predicted to be excited change with the evolution of a 1.8@xmath55 main sequence model . on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , only pure p modes of high radial overtone , and corresponding high frequencies , are excited in the model .",
    "later on , some of these become stable again , but modes with lower overtone become excited . at the end of main sequence evolution , a large range of p modes , mixed modes and g modes",
    "is predicted to be excited , and the frequency spectrum becomes dense ( and even denser as the model leaves the main sequence ) .",
    "the range of excited frequencies is an observable that , when compared with models , can give an estimate of the evolutionary state of the star .",
    "oscillation spectra of a 1.8@xmath55 main sequence model , evolving from hotter to cooler effective temperature .",
    "pulsation modes excited in this model are shown with filled circles , stable modes with open circles .",
    "the types of mode on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) are given .",
    "note the g modes intruding into the p mode domain.,width=529 ]    the reason for the evolutionary change in the pulsation frequencies is that as the model evolves , its convective core , in which the g modes are trapped at the zams , shrinks and the g mode frequencies increase . at the same time the envelope expands due to the increased energy generation in the contracting nuclear burning core , causing a decrease of the p mode frequencies .    at some point ,",
    "some p and g modes attain the same frequencies , and the modes begin to interact : they become mixed modes , with g mode character in the core and p mode character in the envelope ( see also fig .  3 ) .",
    "the frequencies of these modes never reach exactly the same value ; the modes just exchange physical properties .",
    "this effect is called _ avoided crossing _ or mode bumping ( aizenman , smeyers & weigert 1977 ) .    of the individual modes ,",
    "particular astrophysical potential is carried by the mode that originates as @xmath56 on the zams , as pointed out by dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 1991 ) .",
    "this mode is mostly trapped in the shrinking convective core ( for stars sufficiently massive to possess a convective core ) , because the rapid change in mean molecular weight at its edge causes a spike in the brunt - vaisl frequency ( cf .",
    "the frequency of this mode is thus dependent on the size of the convective core .",
    "the most important parameter determining the evolution of main sequence stars is the amount of nuclear fuel available .",
    "stellar core convection can mix material from the radiative layer on top of the core into it , providing more nuclear fuel .",
    "this mixing is often named _ convective core overshooting _ and parametrized in theoretical models .",
    "overshooting also decreases the gradient in the mean molecular weight at the edge of the core , which means that the frequency of the mode that is @xmath56 on the zams measures the convective core size , a most important quantity for astrophysics in general . to emphasize its sensitivity to the extent of stellar core convection",
    ", this mode has also been named @xmath57 mode .    in the following , only p and g modes , and mixed modes of these types",
    "will be considered .",
    "other types of mode , such as r modes ( torsional oscillations that may occur in rotating stars ) , g@xmath58 modes ( convectively excited g modes in rotating stars ) , strange modes ( showing up in calculations of highly nonadiabatic environments ) or gravitational - wave w modes , will not be discussed as they have been of little practical importance for the seismic sounding of stars at the time of this writing .",
    "the frequencies of the p and g modes of pulsating stars depend strongly on their structure .",
    "however , when high radial overtones are considered , some simple relations between mode frequencies emerge .",
    "these are derived from _",
    "asymptotic theory_. the classical reference on the subject is tassoul ( 1980 ) , the instructive is gough ( 1986 ) . in the high - overtone limit",
    "one finds    @xmath59    for p modes , whereas for g modes    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the inverse sound travel time through the centre of the star , @xmath62 is a frequency separation dependent on the stellar evolutionary state , @xmath63 is the asymptotic period that is proportional to the integral of the brunt - vaisl frequency throughout the star , @xmath14 and @xmath25 are the spherical degree and radial overtone , respectively , and @xmath3 and @xmath2 are stellar structure parameters , respectively .",
    "these relations have important consequences : low - degree p modes of consecutive high radial overtones of the same spherical degree are equally spaced in frequency , whereas low - degree g modes of consecutive high radial overtones of the same spherical degree are equally spaced in period .",
    "furthermore , if the parameter @xmath62 were zero , eq .",
    "7 indicates that the frequencies of high - overtone p modes of even and odd degrees would be the same , respectively , and odd - degree modes would have frequencies intermediate between those of even degree . in realistic stellar models , these relations hold approximately , but not exactly .    in a nonrotating star ,",
    "the frequencies of modes with @xmath64 are the same as those of the @xmath22 modes .",
    "however , as the @xmath64 modes are travelling waves , their frequencies separate in the observer s frame when looking at a rotating star : the mode moving with rotation appears at higher frequency , the mode moving against rotation appears at lower frequency and the frequency difference to their nonrotating value is m times the rotation frequency ( e.g. , see cox 1984 ) .",
    "this effect is called _ rotational frequency splitting _ , and is one basic tool of asteroseismology : if such splittings are observed , the rotation frequency of the star can be determined .    unfortunately , reality is not quite as simple as that .",
    "the coriolis force acts on the travelling waves and modifies their frequencies .",
    "in addition , the @xmath64 modes cause tidal bulges , on which centrifugal forces act .",
    "therefore , the frequencies of these modes are often expressed as    @xmath65    in case of ( moderately ) slow stellar rotation ( dziembowski & goode 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath66 is the observed frequency of the mode @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the stellar rotation frequency , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants that describe the effects of the coriolis and centrifugal forces , respectively ; they are also called ledoux constants .",
    "these constants are usually determined from stellar model calculations .",
    "the rotational splitting constant @xmath69 also approaches asymptotic values for high radial overtones . for g modes",
    ", @xmath69 becomes @xmath71 , and for p modes @xmath72 in the asymptotic limit .",
    "it should be made clear that the previous formula is only an approximation for the case that rotation can be treated as a perturbation to the equilibrium state : stellar rotation distorts the spherical shape of a star . as a consequence , the individual modes can no longer be described with single spherical harmonics .",
    "for instance , radial modes receive contamination of @xmath29 and other modes with even @xmath14 .",
    "vice versa , @xmath29 modes obtain some @xmath73 , @xmath74 , etc .   contributions . in the previous formula",
    "this means that for rapid rotation higher order terms may be added , but to arrive at reliable results , two - dimensional numerical calculations are really required .",
    "_ rotational mode coupling _ can affect the properties of oscillation modes with close frequencies ( e.g. , see ( daszynska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "furthermore , the rotational distortion causes the stellar temperature to increase at the flattened poles and to decrease at the equatorial bulge .",
    "it follows that asteroseismology of rapidly rotating stars has an additional degree of complexity .",
    "even more complexity to the theoretical treatment of stellar pulsation is added by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "a weak magnetic field would generate a second - order perturbation to the pulsation frequencies , just like the centrifugal force in case of rotation , but with opposite sign , i.e.  the observed oscillation frequencies would increase with respect to the non - magnetic case ( e.g. , jones et al .",
    "1989 ) .    in the presence of a strong magnetic field",
    ", the effect would be more severe : if the field was oblique to the rotation axis ( just like the earth s magnetic field ! ) , the pulsation axis would align with the magnetic axis , and no longer with the rotation axis , as implicitly assumed so far .",
    "this means that an observer would see each pulsation mode at a varying angle over the stellar rotation period , creating amplitude and phase variations with exactly that period , and therefore separable from the effects of rotational m - mode splitting .",
    "a star oscillating in this way is called _ oblique pulsator _ ( kurtz 1982 ) .",
    "we note for completeness that the most general case of rotational splitting is the _ nonaligned pulsator _ ( pesnell 1985 ) , where @xmath75 components of a given mode appear , with frequency separations proportional to the rotation period and to the angle between the rotation and pulsation axes .    to summarize , different stellar pulsation modes propagate in different interior regions , and their energy within those regions is not equally distributed .",
    "each single pulsation mode has a different cavity , and its oscillation frequency is determined by the physical conditions in its cavity .",
    "this means that different modes are sensitive to the physical conditions in different parts of the stellar interior .",
    "some modes teach us more about stellar envelopes , whereas other modes tell us about the deep interior .",
    "the more modes of different type are detected in a given star , the more complete our knowledge about its inner structure can become .    some stars do us the favour to oscillate in many of these radial and/or nonradial modes simultaneously .",
    "interior structure models of the stars can then be refined by measuring the oscillation frequencies of these stars , identifying them with their pulsational quantum numbers , and by reproducing all these with stellar models .",
    "this method is very sensitive because stellar oscillation frequencies can be measured to extremely high precision , up to one part in 10@xmath76 ( kepler et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the following",
    "it will be described what observables are available to base asteroseismic models on , how the measurements can be interpreted , and how observations and theory are used to develop methods for asteroseismic interpretations .",
    "because stellar oscillations generate motions and temperature variations on the surface , they result in observable variability .",
    "the interplay of these variations causes light , radial velocity and line profile changes .",
    "pulsating stars can thus be studied both photometrically and spectroscopically , via time series measurements .",
    "these time series are subjected to _",
    "frequency analysis _ , meaning that the constituent signals are extracted from the data . in many cases ,",
    "this is done by harmonic analysis , transforming the time series into frequency / amplitude space , e.g. by using the discrete fourier transformation    @xmath77    of the input function @xmath78 , corresponding to the time series of the measurements .",
    "periodograms , amplitude or power spectra are means of visualizing the results ; an example is given in fig .",
    "the amplitude spectrum in fig .  5 can be used to estimate the frequencies of the dominant signals in the time series . in many cases ,",
    "the analysis is carried forward by fitting sinusoids to the data , determining and optimizing their frequencies , amplitudes and phases , often by least squares methods .",
    "it has also become common practice to subtract this optimized fit from the data and to compute periodograms of the residuals , a procedure called _",
    "prewhitening_. this process is repeated until no more significant signals can be found in the data ( a most delicate decision ! ) .",
    "depending on the specific case and requirements of the data set , a large number of alternative frequency analysis methods can also be applied , such as phase - dispersion minimization , autocorrelation methods , wavelet analysis etc .",
    "care must be taken to keep the limitations of the data sets and of the applied methods in mind .",
    "periods no longer than the data set itself can be reliably determined , and adjacent frequencies spaced no more than the inverse length of the data set can be resolved .",
    "nonsinusoidal signals cause harmonics and combination frequencies in fourier amplitude spectra that must not be mistaken for independent mode frequencies . no frequencies shorter than the inverse of twice the median distance between consecutive",
    "data points can be unambiguously detected ; the highest frequency that can be retrieved in a given set of measurements is also called its _",
    "nyquist frequency_.    having determined the frequencies characterizing the stellar variability , the next step is their interpretation",
    ". measurements of distant stars have an important limitation : nonradial oscillations create patterns of brighter and fainter , approaching and receding areas on the stellar surface .",
    "however , as a distant observer can usually not resolve the stellar surface , she or he can only measure the joint effect of the pulsations in light and radial velocity . as a consequence , the effects of oscillations with high spherical degree average out in disk - integrated measurements , and",
    "their observed amplitudes are reduced with respect to the intrinsic value .",
    "this effect is called _ geometric cancellation _ ( dziembowski 1977 ) .",
    "calculations show that the amplitude drops as @xmath79 for high @xmath14 . in ground based observational studies",
    "it is mostly assumed ( and confirmed ) that only modes with @xmath80 are observed in light and radial velocity , with a few exceptions of @xmath14 up to 4 .",
    "radial velocity measurements are somewhat more sensitive to higher @xmath14 than photometric observations .",
    "once the oscillation frequencies of a given star have been determined , how can they be made asteroseismic use of ? as an example , high - precision radial velocity measurements of the close - by star @xmath81 centauri a showed the presence of solar - like oscillations ; the power spectrum ( square of amplitude vs.  frequency ) of these data is shown in fig .",
    "centauri a ( bedding et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the vertical dotted lines are separated by 106.2@xmath82hz.,width=585 ]    this graph contains a series of maxima equally spaced in frequency : a high - overtone p mode spectrum , as predicted by asymptotic theory .",
    "the mean frequency spacing is 106.2@xmath82hz .",
    "however , it is obvious that only every other of the strongest peaks conforms to this spacing ; there are other signals in between . the signals halfway between the vertical lines in fig .",
    "6 , denoting modes of spherical degree @xmath14 , are a consequence of eq",
    ".  7 : these are modes with @xmath83 . given the effects of geometrical cancellation , it is straightforward to assume that these are the modes of lowest @xmath14 , viz .",
    "@xmath73 and 1 .    however , there is more information present",
    ". a close look at fig .",
    "6 reveals that many of the strongest peaks seem to be split .",
    "again , the explanation for this finding lies within eq .  7 : the close neighbours are modes with @xmath84 .",
    "these frequencies no longer have the same values as those with degree @xmath14 because the stellar interior has structure .",
    "as stars evolve on the main sequence , their nuclear burning cores shrink , increase in density , and change in chemical composition as evolution progresses .",
    "this alters the acoustic sound speed in the core and is reflected in the frequency differences between modes of degrees @xmath85 , also called the _ small frequency separation @xmath86_. on the other hand , evolution causes expansion of the outer regions of stars that become more tenuous , which increases the sound travel time through the star .",
    "this is measurable via the frequency difference between consecutive radial overtones and is called the _ large frequency separation @xmath87_.    the large and the small separations can be computed for a range of theoretical stellar models .",
    "it turns out that a plot of @xmath88 vs.  @xmath87 allows an unambiguous determination of stellar mass and evolutionary state , and this method works particularly well for models with parameters similar to our sun ( main sequence , @xmath89 ) .",
    "this diagnostic is called an _ asteroseismic hr diagram _ ( christensen - dalsgaard 1988 ) .",
    "another important tool to analyse high - overtone p mode pulsation spectra is the _",
    "echelle diagram_. this diagram plots the oscillation frequencies versus their modulus with respect to the large separation .",
    "figure 7 shows the echelle diagram for @xmath81  cen  a constructed from the frequencies of the signals apparent in fig .",
    "modes.,width=491 ]    the frequencies fall onto four distinct ridges , corresponding to modes of the same spherical degree @xmath14 . in this way , @xmath14 can be identified . from left to right , the ridges correspond to @xmath90 and 1 , respectively , and it can be seen that , within the errors , @xmath91 , consistent with eq .",
    "the scatter in this diagram is due to a combination of the temporal resolution of the data and , more importantly , the finite lifetimes of the stochastically excited modes .",
    "the example of @xmath81  cen  a shows that once a sufficient number of intrinsic pulsation frequencies of a given star has been determined , one may identify their spherical degrees by _",
    "pattern recognition_. this method is also applicable to the oscillation spectra of pulsating white dwarf stars , as exemplified in fig .",
    "the series of peaks discernible in fig .",
    "8 does not form a pattern of equally spaced frequencies , but of equally spaced periods .",
    "this is the signature of a high overtone g mode pulsation spectrum ( eq .",
    "8) . in this case ,",
    "all the strong peaks are roughly aligned with the vertical lines ; there are no strong modes in between .",
    "some of the expected signals are missing , but in most cases only apparently : they are just much weaker in amplitude .",
    "a mean period spacing of 39.5 seconds has been determined from this analysis , and the obvious identification of the strongest modes is @xmath28 .",
    "equation 8 then results in @xmath92s . for pulsating white dwarf stars",
    ", @xmath63 is a measure of the stellar mass , which was consequently determined .    furthermore , several of the strongest peaks in fig .",
    "8 are split into triplets .",
    "these triplets are equally spaced in frequency , and they are the signature of rotationally split m modes ( eq .",
    "the rotation period of gd 358 could therefore also be determined , just from an inspection of the power spectrum of its photometric time series , and basic application of theory .",
    "the fact that the @xmath15-mode splitting only results in triplets strengthens the previous identification of the spherical degree as @xmath28 .",
    "the relative amplitudes within those triplets are dependent on the inclination of the stellar pulsation axis ( eq .  4 ) , which may then be determined , but in reality there are other , presently unknown , effects that modify the relative multiplet amplitudes .",
    "there is even more information present .",
    "it is noticeable that the peaks in the amplitude spectrum do not perfectly conform to their asymptotically predicted locations .",
    "this is a sign of _ mode trapping_. white dwarf stars consist of a degenerate core , with subsequent outer layers of different chemical elements .",
    "the transition regions between these layers create spikes in the brunt - vaisl frequency .",
    "the pulsation modes prefer to place their radial nodes in these transition regions , and be standing waves to both sides of the nodes .",
    "this modifies their frequencies compared to the case of homogeneous interior structure and gives rise to the observed deviations from equal period spacing .",
    "the observant reader will have noticed three apparent inconsistencies in the previous paragraphs .",
    "how can two stars with similar oscillation frequencies be high - overtone p and g mode pulsators , respectively ?",
    "how does one know that 106.2@xmath82hz is the mean frequency spacing for @xmath81  cen  a , and not half this value ? why can the claimed small frequency separation not be the effect of rotation ?",
    "this is because some additional constraints are available that help in the interpretation of pulsational mode spectra .",
    "as the p mode pulsation periods depend on the sound travel time through the star , they must be related to its size , or more precisely , to its mean density .",
    "the _ pulsation constant _    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the pulsation period and @xmath95 is the mean stellar density , is a useful indicator of what type of mode one sees in a given star . over the whole hr diagram ,",
    "the q value for the radial fundamental mode is between @xmath96d ; for the sun , it is 0.033d ( 0.8hr ) . as mentioned before",
    ", radial modes can only be p modes , ( pure ) p modes always have frequencies of the same order or larger than that of the radial fundamental , and ( pure ) g modes always have frequencies lower than that .    because gd 358 is a white dwarf star and therefore has high mean density , its radial fundamental mode period would be of the order of 4s .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath81  cen  a , a little more massive and more evolved than our sun , has a radial fundamental mode period of about 1hr .",
    "therefore , the similar 5 - 10 minute pulsation periods of the two stars correspond to completely different types of mode .",
    "the asymptotic p mode frequency separation also relates to the stellar mean density    @xmath97    where @xmath98hz .",
    "given the knowledge on the mass and evolutionary state of @xmath81  cen  a , it immediately be inferred that 106.2@xmath82hz must be the large frequency spacing .",
    "finally , the rotation period of @xmath81  cen  a is much too long to generate @xmath15-mode splitting with the observed @xmath86 .",
    "apart from these examples , there is another clue towards the nature of observed pulsation modes just from observed frequency spectra .",
    "radial modes are global oscillations that may reveal themselves because the period ratios of consecutive overtones are well known . on the main sequence , the period ratio of the radial fundamental mode and the first overtone is around 0.773 , and the period ratio of the first to second overtone radial modes is 0.810 . for more evolved stars , such as the @xmath2  cephei stars , these ratios change to 0.705 and 0.805 , respectively .",
    "such period ratios are therefore suggestive to correspond to radial modes .",
    "it is now clear that besides the pulsational mode spectra of stars themselves , the incorporation of other constraints is useful for their interpretation .",
    "this is particularly important for oscillation spectra that do not show obvious imprints of the underlying modes , like those of stars pulsating in high radial overtones .",
    "examples are pulsations of low radial overtone or stars rotating so rapidly that the rotational splitting is of the same order as the frequency spacing of consecutive radial overtones of the same @xmath14 or of modes of the same @xmath24 , but different @xmath14 . in practice ,",
    "most observed stellar oscillation spectra are incomplete , either because the star chooses so or because the observations do not have sufficient sensitivity , which makes it even more difficult to recognize patterns in the observed frequencies or periods and to type the modes accordingly .",
    "therefore , _",
    "mode identification methods _ have been developed , of which a variety is available .",
    "the first method uses photometric data only .",
    "the flux change for nonradial pulsation in the linear regime can be expressed as    @xmath99    ( watson 1988 ) , where @xmath100 is the time and wavelength dependent magnitude variation of an oscillation , @xmath101 is an amplitude parameter transformed from fluxes to magnitudes , @xmath12 is the associated legendre polynomial , @xmath102 is the cosine of the inclination of the stellar pulsation axis with respect to the observer , @xmath42 is the angular pulsation frequency , @xmath103 is time and @xmath104 is the phase lag between the changes in temperature and local geometry ( mostly originating in convection zones near the stellar surface ) .",
    "the term @xmath105 is the local temperature change on the surface , @xmath106 is the temperature - dependent limb darkening variation , @xmath107 is the local geometry change on the stellar surface , @xmath108 is the local surface pressure change and @xmath109 is the gravity - dependent limb darkening variation .",
    "the @xmath110 terms can be determined for different types of pulsator from theoretical model atmospheres , and the observables best suited to reveal the types of mode present can also be deduced .",
    "these would for instance be the photometric amplitude ratios or phase shifts between different filter passbands , but also the optimal passbands themselves .",
    "an example of such a mode identification is shown in fig .",
    "cephei star 12  lacertae from multicolour photometry ( taken from handler et al .",
    "the amplitudes are normalized to unity in the ultraviolet and compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "the full lines are for @xmath73 , the dashed lines for @xmath28 , the dashed - dotted lines for @xmath29 , the dotted lines for @xmath111 , and the dashed - triple dotted lines for @xmath74 .",
    "the modes investigated in the two left panels are @xmath28 , the next is @xmath29 and the rightmost one is @xmath73.,width=604 ]    from photometry alone , only the spherical degree of a given pulsation mode can be identified .",
    "the method can be supported by adding radial velocity measurements , which increases its sensitivity ( daszynska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski , & pamyatnykh 2005 ) , but still does not supply a determination of the azimuthal order . to this end , high resolution spectroscopy must be invoked .",
    "the lines in a stellar spectrum are broadened by rotation through the doppler effect : the intrinsic line profile is blueshifted on the parts of the stellar surface approaching the observer , and redshifted on the areas moving away .",
    "the effect is strongest on the stellar limb and decreases towards the centre . as a consequence ,",
    "a rotationally broadened line profile contains spatial information of the stellar surface .",
    "for instance , in a dark starspot flux is missing , and a spike will move through the line profile as the spot rotates over the visible disk .",
    "the method to reconstruct stellar surface structure from line profile variations is called _ doppler imaging _ ( vogt & penrod 1983 ) .",
    "apart from radial velocity changes , stellar oscillations also cause variations in rotationally broadened line profiles .",
    "the areas on the stellar surface that have an additional approaching component to their motion with respect to the observer have their contribution to the line profile blueshifted , whereas the receding parts are redshifted by the corresponding amount of pulsational doppler velocity .",
    "the net result of all these motions is bumps travelling through the line profile , and their shapes are governed by the oscillation mode causing them ( e.g. , see telting 2003 for a review ) .",
    "examining stellar line profiles , pulsation modes of up to @xmath112 can be observed and identified , a vast extension in @xmath14 compared to photometric and radial velocity techniques .",
    "some examples of pulsational line profile variations are shown in fig .",
    "10 .    ) generates a different distortion of the line profile .",
    "adapted from telting & schrijvers ( 1997).,width=585 ]    the task now is to extract the correct values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the observed variations .",
    "the principle is to fit the theoretically calculated 3-d velocity field to the observed line profiles , and a wide range of spectroscopic mode identification methods is available .",
    "some of the most commonly used are the moment method ( most suitable for low @xmath14 ) , the pixel - by - pixel method , the fourier parameter fit method , or doppler reconstruction of the surface distortions .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy is better suited for the determination of @xmath15 rather than @xmath14 which makes it complementary to photometric and radial velocity methods .    when resorting to photometric or spectroscopic methods , it is not required to arrive at unique identifications of",
    "all observed pulsation modes in each given star .",
    "what is needed is the secure identification of a sufficient number of modes to rule out all possible alternative interpretations .",
    "an example will be presented later .      the observed pulsation frequencies and their identifications are then matched to theoretical models ( see kawaler , this volume , for details )",
    ". these would ideally be full evolutionary models with pulsation codes operating on them , although a few codes based on envelope models are still in use .",
    "most pulsation codes use the _ linear approximation _ : the oscillations are treated as linear perturbations around the equilibrium state .",
    "this allows the evaluation of the excitation of oscillation modes and thus the computation of theoretical domains of pulsation in the hr diagram .",
    "nonlinear computations , that would allow predictions of oscillation amplitudes , are still rather the exception than the rule because they are , even today , expensive in terms of computing time , as are numerical hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "many stellar pulsation codes employ the _",
    "adiabatic approximation _",
    "( sometimes called isentropic approximation ) to compute oscillation frequencies , which is the assumption that no energy exchange between the oscillating element and its surroundings takes place .",
    "other codes perform nonadiabatic frequency computations .",
    "a wide variety of stellar oscillation codes is available , and most theory groups use their own routines , optimized for the application to their objects of main interest .",
    "there are several strategies to find seismic models from observations .",
    "some compare the observed oscillation frequencies with those of a grid of stellar models and perform automatic matching between them .",
    "this is computationally extensive , which means that supercomputers or parallel processing are invoked , or that intelligent optimization methods such as genetic algorithms are employed , or both .",
    "other strategies start with first imposing observational constraints . besides the observed oscillation frequencies themselves and the identification of the underlying pulsation modes",
    ", these would often be estimates of the objects positions in the hr diagram .",
    "as an example , these are shown for the @xmath7  cephei star @xmath113  eridani in fig .",
    "the numbers on top of each mode ( group ) are their @xmath14 identifications , consistent in photometry and spectroscopy ( de ridder et al .",
    "right : a plot of the star s position in the theoretical hr diagram ( star symbol ) with its error bars and lines of equal mean density for the observed radial mode periods assuming they the fundamental , first and second overtones , respectively ( thick lines ) .",
    "some model evolutionary tracks labelled with their masses , the zero - age main sequence , and the borders of the @xmath7  cephei ( dashed - dotted line ) and spb star ( dashed lines ) instability strips are also shown.,width=585 ]    the detection of a radial mode in the frequency spectrum is an asset for asteroseismic studies of this star : there are only three possibilities for the value of its mean density .",
    "these depend on whether its frequency corresponds to the fundamental , the first or the second radial overtone ( eq .  11 ) .",
    "a comparison of the observed position of the star in the hr diagram ( right panel of fig .  11 ) with its error bars leads to the rejection of the second overtone hypothesis , and to the elimination of models with masses below 8.5m@xmath114 .    now",
    "the @xmath28 modes come into play : moving along the lines of constant mean density in the hr diagram , a comparison between their observed and theoretically predicted frequencies can be made .",
    "this is done on the left side in fig .",
    "12 . given the uncertainties and assumptions in the asteroseismic model construction , all @xmath28 modes are reproduced by models between @xmath115m@xmath114 that have the radial mode as the fundamental .",
    "however , the frequency of the highest - overtone dipole mode can not be explained within the errors for models that assume the first overtone for the radial mode .",
    "this interpretation can therefore also be rejected .",
    "the modal assignment to the observed frequencies is now unambiguous , and the range of models to be explored for seismic fitting is severely reduced .",
    "the reason why this way of mode identification was successful is that the @xmath56 mode and its respective p mode neighbour are in the process of avoided crossing in the parameter space of interest .",
    "small changes in the evolutionary states of the models depending on mass therefore lead to significant changes in their frequencies .",
    "the observed @xmath29 mode has been excluded from the mode identification procedure as all models in the parameter domain under consideration reproduce its frequency correctly : it is nearly a pure p mode and its frequency hardly changes in models of the same mean density .",

    "lower panel : the same , but assuming the radial mode is the first overtone . here",
    "it would be the first g mode and the second p mode that give an acceptable fit between @xmath116m@xmath114 .",
    "however , the observed @xmath28 mode with highest frequency is not compatible with the more massive models .",
    "right : a comparison of the rotational splittings of a rigidly rotating model , with a rotation rate chosen to fit the observed @xmath117 triplet , with the observations . the observed splitting of the @xmath118 triplet",
    "is not reproduced with this assumption , demonstrating the presence of differential interior rotation.,width=585 ]    in this restricted parameter space , an interesting observation can be made : the observed @xmath28 m - mode splittings do not agree with those predicted by uniformly rotating models ( fig .",
    "12 , right - hand side ) . fitting the rotational splitting for the @xmath56 mode , that samples the deep stellar interior , results in predicted splitting about 30% larger than that observed for the @xmath119 mode , which is concentrated closer to the surface .",
    "this means that the star s rotation rate increases towards its interior , as predicted by theory ( talon et al .",
    "in addition , as the @xmath117 mode frequency is sensitive to the size of the convective core ( it is the @xmath57 mode ! ) , a constraint on the convective core overshooting parameter was also obtained ( pamyatnykh , handler , & dziembowski 2004 )    this example shows the potential of asteroseismology , even if only few pulsation modes are available .",
    "radial pulsations are most valuable in the identification process as they immediately provide accurate constraints on the stellar mean density that can become unambiguous if the radial overtone of the mode can be inferred , supported by other estimates such as on effective temperature and luminosity .",
    "theory and observations work hand in hand .",
    "once a unique identification of the normal modes is achieved , firm results on stellar structure can be obtained , even given uncertainties in the modelling procedure .    in the case of @xmath113  eridani , the most severe problem is that the @xmath120 mode is hard to be excited and accurately matched in frequency given the observed effective temperature of the star and its chemical surface composition . only changes to the input physics would solve this problem .",
    "this is just the goal of asteroseismology : to improve our knowledge about stellar physics .",
    "such an improvement can only be achieved using observational results that present models can not account for !",
    "the first pulsators that could be studied asteroseismically were white dwarf and pre - white dwarf stars , pulsating in high - overtone low - degree g modes .",
    "a remarkable initial result was the theoretical prediction of a then new class of pulsating white dwarfs of spectral type db , and their subsequent observational confirmation ( winget et al .",
    "1982 ) . upon the realization that some pulsating white dwarf stars have very complicated frequency spectra , and",
    "having a well - developed theory of white dwarf pulsation available , the main obstacle to extracting correct mode frequencies from observational data was the daily interruptions of the measurements by sunlight .",
    "figure 13 explains why .",
    "the interruptions cause ambiguities in the determination of the frequencies of the signals present in the data : a frequency different by one cycle per sidereal day from the real oscillation frequency would generate a fit of comparable quality . in the presence of complicated variability and most notably for signals of low signal - to - noise",
    "this could lead to erroneous frequency determinations .",
    "any seismic model based on incorrect observational input is misleading .",
    "the solution to this problem is to avoid , or at least minimize , daytime gaps in time resolved measurements .",
    "this can be accomplished by concerted observational efforts , involving interested colleagues over the whole globe , passing on the asteroseismic target from one observatory to the next .",
    "the best known of these collaborations is the whole earth telescope ( wet , nather et al .",
    "1990 ) , invented for the study of pulsating white dwarf stars .",
    "one of the first wet runs was devoted to the prototypical pulsating pre - white dwarf star pg  1159 - 035 = gw  vir .",
    "it resulted in the detection of over 100 g - mode frequencies of @xmath28 and 2 modes of high radial overtone , leading to precise determinations of the stellar mass and rotation period , an asteroseismic detection of compositional stratification , and an upper limit to the magnetic field strength ( winget et al .",
    "subsequent wet observations of the prototypical pulsating db white dwarf star gd  358 = v777  her showed a mode spectrum dominated by high - overtone @xmath28 g  modes ( cf .",
    "8) , resulting in determinations of its total and surface helium layer mass , luminosity and rotation rate ( winget et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the evolution of white dwarf stars is dominated by cooling , at ( nearly ) constant radius . as they cool , they pass through a number of instability strips .",
    "evidence is that all white dwarf stars located in such instability domains in the hr diagram do pulsate .",
    "this has an important consequence : the interior structures of the pulsators must be representative of all white dwarf stars .",
    "thus asteroseismic results for white dwarf pulsators can be extended to the stars that do not oscillate .",
    "cooling of pulsating white dwarf stars changes their oscillation periods , and the rate of period change is directly related to their energy loss .",
    "the hottest db pulsators have reasonably high neutrino emission rates , and their evolutionary period changes may be able to tell us whether their neutrino emission is compatible with the standard model of particle physics ( winget et al .",
    "2004 ) . measurements to detect such a period change are ongoing . on the other hand , the period changes of da pulsators ( some of which are the most stable optical clocks in the universe , kepler et al .",
    "2005 ) could reveal the masses of axions , if the latter existed ( kim , montgomery , & winget 2006 ) .",
    "asteroseismology of white dwarf pulsators does not only allow to detect stratification in their chemical profiles near the surface , it also gives evidence of their core composition .",
    "this , in turn , is dependent on their history of evolution on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and can be used to obtain constraints on the nuclear reaction rates in agb stars .",
    "present results ( metcalfe 2005 ) indicate consistency with evolutionary models .    as white dwarf stars cool ,",
    "their cores become crystallized . being composed mainly of carbon and oxygen , such cores",
    "can be seen as giant diamonds !",
    "massive white dwarf stars begin to crystallize when still in the dav ( zz ceti ) instability strip , and asteroseismic investigations of one such massive pulsator have proven substantial crystallization in its interior ( metcalfe , montgomery & kanaan 2004 , brassard & fontaine 2005 ) .",
    "the light curve shapes of pulsating white dwarf stars of spectral types db and da are often nonsinusoidal .",
    "the nonlinearities originate in their convection zones , that can not instantly adjust to the pulsational variations ( the g mode pulsations of pulsating white dwarf stars are almost exclusively due to temperature changes ; robinson , kepler , & nather 1982 ) .",
    "as the light curve shapes of such pulsators depend on the thermal response time of the convection zone , the latter parameter can be determined from nonlinear light curve fits ( montgomery 2005 ) .    as a final example , there are pulsating white dwarf stars in mass accreting close binary systems .",
    "if the mass transfer rate is in a certain range , the surface temperature of the accreting white dwarf places it in an instability strip .",
    "a handful of such oscillators is known to date ( mukadam et al .",
    "2007 ) , but attempts at asteroseismology have proven difficult due to low amplitudes and unstable mode spectra .    among all classes of pulsating star ( aside from the sun itself ) , asteroseismology of pulsating white dwarf stars",
    "is certainly in the most advanced state .",
    "a new class of such oscillators has recently been proposed , hot dq stars with carbon - dominated atmospheres and temperatures similar to that of the db pulsators ( montgomery et al .",
    "2007 , dufour et al .  2009 ) .",
    "there is little doubt remaining that the variability of these stars is due to pulsation .",
    "theory predicts yet another new type of white dwarf oscillator , da white dwarf stars somewhat hotter than the db pulsators , but observational searches for them have so far been inconclusive ( kurtz et al .",
    "we refer to montgomery ( 2009 ) , and references therein , for more information on asteroseismology of pulsating white dwarf stars .      at about the same time when the necessity for worldwide observing efforts for pulsating white dwarf stars was realized",
    ", the same conclusion was reached for @xmath2  scuti stars , some of which also exhibit complex oscillation spectra composed of g , p and mixed modes of low overtone .",
    "the delta scuti network , founded over 25 years ago , was the first multisite observing collaboration for these stars , followed by a number of others such as stephi or stacc ; a few wet runs were also devoted to @xmath2  scuti stars .",
    "the asteroseismic potential of @xmath2  scuti stars is enormous , but could so far not be fully exploited .",
    "part of the reason is visible in fig .  4 :",
    "the pure p mode spectrum on the zams mainly allows a determination of the stellar mean density . when the scientifically more interesting mixed modes appear , the frequency spectrum is fairly dense and requires a large amount of data and long time base to be resolved observationally .",
    "however , the real stars seldom co - operate in showing many of the potentially excited modes at observable amplitude , inhibiting mode identification by pattern recognition .",
    "in addition , mode amplitudes are often small , counteracting reliable identifications of many modes by applying the methods discussed before .",
    "even though dozens or even hundreds of pulsation modes have been detected in some @xmath2  scuti stars , little has been learnt on their interior structures from asteroseismology so far .",
    "pulsational amplitude limitation of @xmath2  scuti stars is a major problem for theory : what makes the star excite only certain modes , which modes would these be and what determines their amplitudes ?",
    "observational evidence suggests that in evolved stars mode trapping is ( part of ) the answer , and that oscillations with frequencies around those of radial modes are preferentially excited ( breger , lenz , & pamyatnykh , 2009 ) .    for slowly rotating @xmath2  scuti stars gravitational settling and radiative levitation",
    "give rise to chemical surface peculiarities and are believed to deplete the pulsational driving regions .",
    "consequently , am and ap stars are not expected to pulsate , although a few of them do ( kurtz 2000 ) .",
    "this also means that many @xmath2  scuti stars rotate rapidly , which requires special calculations to extract information from their distorted pulsation modes , a field that has made considerable progress in the recent past ( reese et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "some pre - main sequence stars cross the @xmath2  scuti instability strip on their way to the zams , and consequently pulsate .",
    "the interior structures of these stars are fairly simple , which may make them more accessible to asteroseismic investigation compared to their main sequence counterparts .",
    "the oscillation spectra of pre - main sequence and main sequence @xmath2  scuti stars in the same position in the hr diagram are predicted to be different , which may allow an asteroseismic separation ( suran et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "these two classes of high - overtone g mode pulsator , although well separated in effective temperature , share most of their asteroseismic characteristics .",
    "they also share the problems with respect to observations , caused by their long periods : resolving their oscillation spectra requires measurements over a long time baseline , possibly many years .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that most of the known members of these two groups of pulsator were discovered with the hipparcos ( high precision parallax collecting satellite ) mission from its data set spanning over three years ( waelkens et al .",
    "1998 , handler 1999 ) .    as in pulsating white dwarf stars ,",
    "effects of inhomogeneities in stellar structure would manifest themselves in mode trapping and thus in oscillatory behaviour in the g mode periods ( miglio et al .",
    "the dominant inhomogeneity is the change in mean molecular weight at the edge of the convective core , whose size can be measured .",
    "this is a method alternative to measuring the frequency of the @xmath57 mode in p mode pulsators .",
    "several of the spb and @xmath8 doradus stars rotate with periods comparable to their oscillation periods .",
    "this , again , calls for models that take rotation into account with a more sophisticated approach than perturbation theory ; the corresponding work is in progress .",
    "the @xmath8 doradus stars are located in a domain where the influence of convection on the pulsations is significant ; convection is also responsible for the red edge of the @xmath2  scuti instability domain .",
    "modelling with a time dependent convection approach allowed dupret et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to reproduce the observed boundaries of these instability strips , and also to perform predictions of mode excitation in these stars .",
    "the situation for the spb and @xmath8  doradus stars with respect to asteroseismology is therefore the same as for @xmath2  scuti stars : the basic theory is in place , the difficulty remains to find stars permitting the extraction of the required information from the observations .",
    "the @xmath7  cephei stars are massive ( @xmath121 ) early - b main sequence stars that oscillate radially and nonradially in p , g and mixed modes of low radial overtone .",
    "this is roughly the same type of modes as excited in the @xmath2  scuti stars , but asteroseismology has been more successful for @xmath7  cephei stars in the recent past due to several reasons .",
    "the observed frequency spectra are simple enough to provide initial clues for mode identification , yet complicated enough to reveal information about the stars interior structures .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic mode identification methods ( and combinations of both ) could be applied successfully to some @xmath7  cephei stars ( e.g. , de ridder et al .",
    "2004 ) , additionally aided by the large radial velocity to light amplitude ratios ( of the order of several hundreds km / s / mag ) of their pulsation modes .",
    "sufficient information for unique identifications of all modes was obtained ; an example was shown earlier .",
    "asteroseismic modelling was also eased for @xmath7  cephei stars , as radial modes have sometimes been identified ; an example was shown earlier .",
    "this immediately reduces the parameter space in which a seismic model must be sought by one dimension .",
    "due to the evolutionary state of @xmath7  cephei stars ( near the centre of the main sequence ) , a few of the observed nonradial modes are of mixed p / g type , which has provided information about the convective core size and/or differential interior rotation in a number of stars ( e.g. , aerts et al .",
    "2003 , pamyatnykh et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "apart from learning about stellar interiors , asteroseismology of @xmath7  cephei stars has interesting astrophysical implications . given their high masses , they are progenitors of supernovae of type ii which are largely responsible for the chemical enrichment of galaxies .",
    "the evolution of massive stars is strongly affected by rotational mixing and angular momentum transport ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) ; their internal rotation profile is testable by asteroseismology of @xmath7  cephei stars .",
    "however , the field has not yet matured to a point where we can claim satisfactory understanding of all aspects of the physics governing the interior structures of massive main sequence stars .",
    "several questions may be answered by seismic sounding of @xmath7  cephei stars : how strong is differential interior rotation ? how efficient is internal angular momentum transport ( townsend 2009 ) ?",
    "how strong is convective core overshooting ? can all stars between @xmath121 be modelled with the same convective overshooting parameter ?",
    "there are additional questions related to the pulsation physics of @xmath7  cephei stars that need to be addressed .",
    "only the centre of the theoretically predicted @xmath7  cephei instability strip is populated by observed pulsators .",
    "is this an observational shortcoming or a weakness of theory ?",
    "what is the upper mass limit of the @xmath7  cephei stars ?",
    "are there post - main sequence @xmath7  cep stars , contrary to theoretical predictions ?",
    "five different observables strongly depend on the opacities and element mixtures used for theoretical modelling of @xmath7  cephei stars : the radial fundamental to first overtone period ratio , the excited range of pulsation modes , the frequencies of p modes with radial overtones larger than two , the dependence of bolometric flux amplitude on the surface displacement ( daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak 2009 ) and in case of a  hybrid \" pulsator ( see below ) the excited range of g  modes .",
    "most of these observables are largely independent of each other ; modelling of some stars shows that no standard input opacities and element mixtures can explain the pulsation spectra in detail .",
    "therefore , the last question that may be answered from asteroseismology of @xmath7  cephei stars is : where must we improve the input physics for stellar modelling ?",
    "some @xmath7  cephei and spb stars have emission - line spectra and are thus be stars .",
    "these objects rotate rapidly and have circumstellar disks , occasional outbursts etc .",
    "they may also be studied asteroseismically , but their oscillations are hard to be detected and identified , and their rapid rotation requires special theoretical treatment - that is underway .      three types of pulsating subdwarf star are known : long - period subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars that oscillate in high - overtone g modes ( v1093 herculis stars ) , short - period sdb stars pulsating in low - overtone p and g modes ( v361 hydrae stars ) , and the only oscillating subdwarf o ( sdo ) star known to date , a low - overtone p mode pulsator .    although their g modes would allow the sounding of deep interior regions , their faintness , long periods and low amplitudes made v1093 herculis stars escape asteroseismic study so far .",
    "theoretical studies of the sdo pulsator have so far been focused on the problem of mode excitation .",
    "therefore , the only subdwarf pulsators that have been asteroseismically modelled are among the v361 hydrae stars .",
    "this is no easy undertaking as the problem with mode identification and mostly sparse ( but for a few stars rich and highly variable ) frequency spectra again occurs .",
    "it is possible that these objects have steep interior rotation gradients .",
    "pulsation models must also be built upon evolutionary models including the effects of gravitational settling and radiative levitation . in practice , modelling is carried out by surveying parameter space in effective temperature , gravity , mass and hydrogen mass fraction and by seeking best agreement between observed and theoretically predicted oscillation frequencies .",
    "results have been obtained on about a dozen of those stars , and a mass distribution consistent with that expected from a double star evolutionary scenario has been obtained .",
    "charpinet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) elaborated on many aspects of asteroseismic modelling of pulsating subdwarf stars .",
    "the rapidly oscillating ap ( or short : roap ) stars are special among the pulsating stars because their high - overtone p mode oscillations are predominantly governed by a magnetic field that aligns their pulsation axis with the magnetic , and not with the rotation , axis of the stars .",
    "the magnetic field also distorts the pulsations modes , so they can no longer be described with a single spherical harmonic .    because of their short periods and very low amplitudes ( below 1% )",
    "these stars have for many years been studied photometrically only ; an extensive review was given by kurtz & martinez ( 2000 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of roap stars , however , provided a new level of insight , particularly into atmospheric physics of these pulsators .",
    "the reason is that the vertical wavelength of the pulsation modes is shorter than or about the same order of the layer thicknesses of the chemical elements in their atmospheres that are highly stratified by radiative levitation .",
    "therefore the radial velocity amplitudes of the oscillations change with line depth and from one chemical species to the other .",
    "the chemical elements are also inhomogeneously distributed over the surface , allowing three - dimensional studies of the abundances and pulsational geometry ( kurtz 2009 ) .    because of the unique possibilities offered by the atmospheric structure of roap stars , spectroscopy is also much more sensitive in detecting oscillations compared to photometry . as an outstanding example , mkrtichian et al .",
    "( 2008 ) detected a complete @xmath122 mode spectrum for przybylski s star over @xmath123 radial orders and performed some initial seismic modelling .",
    "the low amplitudes of the stochastically excited oscillations of solar - type stars made their observational detection elusive for a long time .",
    "in retrospect , the first detection was made by kjeldsen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but confirmed only several years later .",
    "meanwhile , the observational accuracy has improved to an extent that detections were made in hundreds of stars ( mostly giants ) , and seismic analyses of several were performed .",
    "the potential of solar - like oscillations for seismic sounding is large .",
    "once detected , the pulsation modes are rather easy to be identified because they are high - overtone p modes ; an example was provided earlier .",
    "so are the large and the small frequency separations ( if detectable ) , immediately placing main sequence stars on the ( asteroseismic ) hr diagram .",
    "most interesting , as for all pulsators with nearly - asymptotic frequency spectra , are irregularities in the latter , caused by features in the stellar interiors",
    ". these would for instance be the base of their envelope convection zones , or the helium ionization region .",
    "houdek ( 2009 ) gave an overview of the expected seismic signatures of such features and their astrophysical importance .",
    "the phenomenon of avoided crossing ( fig .",
    "4 ) also takes place in solar - like oscillators once they have reached the subgiant stage , and it makes itself obvious in echelle diagrams ( bedding et al .",
    "2007 ) . as for other types of pulsator",
    ", this would allow an asteroseismic determination of the convective core size ( for stars sufficiently massive to possess a convective core ) .",
    "the limited lifetimes of the intrinsically damped solar - like oscillations enable inferences concerning pulsation mode physics .",
    "the observed power spectra at individual mode frequencies show a multitude of peaks whose overall shape would correspond to a lorentzian .",
    "the half - widths of these lorentzians yield a determination of the mode damping rates ; the _ mode lifetimes _ are inversely proportional to those .",
    "the mode lifetimes are in turn dependent on properties of the surface convection zone .",
    "theoretical predictions of the amplitudes of solar - like oscillators are important not only for understanding their physics , but also for planning observational efforts .",
    "after years of predictions resulting in amplitudes larger than were observed , the incorporation of the mode lifetimes and subsequent computation of _ mode heights _ appear to result in a scaling law that estimates observed amplitudes well ( chaplin et al .",
    "2009 ) , and seems in agreement with measurements up to oscillating giants ( hekker et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "finally , it is worth to note that as all cool stars possess a convective envelope , it can be expected the solar - like oscillations are excited in all of them , up to red supergiants ( kiss et al .",
    "2006 ) .      some of the pulsational instability strips shown in fig .",
    "1 partly overlap .",
    "it is therefore logical to suspect that stars that belong to two different classes of pulsating star , having two different sets of pulsational mode spectra excited simultaneously , may exist .",
    "indeed , a number of those have been discovered .",
    "this is good news for asteroseismology as the information carried by both types of oscillation can be exploited .",
    "the confirmed cases have so far always been high - overtone g modes and low - overtone p modes , as evaluations of the pulsation constants of the oscillations show .",
    "mixed - mode pulsations by themselves are not `` hybrid '' pulsations because they occupy the same frequency domain as pure p  modes",
    ".    there are @xmath2  scuti/@xmath8  doradus stars , @xmath7  cephei / spb stars and long / short - period subdwarf b pulsators .",
    "the main physical difference between the b - type and a / f - type `` hybrid '' pulsators is that in the first group the same driving mechanism excites both types of oscillation , whereas in the @xmath2  scuti/@xmath8  doradus stars two main driving mechanisms are at work .",
    "the cooler @xmath2  scuti stars and all @xmath8  doradus stars should have thin surface convection zones that would support the excitation of solar - like oscillations ( e.g. , samadi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "ongoing searches for such oscillations have so far remained inconclusive , but there has been a report of solar - like oscillations in a @xmath7  cephei star ( belkacem et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the revision in our knowledge of the solar chemical element mixture ( asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) resulted in the prediction of a much larger overlap region between @xmath7  cephei and spb stars in the hr diagram , and the frequency ranges of the excited long and short period modes in `` hybrid '' b - type pulsators suggest that the heavy - element opacities used for stellar model calculations are still too low ( dziembowski & pamyatnykh 2008 , handler et al .",
    "intriguingly , a similar conclusion has been independently obtained from helioseismology ( guzik , keady , & kilcrease 2009 ) .",
    "one of the first hybrid pulsators reported in the literature ( hd 209295 , handler et al .",
    "2002 ) turned out to have its g mode oscillations tidally excited by a another star in a close eccentric orbit .",
    "the changing gravitational influence of the companion gives rise to forced oscillations with frequencies that are integer multiples of the orbital frequency .",
    "the tidal deformation of the pulsating star is similar to a sectoral @xmath29 mode , and such modes are therefore most easily excited .",
    "there are also several known cases of pulsation in ellipsoidal variables .",
    "whereas close binarity represents an additional complication for theoretical asteroseismic studies due to the gravitational distortion of the pulsator , some other cases of binarity can be used to obtain additional constraints for seismic modelling .      the fundamental way to determine stellar physical parameters , in particular masses , is the analysis of detached eclipsing binary systems whose components can be assumed to have evolved as if they were single ( torres et al .",
    "such constraints are most welcome for asteroseismology and therefore it is self - evident that pulsators be sought for in such binaries . to date , several dozens of such systems are known .",
    "most of these would be @xmath2  scuti pulsators , some are @xmath7  cephei stars , but the best studied case is a short - period sdb pulsator .",
    "these objects provide another possibility for mode identification ( nather & robinson 1974 ) : throughout the eclipse , different parts of the stellar surface become invisible . in case of nonradial oscillations , only part of the pulsation modes",
    "is seen , and the light amplitudes and phases change according to the types of mode . in this way",
    ", the oscillation mode can be identified , a method known as _",
    "eclipse mapping _ or _ spatial filtration _",
    "( e.g. , reed , brondel , & kawaler 2005 ) .",
    "another way to gain support for asteroseismic modelling is to study pulsators in stellar clusters . besides the possibility to observe several objects simultaneously ( e.g. via ccd photometry or multifibre spectroscopy )",
    ", cluster stars can be assumed to have originated from the same interstellar cloud .",
    "therefore , they should be of the same age and chemical composition .",
    "these parameters can be well determined from the properties of the cluster itself , and be imposed as a constraint on the seismic modelling procedure of all pulsating cluster members , also known as _ ensemble asteroseismology_.      most observational results reported in this article so far were based on classical ground based observing methods , such as single- and multisite photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "however , a new era in observational asteroseismology has begun .",
    "asteroseismology requires knowledge about as many intrinsic stellar oscillation frequencies as possible , and these often have low amplitude , calling for measurements with the highest accuracy . as this is also a requirement for the search for extrasolar planets ,",
    "synergies between the two fields have emerged .",
    "spectroscopically , asteroseismology has benefited from high precision radial velocity techniques , such as the iodine cell method , originally invented to find extrasolar planets .",
    "measurements of oscillations in distant stars with amplitudes down to 20 cm / s , about one - tenth of human walking speed , have become possible in that way .",
    "only about a dozen spectrographs worldwide are capable of reaching the required precision .",
    "such observations are still therefore expensive in terms of observing time and complexity of data analysis , but new observing networks , such as the stellar observations network group ( song , http://astro.phys.au.dk/song/ ) aim at achieving similar precision on a regular basis .",
    "siamois ( sismomtre interfrentiel  mesurer les oscillations des intrieurs stellaires , mosser et al .",
    "2009 ) is expected to work at the same precision and duty cycle with its single node placed in antarctica .",
    "concerning photometry , the main problem of ground based observations is scintillation , irregular changes in the measured intensity due to anomalous atmospheric refraction caused by turbulent mixing of air with different temperatures .",
    "the solution to this problem is to observe stellar variability from space . here",
    "the synergy with extrasolar planet research is that the measurements have sufficient precision to detect the signature of transits of planets when they pass in front of their host star .    aside from fine - guidance sensor",
    "hubble space telescope photometry , the first asteroseismic data from space were due to an accident .",
    "the main science mission of the wire ( wide - field infrared explorer ) satellite failed due to loss of cooling fluid for the main instrument , but the star trackers , of 52 mm aperture , were consequently used for time - resolved photometry .",
    "an overview of the results can be found in the paper by bruntt & southworth ( 2008 ) ; wire has fully ceased operation in october 2006 .",
    "the first dedicated asteroseismic space mission that was successfully launched is most ( microvariability and oscillations of stars , http://www.astro.ubc.ca/most/ , walker et al .",
    "2003 , matthews 2006 ) .",
    "the spacecraft is in orbit since june 2003 and still continues to provide asteroseismic data with its 15-cm telescope as main instrument .",
    "one of the most interesting results from most was the discovery of high - overtone g mode oscillations in a supergiant b star ( saio et al .   2006 ) , suggesting an extension of the spb star instability domain to the highest luminosities .",
    "the corot ( convection , rotation and transits , baglin 2003 ) mission was successfully launched in december 2006 and hosts a 27-cm telescope .",
    "it observes two fields of @xmath124 degrees on the sky each , one devoted to asteroseismology of a few bright stars , and the other searching for planetary transits in many stars , at the same time performing a high - precision stellar variability survey .",
    "a special volume of astronomy & astrophysics ( 2009 ) reports some of the early corot science .",
    "asteroseismically , the detection of solar - like oscillations in almost a thousand giant stars is remarkable ( hekker et al .  2009 ) .",
    "in addition , one of the most intriguing corot results was the detection of large numbers of variability frequencies in two @xmath2  scuti stars .",
    "interpreted as independent pulsation modes , these would supply hundreds of oscillations to be asteroseismically modelled , reverting the basic problem for the study of these objects : first , there were too few modes available , now there would be too many !",
    "however , doubts have been raised whether all the frequencies extracted from those data would really correspond to normal modes of pulsation , or would rather be a signature of granulation ( kallinger & matthews 2010 ) .",
    "originally designed for the search for earth - like planets in the habitable zone , the latest addition to the asteroseismic space fleet became kepler ( http://www.kepler.nasa.gov ) , launched in march 2009 .",
    "asteroseismology can measure the radii of solar - like oscillators , among which should be planet - hosting stars , to a relative accuracy of 3% .",
    "thus the radii of transiting planets would be known to the same precision .",
    "therefore it was decided to devote a small percentage of the observing time of this space telescope with an effective 95-cm aperture to asteroseismology .",
    "kepler is the most powerful photometry tool for asteroseismology to date and observes a @xmath125 degree field for three years , practically without interruption , providing a time base considerably longer than all other present missions .",
    "initial results of the kepler asteroseismic investigation , based on the first 43 days of science operations , were summarized by gilliland et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "a possible shortcoming of all these asteroseismic space missions is that they observe in only one passband .",
    "therefore all information available for seismic modelling are the targets oscillation frequencies , unless mode identifications are provided by ground - based support observations .",
    "these are often difficult because the larger space telescopes mostly observe faint targets .",
    "the brite - constellation ( bright target explorer , http://www.brite-constellation.at ) mission therefore adopts quite a different strategy .",
    "this mission consists of three pairs of nanosatellites hosting a 3-cm telescope each that will observe in at least two different passbands ( one per satellite ) , facilitating mode identification with the photometric method .",
    "brite - constellation will preferentially observe stars brighter than 5th magnitude and has a large @xmath126 degree field of view .",
    "given the brightness of the science targets , mode identification from high - resolution spectroscopy can also easily be done .",
    "the first pair of satellites are to be launched in early 2011 .    finally , plato ( planetary transits and oscillations , http://sci.esa.int/plato ) is a mission designed to provide a full statistical analysis of exoplanetary systems around nearby and bright stars .",
    "currently in the definition phase , it will host 28 telescopes of 10  cm aperture that will observe two 557 square degree fields for 2.5 years each .",
    "it is intended to observe 100000 stars to a precision of 1  ppm per month and 500000 stars to somewhat poorer accuracy to determine stellar and planetary masses to 1% .",
    "asteroseismology is a research field evolving so rapidly that some of the results reported here will already be outdated when this book appears in print .",
    "given the @xmath1  30-year headstart of helioseismology in comparison , the field now is in its teenage years , but matures rapidly .",
    "the theoretical basis for asteroseismic studies is laid , although far from being perfect .",
    "some of the problems that require solution comprise improved treatment of magnetic fields , convection , internal flows , and fast rotation .",
    "it is still poorly known what causes stellar cycles , and what makes certain classes of pulsator select the types of mode they oscillate in . some asteroseismic results point towards a requirement of still higher heavy - element opacities , which current calculations do not seem capable of providing .",
    "observationally , pulsating white dwarf stars , @xmath7  cephei stars and solar - like oscillators have been studied asteroseismically , and continue to be",
    ". there are high hopes that present asteroseismic space missions will open the @xmath2  scuti , spb , @xmath8  doradus and v1093 herculis stars for interior structure modelling , and further improve the situation for v361 hydrae stars .",
    "future high - precision radial velocity networks and sites will improve our knowledge mostly for solar - like oscillators and roap stars , with the latter guiding theory of stellar pulsation under the influence of rotation and magnetic fields .",
    "the kepler mission will provide asteroseismic results for solar - like oscillators en masse , and a large number of massive stars are expected to be studied with brite - constellation .",
    "the gaia mission ( http://www.rssd.esa.int/gaia ) is expected to provide accurate luminosity determinations for a vast number of asteroseismic targets , tightly constraining the modelling .",
    "it is therefore only appropriate to finish with a quote by eyer & mowlavi ( 2008 ) : now is the time to be an asteroseismologist !",
    "i am grateful to victoria antoci , tim bedding , gnter houdek and mike montgomery for their comments on this manuscript , as well as to joris de ridder and thomas lebzelter for helpful input .",
