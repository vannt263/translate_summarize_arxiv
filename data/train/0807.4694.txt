    "i.e.  @xmath325 is in @xmath322 . replacing @xmath47 by @xmath326 we recognize that our claim follows by induction on the rank of @xmath47 .",

    "it suffices now to show that @xmath342 represents an integer not containing @xmath0 or a prime @xmath343 .",

    "note that the theorem does clearly not hold true for @xmath348 .",
    "for @xmath349 it does not hold true either : the quadratic form @xmath350 represents only numbers @xmath351 and each such @xmath170 contains at least one prime divisor @xmath352 .",

    "moreover , @xmath364 .",
    "replacing @xmath342 by an equivalent form , if necessary , we may assume that @xmath365 and @xmath366 are relatively prime ( since we can find integers @xmath14 and @xmath150 such that @xmath344 is relatively prime to @xmath367 , e.g.  one may take for @xmath14 the product of all primes in @xmath366 dividing @xmath365 but not @xmath368 , and for @xmath150 one may take the product of all primes in @xmath366 not dividing @xmath365 ) .",

    "it remains to show that every ideal class @xmath106 in @xmath382 contains an integral ideal whose norm is in the group of units @xmath383 , where @xmath314 is the ring introduced in theorem  [ thm - diagonalization - over - localizations - of - z ] .",

    "it is obviously closed under multiplication . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath385 is an integral ideal in a class @xmath106 in @xmath384 whose norm is in @xmath291 , then @xmath386 contains the integral ideal @xmath387 ( where @xmath388 denotes euler s @xmath388-function ) , whose norm is again in @xmath291 .",
    "we shall use repeatedly that every ideal class in @xmath389 contains prime ideals of degree one ( as follows e.g.  from  @xcite ) .",

    "since the index of @xmath262 in @xmath389 is 2 we conclude that its index in @xmath384 is  2 and @xmath402 .",
