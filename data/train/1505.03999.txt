    "the second equation of ( [ eq : cf1 - 3 ] ) is just rewriting the total magnetization in terms of its condensate and thermal parts @xmath204 , and an observation that the whole thermal part simply reduces to @xmath205 .",
    "the third formula of ( [ eq : cf1 - 3 ] ) is a bit more tedious to obtain .",
    "it is a peculiar case of a more general formula , valid in any regime , that we shall prove now .",
    "starting from the set of equations @xmath206",
    "@xmath207 @xmath208 one rewrites @xmath209 @xmath210 @xmath211 which shows that @xmath212 and it leads to the third equation of ( [ eq : cf1 - 3 ] ) in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "the algebraic considerations of ( [ eq : cf1 - 3 ] ) lead to the following equation for @xmath213 : @xmath214 where @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 and @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "the quadratic zeeman effect transformed the equation for @xmath213 which was a second degree polynomial for the zero magnetic field , into a third degree polynomial . that polynomial has three roots .",
    "one needs to select , among those solutions , the only one that is physical : real , non - negative , and with values between @xmath220 and @xmath2 . to avoid numerical difficulties , one can find analytical solutions of this equation using for instance cardan s method , and select the one that has the proper limit when @xmath221 . to do it",
    "one defines : @xmath222 which allows to put the polynomial into the form : @xmath223 with @xmath224 @xmath225 then , one writes : @xmath226 and notices that @xmath227 and @xmath228 are solutions of @xmath229 then one introduces @xmath230 numerically , it appears that @xmath231 and @xmath232 , which means that there are three solutions : @xmath233 where @xmath234 . to find @xmath235",
    ", one has to keep in mind that @xmath236 eventually , one finds that @xmath237 should always be selected for @xmath213 because it is the only solution that gives the appropriate limit when @xmath221 .",
    "then , having @xmath213 , one can easily calculate @xmath153 , @xmath154 with the first and second equations of ( [ eq : cf1 - 3 ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we explain how to compute numerically the transition temperatures @xmath82 and @xmath95 for any fixed magnetization .",
    "there is an additional difficulty to compute @xmath82 compared to the case when @xmath150 , since its definition involves @xmath238 , which is unknown .",
    "one can determine @xmath112 from the constant of motion @xmath239 , but to do so , one has to know the value of @xmath82 , as can be seen from the following sets of equations : @xmath240 @xmath241 if @xmath61 , and @xmath242 @xmath243 if @xmath63 .",
    "there are no further independent equations available for those two quantities , so they have to be solved in a self - consistent way .",
    "let us suppose that the magnetization is such that the system is in the area where @xmath61 .",
    "one knows the value of @xmath82 without magnetic field , and one can sensibly expect that if a magnetic field is switched on , the critical temperature will be of the same order of magnitude as it used to be , so one puts the value of @xmath82 in the absence of any field @xmath244 to compute the value of @xmath112 , and then puts this value into ( [ eq : t11 ] ) to compute the corrected value of @xmath82 , that can be used in ( [ eq : t12 ] ) to compute @xmath112 .",
    "those operations should be performed as many times as needed to make the effect of the wrong initial value disappear .",
    "the convergence is fast , and after few steps one is close to the fixed point for @xmath82 .",
    "one can proceed in the same way using ( [ eq : t11bis ] ) and ( [ eq : t12bis ] ) if @xmath63 , but how is it possible to know at once if one is in this case or in the other ?",
    "one does not know it , but it is of no importance whatsoever if one uses a little trick familiar to chemists . at the beginning one",
    "makes some assumption , and then checks if the computed value @xmath112 is consistent with this guess . if not , then it means that the assumption was wrong , and that the system is in the other area .",
    "one should begin calculations again .",
    "numerical problems can occur if one is really near to the border between the two areas , so one needs to be careful .    eventually , to find the second critical temperature ,",
    "one computes the only solution of the equation in @xmath95 @xmath245 if @xmath61 , or @xmath246 if @xmath63 .",
    "the bisection method allows to find this value with the requested accuracy , taking @xmath220 for the lower bound and the temperature @xmath82 for the upper bound .",
