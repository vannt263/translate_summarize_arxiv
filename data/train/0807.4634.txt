    "these stars are called population iii ( popiii ) stars , and at least some of them are expected to quickly release metals in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; therefore later generations would soon be metal enriched .",

    "the lyman @xmath4 line is clearly asymmetric , being steeper on the blue side , has a very large equivalent width , at least 80  in the rest frame , and a luminosity of @xmath8 .",
    "no continuum is detected at shorter wavelengths , while it is present redward of the line .",
    "these characteristics and the fact that the heii 1640  line is expected in a region of the j  band relatively free of sky emissions make kcs 1166 a very good candidate for the search of popiii stars .",

    "* fosbury et al . ( 2003 ) ) on the lynx arc , since these could well mark the first detection of popiii stars , and are completely overlooked by the relevant literature .",
    "although we recommend the interested reader to read the paper by fosbury et al .",
    "directly , we give here a summary of their work .",
    "the lynx arc is a dwarf hii galaxy at z=3.357 , lensed by the z=0.570 cluster rx j0848 + 4456 , and it has been discovered serendipitously by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* holden et al . ( 2001 ) ) during spectroscopic follow  up of the cluster .",
    "the hii galaxy is magnified by a factor of about 10 , as evaluated by a detailed analysis of the complex cluster environment from hst wfpc2 images .",
    "the unusual emission line spectrum has been thoroughly studied with the lris , esi and nirspec at the keck telescopes , covering the rest ",
    "frame ranges 9002500 and 33005700 .",
    "it shows strong and self  absorbed lyman @xmath4 line and civ 1548,1551doublet , strong intercombination lines of niv ] 1483,1487 , ciii ] 1907,1909 , and oiii ] 1661,1666 , moderate heii 1640 , absent [ oii ] 3727,3729 .",
    "the doublet siiii ] 1883,1892  is clearly detected in the esi spectrum , and is 40 times brighter , relative to h@xmath9 , than foreseen by models with scaled solar abundances .",
    "the intercombination lines have a very narrow width ( @xmath10 ) , indicating a small gravitating mass of about @xmath11 , typical of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the absence of nv 1240  and the weakness of niii ] 1750  indicate that the ionizing source is a blackbody , rather than a power law , as it would be expected in case of ionization by an agn .",
    "the intensity of the continuum observed longward of lyman @xmath4 is completely explained by the nebular continuum , as accurately predicted from the observed strength of h@xmath9 .",
    "the continuum produced by an instantaneous burst of @xmath12 , salpeter imf , z=0.05@xmath13 , age of 1 to 5 myr would be seen in the data , if it were present , but would produce an ionizing flux 20 times lower than the one necessary to produce the observed emission lines : this type of continuum , therefore , can not be the source of ionization .",
    "the photoionization model reproducing all the observed features has a black  body ionizing source with : a ) a black  body temperature of 80000k , much higher than the effective temperature of galactic compact hii regions , which does not exceed 40000k ; b ) an ionization parameter u=0.1 , also higher than in local hii regions ; c ) a low _ nebular _ metallicity z=0.05@xmath14 .",
    "the lack of stellar continuum longward of lyman @xmath4 , the strong necessary ionizing flux , and the small stellar mass all indicate that the ionizing flux should be produced by fewer than @xmath15 hot stars , formed with a top  heavy imf , and most likely with a metallicity still lower than the nebular one .",
    "the substantial overabundance of silicon in the nebula indicate enrichment by past pair instability supernovae , as those resulting from the total disruption of stars with 140260 @xmath16 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hegel & woosley 2002 ) ) .",
    "all these characteristics point strongly to the presence of popiii stars , some of which might have already exploded to partially enrich the ism .",
    "however in a dwarf galaxy like the linx arc , the formation of popii stars could have been delayed long enough to make the uncontaminated uv signature of popiii stars detectable at intermediate redshift .",
    "in fact this uncontaminated signature of popiii stars might have a much shorter duration in the massive galaxies , which are the only observable galaxies at high redshift .",
    "this might be the reason why popiii stars have not yet been detected at high redshift , where they have been searched so far , following the obvious paradigm that primordial material is more abundant in the very young universe .    in a contribution to a conference (",
    "* schaerer ( 2004 ) ) finds it unlikely that the lynx arc contains an extremely metal poor cluster , because the ism metallicity is 1/20 solar and there are no know cases of the stellar metallicity lower than the nebular one , and the alternative explanation of an obscured agn ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* binette et al . 2003 ) ) seems to be capable of reproducing the observed spectrum .",
    "however , it should not be surprising that new phenomena are observed when dealing with a new class of objects , like popiii stars , and binette et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find it plausible that the stellar metallicity might be lower than the nebular one .",
    "furthermore , of the 5 models presented by binette et al .",
    "( 2003 ) the one that best fits the observed line ratios of the lynx arc is the hot star ( 80000 k ) model , which is relevant for popiii and which has only one inconsistent line , si iii ] 1883,1892 , whose discrepancy could in any case be due to the nucleosynthetic signature of pair instability supernovae , as explained above .",
    "the other 4 models also have discrepant si iii ] 1883,1892 , but in addition have at least two more lines inconsistent with the observations .",
    "therefore the most likely explanations for the observed spectrum of the lynx arc remains the very hot star model expected for popiii stars .",
    "although we are yet unable to report on the results of our observations of the heii 1640  line in kcs 1166 , which is a good candidate for popiii search at z=6.518 , it is well possible that popiii stars have already been detected by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fosbury et al . ( 2003 ) ) in a dwarf star  forming galaxy at z=3.357 , thanks to the fortunate combination of the longer uncontaminated popiii phase in dwarf galaxies and of the opportunity given by the lensing magnification to identify popiii stars , even if not at their peak activity",
    ".    clearly further detections of popiii stars , or stringent upper limits , would be extremely important to understand the connection between reionization and metal production , since popiii stars should be major players on both scenes , and could spoil the simple proportionality between ionizing photons and metals , claimed by some ( see e.g. the contribution by a. ferrara to these proceedings ) .",
    "we would like to thank bob fosbury and raffaella schneider for very useful comments ."
