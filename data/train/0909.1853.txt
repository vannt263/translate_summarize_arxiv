    "in @xcite , khovanov introduces his categorification of the jones polynomial , a graded homology theory , which is a powerful link invariant . as with the jones",

    "a number of programs have been written to compute the khovanov homology of a link .",
    "the programs by bar - natan and green can be implemented in mathematica @xcite .",
    "a faster program called khoho was written by shumakovitch @xcite .",
    "of course , one must have a finite description of the knot or link , in order to use these programs to obtain its khovanov homology .",
    "we set out to find the khovanov homology of infinite classes of knots , in particular infinite classes of pretzel knots .",
    "lee proves in @xcite that the khovanov homology of alternating links ( over rational coefficients ) is completely determined by the jones polynomial and knot signature .",
    "then in @xcite manolescu and ozvth define a larger class of knots they call quasi - alternating links and extend lee s results to this class . in @xcite",
    "the quasi - alternating status of pretzel links is explored by champanerkar and kofman .",
    "they classify many pretzel links as either quasi - alternating , or not , leaving open the status of only @xmath6 classes of @xmath7 column pretzel links : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "greene completes this classification in @xcite , and finds that the @xmath8 knots are not quasi - alternating , when @xmath10 thus their khovanov homology is not necessarily determined by their jones polynomial and signature .",
    "we look at the khovanov homology of the @xmath8 knots ( @xmath11 , @xmath3 odd ) .",
    "we utilize the simplicity of the diagrams resulting from resolving one of the crossings in the @xmath12 column , to make an inductive argument in terms of @xmath4 , which is completed using the fact that these are slice knots .",
    "thus , given a satisfactory base case for some odd value of @xmath3 , we can provide a formula for the khovanov homology of all @xmath8 knots for @xmath4 sufficiently high .",
    "we show the explicit proof for the @xmath13 case , which applies in exactly the same manner for other values of @xmath3 once we compute a base case meeting certain criteria .",
    "we have already verified that such base cases exist for all odd values @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the free graded module generated by two elements , @xmath16 and @xmath17 over a ring @xmath18 .",
    "we assign a @xmath4-grading to @xmath15 so that the copy of @xmath18 generated by @xmath16 has @xmath4-grading @xmath19 and the copy of @xmath18 generated by @xmath17 has @xmath4-grading @xmath20 .",
    "this induces a @xmath4-grading on @xmath21 where the copy of @xmath18 generated by @xmath22 has @xmath4-grading equal to the sum of the @xmath4-gradings of @xmath23 through @xmath24 .",

    "let @xmath26 denote a @xmath4-grading shift up by @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath31    @xmath32      for any given crossing there are two ways to resolve the crossing to eliminate it .",
    "we call these the @xmath34-smoothing and the @xmath19 smoothing according to the convention in figure [ smoothings ] .     and @xmath19 resolutions of a crossing ]    given a knot or link diagram @xmath35 , with @xmath33 crossings , there are @xmath36 different total resolutions of the diagram .",
    "each total resolution is a collection of simple closed curves .",
    "additionally , each resolution corresponds to an @xmath33-tuple of @xmath34s and @xmath19s .",

    "each of the edges of the @xmath33-cube corresponds to a change of one crossing from a @xmath34-smoothing to a @xmath19-smoothing .",
    "we label this edge with a map .",
    "the map is labeled @xmath29 if two circles in the @xmath34-smoothing merge to one circle in the @xmath19-smoothing , and @xmath30 if one circle in the @xmath34-smoothing divides into two in the @xmath19-smoothing .",
    "we add in signs so that each square anti - commutes .",

    "@xmath44 in other words , if we align the vertices of the @xmath33-cube such that vertices of the same weight are in the same column as above , we simply take the direct sum down each column .",
    "the differentials are given by the sums of the maps in the cube from smoothings of weight @xmath45 to smoothings of weight @xmath46 . because each square anticommutes , @xmath47 .",

    "additionally their union consists of all the vertices of @xmath43 and @xmath43 is the total complex of @xmath64 .",

    "lee considers a similar construction in @xcite .",
    "her complex comes from the same @xmath33-cube of smoothings , and the modules associated to the vertices are the same as khovanov s , although lee chooses the coefficient ring to be the rational numbers .",

    "important note : * while it is typical in writing the spectral sequence for a filtered differential graded module , @xmath15 to use notation such that @xmath82 and the @xmath83 differential has bidegree @xmath84 it is more natural in this context to let @xmath85 . using this indexing",
    ", the @xmath83 differential has bidegree @xmath86 ( homological degree increases by @xmath19 and filtration degree increases by @xmath87 ) .",
    "lee proves that the rank of @xmath88 is simply determined by the number of components of the link , @xmath89 . if @xmath89 has @xmath33 components the rank of @xmath88 is @xmath36",

    "@xcite rasmussen asks , what are the @xmath4-gradings of these two remaining copies of @xmath0 in the @xmath93 page of the spectral sequence described above ?",
    "he proves that the difference between the two @xmath4-gradings is exactly @xmath6 and then defines an invariant @xmath94 to be the average of these two @xmath4-gradings .",
    "furthermore he proves that @xmath94 provides a lower bound on the slice genus of the knot : @xmath95",
    "we compute the khovanov homology for the class of @xmath96 pretzel knots . this same proof can be used to compute @xmath8 knots once an appropriate base case for the induction can be found .",
    "let @xmath97 , the 3-stranded pretzel knot where @xmath98 . then @xmath99 and @xmath100 for all other values of @xmath101 .",
    "we proceed by induction on @xmath4 .",
    "the case for @xmath102 can be verified computationally @xcite .    for @xmath103",
    "we consider the following 3 diagrams :    notice that @xmath104 is the diagram @xmath35 with the last crossing in the last column resolved in the @xmath34-smoothing .",
    "likewise @xmath105 is @xmath35 with the crossing resolved in the @xmath19-smoothing .",
    "therefore we have the long exact sequence from section 2.4 ( equation [ les ] ) . @xmath106",
    "we observe that @xmath104 is a diagram for the @xmath6-component unlink .",
    "therefore @xmath107 whichever orientation we put on @xmath104 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "therefore @xmath110 inserting these values into the long exact sequence [ les ] we get the following @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .",
    "this implies that @xmath113 for @xmath114 .    noticing that @xmath105 is a diagram for the @xmath115 pretzel knot",
    ", we can use the inductive hypothesis to get its khovanov homology . noticing that for @xmath105 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 the unnormalized khovanov homology for @xmath105 is given by the column on the left below .",
    "the right hand column shifts the gradings by @xmath19 , to give the appropriate isomorphisms .",
    "@xmath116 after we shift the gradings back to get @xmath56 , we find that we have proven the result for @xmath117 for all @xmath118 .",
    "we are left to find @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( which normalize to @xmath121 and @xmath122 under the grading shifts ) .",
    "we have the following exact sequence from the long exact sequence    @xmath123    since @xmath124 and @xmath125 preserve @xmath4-grading , basic linear algebra implies that @xmath126 since @xmath127 is injective , @xmath128 therefore @xmath129 this results in @xmath130 possibilities for the isomorphism class of @xmath119 . using the exact sequence ( [ ses ] )",
    ", we can determine the isomorphism class of @xmath120 corresponding to each of these @xmath130 possibilities : @xmath131 after normalization these four possibilities are : @xmath132 we aim to show that the first of these four possibilities is correct .",
    "we now utilize the results of lee and rasmussen , described in section 3 .",
    "in particular we recall rasmussen s invariant , @xmath94 and its relation to the slice genus .",
    "@xmath133    @xmath134 and thus @xmath135 .",
    "we observe that there is a cobordism between @xmath136 and the two component unlink .",
    "we may resolve one crossing of @xmath136 to obtain a diagram of a link in the isotopy class of the two component unlink .",
    "resolving the crossing amounts to adding in a band splitting the knot into two components .",
    "( see figure [ cobordism ] ) .",
    "we may then cap off the unlink end with 2 discs to obtain a disc bounding @xmath136 .",
    "therefore @xmath136 is a slice knot ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath138 so @xmath135 .",
    "we now complete the proof . because @xmath139 , the remaining copies of @xmath0 in the @xmath93 page of lee s spectral sequence must be in @xmath4-gradings @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "the only copies of @xmath0 in those gradings in the @xmath80 term are in the @xmath78 homological grading ( table [ spectral ] )",
    ". therefore all differentials on these two copies of @xmath0 must be trivial so that they survive to the @xmath93 page .",
    "all other copies of @xmath0 on the @xmath140 page must not survive to the @xmath93 page .",
    "@xmath141    recall that the @xmath83 differential goes up @xmath19 and over @xmath87 , because of an indexing that differs from the standard indexing for a spectral sequence induced by a fibration .",
    "( see the note in section 3.1 for further explanation ) .",
    "let @xmath142 denote the differential on the @xmath83 page from @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "we know that @xmath145 and @xmath146 acts trivially on one copy of @xmath0 for every @xmath87 based on the value of @xmath147 . because the row corresponding to the second homological grading has only @xmath34s , @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "therefore if @xmath150 , an additional copy of @xmath0 will survive in @xmath151 , contradicting lee s result that there can only be two copies of @xmath0 on the @xmath93 page . because the row corresponding to the first homological grading has @xmath34s in @xmath4-gradings greater than @xmath7 , @xmath152 @xmath149.therefore",
    "if @xmath153 , an additional copy of @xmath0 will survive in @xmath154 , again contradicting lee s result .",
    "therefore @xmath155 , and the khovanov homology of @xmath136 is as stated in the theorem .",
    "while lee s spectral sequence only applies to khovanov homology with coefficients in @xmath0 , the long exact sequence applies with arbitrary coefficients . we can compute a base case over @xmath5 using @xcite or @xcite",
    ". then we obtain isomorphisms as in the previous section @xmath156 for @xmath114 which determines the values of @xmath157 in homological degree @xmath158 .",
    "the values in homological degree @xmath159 or @xmath160 completely determined by the base case .",
    "we note that support of the khovanov homology in these homological degrees lies in the two main diagonals .",
    "the values in homological degree @xmath161 are determined by @xmath162 . given our results over @xmath0 combined with the interesting part of the long exact sequence , we find that @xmath163 and @xmath164 is either only @xmath34 or has some torsion contained in the two main diagonals .",
    "we illustrate this process in tables [ khov336 ] and [ khov337 ] , indicating where the inductive step allows for one torsion factor with the marking @xmath165 .",
    "in fact @xmath166 in these particular cases ( verifyable by computation ) , and conjecturally @xmath166 for all @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath167    @xmath168    the @xmath96 pretzel knots for @xmath169 have thin khovanov homology .    combining this with greene s result that these knots are not quasi - alternating @xcite",
    ", we find that we have an infinite class of non - quasi - alternating knots with thin khovanov homology .",
    "we generalize this result in the next section to other odd values of @xmath3 .",
    "note that for even values of @xmath3 , the khovanov homology of the link appears to have torsion off the main diagonals and thus is not thin .",
    "we can make the same argument to compute the khovanov homology of other @xmath1 pretzel knots , providing we have a base case knot @xmath170 that satisfies the following conditions    1 .",
    "@xmath171 2 .",
    "@xmath172 3 .",
    "@xmath173 for @xmath174    ( alternatively we could have @xmath175 and @xmath173 for @xmath176 which is the case for the mirror images of these knots ) .",
    "the other nontrivial groups will determine the formula for the khovanov homology of the @xmath8 knots .",
    "namely , all @xmath8 knots with @xmath4 greater than or equal to the value of @xmath4 in the base case , will have @xmath177 , then @xmath173 for @xmath178 where @xmath179 is some constant determined by the base case .",
    "the subsequent groups will be shifted versions of the higher nontrivial groups in the base case .",
    "we have computationally verified that we have base cases satisfying these two conditions for odd values @xmath180 .",
    "in particular the base case for these values of @xmath3 always occurs in the @xmath181 knot .",
    "( recall that in the case @xmath13 , the base case is @xmath182 . )",
    "we suspect that in general the knot @xmath181 will provide the appropriate base case .",
    "furthermore , after examining the first few cases , a clear pattern seems to arise . we can therefore extend the result slightly    for @xmath183 ( and conjecturally for higher values of @xmath3 ) the khovanov homology for @xmath8 over rational coefficients is @xmath184 where @xmath185 .",
