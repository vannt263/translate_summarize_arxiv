    "the system of @xmath0 nonintersecting elastic lines was first studied by de gennes  @xcite as a simple model of a fibrous structure made of @xmath1-dimensional nonintersecting flexible chains in thermal equilibrium , under a unidirectional stretching force .",
    "these elastic lines can also be viewed as the trajectories in time of @xmath0 nonintersecting brownian motions , a system studied in great detail by fisher and co - workers  @xcite in the context of commensurate - incommensurate ( c - ic ) phase transitions . in this context",
    "the nonintersecting lines are the domain walls between different commensurate surface phases adsorbed on a crystalline substrate .",
    "the ` nonintersection ' constraint led fisher to call this a problem of ` vicious ' random walkers who do not meet ( or kill each other when they meet ) .",
    "since then , the vicious walkers model has had many physical applications , e.g. , in wetting and melting  @xcite , as a simple model of polymer network  @xcite , in the structure of vicinal surfaces of crystals consisting of terraces divided by steps  @xcite and also in the context of stochastic growth models  @xcite .",
    "depending on the underlying physical system being modelled by @xmath0 vicious walkers , one can pose and study a variety of statistical questions .",
    "for example , huse and fisher  @xcite studied the so called ` reunion ' probability , i.e. , the probability @xmath3 that @xmath0 vicious walkers starting at the same position in space reunite exactly after time @xmath4 at their same initial position but without crossing each other in the time interval @xmath5 $ ] and showed that it decays as a power law @xmath6 for large @xmath4 .",
    "another pertinent issue is : given that the @xmath0 walkers have reunited for the first time at time @xmath4 , what can one say about the statistics of the transverse fluctuations of the positions of the walkers at any intermediate time @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ? such configurations where @xmath0 walkers emerge from a fixed point in space and reunite at the same point after a fixed time @xmath4 are called ` watermelons ' as their structure resembles that of a watermelon ( see fig .",
    "such a watermelon configuration also describes the structure of the ` droplet ' or the elementary topological excitation ( vortex - antivortex pair ) on the commensurate ( ordered ) side of a c - ic phase transition  @xcite with the longitudinal distance between the pairs being @xmath4 .",
    "the statistical ( thermal ) fluctuations of the transverse sizes of such watermelon defects play an important role near the phase transition .",
    "this initiated a study of the tranverse fluctuations of the nonintersecting lines in the watermelon geometry with fixed longitudinal distance @xmath4 . in the random walk / probability language , this means studying the transverse fluctuations of the trajectories of @xmath0 walkers conditioned on the fact that they started and reunited at the same point in space after a fixed time @xmath4 without crossing each other in between .",
    "another similar interesting geometrical configuration is a ` watermelon with a wall ' , i.e , @xmath0 nonintersecting walkers starting and reuniting at the same point in space ( say the origin ) after a fixed time @xmath4 , but staying positive in @xmath5 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     nonintersecting brownian motions over the time interval @xmath8 . ]",
    "recently , the transverse fluctuations of @xmath0 nonintersecting lines have been studied extensively in watermelon geometry over @xmath5 $ ] both with and without a wall and important connections to random matrix theory have been discovered  @xcite .",
    "for example , the joint distribution of the positions of all the walkers at a fixed time @xmath9 for watermelons without a wall was shown to be identical ( after appropriate rescaling ) to the joint distribution of eigenvalues of a gaussian random matrix belonging to the unitary ( gue ) ensemble  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the joint distribution of the positions at a fixed time @xmath7 for watermelons with a hard wall at the origin was computed recently  @xcite and was shown to be identical ( after an appropriate change of variable ) to the joint distribution of eigenvalues of a random matrix drawn from the wishart ( or laguerre ) ensemble at a special value of its parameters , which also corresponds to the chiral gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrices @xcite .",
    "it is useful at this point to recollect the definition of a wishart matrix .",
    "a wishart matrix @xmath10 is an @xmath11 square matrix of the product form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a @xmath14 rectangular matrix with real or complex entries and @xmath15 is its hermitian conjugate .",
    "if the entries @xmath16 represent some data , e.g. , @xmath16 may indicate the price of the @xmath17-th commodity on the @xmath18-th day , then @xmath10 is just the ( unnormalized ) covariance matrix that provides informations about the correlations between prices of different commodities .",
    "if @xmath13 is a gaussian random matrix , @xmath19 $ ] where the dyson index @xmath20 corresponds respectively to real and complex matrices , then the random covariance matrix @xmath10 belongs to the wishart ensemble named after wishart who introduced them in the context of multivariate statistical data analysis  @xcite .",
    "since then the wishart matrix has found numerous applications .",
    "wishart matrices play an important role in data compression techniques such as the `` principal components analysis '' ( pca ) .",
    "pca applications include image processing  @xcite , biological microarrays  @xcite , population genetics  @xcite , finance  @xcite , meteorology and oceanography  @xcite .",
    "the spectral properties of the wishart matrices have been studied extensively and it is known  @xcite that for @xmath21 , all @xmath0 positive eigenvalues of @xmath10 are distributed via the joint probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a normalization constant and the dyson index @xmath20 ( respectively for real and complex @xmath13 ) . in the `` anti - wishart '' case , that is when @xmath24 , @xmath10 has @xmath25 positive eigenvalues ( and @xmath26 eigenvalues that are exactly zero ) and their joint probability distribution is simply obtained by exchanging @xmath25 and @xmath0 in the formula ( [ eq : wishart0 ] ) . hence",
    "we will focus only on the wishart case with @xmath21 .",
    "note that even though the wishart pdf in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wishart0 ] ) was obtained for _ integer _",
    "@xmath21 , the pdf is actually a valid measure for any _ real continuous _",
    "in particular , for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in the case @xmath2 , the pdf in eq . is realized as the distribution of the squares of positive eigenvalues of class @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) random matrices @xcite , in the classification of altland and zirnbauer @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pdf in eq . is also realized for @xmath31-dimensional squared bessel processes under nonintersection constraint with @xmath2 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the joint pdf of the positions of @xmath0 nonintersecting brownian motions in the ` watermelon with a wall ' geometry , mentioned in the previous paragraph , was shown to correspond to the joint pdf of wishart ensemble in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wishart0 ] ) with special values of the parameter @xmath2 and @xmath34 . at these special values ,",
    "the joint pdf also correspond to those of the squares of the eigenvalues of class @xmath29 matrices @xcite .",
    "a question thus naturally arises whether it is possible to find a nonintersecting brownian motion model that will generate a wishart ensemble in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wishart0 ] ) with arbitrary values of the two parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this paper",
    "we address precisely this issue and show how to generate the wishart ensemble with arbitrary positive @xmath35 and @xmath36 , starting from an underlying microscopic model of nonintersecting brownian motions .",
    "in this paper we study the nonintersecting brownian motions in a geometry different from that of the watermelons discussed above . here",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 @xmath1-dimensional nonintersecting fluctuating elastic interfaces with heights @xmath37 ( @xmath38 that run across the interval @xmath39 $ ] in the longitudinal direction ( see fig .",
    "equivalently the heights @xmath40 can be thought of as the positions of @xmath0 nonintersecting walkers at ` time ' @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast to the watermelon geometry , the lines here are not constrained to reunite at the two end points .",
    "instead , each line satisfies the periodic boundary condition in the longitudinal direction , i.e. , they are wrapped around a cylinder of perimeter @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in addition",
    ", there is a hard wall ( or substrate ) at @xmath43 that induces an external confining potential @xmath44 on the @xmath18-th interface for all @xmath45 . in a slightly more general version of the model",
    ", one can also introduce a pairwise repulsive interaction between lines .",
    "in presence of the external confining potential @xmath44 , the system of elastic lines reaches a thermal equilibrium and our main goal is to compute the statistical properties of the heights of these lines at thermal equilibrium .",
    "more precisely , we compute the joint distribution of heights of the lines at a fixed position @xmath46 and show that , in the limit @xmath47 ( large system ) , this joint distribution , after an appropriate change of variables , is precisely the same as the joint distribution in the wishart ensemble .",
    "note that due to the translational symmetry in the longitudinal direction ( imposed by the periodic boundary condition ) , this joint pdf of the heights is actually independent of @xmath41 .     for @xmath46 with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath48 . ]",
    "thus our model is actually closer to the solid - on - solid ( sos ) models at thermal equilibrium in presence of a substrate  @xcite , except with the difference that here we have multiple nonintersecting interfaces .",
    "this model is thus appropriate to describe the interfaces between different co - existing ` wet ' phases of a multiphase two - dimensional fluid system on a solid substrate or a film  @xcite .",
    "we note that nonintersecting brownian motions in an external harmonic potential was studied recently by bray and winkler  @xcite , but they were mostly interested in calculating the probability that such walkers all survive up to some time @xmath4 .",
    "in the brownian motion language , we are here interested in a different question : given that each walker survives up to ` time ' @xmath42 and comes back to its starting position , what is the joint distribution of the positions of the walkers ( or equivalently the heights of the interfaces ) at any intermediate ` time ' @xmath46 ?    in this paper , we consider the external confining potential of the form @xmath49 with a harmonic confining part and a repulsive inverse square interaction .",
    "such a choice is dictated by the following observations .",
    "the harmonic potential is needed to confine the interfaces as otherwise there will be a zero mode .",
    "the repulsive inverse square potential has an entropic origin . for a single interface near a hard wall ,",
    "fisher @xcite indeed showed that the effective free energy at temperature @xmath50 behaves as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the distance of the interface ( or the walker ) from the wall .",
    "thus it is natural to choose the external potential of the form as in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "in addition , as we will see later , such a physical choice also has the advantage that it is exactly soluble .",
    "we will see indeed that this choice of the potential generates , for the joint density of heights at a fixed point @xmath41 and in the limit of a large system ( @xmath47 ) , a wishart pdf in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wishart0 ] ) with fixed @xmath2 , but with a tunable @xmath53 where @xmath54 sets the amplitude of the repulsive inverse square potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "thus when @xmath55 is a positive integer @xmath56 , this generates a physical realization of wishart matrices with integer dimensions @xmath57 and @xmath0 .",
    "our model is also rather close to the realistic experimental system of fluctuating step edges on vicinal surfaces of a crystal in presence of a substrate ( or hard wall ) .",
    "when a crystal is cut by a plane which is oriented at a small nonzero angle to the high - symmetry axis , one sees a sequence of terraces oriented in the high - symmetry direction that are separated by step edges which can be modelled as ` elastic ' nonintersecting lines or trajectories of nonintersecting brownian motions  @xcite . in an external confining harmonic potential but in absence of a wall at @xmath43 ( such that @xmath58 symmetry is preserved )",
    ", the joint distribution of the heights of the lines at equilibrium can be mapped to the gue ensemble  @xcite , although most studies in this context are concerned with the so called terrace - width distribution , i.e. , the distribution of the spacings between the lines . in our model , due to the presence of the wall which breaks the @xmath59 symmetry , new interesting questions emerge .",
    "for example , it is natural also to ask for the distribution of the minimal ( maximal ) height , i.e. , the height of the line closest ( farthest ) from the wall . using the mapping to the wishart random matrix , the minimal and maximal height correspond respectively to the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of the wishart random matrix .",
    "in addition , it is also interesting and physically relevant to investigate the statistics of the center of mass of the @xmath0 nonintersecting brownian motions",
    ". we will see that strong correlations between the lines violate the central limit theorem resulting in strong non - gaussian tails in the distribution of the center of mass .",
    "let us summarize below our main results .",
    "0.2 cm    @xmath60 using a path integral formalism we show that the computation of the equilibrium joint distribution of heights at a fixed point in space can be mapped to determining the spectral properties of a quantum hamiltonian .",
    "subsequently , when the external potential is of the form in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , this quantum potential turns out to be integrable and allows us to compute the equilibrium joint distribution of heights exactly .",
    "in particular in the limit of a large system ( @xmath47 ) , we show that the joint distribution of heights , under a change of variables @xmath61 , is exactly of the wishart form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wishart0 ] ) with parameters @xmath2 and @xmath62 where @xmath54 appears in the potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) . knowing the exact joint distribution",
    ", we then compute various statistical properties of the heights of the interfaces as listed below .",
    "0.2 cm    @xmath60 we find that the average density of lines at height @xmath52 , in the limit of a large number @xmath0 of interfaces , is a quarter of ellipse as a function of @xmath52 , with finite support over @xmath63 $ ] where @xmath64 appears in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the typical height thus scales with @xmath0 for large @xmath0 as @xmath65 .",
    "this differs considerably from the case of @xmath0 interfaces that are allowed to cross , where the typical height is of order one .",
    "the spreading of nonintersecting interfaces is a consequence of the strong interaction between them induced by their fermionic repulsion .",
    "0.2 cm    @xmath60 we study the height distribution of the topmost ( farthest from the wall ) interface in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we show that the average height of the farthest interface ( maximal height ) is @xmath66 for large @xmath0 : it is given by the upper bound of the average density of states .",
    "the typical fluctuations of the maximal height around its mean are distributed via the tracy - widom distribution @xcite . however ,",
    "for finite but large @xmath0 , the tails of the distribution of the maximal height show significant deviations from the tracy - widom behavior .",
    "we compute exactly these large deviation tails .",
    "0.2 cm    @xmath60 we also study the statistics of the height of the lowest ( closest to the wall ) interface ( minimal height ) and argue that , for large @xmath0 , it scales as @xmath67 .",
    "this should be compared to the case of non - interacting brownian motions where the typical distance of the closest ( to the wall ) walker is of @xmath68 from the wall .",
    "this is again an effect of the strong interaction between the interfaces : their mutual repulsion pushes the lowest interface closer to the substrate .",
    "we further show that the full distribution of the minimal height can be exactly computed for a special value of the parameter @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "0.2 cm    @xmath60 finally we study the distribution of the center of mass of the heights @xmath70 for large @xmath0 .",
    "thanks to the analogy between the wishart eigenvalues and a coulomb gas of charges , the mean and variance of the center of mass can be computed , as well as the shape of the probability distribution : we show that the pdf of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , has a non - analytic behavior ( essential singularity ) at @xmath73 ( which is shown to be a direct consequence of a phase transition of ` inifinite ' order in the associated coulomb gas problem ) .",
    "in addition , we find exact asymptotic results , to leading order for large @xmath0 , for the mean @xmath74 and the variance @xmath75 .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we present our model , compute ( via path integral method ) the joint probability distribution of the heights of the interfaces and compare it to the probability distribution of the eigenvalues of a wishart matrix . in section [ sec : statprop ] , we analyse some statistical properties of the model .",
    "we first present the results for the average density of lines ( subsection [ subsec : dens ] ) .",
    "we then compute the behavior of the maximal height ( [ subsec : max ] ) and the minimal height ( [ subsec : min ] ) .",
    "finally we study the distribution of the center of mass of the heights in ( [ subsec : cdm ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : ccl ] concludes the paper with a summary and outlook .",
    "our model consists of @xmath0 nonintersecting @xmath1-dimensional interfaces over a substrate of size @xmath42 ( that induces an external potential ) . for simplicity , we first present the model for a single interface in subsection [ 1 int ] and show how , using a path - integral formalism",
    ", one can map the problem of calculating the equilibrium height distribution of the interface to computing the spectral properties of a quantum hamiltonian . in particular",
    ", calculating the height distribution in the limit @xmath76 ( large system ) corresponds to calculating the ground state wavefunction of this quantum hamiltonian .",
    "then we present the interacting model for general @xmath0 interfaces in subsection [ n int ] and show how to generalize the path integral formalism to a _ many - body _ problem and subsequently compute the joint distribution of heights at equilibrium .",
    "in particular , for a large system , the joint distribution is shown to have the wishart form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wishart0 ] ) with parameters @xmath2 and @xmath62 where @xmath54 appears in the potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the case of one single interface ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the interface is described by its height @xmath78 for @xmath41 from @xmath79 to @xmath42 .",
    "when we think of the interface as a walker ( or brownian motion ) , the height @xmath52 plays the role of the position of the walker , while the coordinate @xmath41 along the substrate corresponds to time .",
    "the substrate can then be seen as a wall at height zero : one has @xmath80 for every @xmath41 . in the stationary state at thermal equilibrium",

    "the statistical weight of a configuration @xmath86 $ ] of the interface is thus simply ( setting @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath50 the temperature ) given by the boltzmann weight @xmath89   \\propto   \\exp \\big\\{-e \\big[\\{h(x)\\}\\big ] \\big\\}\\propto   \\exp\\left\\{-     \\frac{1}{2 }   \\int_0^l \\big ( \\frac{dh}{dx } \\big)^2 dx -    \\int_0^l   v\\left(h(x)\\right ) dx\\right\\ }   \\label{boltzmann}\\ ] ] we assume periodic boundary conditions : @xmath90 .    in absence of an external potential ( @xmath91 ) ,",
    "the interface is depinned , with a roughness exponent @xmath92 , which means @xmath93 . in this case",
    "the interface is just the trajectory of a free one dimensional brownian motion : the displacement @xmath52 of the walker grows as the square root of the ` time ' ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "but when the substrate induces an attractive potential , the interface remains pinned to the wall ( substrate ) .",
    "the interface then becomes smooth ( @xmath94 ) in this case .",
    "given the overall statistical weight of the _ full configuration _ of an interface in eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) over @xmath39 $ ] , our task next is to compute the ` marginal ' height distribution @xmath95 of the interface at a fixed point @xmath41 in space , by integrating out the heights at other points .",
    "note that due to the translational symmetry imposed by the periodic boundary condition , this marginal height distribution @xmath95 is independent of the point @xmath41 , which we can conveniently choose to be @xmath96 for example .",
    "this integration of all other heights except at @xmath79 ( or @xmath42 ) can be very conveniently carried out by the following path integral that allows us to write the marginal pdf @xmath95 as @xmath97 } \\,\\ , \\mathbb{1}_{h(x)>0 } \\label{ph0}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath98 is an indicator function that enforces the condition that the height at all points @xmath39 $ ] is positive and the energy @xmath99 $ ] is given in eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) .",
    "the path integral can be reinterpreted as a quantum propagator : @xmath100 with the hamiltonian @xmath101 and with the constraint @xmath102 .",
    "the problem is now the one of a quantum particle in one dimension with position @xmath78 at time @xmath41 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath103 ( in imaginary time ) .",
    "we assume now that the energy spectrum of @xmath103 is discrete ( this will be the case in presence of the confining potential ) .",
    "the propagator can be decomposed in the eigenbasis of @xmath103 : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the eigenfunction of energy @xmath106 .",
    "thus calculating the marginal height distribution is equivalent , thanks to the relation in eq .",
    "( [ marginal1 ] ) , to calculating the full spectral properties ( i.e. , all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ) of the quantum hamiltonian @xmath103 . in eq . and , the size @xmath42 of the substrate ( in the classical system of interfaces ) plays the role of the inverse temperature in the associated quantum problem ( but it has nothing to do with the temperature of the interfaces ) .",
