    "neutrino physics is a peculiar part of flavor physics , because neutrinos belong to _ super - light _ flavors in comparison with charged leptons and quarks .",
    "there are three central concepts in flavor physics : mass , flavor mixing and cp violation .",
    "* _ mass _ represents the inertial energy possessed by a particle when it exists at rest .",
    "a massless particle has no way to exist at rest - instead , it must always move at the speed of light . a massive fermion ( lepton or quark )",
    "must exist in both left - handed and right - handed states , because the field operators responsible for the nonzero mass of a fermion have to be bilinear products of the spinor fields which flip the fermion s handedness .",
    "* _ flavor mixing _ measures the mismatch between flavor eigenstates and mass eigenstates of leptons or quarks , caused by the higgs interactions .",
    "flavor eigenstates are the members of the weak isospin doublets that transform into each other via the interaction with @xmath0 bosons , while mass eigenstates are the states of definite masses created by the interaction with higgs bosons .",
    "if neutrinos were massless , lepton flavor mixing would not exist . *",
    "_ cp violation _ means that matter and antimatter or a reaction and its cp - conjugated process are distinguishable .",
    "it may manifest itself in the weak interactions through nontrivial complex phases residing in the flavor mixing matrix of leptons or quarks .",
    "if cpt is invariant , cp violation will give rise to t violation , or vice versa .",
    "the problems of fermion masses , flavor mixing and cp violation are correlated with one another and fundamentally important in particle physics .",
    "the study of these problems will ultimately help us understand the nature of matter and the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe . since the early 1960 s",
    ", a lot of experimental efforts have been made to measure the parameters of quark mixing and cp violation .",
    "the problem of lepton mixing and cp violation was not at the front of experimental particle physics for a long time , however , partly because neutrinos were assumed to be massless in the successful theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions  the standard electroweak model @xcite .",
    "this situation has dramatically changed since the compelling evidence in favor of atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations was achieved by super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite , sno @xcite , kamland @xcite and k2k @xcite collaborations in the past five years .",
    "neutrino oscillation is a quantum phenomenon which can naturally occur if neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed .",
    "thanks to the elegant sk , sno , kamland and k2k experiments , we are now convinced that the long - standing solar neutrino ( @xmath1 ) deficit and the atmospheric neutrino ( @xmath2 ) anomaly are both due to neutrino oscillations .",
    "the study of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing is therefore becoming one of the hottest fronts of today s particle physics and cosmology .",
    "our present knowledge on the properties of neutrinos comes not only from a number of neutrino oscillation experiments , but also from the direct - mass - search experiments , the neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and the astrophysical or cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "the following is a partial list of what we have known about neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing .",
    "* neutrinos are massive but their masses are tiny .",
    "the mass scale of three active neutrinos ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is expected to be at or below @xmath4 ev . * two independent mass - squared differences of three neutrinos , which are associated separately with solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , are very small and have a strong hierarchy . typically , @xmath5 and @xmath6 hold . * two lepton flavor mixing angles , which are related separately to solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations ,",
    "are much larger than the cabibbo angle of quark mixing ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "typically , @xmath8 and @xmath9 hold . * the other lepton flavor mixing angle , which is relevant to the chooz reactor experiment for neutrino oscillations @xcite , is very small and even vanishing .",
    "the generous upper bound of this angle is @xmath10 at present .",
    "it is obvious that the mass spectrum of neutrinos and the mixing pattern of lepton flavors are very different from those of quarks .",
    "however , there exist many open questions about massive neutrinos and lepton flavor mixing .",
    "for example ,    * are massive neutrinos dirac or majorana particles ? if massive neutrinos are dirac particles , they can be distinguished from their antiparticles . by definition ,",
    "a majorana neutrino is identical to its antiparticle .",
    "it is possible to identify the majorana nature of massive neutrinos through the observation of the neutrinoless double beta decay of some even - even nuclei , in which the total lepton number is not conserved .",
    "* how many neutrino species are there ?",
    "we have known that there are three species of active neutrinos ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , corresponding to three species of charged leptons .",
    "it remains unclear whether the light _ sterile _",
    "neutrinos , which have been assumed to interpret the controversial lsnd data @xcite on @xmath11 oscillations , are really existent or not .",
    "* why are neutrino masses so tiny ?",
    "the fact that the masses of neutrinos are considerably smaller than the masses of charged leptons or quarks is a big puzzle to particle physicists .",
    "although a lot of theoretical models about neutrino masses have been proposed at either low or high energy scales , none of them has proved to be very successful and conceivable . *",
    "what is the absolute scale of neutrino masses ?",
    "it is very important to know the absolute values of three neutrino masses , because they are fundamental parameters of flavor physics .",
    "the mass scale of neutrinos is likely to indicate the energy scale of new physics responsible for the generation of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing .",
    "unfortunately , we are only aware of the upper bounds of neutrino masses .",
    "* why are the mixing angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 so big ?",
    "the _ bi - large _ neutrino mixing pattern is also a mystery to many theorists , because it is `` anomalously '' different from the familiar _ tri - small _ quark mixing pattern .",
    "although the lepton flavor mixing angles are in general expected to relate to the mass spectra of charged leptons and neutrinos , their specific relations have not convincingly or model - independently been established . * how small is the mixing angle @xmath14 ?",
    "current experimental data yield an upper bound @xmath10 , but the possibility @xmath15 can not be excluded .",
    "the smallness of @xmath14 requires a good theoretical reason , so does the vanishing of @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 held , there would be no chance to observe leptonic cp or t violation in normal neutrino - neutrino and antineutrino - antineutrino oscillations .",
    "* is there leptonic cp violation ?",
    "a necessary condition for the existence of cp and t violation in normal neutrino oscillations is @xmath16 . as cp violation",
    "has been discovered in the quark sector , we feel that there is no reason why cp should be conserved in the lepton sector .",
    "it is very difficult to detect the effects of cp or t violation in any realistic neutrino oscillation experiments , however .",
    "* can the leptonic cp - violating phases be determined ? if lepton flavor mixing is correlated with cp violation , one has to determine the relevant cp - violating phases through various possible experiments .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay and long - baseline appearance neutrino oscillations are expected to be sensitive to the majorana- and dirac - like phases of cp violation , respectively .",
    "to implement such measurements remains a big challenge to experimentalists .",
    "of course , much more experimental and theoretical efforts are needed to make , in order to answer the important questions listed above .",
    "much more phenomenological attempts are also needed to make , so as to bridge the gap between experimental data and theoretical models .",
    "the purpose of this article is to give an overview of recent progress in the phenomenological study of neutrino masses , lepton flavor mixing and cp violation .",
    "we concentrate on the _ model - independent _ properties of massive neutrinos , although it is unavoidable to introduce two very attractive ans@xmath17tze in today s neutrino physics  the seesaw mechanism and the thermal leptogenesis scenario .",
    "the remaining parts of this article are organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a review of the neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "first of all , we make a short introduction to the dirac and majorana neutrino masses , and to the well - known seesaw mechanism",
    ". then current experimental constraints on neutrino masses , including those from the neutrinoless double beta decay , kinematic measurements , neutrino oscillations and cosmological observations , are briefly summarized .",
    "finally some comments are given on the strategies to construct the phenomenological textures of lepton mass matrices .",
    "in section 3 , the model - independent features of lepton flavor mixing are illustrated both in vacuum and in matter .",
    "we present a classification of various parametrizations of the @xmath18 lepton flavor mixing matrix , and highlight one of them which is particularly useful for the study of neutrino oscillations .",
    "a few concise sum rules for neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing in matter are derived .",
    "several constant mixing patterns of massive neutrinos are introduced .",
    "finally we point out the differences and similarities between the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing and that of quark flavor mixing .",
    "section 4 is devoted to leptonic cp and t violation .",
    "the rephasing invariants of cp violation and the unitarity triangles are described both in vacuum and in matter .",
    "a few salient features of cp and t violation in long - baseline neutrino oscillations are also discussed .",
    "we pay some special interest to the thermal leptogenesis scenario to interpret the observed baryon - antibaryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "finally we comment on the possible connection or disconnection between the leptonic cp - violating quantities at high and low energy scales .",
    "the conclusion and outlook are presented in section 5 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the main body of this article deals with neutrino masses , lepton flavor mixing and cp violation in the scheme of three lepton families . to be complete , the properties of flavor mixing between one sterile neutrino ( @xmath19 ) and three active neutrinos ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 )",
    "are discussed in appendix a.",
    "the standard model of electromagnetic and weak interactions is based on the gauge group @xmath20 @xcite . in this framework only the left - handed leptons ( and quarks ) , which transform as @xmath21 doublets , take part in the charged - current weak interactions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons and neutrinos , respectively .",
    "if @xmath25 were an exact symmetry , all leptons would be massless and their flavor eigenstates would be physically indistinguishable from their mass eigenstates . in reality , however , this gauge symmetry is badly broken . a spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath25 symmetry is realized in the standard model by means of the higgs mechanism .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , the charged leptons ( and quarks ) acquire their masses through the yukawa interactions : @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the charged lepton mass matrix and its scale is characterized by the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath28 gev .",
    "the vanishing of three neutrino masses follows as a straightforward consequence of the symmetry structure of the standard model , in which only a single higgs doublet exists and the lepton number conservation is assumed .",
    "symmetry that makes neutrinos exactly massless in the standard model , where @xmath29 denotes the baryon number and @xmath30 stands for the total lepton number .",
    "the reason is simply that a neutrino @xmath31 and an antineutrino @xmath32 have different values of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "thus the naive argument for massless neutrinos is valid to all orders in perturbation and non - perturbation theories , if @xmath33 is an exact symmetry . ]",
    "note that the mass eigenstates of charged leptons can always be chosen to coincide with their flavor eigenstates through an appropriate but physically - irrelevant unitary transformation of the right - handed fields .",
    "in such a specific flavor basis the coincidence between mass and flavor eigenstates of neutrinos can also be achieved , if neutrinos are assumed to be exactly massless weyl particles .",
    "hence there is no lepton flavor mixing within the framework of the standard electroweak model .",
    "however , the assumption of lepton number conservation or masslessness of neutrinos is not assured by any basic symmetry principle of particle physics .",
    "most reasonable extensions of the standard model ( such as the grand unified theories ) do allow the absence of lepton number conservation and the existence of nonvanishing neutrino masses .",
    "if neutrinos are really massive and their masses are non - degenerate , it will in general be impossible to find a basis of the flavor space in which the coincidence between flavor and mass eigenstates holds both for charged leptons and for neutrinos .",
    "in other words , the flavor mixing phenomenon is naturally expected to appear between three charged leptons and three massive neutrinos , just like the flavor mixing between three up - type quarks and three down - type quarks @xcite .",
    "if neutrinos have nonzero masses , they may be either dirac or majorana particles .",
    "the field of a massive dirac neutrino describes four independent states : left - handed and right - handed particle states ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) as well as left - handed and right - handed antiparticle states ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) . among them",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath37 states , which already exist in the standard model , can take part in weak interactions .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 states need to be introduced into the standard model as necessary ingredients to give the dirac neutrino a mass , but they should be `` sterile '' in the sense that they do not take part in the normal weak interactions . a dirac mass term , which conserves the total lepton number but violates the law of individual lepton flavor conservation , can be written as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the @xmath18 dirac neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the mass term in ( 2.3 ) is quite similar to the mass term of charged leptons in ( 2.2 ) , hence the scale of @xmath39 should also be characterized by the gauge symmetry breaking scale @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the yukawa coupling constants of three neutrinos must be extremely smaller than those of three charged leptons or six quarks , such that tiny neutrino masses can result .",
    "this dramatic difference between the yukawa couplings of neutrinos and charged leptons ( or quarks ) is commonly considered to be very unnatural in a sound theory of fermion mass generation , however .    on the other hand , the neutrino @xmath31 may be a majorana particle , which has only two independent states of the same mass ( @xmath34 and @xmath37 , or @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . by definition ,",
    "a majorana neutrino is its own antiparticle : @xmath41 @xcite , where @xmath42 denotes the charge - conjugation operator and @xmath43 is an arbitrary real phase . a majorana mass term , which violates both the law of total lepton number conservation and that of individual lepton flavor conservation , can be written either as @xmath44 or as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the symmetric @xmath18 mass matrices of left - handed and right - handed majorana neutrinos , respectively .",
    "note that the mass term @xmath48 can not naturally arise from a simple theory of electroweak interactions which is invariant under the @xmath49 gauge transformation and has no @xmath50 triplet field ( like the case in the standard model ) .",
    "it is possible to incorporate the mass term @xmath51 into an electroweak theory with @xmath49 gauge symmetry , because right - handed neutrinos are @xmath50 singlets . in general",
    ", a neutrino mass lagrangian may include all of the above - mentioned terms : @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath51 , in which @xmath39 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are complex mass matrices .",
    "a variety of specific theoretical and phenomenological models have been prescribed in the literature to interpret how lepton masses are generated and why neutrino masses are so tiny .",
    "regardless of the energy scales at which those models are built , the mechanisms responsible for fermion mass generation and flavor mixing can roughly be classified into five different categories @xcite : ( a ) radiative mechanisms @xcite ; ( b ) texture zeros @xcite ; ( c ) family symmetries @xcite ; ( d ) seesaw mechanisms @xcite ; and ( e ) extra dimensions @xcite . among them , the seesaw mechanisms are particularly natural and interesting . a brief introduction to the seesaw idea will be presented in section 2.1.2 . for recent reviews of other interesting models and ans@xmath17tze on neutrino masses ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .",
    "a simple extension of the standard model is to include one right - handed neutrino in each of three lepton families , while the lagrangian of electroweak interactions keeps invariant under the @xmath49 gauge transformation .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the resultant lepton mass term @xmath53 consists of @xmath54 ( charged lepton term ) , @xmath52 ( dirac neutrino term ) and @xmath51 ( righ - handed majorana neutrino term ) , which have been given in ( 2.2 ) , ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.5 ) . to be explicit , we have @xmath55 where @xmath31 denotes the column vector of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 fields ; i.e. , @xmath56 or @xmath57 . in obtaining ( 2.6 )",
    ", we have used the relation @xmath58 as well as the properties of @xmath31 and @xmath59 .",
    "as pointed out in section 2.1.1 , the scale of @xmath39 is characterized by the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath40 .",
    "the scale of @xmath47 can naturally be much higher than @xmath40 , because right - handed neutrinos are @xmath50 singlets and their corresponding mass term is not subject to the scale of gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "it has commonly been expected that the scale of @xmath47 is not far away from the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath60 gev . in this case , the smallness of left - handed neutrino masses ( @xmath61 for @xmath62 ) is essentially attributed to the largeness of right - handed neutrino masses ( @xmath63 for @xmath62 ) .",
    "such an elegant idea , the so - called seesaw mechanism , was first proposed by yanagida and by gell - mann , ramond and slansky in 1979 @xcite .",
    "2.1 illustrates the seesaw mass term given in ( 2.6 ) .    to show how the seesaw mechanism works , we diagonalize the symmetric @xmath64 neutrino mass matrix in ( 2.6 ) by use of the following unitary transformation : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the @xmath18 matrices ; @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the @xmath18 diagonal mass matrices with eigenvalues @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( for @xmath62 ) , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that both @xmath66 and @xmath67 in ( 2.7 ) are expected to be of order @xmath77 , as a result of the huge hierarchy between the scales of @xmath39 and @xmath47 .",
    "hence @xmath78 and @xmath79 are excellent approximations for ( 2.8 ) .",
    "we then arrive at @xmath80 for the heavy ( right - handed ) neutrino mass matrix and the well - known seesaw formula for the light ( left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix , .",
    "for instance , @xmath81 with @xmath82 holds . ]",
    "@xmath83 the seesaw mechanism was actually motivated by the so(10 ) guts @xcite , which include right - handed neutrinos automatically together with other charged fermions in irreducible * 16 * -dimensional multiplets .",
    "in such an attractive framework , @xmath39 can simply be related to the up - type quark mass matrix @xmath84 , whose possible textures have well been restricted by current experimental data @xcite .",
    "if both @xmath39 ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath47 were assumed to be diagonal , @xmath86 would also be diagonal and its three mass eigenvalues would be @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in this illustrative case ,",
    "@xmath90 ev may simply result from @xmath91 gev , a scale not far away from the gut scale @xmath92 .    without loss of generality , both the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath27 and the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath47",
    "can be arranged to be diagonal and have positive mass eigenvalues . in this specific flavor basis , the approximately unitary matrix @xmath69 in ( 2.9 ) links the mass eigenstates of light neutrinos to their flavor eigenstates ; i.e. , it is relevant to the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing at low energies ( see section 3.1 for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "a full parametrization of @xmath69 requires three mixing angles and three cp - violating phases .",
    "thus @xmath86 consists of nine free parameters .",
    "note that the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath39 can be parametrized as @xmath93 @xcite , in which @xmath94 is a complex orthogonal matrix containing three rotation angles and three phase angles .",
    "it seems that @xmath39 in this parametrization consists of eighteen parameters : six from @xmath69 , three from @xmath70 , six from @xmath94 and three from @xmath47 .",
    "however , only fifteen of them ( nine real parameters and six cp - violating phases ) are independent , due to the seesaw relation . we conclude that the lepton mass matrices @xmath27 , @xmath39 and @xmath47 totally have twenty - one free parameters : three from @xmath27 , fifteen from @xmath39 and three from @xmath47 in the chosen flavor basis .",
    "it is worth mentioning that ( 2.9 ) has been referred to as the type - i seesaw formula .",
    "a somehow similar relation , the so - called type - ii seesaw formula @xcite , can be derived from the generalized lepton mass term @xmath95 where @xmath46 has been defined in ( 2.4 ) .",
    "as @xmath46 must result from a new yukawa - interaction term which violates the @xmath49 gauge symmetry in the standard model , its scale might be much lower than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath40 .",
    "the strong hierarchy between the scales of @xmath47 and @xmath46 or @xmath39 allow us to make some safe approximations in diagonalizing the @xmath64 neutrino mass matrix in ( 2.10 ) .",
    "we find that the heavy ( right - handed ) neutrino mass matrix remains to take the form @xmath80 .",
    "in contrast , the light ( left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath96 this result is just the type - ii seesaw formula . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the type - ii seesaw relation is a reflection of the left - right symmetry of the theory at high energies . for the phenomenological study of neutrino masses , however , the type - i seesaw mechanism is more popular and useful because it involves fewer free parameters than the type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "of course , there are some other versions of the seesaw mechanism , which are either more complicated @xcite or simpler @xcite than what we have discussed above . while the seesaw idea is qualitatively elegant to interpret the smallness of left - handed neutrino masses , it can not lead to quantitative predictions unless specific textures of neutrino mass matrices ( e.g. , @xmath39 and @xmath47 ) are assumed .",
    "many interesting ans@xmath17tze of lepton mass matrices have so far been proposed and incorporated with the seesaw mechanism ( for recent reviews with extensive references , see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) , but they are strongly model - dependent and thus beyond the scope of the present review article .",
    "neutrino oscillation is a quantum phenomenon which can naturally happen if neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed . in a simple two - neutrino mixing scheme , the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath97 and @xmath98 are linear combinations of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite : @xmath101 and @xmath102 , where @xmath103 denotes the flavor mixing angle",
    ". then the probabilities of neutrino oscillations are governed by two characteristic parameters : one of them is the neutrino mass - squared difference @xmath104 and the other is the flavor mixing factor @xmath105 .",
    "corresponding to the `` disappearance '' and `` appearance '' neutrino experiments , the survival and conversion probabilities of a neutrino flavor eigenstate @xmath97 can explicitly be expressed as @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 is the neutrino beam energy ( in unit of gev ) , and @xmath30 denotes the distance between the neutrino source and the neutrino detector ( in unit of km ) .",
    "a lot of experimental data , including those from solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrino oscillation experiments , have been analyzed by use of ( 2.12 ) .",
    "\\(1 ) the first model - independent evidence for neutrino oscillations was obtained from the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment @xcite on atmospheric neutrinos , which are produced in the earth s atmosphere by cosmic rays and are detected in an underground detector .",
    "if there were no neutrino oscillation , the atmospheric neutrinos entering and exiting the detector should have a spherical symmetry .",
    "in other words , the downward - going and upward - going neutrino fluxes should be equal to each other : @xmath109 versus the zenith angle @xmath110 ( for @xmath111 or @xmath112 ) .",
    "the sk collaboration has observed an approximate up - down flux symmetry for the atmospheric @xmath1 neutrinos and a significant up - down flux asymmetry for the atmospheric @xmath2 neutrinos .",
    "for instance , @xmath113 was measured for the multi - gev @xmath2 neutrinos , and it is in conflict with the up - down flux symmetry .",
    "this result can well be interpreted in the assumption of @xmath114 neutrino oscillations .",
    "current sk @xcite and chooz @xcite data have ruled out the possibility that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is dominantly attributed to @xmath115 or @xmath116 oscillations , where @xmath19 stands for a `` sterile '' neutrino which does not take part in the normal electroweak interactions ( see appendix a for detailed discussions ) .",
    "the hypothesis of atmospheric neutrino oscillations has recently received very strong support from the k2k @xcite long - baseline neutrino experiment , in which the @xmath2 beam is produced at the kek accelerator and measured 250 km away at the sk detector .",
    "the k2k collaboration observed a reduction of the @xmath2 flux and a distortion of the @xmath2 energy spectrum , which must take place in the presence of @xmath114 oscillations .",
    "the possibility that the k2k result is due to a statistical fluctuation instead of neutrino oscillations is found to be less than @xmath117 @xcite .",

    "\\(2 ) the long - standing problem associated with solar neutrinos is that the flux of solar @xmath1 neutrinos measured in all experiments ( e.g. , the sk @xcite and sno @xcite experiments as well as the earlier homestake @xcite , gallex - gno @xcite and sage @xcite experiments ) is significantly smaller than that predicted by the standard solar models @xcite .",
    "the deficit of solar @xmath1 s is not the same in different experiments , implying that the relevant physical effect is energy - dependent .",

    "the flavor conversion of solar @xmath1 neutrinos is most likely due to neutrino oscillations . in the scheme of two - neutrino oscillations ,",
    "a global analysis of all available experimental data on solar neutrinos ( in particular , those from the sk and sno measurements ) leads to several regions allowed for the parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 : the sma ( small mixing angle ) , lma ( large mixing angle ) and low ( low mass - squared difference ) regions based on the mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism @xcite as well as the vo ( vacuum oscillation ) and other possible regions @xcite , among which the lma region is most favored . recently the lma solution has been singled out as the only acceptable solution to the solar neutrino problem , thanks to the kamland @xcite experiment .",

    "once again , the formulas obtained above are valid only for neutrinos propagating in vacuum and in matter .",
    "they will become valid for antineutrinos , if the straightforward replacements @xmath354 and @xmath355 are made .",
    "we remark that the effective cp - violating parameter @xmath528 depends not only upon the fundamental cp - violating parameter of the lepton flavor mixing matrix ( @xmath527 ) , but also upon the mass - squared differences of neutrinos ( @xmath298 and @xmath339 ) and the matter - induced effect ( @xmath340 ) .",
    "in particular , both the sign and the magnitude of @xmath528 are dependent on the signs of @xmath298 and @xmath339 . with the help of ( 3.37 ) and ( 3.38 ) , we find that the effective mass - squared differences @xmath548 and @xmath549 can keep unchanged in proper arrangements of the signs of @xmath298 , @xmath339 and @xmath340 . a careful analysis of ( 4.4 ) leads to the following exact relations @xcite : @xmath550 the validity of these relations are independent of both the neutrino beam energy and the baseline length .",
    "note that current experimental data on solar neutrino oscillations favor @xmath551 , but the sign of @xmath339 remains unknown .",
    "it is also worth remarking that the cp- and t - violating effects are measured by the same parameter ( @xmath527 in vacuum or @xmath528 in matter ) , as a straightforward consequence of cpt invariance . as for neutrino oscillations ,",
    "a signal of cp violation comes from the probability asymmetry between @xmath552 and @xmath553 transitions ; while a signal of t violation is attributed to the probability asymmetry between @xmath552 and @xmath554 transitions or between @xmath553 and @xmath555 transitions ( @xmath388 ) .",
    "the former is roughly associated with the difference between @xmath556 and @xmath557 , in which the @xmath340-induced effects essentially add each other ; but the latter is roughly associated with the difference between @xmath556 and @xmath558 or between @xmath559 and @xmath557 , in which the @xmath340-induced effects essentially cancel each other . for this reason , the cp - violating asymmetries in long - baseline neutrino oscillations are rather sensitive to the terrestrial matter effect ; while the t - violating asymmetries are almost independent of the terrestrial matter effect ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions ) .",
    "measuring t violation is practically more difficult than measuring cp violation , however @xcite .    to illustrate the dependence of @xmath536 on matter effects , we typically take @xmath358 and @xmath359 as well as @xmath360 , @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath363 in the standard parametrization of @xmath69 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "4.1 , where @xmath451 has been chosen for the matter parameter @xmath340 .",
    "one can see that the magnitude of @xmath536 decreases , when the matter effect becomes significant ( e.g. , @xmath560 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this feature does not necessarily imply that the cp - violating asymmetries in realistic long - baseline neutrino oscillations would be smaller than their values in vacuum .",
    "very large terrestrial matter effects can significantly modify the frequencies of neutrino oscillations and thus enhance ( or suppress ) the genuine signals of cp violation .",
    "a geometric description of the lepton flavor mixing phenomenon is physically intuitive and instructive .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath18 flavor mixing matrix @xmath69 in vacuum can be expressed by two sets of orthogonality relations and two sets of normalization conditions for its nine matrix elements : @xmath561 where greek and latin indices run over @xmath23 and @xmath345 , respectively . in the complex plane the six orthogonality relations in ( 4.8 )",

    "4.2 , the so - called unitarity triangles . in general , these six triangles have eighteen different sides and nine different inner ( or outer ) angles .",
    "the unitarity requires that all six triangles have the same area amounting to @xmath564 , where @xmath527 is just the rephasing - invariant measure of cp violation defined in ( 4.1 ) .",
    "if cp were an exact symmetry , @xmath565 would hold and those unitarity triangles would collapse into lines in the complex plane . note that the shape and area of each unitarity triangle are irrelevant to the nature of neutrinos ; i.e. , they are the same for dirac and majorana neutrinos .    in additon to @xmath527 ,",
    "there exist other two characteristic quantities of @xmath69 , resulting from its normalization conditions in ( 4.8 ) .",
    "they are the off - diagonal asymmetries @xmath566 and @xmath482 defined in ( 3.60 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath567 ( or @xmath483 ) would imply that the flavor mixing matrix @xmath69 were symmetric about its @xmath568-@xmath485-@xmath569 ( or @xmath309-@xmath485-@xmath486 ) axis .",
    "geometrically this would correspond to the congruence between two unitarity triangles ; i.e. , @xmath570 our current knowledge on lepton flavor mixing is rather poor , hence it remains difficult to quantify the magnitude of leptonic cp violation .",

    "provided the baseline satisfies the condition @xmath584 ( i.e. , @xmath585 ) , the cp - conserving quantities @xmath586 and the cp - violating parameter @xmath527 could both be determined from ( 4.11 ) for changing values of the neutrino beam energy @xmath108 .",
    "then one may get @xmath587 in practice , the earth - induced matter effects are likely to fake the genuine cp - violating signals and have to be taken into account .",
    "if the neutrino beam energy is low enough ( e.g. , @xmath588 to 1 gev ) and the baseline length is not too long ( e.g. , @xmath589 km ) , the terrestrial matter effects might not be very significant for our purpose @xcite .",

    "the same results are also applicable for the discussion of cp and t violation in the four - quark mixing models @xcite .",
    "note that all cp- and t - violating observables in neutrino oscillations must be related linearly to @xmath696 . to see this point more clearly",
    ", we consider that a neutrino @xmath97 converts to another neutrino @xmath98 in vacuum .",

    "cpt invariance assures that the transition probabilities @xmath704 and @xmath705 are identical , and they can directly be read off from ( a.11 ) through the replacement @xmath706 ( i.e. , @xmath354 ) .",
    "thus the cp - violating asymmetry between @xmath707 and @xmath705 is equal to the t - violating asymmetry between @xmath707 and @xmath704 .",
    "the latter can be explicitly and compactly expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath708 equivalently , one may obtain @xmath709 or @xmath710 in getting eqs .",
    "( a.12)(a.14 ) , the equality @xmath711 and ( a.6 ) have been used .",
    "only three of the twelve asymmetries @xmath712 are independent , and they probe three of the six cp - violating phases ( or their combinations ) of @xmath69 . since only the transitions between active neutrinos can in practice be measured , the useful probability asymmetries for the study of leptonic cp and t violation in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are @xmath713 , @xmath714 and @xmath715 .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath69 implies that there exist twelve orthogonality relations and eight normalization conditions among its sixteen matrix elements .",
    "the former corresponds to twelve quadrangles in the complex plane , the so - called unitarity quadrangles . to be explicit ,",

    "note , however , that each quadrangle has three distinct topologies in the complex plane . for illustration , we take quadrangle @xmath718 for example and show its three topologies in fig .",
    "a.2 , where the sizes and phases of @xmath719 ( for @xmath666 ) have been fixed .",
    "one can see that different topologies of quadrangle @xmath718 arise from different orderings of its four sides , and their areas are apparently different from one another . as a whole , there are totally thirty - six different topologies among twelve unitarity quadrangles .",

    "in particular , the algebraic area of unitarity quadrangle @xmath718 in the case of topology ( b ) means an algebraic sum of the areas of its two disassociated triangles , which have opposite signs .",
    "hence both @xmath722 and @xmath723 are in general allowed .",
