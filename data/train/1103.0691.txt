    "the behaviour of a material medium in response to electromagnetic and gravitational fields encompasses a vast range of classical and quantum physics . for media composed of a large collection of molecular or ionized structures recourse to a statistical description",
    "is required and this often leads to a coarser description in terms of a few thermodynamic variables and their correlations .",
    "such a description relies on the efficacy of particular constitutive models or phenomenological constitutive data that serve to circumscribe its domain of applicability .    for phenomena where the relative motions of the constituents approach the speed of light in vacuo or",
    "the material experiences bulk accelerations or gravitational interactions such constitutive descriptions must be formulated within a relativistic framework .",
    "however even within a spacetime covariant formulation there remains great freedom in how to accommodate electromagnetic responses that depend on material dispersion induced by spatial correlations or temporal delays of electromagnetic interactions@xcite .",
    "the incorporation of such effects in a theoretical description often relies on a detailed structural model of the medium particularly if it is inhomogeneous or external gravitational gradients are relevant . notwithstanding",
    "these complexities simple constitutive models have proved of considerable value for homogeneous polarizable media that exhibit temporal dispersion in a laboratory frame where gravity plays no essential role . indeed",
    "the notion of permittivity and permeability tensors is often adequate to parametrize a large range of experimental linear responses of simple polarizable media to external static and dynamic electromagnetic fields .",
    "more generally , for non - dispersive media these tensors can be subsumed into a _ susceptibility kernel _ that readily accommodates special relativistic effects on the bulk motion of media .    in this article the degree",
    "to which the notion of a _ susceptibility kernel _ can be generalized to describe linear electromagnetic responses of dispersive continuous media is explored .",
    "in particular the effects of spatial material inhomogeneity and non - stationarity will be formulated within a fully covariant spacetime framework . in this manner",
    "the formulation can accommodate arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the framework will be illustrated by re - casting the maxwell - vlasov equations for a collisionless plasma in a form that exposes a 2-point electromagnetic susceptibility kernel in an arbitrary external gravitational field .",
    "this permits the establishment of a perturbative scheme for non - stationary inhomogeneous plasma configurations in terms of such a kernel .",
    "explicit formulae for the perturbed kernel are derived in both the presence and absence of gravitation in terms of the general solution to the equations of motion of the plasma constituents . in the absence of gravitation",
    "this permits an analysis of collisionless damping in terms of a system of integral equations that reduce to standard landau damping of langmuir modes when the perturbation refers to a homogeneous stationary plasma configuration .",
    "it is concluded that constitutive modelling in terms of a 2-point susceptibility kernel in a covariant spacetime framework offers a natural extension of standard non - relativistic descriptions of simple media and that its use for describing linear responses of more general dispersive media has wide applicability in relativistic plasma modelling .",
