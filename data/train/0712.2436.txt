    "this is the fourth in a series of papers on a comparative direct analysis of the optical spectra of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "paper  i ( branch et  al .",
    "2005 ) was concerned with a time series of spectra of the spectroscopically normal sn  1994d , paper  ii ( branch et  al .",
    "2006 ) was devoted to spectra obtained near maximum light , and paper  iii ( branch et  al .",
    "2007 ) concentrated on premaximum spectra .",
    "this paper is about postmaximum spectra , which form in the deeper , lower velocity ejecta .    in paper",
    "ii we divided the maximum - light ( @xmath6 maximum ) spectra into four groups : core normal , broad line , cool , and shallow silicon ( denoted cn , bl , cl , and ss , respectively , in this paper ) . the group assignments were made on the basis of measurements of the ( pseudo ) equivalent widths of absorption features near 5750 and 6100 , as well as on the appearance ( depth , width , and shape ) of the 6100absorption , which is produced by the si  ii 6355 transition .",
    "although we framed the presentation and discussion in terms of the four groups , in the end we concluded that for the most part the spectra appeared to have a continuous distribution of properties , rather than consisting of discrete subtypes ( the extreme ss sn  2002cx  likes being an apparent exception , and the extreme cl sn  1991bg  likes being a possible exception ) . in paper  iii we found that to a large extent the premaximum spectra exhibited the defining characteristics of the four groups .    in this paper ,",
    "as in the previous ones , we confine our attention to optical spectra , from the ca  ii h and k feature in the blue ( @xmath7 ) to the ca  ii infrared triplet ( ca  ii ir3 ) in the red ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "all spectra have been corrected for the redshifts of the host galaxies , and mild smoothing has been applied to some of the spectra .",
    "all spectra have been flattened according to the local normalization procedure of jeffery et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which eliminates all significant broad band continuum variations , including those caused by interstellar reddening and observational error .",
    "thus the locally normalized spectra allow valid comparisons of intrinsic line features . but note that a locally normalized spectrum is not a unique representation of the line spectrum .",
    "it depends on the exact prescription of the local normalization procedure .",
    "we use exactly the same procedure for all spectra of this paper .",
    "we examined all of the sn  ia postmaximum spectra available to us and selected three samples : a `` 1 week postmax '' sample , consisting of one spectrum each of 21 sne  ia observed between day  + 6 and day  + 8 with respect to the time of maximum brightness in the @xmath6 band ; a `` 3 week postmax '' sample of 19 sne  ia observed between day  + 19 and day  + 23 ; and a `` 3 months postmax '' sample of 15 sne  ia observed between day  + 81 and day  + 98 ( an interval of day  + 80 to day  + 100 yielded no additional spectra ) .",
    "the sne  ia and the epochs of the selected spectra are listed in table  1 .",
    "many comparisons of subsets of these spectra have appeared in the literature .",
    "our goal is to provide a more systematic and comprehensive comparison .",
    "spectra of four of the sne  ia of table  1 were not available for previous papers of this series .",
    "sadakane et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) published spectra of sn  1995d obtained shortly after maximum light , but it is difficult to decide from their figure  3 whether sn  1995d should be assigned to the cns or the sss .",
    "on the basis of the report by benetti & mendes de oliveira ( 1995 ) that in a 1 week premax spectrum the 5750    absorption was unusually weak if present at all , we tentatively assign sn  1995d to the ss group .",
    "pastorello et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) referred to sn  2004eo as a transitional sn  ia because its properties placed it between the three groups ( faint , low velocity gradient , and high velocity gradient ) of benetti et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in our classification",
    ", the maximum light spectrum of sn  2004eo is not quite cn ; it resembles that of sn  1989b ( paper  ii ) , and like sn  1989b it is placed in the cl group although it does not contain the blue `` ti  ii trough '' of the more extreme members of the cl group .",
    "the maximum light spectrum of sn  2006x ( wang et  al .",
    "2007 ) is that of an extreme bl sn  ia , such as sn  1984a .",
    "hicken et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that an early spectrum of sn  2006gz had the strongest c  ii 6580  absorption yet seen in a sn  ia , and argued that super ",
    "chandrasekhar mass ejection is required .",
    "although no spectrum was obtained within three days of maximum light , at earlier epochs sn  2006gz showed characteristics of a ss event , and we tentatively classify it as such .",
    "continuing our attempt to provide an internally consistent quantification of sn  ia spectra , we have used the parameterized resonance  scattering synthetic  spectrum code , synow , to fit the spectra of table  1 .",
    "the excitation temperature is fixed at a nominal value of 7000  k , as was done for the postmaximum sn  1994d spectra of paper  i. a change of procedure from our previous work with synow on postmaximum spectra , including that of paper  i , is that instead of using exponential ( paper  i ) or power ",
    "law radial optical depth distributions , we use a flat distribution with an imposed maximum velocity , @xmath9 , for every ion . in the outer layers of the ejected matter",
    ", a decreasing density is dictated by hydrodynamical models ( and by mass conservation : the density must start decreasing somewhere ) , but in the deeper layers the density gradient is less steep .",
    "since the optical depth distribution depends also on composition , excitation , and ionization gradients , a flat optical depth distribution is not unreasonable . for further economy of parameters , for a given spectrum",
    "we use the same value of @xmath10 for all singly ionized members of the iron group , from sc  ii to ni  ii ( with the exception of the 1 week postmax spectrum of sn  2000cx ;   3 . )",
    "the price to be paid is that the fits are not optimized , but the fitting procedure becomes more efficient ( there is no need to vary the @xmath11 parameter ) and the parameters become easier to compare : for each ion we have just a reference  line optical depth and the velocity interval in which the lines of the ion are forming in the synthetic spectrum , the minimum velocity being either the velocity at the photosphere @xmath12 or a higher detachment velocity ( i.e. , detached from the photosphere ) .",
    "since we use only one optical depth component for each ion , in this paper it is not necessary to use the hv ( high velocity ) and pv ( photospheric velocity ) terminology of previous papers of this series .",
    "consider the effects , when switching from an exponential to a flat optical depth distribution , on the relative importance of lines of the same ion but of different strengths . in the flat case ,",
    "the optical depths of the strongest lines need to be smaller than in the exponential case , since they maintain the same optical depths all the way to @xmath9 .",
    "lines that are somewhat weaker , but whose optical depths still remain above unity in the flat case , become relatively more important , because they now form over just as large a velocity interval as the strongest lines .",
    "lines whose optical depths are reduced from above unity in the exponential case to well below unity in the flat case no longer conspicuously affect the spectrum .    as an example , figure  1 compares synthetic spectra for fe  ii , with flat and exponential optical depth distributions .",
    "the flat case has the parameters that we use in   4 for the day  + 22 spectrum of the cn sn  1996x : @xmath13(fe  ii)=12 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the exponential case has the parameters that we used in paper  i for the day  + 24 spectrum of the cn sn  1994d : @xmath13(fe  ii)=200 , @xmath16 , and exponential @xmath17folding velocity @xmath18 .",
    "note that the flat case requires a lower value of @xmath12 than the exponential case . while the two synthetic spectra are similar",
    ", there are some significant differences , such as the near disappearance in the flat case of the absorption that appears near 5380    in the exponential case , and the higher flux peak near 4660    in the flat case .",
    "one week postmax is in the middle of what we referred to in paper  i as the postmaximum `` si  ii phase '' ( from two to 12 days past maximum , for sn  1994d ) , because the 6100    absorption is deep and apparently unblended , at least in its core . at 1 week",
    "postmax the spectra are not radically different from at maximum light .",
    "figure  2 shows the 1 week postmax spectra of the cns .",
    "the spectra are very similar .",
    "a log plot such as figure  2 is convenient for comparing multiple spectra at once , but since the spectra are displaced from each other , it can be difficult to appreciate the degree of the homogeneity .",
    "figure  3 directly compares the spectra of sn  1998bu and sn  1996x , to show how strikingly similar these two spectra are .",
    "even the difference at the red end of the sn  1998bu spectrum is not necessarily real , because observed spectra sometimes have problems at their ends , and also because the local normalization technique can mildly warp the ends of the spectra ( jeffery et  al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "an example synow fit is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the fit is to the spectrum of the cn sn  1996x ( selected because it is the best spectrum of figure  2 , not because it is the best fit ) .",
    "the fitting parameters for sn  1996x ( and other selected spectra of figure  2 ) are in table  2 .",
    "apart from the flat optical depth distribution , the fit of figure  4 is a conventional one .",
    "the ions are the same as were used for the 1 week postmax spectrum of sn  1994d in paper  i , except that here cr  ii also is included .",
    "lines of o  i , si  ii , s  ii , ca  ii , and fe  ii produce most of the features in the synthetic spectrum , and we are confident that these ions are present in the observed spectrum .",
    "the presence in the observed spectrum of na  i , mg  ii , cr  ii , fe  iii , and co  ii is not definite , but we use them in the synthetic spectrum because they are plausible and they improve the fit .",
    "the three main discrepancies in figure  4 are familiar problems with synow fits .",
    "first , for ca  ii we choose parameters to fit the observed ir3 feature , because it is less blended and more sensitive to optical depth than the h and k feature ; in this case , this causes the synthetic h and k absorption to be too strong .",
    "second , the flux minimum from about 6900 to 7100    has no counterpart in the synthetic spectrum . the only identification that we can suggest is [ o  ii ] 7320,7330 , which was discussed in the context of sn  1991 t by fisher et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and of the type  ic sn  1994i by millard et  al .",
    "however , at later epochs this discrepancy becomes stronger , and invoking [ o  ii ] to solve it would imply excessive mass and kinetic energy of oxygen ( at least for an exploding white dwarf ) .",
    "more likely , what we are seeing in figure  4 is an early , mild manifestation of a discrepancy that is due to our simplifying assumption of resonant scattering .",
    "third , the synthetic spectrum lacks absorption from about 7600 to 7800   .",
    "the observed absorption in this region presumably is due to mg  ii 7890 , blended with o  i 7772 , but in synow spectra the synthetic absorption usually is too blue , even when mg  ii is undetached , as it is here .",
    "most of the spectra of figure  2 are so similar that it is not worth reporting fitting parameters for every spectrum .",
    "the exception is sn  2004s , which has much stronger high velocity ca  ii absorption than the others .",
    "krisciunas et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) termed sn  2004s a clone of sn  2001el , another cn with exceptionally strong high velocity ca  ii features ( wang et  al .",
    "2003 ; kasen et  al . 2003 ; mattila et  al . 2005 ; paper  ii ) .",
    "krisciunas et  al . noted that at maximum light sn  2004s had an unusually low si  ii absorption blueshift for a spectrum containing the usual sn  ia features , and that the blueshift decreased more rapidly than in sn  2001el .",
    "we find that at 1 week postmax , all absorptions other than those of ca  ii are less blueshifted than in the other spectra of figure  2 ; consequently our fit for sn  2004s has a low value of @xmath19  ( table  2 ) , instead of 11,000  as used for the others of figure  2 .",
    "figure  5 shows the 1 week postmax spectra of the bls ( plus the spectrum of the cn sn  1996x for comparison ) . at this epoch the spectrum of sn  2002er is like that of a cn .",
    "sn  1992a retains some of its bl characteristics and remains mildly different from cn .",
    "the spectra of sn  2002bf , sn  2006x , and sn  1984a are obviously different from cn , but similar to each other .",
    "their 6100    absorptions are deeper , broader , and more blueshifted , and they have deep absorptions from about 4700 to 5100   .",
    "a fit to sn  2002bf is shown in figure  6 .",
    "the 6100    absorption and the deep absorption from 4700 to 5100    are matched by using a high @xmath9 of 21,000 for si  ii and fe  ii , compared to a typical value of 15,000  for the cns at 1 week postmax .",
    "the fe  ii features of sn  2005bf are so prominent that it is difficult to determine whether lines of mg  ii , fe  iii , and co  ii are present .",
    "the 1 week postmax spectra of the cls are shown in figure  7 . at this epoch sn",
    "1989b is like that of a cn and sn  2004eo is only mildly different .",
    "the spectrum of the extreme cl sn  1999by , a sn  1991bg  like ( garnavich et  al .",
    "2004 ) , is more highly evolved than the others of the 1 week postmax sample , in fact it has more in common with the 3 week postmax spectra of the cns than with their 1 week postmax spectra .",
    "a fit for sn  1999by is shown in figure  8 .",
    "the presence of si  ii , ca  ii , ti  ii , and fe  ii is definite , while mg  i , sc  ii , and cr  ii are plausible and improve the fit .",
    "there are three main discrepancies .",
    "first , the synthetic absorption near 5340   , produced by cr  ii , is not deep enough , even though cr  ii is too strong in several other places .",
    "( a corresponding feature in the cns of the 3 week postmax sample is discussed in   4 . )",
    "second , the observed absorption near 5820    has practically no counterpart in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the only identification we can offer is si  ii 5972 , but it hardly appears in the synthetic spectrum even though the absorption feature of the 6355 si  ii reference line is too strong .",
    "third , the synthetic flux peaks near 4000 and 4600    are too high ; this may be a consequence of the flat optical depth distribution ( see the 4600    peak in figure  1 . )",
    "our present synow fit differs from the one presented in garnavich et  al . in",
    "that we do not use ca  i , ti  ii makes no significant contribution to the synthetic spectrum at wavelengths longer than 5300   , and we do invoke mg  i , sc  ii , and cr  ii .    figure  9 shows the 1 week postmax spectra of the sss . sn",
    "2006gz is intermediate between the cn sn  1996x and the ss sn  1999aa , which has weaker si  ii , s  ii , and ca  ii absorptions .",
    "hicken et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) identified c  ii in spectra of sn  2006gz obtained 10 or more days before maximum light , after which the feature was not identifiable , consistent with the lack of evidence for c  ii in the spectrum shown in figure  9 .",
    "the direct comparison of sn  1999ac and sn  1996x in figure  10 is interesting .",
    "sn  1999ac has si  ii and s  ii absorptions that are less blueshifted than in sn  1996x , but fe  ii features from 4700 to 5100    that are more blueshifted . a fit for sn  1999ac is shown in figure  11 .",
    "the presence of o  i , si  ii , s  ii , ca  ii , and fe  ii in sn  1999ac is definite ; na  i , mg  ii and fe  iii are plausible .",
    "to account for the above mentioned peculiarity , we use a low photospheric velocity of 6000  and a higher @xmath9 for fe  ii ( 15,000 ) than for most of the other ions ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the spectra of sn  1999ac have been discussed extensively by garavini et  al .",
    "they emphasized the unusually low si  ii blueshift , consistent with our use of a low photospheric velocity .",
    "they also concluded that fe  ii lines formed at unusually low velocities , but our @xmath9 of 15,000  is the same as we use for the cn sn  1996x .",
    "the ca  ii ir3 feature of sn  2000cx obviously differs from the others of figure  9 . otherwise , the closest match to sn  2000cx is sn  1999aa , but there are conspicuous differences .",
    "the fit for sn  2000cx shown in figure  12 is unusual because , as in paper  ii , we resort to detached high  velocity ti  ii , cr  ii , and fe  ii .",
    "in fact , in the synthetic spectrum most of the photospheric features are at least mildly detached ( table  2 ) .",
    "still , the fit is not very good .",
    "although the synthetic ca  ii h and k absorption is much too strong , the ir3 does not appear .",
    "the observed multicomponent absorption of the ir3 has been discussed by li et  al .",

    "three weeks postmax is in the middle of what we referred to in paper  i as the `` si  ii  to  fe  ii transition phase '' ( from 14 to 28 days past maximum , for sn  1994d ) because the core of the 6100    absorption is present but flanked by strengthening fe  ii features .",
    "the 3 week postmax spectra are very different from the 1 week postmax spectra .",
    "figure  13 shows the 3 week postmax spectra of the cns , and a fit for sn  1996x is shown in figure  14 .",
    "the ions are the same as were used for sn  1994d at comparable epochs in paper  i. apart from the ca  ii and na  i features , the dominant ion is fe  ii , but si  ii , cr  ii , and to a lesser extent co  ii are also needed .",
    "fitting parameters for sn  1996x and other selected spectra of the 3 week postmax sample are given in table  3 .",
    "the degree of homogeneity in figure  13 is very high , except in two respects .",
    "first , sn  2001el and sn  2004s still have strong high velocity ca  ii h and k absorptions ( and most of the absorption features of sn  2004s continue to be somewhat less blueshifted than in the others ) .",
    "second , the relative heights of the flux peaks that flank the 5350    absorption are not all the same .",
    "the relative heights of these two peaks were discussed in paper  i : in sn  1994d the ratio of the peak on the right of the 5350    absorption to the peak on the left increased steadily from day  + 15 , when the peaks were roughly equally high , to day  + 28 , when the peak on the right was much higher .",
    "our fits accounted nicely for this evolution , in terms of strengthening fe  ii and cr  ii lines . in this respect ,",
    "some of the spectra of figure  13 appear to be spectroscopically `` earlier '' than some of the others .",
    "for example , the day  + 21 spectrum of sn  1998aq ( fig .",
    "13 ) has equally high peaks , like the day  + 15 spectrum of sn  1994d ( paper  i ) , and closely resembles that spectrum in other respects also .",
    "even cn spectra can get mildly out of phase , with respect to the time of b  band maximum .",
    "the 3 week postmax spectra of the bls are shown in figure  15 . at this epoch",
    "sn  1981b is like cn and so is sn  2002er , apart from its deep high velocity ca  ii h and k absorption ( which is not matched by the appearance of the ir3 absorption ) .",
    "even the extreme bl sn  1984a appears to differ only mildly from cn , although the limited wavelength coverage does not allow us to see how the ca  ii lines are behaving .",
    "figure  16 shows the 3 week postmax spectra of the cls . at this epoch sn  1989b and",
    "sn  2004eo are like cn .",
    "sn  1986 g remains mildly different , e.g. , its 5750    absorption is shallow , and the ratio of the flux peaks flanking the 5350    absorption is very large .",
    "sn  1991bg continues to show obvious differences .",
    "a fit for sn  1991bg is shown in figure  17 .",
    "all 7 ions used in the synthetic spectrum are considered to be definite . in the blue",
    "the synthetic spectrum is a complex blend of ti  ii , cr  ii , and fe  ii .",

    "sn  1999ee is similar to cn , although with a strong high velocity ca  ii h and k absorption .",
    "sn  1999aa also is similar to cn except for the spectroscopically `` early '' ratio of the flux peaks flanking the 5350    absorption . in this respect , as in others , the day  + 19 spectrum of sn  1999aa in figure  18 is a good match to the day  + 14 spectrum of sn  1994d ( paper  i ) .    as shown in previous papers",

    "the direct comparison in figure  19 of sn  2005hk and the cn sn  1996x shows that although the features of sn  2005hk are narrower , when the spectrum of sn  2005hk is artificially blueshifted , the features of the two spectra show a strong correspondence .",
    "not only the absorptions but also the flux peaks match up well .",
    "if the flux peaks of sn  2005hk were true emission peaks , at the rest wavelengths of the lines that produce them , then after the blueshifting , the peaks would be bluer than those of sn  1996x .",
    "this is in accord with the maxim that in heavily blended resonance ",

    "note that it is not @xmath12 , but @xmath9 for cr  ii , fe  ii , and co  ii that differs by 5000  from that of sn  1996x ( table  2 ) .",
    "apart from the two ca  ii features and the one na  i feature , the synthetic spectrum is a complex blend of fe  ii , cr  ii , and co  ii , just as it is for sn  1996x .    as can be seen in figure  18 , at this epoch sn  2000cx remains different from cn in several ways , e.g. , the peaks that appear near 4800 and 4920    in sn  1996x are smeared out in sn  2000cx . in this respect ,",

    "three months postmax is within what we referred to in paper  i as the `` fe  ii phase '' ( from 50 to 115 days after maximum for sn  1994d , with these particular limiting epochs being determined by the availability of spectra ) because the 6100    absorption is nearly gone at 50 days and the spectrum is mainly shaped by fe  ii lines .",

    "however , our fit is very poor from 6600 to 7800   . it may be that the broad flux minimum near 6750    is not an absorption feature , and that the flux peaks from 7270 to 7700 are produced by strong net emission .",

    "fit was not successful .",
    "however , our poor fit from 6600 to 7800    may signal that in this wavelength range forbidden emission lines are emerging without strong modification by permitted  line scattering . on the other hand ,",
    "if we make the fe  ii lines stronger , thereby making our fit worse in the blue , we do begin to obtain a better fit in the 6600 to 7800    interval .",

    "the fit for sn  1991bg in figure  25 shows that permitted  line scattering , mainly by fe  ii , shapes the spectrum in the blue , but the fit fails from 6000 to 8000   .",
    "the only clear evidence for forbidden lines is the strong emission near 7250   , due to [ ca  ii ] ( filippenko et  al .",
    "1992a ) .    at this epoch the probable ss sn  1995d and the extreme ss sn  1991 t ( fig .",
    "26 ) are like cn , and even the maverick sn  2000cx is only mildly different .",
    "the spectra that appear in this series of papers are simply the good spectra that are available to us , so the samples are affected not only by observational bias in favor of supernovae that are bright and have slowly declining light curves , but also by the observer bias in favor of obtaining and publishing spectra of unusual events .",
    "nevertheless , these samples clearly indicate a trend toward increasing spectroscopic conformity at later epochs . among the 24 sne  ia of the maximum light sample ( paper  ii ) ,",
    "only 7 were admitted to the ( by construction ) highly homogeneous cn group .",
    "by contrast , of the 12 sne  ia of the 3 months postmax sample , only sn  1991bg is distinctly different from the cns .",
    "( sn  2002cx  likes would be different too , if they were in the sample . )",
    "this spectroscopic convergence suggests that although the outer layers of sne  ia are diverse in various ways , the deep layers of most sne  ia are fundamentally the same .    in this paper ,",
    "the line identifications for the cns are much like they were in paper  i for sn  1994d , although the fitting parameters are different because of our present use of flat optical depth distributions .",
    "the conclusion that permitted lines strongly affect the spectrum as late as 3 months postmax leads to a caveat to the statement above that the deep layers of most sne  ia are fundamentally the same : at three months postmax the strongest permitted lines are strong , which entails line profile saturation and a limited sensitivity of the spectra to physical differences in the ejecta .",
    "if the spectra of the 3 months postmax sample consisted simply of optically thin forbidden emission lines , saturation would not be an issue and the observed spectroscopic homogeneity would imply a startling ( unbelievable ? ) degree of physical homogeneity .",
    "the degree of diversity should increase at still later times as the permitted lines weaken and the forbidden lines emerge unscathed .",
    "the transition from resonance  scattering to forbidden  line dominated spectra will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "as in previous papers of this series , we find that the bl sne  ia have essentially the same line identifications as the cns , but with more line optical depth at high velocities",
    ". the distinct characteristics of the extreme bl events sn  1984a , sn  2002bf , and sn  2006x at 1 week postmax raises the issue of whether they are a discrete subgroup , but only in terms of the properties of their outer layers .",
    "there is no evidence that their deep layers are unusual : by 3 months postmax , sn  2006x was like a cn .",
    "the spectrum of the extreme cl sn  1991bg has been thought to have undergone an early transition to the nebular phase ( filippenko et  al .",
    "1992a ; leibundgut et  al .",
    "1993 ; turatto et  al .",
    "1996 ; mazzali et  al .",
    "according to our interpretation ( fig .",
    "17 ) there is no need to appeal to forbidden lines in the 3 week postmax spectrum ( fig .",
    "17 ) , and even in the 3 month postmax spectrum the only obvious one is [ ca  ii ] 7291 , 7324 . in spite of its peculiarities , the spectrum of sn  1991bg does increasingly resemble the spectra of other sne  ia after maximum light , and in all respects sn  1986 g appears to be a link between sn  1991bg  likes and normal sne  ia . as discussed in paper  i , the spectroscopic peculiarities of sn  1991bg  likes may largely ( but not entirely ) reflect a temperature threshold below which key ionization ratios change abruptly .",
    "the issue of whether sn  1991bg  likes are a distinct subgroup remains open .",
    "the 1 week and 3 week postmax spectra of the ss sn  2000cx are unique among sne  ia observed so far .",
    "our identifications of high velocity ti  ii and especially cr  ii are not definite , but for nonstandard spectra , nonstandard identifications are to be expected , and no alternative identifications have been suggested . the resemblance of the 3 months postmax spectrum of sn  2000cx to cns suggests , though , that its deeper layers are like those of other sne  ia .",
    "the sn  2002cx - likes , on the other hand , appear to be radically different from other sne  ia , even in their deeper layers .",
    "pending the discovery of sne  ia having less mild sn  2002cx  like properties , the sn  2002cx  likes appear to be a discrete subgroup .",
    "yet the resemblance of their spectra , when artificially blueshifted , to other sne  ia ( fig .",
    "19 ) suggests kinship .",
    "although this series of papers is confined to spectroscopy , it is worth emphasizing that the spectroscopic diversity is bound to contribute to the photometric diversity .",
    "branch et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) discussed the effects of the putative high velocity ti  ii of sn  2000cx on the evolution its @xmath20 color .",
    "another good example is the 1 week postmax spectra of the extreme bls sn  2002bf , sn  1984a , and sn  2006x ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the deep fe  ii absorption from 4700 to 5100   , near the interesection of the b and v bands , throws flux right into the peak of the v band ( thus obscuring the s  ii absorptions ) and is bound to affect the b - v color evolution , with implications for attempts to estimate the interstellar extinction on the basis of broad band photometry ( e.g. , wang et  al .",
    "2007 for sn  2006x ) .    in recent years",
    "it has been shown ( mannucci et  al . 2005 , 2006 ; scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; sullivan et  al .",
    "2006 ) that some sne  ia , called prompt , are produced by a young ( @xmath0 yr ) stellar population while others , called tardy , are produced by an older population ( several gyr ) .",
    "most the sne  ia that have ever occurred were prompt , but at the present epoch most of the sne  ia at low redshift are tardy .",
    "this raises the question of which of our spectroscopic groups are prompt and which are tardy .",
    "since the extreme cl events such as sn  1991bg tend to occur in old populations and the extreme ss events such as sn  1991 t tend to occur in young populations ( sullivan et  al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) , if we are to break our groups into a minority of prompts and a majority of tardies , then the members of the ss group should tend to be prompts and the members of the other three groups tend to be tardies .",
    "yet there is no obvious spectroscopic separation between the ss group and the cn group .",
    "the cn group was defined to emphasize the strong spectroscopic homogeneity of its members , but several of the sss ( e.g. , sn  1999ee , sn  1999ac , sn  1999aa ) are not very different from cn .",
    "as discussed in paper  ii , it may be that there are two evolutionary paths to sne  ia that require different amounts of time but produce two families of sne  ia that have overlapping distributions of their properties .",
    "that being said , quimby et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that even among normal sne  ia ( in the broad sense of the term ) there may be two distinct classes of events : those that have a smoothly declining density distribution in their outer layers and therefore show a blueshift of the 6100    absorption that decreases smoothly with time , and those in which silicon is largely confined to a shell  like density structure and therefore have a more constant blueshift of the 6100    absorption .",
    "the smooth density structure is characteristic of deflagration and delayed detonation models , while a shell is characteristic of pulsating delayed detonation and tamped detonation models .",
    "the suggestion of quimby et  al . was motivated by a prolonged period of nearly constant blueshift in sn  2005hj , but they point out that some other sne  ia such as sn  1999aa and sn  2000cx are similar in this respect . in our classification , these three events are ss . more well observed ss and cn sne  ia are needed to determine whether ss and cn sne  ia are distinctly different in this respect .",
    "synow is useful for establishing line identifications and information on the velocity intervals in which the lines are forming , but it is no substitute for detailed calculations of spectra of hydrodynamical models . at present",
    "no 1d explosion model has been to shown to account well for the observed spectral evolution , not even for the cns ( baron et  al .",
    "spectropolarimetry and explosion modeling tells us that asymmetries are present , but the spectra of 3d explosion models can not yet even be calculated in full detail ( although a start has been made by calculating the spectra of 3d models for angle averaged compositions ; baron et  al .",
    "the homogeneity of the cns shows that there is a standard , repeatable sn  ia explosion model that does not have large compositional inhomogeneities near or below the maximum photospheric velocity of about 12,000   but what is this model ? and there are many additional questions , such as : what variation on the cn model is responsible for the extra high velocity matter in the bls , and the putative bizarre high velocity features of sn  2000cx , and the distinctive properties of the sn  2002cx  likes ? we have hardly begun on the path toward understanding the various manifestions of spectroscopic diversity of sne  ia .",
