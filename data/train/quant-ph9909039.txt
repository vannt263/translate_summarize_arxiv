    "[ introduction ]    the main goal of this paper is to give a pedagogical introduction to quantum information theory  to do this in a new way , using network diagrams called quantum bayesian ( qb ) nets .",
    "the paper assumes no prior knowledge of classical@xcite-@xcite or quantum@xcite-@xcite information theory .",
    "it does assume a good understanding of the machinery of quantum mechanics , such as one would obtain by reading any reasonable textbook that explains dirac bra - ket formalism . the paper reviews qb nets in an appendix .",
    "if you have difficulty understanding said appendix , you might want to read ref.@xcite before continuing this paper .",
    "most of the ideas discussed in this paper are not new .",
    "they are well - known , standard ideas invented by the pioneers ( bennett , holevo , peres , schumacher , wootters , etc . ) of the field of quantum information theory .",
    "what is new about this paper is that , whenever possible and advantageous , we rephrase those ideas in the visual language of qb nets",
    ". the paper does present a few new ideas , such as associating with each qb net a very useful density matrix that we call the meta density matrix of the net .",
    "the topics covered in this paper are shown in the table of contents .",
    "the paper , in its present form , is far from being a complete account of the field of quantum information theory .",
    "some important topics that were left out ( because the author did nt have enough time to write them up ) are : quantum compression , quantum error correction , channel capacities , quantum approximate cloning , entanglement quantification and manipulation .",
    "future editions of this paper may include some of these topics .",
    "i welcome any suggestions or comments . to fill in gaps left by this paper , or to find alternative explanations of difficult topics , see refs.@xcite-@xcite and references therein .",
    "[ notation ]    in this section , we will introduce certain notation which is used throughout the paper .",
    "we define @xmath0 to be the set @xmath1 for any integers @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 .",
    "for any finite set @xmath5 , let @xmath6 denote the number of elements in @xmath5 .    the kronecker delta function @xmath7 equals one if @xmath8 and zero otherwise .",
    "we will often abbreviate @xmath7 by @xmath9 .",
    "we will often use the symbol @xmath10 to mean that one must sum whatever is on the right - hand side of this symbol over all repeated indices ( a sort of einstein summation convention ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath11 will mean that one should sum over all indices .",
    "if we wish to exclude a particular index from the summation , we will indicate this by a slash followed by the name of the index .",
    "for example , in @xmath12 or @xmath13 we wish to exclude summation over @xmath14 .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined by    = (    cc 0&1 + 1&0    ) , = (    cc 0&-i + i&0    ) , = (    cc 1&0 + 0&-1    ) .    for any real @xmath18",
    "$ ] , we define the binary entropy function @xmath19 by    h(p ) = -p_2(p ) - ( 1-p)_2 ( 1-p ) .    when speaking of bits with states 0 and 1 , we will often use an overbar to represent the opposite state : @xmath20 , @xmath21",
    ".    we will underline random variables .",
    "for example , we might write @xmath22 for the probability that the random variable @xmath23 assumes value @xmath2",
    ". @xmath24 will often be abbreviated by @xmath25 when no confusion will arise .",
    "@xmath26 will denote the set of values which the random variable @xmath23 may assume , and @xmath27 will denote the number of elements in @xmath26 . with each random variable @xmath23 , we will associate an orthonormal basis @xmath28 which we will call the _",
    "@xmath23 basis_. we will represent by @xmath29 the hilbert space spanned by the @xmath23 basis .",
    "@xmath30 will mean the same thing as @xmath31 ; @xmath30 is just a more explicit notation that indicates that @xmath31 belongs to @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath32 are any @xmath33 random variables , we will use @xmath34 to denote @xmath35 .",
    "whenever we use the word  ditto \" , as in  x ( ditto , y ) \" , we mean that the statement is true if x is replaced by y. for example , if we say  a ( ditto , x ) is smaller than b ( ditto , y ) \" , we mean  a is smaller than b \" and  x is smaller than y \" .",
    "this paper will also utilize certain notation associated with classical and quantum bayesian nets .",

    ", one uses the words  information \" and  entropy \" interchangeably . in the context of communication theory ,",
    "the word  information \" means _",
    "information content of an average message_. given any random variable @xmath39 , one may think of a sequence @xmath40 of samples of @xmath39 as a message .",
    "then one makes the assumption that the more information an average message ( of fixed length ) carries , the higher the variance of @xmath39 will be , and vice versa .",

    "when dealing with a cb net , it is convenient to rephrase eq.([eq : ce - h - def ] ) in terms of the node random variables of the net . consider a cb net @xmath45 with @xmath33 nodes labelled by the random variables @xmath46 .",
    "these @xmath33 random variables are related by a joint probability distribution @xmath47 .",

    "the probability distributions @xmath51 $ ] , @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] can be obtained by summing @xmath47 over the unwanted arguments , a process called marginalization .",

    "it is convenient to extend definitions eqs.([eq : ce - h - simple ] ) to ( [ eq : ce - h - mutual ] ) in the following two ways .",

    "second , we will allow @xmath59 ( ditto , @xmath60 ) to contain internal parentheses .",
    "if it does , then we will ignore the internal parentheses .",
    "for example , if @xmath62 are nodes of a cb net , then    h [ ( , ) , ] = h ( , , ) , h[| ( ( , ) , ) ] = h[| ( , , ) ] .",
