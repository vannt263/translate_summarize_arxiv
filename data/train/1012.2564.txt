    "low energy @xmath5 annihilation into hadrons is a source of valuable information about the interactions of light quarks .",
    "precise measurements of the exclusive cross section appear important for different applications like , e.g. , determination of various qcd parameters  quark masses , quark and gluon condenstates  @xcite , calculation of the hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and running fine structure constant  @xcite .    the hypothesis of conserved",
    "vector current and isospin symmetry relate to each other the isovector part of @xmath6 hadrons and corresponding ( vector current ) hadronic decay of the @xmath2 lepton  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the deep relation between weak and electromagnetic ( em ) interactions .",
    "the vector weak current and the isovector part of the electromagnetic vector current are different components of the same vector current , so that the matrix element of these currents must be identical assuming su(2 ) symmetry . in this case",
    "the weak isovector current is assumed to be conserved in analogy to the em current .",
    "this assumption is the cvc hypothesis .    as a consequence ,",
    "hadronic currents describing vector @xmath2 decays and low energy ( up to the @xmath2 lepton mass ) @xmath5 annihilation are related and can be obtained one from another .",
    "these relations allow one to use an independent high - statistics data sample from @xmath2 decays for increasing the accuracy of the prediction of the spectral functions directly measured in @xmath3 annihilation  @xcite .    the very first application of this idea was very fruitful  @xcite , but increasing experimental precision in both @xmath5 and @xmath2 sectors revealed unexpected problems : the @xmath7 and @xmath8 spectral functions from @xmath2 decays were significantly higher than those obtained from @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "although tension in this sector has been recently somewhat decreased after a reestimation of the isospin breaking corrections  @xcite , it is important to understand the reasons causing the deviations between the spectral functions .",
    "one of the necessary steps is to perform a systematic test of cvc relations using all available experimental information on various final states .",
    "for the vector part of the weak hadronic current , the distribution of the mass of the produced hadronic system is : @xmath9    where the spectral function @xmath10 is given by the expression : @xmath11 and @xmath12 is an electroweak correction equal to 1.0194  @xcite .",
    "since the vector part of the weak current has a positive @xmath13-parity , the allowed quantum numbers for hadronic decays are : @xmath14    after integration the branching fraction of the @xmath2 decay is @xmath15 @xmath16    in this work we focus on two specific final states of @xmath3 annihilation ( @xmath17 decay ) : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations for the corresponding decay modes of the @xmath2 lepton based on cvc were earlier performed by many authors , see the bibliography in ref .",
    ". new comparison of cvc - based predictions with measurements of @xmath2 lepton decays were motivated by recent progress of experiments on @xmath2 decays as well as by the updated information from @xmath5 annihilation into hadrons , coming mostly from the babar  @xcite and snd  @xcite collaborations .    for numerical estimates",
    "we use the value of the electronic branching @xmath22 = ( 17.85 @xmath23 0.05)% and @xmath24 recommended by rpp-2010  @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath26 was recently studied by the babar collaboration using isr in the broad energy range from 1  gev to 3  gev  @xcite and by the snd collaboration in the energy range from 1.1  gev to 1.4  gev  @xcite .",
    "earlier measurements were performed at the nd  @xcite , cmd-2  @xcite detectors from 1.25 to 1.4  gev and at the dm1  @xcite and dm2  @xcite detectors from 1.4 to 2  gev . the results of various measurements are shown in fig .  1 . in general , they are in fair agreement with each other within errors although below 1.4 gev the values of the cross section from babar are somewhat higher than those of the previous experiments . above this energy , the results from babar",
    "are higher than those from dm2 , whereas they are in good agreement with much less precise data of dm1 .",
    "a more detailed information about the data samples used can be found in table  [ table1 ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      for future applications of our results aimed at the improvement of the existing monte carlo generators of @xmath3 annihilation  @xcite and @xmath2 decay  @xcite we perform the approximation of the cross section of the process @xmath0 .",
    "its energy dependence is described by a sum of the @xmath27(1450 ) and @xmath28(1700 ) contributions ( independently we check that the one from the @xmath29 tail is negligible in this energy range ) : @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 are mass , width and peak cross section of the intermediate @xmath27 or @xmath28 , @xmath33 is the relative phase of the @xmath34 interference , and @xmath35 is a smooth function arising from the decay matrix element squared and the phase space , which is written as an integral over the kinematically allowed region on the @xmath36@xmath37 plane :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 are energies and momenta of pions , @xmath40 is a factor reflecting the properties of vector particle decay into three pseudoscalars and @xmath41 is a function characterizing @xmath42(770)@xmath43 decay dynamics and can be written as :    @xmath44    since our knowledge of decay channels of both @xmath27(1450 ) and @xmath28(1700 ) mesons is rather poor , the energy - dependent widths are written as :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are full width and mass of the resonances .    in view of the observed excess of babar",
    "cross sections over all others , we perform two independent fits  that of babar and all other data .",
    "results of the fits are shown in fig .  4 together with the difference between them ( the dashed line ) .",
    "as one can see , the difference is higher than zero in the whole energy range which may point at the fact that cross sections obtained by babar are systematically somewhat higher than those from previous experiments .",
    "recently the babar collaboration has presented the very first measurement of the cross section of the process @xmath49",
    "@xcite , see fig .  5 .",
    "the cross section of the process clearly shows resonance behavior with a maximum slightly above 2 gev .",
    "we fit the cross section assuming that it is described by a single resonance and parameterizing it with the breit - wigner amplitude for production of three pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "the following resonance parameters ( mass , width and cross section at the peak ) have been obtained :    . ]",
    "@xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    here the systematic error of @xmath53 is 10% following the estimate of the overall systematic error of the cross section in ref .",
    "@xcite . taking into account that we do not estimate systematic uncertainties on mass and width , one can conclude that the resonance parameters are compatible with those of the @xmath42(2150 )  @xcite .",
    "since the values of the cross section are very low and have large uncertainties , we do not integrate directly the experimental points to estimate the branching fraction from cvc .",
    "instead , we use ( 4 ) and integrate the optimal curve for the cross section up to the @xmath2 mass and obtain : @xmath54 where the first error is statistical ( that of the fit ) , the second one is experimental systematic and the third is the model one estimated by using the world average values of the @xmath42(2150 ) mass and width and varying them within the errors .",
    "the obtained result is consistent with zero and we place the following upper limit at 90% cl using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath55 which is two and a half times more restrictive than the upper limit based on the only existing measurement from cleo  @xcite : @xmath56 but still an order of magnitude higher than a theoretical prediction @xmath57 based on the chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "using data on the processes @xmath58 and cvc we obtained the following results :    * for @xmath59 the expected branching fraction is ( 0.153 @xmath23 0.018)% compatible with the world average of ( 0.139 @xmath23 0.008)% ; * the spectral functions of the @xmath60 system in @xmath3 annihilation and @xmath2 decay are consistent ; * for @xmath61 the upper limit on the branching fraction is @xmath62 or 2.5 times smaller than the experimental one of @xmath63 8 @xmath64 10@xmath65 , both at 90% cl .",
