    "the analysis of the fission probability and of the angular distribution of the fission fragments support the presence of hyperdeformed states in a deep third well in several th and u isotopes @xcite confirming the pioneering work of blons et al @xcite in @xmath0th .",
    "the observed strongly enhanced low energy @xmath1 decay in some heavy actinide nuclei is also explained by transition from a third hyperdeformed minimum and the possibility that the third minimum is the true ground state of very heavy and perhaps superheavy nuclei is even also advocated @xcite . in medium mass nuclei",
    "some signs of hyperdeformed rotational bands have been found , but no discrete hd level has been identified @xcite .    by adding at the macroscopic liquid drop model energy of elongated one - body shapes an oscillatory microscopic contribution , the strutinsky s method @xcite generated double - humped barriers allowing to predict and explain the fission isomer characteristics .",
    "myers and swiatecki @xcite proposed analytic formulae in the same objective of taking into account the shell and pairing energies .",
    "later on , the asymmetric two - center shell model @xcite , hartree - fock - bogoliubov @xcite and relativistic mean field theories @xcite have also allowed to reproduce double - humped barriers .",
    "the heights of the inner and asymmetric outer fission barriers are almost constant ( 5 - 6 mev ) from th to am isotopes @xcite .",
    "it is a severe test for the theoretical models . in the actinide region",
    "the third hyperdeformed minimum was predicted by mller et al @xcite and by recent theoretical approaches @xcite .    it has been previously shown within a generalized liquid drop model taking into account both the proximity energy between close opposite surfaces , the asymmetry and an accurate radius that most of the symmetric and asymmetric fission @xcite",

    "the purpose of this work is , within this gldm , to go beyond the two separated sphere approximation by taking into account the ellipsoidal deformations of the two different fission fragments and their associated shell and pairing energies , investigating all the possible mass and charge asymmetries .",
    "the total energy of a deformed nucleus is the sum of the macroscopic gldm energy , the shell correction energy and the pairing energy .",
    "the gldm energy is given by @xcite @xmath2 where the different terms are respectively the volume , surface , coulomb , nuclear proximity and rotational energies .",
    "all along the deformation path the nuclear proximity energy term @xmath3 allows to take into account the effects of the attractive nuclear forces between nucleons facing each other across a neck in the case of a deformed one - body shape or across a gap in the case of two separated fragments .",

    "the proximity energy flattens the potential energy curve and will explain the formation of a deep second minimum for heaviest nuclei .",
    "the shell effects are attenuated at these large deformations . in the exit channel corresponding to the two - sphere approximation the top of the barrier ( @xmath69 fm on this example )",
    "is reached after the rupture of the matter bridge between the two spherical fragments ( @xmath70 fm ) .",
    "then , the top corresponds to two separated spherical fragments maintained in unstable equilibrium by the balance between the attractive nuclear forces and the repulsive coulomb ones . in this path",
    ", the introduction of the shell and pairing effects for two - body shapes is not sufficient to reproduce accurately the experimental data on the fission barrier heights of actinide nuclei .",
    "the transition between one - body and two - body shapes is less smooth when the ellipsoidal deformations of the fragments and the proximity energy are taken into account .",
    "it corresponds to the passage ( at @xmath71 fm for @xmath67th ) from a one - body shape with spherical ends and a deep neck to two touching ellipsoidal fragments , one or both of them being slightly oblate .",
    "the barrier height is reduced by several mev .",
    "the introduction of the shell effects still lowers the second peak and shifts it to an inner position ( @xmath72 fm here ) .",
    "it even leads to a third minimum and third peak in this asymmetric decay path .",
    "a plateau appears also at larger distances around 10 mev below the ground state .",
    "it is due to the end of the contact between the two fragments and the persistence of the prolate deformation of the lightest fragment .",
    "the end of the plateau corresponds to the rapid transition from prolate to oblate shapes for the non - magical fragment and the vanishing of the proximity energy .",

    "it is important to mention that to obtain these barriers the only input parameters are @xmath78 and @xmath79 and that the calculations are very rapid on an usual computer and , consequently , can be integrated in a more general and complex code .    for a given mass asymmetry , the charge asymmetry which minimizes",
    "the deformation energy has been selected .",
    "the proximity energy and the attenuated microscopic effects are responsible for the formation of a second one - body shape minimum .",
    "the heights of the two peaks generally increase with the asymmetry but the shell and pairing corrections induce strong variations from this global behaviour .",
    "their main effect is to favour , for the u , pu , am and cm isotopes , an asymmetric path where one fragment is close to the doubly magic number @xmath80sn nucleus , and , consequently , keeps an almost spherical shape .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for @xmath76 cm and @xmath77cf since for nuclei with @xmath81 the symmetric fission gives fragments with a charge of around 50 .",
    "for these nuclei a symmetric and an asymmetric exit channels are compared on the lower part of the figures [ am243244cm243 ] and [ cf250bk250 ] .",
    "a third minimum and third peak appear in the asymmetric decay path .",

    "double and triple - humped fission barriers appear for the actinide elements in the quasi - molecular shape path within a macroscopic - microscopic deformation energy derived from a generalized liquid drop model and analytic expressions for the shell and pairing energies .",
    "the second peak corresponds to the transition from one - body shapes to two touching ellipsoids .",
    "the third barrier appears only in the asymmetric decay path and for some specific nuclei .",
    "then , the heaviest fragment is almost a magic nucleus and it preserves its shape close to the sphere .",
    "the other fragment evolves from an oblate ellipsoid to a prolate one and the third peak corresponds to the maximum of the shell effects in the non magic fragment and , consequently , to two touching different spheres .",
