    "they also find that @xmath53 depends on @xmath7 as @xmath53 is larger for small @xmath7 .",
    "metallicity , in addition , is a fundamental parameter determining the @xmath53 ratio , and is decreasing exponentially with radius in the galaxy ( sakamoto @xcite ) . from a study of 5 local group galaxies wilson ( @xcite )",

    "though these structures are bigger than typical galactic gmcs , we try to derive a value of @xmath53 for these molecular complexes from two different methods : the virial theorem and the visual extinction @xmath54 .",
    "the latter method requires an assumption about the relative distribution of stars and gas along line - of - sight .      in order to calculate the virial mass",
    ", we used @xmath55 where @xmath56 is in m@xmath5 , @xmath57 is the effective diameter in pc and @xmath58 is in kms@xmath26 ( solomon et al .",
    "this formula is obtained assuming that the cloud is a sphere with a power - law ( @xmath59=1 ) density distribution .",
    "if instead we represent the cloud as a sphere with uniform density , the virial mass is then : @xmath60 and the mass is just 10% higher .    to calculate the masses , we derived from the spectra the rms noise @xmath61 and the linewidths at half intensity @xmath58 . and",
    "from the line contour maps we measured the size of the complex at a 3@xmath61 level as well as the integrated intensity @xmath7 averaged over the cloud s area ; an effective diameter @xmath57 is then derived from the area of the complex ( area=@xmath62 ) .",
    "we make the hypothesis that the clouds are spherical so that there is no effect due to the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "the cloud diameters were deconvolved from the synthesized beam using a gaussian model .",
    "anyway as they are about twice the fwhm of the synthesized beam , the deconvolution just leads to a 10% smaller virial mass and a 10% smaller value of @xmath53 .    because the clouds in this paper have a rather large sky - plane radius ( @xmath63 pc ) , it is likely that they are somewhat flattened .",
    "the thickness of the molecular disk is 120 pc ( fwhm ) in the milky way ( combes @xcite ) and probably smaller in because of the lower velocity dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , the following example suggests that the virial mass of the cloud calculated by assuming these clouds are spherical is close to that obtained for a somewhat flattened cloud because the inclination correction tends to compensate for the oblateness correction . the virial mass for an oblate spheroid of uniform density and eccentricity @xmath64 is the mass for the uniform density sphere multiplied by the factor @xmath64/arcsin @xmath64 ( binney & tremaine @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination correction to reduce the effective diameter to face - on ( inclination @xmath65 ) increases from a factor of 1 for a sphere to a factor of ( cos @xmath66)@xmath67 for a highly flattened spheroid .",

    "the total uncertainty on these values is about 50% .",
    "the mean value of @xmath53 is @xmath69 h@xmath10@xmath51/(kkms@xmath70 for the six clouds .",
    "the uncertainties are much bigger for complexes c3 and c5 which are located on the border of the primary beam , and for complex c6 which has fainter emission . omitting these clouds with less well determined parameters ,",
    "the mean value of @xmath53 is @xmath71 h@xmath10@xmath51/(kkms@xmath26 ) .",

    "the value of @xmath53 is unusually large .",
    "if the molecular hydrogen + helium mass represents the virial mass , such a large ratio means that , though co emission in this field is weak , there is a lot of h@xmath10 . as",
    "the metallicity is normal , this could be due to a recent massive hi to h@xmath10 conversion due to collisions ; clouds c1 , c2 and c5 are along the dust lane a little downstream from the hi ridge and may form a cloud collision front ( elmegreen @xcite ) .",
    "we may be seeing only the warm envelopes of cold molecular clumps , so the integrated co intensity may not represent the entire molecular mass of the cloud . alternatively ,",
    "if the true @xmath53 value in is in fact comparable to the galactic one , the virial mass is about 3 times bigger than the molecular mass and either the clouds are virialized because of a large mass of stars and/or cold atomic gas not taken into account in these calculations ( see next paragraphs ) , or the clouds are not virialized . in particular , taylor &",

    "they have identified three gmcs with diameters @xmath74100pc and very narrow linewidths of 4.77.7 kms@xmath26 .",
    "their field also has nearly solar metallicity , and their values for the integrated co flux and @xmath56 imply that @xmath53 is @xmath75 h@xmath10@xmath51/(kkms@xmath26 ) in their clouds .",
    "the gmcs peak brightness temperatures are 3k and with beam dilution it is consistent with the mean 1k peak brightness temperature of the complexes of this paper .",
    "thus it is possible that the molecular complexes identified in this paper contain several ( 2 or 3 ) gravitationally bound clouds of mass a few 10@xmath8m@xmath5 and size @xmath76100pc not resolved in our data . in the case of cloud",
    "c3 , which is associated to the giant hii region ( see sect .",
    "[ hii ] ) , we find the standard @xmath53 value and , though the derived parameters are more uncertain , it could be a single gravitationally bound cloud .    in the virial mass we have neglected the mass of the stars .",
    "indeed if we assume that the mass of the optical disk is about @xmath77m@xmath5 within a radius of 20kpc , with an exponential distribution for the surface density @xmath78 , @xmath79=3kpc , the surface density 6.5kpc far from the center is @xmath80m@xmath5pc@xmath81 .",
    "this is comparable to a gmcs typical mean surface density ( 170m@xmath5pc@xmath81 , solomon et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but the stellar distribution has a scale height of about 10 times that of the gmc , so that the volume density is about 10 times smaller for the stars than for the gmcs and we can neglect the mass of the stars at such a distance from the center .",
    "however the molecular surface densities derived for the clouds are smaller ( 30150m@xmath5pc@xmath81 ) with the derived @xmath53 ratio and even smaller ( 730m@xmath5pc@xmath81 ) with the standard @xmath53 value .",
    "thus the mass of the stars may be less negligible compared to the molecular mass and may contribute to the binding of the clouds .    in these calculations",
    "we have also neglected the hi gas .",
    "however there is a good agreement between the co and hi distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ hi / co ] ) and velocities ( see table 1 , where the hi velocities were measured by adler on the hi image with @xmath41 resolution from adler and westpfahl @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that there is a shift between the hi and co maxima but the difference of resolution ( @xmath82 for the hi map of hine ( @xcite ) and @xmath83 for the co map ) does not allow us to conclude about whether the shift is significant . in section 4.2 we conclude that for cloud c1 the hi is not associated with the molecular cloud as it is mainly in a cold dust lane at high @xmath84 ; this is also true for cloud c2 since the overlaid hi is along the same hi feature . in the case of cloud c3 , it is clear that one should not include the entire hi column density in the cloud mass , because the resulting @xmath85(hi ) alone times the 1.36 correction factor for helium would equal @xmath86 ( see sect .",

    "for the other complexes , if we take into account the hi correction in the virial mass calculation and we assume that all the hi column density measured towards the co complexes ( hine @xcite ) also contributes to the virial mass @xmath87 , then we deduce a mean @xmath53 ratio of @xmath88 h@xmath10@xmath51/(kkms@xmath70 , or omitting complexes c3 , c5 , and c6 , which have more uncertain parameters , the mean @xmath53 is @xmath89 h@xmath10@xmath51/(kkms@xmath70 .    nevertheless , the most plausible explanation for the high values of x is that the complexes are not virialized but consist of a few unresolved self - gravitating clouds .",

    "we can finally assume that there is both diffuse optically thin hi ( at a typical temperature of 100k ) and the hi confined to the dust lane at a high @xmath84 and optically thick ( at a typical temperature of 10k ) .",
    "it can be the same for the co emission as we detect the less optically thick emission and we do nt see the gas providing most of the extinction .",
    "we can thus account for the observed extinction given the measured hi and co emissions .",
    "however , we note that the dust position in cloud c1 is not one of the positions measured by kaufman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) with a large discrepancy between the extinction and @xmath95 .",
    "cloud c3 and the taylor & wilson ( @xcite ) cloud mc2 represent the first identifications in of co emission associated with an individual giant hii region ( see fig .",
    "previous co observations of had too low a spatial resolution to connect the weak co emission with the star - forming regions , so it has long been a puzzle as to how is forming massive ob associations in the presence of so little molecular gas .",
    "the answer for the interferometer field of fig .",
    "1 is that most of the molecular mass , as indexed by the co emission , is in the form of @xmath113m@xmath5 complexes , suitable as birthplaces for large ob associations .",
    "the giant hii region 138 , with excitation parameter u=250pc@xmath51 and diameters 17@xmath20x13@xmath20 ( kaufman et al .",
    "@xcite ) appears inside cloud c3 . in projection ,",
    "the center of the cloud complex is displaced 7@xmath20=120pc from the center of the hii region .",
    "the location of the hii region is suggestive of a blister ; possibly , the molecular gas on the eastern side of the hii region was photodissociated by the ob stars .",
    "also , kaufman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) conjecture that a nonthermal radio source adjacent to the southeastern side of the hii region may be an snr , which would have affected the molecular cloud . in the milky way , individual hii regions with free - free radio luminosity similar to that of hii region 138",
    "are associated with molecular clouds of mass 410@xmath8 to 410@xmath114m@xmath5 ( myers et al .",
    "if cloud c3 , associated with hii region 138 , is a single virialized cloud , its mass ( 0.910@xmath114m@xmath5 ) lies within this range .",
    "hii region 172 ( kaufman et al .",
    "@xcite ) near cloud mc2 in the taylor & wilson ( @xcite ) field has a free - free radio luminosity similar to hii region 138 , but mc2 has a virial mass of only 310@xmath8m@xmath5 , i.e. , at the low end of the milky way range for clouds related to such luminous hii regions .",
    "integrating the entire hi column density over the solid angle of the hii region gives an hi mass @xmath85(hi ) of 1.110@xmath114m@xmath5 for hii region 138 and 2.310@xmath114m@xmath5 for hii region 172 ( kaufman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , not corrected for helium . in both cases , the molecular cloud is displaced towards the western side of the hii region , and the atomic mass in the region exceeds the molecular mass .",
    "a layer of gas with column density 1.210@xmath90atom@xmath51 in front of the hii region would suffice to explain its observed extinction , @xmath115=0.7@xmath1160.3mag . averaged over the hii region , the co integrated intensity is 1.9kkms@xmath26 , which corresponds to a total column density through the disk of 510@xmath110 h@xmath10@xmath51 if we use the value of @xmath53 = 2.710@xmath110 h@xmath10@xmath51/(kkms@xmath26 ) found for cloud c3 , and the hi column density through the disk is 2.410@xmath90atom@xmath51 .",
    "thus there is more than enough gas to account for the observed extinction , and the hii region is probably either at the midplane of the gas layer or slightly to the near side .",
    "we have mapped and identified in six molecular complexes with virial masses @xmath33 1310@xmath114m@xmath5 and radii @xmath117pc in an optimally - chosen field of deprojected size 1.1 @xmath24 2.1kpc ( the inclination of is 59@xmath118 ) . comparing the virial masses with the co fluxes of these clouds",
    ", we find a mean value of the @xmath119/@xmath7 ratio 3 times stronger than the standard galactic value and 2 times more than the value expected for such metallicities .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that the complexes are the average of several gravitationally bound clouds not resolved in our data .",
    "a possible exception is cloud c3 which is associated to the giant hii region and , though the derived parameters are more uncertain , it could be a single gravitationally bound cloud .",
    "severe beam dilution in the single - dish surveys ( e.g. , with the nrao 12 m telescope ) appears to account , in part , for the weakness of the overall co emission from in such surveys .",
    "however we observed here an optimal field as it overlapped one of the stronger fields in the co single - dish surveys .",
    "its co emission may not be typical of as a whole : the sum of the virial masses of the six complexes is 8.710@xmath114m@xmath5 , which gives an upper limit to the h@xmath10 mass of 6.410@xmath114m@xmath5 if helium is omitted .",
    "( on the other hand , if the standard value of @xmath53 applies , the h@xmath10 mass is 2.310@xmath114m@xmath5 , omitting helium . )",
    "the upper limit is @xmath336% of the total molecular mass of .",
    "the corresponding hi mass of this field is 1.6510@xmath120m@xmath5 , which leads to a molecular to atomic gas ratio of 0.14 if we use the standard value of @xmath53 and neglect a diffuse component , or up to 0.6 if we use the sum of the virial masses and take the upper limit on the diffuse component from the comparison of the 30 m and interferometer data .",
    "furthermore this field contains a giant radio hii region coinciding with one of the molecular complexes and the other clouds are on the uv - bright arm , so that there is adequate heating of the gas .",
    "but the observed narrow linewidths have still to be explained .    the upper limit to the average molecular column density in this optimum field on the arm ( obtained from the sum of the virial masses )",
    "is approximately 6m@xmath5pc@xmath81 .",
    "this is much smaller than even the interarm surface density of molecular gas in the co - rich galaxy ( see rand et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the 3 gmcs in m81 detected by taylor and wilson ( @xcite ) in another field of the spiral arms have co integrated fluxes of 1.63.2 jykms@xmath26 , diameters of @xmath33 100pc , and linewidths of 58kms@xmath26 . for comparison , our 6 complexes have co integrated flux of 1.35.0 jykms@xmath26 , diameters of 160200 pc , and linewidths of 714kms@xmath26 .",
    "thus our complexes have somewhat similar @xmath0co(10 ) fluxes but significantly larger areas . in both cases ,",
    "the linewidths are narrow as compared to galactic clouds of the same diameter .",
    "this has some interesting implications .",
    "because of the low velocity dispersion , it is possible that the scale height of the molecular gas is smaller than in the milky way .",
    "however , if the complexes are not significantly flattened , then the mean volume density in the m81 clouds must be less than in galactic clouds .",
    "this would mean that the clouds themselves are different from those in the milky way .",
    "taylor and wilson ( @xcite ) speculate that their clouds might be complexes consisting of several subclouds , like the orion complex .",
    "this is one way in which the mean volume density could be reduced .    from our interferometric and single - dish data ,",
    "it seems that this field in has no fewer molecular complexes than other comparable galaxies but lacks a significant widespread distribution of small molecular clouds ( in the limits of the calibration uncertainties , i.e. less than about 30% of the total flux ) .",
    "this lack of small molecular clouds could be due , in this particular field , to a collision front ( see sect .",
    "[ virial ] ) where the small clouds have agglomerated into big ones .",
    "another possibility is that , as the molecular surface density in is low , the small diffuse clouds have less self - shielding against co photodissociation than the gmcs .    in the regions of with little uv emission (",
    "e.g. the interarm regions and parts of the central 4kpc hi hole ) , there is little heating of the gas , so most of the co gas there may be too cold to have been detected in the surveys thus far .",
    "allen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reach the same conclusion from their picture of hi as a product of star formation process , and they speculate that the gas in the main part of the disk of is largely in the form of molecular hydrogen with a low excitation temperature .",
    "it is still uncertain whether the @xmath0co(10 ) emission from as a whole can be used directly as a reliable tracer of the molecular gas .",
