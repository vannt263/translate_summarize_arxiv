    "hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure growth predict that when the initial density perturbations collapse , gas should be shock - heated to temperatures of @xmath16  @xmath17k ( ostriker & cen 1996 ; dav et al .",
    "1999 ; cen & ostriker 1999a ) . the fraction of the gas which has been heated to these temperatures increases with decreasing redshift , and at the present epoch , the model of cen & ostriker ( 1999a ) predicts that 47 % of the baryons ( by mass ) are in this shock - heated phase , hereafter referred to as warm / hot gas ( to distinguish it from the hotter gas in rich galaxy clusters which are readily detected x - ray sources ) .",
    "this warm / hot gas prediction has not been adequately tested by observations because the soft x - rays emitted by gas at these temperatures are difficult to detect with current instrumentation , especially at lower temperatures where corrections for foreground absorption and emission are complicated .",
    "however , it may be possible to detect gas in the lower half of this temperature range via absorption lines of species such as , , or in the spectrum of a background qso ( verner , tytler , & barthel 1994 ) .",
    "it is important to search for this warm / hot gas as part of the census of matter in the universe and because it could affect the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters ( e.g. , blanton et al . 2000 ) .",
    "there are some indications that warm / hot gas is present in some galaxy groups .",
    "for example , mulchaey et al . (",
    "1996 ) have noted that rosat observations show that poor galaxy groups which are rich in elliptical galaxies tend to exhibit x - ray emission ( e @xmath18 0.5 kev ) while spiral - rich groups do not .",
    "they suggest that spiral - rich groups contain cooler ( @xmath19 k ) intragroup gas which is not easily detected in x - rays , and they predict that the intragroup medium of spiral - rich groups will produce absorption lines of , but not or because their column densities are too low at @xmath20k .",
    "interestingly , savage , tripp , & lu ( 1998 ) have recently identified a qso absorber in the spectrum of h1821 + 643 ( @xmath21 = 0.297 ) which fits this description : absorption lines with two nearby spiral galaxies but no accompanying or lines .",
    "however , the absorption could be due to the halo of the closer spiral galaxy ( which is at a projected distance of 105 @xmath22 kpc ) rather than the intragroup medium , and savage et al .",
    "show that the absorption could plausibly arise in very low density photoionized gas .",
    "the doublet has been identified in several other intervening absorption systems  @xmath23 ( e.g. , papovich et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "these are a rather different class of absorber which are often known to be very close to the qso ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) . in this paper",
    ", we have focused our analysis and discussion on the intervening systems . ] both at moderate redshifts ( e.g. , bergeron et al . 1994 ; burles & tytler 1996 ; jannuzi et al . 1998 ; lopez et al .",
    "1999 ; churchill & charlton 1999 ) and at high redshifts ( kirkman & tytler 1997,1999 ) .",
    "composite spectra and statistical techniques have also been used to show that absorption is present at high @xmath11 ( lu & savage 1993 ; dav et al .",
    "1998 ) . in most cases",
    "it has been difficult to pin down the ionization mechanism definitively , partly due to the low resolution of the observations made with first - generation _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ spectrographs , but in several cases there is evidence that the systems occur in multiphase absorbing media .",
    "an important step in this approach to the search for warm / hot gas is to determine whether the absorbers trace collisionally ionized gas or photoionized gas .    as part of the program described by tripp , lu , & savage ( 1998 ) to study low @xmath11 ly@xmath2  absorption line systems , we have recently observed the low redshift qso pg0953 + 415 ( @xmath21 = 0.239 ) with the e140 m echelle mode of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "this high resolution fuv spectrum has revealed another highly ionized absorber associated with a group of spiral galaxies , and in this paper we present our analysis of this particular absorbing system . in ",
    "2 we review the observations and data reductions including measurements of galaxy redshifts with the wiyn telescope .",
    "we present in  3 the absorption line measurements .",
    "we constrain the temperature of the gas and examine its ionization in  4 , and we discuss the implications of the observations in  5 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath24 km s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 and @xmath25 = 0.0 . also , all wavelengths and redshifts reported here are heliocentric , but in this direction heliocentric and lsr velocities are nearly identical . at 16.5 km",

    "pg 0953 + 415 was observed with stis on 1998 december 4 and 1998 december 11 resulting in a total integration time of 24478 seconds .",
    "the observations were obtained with the medium resolution fuv echelle mode",
    "( e140 m ) with the 0.2@xmath270.2  aperture .",
    "kimble et al . (",
    "1998 ) report that this stis mode provides a resolution of @xmath28 = 46000 ( fwhm @xmath29 7 km s@xmath4 ) with the 0.2@xmath270.06  slit . with the 0.2@xmath270.2  slit , the fwhm is nearly identical but the broad wings of the line spread function are stronger ( see figure 13.87 in the cycle 9 stis instrument handbook ) .",
    "photoevents were recorded by the fuv - mama detector in accumulation mode with on - board orbital doppler compensation , and individual exposures ranged from 2215 to 2880 seconds in duration .",
    "short exposures of a wavelength calibration lamp were obtained with each individual observation of the qso .",
    "the data were reduced with the software developed by the stis instrument definition team ( idt ) .",
    "pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations in the individual exposures were first corrected with a postlaunch flatfield , and then the individual images were aligned by cross - correlation and then coadded .",
    "to prolong the lifetime of the mama detector , the position of the dispersed spectrum on the detector is changed every few weeks .",
    "this was done between the first observation of pg 0953 + 415 and the second , which is beneficial because when the data are aligned and coadded , any residual fixed - pattern noise not adequately removed by the flatfield is reduced .",
    "this also enables the identification of spurious features by comparison of the wavelength - calibrated spectra obtained on the two occasions .",
    "after coaddition of the individual images , the scattered light correction described by bowers and lindler ( 1999 ) was applied .",
    "then the spectra from each order were extracted with a simple unweighted slit with the standard height of 11 `` lores '' pixels , and smoothing of the background region also followed standard procedures for the stis echelle modes . during the extraction , obviously hot pixels were fixed by interpolation between the adjacent pixels in the dispersion direction .",
    "the wavelength scale was computed with a postlaunch dispersion relation ( which is updated when the position of the spectrum on the detector is changed ) and put on a heliocentric basis .",
    "finally , the data were flux calibrated and overlapping regions of adjacent orders were coadded with weighting based on signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage is @xmath31150 - 1730   with 5 small gaps between orders at @xmath30 1630  .",
    "samples of the final spectrum are shown in figure  [ specsample ] .",
    "we identify the lines at 1178.8 and 1185.3   as the @xmath311032,1038 doublet at @xmath0  = 0.14232 , and the corresponding ly@xmath2  line is well - detected at 1388.7  .",
    "a marginal absorption line is apparent at the expected wavelength of ly@xmath32 as well , but it is recorded in a region where the spectrum is quite noisy .",
    "note that the ly@xmath2  profile shows several components , the strongest of which is well - aligned with the lines .",
    "there are no convincing alternative identifications of these lines .",
    "they are unlikely to be due to the ism of the milky way since there are no resonance absorption lines at these wavelengths ( see morton 1991 ) .",
    "the lines at 1178.8 and 1185.3   can not be ly@xmath33 or @xmath34 lines due to extragalactic absorption systems at different redshifts because the corresponding ly@xmath2  lines are not detected at the expected wavelengths .",
    "similarly , we have searched for alternative metal line identifications at other redshifts , and we find no convincing candidates .    since the doublet was recorded in a spectral region which is relatively noisy , and since there are slightly hot spurious pixels apparent in this portion of the spectrum ( see figure  [ specsample ] ) , we inspected the spectra obtained on december 4 and december 11 independently to confirm that the lines are real .",
    "both lines are detected in the individual december 4 and december 11 spectra , and the relative line depths and wavelength difference of the lines are consistent with the identification . however , we noticed that the @xmath35 line is broader in the december 4 spectrum than the december 11 spectrum . for the reader s inspection , figure  [ compare ] compares the @xmath71037.6 profiles derived from the 1998 december 4 and 1998 december 11 data and from all of the data combined .",
    "we suspect that the 1037.6   line is broader in the december 4 spectrum due to noise , perhaps due to fixed pattern noise which was not adequately removed by the flatfield available when the data were reduced .",
    "of course , this impacts the final spectrum as well , and the 1037.6   line is broader than the 1031.9   line in the final spectrum shown in figure  [ specsample ] , though the magnitude of the discrepancy is reduced .",
    "it is alternatively possible that the @xmath71031.9 line is artificially narrow due to noise or an unrecognized warm pixel which fills in the profile somewhat  we can not rule out or favor any of these possibilities with the current stis data . consequently , we provide below results from measurement of the 1031.9   line only as well as results from measurement of both lines .      as part of our continuing study of the relationship between low @xmath11",
    "ly@xmath2  absorbers and galaxies ( see tripp , lu , & savage 1998 ) , we have also measured the redshifts of galaxies in the @xmath36 field centered on pg 0953 + 415 with the fiber - fed multiobject spectrograph ( hydra , see barden & armandroff 1995 ) on the wiyn telescope . the observations and measurement techniques",
    "are described in tripp et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and the new redshifts will be provided in a subsequent paper . here",
    "we note that this survey has revealed four galaxies within @xmath3130 km s@xmath4  of the absorber at @xmath0  = 0.14232 .",
    "the measured redshifts of these galaxies are summarized in table  [ galtab ] along with some of their properties including projected distance from the sight line ( @xmath37 ) , velocity displacement from the absorber , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 magnitudes from the revised aps digitization of the poss i plates ( pennington et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we also list @xmath40 magnitudes calculated using the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath40 derived by odewahn & aldering ( 1995 ) and the corresponding absolute magnitudes in table  [ galtab ] . these are all luminous galaxies ranging from 0.6@xmath6 to 4.0@xmath6 ( assuming @xmath42 = 19.5 from loveday et al .",
    "the velocity dispersion of this group is very uncertain since we do not know the redshift of the group center of mass and because of the small sample .",
    "however , if we assume that the absorption arises at the center of mass of the group , then the radial velocity dispersion is roughly 100 km s@xmath4 , consistent with typical values observed in poor groups ( e.g. , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) .",

    "figure  [ nav ] shows that there appears to be a small velocity difference between the centroid of the strongest component of the profile and that of the line . however , the and velocities from profile fitting agree within their 1@xmath66 uncertainties .",
    "more importantly , figure  [ nav ] shows that the main component of the profile is broader than the 1031.9   line , which suggests that the line widths are ( at least partially ) controlled by thermal motions ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "however , it is alternatively possible that the two strongest components of the profile include contributions from narrow features which are not detected in the line .",
    "such additional narrow lines , if present , are not well - constrained by the current data .",
    "we now turn to the physical conditions of the absorbing gas . as discussed in  1 , we are especially interested in testing the warm / hot gas prediction of cosmological simulations of structure growth . for this purpose",
    "we seek to constrain the gas temperature in  4.1 , and we examine the ionization mechanism in  4.2 .      if the line broadening is entirely due to thermal motions , then the gas temperature can be determined from the doppler parameter of a given line , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass and @xmath69 is the atomic mass number of the element , the doppler parameter @xmath54 is in km s@xmath4 , and @xmath70 is in @xmath71k .",
    "however , it is usually true that additional factors such as gas turbulence or multiple unresolved components contribute to the width of a line , and consequently the gas temperature from equation ( 2 ) must be treated as an upper limit . if lines of two or more elements with adequately different masses are available , then @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath72 which can be solved for @xmath70 and @xmath73 , the component of the broadening due to non - thermal motions , assuming the different absorption lines arise in the same gas and that the non - thermal motions ( turbulence ) can be assumed to have a gaussian profile .",
    "the temperature upper limits implied by equation ( 2 ) and the doppler parameters in table  [ compprop ] are @xmath70 ( ) @xmath74k and @xmath70 ( ) @xmath75k for the strongest component of the profile , which is also the closest component to the line in velocity space ( see figure  [ nav ] ) . since the velocity centroids of the and the are quite close and , in fact , in agreement within the 1@xmath66 error bars , it is plausible that these and lines originate in the same gas .",
    "adopting this assumption , we derive from equation ( 3 ) @xmath70 = @xmath76k and @xmath73 = 18 km s@xmath4 .",
    "while such low temperatures clearly favor photoionization ( see below ) , we must bear in mind that there are considerable uncertainties in the doppler parameters .",
    "for example , for the strongest component of the profile , increasing the @xmath54-value in table  [ compprop ] by just 1@xmath66 increases the upper limit on @xmath70 ( ) to @xmath77k , much closer to the temperature range where can be produced by collisional ionization .",
    "this issue is exacerbated by the non - uniqueness of the fitted profile when dealing with multiple blended components , i.e. , assuming a different number of components or a different mix of broad and narrow components can lead to substantially different @xmath54-values .",
    "we provide an example of this in  4.2.2 .",
    "it is also possible that the absorption arises in non - equilibrium collisionally ionized gas in which cooling is faster than recombination ( see  4.2.2 ) .",
    "given the measurements in the previous sections , can we favor photoionization or collisional ionization in this absorber ?",
    "in the milky way ism , likely traces collisionally ionized hot gas ( jenkins 1978a , b ) , at least in the disk and lower halo .",
    "however , in extragalactic absorbers , the euv ionizing radiation field may be substantially harder , and the absorption might arise in very low density gas with a long path length .",
    "both of these factors make photoionization more viable in the extragalactic case .",
    "we first consider the plausibility of photoionized models (  4.2.1 ) , and then we test the collisional scenario (  4.2.2 ) .      we have explored the photoionized scenario using cloudy ( version 90.04 ; ferland et al .",

    "for example , the characteristic ly@xmath2  absorber `` size '' inferred from close qso pairs is several hundred kpc at moderate redshifts ( e.g. , dinshaw et al .",
    "1995 ; fang et al .",
    "1996 ) , and this is consistent with cosmological simulations of structure formation ( e.g. , rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz 1997 ; dav et al .",
    "however , as various authors have argued on different grounds , these large absorbers are likely filamentary structures composed of smaller clouds rather than a single monolithic gas cloud ( e.g. , rauch , weymann , & morris 1996 ; cen & simcoe 1997 ) .",
    "cen & simcoe report that individual clouds have sizes of @xmath350 kpc .",
    "therefore the path length required by the photoionized model , @xmath95 25 kpc , is reasonable .",
    "the low densities inferred for the absorber at @xmath0  = 0.14232 are also consistent with cosmological simulations : according to equation ( 2 ) in dav et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the strongest component of the @xmath0  = 0.14232 absorber is expected to have @xmath96 @xmath88 based on its measured column density .",
    "such low densities are also possible in the outer halo of a galaxy like the milky way .",
    "murali ( 2000 ) has recently argued that the existence of the magellanic stream requires @xmath97 @xmath88 in the milky way halo at a galactocentric distance of @xmath350 kpc .",
    "evidently , the size and density of this absorber inferred from the photoionized model are plausible .",
    "the most problematic property of the photoionized model is the required metallicity , @xmath98 .",
    "most environments in which high metallicities are expected should involve collisional ionization or else should have substantially higher column densities . if we use expression ( 7 ) from dav et al .",

    "based on this overdensity , the cosmological simulations of cen & ostriker ( 1999b ) predict that the metallicity of this absorber should be @xmath100 . similarly , to produce the absorption in a high metallicity region of the ism of a galaxy like the milky way",
    ", the column density would have to be substantially higher than the observed @xmath56 ( ) .",
    "we note that the h@xmath101 recombination timescale , @xmath102h@xmath103 where @xmath104 is the recombination coefficient , exceeds the age of the universe by a factor of several at such low densities , and one may wonder if modeling the gas with a photoionization equilibrium code is valid .",
    "however , the timescale for the gas to approach equilibrium , @xmath105^{-1}$ ] where @xmath106 is the photoionization timescale ( see appendix a in dove & shull 1994 ) , is vastly shorter than the recombination timescale in the conditions considered here , and photoionization equilibrium is a good approximation for the low density , highly ionized gas ( see , e.g. , vedel , hellsten , & sommer - larsen 1994 ) .",
    "a caveat in the photoionization models above is that we have assumed the solar [ n / o ] abundance .",
    "if instead we assume [ n / o ] @xmath3 1.5 based on the trend of [ n / o ] vs. metallicity observed in giant extragalactic regions ( vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ) , then the lower limit on @xmath56()/@xmath56 ( ) is satisfied at a lower ionization parameter : the model requires log @xmath107 1.90 .",

    "similarly , the fos upper limit on @xmath56 ( ) can be used to set tighter constraints on the photoionized model in this case : the @xmath56()/@xmath56 ( ) limit requires log @xmath107 1.33 and @xmath109 @xmath88 .",
    "we next consider whether the gas could be collisionally ionized . in ",
    "4.1 we derived @xmath110k for the gas giving rise to the main component of the profile ( the component at @xmath111 0 km s@xmath4 ) . according to the collisional ionization equilibrium calculations of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) , no is produced by collisional ionization at this temperature , and in fact is the dominant ionization stage of oxygen .",
    "if we assume that the and absorption lines arise in the same gas with the same turbulent broadening , we obtain @xmath70 = 3.9 @xmath112k , which makes collisional ionization seem rather unlikely",
    ". however , the absorber could be out of ionization and thermal equilibrium or it could be a multiphase medium , possibilities which are discussed below .",
    "furthermore , as noted in  4.1 , there are substantial uncertainties in the @xmath54-values , and the doppler parameter is consistent with gas having @xmath113k at the 3@xmath66 level . from the doppler parameter",
    "we obtain @xmath114k .",
    "these temperatures are more in line with collisionally ionized gas .",
    "furthermore , it is entirely possible that the profile contains a broad component at @xmath115 0 km s@xmath4  superposed on a more narrow component . to demonstrate this",
    ", we show in figure  [ broaddemo ] two independent fits to the ly@xmath2  line .",
    "the model profile indicated with a solid line is the initial best fit which has the profile parameters summarized in table  [ compprop ] .",
    "the model profile plotted with a dotted line used a very similar initial guess at the component parameters but was forced to include an additional component with the same velocity as the line and @xmath54 = 76 km s@xmath4 , the doppler parameter of in gas with @xmath116k and no turbulent broadening .",
    "the two profile fits are nearly indistinguishable  by adjusting the parameters of the other components , the profile fitting code is able to compensate for the presence of the broad component to produce a very similar final result .",
    "the final column density required by the profile fitting software for the broad hot component is @xmath56 ( ) = 1.4 @xmath117 @xmath59 .",
    "unless the spectrum has very good s / n , it would be easy to miss such a broad hot component .",
    "therefore we can not rule out the possibility that the gas is collisionally ionized on the basis of the ly@xmath2  profile properties .",
    "figure  [ broaddemo ] is not shown in order to claim that such a broad component is present , but rather to show that it is allowed by the data . however",
    ", this exercise clearly shows that if the absorption occurs in hot gas with @xmath118k , then the absorber must be a multiphase medium because cooler gas is required to account for the rest of the ly@xmath2  absorption including much of the absorption centered at @xmath119 0 km s@xmath4 . given sufficient sensitivity , metal lines such as @xmath7977.02 and @xmath71206.50 should be detectable in these cooler phases , but",
    "this may require substantial improvement over the current signal - to - noise due to the low column densities .",
    "we next examine the high ion column density ratios predicted for collisionally ionized hot gas .",
    "several useful high ion column density ratios from the collisional ionization equilibrium calculations of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) are plotted as a function of gas temperature in figure  [ coll ] . from this figure",
    "we see that if the gas is in collisional ionization _ equilibrium _ , then @xmath70 must be greater than @xmath120k to satisfy the lower limit on @xmath56()/@xmath56 ( ) , assuming [ n / o ] = 0 . if [ n / o ] = 1.5 , then @xmath121k .",
    "these are plausible temperatures as discussed above .",

    "consequently , it may be more appropriate to compare the observed ratios to non - equilibrium calculations such as cooling fountain and cluster flow models ( e.g. , edgar & chevalier 1986 ; benjamin & shapiro 2000 ) . table  [ noneq ] compares the observed lower limits on the / , / , and / column density ratios in the @xmath0  = 0.14232 absorber to the ratios predicted by non - equilibrium collisionally ionized models including the cooling fountain calculation of benjamin & shapiro ( 2000 ) , the cluster cooling flow model of edgar & chevalier ( 1986 ) , the turbulent mixing layer model of slavin , shull , & begelman ( 1993 ) , and the magnetized thermal conduction interface modeled by borkowski , balbus , & fristrom ( 1990 ) . from this table we see that the cooling fountain and conductive interface models are fully consistent with the current observational constraints on this absorber given the right choice of model parameters .",
    "the turbulent mixing layer is marginally inconsistent with the / limit , but this should be confirmed with higher sensitivity observations of @xmath56 ( ) .",
    "however , we note that if the turbulent mixing layer post - mixing gas temperature is increased , then the model ironically becomes inconsistent with the / limit as well , presumably due to increased production of by self - photoionization .",
    "given the available observational data , it is difficult to definitively constrain the ionization mechanism . it would be interesting to search for the @xmath31 770.41 , 780.32 doublet in absorbers . from figures  [ photo ] and  [ coll ]",

    "= 0.14232 is inadequate , and the doublet is unobservable in this system .",
    "it is possible to look for the @xmath31 933.38 , 944.52 doublet at @xmath0  = 0.14232 with _",
    "fuse_. however , in most models this doublet is predicted to be substantially weaker than the lines ( see figures  [ photo ] and  [ coll ] and table  [ noneq ] ) .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0  = 0.14232 absorption line system is associated with a group of galaxies strongly indicates that the absorber is an _ intervening _ system rather than an _ intrinsic _ absorber which was ejected or somehow accelerated to high displacement velocity by the qso . while this may seem a trivial conclusion since the is displaced from the qso redshift by @xmath323,000 km s@xmath4 , during the last few years observations of absorption variability",
    "have established that some highly ionized intrinsic qso absorbers are separated from @xmath21 by such large velocities ( e.g. hamann , barlow , & junkkarinen 1997 ) and yet are relatively narrow ( i.e. , not traditional broad absorption line outflows ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to find evidence that a given absorber is indeed intervening even if @xmath124 is large . of course",
    ", this association with a galaxy group does not necessarily indicate that the absorption arises in the intragroup medium ; it could be due to gas within one of the galaxies in the group .",
    "we briefly discuss some possibilities below .",
    "the close proximity of the system to a galaxy group provides a theoretical prejudice in favor of collisional ionization .",
    "the presence of galaxies requires that intergalactic gas has collapsed in this region of space , and simple arguments ( e.g. ,  3 in cen & ostriker 1999a ) suggest that substantial shock - heating probably occurred as a result . therefore collisionally ionized gas is expected in the vicinity ( if not along the pencil - beam probed by the qso ) .",
    "it is interesting that this absorption system and associated galaxies fit the prediction of mulchaey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) discussed in  1 : a group which is possibly spiral - rich and has associated absorption , as expected based on their postulated collisionally ionized intragroup medium .",
    "however , we really are not sure that this is a spiral - rich group ( or even a bound group ) with only four known galaxies , and it is also possible that the absorption arises in the gaseous halo of a single galaxy",
    ". however , models of galaxy gaseous halos ( e.g. , mo & miralda - escud 1996 ) also usually produce absorption in a collisionally ionized hot phase .",
    "similarly , models which produce qso absorption line gas in supernova - driven winds from dwarf galaxies ( e.g. wang 1995 ) also involve substantial shock - heating and collisionally ionized gas .",
    "the kinematics of the absorption also provide useful information about the possible origins of the system at @xmath0  = 0.14232 .",
    "a fundamental question is whether the absorption is due to the intragroup medium or to the ism of a single galaxy that happens to intercept the line - of - sight .",
    "the ly@xmath2   profile has the `` leading edge asymmetry '' that various authors ( e.g. , lanzetta & bowen 1992 ) have discussed as the signature of a moderately edge - on rotating disk .",
    "of course , this is not a unique interpretation of such profile asymmetry , but it provides some evidence in favor of the single - galaxy interpretation .",
    "the simplicity of the profile also favors this interpretation .",
    "the velocity dispersion of poor galaxy groups is typically one to a few hundred km s@xmath4   ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) , so one might expect the to be spread over a larger velocity range if the absorption is due to the intragroup medium . here",
    ", though , we must recognize that the observed profiles are noisy and we only detect at the velocity of the _ strongest _ component of the profile .",
    "if the hot gas is concentrated at the center of the group , then this may be the only location along the line - of - sight where we have sufficient sensitivity to detect it , and there may be absorption at other velocities which has fallen below our detection threshold . to sort out the various possibilities , it would be very helpful to obtain additional stis observations to improve the signal - to - noise and search for at other velocities .",
    "one means to test the warm / hot gas prediction of cosmological simulations (  1 ) is to compare the number of absorbers observed per unit redshift , @xmath13 , to the number statistically predicted from many random pencil - beams through the cosmological simulations .",
    "is the observed @xmath13 consistent with the number predicted by the cosmological models ?",
    "we can also estimate the mean cosmological mass density traced by the systems at low @xmath11 .    for these purposes ,",
    "we combine the stis observations of pg0953 + 415 with the ghrs observations of h1821 + 643 from tripp et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the manner in which these qsos were selected should not bias the sample to enhance the number of systems detected compared to sampling many random directions . both qsos",
    "were originally observed to study the relationship between weak ly@xmath2   clouds and galaxies program ids 6155 and 7747 , see tripp et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for details . ] at @xmath9 0.3 .",
    "these two objects were selected for this project simply because they are among the brightest known qsos with @xmath125 0.2 , criteria which were required to substantially increase the sample of _ weak _ ly@xmath2  absorbers with a minimal amount of _ hst _ time .",
    "no consideration was given to factors which might indicate an enhanced likelihood of detecting the doublet when the targets were selected .",
    "to estimate @xmath13 of the systems , we define a sample of lines with @xmath8 60 m  for both lines of the doublet , detection limit throughout the region where o vi absorbers can be detected is 60 m  or better in the spectrum of pg0953 + 415 and 50 m  or better in the spectrum of h1821 + 643 . ] and set the maximum absorber redshift , @xmath126 , for each sight line to exclude any absorbers within @xmath127 5000 km s@xmath4  of the qso redshift and thereby avoid contaminating the sample with associated / intrinsic absorbers which are close to the qso .",
    "one might argue that 5000 km s@xmath4  is insufficient ( see above ) .",
    "however , we find that the two systems in the final sample are associated with galaxy groups , which suggests that these are indeed intervening absorbers .",
    "the lower redshift cutoff for each sight line , @xmath128 , was determined by the lowest wavelength in the observed spectrum ( with a small buffer to ensure that a line would be recognized if at that @xmath7 ) in the case of h1821 + 643 and by the wavelength at which the s / n is unacceptably low in the case of pg0953 + 415 .",
    "these criteria resulted in a sample of two absorbers within a total redshift path of @xmath10 = 0.100 ( after a significant correction of 0.067 for regions of the spectra in which we can not detect either of the lines because they would be blocked by strong ism or extragalactic lines from other redshift systems ) . therefore ,",

    "this comparison with the @xmath13 derived from fos data must be interpreted carefully , however , because the fos samples are dominated by lines which are substantially stronger and at substantially higher redshifts than the absorbers discussed in this paper . with a larger sample of low @xmath11 weak absorbers and smaller uncertainties in their number density , comparison of @xmath13 to the space density of objects such as",

    ". to show how @xmath60 ( ) depends on @xmath70 and @xmath85 , we operated cloudy in a different mode than that employed in  4.2.1 : instead of allowing cloudy to determine the gas temperature given the various heating and cooling processes which are important ( as was done in  4.2.1 ) , we fixed the temperature and ionization parameter at particular values in each grid cell and calculated the ensuing @xmath60 ( ) for a grid with 3.0 @xmath159 log @xmath160 7.0 and 3.5 @xmath159 log @xmath161 0.5 .",
    "the resulting grid is shown in figure  [ o6frc ] .    as expected based on previous calculations , when the ionization parameter is low enough so",
    "that photoionization is unimportant and only has a significant ionization fraction in gas which is hot enough to be collisionally ionized , figure  [ o6frc ] shows that @xmath60 ( ) has a maximum value of @xmath30.2 at log @xmath70 = 5.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the ionization parameter is high and photoionization dominates , figure  [ o6frc ] indicates that @xmath60 ( ) could be somewhat larger _ if the gas is very cool_. however , this is rather unlikely to occur because the photoionization by the uv background which creates the will also heat the gas to log @xmath162 4 .",
    "for example , the cloudy model in figure  [ photo ] which satisfies the and constraints requires log @xmath162 4.5 ( see  4.2.1 ) , and with this temperature constraint the maximum @xmath60 ( ) is 0.28 .",
    "therefore @xmath60 ( ) = 0.2 is a reasonable value for placing a lower limit on the baryonic content of absorbers regardless of whether the gas is photoionized or collisionally ionized .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of an absorption system at @xmath0  = 0.14232 in a high resolution fuv spectrum of pg 0953 + 415 obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) . </S>",
    "<S> both lines of the @xmath1 1032 , 1038 doublet and multicomponent ly@xmath2  absorption are detected , but the doublet and the strong lines of and are not apparent . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the ionization mechanism of the absorber and find that while theoretical considerations favor collisional ionization , it is difficult to observationally rule out photoionization . if the absorber is collisionally ionized , it may not be in equilibrium due to the rapid cooling of gas in the appropriate temperature range . non - equilibrium collisionally ionized models are shown to be consistent with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> a wiyn survey of galaxy redshifts near the sight line has revealed a galaxy at a projected distance of 395 kpc separated by @xmath3130 km s@xmath4  from this absorber , and three additional galaxies are found within @xmath5 130 km s@xmath4  of this redshift with projected separations ranging from 1.0 mpc to 3.0 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> all of these galaxies are luminous ( 0.6  4.0 @xmath6 ) , and two of them show the [ ] @xmath73727 emission line indicative of active star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies with [ ] emission are probably normal spirals . combining the stis observations of pg0953 + 415 with previous high signal - to - noise observations of h1821 + 643 with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , we find two systems with @xmath8 60 m   and @xmath9 0.3 over a total redshift path @xmath10 of only 0.10 . both of these qsos were originally observed to study the low @xmath11 ly@xmath2  lines and should not be biased in favor of detection . if these sight lines are representative , they imply a large number of absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath12 20 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding value of @xmath13 for low @xmath11 ly@xmath2  lines with @xmath8 50 m  is @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we use this sample to obtain a first estimate of the cosmological mass density of the systems at @xmath15 0 . </S>",
    "<S> if further observations confirm the large @xmath13 derived for the systems , then these absorbers trace a significant reservoir of baryonic matter at low redshift . </S>"
