    "the macho project is a dedicated search for galactic dark matter in the form of massive compact halo objects ( or machos ) using a gravitational microlensing technique @xcite . by photometrically monitoring millions of stars in the lmc , we are able to detect rare instances of gravitational microlensing .",
    "microlensing occurs when a dark object , such as a faint star or a macho , comes close enough to the line of sight to one of our target stars in the lmc so that the gravitational field of the dark object magnifies the star by a significant amount ( typically a factor of 2 or more ) .",
    "the macho team has recently completed analysis of data for 8.5 million stars spanning 2.1 years of observations @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this data has revealed 8 candidate microlensing events with timescales in the range @xmath3 .",
    "the probability that a single target star will be magnified by more than a factor of 1.34 is commonly referred to as the microlensing optical depth , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 is a particularly useful measure of the  amount \" of microlensing because it is proportional to the total mass in lensing objects and independent of the masses and velocities of the lenses .",
    "( it does depend on the spacial distribution of the lenses , however . ) the macho data gives a microlensing optical depth in events with an einstein diameter crossing time @xmath5 of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be compared to the predicted microlensing background due to lensing by known stellar populations of @xmath1 and the microlensing optical depth of a standard halo model consisting entirely of machos : @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that perhaps half of the mass of the  standard \" dark halo of our galaxy is composed of machos which give rise to lensing events with @xmath7days .",
    "the observed timescales imply a typical macho mass of @xmath8 , but this is somewhat model dependent .",
    "the simplest explanation of these microlensing results is that a significant fraction of the galactic halo is composed of white dwarfs .",
    "the remainder of the dark halo could be in more massive machos which give rise to longer events , or it could be in some form other than machos .",
    "for some  non - standard \" halo models it is even possible that the halo is composed entirely of machos of mass @xmath9 .",
    "one difficulty with the microlensing dark matter search technique is that the distance and mass of the lens can not generally be determined on on an event - by - event basis . for most events , all information on the distance , velocity , and mass of the lens",
    "is folded into a single measurable parameter , the event timescale @xmath10 .",
    "this is why the lensing by known populations of stars in the galactic disk and the lmc can not usually be distinguished from lensing by halo objects on an event - by - event basis .",
    "thus , the main argument indicating that there is a previously undiscovered population of machos in the halo is the excess observed number of events and optical depth over the predicted lensing background .    for certain types of exotic microlensing events",
    "additional parameters can be measured that can help lift the degeneracy .",
    "one example is a parallax event in which the lightcurve shows an asymmetry due to the orbital motion of the earth @xcite .",
    "a parallax event lightcurve fit provides an estimate of the transverse velocity of the lens projected to the position of the solar system .",
    "we can then use our knowledge of the velocity distributions in our galaxy to make a lens distance estimate good to about 30% .",
    "single @xcite or binary @xcite lensing events in which a caustic crossing occurs can also be used to estimate the distance to the lens .",
    "the intrinsic lightcurve shape at a caustic crossing is so highly peaked that the actual width of the caustic crossing lightcurve is determined by the angular size of the source star .",
    "the observed caustic crossing time can be compared to the known angular size of the source star to obtain a projected transverse velocity , and this can be used to make a distance estimate .",
    "figure  [ fig_lmc_binary ] shows the lightcurve of the lmc binary event as well as a closeup of the lightcurve along with the best fit binary lens lightcurve .",
    "there are many more data points in our blue band than in our red band for two reasons .",
    "first , the mt .",
    "stromlo 50 \" telescope has a equatorial german mount that allows us to observe from both sides of the pier . for east of pier observations ,",
    "this star falls on a non - functional region of one of our ccd s in the red focal plane .",
    "in addition , for the west of pier observations this star often falls on or near a previously undetected ccd trap which smears the flux along a ccd column . we have removed all red data in which this bad column comes within 6 pixels and 1.5 times the psf fwhm of the source star from the plot shown in figure  [ fig_lmc_binary ] . due to the extreme crowding of stellar images in this field , however , it is possible that this procedure does not remove all the red observations which might be contaminated .",
    "a dual color binary microlensing lightcurve is described by 11 parameters .",
    "two parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , describe the unlensed brightness of the lensed star in each color band , and in the crowded fields in which we work , we also need two parameters ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) to describe the flux of unlensed stars that may be superimposed on the same resolving element as the lensed star .",
    "three of the intrinsic microlensing parameters are the same as the parameters for a single lens .",
    "these are : the einstein diameter crossing time for the total mass , @xmath10 , the time of closest approach , @xmath15 , between the angular positions of the lens center of mass and the source star , and the distance of closest approach , @xmath16 , which is measured in units of the einstein radius .",
    "there are three other intrinsic microlensing parameters which are unique to the binary lens : @xmath17 , the separation of the two lens masses in units of the einstein radius , the angle , @xmath18 , between the lens axis and the apparent motion of the source in the lens plane , and @xmath19 , the mass fraction of mass # 1 . ( @xmath20",
    "finally , the parameter which can allow us to learn more about the location of the lens is the time , @xmath21 , it takes for the source star to move by one stellar radius with respect to the angular position of the lens center of mass .    the formula for the lightcurve in terms of these parameters",
    "is well known @xcite but is rather complicated .",
    "we obtain the following fit parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26days , @xmath27days , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32days .",
    "the binary lens fit gives @xmath33 for 848 degrees of freedom or a reduced @xmath34 of 1.76 .",
    "( the best single lens fit gives a reduced @xmath34 of 6.03 . )",
    "the flux parameters have been normalized to give a total unlensed flux of 1 in each color band , and the unmagnified magnitudes of the lensed component are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that we must _ assume _ that the source star is a single star and not a close binary because we have only two observations on the caustic crossing feature .",
    "we have recently demonstrated the capability to predict caustic crossing events @xcite , so future caustic crossings can be observed much more frequently .",
    "it is the parameter @xmath21 that can potentially teach us more about the lensing event because it depends on the finite size of the source star . using the magnitudes of the lensed star , and assuming between 0.2 and 0.6 magnitudes of extinction in @xmath37 and an lmc distance modulus of 18.5",
    ", we estimate @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the star is an a7 - 8 main sequence star with a radius of @xmath39 . combining this with the observed @xmath21 value yields @xmath40 where @xmath41 is",
    "the transverse velocity of the lens with respect to the line of sight and @xmath42 is the ratio of the lens and source distances .",
    "figure  [ fig_lmc_binary ] shows the predicted @xmath43 distribution for lenses in the lmc disk and milky way halo with the measured @xmath43 also indicated . clearly , a lens in the lmc disk is prefered over a halo lens .",
    "in fact , the @xmath43 value seems to be somewhat smaller than expected for a lens in the lmc disk .",
    "this is , in fact , what one would expect if the source was a short period binary rather than a single star . roughly speaking",
    ", we can expect binaries with periods of less than a few hundred days to be separated by a distance much smaller than the einstein ring radius . from reference @xcite , we see that about 20% of late a star binaries have periods of less than 100 days . of these , about half will have a companion that is at least 25% as bright as the primary .",
    "thus , a reasonable a priori estimate of the fraction of caustic crossing events that will have a detectable binary source character is about 10% .",
    "if the source star is a single star , then the measured @xmath43 value is only marginally consistent with lensing by an lmc object . for a binary source , however , we would expect abnormally low values of @xmath43 for lenses in the lmc , the milky way halo , or even the milky way disk .",
    "thus , we need to determine if the source star is actually a binary in order to determine the location of the lens",
    ". it may be possible to accomplish this by obtaining a single spectrum of the source star because late a stars appear to have spectral peculiarities when they are in short period binary systems @xcite .",
    "this will be complicated by the fact that the source star is superimposed on a brighter unlensed source , but analysis of the image centroid motion during the lensing event indicates that the brighter companion is actually 0.3 \" away from the lensed star .",
    "thus , is possible to get a spectrum with hst that can determine whether the source star is likely to be a binary .",
    "now , let us assume that the source star is not a binary and consider the implications if the lens is actually in the lmc . it might be tempting to conclude that since the one lens that we can estimate the distance for appears to be in the lmc , perhaps lmc - lmc lensing might explain most or even all of the lensing events .",
    "this would require that the microlensing optical depth for lmc - lmc lensing be substantially in excess of the value we have used in our microlensing background calculations .",
    "as gould @xcite has shown , the self - lensing optical depth of a self - gravitating system is related to its velocity dispersion .",
    "for a nearly face on disk like the lmc , the relationship is @xmath46 where we have used @xmath47 as the inclination angle of the lmc disk .",
    "the @xmath44 distribution also depends on @xmath45 .",
    "the solid curve in figure  [ fig_vhat ] indicates the @xmath44 distribution for @xmath48km / s which is the measured value for ch stars @xcite . the dashed curve indicates the @xmath44 distribution for @xmath49km / s .",
    "clearly , @xmath50km / s is an unlikely value for such a high line of sight velocity dispersion .",
    "yet , the self - lensing optical depth for @xmath49km / s is still outside the 2-@xmath51 confidence interval of the measured microlensing optical depth .",
    "the relationship between @xmath45 , the self - lensing optical depth and the likelyhood of @xmath50km / s is summarized in table  [ tab_lmc ] .",
    "@xmath52 is just the relative likelyhood of @xmath50km / s compared to the most likely value for @xmath44 . only for @xmath53km / s",
    "is the self - lensing optical depth consistent with the 2-@xmath51 confidence interval on @xmath54 , but this gives a very small probability for the measured @xmath44 value . in this case , the most reasonable explanation for the small @xmath44 value is the possibility of a binary source as discussed above .",
    "however , if the source is a binary , then the argument favoring a lens in the lmc disappears .",
    "thus , if the lmc self - lensing optical depth is significantly smaller than @xmath54 , then there is some reason to suspect that the binary lens may reside in the lmc , but if lmc self - lensing is responsible for most of the total microlensing optical depth observed toward the lmc , then location of the lmc binary event can not be determined from the caustic crossing fit parameter .",
    "clearly , the lmc binary event lends no weight to the hypothesis that the lmc self - lensing optical depth is substantially larger than @xmath55 ( the value used for our lensing background calculations ) ."
