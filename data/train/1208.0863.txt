    "the evolution of cooperation and altruism are fundamental scientific challenges highlighted by their role in the major transitions in life s history , when natural selection acted simultaneously on several competing levels @xcite . in this context , the relevance of basic concepts , including group selection and hamilton s rule remain controversial @xcite . here",
    "we address these problems by studying a framework for evolution in group structured populations that incorporates inter- and intra - group competition and migration . combining group - centric with gene - centric perspectives in a constructive group / kin selection approach ,",
    "we build methodology that allows for the analysis of arbitrary non - linear fitness functions , resulting from complex multi - individual interactions across life cycles .",
    "we obtain the conditions for a rare social allele to invade the population .",
    "this is obtained in a mathematically rigorous way , by analyzing the stability of the equilibrium in which this allele is absent .",
    "this analysis is done for arbitrary strength of selection , but when selection is weak and groups are large the condition for invasion simplifies significantly into a form that is easy to apply and provides substantial intuition . in the case of linear fitness functions ,",
    "the condition for invasion is identical to hamilton s rule , and it is natural to regard the more general non - linear cases as generalizations of that rule . our results also show that one of the most widely used approaches to analyzing kin selection models , @xcite , @xcite ( condition ( 6.7 ) ) , and @xcite ( box 6 ) , yields incorrect results in some biologically relevant situations .",
    "our results reveal biologically realistic conditions under which altruism can evolve when rare , but genetic relatedness in groups is modest . in this way we challenge a common understanding according to which inter - group selection favoring altruism could only override intra - group selection favoring selfishness under exceptional conditions , namely small group size and very low migration rates @xcite .",
    "we identify the emphasis on linear public goods games in the literature , including most of these papers , as having supported this belief .",
    "in contrast , we show that for iterated public goods games , in which altruists cooperate or not in each round based on previous outcomes @xcite , altruism can spread even when groups are large , selection is weak and migration rates are substantially larger than the inverse of group size .",
    "this result corrects @xcite , who predicted that large group size would not allow cooperation to spread when rare in this model . for species that live in groups ,",
    "several vital group activities repeat themselves periodically and behavior changes as feedback is obtained from previous iterations .",
    "the iterated public goods game that we study is therefore often more realistic than a simple one shot public goods game .",
    "a proper analysis of this model fills therefore an important gap in the literature . to obtain our result",
    "we show that in the absence of selection , when groups are large , the fraction of group members that are close relatives of a randomly chosen individual has a non - gaussian distribution with a fat tail . as a consequence ,",
    "even when altruistic alleles are rare in the population , they have a significant probability of concentrating in some groups , accruing substantial reproductive gains through multi - individual synergy .",
    "when members of a species live in groups , their reproductive success depends on the behavior of all group members .",
    "more efficient groups may grow faster and split , outcompeting the less efficient ones that die out . on the other hand",
    ", individuals may free ride on the cooperation of other members of their group , and in this way outcompete them .",
    "this picture is further complicated by migration among groups . the _ two - level fisher - wright framework with selection and migration _ ( 2lfw ) captures all these elements , in a simplified fashion . in 2lfw haploid individuals",

    "the parameter @xmath10 indicates the strength of selection .",
    "[ fig1 ] describes the creation of a new generation in the 2lfw through inter- and intra- group competition , followed by migration at rate @xmath11 .",
    "cases in which types a behave in some altruistic fashion are of particular interest @xcite .",
    "most of the literature concerns the very special case of a _ linear _ public goods game ( pg ) , defined by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , in which each type a cooperates , at a cost @xmath15 to herself , providing a benefit @xmath16 shared by the other members of her group .",
    "the need to consider more complex intra - group interactions and non - linear payoff functions is , nevertheless , well known .",
    "non - linearities appear naturally whenever activities involve many group members simultaneously .",
    "they result from threshold phenomena , increasing returns to scale , saturation , etc .",
    "for instance , to hunt large prey may require a large minimum number of hunters , the likelihood of success may first increase rapidly with the number of hunters , but it may plateau when this number becomes very large . allowing for",

    "2.3.2 of @xcite ) , which corresponds to the case @xmath21",
    ". one can interpret @xmath22 as an assortment parameter . because migration is completely random in 2lfw",
    ", this assortment represents a worst case scenario , abstracting away additional assortment caused by kin recognition , greenbeard effects , selective acceptance of migrants , joint migration of individuals , etc .",
    "it is well known @xcite that even when @xmath21 non - linearities in fitness functions allow for coexistence of cooperators and defectors . but under the strong altruism condition",
    "@xmath23 ( meaning that each type a would be better off mutating into a type n ) , this is not the case @xcite .",
    "one of our goals is to determine the level of migration compatible with invasion by rare strong altruists .",
    "the 2lfw also generalizes the `` typical kin selection model '' of @xcite , where the payoffs were those of pg , and the analysis relied on this and on the assumption of weak selection . that paper was a response to @xcite , where group selection was argued to be an important mechanism for the evolution of cooperation , and a multilevel selection model based on moran s model was introduced .",
    "our analysis of 2lfw with non - linear fitness functions highlights the importance of combining group - centric with gene - centric perspectives , and shows that group selection can be an important force in evolution under realistic conditions .",
    "it also shows that mathematically rigorous analysis can be carried out even when selection is strong and fitness functions are non - linear . and",
    "it shows that one has to be very careful in applying mathematically non - rigorous methodology , as it can produce substantially incorrect results , even when selection is weak .",
    "non - linearities in life - cycle payoffs can result from activities repeating themselves during a lifetime , and behavior being contingent on previous outcomes .",
    "a basic example is the iterated public goods game ( ipg ) @xcite . in ipg",
    "a pg is repeated an average of @xmath24 times in a life - cycle .",
    "we will suppose that types n never cooperate , while types a cooperate in the first round and later cooperate only if at least a fraction @xmath25 of group members cooperated in the previous round .",
    "mathematically , this model generalizes the iterated prisoner dilemma and tit - for - tat , from the dyadic setting of @xcite and @xcite to the multi - individual setting .",
    "but while direct or indirect reciprocity requires the identification of individuals in the group , this is not the case here .",
    "the behavior of types a in the ipg can be triggered by individuals simply discontinuing cooperative behavior when previous cooperation produced negative feedback to them .",
    "in other words , allele a can predispose individuals to cooperate , but as they do it and obtain feedback from that behavior , they may continue it or discontinue it .",
    "the ipg is in this sense closely related to generalized reciprocity mechanisms @xcite with low cognitive requirements .",
    "negative feedback from cooperation should occur if the fraction of group members that cooperated was less than @xmath26 , but not if it was larger than that threshold , since in the former case the payoff to a cooperator is negative , while in the latter case it is positive .",
    "this gives a special role to the value @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , the behavior of types a is altruistic in the strong sense that each type a individual would increase its fitness if it behaved as a type n , everything else being equal , i.e. , @xmath29 ( see si appendix ( section 8) for a detailed discussion ) . moreover , types n always free ride and have greater fitness than types a in the same group , regardless of the values of @xmath25 and @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays a detailed analysis of some instances of the ipg , giving conditions for allele a to spread when rare . for many species that live and interact in groups for many years",
    ", several vital activities , including collective hunting and food sharing , can repeat themselves hundreds or thousands of times in a life - cycle , giving plausibility to the values of @xmath24 in fig .",
    "( the assumption that individuals discontinue behavior after a single unsuccessful participation is a simplification . when this is not a realistic assumption , one can interpret the parameter @xmath24 as the ratio between the typical number of repetitions of the activity and the typical number of unsuccessful attempts before cooperation is discontinued by a type a. ) panel c , in which selection is weak and groups are large , shows two important contrasting results .",
    "when @xmath31 , and the ipg is identical to the pg , allele a can only invade under hamilton s condition @xmath32 .",
    "but as @xmath24 increases , the level of relatedness needed for invasion drops substantially , so that for modest values of @xmath33 , allele a can invade under @xmath34 significantly lower than @xmath35 , compatible with levels observed in several species , including humans @xcite ( table 8.3 ) , @xcite , @xcite ( tables 6.4 and 6.5 ) , @xcite , @xcite ( table 4.9 ) . the corresponding number of migrants per group per generation , @xmath36 , can be of the order of 10 .",

( when @xmath62 , the migrant types a are a small fraction of the migrant population , and therefore each one is likely to settle in a different group that had no types a before migration . )",

    "when @xmath81 , even if allele a is initially absent , a small rate of mutation will introduce it , allowing it to then invade the population . in the terminology of evolutionary game theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite chapter 7 ) , phenotype n is an evolutionary stable strategy ( ess ) when @xmath82 and n is not an ess when @xmath81 .",
    "the viability condition @xmath81 has a gene - centric ( kin - selection ) interpretation in terms of average ( neighbor modulated ) fitnesses .",
    "for this purpose , define @xmath83",

    "the viability condition @xmath81 can also be stated as @xmath94 , in ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "it is important to observe that @xmath79 does not need to be monotone , and that @xmath94 is the proper condition for invasion only when , as in ( [ gen ] ) , one is considering the stationary regime , @xmath72 .",
    "if selection is weak , i.e. , @xmath95 , migration acts much faster than selection , providing a separation of time scales @xcite .",
    "this allows us to replace @xmath77 in ( [ gen ] ) with @xmath96 , obtained by assuming @xmath97 .",

    "the ibd distribution @xmath103 contains all the relevant information about genetic relatedness in the groups , including and exceeding that given by the average relatedness between group members , @xmath121 , obtained from lineages , regression coefficients , or wright s @xmath122 statistics .",
    "specifically , we can define @xmath123 as the probability that a second member chosen from the focal s group is ibd to the focal and then obtain ( from linearity of expected values ) that @xmath124 is a linear function of @xmath103 s first moment .",
    "when @xmath8 is a non - linear function of @xmath3 , more information contained in @xmath103 , including its higher moments , are needed to decide whether @xmath94 in ( [ ws ] ) .",
    "it is important to also stress that ( [ ws ] ) can be easily used for applications in which even the knowledge of all the moments of @xmath103 ( see @xcite ) would be cumbersome to apply , as for instance in the computation of the short horizontal red lines in fig .",

    "equation ( [ wsln ] ) should be contrasted with what @xcite predicted by supposing that the number of individuals in a group that are ibd to a focal individual would be well approximated by a binomial with @xmath117 attempts and probability @xmath123 of success .",
    "that would lead to a normal distribution , narrowly concentrated close to its mean @xmath123 , in place of the beta distribution above .",
    "our result reveals a strong dependency structure among lineages , producing the beta distribution , with a standard deviation comparable to its mean , and a tail that decays slowly compared to a gaussian distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "fitness functions that are large only when the fraction of types a in a group is above a threshold value , as in the ipg , will allow for proliferation of types a under levels of relatedness substantially lower than that predicted under the assumption in @xcite .",
