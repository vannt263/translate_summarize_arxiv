    "cosmological observations indicate that the universe accelerates positively at the small redshifts @xcite which leads to the so - called dark energy problem @xcite . in the standard @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "cosmological constant dominates at the late time and derives cosmic speed - up .",
    "but , the models in favor of cosmological constant clue to the cosmological constant problem due to the possible identification of the cosmological constant with the vacuum energy of the quantum fields @xcite . furthermore , increasing evidences from the cosmological data reveal that the energy density corresponds to the dark energy evolves very slowly in time and the associated equation of state parameter lies in a narrow strip around @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , cosmological constant with sharp value @xmath9 for the equation of state parameter is an appropriate candidate in the first order of approximation @xcite . in order to explain the dynamical nature of the dark energy ,",
    "the quintessence scenarios with @xmath10 and phantom models with @xmath11 are proposed . in this respect ,",
    "one usually interested in models which support the transition from the quintessence era to the phantom phase .",
    "these scenarios are usually based on two postulates : i ) assuming general relativity is applicable even on cosmological scales and then considering some sort of unusual matter component(s ) costing violation of some energy conditions , ii ) deformation of general relativity at the cosmological scales .",
    "for the first case the matter source is usually given by a scalar field @xcite and for the latter case , there are many candidates such as the extra dimensions models , @xmath12 theories @xcite and recently proposed massive gravity models @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , de sitter spacetime is a maximally symmetric space and its constant curvature is completely determined by the cosmological constant . apart from the very small variation of cosmological constant with time , it can be interpreted as a fundamental constant of nature much similar to the speed of light and planck constant .",
    "it therefore provides a universal infrared ( ir ) cutoff ( corresponding to the large length scale @xmath13 ) for the universe .",
    "for instance , existence of cosmological constant as an ir cutoff is essential for the quantization of scalar field in de sitter spacetime .",
    "more precisely , it provides a minimum scale for the momenta of modes through the uncertainty principle and removes the ir divergences in this setup @xcite . in this respect",
    "the uncertainty principle will be modified in curved spacetimes in order to respect the existence of cosmological constant as a universal ir cutoff @xcite . on the other hand , existence of a minimal length scale",
    "is suggested by any quantum theory of gravity such as loop quantum gravity @xcite and string theory @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the uncertainty principle is modified in the presence of a minimal length scale @xcite .",
    "thus , the uncertainty principle gets modifications in ir and ultraviolet ( uv ) regimes in order to respect the existence of cosmological constant and minimal length scale respectively @xcite . taking these universal ir and uv cutoffs into account , the quantum field theories turn out to be renormalizable @xcite .",
    "therefore , natural ir and uv cutoffs would be emerged in the context of ultimate quantum gravity theory . while the existence of a universal ir cutoff is supported by the standard general relativity framework through the de sitter spacetime ,",
    "there is not any explanation for the uv cutoff ( minimal length scale ) in this setup . on the other hand , a minimal length scale as a uv cutoff emerges in loop quantum gravity framework @xcite but there is not a well - defined explanation for taking a cosmological constant into account in this setup ( see however refs .",
    "@xcite where some attempts have done in this direction ) . in this paper , we follow the uv deformation of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe in loop quantum cosmology and we construct the corresponding ir - deformed case .",
    "we show that the late time cosmic acceleration arises in this setup which is significantly different from the @xmath0cdm model such that the universe crosses the phantom divide from @xmath5 to @xmath7 .",
    "the spatial part of the spatially flat flrw universe is 3-manifold @xmath14 with the euclidean isometry group and @xmath15 topology .",
    "one then can fix a constant orthonormal triad @xmath16 and a co - triad @xmath17 compatible with a flat fiducial metric @xmath18 on @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding gravitational phase space consists of pairs @xmath19 on @xmath14 , where @xmath20 is a @xmath21 connection and @xmath22 is its canonically conjugate field @xcite . because of the symmetries of the 3-manifold @xmath14 , all the information of the phase space variables @xmath19 are summarized in two variables @xmath23 which satisfy canonical poisson algebra @xmath24 on two - dimensional phase space @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( we work in unit @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the speed of light in vacuum ) and @xmath29 is the barbero - immirizi parameter which is fixed by the black hole entropy calculations in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "these variable are related to the old geometrodynamics variables as @xmath30 so , @xmath31 is the comoving volume and its canonically conjugate variable @xmath32 is ( up to a constant ) the hubble parameter .    considering a perfect fluid as a source for the matter content ,",
    "the associated energy density consisting of non - relativistic and relativistic matters will be a function of volume as @xmath33 and the corresponding hamiltonian function is given by @xmath34 the hamiltonian system of the flrw universe in terms of ashtekar variables @xmath23 is therefore defined by the relations ( [ spa ] ) and ( [ hamiltonian ] ) on two - dimensional phase space @xmath25 : the kinematics is defined by the poisson bracket ( [ spa ] ) and the dynamical evolution is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the associated hamilton s equations together with the hamiltonian constraint @xmath35 lead to the standard friedmann and raychaudhuri equations .      in loop quantum cosmology scenario",
    "however this hamiltonian system gets holonomy corrections at the uv regime . at the semiclassical regime",
    ", these uv effects can be taken into account in two equivalent ways on the corresponding uv - deformed phase space @xmath36 .",
    "one can work in noncanonical chart on @xmath36 in which the poisson bracket ( [ spa ] ) gets uv modification while the hamiltonian function ( [ hamiltonian ] ) retains its standard functional form @xcite .",
    "equivalently , one can also work in canonical chart on @xmath36 such that the form of poisson bracket ( [ spa ] ) remains unchanged and the hamiltonian function ( [ hamiltonian ] ) gets modified functional form @xcite .",
    "these two different representations are related to each other through the darboux transformation and lead to the same friedmann and raychaudhuri equations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we work in the first picture in which the poisson bracket gets uv modification as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the uv deformation parameter which is preferably of the order of the planck length @xmath39 . clearly , @xmath32 gets maximum value as @xmath40 in this setup .",
    "more precisely , the space of @xmath32 is compactified to a circle @xmath41 with radius @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the uv - deformed poisson algebra ( [ pa - uv ] ) implies the following modified hamilton s equations @xmath43 @xmath44 the above equations correctly reduce to the standard hamilton s equations in the limit of @xmath45 . substituting ( [ hamiltonian ] ) into ( [ eom - uv ] )",
    "gives @xmath46 using hamiltonian constraint @xmath35 and after some manipulations , it is straightforward to obtain the following uv - deformed friedmann equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hubble parameter and we have also defined @xmath49 .",
    "the energy density and the hubble parameter get maximum bounds @xmath50 and @xmath51 in this setup and the big bang singularity problem resolves such that the initial singularity in standard model of cosmology replaces with a bounce @xcite .",
    "existence of the minimal length scale as a uv cutoff for the system thus naturally leads to the spacetime singularity resolution in cosmological setup . in this paper",
    ", we are interested to study the effect of the existence of an ir cutoff on the late time cosmic acceleration in order to address the dark energy problem . as we will show in the next subsection , taking an ir cutoff into account leads to the self - accelerating universe at the late time .",
    "in the absence of a fundamental theory at the ir regime , we would like to construct an ir - deformed hamiltonian system following the way by which the uv cutoff is taken into account in the hamiltonian system of the flrw universe in loop quantum cosmology scenario . in loop quantum cosmology",
    "scenario , the space of @xmath52 is compactified to a circle @xmath41 which leads to the deformed friedmann equation ( [ friedmann - uv ] ) . for the case of the ir - deformed hamiltonian system",
    ", we should explore the modification of the space of @xmath31 . at the first glance",
    ", it seems that we should consider the modified @xmath41 geometry for the space of @xmath31 .",
    "but , let us more elaborate on this point . indeed , the uv and ir cutoffs are universal and therefore the space of the associated variable should be maximally symmetric @xcite . from the global point of view , for the case of one - dimensional space ( with which we are interested in this paper )",
    "there are only two possibilities : a circle @xmath41 with compact @xmath53 symmetry and a hyperbolic space @xmath54 with open @xmath55 symmetry . for the uv - deformed phase space ,",
    "the unique representation of holonomy - flux algebra fixes the space of @xmath32 to have @xmath53 symmetry which local coordinatization ( [ pa - uv ] ) @xcite . in the absence of any fundamental theory for the ir sector",
    ", we consider both of the possible symmetries @xmath53 and @xmath55 for the space of @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , inspired by the loop quantum cosmology scenario , we work with ashtekar variables and also consider the local coordinatization as same as ( [ pa - uv ] ) .",
    "we therefore lead to two possible ir - deformed poisson algebras @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the ir deformation parameter with dimension of inverse of volume . before applying the above ir - deformed poisson algebras to the cosmological setup ,",
    "let us more elaborate on the differences between these two ir - deformed models .",
    "for the case of minus sign , clearly there is a maximum value @xmath58 for the volume of the universe such that @xmath59 while @xmath60 for the case of plus sign . at the quantum level ,",
    "the model with minus sign should be defined on a lattice @xcite while the model with plus sign leads to the generalized uncertainty relation . following the way suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is straightforward to show that the associated uncertainty relation implies a minimum uncertainty in measurement of the corresponding conjugate variable @xmath32 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    taking the ir - deformed poisson algebras ( [ pa - ir ] ) into account ,",
    "the corresponding ir - deformed hamilton s equations are given by @xmath61 @xmath62 where a dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath63 . in the limit @xmath64 , the poisson algebra ( [ pa - ir ] ) and ir - deformed hamilton s equations ( [ eom - ir ] ) and ( [ eom - ir2 ] )",
    "are reduced to their standard counterparts . indeed , depending on the value of the deformation parameter @xmath57 ,",
    "the system continue to follow the standard non - deformed classical trajectories and deviations start to dominate for the sufficiently large scales : @xmath65 . substituting the hamiltonian function ( [ hamiltonian ] ) into the relation ( [ eom - ir ] ) and then using the hamiltonian constraint @xmath35",
    ", it is straightforward to show that the ir - modified friedmann equation will be @xmath66 differentiating the above relation with respect to time @xmath63 and then using the energy conservation relation @xmath67 which is not modified in this setup ( since just the geometric parts are modified ) , one can easily obtain the following ir - modified raychaudhuri equation @xmath68\\,.\\ ] ] the ir effects would become significant at large volume limit at the late time .",
    "we also expect that they would naturally address the late time cosmic acceleration . in order to understand the late time behaviors of the above ir - deformed models , we obtain the associated effective equation of state parameters . defining effective energy densities and pressures as @xmath69 and @xmath70 through the relations",
    "( [ friedmann0 ] ) and ( [ raychaudhuri0 ] ) , the effective equation of state parameters @xmath71 can be easily obtained as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the standard equation of state parameter .",
    "the above relation shows that @xmath74 since @xmath75 .",
    "this general result show that the minus sign in ( [ pa - ir ] ) can not generate the late time cosmic acceleration . invoking the cosmological observations which indicate that the universe accelerate at late time @xcite , we therefore abandon the minus sign . for the case of plus sign , however , we have @xmath76 $ ] when the volume changes as @xmath60 .",
    "this is an interesting result since it shows that the plus sign in ( [ pa - ir ] ) can potentially address the dark energy problem @xcite .",
    "in the next section we show that the late time cosmic acceleration naturally arises even in the cold dark matter dominated universe .",
    "we are interested in the late time cosmic evolution where the radiation component is negligible .",
    "also , we would like to address the dark energy problem in the presented setup .",
    "therefore , we consider the cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe without cosmological constant . in this respect ,",
    "our model has the same number of parameter as the standard @xmath0cdm model such that the effects of cosmological constant will replace with ir parameter @xmath57 .    considering the energy density @xmath77 for cdm in ( [ friedmann0 ] ) and ( [ raychaudhuri0 ] ) ( for the plus sign since we have shown that the minus sign can not produce acceleration ) ,",
    "the ir - deformed friedmann and raychaudhuri equations for the cdm dominated universe in this setup are given by @xmath78 @xmath79 where we have defined the minimum energy density @xmath80 the above minimum energy density is defined in the sense that at @xmath81 , the effective energy density @xmath82 has the minimum @xmath83 . the existence of this minimum value for the effective energy density implies a minimum value for the hubble parameter through the relation ( [ friedmann - ir ] ) ( see also the figure [ fig1 ] ) which is given by @xmath84     in this setup .",

    "the figure is plotted for @xmath85 . ]    before scrutinizing the cosmological implication of the model , it is interesting to note that the ir - deformed friedmann equation ( [ friedmann - ir ] ) can be also deduced from the @xmath12 theories for the particular case of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be realized from the cardassian models of dark energy which is investigated in the context of braneworld scenario @xcite . in cardassian model ,",
    "the deformed friedmann equation in matter dominated era is given by @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are two free parameters of the model .",
    "our model can be realized as a special case by the relevant identification @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that our model has also one parameter less than the cardassian models .    solving ( [ rho - total ] ) for @xmath93 and",
    "then substituting for the effective pressure @xmath94 gives @xmath95 the effective equation of state parameter is then given by @xmath96 from the minimum bound that are arisen for the effective energy density as @xmath97 , it is clear that the equation of state parameter ( [ eos ] ) is also bounded as @xmath98 in complete agreement with our pervious general treatment though the relation ( [ weff ] ) ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this range for @xmath99 shows that the model can produce the acceleration phase .",

    "it is clear that the pressure also diverges at the time ( [ time - br ] ) and therefore the universe finally ends up in a big rip with latexmath:[$\\rho_{_{\\rm eff } } ,    @xmath2 at the finite time ( [ time - br ] ) .",
    "a big rip is the common fate of the phantom dominated universe @xcite . at sufficiently high energy regime @xmath109 ,",
    "the ir effects are negligible and relation ( [ rho - total ] ) gives @xmath110 which is corresponding to the standard matter dominated era and therefore the standard friedmann and raychaudhuri equations for the matter dominated era can be recovered in this regime .",
    "note that fixing the ir deformation parameter of the model @xmath57 ( or equivalently fixing @xmath111 ) , which replaces the cosmological constant in comparison with the @xmath0cdm , immediately fixes all the observable parameters such as the equation of state parameter @xmath99 and density parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "thus , fitting the density parameter @xmath113 with the observational data immediately gives a fixed value for the effective equation of state parameter @xmath114 which shows the naturalness and predictiveness of the model .",
    "interestingly , the cases @xmath5 and @xmath7 are corresponding to @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively which shows the model is observationally viable .",
    "while the model qualitatively is relevant , in contrast to the dynamical dark energy models , it may not fit the observational data in a very precise manner .",
    "but , note that the dynamical dark energy models such as the model based on the scalar fields @xcite have at least one parameter more that our model and @xmath0cdm .",
    "we could therefore consider another model with more adjustable parameters which fits the observational data in a more precise manner .",
    "for instance , adding even a massless scalar field to the matter content can produce cosmological constant like term at late time in this setup .",
    "we are going to study such a setup in a new research program @xcite .",
    "moreover , similar to the theories which deals with the geometric deformation of the einstein s equations at the late time such as @xmath12 theories @xcite and recently proposed massive gravity models @xcite , our setup can produce an accelerating universe and crossing the phantom divide without violating any energy condition .",

    "<S> in this paper , inspired by the ultraviolet deformation of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker geometry in loop quantum cosmology , we formulate an infrared - modified cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the associated deformed friedmann and raychaudhuri equations and we show that the late time cosmic acceleration can be addressed by the infrared corrections . as a particular example , we applied the setup to the case of matter dominated universe . </S>",
    "<S> this model has the same number of parameters as @xmath0cdm , but a dynamical dark energy generates in the matter dominated era at the late time . according to our model , as the universe expands , the energy density of the cold dark matter dilutes and when the hubble parameter approaches to its minimum , the infrared effects dominate such that the effective equation of state parameter smoothly changes from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . interestingly and nontrivially , </S>",
    "<S> the unstable de sitter phase with @xmath3 is corresponding to @xmath4 and the universe crosses the phantom divide from the quintessence phase with @xmath5 and @xmath6 to the phantom phase with @xmath7 and @xmath8 which shows that the model is observationally viable . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the universe finally ends up in a big rip singularity for a finite time proportional to the inverse of the minimum of the hubble parameter . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we consider the dynamical stability of the model and we show that the universe starts from the matter dominated era at the past attractor with @xmath1 and ends up in a future attractor at the big rip with @xmath2 . + </S>",
