    "we find that @xmath21 is a werner state characterized by a single parameter @xmath22 .",
    "this result can be explained intuitively .",
    "in fact , because @xmath23 is conserved , the density matrix should interpolate between the completely random state and the singlet state .    in fig .",
    "[ werner ] we show the correlation function @xcite @xmath24 as function of @xmath7 , and the relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite@xmath25 where @xmath26 is a set of all separable states in the hilbert space in which @xmath27 is defined . also shown in fig .",
    "[ werner ] is the classical correlation  @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the reduced density matrices .",

    "we observe that the mixing factor , @xmath31 , can be approximated with a gaussian function @xmath32 with @xmath33 fm , see fig .",
    "1 . the mixing parameter , @xmath31 , can be measured experimentally .",

    "therefore , from experimental data @xcite one can extract the mixing parameter @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "also our mixing parameter can be extracted from coulomb dissociation of @xmath40 @xcite ( see forthcoming paper @xcite ) .",
    "from the above discussion it is clear that there are non - negligible spin quantum correlations effects in a nucleus .",
    "therefore ,  a natural question arises , namely , do these correlations play a role on the observables that depend on the spin of the nucleon pair ?",
    "we start our discussion by a calculation of this effect on the m1 transition strength .",
    "evidently , we expect that when two nucleons are in a singlet spin state the m1 transition is suppressed , or even forbidden , due to pauli blocking and the energy level structure .",
    "similar arguments were given in @xcite upon requiring that the recoiling nucleon lies outside the fermi sphere .",
    "the amount of singlet state is controlled by the factor @xmath31 , thus the number of the suppressed transitions should be proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "1 ) in order to have such effect on the m1 transition ]    however , we should not forget that the same correlation exists for all nucleons .",
    "this puts another constraint on the m1 transition and thus we need to evaluate the multiparticle correlation function .",
    "unfortunately this correlation function is not known .",
    "nevertheless , we can intuitively assume that the relevant correlation will be two - body correlations and that they will be distributed uniformly among all nucleons .",
    "thus , we expect that the @xmath0 quenching will be of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the parameters of our model .",
    "note that other global effects can be taken into account by multiplying @xmath44 by an overall factor as follows : @xmath45 the experimental quenching factor for m1 @xcite and our predictions are depicted in fig .",
    "the agreement is reasonable .",
    "the fitting parameters of eq .",
    "[ 1 ] are @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "this clearly gives a reasonable value for the nuclear susceptibility @xcite @xmath49 the key to matching the experimental susceptibility is to use the correct @xmath50 together with the reduced @xmath51 due to pion exchange @xcite .    .",
    "we have shown in this paper that quantum statistics play a major role in nucleonic spin correlations inside the nucleus . we have found that observables involving the nucleon spins , _",
    "e.g. _ m1 transition amplitudes and/or the paramagnetic susceptibility , are highly sensitive to spin correlations .",
    "a decisive test of our predictions can be made _",
    "e.g. _ with two - proton radioactivity .",
    "we face two major problems in our model , namely :    * a complete knowledge of the total density matrix and , * a measure of multiparticle correlations .",
