    "the phase - space formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite has received a renewed attention in the last decades because it allows to employ notions and tools of classical physics in the quantum realm . the central object in this formulation is the wigner function @xmath0 , which is a phase - space representation of the density matrix @xmath1 . in a closed system , the equation governing its time evolution is equivalent to the schrdinger equation , while in the classical limit it reduces to the liouville equation for the phase - space distribution .    in an open system , i.e. , in contact with the surrounding medium , the system experiences generically dissipation , fluctuations , and decoherence @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of quantum open systems is of interest in many areas of physics and chemistry .",
    "typically one is interested in a system consisting of a few relevant degrees of freedom coupled to its environment , or bath , which has a very large number of degrees of freedom .    under certain conditions ,",
    "the dynamics of an open system can be formulated in terms of a quantum master equation for the ( reduced ) density matrix @xcite . in the wigner representation",
    "the master equation goes in the classical limit over the klein ",
    "kramers equation ( fokker  planck equation in phase space @xcite ) .",
    "recall that phase - space dynamics also includes problems reducible to `` mechanical '' analogues : josephson junctions , certain electrical circuits , chemical reactions , etc . the most powerful technique to solve the klein ",
    "kramers equation is the continued - fraction method .",
    "the distribution is expanded in a basis and the equations for the expansion coefficients derived ( moment equations ) .",
    "these equations , the so - called brinkman hierarchy , have a tridiagonal structure that can be exploited to find the solution with continued fractions @xcite .",
    "the method has also been successfully extended to rotational brownian motion problems of classical spins and dipoles ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .    to deal with quantum dissipative systems , however , is a more complex task .",
    "quantum master equations , except in some simple cases , are difficult to solve .",
    "exact expressions for the time evolution of the density matrix obtained by path - integral methods are available @xcite .",
    "however , they are in general difficult to evaluate , even numerically , because the propagating function is highly oscillatory . finally , quantum monte carlo simulations can in principle be used , but they are computationally complex and suffer from the ( dynamical ) sign problem .",
    "this situation constitutes a strong motivation for the development of alternative methods for quantum dissipative systems , even if they are valid only for specific classes of problems . restricting our attention to the quantum master equation approach , shibata and co - workers @xcite developed continued - fraction methods for a quantum spin in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "vogel and risken @xcite employed similar techniques in quantum nonlinear optics .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this method has not been tried for the quantum master equations in genuine phase - space problems .    in this article",
    "we derive the hierarchy of moment equations corresponding to a generic master equation for the wigner function of the caldeira  leggett type @xcite .",
    "then we show that , in various cases of interest , the continued - fraction method for the classical problem can be adapted to solve this quantum hierarchy , without a sizable increase in sophistication or computational complexity .",
    "this results in a suitable nonperturbative technique to study nonlinear quantum systems subjected to dissipation and thermal fluctuations .",
    "finally , we illustrate the method with the problem of quantum brownian motion in periodic potentials .",
    "we shall consider the following generic master equation for the wigner function of a particle of mass @xmath2 in a potential @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath4 \\wf % \\;.\\ ] ] the first two terms ( poisson bracket ) generate the classical reversible evolution ( liouville equation ) .",
    "the next accounts for irreversible effects due to the coupling to the environment ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the dissipation and diffusion coefficients ) . the mixed diffusion term @xmath7 is heuristically related with the colour of the quantum noise . finally , the infinite series of derivatives @xmath8 gives the quantum contribution to the unitary evolution of the closed system .",
    "conditions under which this series can be truncated are sometimes discussed , implicitly assuming that solving an infinite - order partial differential equation would be a hopeless task .",
    "we shall however keep these terms , which can be specially important in nonlinear systems @xcite . to conclude , in the phase - space formulation , the quantum - mechanical average of any operator @xmath9 is simply obtained from the corresponding classical variable @xmath10 as @xmath11 i.e. , multiplying @xmath10 by the `` distribution '' @xmath0 and integrating over the phase space .",
    "conditions of validity for the description in terms of quantum master equations are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we only mention that equations of the type of eq .",
    "( [ wkk : dxp ] ) are usually derived under assumptions like semiclassical ( high - temperature ) bath , weak system - bath coupling , etc .",

    "in addition , the phase - space representation of the celebrated lindblad master equation @xcite is obtained by simply adding to eq .",
    "( [ wkk : dxp ] ) terms of the form @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "all these types of terms can be readily incorporated in the treatment below .",
    "we shall use scaled variables based on a reference length @xmath16 and a frequency @xmath17 ( e.g. , energy scaled by @xmath18 , action by @xmath19 , etc . ) .",

    "we find two peaks at values associated roughly to the lowest bands ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) , supporting their interpretation . in analogy with the classical case , we would speak of multistability between the `` locked '' ( @xmath114 ) and _ two _ quantum `` running '' solutions . in the classical case",

    "the reason is the dependence of the oscillation period on the amplitude of oscillation in anharmonic potentials , which yields a non - dissipative contribution to @xmath116 @xcite .    in the quantum regime ( approached by decreasing the kondo parameter @xmath119 )",
    "the @xmath116 curves develop a multipeaked structure , which could be loosely interpreted as the nonlinear oscillations becoming quantised .",
    "we have calculated analytically the effect of the anharmonic terms of a cosine potential ( those beyond @xmath120 ) on the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator part .",
    "doing this with first - order perturbation theory , we find the dependence on the energy - level index @xmath121 acquired by the distance between levels @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding frequencies @xmath123 agree quite well with the location of the main peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : suscep - w ] , right panel ) , substantiating the above interpretation . finally , when the temperature is lowered the thermal population of the higher levels is reduced .",
    "then , the transitions between these levels ( `` large amplitude oscillations '' ) become less probable and the corresponding peaks reduced .",
    "we have adapted the continued - fraction method of classical brownian motion to tackle quantum master equations in phase space . as the classical counterpart",
    ", the method is limited to a few degrees of freedom .",
    "besides , it is more problem dependent , as it uses the @xmath13-recurrence and requires a good position basis .",
    "nevertheless , it inherits most advantages from the classical method : efficiency , accuracy , and the obtaining of the `` distribution '' @xmath0 , from which _ any _ observable can be computed .",
    "besides , it is essentially nonperturbative and specially apt for stationary solutions ( static and dynamic ) .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum is not required , which is desirable when dealing with non - bounded hamiltonians , continuous spectra , etc .",
    "the connection with the classical results is always possible and attained in a natural way .",
    "indeed , the knowledge of the classical phase - space structure ( separatrices , attractors , etc . ) plus the visualization of the wigner function , can provide valuable insight into complex problems involving nonlinear quantum systems subjected to dissipation and fluctuations ."
