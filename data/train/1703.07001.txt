    "in signal processing we often encounter situations where the onset of the signal or of part of it is delayed . apart from cases when the starting point itself is a relevant parameter to be measured ( for example in active radar and sonar detection systems ) , this delay often results in degradation of the other measured signal parameters , especially the amplitudes of the various frequency components .",
    "it is therefore convenient to locate the signal starting point so as to be able to optimize the analysis of the data sequence being studied .    with the exception of wavelets ( or multiscale ) techniques , which are known to be efficient at locating edges @xcite and some parametric models which take into account possible delays @xcite , most methods in the literature compare some measured quantity for a series of contiguous traveling windows , be it power @xcite , correlation to a library of known waveforms @xcite , or some other quantities @xcite .",
    "the method we propose instead considers a single window ; moreover when different signal components start at different times it locates first the onset time for the signal frequency component with the longest delay , i.e. the first data point where all the signal components are present .",
    "this is often the sought for information . by iteration",
    "it can then locate the starting points for all other components , should they be needed too .",
    "our method is based on the analytic properties of the generating function of the data series , which as we shall see depend on the signal delay .",
    "more in detail : given an infinite data series @xmath0 , we can build its generating function , or ",
    "g - transform \" : @xmath1 in practice , we always have data series that are truncated at order @xmath2 , therefore consisting of @xmath3 data points . assuming the total signal to be the discrete sum of a finite number of ( damped ) harmonic oscillations , we want to estimate the g - transform of the infinite time series by a suitable pad approximant : a rational function whose taylor expansion around @xmath4 reproduces the g - transform up to order @xmath2 .",
    "the problem is that any ratio @xmath5 $ ] of the order @xmath6 of the numerator to the order @xmath7 of the denominator such that @xmath8 is a candidate pad approximant ; which is the best one ?    we know that if all the signals are already present at @xmath9 , then even in the presence of noise the best choice is a rational function of type @xmath10 $ ] @xcite , requiring @xmath11 data points . from its parameters",
    "all the ( complex ) amplitudes and frequencies can be deducted , provided that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total number of frequencies in the signal , including complex conjugate pairs .",
    "things change if some of the frequency components of the signal start at some @xmath14",
    "s larger than zero :    let s assume we have @xmath13 signals starting at @xmath15 with @xmath16 ; as we shall see , the g - transform is then a rational function of the type @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "our first aim is therefore to find the ( discrete ) time @xmath18 at which the last frequency component starts . to do this ,",
    "we introduce the u - transform which is the logarithmic derivative of the g - transform : @xmath19 the poles of the u - transform are the poles and zeros of the g - transform and their residues are @xmath20 for the g - transform poles and @xmath21 for the zeros ; the sum of the residues of the u - transform therefore is @xmath22 .    if our aim is to find the best pad approximant for the given sample , we are then done , as @xmath18 is the sought for information .",
    "if instead we want to find all the starting points @xmath14 , @xmath23 , we just have to repeat the procedure with a shorter sample of length @xmath24 to find @xmath25 , and so on , until the sample length is reduced to zero .",
    "let us start considering a single discretized signal starting at an unknown time @xmath14 : @xmath26 the signal can be transient ( i.e. damped : @xmath27 ) , of constant amplitude ( @xmath28 ) , or even have zero frequency ( corresponding to a step function ) .",
    "the g - transform of this signal reads : @xmath29 which is a @xmath30 $ ] rational function @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a polynomial in @xmath33 of order @xmath34 and the index indicates that it refers to the signal @xmath35 .",
    "summing @xmath13 such signals with different starting times , we get    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and we have indicated with @xmath38 the polynomial at the numerator and with @xmath39 the one at the denominator .",
    "adding noise does not change the the substance of the above picture , as it means to add an equal number @xmath40 of poles and zeros ( froissart doublets @xcite ) so that the complete g - transform reads : @xmath41 where we have respectively called @xmath42 and @xmath43 the zeros and poles of @xmath44 , which is a @xmath45 $ ] rational function , thus requiring @xmath46 data points to be reconstructed by pad approximant .",
    "now that we know the form of the g - transform , we can calculate the form of the corresponding u - transform , eq . [ 2 ] : @xmath47 from this last formula , it is evident that @xmath48 is a rational function of type @xmath10 $ ] with @xmath49 ; the @xmath50 residues of its poles can only assume the values @xmath51 and most important @xmath22 is equal to the number of poles with residue @xmath21 minus the number of poles of residues @xmath20 i.e. the sum of the residues itself , as we stated in the introduction .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that the above argument works not only for signals starting at @xmath15 , but also for signals peaking at those points .",
    "this is because the growing part of each signal ends at the starting point of the decaying part , and therefore its z - transform is a polynomial .",
    "more in detail : let us consider a signal of the form @xmath52 it s g - transform will be @xmath53 the first addendum is a polynomial in @xmath33 of order @xmath54 , while the second addendum is again given by eq .",
    "[ 5 ] ; we can therefore write @xmath55 which again is a @xmath30 $ ] rational function .",
    "the first step of our method is to compute the taylor series of @xmath48 from the one ( eq . [ 1 ] ) defining @xmath56 , so as to be able to then build its pad approximant , from which to get the residues of its poles , and finally @xmath18 .    from ref .",
    "@xcite ( section @xmath57 ) , the coefficients @xmath58 of the taylor expansion of the ratio of two expansions @xmath59 are given by the recurrence formula @xmath60 in our case the coefficients of the series at the denominator are @xmath61 from eq .",
    "[ 1 ] ; those of the series at the numerator are @xmath62 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to define @xmath63 and @xmath64 so as to have a recurrence formula for the coefficients themselves : @xmath65    from eq .",
    "[ 3 ] , we have seen that the pad for @xmath48 has to be be of type @xmath10 $ ] , with @xmath66 poles .",
    "we therefore need a @xmath67 term expansion for @xmath48 .",
    "we ll have to get to @xmath68 , or @xmath69 in the recurrence formula eq .",
    "[ 4 ] , for which we need @xmath70 data points from the original series , as opposed to the @xmath71 points only , needed to reconstruct @xmath56 .",
    "the maximum possible value for @xmath18 corresponds to the case when the data series contains only the signal starting at @xmath18 , meaning @xmath72 and @xmath73 ; therefore , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which gives us the bound @xmath76 for the possible delays detectable from a truncated sequence of @xmath77 data points .",
    "we present here some numerical examples as a test of the method described above .",
    "our first example considers a signal of the form @xmath78 to which random noise uniform in @xmath79 $ ] is added . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the difference between the number of residues around @xmath21 ( within a radius @xmath80 ) and the number of residues around @xmath20 ( again within a radius @xmath80 ) , as a function of the delay @xmath81 , for various levels of noise between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the plot is in agreement with our statement in section [ theo ] that the delay equals said difference .",
    "as expected , the linear dependence of the difference on the delay fails at about @xmath84 .",
    "our next example considers the case of three signals , one of which one is delayed : @xmath85 in this case , the noise we add is a complex gaussian random noise with variance @xmath86 in both real and imaginary part . in figure",
    "[ fig2].a we show the signal for @xmath87 : as the amplitudes of the three signals are comparable , the beginning of the delayed signal is barely visible .",
    "figure [ fig2].b shows the poles of the pad approximant to @xmath48 ( crosses ) and the poles and zeros of of the @xmath88 $ ] pad approximant to @xmath56 ( circles and squares , respectively ) : clearly something is wrong with the assumption that @xmath56 is a rational function of the @xmath88 $ ] type : instead of having the @xmath56 poles distributed around the unit circle , @xmath89 poles form a circle inside the unit circle ( two more are close but not on the circle itself ) .",
    "finally figure [ fig2].c shows the cumulative number of residues as a function of the distance from @xmath21 ( black line ) and from @xmath20 ( red line ) , together with their difference ( blue line ) : the latter shows a maximum of @xmath90 at a distance of about @xmath91 .    to check our claim that the difference between the number of poles with residue @xmath21 and those with residues @xmath20 equals the longest delay , we now pass to the case of two delayed signals : @xmath92 to which complex gaussian random noise with variance @xmath86 in both real and imaginary part is again added . in figure",
    "[ fig3].a we show the signal for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ fig3].b shows the poles of the pad approximant to @xmath48 ( crosses ) and the poles and zeros of of the @xmath88 $ ] pad approximant to @xmath56 ( circles and squares , respectively ) : again the assumption that @xmath56 is a rational function of the @xmath88 $ ] type produces a circle of poles inside the unit circle . figure [ fig3].c shows the cumulative number of residues as a function of the distance from @xmath21 ( black line ) and from @xmath20 ( red line ) , together with their difference ( blue line ) .",
    "this time the difference only reaches @xmath95 at a distance of about @xmath91 and only gets to @xmath90 for a distance close to @xmath96 .",
    "we finally consider the case when the delayed signal is present all the time , but peaks at @xmath97 : @xmath98 again complex gaussian random noise with variance @xmath86 in both real and imaginary part is added and we consider @xmath87 .",
    "the results are very similar to those of figure [ fig2 ] ; as expected the maximum difference is @xmath99 .",
    "we have shown that the information about the starting points in time of a number of delayed signals can be directly retrieved from the residues of the poles of the u - transform of the signal : they can only be @xmath51 and their sum plus one equals the longest delay among those of the signal s frequency components .",
    "we have then described how an iterative algorithm using this property can be implemented in practice to locate the starting points in time of all the frequency components of a signal .",
    "numerical examples confirm the feasibility and stability of the proposed scheme .",
