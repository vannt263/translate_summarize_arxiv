    "we identify the transition state and study the dependence of the associated activation energy on the system parameters .    according to the classical transition state theory @xcite ,",
    "transition states are specials points in the @xmath53-dimensional phase space .",
    "more precisely , a transition state @xmath54 is a hyperbolic fixed point obtained from the stationary system of the deterministic dynamical system given by @xmath48   for @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding jacobian possesses at least one real positive eigenvalues which corresponds to the movement along the reaction coordinate .",
    "all other eigenvalues are negative .",
    "we apply a multi - dimensional root finding algorithm using the newton - raphson method to calculate the transition state from the corresponding stationary system .    as a result of the considered overdamped dynamics of the system and the reflection of the periodicity of the on - site potential @xmath16 by the @xmath53-dimensional phase space instead of one global basin of attraction , referred to as the running state , multiple locally stable attractors exist @xcite .",
    "therefore the phase space possesses many different transition states which can be either linked with one required unique activation energy or different ones . since the escape rate over an energy barrier @xmath52 is assumed to be described by the vant hoff - arrhenius law @xcite , @xmath56 , we restrict our analytical consideration of possible escape processes to scenarios with low amount of activation energy .",
    "the energy of one configuration is determined by the energy functional @xmath57 @xmath58 further , the activation energy @xmath59 is defined as the difference between the energy of the transition state configuration @xmath54 and the energy of the chain at the initial metastable state @xmath60 @xmath61    below , we discuss the numerically calculated results for the transition state configuration ( tsc ) of the initial escape scenario in which only the pulled particle escapes from its initial minima to the next well of the on - site potential in positive x - direction .",

    ", one can see that for @xmath64 , see @xmath48  , the escape process is governed by an individual escape of the pulled unit independent of the coupling strength . at the tsc",
    "the @xmath65th oscillator is always placed at the top of the energy barrier located at @xmath66 while all other units rest at the minimum of the on - site potential @xmath16 without changes of the respective bond length @xmath63 .    for @xmath67 and all values of the coupling strength @xmath50 ,",
    "the pulled particle is placed beyond the energy barrier of the on - site potential and its neighbors are elongated in x - direction . according to the deterministic part of the equations of motion @xmath48  ,",
    "the condition @xmath68 is fulfilled either if the distance between two neighboring particles equals the bond length @xmath63 or the displacement @xmath69 is equal to zero .",

    "note that as a consequence of the imposed open boundary conditions all units of the chain are elongated from their starting equilibrium positions at the transition state configuration .    comparing the obtained tsc for weak coupling in @xmath17  [ fig : profa ] and the ones for stronger coupling in @xmath17  [ fig : profb ]",
    ", one recognizes that with increasing coupling the number of elongated units involved in the transition state grows . in the case of very weak coupling ,",
    "the units of the chain tend to diffuse via individual steps . despite",
    "that there result large elongations , @xmath73 , during the process the units remain bound to each other . with further increasing value of coupling @xmath50",
    "the oscillators move like a rigid unit with @xmath74 and thus display organized collective behavior reflected in synchronized escape .",
    "such a dependence of the diffusion type on the coupling strength is already experimentally known @xcite and theoretical investigated @xcite for dimers diffusing on a surface .",
    "nevertheless , due to the considered overdamped dynamics of the chain multiple local domains of attraction exist for @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the transport of the chain in point force direction is determined by _",
    "stepwise escapes _ of single units or segments of the chain .",
    "these stepwise crossings are connected with configurational changes of the chain .",
    "in the following , we study separately the scaling behavior of the activation energy for different escape steps in order to assess the time scales of the latter .",
    "the characteristic time one particle needs to escape from @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is one arbitrary reference point ) is determined by the first moment of the first escape time distribution @xmath78 @xcite .",

    "we start with the _ first escape scenario_. in the latter only the pulled particle escapes from its initial minima to the next well of the on - site potential in positive x - direction while all other units remain close to their starting position . in order to determine the scaling behavior of the activation energy for the first escape scenario in the limit of weak coupling , @xmath81",
    ", we consider a truncated one - dimensional trimer model . according to the tsc presented in @xmath17  [ fig :",
    "profa ] , the escape process involves only three units for @xmath67 .",
    "all other units rest at the minimum of the on - site potential @xmath82 under maintenance of the bond length @xmath63 and hence do not contribute energy to the activation energy of the escape process .",
    "the condition of stationarity in y - direction @xmath68 is fulfilled by setting @xmath83 . since we observed hairpin - like crossing configurations in the simulations for non - vanishing but sufficiently point force magnitude @xmath7",
    ", we consider only reflection symmetry tsc , i.e. @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for @xmath86",
    ", we can assume that the stationary tsc is adopted when the pulled unit of the chain is situated close to @xmath87 and the value of the coordinate @xmath88 is almost zero .",
    "hence we put    @xmath89    into the deterministic part of @xmath48   and solve the linearized system of equation @xmath90 . despite",
    "that we consider the weak coupling limit , @xmath91 , further simplifications of the system of equations by expanding the interaction potential @xmath92 up to the @xmath1nd order is not possible since the bonds are stretched , @xmath93 , at the tsc @xmath17  [ fig : prof ] .",
    "substituting @xmath94 we get    @xmath95    [ eq : tsc1 ]    for the first escape scenario , the energy of the chain at the initial metastable state is almost close to @xmath96 regardless of the value of the bond length . using the expressions given in @xmath48",
    ", we obtain the following scaling behavior of the activation energy for the first escape scenario @xmath48   @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath75 .",
    "the numerical results for the activation energy for the first escape scenario and the analytic one are depicted in @xmath17  [ fig : eact ] and labeled by @xmath62 .",
    "both results match very well .    in the limit @xmath99 , the transition state configuration is always given by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , with @xmath102 regardless of the coupling strength .",
    "then the corresponding activation energy attains the saturation value @xmath103 one recognizes that the curve , label @xmath62 , of the activation energy in @xmath17  [ fig : eact ] finally converges to the limit value @xmath104 represented by the horizontal dashed line .      in the second escape scenario",
    "the @xmath105th particles escape from the first well to the next one while all other units remain close to their starting position .",
    "this case is sketched in @xmath17  [ fig : escsk ] and labeled by @xmath106 .",
    "the configuration of the chain at the initial metastable state can be described by an effective two particle problem . by using the following ansatz for the position of the particles    @xmath107    and",
    "solving again the linearized stationary system of equation , we get    @xmath108    [ eq : min2 ]    the transition state configuration in the @xmath1nd escape scenario is determined by an effective three particle problem . for @xmath109 , we assume that the stationary configuration is adopted when the pulled unit is located close to @xmath110 , its neighbors are located at top of the energy barrier , situated at @xmath87 , and the @xmath111th particles rest at the minimum of the starting well . hence we put    @xmath112    into the deterministic part of @xmath48   and solve again the linearized system of equation under the condition @xmath55 . finally we obtain for the correction terms @xmath113 the solutions    @xmath114    [ eq : tsc2 ]    in @xmath17  [ fig : eact ] , label @xmath106 , we depict the graphs showing the dependence of the activation energy on the bond length @xmath63 for the @xmath1nd escape process .",
    "the theoretical result matches very well with the numerics for @xmath115 .",
    "in particular it has to be emphasized that the position of the minimum of the activation energy as a function of the bond length is very well reproduced by the analytic expression given in @xmath48   and .",
    "the analytical result deviates from the numerics with further increasing value of the bond length since the theory does not reproduce that the tsc is always given by @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 with @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "in addition the activation energy eventually attains the saturation value @xmath121 in limit of large bond lengths because then the tsc is determined by the given above fixed configuration .      at the end of the @xmath1nd escape process the pulled particle and its two neighbors are located in the same well of the on - site potential while all other constituents of the chain remain in the well behind @xmath17  [ fig : escsk ] .",
    "therefore the situation for the pulled unit is similar to the initial condition in the first escape process and the circumstances for its two neighbors resemble the one at the beginning of the second escape scenario .",
    "thereupon , either the @xmath111th units escape like in the previously mentioned @xmath1nd case or the pulled particle escapes further forward .",
    "the last case is sketched in @xmath17  [ fig : escsk ] and is labeled by @xmath122 .",
    "the dependence of activation energy on the bond length is depicted in @xmath17  [ fig : eact ] .",
    "the latter is similar to the results for the @xmath0st scenario but is evidently shifted to higher energies due to the fact that the bonds @xmath123 are stretched during the escape process which is in contrast to the @xmath0st case .",
    "furthermore it is shown that the activation energy reaches the limit value @xmath104 not until @xmath124 .    to sum up",
    ", we have shown that in the limit of weak coupling , @xmath125 , the escape behavior of the chain is governed by consecutive individual escapes of single oscillators . in the limit of small bond length @xmath126 ,",
    "the units of the chain escape forward in @xmath127-direction by using the escape scenario @xmath62 and @xmath106 . for larger values of the bond length ,",
    "the @xmath1nd and @xmath128rd escape scenario are utilized by the units in an alternating manner .",
    "notably the vital second escape scenario , @xmath4  [ subsec:2ndesc ] , requests a higher amount of activation energy compared to the other two scenarios and hence governs the time scale of chain transport which is reflected in the mobility .",
    "having studied the escape dynamics of the system which is the precondition for transport , in the following we focus our interest on the transport properties of a chain of interacting nonlinear overdamped brownian particles confined onto a periodic substrate . in the case of a chain driven by a dc point force oriented along a symmetry axis of a @xmath1d substrate , the stationary transport proceeds in force direction , whereas transverse diffusion is not affected by the bias .",
    "when considering interacting brownian particles , it is appropriate to study the motion of their center of mass ( c.o.m . ) .",
    "the position of the c.o.m . in force",
    "direction at time @xmath129 is denoted by @xmath130 . referring to @xmath48  , the le reads as @xmath131 with the @xmath132-correlated gaussian white noise @xmath133 . the nonlinear behavior of @xmath130 results from the term @xmath134 in @xmath48  .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as an effective sliding friction force @xmath135 which results from the interaction of the single units with the substrate @xmath16 .",
    "the motion of the chain is quantitatively assessed by the net velocity of the c.o.m .",

    "starting from a thermal equilibrated configuration in which all constituents of the chain are located near the bottom of one well of @xmath16 , the external point force has been applied at the @xmath8-th unit at @xmath144 .",
    "the stochastic trajectories of the constituents have been integrated numerically from @xmath145 with the time step @xmath146 up to @xmath147 .",

    "first we study the influence of the internal degrees of freedom , viz . the bond length @xmath63 , on the mobility @xmath139 . in @xmath4  [ subsec:2ndesc ]",
    "we showed that in the limit of weak coupling the escape rate @xmath151 and the mean first escape time @xmath80 of the dominating second escape process , respectively , exhibits a resonance behavior as a function of the bond length . due to the fact that escape of the units of the chain is necessary for transport of the chain",
    ", we expect to observe a characteristic dependence of the velocity of the system on the bond length .",
    "several authors @xcite have shown that the transport of an underdamped @xmath0d dimer system in a periodic potential strongly depends on its bond length @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , it was found that the mobility @xmath152 is a reflection symmetric function which attains its maximum value at @xmath153 and varies periodically with @xmath154 regardless of the coupling strength and force magnitude @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the mobility of the @xmath1d discrete nonlinear coupled oscillator chain shows a resonance behavior as a function of the bond length @xmath63 with one single maximum within a period of the substrate potential .",
    "this means there exist a set of optimal parameter values maximizing the mobility and optimizing the transport properties of the system , respectively .",
    "further the mobility as a function of system parameter exhibits properties which coincide with the results presented in @xcite but also shows several new phenomena .",
    "let us first have a look on the influence of the coupling strength @xmath50 on the mobility as a function of the bond length . in @xmath17  [",
    "fig : mobal ] the numerical results for the mobility versus the bond length @xmath63 for various values of @xmath24 are depicted .",
    "we remind that the inverse interaction range @xmath24 and the coupling strength @xmath50 are related according to @xmath48  .",
    "it turns out that there exist a finite interval of the bond lengths , @xmath155 , in which translocation occurs .",
    "further it is recognizable that with increasing coupling strength @xmath50 the lower limit @xmath156 approaches from below the position of the unstable state of the on - site potential @xmath66 , see @xmath48  .",
    "this is in compliance with the results presented in @xmath4  [ subsec:1stesc ] since for @xmath99 the activation energy of the first escape scenario is determined by the saturation value @xmath157 @xmath48   which is independent of the coupling strength @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast in the range @xmath67 , the number of units participating in the first escape event , and therewith connected the activation energy , grows with increasing coupling strength .",
    "hence the mean first escape time @xmath158 increases with the value of @xmath50 and thus the mobility goes to zero in the limit @xmath159 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath160 turns out to be independent of the coupling strength .",
    "hence the larger the value of @xmath50 the narrower is the interval of the bond lengths where the chain is mobile for a given @xmath7 and @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the mobility grows monotonically with increasing value of @xmath63 from @xmath156 till the bond length is equal to @xmath161 , where the mobility possesses its maximal value @xmath162 . with upon growing bond length , @xmath163",
    ", the mobility decays till @xmath164 .",
    "it turns out that the value of @xmath161 depends on the coupling strength @xmath50 . in the case of weak coupling , @xmath165 , the position @xmath161 is left from @xmath87 which is in contrast to the results obtained for the 1d underdamped dimer @xcite . with increasing coupling strength @xmath50 the position @xmath161 approaches from below @xmath87 .",
    "further it is demonstrated that the peak height of the mobility @xmath162 increases with the coupling strength till @xmath50 reaches the value @xmath166 . for @xmath167 ,",
    "the maximum value of the mobility remains almost constant upon changing @xmath50 for a given value of @xmath7 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that the shape of the mobility graph is asymmetric with respect to @xmath161 which is in contrast to the results obtained for the 1d underdamped dimer @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mobility of one single overdamped brownian particle can be calculated by means of the stratonovich formula @xcite . comparing the mobility of a monomer , represented by the horizontal solid line in @xmath17  [ fig : mobal ] , with the presented maximum values of @xmath152 ,",
    "one concludes that the response of the extended @xmath1d chain to the external driving is less than the one of the monomer .",
    "but in the limit of strong coupling both responses nearly coincide .",
    "this indicates that the chain consisting of nonlinear coupled oscillator synchronizes and thus behaves like one heavy brownian particle with mass @xmath5 .",
    "due to the mutual impact of stochastic forces , the point force and the interaction with the substrate the bonds of the chain experience dynamical alterations .",
    "therefore the adopted distance between two adjacent units mostly differs from the bond length @xmath63 during the motion of the chain . to gain more insight",

    "in contrast to the results shown in @xmath17  [ fig : mobal ] , the mobility always reaches the maximal value at @xmath170 regardless of the value of @xmath50 . assuming that the position of a particle @xmath171 can be described by means of the averaged distance between two units , one finds that for @xmath172 the effective sliding friction force @xmath135 , see @xmath48  , possesses its minimum value and thus the mobility reaches its maximum value .",
    "subsequently we study the influence of the point force magnitude @xmath7 on the mobility @xmath139 for given coupling strength and temperature .",
    "the results are presented in @xmath17  [ fig : mobfsub ] .",
    "it is shown that the value of the lower limit value @xmath156 is strongly influenced by the point force magnitude @xmath7 , more precisely the larger the value of @xmath7 the less is the value of @xmath156 . referring to the scaling behavior of @xmath173 given in @xmath48  , the activation energy of the first escape process decreases linearly with the value of @xmath7 for a given bond length @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the lower limit value @xmath156 goes to zero for @xmath174 .",
    "in contrast , it turns out that the upper limit value @xmath160 is not influenced by the point force magnitude @xmath7 .",

    "the value of the bond length is fixed at @xmath194 a value for which the chain is considerably mobile regardless of the coupling strength @xmath50 . in general ,",
    "since one can not find a preferential direction of the random brownian motion in a spatially periodic potential at thermal equilibrium @xcite the velocity @xmath141 attains the smallest value for @xmath195 independent of the value of @xmath27 .",

    "with further increasing value of @xmath7 the mobility grows monotonically and finally goes to @xmath140 in the limit @xmath197 .    from @xmath17",
    "[ fig : mobft ] we deduce that the value of the depinning force @xmath191 goes to zero with increasing temperature @xmath27 .",
    "in particular for @xmath198 , the mobility attains a non - zero value regardless of @xmath7 . for a sufficiently weak point force magnitude , @xmath75",
    ", the mobility increases for stronger thermal fluctuations , that is higher temperatures . in this parameter region the motion of the chain is mainly instigated by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "additionally , it turns out that in the limit of overcritical external driving , @xmath199 , the slope of the mobility as a function of the point force decreases for higher temperatures , i.e. we observe a _ noise - induced suppression of the mobility_.    since the escape rate and therewith connected the mobility increases with growing value of the temperature according to the arrhenius - vant hoff law , the observed result seems to be counter - intuitive . by applying the point force at the @xmath8-th unit , its effective energy landscape changes .",
    "the motion of the particles , which are close to the pulled one , proceeds preferably in point force direction due to the lower energy barrier .",
    "the situation for units located nearby the endings of the chain is different . due to the symmetry of the on - site potential the probabilities , respectively , the rates to escape forward or backward are equal .",
    "hence it is possible that single units or a segment of the chain escape in direction opposite to the one determined by the point force . due to the fact that the mean time which the center of mass needs to move forward a certain distance grows with increasing value of @xmath27 , the effective c.o.m .",
    "velocity in force direction becomes lower .",
    "finally we study the dependence of the mobility on temperature for certain fixed point force magnitudes @xmath7 .",

    ", @xmath139 grows slightly linear regardless of the point force magnitude .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ negative resistance _ @xcite . comparing the curves for @xmath204 and @xmath205 , it turns out that the value of the critical temperature depends on the point force magnitude ,",

    "in summary , we have considered the thermal activated motion of an extended two - dimensional discrete oscillator chain absorbed on a periodically structured substrate under the influence of a localized point force .",
    "attention has been paid to the escape dynamics of the chain from the metastable states of the substrate potential which is accomplished by the adaption of kink - like excitations  also referred to as the transition state .",
    "the shape of the latter and the corresponding activation energies have been calculated . due to the fact that the bending rigidity is equal to zero ,",
    "the obtained transition structures resemble the shape of very thin needles . as a novel feature",
    "we have found that the transport of the chain in point force direction is determined by stepwise escapes of a single unit or segments of the chain due to the existence of multiple locally stable attractors . in the limit of strong coupling , @xmath207 , the units exhibit an organized collective behavior and the chain escapes like a rigid unit from one domain of attraction to the subsequent one .",
    "in contrast for weak coupling , @xmath81 , it has been found that the escape behavior of the chain is governed by consecutive individual escape steps of single oscillators .",
    "therefore , we have identified the first three possible escape scenarios with the lowest amount of activation energy .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that the vital second escape scenario , which requests a higher amount of activation energy compared to the other two scenarios and thus governs the time scale it takes for the chain to be transported by one period of the substrate potential , possesses a minimum at a certain value of the bond length @xmath63 . from this",
    "follows that for unfavorable ratios of the bond length the escape will be highly improbable while other ratios will bear good conditions for the chain to escape .",
    "the complicated dependence of the activation energy , respectively , of the escape rate on the bond length is reflected in a non - monotonous behavior of the center of mass mobility .",
    "the latter exhibits features which previously have been found in models considering one harmonically coupled one - dimensional dimer @xcite , viz .",
    "the mobility reflects the periodicity of the substrate potential and the latter reaches its maximum value if and only if the mean distance between the two coupled units equals an odd integer number times the value of the half periodicity of the periodic potential . in comparison",
    "we have presented several new transport phenomena . for sufficiently weak external driving , @xmath75",
    ", the mobility shows a resonance behavior as a function of the bond length @xmath63 with one single maximum within each period of the substrate potential whose position @xmath183 depends on all system parameters .",
    "in general it turned out that the mobility attains its maximum value if and only if the mean distance @xmath168 between the coupled units equals @xmath208 .",
    "the connection between @xmath183 and @xmath209 is determined by the interplay of different acting forces .",
    "further we have shown that the maximal value of the mobility @xmath162 at @xmath183 decays upon increasing bond length .",
    "lastly , the role of the thermal fluctuations and the external driving played for the activated motion of the chain has been considered . while it has been found that for sufficiently weak point force magnitude the mobility grows monotonically with increasing temperature , for a given overcritical external driving force the phenomenon of negative resistance has been found , i.e. the mobility possesses a minimum at a finite value of the strength of the thermal fluctuations ."
