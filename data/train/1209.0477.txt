    "ideally , in order to constrain models of smbh fueling , growth , and impact on the host galaxy one would like to follow across time the stochastic process that is the evolution of smbhs and their hosts .",

    "because of this , the demographics of smbhs , agn , and their host galaxies is one of the primary empirical tools that we have for placing constraints on astrophysical models of smbh growth and fueling .",

    "* ) , a phenomenon termed ` cosmic downsizing ' . that the more luminous agn population turns - off at earlier cosmic epochs implies that the more massive smbhs grow first .",
    "the luminosity function is the convolution of the black hole mass function with the eddington ratio distribution , weighted by the duty cycle of agn activity ; the duty cycle is the fraction of smbhs that are ` active ' at any time .",
    "thus , while easy to measure , the luminosity function provides somewhat limited physical insight .",
    "fortunately , we have other empirical tools based on agn demograhics which provide various complementary observational constraints on smbh growth and fueling .",
    "these include spatial clustering of agn , agn host galaxy properties , and black hole mass and eddington ratio distributions as a function of redshift .",
    "spatial clustering provides observational constraints on the masses of agn host dark matter halos , the bias of agn environments , and agn duty cycle .",
    "agn host galaxy properties , on the other hand , provide insight into the fueling and triggering of agn activity , as well as the effects of agn feedback . and finally , studies of smbh mass and eddington ratio distributions provide insight into the growth of supermassive black holes and agn duty cycles .",
    "these various empirical tools provide different but complementary information , and it is the goal of this work to further improve our understanding of smbh mass and eddington ratio distributions for type 1 quasars",
    ".    the black hole mass function ( bhmf ) and black hole eddington ratio function ( bherf ) quantify the comoving number density of smbhs as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the bhmf and bherf provide a complete census of the smbh population with respect to @xmath5 and @xmath8 , providing important information for constraining models of smbh growth . indeed , many models for smbh growth have made predictions for the bhmf and bherf at a variety of redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for a review of the bhmf of smbhs , see @xcite .",
    "there are two common approaches for estimating the bhmf and bherf .",
    "the first approach is to employ a continuity equation describing the evolution of the smbh population , and has its roots in the work of @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind these continuity - equation methods is to assume a bhmf at very high redshift , use the agn luminosity function as a probe of how fast the bhmf is changing , and then evolve the bhmf using the local bhmf as a constraint .",
    "the continuity equation methods also provide an estimate of the typical duty cycle and radiative efficiency of smbhs , which can then be linked to a typical quasar lifetime and black hole spin , respectively .",
    "several authors have derived the local bhmf for all smbhs from individual sources using the scaling relationships between @xmath5 and host spheroidal properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing the needed integral constraint for the continuity equation method .",
    "a number of groups have employed variations on the continuity equation technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have generally concluded that most , if not all , of the local bhmf can be explained as the relic of agn activity , with smbh growth being dominated by periods when the smbh was radiating near the eddington limit . in addition , these studies have generally concluded that smbh growth is anti - hierarchical , in agreement with the cosmic downsizing seen in the agn luminosity function studies .",
    "the other commonly employed approach to estimating the bhmf and bherf is to use scaling relationships to obtain estimates of @xmath5 for individual sources , and then derive the bhmf and bherf from the distribution of these estimates .",
    "indeed , this approach provides the local bhmf needed for the continuity equation approach .",
    "it is also possible to incorporate scaling relationships into the continuity equation methods , as done by @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the scaling relationship approach is that the bhmf and bherf at a given redshift is derived from the distribution of @xmath5 estimates , providing more information at that redshift than is provided by the local bhmf integral constraint used in the continuity equation methods .",
    "unfortunately , the scaling relationship methods have the disadvantage that the host galaxy scaling relationships are currently only used to estimate the @xmath9 bhmf and bherf for all smbhs .",
    "many studies have found evidence for evolution in the smbh - host galaxy scaling relationships ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "2012 for cautionary notes ) , and , while there have been attempts to estimate the bhmf based on an assumed form of the evolution in the scaling relationships @xcite , the quantitative form of the evolution has not been sufficiently precise to motivate widespread use of the scaling relationships to estimate bhmfs beyond the local universe .    for type 1",
    "quasars , an alternative to employing the host galaxy scaling relationships to estimate @xmath5 is to employ so - called virial mass estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these virial mass estimates are derived by using the width of the broad emission lines as a proxy for the velocity dispersion of the clouds emitting the broad emission lines , and the luminosity as a proxy for the broad line region size @xcite .",
    "the virial mass estimates have a statistical scatter about the mass estimates derived from reverberation mapping @xcite of @xmath10 dex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there may be additional systematic errors @xcite .",
    "the virial and reverberation mapping mass estimates are calibrated to the local @xmath5@xmath11 relationship @xcite .",
    "the virial mass estimates have the advantage that they can be used beyond the local universe , providing estimates of the bhmf and bherf for active smbhs directly from estimates of @xmath5 .",
    "however , they have the disadvantage that they only estimate the bhmf for type 1 quasars , which are a subset of the active smbh population , which in turn is a subset of the entire smbh population . however , despite this , the bhmf and bherf for type 1 quasars still provide an important observational constraint on models for smbh growth that is complementary to other empirical tools based on agn demographics .",
    "compared to luminosity , studies of agn demographics with respect to @xmath5 have the advantage that mass is a more stable quantity , in that @xmath5 can only increase and does so during active phases or through smbh mergers . as a result ,",
    "demographics of agn @xmath5 probe the subset of smbhs that are actively growing at any given @xmath12 and @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that , for example , the type 1 quasar bhmf provides an estimate of the smbh duty cycle for type 1 quasar activity as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath12 , provided one has an estimate of the bhmf for all smbhs at that redshift .",
    "moreover , estimates of smbh growth times for type 1 quasars , calculated from the bhmf and bherf , can also provide constraints on models for smbh growth , especially at high redshift .",
    "in particular , the discovery of type 1 quasars with @xmath13 out to @xmath14@xmath15 @xcite places strong constraints on models for the formation and growth of smbh seeds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xmath5 is a fundamental physical parameter of black hole accretion flows , making the bhmf and bherf important for studies of accretion physics , as it describes which regions of the @xmath5@xmath8 plane are probed by current and future surveys .",

    "in addition , the eddington ratio distributions derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k10 ) and @xcite imply that at @xmath16 there is a broad range in @xmath8 for type 1 quasars , and that most type 1 quasars are not radiating near the eddington limit ; similar results were obtained by @xcite at @xmath17 .",
    "this is the second paper in a two - part series to study the demographics of type 1 quasars out to @xmath18 in the two - dimensional quasar mass and luminosity space .",
    "such studies represent a next step in type 1 quasar demographic studies by placing joint constraints on the distributions of their instantaneous activity ( i.e. , luminosity function ) and assembly history ( i.e. , bh mass function ) via the eddington ratio distribution . as such",
    ", the 2d demographic studies provide an advanced view of the cosmic growth of the smbh population compared to using the luminosity function or bhmf alone .",
    "our study is motivated by both the recent availability of @xmath0 uniformly selected type 1 quasars from the sdss dr7 with virial mass estimates from @xcite , as well as the recent advancements in statistical techniques for studying agn demographics .",
    "the incredible size of this data set combined with our new powerful statistical tools provides us with an unprecedented ability to characterize the demographics of type 1 quasars at a variety of redshifts .",
    "the broad redshift range of our sample ( @xmath19 ) allows us to probe the evolution of a subset of the actively growing smbh population during the epochs over which @xmath20 of smbh growth occured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in the first paper of this series , (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we presented our sample as well as the binned estimates of the luminosity function and the bhmf .",
    "we also extended the statistical method of k10 to estimate the bhmf independently in different redshift bins , and to include a luminosity - dependent bias term for the virial mass estimates .",

    "in addition , we also use a student s @xmath25-distribution to model the distribution of measurement errors in the mass estimates , which downweights outliers compared to the previously - used gaussian distribution .",
    "this latter improvement was incorporated to make our results more robust against outliers in the mass - luminosity plane , as such sources may be subject to unidentified systematic error .",
    "we made these improvements to test the robustness of the key conclusions from paper i. * because we have employed a more flexible model for the bherf , the focus of this paper is on the bhmf and bherf of type 1 quasars .",
    "as such , in this paper we discuss the bhmf and bherf in greater depth than we did in paper i , and discuss the distribution of eddington ratios at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , we discuss what the derived bhmf and bherf imply with regard to the growth of supermassive black holes .",
    "* we focus our presentation and discussion on the bhmf and bherf based on the usual assumption that the mass estimates are unbiased .",
    "this is the assumption that is typically made in the literature , but is different from paper i where we allowed the mass estimates to have a luminosity - dependent bias . in this paper",
    "we present the results for the model assuming the estimates are unbiased , but also discuss how allowing a luminosity - dependent bias changes the results . between paper i and this paper we cover both simple models for the behavior of the virial mass estimates with respect to the bhmf and bherf .",
    "* unlike in paper i , we do not present or discuss the optical luminosity function implied by our model , as there is little difference from paper i , nor is the luminosity function the focus of this paper .",

    "lower case letters refer to logarithms of quantities based on mass or luminosity , e.g. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "early estimates of the bhmf were obtained by directly binning up the virial mass estimates and applying the @xmath37 correction , where the @xmath37 correction is the same as that used to estimate the luminosity function .",
    "however , bhmfs obtained in this manner suffer from both incompleteness caused by the sample flux limit and artificial broadening caused by the statistical error in the virial mass estimates @xcite .",
    "the incompleteness arises because there is a large range in luminosity at fixed @xmath5 , scattering some quasars at fixed @xmath5 above the flux limit and some below .",
    "the artificial broadening arises because the statistical error in the virial mass estimates scatters more quasars into bins of higher @xmath5 than lower @xmath5 when the bhmf declines toward higher values of @xmath5 . in order to account for these effects",

    "i and this paper the error distribution is modeled as a gaussian distribution with unknown variance and optionally and unknown mean . because we use fwhm - based virial mass estimates ,",
    "our model is only with respect to these mass estimates ; mass estimates based on the line dispersion or other line width measures may have a different error distribution .",
    "paper i assumed that the mass estimates were unbiased at the average luminosity as a function of @xmath5 , but that the mass estimates potentially exhibited a luminosity - dependent bias at fixed mass .",

    "the motivation for modeling the mass estimates according to equation ( [ eq - mvirial ] ) is illustrated in figure [ f - merr_illust ] .",
    "here we show the distribution of the error in the mass estimates at fixed true mass as a function of luminosity , assuming a value of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "when averaging over a broad range of luminosity , as is done for the reverberation mapping sources , the distribution of the mass estimate errors is broad .",
    "however , when limiting ourselves to a narrow luminosity range at the bright end , as in a flux - limited sample like the sdss , the mass estimates exhibit a bias and smaller scatter .",
    "this model is thus one way of reconciling the fact that the scatter in the mass estimates for the sdss imply smaller uncertainties in @xmath50 than does the scatter in the mass estimates for the reverberation mapping sample .",
    "some physical reasons to expect such a luminosity - dependent bias were further discussed in  3.2.1 of paper i. alternatively , another possibility is that the mass estimates at fixed mass and luminosity are always unbiased ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , but @xmath45 decreases toward higher luminosity .",

    "note that equation ( [ eq - bhmf ] ) is with respect to the true values of @xmath5 , and not with the respect to the virial mass estimates ; equation ( [ eq - mvirial ] ) describes how to connect the distribution of the virial mass estimates to equation ( [ eq - bhmf ] ) .    as in paper",

    "this increase in @xmath45 as the range in luminosity is increased supports our hypothesis that the dispersion in the virial mass estimate error is luminosity - dependent .",
    "these results on the luminosity - dependent bias model are similar as that obtained in paper i using a simpler model for the eddington ratio distribution , showing that many of the results of paper i are robust against the assumed eddington ratio distribution .",
    "we therefore conclude from this that either the statistical scatter in the fwhm - based broad line mass estimates is correlated with luminosity , producing a luminosity - dependent bias , or that the scatter in the mass estimates is smaller for the luminous quasars probed by the sdss , or some combination of these two possibilities . in paper i",
    "we have already discussed the implications of these results for the broad line mass estimates , and , as the focus of this paper is on the type 1 quasar black hole mass function and eddington ratio distribution , we merely note here that our earlier conclusions on the statistical properties of the broad line mass estimate errors are unchanged using a more flexible model for the eddington ratio distribution .    for the sake of brevity , in the remainder of this work we present the results obtained from the model that assumes that there is no luminosity - dependent bias , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "we do this for easier comparison with other work , as almost all studies implicitly assume that there are no systematic trends in the mass estimate errors with luminosity .",

    "in addition , extrapolation in our bhmf is unstable against small unidentified errors in both the sdss selection function and the mass estimates beyond the region where we are reasonably complete .",

    "the term @xmath166 is calculated by averaging the sdss selection function over the luminosity distribution at fixed @xmath5 ( see eq.[11 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated bhmf is highly sensitive to both the measured number of sources in a mass bin and the value of @xmath166 when @xmath166 is very small , and thus is unstable against even small errors in @xmath165 and the selection function .",
    "the type 1 quasars in the most incomplete bins tend to be those with the lowest @xmath167 spectra . because the fwhm measurement can be biased in low @xmath167 spectra @xcite , the measured number densities of the most incomplete mass bins may be incorrect due to biases in the mass estimates derived from fwhm measurements , which would scatter objects into incorrect mass bins .",
    "in addition , the sdss quasar selection function is derived via simulation by @xcite .",
    "aspects of this simulation which are not representative of the quasar population ( e.g. , lack of a host galaxy component ) can introduce errors into the quasar selection function , which are manifested as errors in @xmath166 .",

    "the comoving number density of smbhs in type 1 quasars continues to increase all the way down to the masses corresponding to the @xmath169 completeness limits , and thus we do not observe a peak in the bhmf from the sdss . instead , we constrain the peak in the type 1 quasar bhmf to occur at @xmath170 .    in figure [ f - bhmf_evol ]",
    "we show the evolution in the type 1 quasar bhmf at four different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the number densities of smbhs in type 1 quasars with @xmath171 fall off more steeply toward higher redshift at @xmath172 , while the number densities of @xmath173 fall off more steeply with decreasing redshift at @xmath174 .",
    "these trends imply that more massive black holes are more likely to be observed at higher @xmath12 in type 1 quasars than less massive ones .",
    "these trends have been called ` downsizing ' , and have been observed in previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , there is evidence for a discontinuity in the number densities across the the redshift where we switch from h@xmath44  to mgii  when calculating the mass estimates .",
    "this discontinuity may be partly driven by systematic differences in the h@xmath44- and mgii - based mass estimates .",
    "however , it is also likely driven at least in part by the contribution from a host galaxy component to the nuclear emission which boosts the number of type 1 quasars above the flux limit at @xmath175 , but is not modeled in the selection function @xcite . considering this ,",
    "it is likely that the number densities at @xmath176 are overestimated , especially at @xmath177 .    in figure [ f - bhmf_compare ]",
    "we compare the mass functions derived from both models for the error distribution in the virial mass estimates at three representative redshifts .",
    "there is little difference in the bhmfs derived from our models with and without a luminosity dependent bias in the mass estimates , with the exception that the bhmf derived from mgii  and civ  is shifted toward lower values of @xmath5 by @xmath178 dex for the model which includes a luminosity dependent bias ( i.e. , @xmath148 ) .",
    "in addition the uncertainties in the bhmf are larger when we allow for a luminosity - dependent bias .",
    "we also note that the bhmf for the @xmath148 error model is consistent with that presented in paper i , but with larger uncertainties on account of the more flexible eddington ratio distribution model .",
    "while the derived bhmf does not depend strongly on the existence of a luminosity - dependent bias , the flux - limited bhmf does depend strongly on the value of @xmath44 .",

    "our derived constrained on @xmath186 are sensitive to the prior placed on @xmath112 .",
    "this is because large value of @xmath112 imply tails in the bhmf that extend to larger value of @xmath5 , and therefore larger values of @xmath186 .",
    "if we constrain @xmath187 instead of @xmath188 , then the upper boundary of the error bars on @xmath186 extend to @xmath189@xmath190 .",
    "ideally the prior should not have a strong influence on this quantity , but unfortunately the upper flux limit for the sdss results in the extreme high mass tail of the bhmf being poorly constrained ; because of the upper flux limit , there is nothing in the data from prohibiting a small population of type 1 quasars hosting smbhs with , say , @xmath191 . considering this , we can formally only place a lower bound of @xmath192 on the maximum mass in the observable universe of a smbh in a type 1 .",

    "the reason for this is because the @xmath259 percentile in @xmath8 at fixed @xmath5 for a flux - limited sample is an overestimate of the true @xmath259 percentile due to the loss of the faint end of the population . for smaller values of @xmath5",
    "one loses a larger fraction of the lower @xmath8 part of the population , increasing the bias in the @xmath259 percentile inferred from the distribution of type 1 quasars that are actually bright enough to be detected . indeed , for the least massive black holes in a flux - limited sample one can not even detect the @xmath259 percentile of the eddington ratio distribution , as it falls below the flux limit .",
    "this leads to a spurious increase in the @xmath259 percentile of the @xmath8 distribution with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the errors of virial bh mass estimates stretch the distribution in the mass - luminosity plane along the mass direction , causing artificial flattening and an apparent `` tilt '' away from the eddington limit towards higher virial bh masses ( see fig .  8 of paper i ) , which could be incorrectly recognized as visual evidence for a sub - eddington boundary . however , we note that this effect is not as strong as the bias caused by incompleteness .    in this work",
    "we have corrected for incompleteness in flux - limited samples and errors in virial bh mass estimates , assuming our statistical model and the sdss selection function , and thus attempt to recover the true intrinsic trends in the high @xmath8 tail with @xmath5 . upon doing so",
    ", we do not find any evidence that higher mass type 1 quasars are less likely to be observed at high @xmath8 , but in fact at certain redshifts may be more likely to have high @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the observed dirth of type 1 quasars having both high @xmath5 and high @xmath8 is not caused by a change in the shape of the tail of the eddington ratio distribution , but is instead caused by the rapidly decreasing number densities of type 1 quasars toward higher masses . because the most massive smbhs in type 1 quasars are rare by definition , we would not expect those that we do observe to also occupy the rare high-@xmath8 region of the mass - luminosity plane .    at low redshift past the peak of quasar activity , the most massive smbhs are probably accreting mostly at very low eddington ratios , but are no longer shining in the form of type 1 quasars .",
    "we do not find any statistical evidence of a sub - eddington boundary in the mass - luminosity plane of type 1 quasars , and earlier claims of such a boundary are likely the result of uncorrected incompleteness .",

    "our results are consistent with a maximum value of @xmath266 across all redshift bins .",

    "finally , our estimated growth times at high redshift imply duty cycles of order unity , as it is difficult to accomodate the longer growth times required by smaller values of the duty cycle given that the estimated growth time scales are already comparable to the age of the universe at these redshifts .",

    "moreover , both the @xcite and @xcite samples are x - ray selected and contain type 2 quasars , and thus may probe a different population of objects . thus , is it unclear how inconsistent our results are compared with theirs . in addition , the broad eddington ratio distributions that we find at @xmath311 may be inconsistent with small scatter in the @xmath21@xmath312 relation inferred from clustering measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the downsizing in @xmath8 has a somewhat different form than that of @xmath5 .",
    "unlike the number densities of @xmath5 , the number densities in bins of constant @xmath8 do not show any evolution at @xmath3 .",
    "instead , we observed ` downsizing ' in @xmath8 in the sense that type 1 quasars radiating at @xmath217 are significantly more rare at @xmath315 compared to @xmath220 , while the number densities of type 1 quasars at @xmath316 are similar for @xmath206 and @xmath317 .",
    "this may reflect a stronger contribution to the bherf at @xmath318 from type 1 quasars that are further along the decaying part of the agn lightcurve , and thus at a lower @xmath8 , possibly due to a more prolonged post - peak phase .",
    "in addition , this change in the @xmath7 distribution at @xmath319 may reflect a stronger contribution of type 1 quasars that are fueled through more internal processes and experiencing weaker agn activity .",

    "accretion flows the luminosity depends logarithmically on the accretion rate , so in principle these type 1 quasars that do radiate at @xmath320 could be accreting at a significantly higher rate relative to eddington , i.e. , @xmath321",
    ".      direct comparison of our results with models of smbh fueling and growth is difficult as most models do not present a quantitative prediction of the bhmf and bherf specifically for type 1 quasars . instead",
    ", many modelers predict the bhmf and bherf for all smbhs , or for active smbhs .",
    "generically , many models predict a bhmf which increases toward lower mass down to @xmath322 , which is in agreement with our estimated bhmf .",
    "in addition , many models predict downsizing in smbh growth and agn activity , in agreement with our empirical results .",
    "@xcite compared bhmfs for type 1 quasars with models for merger driven smbh growth that assumed that either smbh seeds are the remnants of pop - iii stars or were formed through direct collapse of pre - galactic disks @xcite .",
    "they compared their model unobscured quasar bhmf to those estimated by k10 , and in general they found that the pop - iii seeding model underpredicted the bhmf at @xmath323 .",
    "their direct collapse seeding model provided a better fit at @xmath324 although it overpredicts the number densities of the most massive smbhs in type 1 quasars at @xmath220 ; however , the authors argue that the overprediction is not a problem as it results from the fact that they did not implement depletion of the available gas to grow the smbh at lower @xmath12 .",
    "none of their models were able to match the k10 bhmf at @xmath214 .",
    "because the k10 bhmf was derived from the sdss dr3 , which is a subset of our sample , it is not greatly different from the bhmf that we derive here . as such",
    ", the conclusions reached by @xcite would be unchanged using our newer bhmf , although we note that comparison with our new bhmf implies that all of their models underpredict our derived number densities of smbhs in type 1 quasars with @xmath289 at @xmath325 .",
    "the most massive smbhs in the observable universe implied by our bhmf have masses @xmath326@xmath327 , consistent with earlier results obtained by k10 .",
    "however , as this value is strongly dependent on our prior for the extreme high mass tail of the bhmf , a more realistic constraint is @xmath328 .",
    "recently @xcite detected two smbhs in the local universe with @xmath329 determined from stellar dynamical modeling .",
    "considering the different volumes probed by the sdss dr7 and their search , their results are consistent with the limits on the maximum mass implied by our bhmf .",
    "in addition , the lower limits on the maximum masses that we infer are consistent with values predicted from models that assume the smbh s growth is self - regulated @xcite .",
    "simulations that follow the growth of smbhs in bright @xmath330 quasars have also been able to grow smbhs to @xmath331 by @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "while we have obtained a number of interesting results , there are a few caveats regarding our approach that must be kept in mind , and we conclude this section with a discussion of them .",
    "there are three significant potential sources of systematic error in our approach , which we have touched on earlier : incorrect specification of the virial mass error distribution and bias , errors in the sdss selection function , and errors in the bolometeric correction . in this work",
    "we have used a simple constant bolometeric correction to the 2500  luminosity , and , strictly speaking , our derived bherf should be viewed as the number density of type 1 quasars radiating at a given ratio of optical luminosity to eddington , scaled upward by a constant factor of five . because the bolometeric correction likely depends on both @xmath5 and @xmath8 this will create systematic errors .",
    "it is unclear how these systematics in the bolometeric correction affect our results on the bherf . in principle",
    "it is possible to incorporate a variable bolometeric correction into our bayesian model , but unfortunately there is considerable uncertainty in the distribution of bolometeric corrections as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath8 .    as discussed in   [ s - mbh_ndens ] and",
    "  [ s - erat_ndens ] systematic errors on the selection function can have a significant effect on our results in highly incomplete regions of parameter space .",
    "in general we have limited our analysis to masses or eddington ratios in which we are not highly incomplete ( i.e. , completeness @xmath168 ) , so we do not expect small errors in the selection function to have a significant effect on our results . however , this is not true in the redshift bins corresponding to @xmath332 . in these bins",
    "the sdss selection algorithm has difficulty distinguishing quasars from stars , and as a result these bins are highly incomplete .",
    "moreover , the distribution of quasar colors obtained from the simulations used to estimate the selection function do not perfectly match the observed distributions , and the selection algorithm is color - dependent at these redshifts .",
    "we do not include a color - dependence in the selection function , and , because the quasar sed depends on @xmath5 and @xmath7 , this likely introduces systematic errors into our incompleteness correction . because of this the bhmf and bherf derived at these redshifts should be interpreted with caution .",
    "the most important possible source of systematic error in our approach arises from incorrectly specifying the error distribution of the virial mass estimates .",
    "this is particularly a concern for mgii  and civ , which are not as well studied with respect to the reverberation mapping database as h@xmath44 .",
    "in addition , civ  emission is thought to at least partly arise from an accretion disk wind and may contain a non - virial component to the line width ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , although it is currently unclear if this creates a significant bias in the civ - based mass estimates .",
    "we have tried to incorporate some systematic errors resulting from a bias in the virial mass estimates to the extant that it can be modeled as having a simple luminosity - dependence .",
    "there were no significant differences in our main scientific conclusions when we included a simple luminosity - dependent bias .",
    "in addition , we have tried to mitigate the affects of some objects having large systematic errors in the mass estimates through our use of a student s @xmath25-distribution as a model for the measurement errors on the mass estimates , which downweights any outliers .",
    "in general , the number densities of the virial mass estimates obtained before correcting for incompleteness do not show discontinuities across redshift bins when switching emission lines ( paper i ) . however , there are a few discontinuities in the derived mass and eddington ratio functions when switching between emission lines , suggesting that small systematics between the virial mass estimates of different emission lines may be manifested more strongly in our derived bhmf and bherf .",
    "these include a discontinuity in the normalization of the bhmf when going from h@xmath44  to mgii  ( figure [ f - bhmf_evol ] ) , a discontinuity in the bherf when going from mgii  to civ  ( figure [ f - bherf_evol ] ) , and differences in the distribution of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath5 inferred from the three emission lines ( figure [ f - cprob_erat ] ) . while it may be tempting to conclude from this that one or more of the emission lines do not give consistent results , this is not necessarily the case . as discussed in   [ s - mbh_ndens ] , the increase in number densities in the redshift bins using h@xmath44  is likely at least in part caused by a host galaxy contribution to the nuclear emission which is not accounted for in the selection function , creating an excess of agn in these redshift bins as their nuclear emission gets boosted above the flux limit .",
    "the discontinuity in the number densities across @xmath206 , corresponding to the shift from mgii  to civ , also corresponds to a transition in the selection function to redshifts where quasar colors are similar to star colors . as discussed above and in ",
    "[ s - erat_ndens ] this can lead to significant systematic error in the incompleteness correction ; indeed , these redshift bins have the largest statistical errors as well .    the only systematic differences between the emission lines in the inferred distribution which can not be explained as systematics from incorrect incompleteness correction is the anomalous behavior of the eddington ratio distribution at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 is independent of @xmath5 for the two bins employing h@xmath44 , shifts toward larger values of @xmath8 with increasing @xmath5 for the redshift bins employing mgii , and then shifts to being independent of @xmath5 again over the redshift bins employing civ . although it has been argued that civ  is less reliable than mgii  or h@xmath44  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in this case it is mgii  which gives the discrepant result .",
    "it is unclear why this is the case , and it may be that this observed trend represents real evolution in the joint distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , we consider it likely that unidentified systematics are at least in part driving this trend . because of this",
    ", our current understanding of virial mass estimates may not provide enough accuracy for inferring how percentiles of the type 1 quasar joint distribution vary in the mass - luminosity plane .",
    "in this work we have employed a bayesian analysis method to derive the black hole mass and eddington ratio functions for broad line agn using a uniformly - selected sample from the sdss dr7 .",
    "we used more flexible models than those in paper i to test the robustness of the key conclusions of paper i , and found that the main results in paper i remain valid , although the constraints are weakened due to the more flexible models used in the current work .",
    "our conclusions are summarized as follows :    * the sdss is @xmath333 complete at @xmath334 or @xmath2 , with some variation with redshift . decreasing the magnitude limits to @xmath207 , similar to that of the _ cosmos _ spectroscopic surveys or the _ pan - starrs _ medium - deep fields , reduces the mass and eddington ratio incompleteness limits by about an order of magnitude .",
    "* there are a broad range of @xmath5 and @xmath8 for type 1 quasars , and there is no evidence for a peak in the black hole mass or eddington ratio functions down to the @xmath158 completeness limits of the sdss sample .",
    "the number densities of type 1 quasars continue to increase toward lower @xmath5 and @xmath8 down to at least @xmath247 and @xmath335 , respectively . *",
    "both the bhmf and bherf show evidence for downsizing .",
    "relative to the peak in the number densities at @xmath206 , the number densities of the most massive black holes in type 1 quasars fall off fastest toward lower redshift , while the number densities of the less massive black holes fall off faster toward higher @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that the most massive black holes were active first , and shut off their activity more rapidly after the peak .",
    "+ the number densities of type 1 quasars are approximately constant at @xmath336 for @xmath216 ; however , the number densities of type 1 quasars radiating at @xmath217 fall off more rapidly toward higher redshift at @xmath172 , possibly reflecting a smaller contribution from weaker agn activity toward higher redshift . *",
    "we constrain the maximum value of @xmath8 in a type 1 quasar to be @xmath22 . therefore ,",
    "if quasars do violate the eddington limit , they do so only mildly and for a short period of time .",
    "* at low @xmath337 and high @xmath338 redshifts the eddington ratio distribution at fixed @xmath5 is approximately independent of @xmath5 .",
    "however , at redshifts @xmath252 @xmath339 shifts toward higher values of @xmath8 from @xmath243 to @xmath238 .",
    "this therefore implies that at intermediate redshifts the shape of the eddington ratio distribution changes such that the high @xmath8 tail becomes more dominant at higher @xmath5 . at low and high @xmath12",
    "the shape of the high @xmath8 tail of the eddington ratio distribution is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the redshift dependence of this trend is unexpected and may be due to unidentified systematics among the emission lines used to calculate the fwhm - based virial mass estimates .",
    "* we do not find statistical evidence for the so - called `` sub - eddington boundary '' in the quasar mass - luminosity plane claimed by @xcite .",
    "the appearance of such a boundary in the `` observed '' distribution is caused by selection effects and errors in the virial bh mass estimates ( paper i ) .",
    "this reinforces our early conclusions in paper i that one should not interpret the observed distribution directly . * assuming a radiative efficiency of @xmath279 and a seed black hole mass of @xmath282 , the growth times for smbhs in type 1 quasars having @xmath340 are comparable to or longer than the age of the universe at @xmath341 . here , the growth times were calculated assuming that smbhs in a given mass bin accrete at a time - averaged rate that is equal to the mean eddington ratio in that mass bin .",
    "these large growth times imply that prior to us observing them as type 1 quasars , these smbhs experienced a stage of accelerated growth ( i.e. , with higher eddington ratios ) .",
    "* comparison of the @xmath5 completeness limits of our sample with the local mass function of all smbhs implies that our sample is dominated by smbhs representing the high mass end of the bhmf , which reside in what are locally early type galaxies .",
    "this conclusion in combination with our results on smbh growth times , is consistent with models by which smbhs experience a massive fueling event which initiates obscured growth . the black hole s growth is self - regulated , persisting until either feedback energy unbinds the obscuring gas or all of the gas is consumed from star - formation , briefly revealing the massive black hole as a type 1 quasar with a decaying lightcurve .",
    "this same fueling event leaves behind a spheroid , placing the smbh on the @xmath5@xmath6 relationship .",
    "because the smbhs in our sample represent the high mass end of bhmf , this process may only be common among this mass range .",
    "in addition , the long growth times of @xmath176 type 1 quasars with massive bhs and low eddington ratios likely represent weaker agn activity reignited by mass loss from evolved stellar populations .",
    "the combination of our large uniformly - selected sample with our powerful bayesian method represents an important contribution to agn demographic studies , and we have used our sample and method in a two - paper series to obtain constraints on the optical luminosity function , black hole mass function , and black hole eddington ratio functions of type 1 quasars .",
