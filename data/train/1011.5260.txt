    "blazars constitute a subclass of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , in which a jet of magnetized plasma assumed to emanate with relativistic bulk velocity from close to a central supermassive black hole points almost along the line of sight .",
    "the broadband emission spectra of these objects are dominated by non - thermal , strongly doppler - boosted and variable radiation produced in the innermost part of the jet .",
    "most of the identified extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources detected with the egret instrument ( hartman et al . 1999 ) on board the _ compton _ gamma ray observatory belong to this category .",
    "blazars include flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) .",
    "even though blazars have been observed for several decades at different frequencies , the existing experimental data did not permit unambiguous identification of the physical mechanisms responsible for the production of their high - energy ( @xmath0-ray ) emission .",
    "given the existing high - sensitivity detectors which allow detailed study of the low - energy ( synchrotron ) component of blazar sources ( extending from radio up to hard x - rays ) , one of the reasons for the incomplete understanding of those objects was only moderate sensitivity of previous @xmath0-ray instruments .",
    "this often precluded detailed cross - correlation studies between the low- and high - energy emission and did not provide enough constraints on the parameters of the theoretical models .",
    "some of the open and fundamental questions regarding blazar sources are ( i ) the content of their jets , ( ii ) the location and structure of their dominant emission zones , ( iii ) the origin of their variability , observed on timescales from minutes to tens of years , ( iv ) the role of external photon fields ( including the extragalactic background light , ebl ) in shaping their observed @xmath0-ray spectra , and ( v ) the energy distribution and the dominant acceleration mechanism for the underlying radiating particles .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) instrument @xcite on board the _ fermi _  gamma - ray space telescope satellite provides a large improvement in the experimental capability for performing @xmath0-ray astronomy , and hence it is shedding new light on the blazar phenomenon . in this paper",
    ", we report on the _ fermi _  observations of the tev - emitting high - frequency - peaked  or , according to a more recent classification @xcite , high - synchrotron - peaked ( hsp )  bl lac object markarian501 ( mrk501 ; ra=16@xmath11 45@xmath12 52.22@xmath13 , dec=",
    "39@xmath14 45 36.6 \" , j2000 , redshift @xmath15 ) , which is one of the brightest extragalactic sources in the x - ray / tev sky .",
    "mrk 501 was the second extragalactic object ( after markarian421 ) identified as a very high energy ( thereafter vhe ) @xmath0-ray emitter @xcite . after a phase of moderate emission lasting for about a year following its discovery ( 1996 ) , mrk501 went into a state of surprisingly high activity and strong variability , becoming @xmath1610 times brighter than the crab nebula at energies @xmath17tev , as reported by various instruments / groups @xcite . in 1998 - 1999 , the mean vhe @xmath0-ray flux dropped by an order of magnitude , and the overall vhe spectrum softened significantly @xcite . in 2005 , @xmath0-ray flux variability on minute timescales",
    "was observed in the vhe band , thus establishing mrk501 as one of the sources with the fastest @xmath0-ray flux changes @xcite . during the 2005 vhe flux variations (",
    "when mrk501 was 34 times dimmer than it was in 1997 ) , significant spectral variability was detected as well , with a clear `` harder when brighter '' behavior .",
    "those spectral variations are even more pronounced when compared with the spectrum measured during the low activity level recently reported in @xcite .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the multifrequency correlations of mrk501 have been intensively studied in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the nature of this object is still far from being understood .",
    "the main reasons for this lack of knowledge are the sparse multifrequency data during long periods of time , and the moderate sensitivity available in the past to study the @xmath0-ray emission of this source . besides",
    ", most of the previous multifrequency campaigns were triggered by an enhanced flux level in some energy band , and hence much of our information about the source is biased towards `` high - activity '' states , where perhaps distinct physical processes play a dominant role . in addition , until now we knew very little about the gev emission of mrk501 . the only detection reported at gev energies before _",
    "fermi _  was in @xcite , but the significance of this detection was too low to include mrk501 in the 3rd egret catalog @xcite .",
    "moreover , mrk501 was not detected by egret during the large x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray flare which lasted for several months in 1997 @xcite .",
    "the large improvement in the performance provided by the _ fermi_-lat  compared with its predecessor , egret , provides us with a new perspective for the study of blazars like mrk501 . however , it is important to emphasize that blazars can vary their emitted power by one or two orders of magnitude on short timescales , and that they emit radiation over the entire observable electromagnetic spectrum ( from @xmath18ev up to @xmath19ev ) .",
    "for this reason , the information from _",
    "fermi_-lat  alone is not enough to understand the broadband emission of mrk501 , and hence simultaneous data in other frequency ranges are required . in particular ,",
    "the frequency ranges where the low- and high - energy spectral components peak in the sed representation are of major importance . in the case of mrk501 ,",
    "those peaks are typically located around @xmath20kev ( low - energy bump ) and @xmath21gev ( high - energy bump ) , and hence simultaneous uv / x - ray and gev / tev observations are essential for the proper reconstruction of the overall sed of mrk501 . at tev energies",
    "there has been a substantial improvement in the instrumental capability as a result of the deployment of a new generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) . in particular , for the study of mrk501 , the new telescope systems magic and veritas provide greater sensitivity , wider energy range and improved energy resolution compared with the previous generation of instruments .",
    "simultaneous observations with _",
    "fermi_-lat  and iacts like magic or veritas ( potentially covering six decades in energy , from @xmath10mev to @xmath10tev ) can , for the first time , significantly resolve both the rising and the falling segments of the high - energy emission component of mrk501 , with the expected location of the sed peak in the overlapping energy range between those instruments .",
    "because of the smaller collection area , and the self - veto problem5  gev ) due to backsplash of secondary particles from the calorimeter causing the anticoincidence system to veto the event",
    ". this problem is substantially reduced in lat by using a segmented anticoincidence detector . ] , the sensitivity of egret to detect @xmath0-rays with energies larger than 10 gev was about two orders of magnitude lower than that of _ fermi_-lat . besides , during the period of operation of egret , the sensitivity of the previous generation of iacts was only moderate , with relatively low sensitivity below @xmath22tev .",
    "therefore , the higher sensitivity and larger energy range of the newer @xmath0-ray instruments has become a crucial tool for studying mrk501 , and the blazar phenomenon in general .    in order to exploit the performance of the _ fermi_-lat  and the new iacts , as well as the capabilities of several existing instruments observing at radio - to - x - ray frequencies , a multifrequency ( from radio to tev photon energies ) campaign",
    "was organized to monitor mrk501 during a period of 4.5 months , from mid - march to august 2009 .",
    "the scientific goal was to collect a very complete , simultaneous , multifrequency data set that would allow current theoretical models of broadband blazar emission to be tested .",
    "this , in turn , should help us to understand the origin of high - energy emission of blazar sources and the physical mechanisms responsible for the acceleration of radiating particles in relativistic jets in general . in this paper ,",
    "the only reported result from the multifrequency observations is the overall sed averaged over the duration of the observing campaign .",
    "a more in - depth analysis of the multifrequency data set will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the scientific results from the data collected during the two - day time interval 2009 march 23 - 25 ( which includes extensive observations with the suzaku x - ray satellite ) will be reported in a separate paper @xcite .",

    "the _ fermi_-lat  is an instrument to perform @xmath0-ray astronomy above @xmath10mev .",
    "the instrument is an array of @xmath24 identical towers , each one consisting of a tracker ( where the photons are pair - converted ) and a calorimeter ( where the energies of the pair - converted photons are measured ) . the entire instrument is covered with an anticoincidence detector to reject charged - particle background .",
    "the lat has a peak effective area of @xmath25m@xmath26 for @xmath20gev photons , an energy resolution typically better than @xmath27 and a field of view ( fov ) of about @xmath28sr , with an angular resolution ( @xmath29 containment angle ) better than @xmath30 for energies above @xmath20gev .",
    "further details on the lat can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lat data reported in this paper were collected from 2008 august 5 ( mjd 54683 ) to 2009 november 27 ( mjd 55162 ) . during this time ,",
    "the _ fermi_-lat  instrument operated mostly in survey mode .",
    "the analysis was performed with the fermi science tools software package version ` v9r15p6 ` .",
    "only events with the highest probability of being photons  those in the `` diffuse '' class  were used .",
    "the lat data were extracted from a circular region of @xmath31 radius centered at the location of mrk501 .",
    "the spectral fits were performed using photon energies in the energy range @xmath32gev . at photon energies above 0.3 gev",
    "the effective area of the instrument is relatively large ( @xmath33m@xmath34 ) and the angular resolution relatively good ( @xmath29 containment angle smaller than @xmath35 ) . in particular , because of the better angular resolution , the spectral fits using energies above @xmath4gev ( instead of @xmath36gev ) are less sensitive to possible contamination from unaccounted ( perhaps transient ) , neighboring @xmath0-ray sources and hence have smaller systematic errors , at the expense of reducing somewhat the number of photons from the source . in addition , a cut on zenith angle ( @xmath37 ) was applied to reduce contamination from earth - albedo @xmath0-rays , which are produced by cosmic rays interacting with the upper atmosphere .    the background model used to extract the @xmath0-ray signal includes a galactic diffuse emission component and an isotropic component .",
    "the model that we adopted for the galactic component is ` gll_iem_v02.fit ` .",
    "the isotropic component , which is the sum of the extragalactic diffuse emission and the residual charged - particle background , is parametrized here with a single power - law function . to reduce systematic uncertainties in the analysis",
    ", the photon index of the isotropic component and the normalization of both components in the background model were allowed to vary freely during the spectral point fitting .",
    "owing to the relatively small size of the region analyzed ( radius 10@xmath14 ) and the hardness of the spectrum of mrk501 , the high - energy structure in the standard tabulated isotropic background spectrum isotropic_iem_v02.txt does not dominate the total counts at high energies .",
    "in addition we find that for this region a power - law approximation to the isotropic background results in somewhat smaller residuals for the overall model , possibly because the isotropic term , with a free spectral index , compensates for an inaccuracy in the model for the galactic diffuse emission , which is also approximately isotropic at the high galactic latitude of mrk501 ( @xmath38 ) . in any case , the resulting spectral fits for mrk501 are not significantly different if isotropic_iem_v02.txt is used for the analysis .",
    "in addition , the model also includes five nearby sources from the 1fgl catalog @xcite : 1fglj1724.0 + 4002 , 1fglj1642.5 + 3947 , 1fglj1635.0 + 3808 , 1fglj1734.4 + 3859 , and 1fglj1709.6 + 4320 .",
    "the spectra of those sources were also parameterized by a power - law functions , whose photon index values were fixed to the values from the 1fgl catalog , and only the normalization factors for the single sources were left as free parameters .",

    "these are shown in figure[fig : sed_30day ] , together with the sed plots from the 30-day time intervals before and after this 120-day epoch , which are representative of the average source behaviour during the other 360 days .",
    "the variability of the sed data points below a few gev is rather mild ( factor of two ) , but above a few gev the spectra vary substantially ( factor of ten ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray signal at the highest energies is suppressed during mjd 5486254982 , while it increases by a large factor during mjd 5495254982 , where the analysis model for mrk501 predicts 2.0 photons in the energy range @xmath89gev .",
    "it is worth stressing that for the sed from figure[fig : sed ] , which corresponds to the total exposure of 480 days , the analysis model for mrk501 predicts only 3.2 photons in the highest energy bin .",
    "hence the time interval mjd 5495254982 holds almost all the signal detected by lat in the energy range @xmath89gev during 16 months .",

    "fortunately , the 30-day time interval characterized by hard spectrum is covered by the 4.5-month campaign that we organized , and hence simultaneous multifrequency observations ( radio to tev ) are available for this particular period , as discussed further below .",
    "as mentioned in  [ intro ] , we organized a multifrequency campaign ( from radio to tev photon energies ) to monitor mrk501 during a time period of 4.5 months .",
    "the observing campaign started on march 15 , 2009 ( mjd 54905 ) and finished on august 01 , 2009 ( mjd 55044 ) .",
    "the observing goal for this campaign was to sample the broadband emission of mrk501 every 5 days , which was largely accomplished whenever the weather and/or technical limitations allowed .",
    "the underlying scientific goal has already been outlined in  1 . a detailed analysis of the multifrequency variability and correlations , as well as the evolution of the overall spectral energy distribution with time ,",
    "will be reported in a forthcoming paper . in this section of the manuscript",
    ", we describe the source coverage during the campaign and the data analysis for several of the participating instruments , and we report on the averaged sed resulting from the campaign .",
    "the modeling of these data and the physical implications are given in ",
    "[ sedmodel ] and  [ discussion ] below , respectively .      the list of all the instruments that participated in the campaign is given in table[tablewithinstruments ] , and the scheduled observations can be found online . in some cases the planned observations could not be performed due to bad observing conditions , while in some other occasions the observations were performed but the data could not be properly analyzed due to technical problems or rapidly changing weather conditions . in order to quantify the actual time and energy coverage during the campaign on mrk501 , figure[fig : timeenergycoverage ] shows the exposure time as a function of the energy range for the instruments / observations used to produce the sed shown in figure[fig : mwsed ] . apart from the unprecedented energy coverage ( including , for the first time , the gev energy range from _",
    "fermi_-lat ) , the source was sampled quite uniformly with the various instruments participating in the campaign and , consequently , it is reasonable to consider the sed constructed below as the actual average ( typical ) sed of mrk501 during the time interval covered by this multifrequency campaign .",
    "the largest non - uniformity in the sampling of the source comes from the cherenkov telescopes , which are the instruments most sensitive to weather conditions .",
    "moreover , while there are many radio / optical instruments spread all over the globe , there are only three cherenkov telescope observatories in the northern hemisphere we could utilize ( magic , veritas , whipple ) .",
    "hence , the impact of observing conditions was more important to the coverage at the vhe @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "we note that figure[fig : timeenergycoverage ] shows the magic , veritas and whipple coverage at vhe @xmath0-ray energies , but only the magic and veritas observations were used to produce the spectra shown in figure[fig : mwsed ] .",
    "the more extensive ( 120 hr ) , but less sensitive , whipple data ( shown as grey boxes in figure[fig : timeenergycoverage ] ) were primarily taken to determine the light curve @xcite and a re - optimization was required to derive the spectrum which will be reported elsewhere .        in the following paragraphs",
    "we briefly discuss the procedures used in the data analysis of the instruments participating in the campaign .",
    "the analysis of the _ fermi_-lat  data was described in  [ fermidata ] and",

    "since the vlba angular resolution is smaller than the radio source extension , measurements were performed for the most compact core region , as well as for the total radio structure at parsec scales .",
    "the vlba core size was determined with two - dimensional circular or elliptical gaussian fits to the measured visibilities .",

    "therefore , _",
    "fermi_-lat  may have measured high activity that was missed by the other instruments .",
    "indeed , the 2.4-hour high - flux spectrum from veritas depicted in figure[fig : mwsed ] ( which was obtained during the 3-day interval mjd 54952.954955.9 ) demonstrates that , during the multifrequency campaign , there were time periods with substantially ( factor of five ) higher tev activity .",
    "it is possible that the highest - energy lat observations ( @xmath14750 gev ) include high tev flux states which occurred while the iacts were not observing .",
    "if the flaring activity occurred only at the highest photon energies , then the computed _ fermi_-lat  flux ( @xmath160.3gev ) would not change very much and the effect might only be visible in the measured power - law photon index .",

    "this constitutes a substantial difference with respect to previous works .",
    "the resulting constraints on the physical parameters of the source , together with several limitations of the applied scenario , are discussed further down in the next sections .",
    "we want to note that modeling of the average blazar sed based on a scenario assuming steady - state homogenous emission zone could be an over - simplification of the problem .",
    "the blazar emission may be produced in an inhomogeneous region , involving stratification of the emitting plasma both along and accross a relativistic outflow .",
    "in such a case , the observed radiative output of a blazar could be due to a complex superposition of different emission zones characterized by very different parameters and emission properties .",
    "some first attempts to approach this problem in a more quantitative way have been already discussed in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main drawback of the proposed models , however , is the increased number of free parameters ( over the simplest homogeneous one - zone scenario ) , what reduces considerably the predictive power of the modeling .",
    "that is particularly problematic if a `` limited '' ( in a time and energy coverage ) dataset is considered in the modeling .",
    "only a truly simultaneous multifrequency dataset covering a large fraction of the available electromagnetic spectrum and a wide range of timescales  like the one collected during this and future campaigns which will be further exploited in forthcoming publications  will enable to test such more sophisticated and possibly more realistic blazar emission models in a time - deoendent manner .",
    "let us assume that the emitting region is a homogeneous and roughly spherically symmetric moving blob , with radius @xmath98 and comoving volume @xmath156 .",
    "for this , we evaluate the comoving synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton emissivities , @xmath157 , assuming isotropic distributions of ultrarelativistic electrons and synchrotron photons in the rest frame of the emitting region .",
    "thus , we use the exact synchrotron and inverse - compton kernels ( the latter one valid in both thomson and klein - nishina regimes ) , as given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . the intrinsic monochromatic synchrotron and ssc luminosities are then @xmath158 , while the observed monochromatic flux densities ( measured in erg@xmath48s@xmath7 ) can be found as @xmath159_{\\nu ' = \\nu \\ , ( 1+z)/\\delta } \\simeq { 4 \\pi \\ , \\delta^4 r^3 \\over 3 \\",

    "in fact , the broadband data set for mrk501 requires two different electron break energies , and hence we take the electron energy distribution in a form @xmath165 & { \\rm for } & \\gamma_{br,\\,2 } \\leq \\gamma \\end{array } \\right .",

    "however , some smoothly curved spectral shape might perhaps be an alternative representation of the electron spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model adopted is thus characterized by four main free parameters ( @xmath167 , @xmath98 , @xmath160 , and @xmath168 ) , plus seven additional ones related to the electron energy distribution ( @xmath163 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath164 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 ) .",
    "these seven additional parameters are determined by the spectral shape of the non - thermal emission continuum probed by the observations , predominantly by the spectral shape of the synchrotron bump ( rather than the inverse - compton bump ) , and depend only slightly on the particular choice of the magnetic field @xmath167 and the doppler factor @xmath160 within the allowed range . ] .",
    "there is a substantial degeneracy regarding the four main free parameters : the average emission spectrum of mrk501 may be fitted by different combinations of @xmath167 , @xmath98 , @xmath160 , and @xmath168 with little variation in the shape of the electron energy distribution .",

    "we can attempt to reduce this degeneracy by assuming that the observed main variability timescale is related to the size of the emission region and its doppler factor according to the formula @xmath175 the multifrequency data collected during the 4.5-month campaign ( see  [ mwsed ] ) allows us to study the variability of mrk501 on timescales from months to a few days .",
    "we found that , during this time period , the multifrequency activity varied typically on a timescale of @xmath176 days , with the exception of a few particular epochs when the source became very active in vhe @xmath0-rays , and flux variations with timescales of a day or shorter were found at tev energies .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to stress that several authors concluded in the past that the dominant emission site of mrk501 is characterized by variability timescales longer than one day ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comprehensive study of the mrk501 variability in x - rays ) , and that the power in the intraday flickering of this source is small , in agreement with the results of our campaign .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that this object is known for showing sporadic but extreme changes in its activity that can give flux variations on timescales as short as a few minutes @xcite . in this work we aim to model the average / typical behaviour of mrk501 ( corresponding to the 4.5-month campaign ) rather than specific / short periods with outstanding activity , and",
    "hence we constrained the minimum ( typical ) variability timescale @xmath177 in the model to the range @xmath178 days .    even with @xmath177 fixed as discussed above , the reconstructed sed of mrk501",
    "may be fitted by different combinations of @xmath167 , @xmath98 , @xmath160 , and @xmath168 .",
    "such a degeneracy between the main model parameters is an inevitable feature of the ssc modeling of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is therefore necessary to impose additional constraints on the physical parameters of the dominant emission zone . here",
    "we argue that such constraints follow from the requirement for the electron energy distribution to be in agreement with the one resulting from the simplest prescription of the energy evolution of the radiating electrons within the emission region , as discussed below .",
    "the idea of separating the sites for the particle acceleration and emission processes is commonly invoked in modeling different astrophysical sources of high - energy radiation , and blazar jets in particular .",
    "such a procedure is not always justified , because interactions of ultrarelativistic particles with the magnetic field ( leading to particle diffusion and convection in momentum space ) are generally accompanied by particle radiative losses ( and vice versa ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the characteristic timescale for energy gains is much shorter than the timescales for radiative cooling ( @xmath179 ) or escape ( @xmath180 ) from the system , the particle acceleration processes may be indeed approximated as being ` instantaneous ' , and may be modeled by a single injection term @xmath181 in the simplified version of the kinetic equation @xmath182   - { n_e(\\gamma ) \\over t'_{esc } } + { \\dot q}(\\gamma ) \\label{eq : kin}\\ ] ] describing a very particular scenario for the energy evolution of the radiating ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "it is widely believed that the above equation is a good approximation for the energy evolution of particles undergoing diffusive ( ` first - order fermi ' ) shock acceleration , and cooling radiatively in the downstream region of the shock .",
    "in such a case , the term @xmath181 specifies the energy spectrum and the injection rate of the electrons freshly accelerated at the shock front and not affected by radiative losses , while the escape term corresponds to the energy - independent dynamical timescale for the advection of the radiating particles from the downstream region of a given size @xmath98 , namely @xmath183 .",
    "the steady - state electron energy distribution is then very roughly @xmath184 below the critical energy for which @xmath185 , and @xmath186 above this energy .",
    "note that in the case of a power - law injection @xmath187 and a homogeneous emission region with dominant radiative losses of the synchrotron type , @xmath188 , the injected electron spectrum is expected to steepen by @xmath189 above the critical ` cooling break ' energy .",
    "this provides us with the additional constraint on the free model parameters for mrk501 : namely , we require that the position of the second break in the electron energy distribution needed to fit the reconstructed sed , @xmath190 , should correspond to the location of the cooling break for a given chosen set of the model free parameters .",
    "figure[fit1 ] ( black curves ) shows the resulting ssc model fit ( summarized in table  2 ) to the averaged broadband emission spectrum of mrk501 , which was obtained for the following parameters : @xmath191 g , @xmath192 cm , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 .",

    "a satisfactory fit could be obtained with those modified parameters , but only when we relaxed the requirement for the electron energy distribution to be in agreement with the one following from the steady - state solution to equation [ eq : kin ] , and in particular the resulting constraint for the second break in the electron spectrum to be equal the cooling break .",

    "the vlba size estimation is the fwhm of a gaussian representing the brightness distribution of the blob , which could be approximated as 0.9 times the radius of a corresponding spherical blob @xcite .",

    "in addition to this , in the modeling we also aimed at matching the sub - millimeter flux of mrk501 , given at the observed frequency of @xmath95ghz , assuming that it represents the low - frequency tail of the optically - thin synchrotron blazar component .",
    "one should emphasize in this context that it is not clear if the blazar emission zone is in general located deep within the millimeter photosphere , or not .",
    "however , the broadband variability of luminous blazars of the fsrq type indicates that there is a significant overlap of the blazar zone with a region where the jet becomes optically thin at millimeter wavelengths ( as discussed by * ? ? ? * for the particular case of the blazar 3c454.3 ) .",

    "a possible reason for mismatch between the average _ fermi_-lat  spectrum and the one from magic / veritas was discussed in  [ mwseddataresults ] .",
    "in this section we discuss some of the implications of the model results presented above . after a brief analysis of the global parameters of the source resulting from the ssc fits (  [ sedfit ] ) , the discussion focuses on two topics .",
    "firstly (  [ eed ] ) , we show that the characteristics of the electron energy distribution emerging from our modeling can be used to constrain the physical processes responsible for the particle acceleration in mrk501 , processes which may also be at work in other bl lac type objects .",
    "secondly (  [ sedvariability ] ) , we examine the broadband variability of mrk501 in the framework of the model .",
    "the values for the emission region size @xmath233 cm and the jet doppler factor @xmath193 emerging from our ssc model fit give a minimum ( typical ) variability timescale of @xmath234days , which is consistent with the variability observed during the campaign and with previous studies of the x - ray activity of mrk501 @xcite . at this point",
    ", it is necessary to determine whether an emission region characterized by these values of @xmath98 and @xmath160 is optically thin to internal two - photon pair creation @xmath235 for the highest tev energies observed during the campaign .",
    "we now affirm pair transparency due to insufficient density of soft target photons .",
    "since mrk501 is a cosmologically local object , pair conversion in the ebl is not expected to prevent its multi - tev photons from reaching the earth , although the impact of this process is not negligible , as mentioned in  [ mwsed ] .",
    "therefore , dealing with a nearby source allows us to focus mostly on the intrinsic absorption processes , rather than on the cosmological , ebl - related , attenuation of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "moreover , because of the absence ( or weakness ) of accretion - disk - related circumnuclear photon fields in bl lac objects like mrk501 , we only need to consider photon - photon pair production involving photon fields internal to the jet emission site .",
    "the analysis is therefore simpler than in the case of fsrqs , where the attenuation of high - energy @xmath0-ray fluxes is dominated by interactions with photon fields external to the jet  such as those provided by the broad line regions or tori  for which the exact spatial distribution is still under debate .",
    "pair - creation optical depths can be estimated as follows . using the @xmath160-function approximation for the photon - photon annihilation cross - section @xcite , @xmath236 $ ]",
    ", the corresponding optical depth for a @xmath0-ray photon with observed energy @xmath237 interacting with a jet - originating soft photon with observed energy @xmath238 may be found as @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the differential comoving number density of soft photons . noting that @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the intrinsic monochromatic luminosity at photon energy @xmath243 , we obtain @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the observed monochromatic flux energy density as measured at the observed photon energy @xmath246 .",
    "thus , for @xmath96tev @xmath0-rays and the model parameters discussed ( implying the observed @xmath247ev flux of mrk501 roughly @xmath248ergs@xmath7@xmath48 ) , one has @xmath249 .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath98 and @xmath160 from our ssc model fit do not need to be adjusted to take into account the influence of spectral modifications due to pair attenuation .",
    "note that such opacity effects , studied extensively in the context of @xmath0-ray bursts , generally yield a broken power law for the spectral form , with the position and magnitude of the break fixed by the pair - production kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the broad - band continuum of mrk501 , and in particular its relatively flat spectrum vhe @xmath0-ray segment , is inconsistent with such expected break .",
    "this deduction is in agreement with the above derived transparency of the emitting region for high energy @xmath0-ray photons .",
    ", as a function of the electron lorentz factor @xmath0 ( solid black curve ) . for comparison ,",
    "the comoving energy density of the magnetic field @xmath250 ( solid red line ) and synchrotron photons @xmath251 ( dotted blue line ) are shown .",
    "the dashed blue curve denotes the comoving energy density of synchrotron photons which are inverse - compton upscattered in the thomson regime , @xmath252 , for a given electron lorentz factor @xmath0 ( see equation [ eq : usyncthomson ] ) . ]",
    "next we evaluated the ` monoenergetic ' comoving energy density of ultrarelativistic electrons for a given electron lorentz factor , @xmath253 and this is shown in figure[u ] ( solid black line ) .",
    "the total electron energy density is then @xmath254erg@xmath255 .",
    "as shown , most of the energy is stored in the lowest energy particles ( @xmath256 ) . for comparison , the comoving energy density of the magnetic field and that of the synchrotron photons are plotted in the figure as well ( horizontal solid red line and dotted blue line , respectively )",
    "these two quantities are approximately equal , namely @xmath257erg@xmath255 and @xmath258 in figure[u ] we also plot the comoving energy density of synchrotron photons which are inverse - compton upscattered in the thomson regime for a given electron lorentz factor @xmath0 , @xmath259 ( dashed blue line ) , where @xmath260 . because of the well - known suppression of the inverse - compton scattering rate in the klein - nishina regime , the scattering in the thomson regime dominates the inverse - compton energy losses for @xmath261 , and roughly as @xmath262 $ ] for @xmath263 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , one may conclude that even though the total energy density of the synchrotron photons in the jet rest frame is comparable to the comoving energy density of the magnetic field ( @xmath264 ) , the dominant radiative cooling for all the electrons is due to synchrotron emission , since @xmath265 for any @xmath0 .",
    "the timescale for synchrotron cooling may be evaluated as @xmath266 hence , @xmath267 equals the dynamical timescale of the emitting region , @xmath268 , for electron lorentz factor @xmath269 , i.e. , close to the second electron break energy @xmath170 .",
    "also the difference between the spectral indices below and above the break energy @xmath170 determined by our modeling , namely @xmath270 , is very close to the ` classical ' synchrotron cooling break @xmath189 expected for a uniform emission region , as discussed in ",
    "[ sscmodel ] .",
    "this agreement , which justifies at some level the assumed homogeneity of the emission zone , was in fact the additional constraint imposed on the model to break the degeneracy between the main free parameters .",
    "note that in such a case the first break in the electron energy distribution around electron energy @xmath196 is related to the nature of the underlying particle acceleration process .",
    "we come back to this issue in  [ eed ] ,    another interesting result from our model fit comes from the evaluation of the mean energy of the electrons responsible for the observed non - thermal emission of mrk501 . in particular , the mean electron lorentz factor is @xmath271 this value , which is determined predominantly by the minimum electron energy @xmath195 and by the position of the first break in the electron energy distribution , is comparable to the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath272 . in other words ,",
    "the mean energy of ultrarelativistic electrons within the blazar emission zone of mrk501 is comparable to the energy of non - relativistic / mildly - relativistic ( cold ) protons .",
    "this topic will be discussed further in  [ eed ] as well .",
    "the analysis presented allows us also to access the global energetics of the mrk501 jet .",
    "in particular , with the given energy densities @xmath273 and @xmath250 , we evaluate the total kinetic powers of the jet stored in ultrarelativistic electrons and magnetic field as @xmath274 and @xmath275 respectively . in the above expressions",
    ", we have assumed that the emission region analyzed occupies the whole cross - sectional area of the outflow , and that the jet propagates at sufficiently small viewing angle that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet equals the jet doppler factor emerging from our modeling , @xmath276 .",
    "these assumptions are justified in the framework of the one - zone homogeneous ssc scenario . moreover , assuming one electron - proton pair per electron - positron pair within the emission region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or equivalently @xmath277 where the total comoving number density of the jet leptons is @xmath278 we obtain the comoving energy density of the jet protons @xmath279 , and hence the proton kinetic flux @xmath280ergs@xmath7 .",
    "this is comparable to the kinetic power carried out by the leptons for mean proton lorentz factor @xmath281 ( see eq .  [ eq : le ] ) .",
    "it means that , within the dominant emission zone of mrk501 ( at least during non - flaring activity ) , ultrarelativistic electrons and mildly - relativistic protons , if comparable in number , are in approximate energy equipartition , and their energy dominates that of the jet magnetic field by two orders of magnitude .",
    "it is important to compare this result with the case of powerful blazars of the fsrq type , for which the relatively low mean energy of the radiating electrons , @xmath282 , assures dynamical domination of cold protons even for a smaller proton content @xmath283 ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "assuming @xmath284 for simplicity , we find that the implied total jet power @xmath285 constitutes only a small fraction of the eddington luminosity @xmath286 for the mrk501 black hole mass @xmath287 @xcite .",
    "in particular , our model implies @xmath288 in mrk501 . in this context , detailed investigation of the emission - line radiative output from the mrk501 nucleus by @xcite allowed for an estimate of the bolometric , accretion - related luminosity as @xmath289ergs@xmath7 , or @xmath290 .",
    "such a relatively low luminosity is not surprising for bl lacs , which are believed to accrete at low , sub - eddington rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for low - accretion - rate agn ( i.e.",
    ", those for which @xmath291 ) the expected radiative efficiency of the accretion disk is @xmath292 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the jet power estimated here for mrk501 is comfortably smaller than the available power of the accreting matter @xmath293 .",
    "finally , we note that the total emitted radiative power is @xmath294 where @xmath251 is given in equation [ eq : usync ] and the comoving energy density of @xmath0-ray photons , @xmath295 , was evaluated in an analogous way as @xmath296 .",
    "this implies that the jet / blazar radiative efficiency was at the level of a few percent ( @xmath297 ) during the period covered by the multifrequency campaign .",
    "such a relatively low radiative efficiency is a common characteristic of blazar jets in general , typically claimed to be at the level of @xmath298 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , the isotropic synchrotron and ssc luminosities of mrk501 corresponding to the observed average flux levels are @xmath299ergs@xmath7 and @xmath300ergs@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the results of the ssc modeling presented in the previous sections indicate that the energy spectrum of freshly accelerated electrons within the blazar emission zone of mrk501 is of the form @xmath301 between electron energy @xmath302gev and @xmath303gev , steepening to @xmath304 above @xmath10gev , such that the mean electron energy is @xmath305gev . at this point ,",
    "a natural question arises : is this electron distribution consistent with the particle spectrum expected for a diffusive shock acceleration process ?",
    "note in this context that the formation of a strong shock in the innermost parts of mrk501 might be expected around the location of the large bend ( change in the position angle by @xmath306 ) observed in the outflow within the first few parsecs ( projected ) from the core @xcite .",
    "this distance scale could possibly be reconciled with the expected distance of the blazar emission zone from the center for the model parameters discussed , @xmath307pc , for jet opening angle @xmath308 .    in order to address this question ,",
    "let us first discuss the minimum electron energy implied by the modeling , @xmath309gev . in principle , electrons with lower energies may be present within the emission zone , although their energy distribution has to be very flat ( possibly even inverted ) , in order not to overproduce the synchrotron radio photons and to account for the measured _",
    "fermi_-lat  @xmath0-ray continuum .",
    "therefore , the constrained minimum electron energy marks the injection threshold for the main acceleration mechanism , meaning that only electrons with energies larger than @xmath310 are picked up by this process to form the higher - energy ( broken ) power - law tail .",
    "interestingly , the energy dissipation mechanisms operating at the shock fronts do introduce a particular characteristic ( injection ) energy scale , below which the particles are not freely able to cross the shock front .",
    "this energy scale depends on the shock microphysics , in particular on the thickness of the shock front .",
    "the shock thickness , in turn , is determined by the operating inertial length , or the diffusive mean free path of the radiating particles , or both . such a scale depends critically on the constituents of the shocked plasma . for pure pair plasmas , only the electron thermal scale enters , and",
    "this sets @xmath311 .",
    "in contrast , if there are approximately equal numbers of electrons and protons , the shock thickness can be relatively large .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration can then operate on electrons only above a relatively high energy , establishing @xmath312 .",
    "here , @xmath313 represents some efficiency of the equilibration in the shock layer between shocked thermal protons and their electron counterparts , perhaps resulting from electrostatic potentials induced by charge separation of species of different masses @xcite .",
    "our multifrequency model fits suggest that @xmath314 , providing an important blazar shock diagnostic .    at even lower electron energies",
    ", other energization processes must play a dominant role ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in formation of very flat electron spectra ( see the related discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . which of these energy dissipation mechanisms are the most relevant , as well as how flat the particle spectra could be , are subjects of ongoing debates .",
    "different models and numerical simulations presented in the literature indicate a wide possible range for the lowest - energy particle spectral indices ( below @xmath310 ) , from @xmath315 down to @xmath316 , depending on the particular shock conditions and parameters @xcite .",
    "all in all , we argue that the relatively high minimum energy of the radiating electrons implied by the ssc modeling of the mrk501 broadband spectrum and the overall character of the electron energy evolution in this source are consistent with a proton - mediated shock scenario .",
    "in addition , the fact that the mean energy of the ultrarelativistic electrons is of the order of the proton rest energy , @xmath317 , can be reconciled with such a model . moreover",
    ", the constrained power - law slope of the electrons with energies @xmath318 , namely @xmath199 , seems to suggest a dominant role for diffusive shock acceleration above the injection energy @xmath310 , as this value of the spectral index is often claimed in the literature for particles undergoing first - order fermi acceleration at relativistic shock @xcite .",
    "the caveat here is that this result for the ` universal ' particle spectral index holds only for particular conditions ( namely , for ultrarelativistic shock velocities with highly turbulent conditions downstream of the shock : see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas in general a variety of particle spectra may result from the relativistic first - order fermi mechanism , depending on the local magnetic field and turbulence parameters at the shock front , and the speed of the upstream flow @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the evidence for ultrarelativistic electrons with spectral index @xmath199 in the jet of mrk501 may be considered as an indication that the plasma conditions within the blazar emission zone allow for efficient diffusive shock acceleration ( at least in this source ) , as described by the simplest asymptotic test - particle models , though only in a relatively narrow electron energy range .",
    "if the relativistic shock acceleration plays a dominant role in the blazar mrk 501 ( as argued above ) , the observations and the model results impose important constraints on this mechanism , many aspects of which are still not well understood .",
    "firstly , this process must be very efficient in the sense that all the electrons pre - accelerated / preheated to the energy @xmath309gev are picked up by the acceleration process so that a single electron component is formed above the injection threshold and there is no maxwellian - like population of particles around @xmath310 outnumbering the higher energy ones from the power - law tail ) can not be constrained by analyzing ` bulk - compton ' spectral features in the observed sed of mrk501 , in contrast to the situation in fsrqs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the second constraint is due to the presence of the spectral break @xmath319 around electron energies @xmath320gev . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", this break can not be simply a result of cooling or internal pair - attenuation effects , and hence must be accounted for by the acceleration mechanism .",
    "the discussion regarding the origin of this break  which may reflect variations in the global field orientation or turbulence levels sampled by particles of different energy  is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , the presence of high - energy breaks in the electron energy distribution ( intrinsic to the particle spectrum rather than forming due to cooling or absorption effects ) seems to be a common property of relativistic jet sources observed by _ fermi_-lat , such as the fsrq objects 3c454.3 and ao  0235 + 164 @xcite .      in ",

    "finally , the highest energy tail of the electron energy distribution , @xmath333 , responsible for the observed hard - x - ray synchrotron continuum ( @xmath60kev ) in the fast cooling regime , generates the bulk of @xmath0-rays with observed energies @xmath16tev ( blue line ) .",
    "interestingly , even though any sharp breaks in the underlying electron energy distribution are ` smeared out ' into a smoothly curved spectral continuum due to the nature of the synchrotron self - compton emission , the average data set does support the presence of distinct low - energy and high - energy segments in the electron spectrum .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to argue that the spectral variability of mrk501 observed by _",
    "fermi_-lat  may be explained by postulating that the low - energy segment of the electron energy distribution ( @xmath334 ) is characterized by only small flux variations , while the high - energy electron tail ( @xmath335 ) varies more substantially .",

    "tev fluxes from the inverse - compton bump .",
    "this expectation is not inconsistent with the fact that we do not see any obvious relation between the asm / bat fluxes and the lat ( @xmath336gev ) fluxes ( see figure[fig : lc30daysmw ] ) , because the electrons producing x - ray synchrotron photons above @xmath337kev contribute to the ssc emission mostly at the highest photon energies in the tev range ( see figure[fit2 ] ) .",
    "this issue will be studied in detail ( on timescales of 1 month down to 5 days ) in a forthcoming publication using the data from this multifrequency campaign .",
    "the x - ray / tev connection has been established in the past for many bl lacs ( and for mrk501 in particular ) .",
    "however , the exact character of the correlation between the x - ray and tev fluxes is known to vary from object to object , and from epoch to epoch in a given source , as widely discussed in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "note that the data analyzed in those papers were obtained mostly during periods of high activity .",
    "consequently , the conclusions presented were somewhat biased towards flaring activity , and hence they might not apply to the typical ( average ) behaviour of the source , which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "moreover , the data set from our campaign includes uv fluxes , soft - x - ray fluxes ( down to @xmath4kev ; swift ) , and @xmath0-ray fluxes spanning a very wide photon energy range ( @xmath36gev@xmath9tev ; _",
    "fermi_-lat  combined with magic and veritas ) .",
    "this unique data set allows us to evaluate the multifrequency variability and correlations for mrk501 over an unprecedented range of photon energies .    considering only the data set presented in this paper",
    ", we note that by steepening the high - energy electron continuum above the intrinsic break energy @xmath169 ( and only slightly adjusting the other model parameters ) , one can effectively remove photons above @xmath42gev in the ssc component , leaving a relatively steep spectrum below @xmath42gev , similar to the one observed by _",
    "fermi_-lat  during the time interval mjd 5486254892 ( see  [ fermispectrum ] ) .",
    "such a change should be accompanied by a decrease in the uv - to - soft - x - ray synchrotron fluxes by a factor of a few , but the data available during that time interval are not sufficient to detect this effect .",
    "this statement is further justified by the bottom panel in figure[fit2 ] , where the contributions of the different segments of electrons comptonizing the different segments of the synchrotron bump to the average @xmath0-ray emission of mrk501 are shown .",
    "note that the lowest - energy electron population ( @xmath334 ) inverse - compton upscattering only synchrotron photons emitted by the same population ( @xmath338hz ; solid red line ) may account for the bulk of the observed steep - spectrum @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "another important conclusion from this figure is that comptonization of the highest - energy synchrotron photons ( @xmath339hz ) by electrons with arbitrary energies produces only a negligible contribution to the average @xmath0-ray flux of mrk501 due to klein - nishina suppression .",
    "thus , the model presented here explains in a natural way the fact that the x - ray and tev fluxes of tev - emitting bl lacs are rarely correlated according to the simple scaling @xmath340 which would be expected from the class of ssc models in which the highest - energy electrons upscatter ( in the thomson regime ) their own synchrotron photons to the tev band ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , it opens a possibility for accommodating short - timescale variability ( @xmath341d ) at the highest synchrotron and inverse - compton frequencies ( hard x - rays and tev photon energies , respectively ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , in the model considered here , these high - energy tails of the two spectral components are produced by the highest - energy electrons which are deep in the strong cooling regime ( i.e. , for which @xmath342 ) , and thus the corresponding flux changes may occur on timescales shorter than @xmath343 ( see in this context , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , this outstanding ( and quite unexpected ) variation in the slope of the gev continuum did not correlate with the observed flux variations at energies above 0.3gev .",
    "we compared the @xmath0-ray activity measured by lat in two different energy ranges ( @xmath59gev and @xmath336gev ) with the x - ray activity recorded by the all - sky instruments _",
    "rxte_-asm ( @xmath62kev ) and _ swift_-bat ( @xmath58kev ) .",
    "we found no significant difference in the amplitude of the variability between x - rays and @xmath0-rays , and no clear relation between the x - ray and @xmath0-ray flux changes .",
    "we note , however , that the limited sensitivity of the asm and ( particularly ) the bat instruments to detect mrk501 in a 30-day time interval , together with the relatively stable x - ray emission of mrk501 during the observations , precludes any detailed x - ray/@xmath0-ray variability or correlation analysis .",
    "in this paper we also presented the first results from a 4.5-month multifrequency campaign on mrk501 , which lasted from 2009 march 15 ( mjd 54905 ) to 2009 august 1 ( mjd 55044 ) . during this period ,",
    "the source was systematically observed with different instruments covering an extremely broad segment of the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio frequencies up to tev photon energies . in this manuscript , we have focused on the average sed emerging from the campaign .",
    "further studies on the multifrequency variability and correlations will be covered in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we have modeled the average broadband spectrum of mrk501 ( from radio to tev ) in the framework of the standard one - zone synchrotron self - compton model , obtaining a satisfactory fit to the experimental data .",
    "we found that the dominant emission region in this source can be characterized by a size of @xmath376 , where @xmath377 cm is the gravitational radius of the black hole ( @xmath378 ) hosted by mrk501 .",
    "the intrinsic ( i.e. , not affected by cooling or absorption effects ) energy distribution of the radiating electrons required to fit the data was found to be of a broken power - law form in the energy range @xmath4gev@xmath9tev , with spectral indices 2.2 and 2.7 below and above the break energy of @xmath320gev , respectively .",
    "in addition , the model parameters imply that all the electrons cool predominantly via synchrotron emission , forming a cooling break at @xmath22tev .",
    "we argue that the particular form of the electron energy distribution emerging from our modeling is consistent with the scenario in which the bulk of the energy dissipation within the dominant emission zone of mrk501 is related to relativistic , proton - mediated shock waves . the low - energy segment of the electron energy distribution ( @xmath379 ) formed thereby , which dominates the production of @xmath0-rays observed below a few gev , seems to be characterized by low and relatively slow variability . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - energy electron tail ( @xmath380 ) , responsible for the bulk of the @xmath0-rays detected above a few gev , may be characterized by more significant variability .",
    "finally , we found that ultrarelativistic electrons and mildly - relativistic protons within the blazar zone of mrk501 , if comparable in number , are in approximate energy equipartition , with their energy dominating the energy in the jet magnetic field by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the model fit implies also that the total jet power , @xmath381ergs@xmath7 , constitutes only a small fraction of the eddington luminosity , @xmath288 , but is an order of magnitude larger than the bolometric , accretion - related luminosity of the central engine , @xmath382 .",
    "finally , we estimated the radiative efficiency of the mrk501 jet to be at the level of a few percent , @xmath383 , where @xmath384 is the total emitted power of the blazar . the results from this study could perhaps be extended to all hsp bl lacs .",
