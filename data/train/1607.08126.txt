    "most of the distinctive features of the equilibrium relaxation in disordered systems support the existence of microscopic cooperative motion  @xcite .",
    "examples are the spatially heterogeneous dynamics  @xcite ( where large regions of the system relax significantly faster , or slower , than the average ) , the non - gaussian distributions of displacements  @xcite ( resulting from averaging coupled and non - equally distributed individual displacements ) , or the non - debye decays of the time correlation functions  @xcite ( which again represent a manifestation of the system heterogeneous relaxation ) . with these empirical features we have composed a general _ dynamic _ catalog to characterize the slow relaxation of viscous liquids .",
    "nonetheless , the problem of whether or not this dynamic phenomenology relies on an underlying structure still remains open  @xcite .",

    "these systems have been categorized by the wide notions of _ glass _ and _ gel _ depending on their particular density and temperature behaviors as well as on their specific microscopic properties  @xcite .",
    "thus , we discriminate between strong and fragile glasses according to their viscosity temperature dependence ( arrhenius or super - arrhenius )  @xcite or between repulsive and attractive glasses  @xcite depending on the character of the microscopic interactions present in the system . often in a non - rigorous manner , we also distinguish glasses from gels according to macroscopic criteria such as viscoelasticity or solid - like behavior at low densities ( gels ) as well as microscopic criteria such as the existence of an amorphous network structure , which is typical of gelling systems  @xcite .",
    "apart from these available classifications , some of them phenomenological , microscopic canonical models can help us to not only develop novel applications but to better understand the microscopic mechanisms involved in the cooperative dynamics , and in its hypothetical structural origin , present in gels and glass forming liquids  @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work we study one of these models . by means of brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations , we investigate the equilibrium dynamic and static properties of a gelling system which develops an amorphous tetrahedral network upon decreasing temperature .",
    "in particular , we report a comprehensive study on the interplay between connectivity , dynamics , and structure which results in a qualitative microscopic picture for the viscoelastic nature of the low temperature liquid . + the system is constituted by tetravalent _ patchy particles _ , that is , particles with sticky spots on their surface which provide a strongly directional interaction with fixed valence  @xcite .",
    "far from being merely a theoretical or computational idealization , patchy particles are nowadays amenable to experimentation  @xcite .",

    "this and similar models  @xcite have already shown the capability for capturing some of the fundamental structural features of different classical systems with amorphous tetrahedral structure such as atomistic models of water , silicon , or silica  @xcite .",

    "we widely exploit this distribution of bonds to partition the system into particle populations .",
    "this discrimination allows us to establish a clear relation between connectivity and particle mobility .",

    "this dynamic length scale reaches distances of the order of few particles diameters .",
    "thanks to the study of the structure factor of the different particle populations , we are also able to demonstrate the existence of a second long - range length scale of _ static _ nature which is quantitatively similar to the previous dynamic length scale .",
    "this result suggests a clear connection between structure and dynamics at large spatial scales .",
    "we synthesize all these findings in a microscopic picture where the viscoelastic nature of the low temperature liquid would be the result of a viscous flow of cooperative domains of particles coupled to the network elasticity , which is in its turn mediated by the inter - domain connections .",

    "+ the large statistical deviation between theory and simulation data can be interpreted in terms of a spatial localization of the unbounded particles , where the presence of an unbounded patch in a given particle increases the probability of observing another unbounded patch in the same particle , a kind of correlation which is not contained in an independent bonding process . since the potential energy cost for breaking a bond is , to a great extent , independent on the bonding environment , this suggests a significant role of the entropic component in the bonding free energy .",
    "thus , for instance , if the weakly bounded particles localize themselves , the entropic gain when breaking a bond of one of these particles would be greater than the entropic gain when breaking a bond of a fully bounded particle .",
    "this entropic contribution enhances the population of the weakly bounded particles ( in particular of the monomers ) with respect to that expected for an independent bond - breaking process . in simple macroscopic terms , since both the binomial distribution of bonds given by equation ( 4 ) and that obtained from the simulation have the same potential energy , _",

    "however , and since both the binomial distribution and that obtained from the simulation have the same @xmath48 ( or @xmath42 ) value , the deviation in the population of monomers ( and , in general , in the weakly bounded particles ) must be balanced by the deviations in the populations of the almost fully bounded particles which ( according to our previous microscopic interpretation ) would be also more localized than what would be expected for an independent distribution of bonds .",

    "for instance , we have discussed the low-@xmath24 arrhenius evolution of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath53 . in this respect , we have introduced a novel methodology to discriminate the mean square displacement into different populations of particles according to their number of bonds at @xmath94 . by this methodology",
    "we have established a clear relation between number of bonds and particle mobility .",
    "thus , we have followed the partial mean square displacement of the different populations of particles for different temperatures and over a long time window where different regimes ( _ e.g. _ super and sub - diffusive ) have been documented for the different populations .",
    "+ we have carried out a similar analysis for the complete distribution of displacements by intensively exploring the van hove function of the system . at high and intermediate temperatures , the partial and total self van hove functions",
    "show the gaussian behavior expected for a high-@xmath24 liquid .",
    "however , at low @xmath24 we have found a noticeable non - gaussian behavior manifested through a long exponential tail which has been characterized for the different populations of particles at different time scales . in particular , our methodology has allowed us to report the intermittent dynamics of the weakly bounded particles at short times , which manifests itself by large displacements ( jumps ) at the single particle level . despite at low @xmath24 and long times the dynamics",
    "is already diffusive , the non - gaussian behavior of the self van hove function has permitted to document in a very clear way the _ anomalous yet brownian diffusion _ present in the system  @xcite . our study has been complemented with an alternative procedure , based on the non - gaussian parameter , to quantify the non - gaussian statistics .",
    "in addition , we have analyzed the collective dynamics of the system in real space by means of the distinct van hove function . in this respect ,",
    "we have shown the notorious rigidity of the low-@xmath24 liquid , which appears significant when compared with other strong and fragile glass forming - liquids  @xcite .",
    "+ we have also investigated the dynamics of the system in fourier space through the self and collective scattering functions . in this respect",

    "thus , the system retains its dynamic collective correlations at spatial scales even larger than that associated to the tetrahedral distance , despite the particles having individually moved even larger distances . at short @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath125 finally overpasses @xmath126 at a certain @xmath0 value which we have identified as a dynamic length scale which increases upon cooling the system .",
    "the dynamic length scale is linked to the size of dynamic domains of particles which evolve in a cooperative manner , and reaches a value of the order of few particle diameters at the lowest @xmath24 investigated .",
    "+ looking into the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath125 , we have shown how at high temperatures @xmath125 reproduces the behavior expected for a high-@xmath24 liquid , _ i.e. _ it shows a @xmath145 behavior within the explored @xmath0 range . however , at low @xmath24 we have documented the emergence of a @xmath0-independent behavior at intermediate @xmath0 and a @xmath139-dependence at short @xmath0 ( @xmath159 ) . in particular , the @xmath139-dependence of @xmath125 appears as an interesting feature of the low @xmath24 dynamics of the system which so far had only been detected in out - of - equilibrium gelling systems as a consequence of their aging dynamics  @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we have investigated the emergence of long - range static correlations compatible with the detected dynamic length scale .",
    "we again took advantage of our methodology to separate the low @xmath24 structure factor of the system into partial structure factors according to the particle number of bonds . in order to reveal the cooperative - domain picture suggested by our dynamic results",
    ", we have studied the structure factor of those populations of particles with @xmath60 and @xmath189 bonds to reveal the _",

    "indeed , at low @xmath24 we have found that a structure is present at small @xmath0 , where the partial structure factors show a monotonically increasing behavior as @xmath183 .",
    "interestingly , the values at which the small-@xmath0 structure emerges are very similar to those reported for the long range dynamic length scale ( @xmath180 ) , suggesting a plausible connection between structure and dynamics which extends to large spatial scales . + in summary , we have documented the rich dynamic and structural phenomenology present in a tetrahedral network liquid of tetravalent patchy particles .",
    "the resulting microscopic scenario has been interpreted in terms of a dynamic - static domain picture which accounts for the viscoelastic nature of the low @xmath24 liquid .",
    "this picture relies on the basis of a viscous flow of cooperative domains of particles where the network elasticity is mediated by the inter - domain connections . to reach our description of the low-@xmath24 liquid we have supported our investigation with a new methodology consisting on the discrimination of the system connectivity in terms of particle populations , where each population corresponds to all the particles with a given number of bonds .",
