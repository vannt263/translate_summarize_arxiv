    "dirac [ 1 ] , in 1927 , postulated the existence of an hermitian phase operator , @xmath0 , as part of a polar decomposition of the annihilation operator , @xmath1 , for a single quantum harmonic oscillator , where @xmath2 is the photon number operator , the eigenvalues of which correspond to the energy levels of the oscillator . in this ordering the operator",
    "@xmath3 lowers the photon number ( like @xmath4 but without any @xmath5 factor ) @xmath6 however , the action on the vacuum state is undefined . in 1964 ,",
    "susskind and glogower [ 2 ] demonstrated that no such hermitian operator exists on the denumerably infinite dimensional space [ 3 ] spanned by the number - kets @xmath7 .",
    "they proposed , instead , the use of a polar decomposition of @xmath4 with the opposite ordering ; the susskind - glogower ( sg ) phase operator , @xmath8 , so that the sg operator is a pure lowering operator which stops ( i.e. , yields the null ket ) at the vacuum : @xmath9 where to simplify the notation we let @xmath10 . thus the sg operator has a number representation given by : @xmath11 . due to the bound on photon number eigenspectra ( i.e. , the absence of negative energy eigenstates ) this translation however can not be unitary",
    ". it can only be one - sided unitary , i.e. , @xmath12 but @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the identity operator on the state space of a single harmonic oscillator and @xmath15 is the vacuum projector .",
    "thus , pure translation on a bounded state space can not be unitary ; therefore it can not be expressed as the power series of an hermitian ( i.e. , self - adjoint ) operator . in light of an ever improving understanding of what it means to associate a measurement with an operator which does nt commute with its adjoint",
    ", we [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] demonstrated a connection between the sg operator and helstrom s maximum likelihood ( ml ) quantum phase estimator [ 6 ] .",
    "helstrom was not concerned with polar decompositions of the annihilation operator , nor with obtaining a description of a phase measurement that is complementary to that of photon counting .",
    "the ml measurement is based on the state - dependent kets : @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the phases of the number - ket expansion coefficients , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the ml phase estimation procedure can be decomposed into two steps : the first being to effectively remove the phases of the input quantum state s number - ket expansion coefficients , @xmath19 , i.e. , these phases are all effectively set to be equal to zero .",
    "this first step can only be omitted if the @xmath19 are already real .",
    "the second step turns out to be equivalent to performing a relative phase measurement between two oscillators ( complementary to the measurement of the difference in their photon numbers ) when one of those oscillators is in the vacuum state [ 7 ] , [ 8 ]  resulting in the single oscillator ( or single - mode ) phase statistics , which are @xmath20 in a sense that we will elucidate herein .",
    "thus the ml statistics correspond to the single - mode statistics for the case of states with real @xmath19 , as depicted in the venn diagram of fig .  1 .",
    "concurrently ( with respect to [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ) and independently , an alternate method for obtaining the single oscillator statistics was derived by pegg and barnett [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .",
    "their approach requires the truncation of the infinite - dimensional state space of a harmonic oscillator to one of finite but arbitrarily large dimension .",
    "this subspace , denoted @xmath21 , is spanned by the number - kets @xmath22 . when @xmath23 is finite the resulting pegg - barnett ( pb ) discrete - phase kets are an orthogonal subset of the single - mode continuous phase - kets , as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "this approach is described in appendix 1 but it is important to note in passing that : _ when s is finite _ the discrete - phase measurement is `` sharp '' ( i.e. , it permits wavefunction collapse via projections onto the eigenkets of an hermitian operator ) .",
    "yet we also have that : _ when instead _ the limit @xmath24 is taken , these discrete - phase statistics converge ( in distribution , i.e. , in as much as rational numbers can converge to real numbers ) to those of a fundamentally `` fuzzy '' measurement  the single - mode continuous phase statistics ( i.e. , the continuous envelope to which they converge can not collapse to a delta - function ) .",
    "thus , unless @xmath23 is left to be finite , this is an alternate means of calculating the same statistics via a limiting procedure .",
    "the connection to the sg operator is as follows .",
    "although the sg operator has other eigenkets ( the coherent phase states [ 11 ] ) we restrict our attention to the infinite energy subset of these  the continuous phase - kets , of number representation : @xmath25 which are normailzable in the continuous @xmath26 domain [ 12 ] . the restriction to these",
    "was made not only to connect with the essence of ml phase estimation ; but ( more significantly ) to obtain complementarity to the measurement of photon number .",
    "these kets have been said [ 13 ] to be of fundamental importance because they underlie ml phase estimation .",
    "it was also noted [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] however that these phase - kets are of even greater significance because they provide the first of three layers of understanding complementarity in a more general context .",
    "complementarity at the first layer corresponds to the fuzzy single - mode case ( depicted in fig .",
    "1 , which generalizes the ml measurement and to which the pb measurement can converge ) .",
    "the second and third layers of understanding can only be achieved when we extend beyond the fuzzy measurement by working in a state space larger than that of a single oscillator  as we will in the next section .",
    "the sg operator does not commute with its adjoint , hence it is not comprised of a set of commuting hermitian operators .",
    "therefore the measurement statistics we associate with it can not be calculated via the familiar hermitian operator rules ( e.g. , moments calculated via @xmath27 for @xmath28 do _ not _ correspond to the single - mode statistics ) .",
    "quantum measurements can be described in terms of wavefunctions ( as well as operators ) and perhaps the simplest path to the single - mode statistics is to form the phase wavefunction @xmath29 from which the phase probability distribution @xmath30 , and its associated moments follow directly .",
    "this will be formally justified below but it stems from the fact that the ( non - orthogonal ) phase - kets are complete : @xmath31    the resolution of the identity by the phase - kets in ( 6 ) permits the extremely useful phase representation of an arbitrary quantum state : @xmath32 analogous to the familiar number - ket expansion of a state : @xmath33 just as the number - ket expansion coefficients , @xmath18 , may be viewed as a wavefunction in discrete n - space , the inner product @xmath34 is a wavefunction in continuous @xmath26space .",
    "the fourier transform between the number and phase wavefunctions : @xmath35 demonstrates the complementarity of photon number and quantum phase .",
    "thus , to reveal the phase properties of an arbitrary state , we can simply take the familiar number - ket expansion coefficients , @xmath19 , to be the fourier series coefficients for @xmath36  which underlies the harmonic oscillator s continuous and periodic phase distribution .",
    "several relations among @xmath19 and @xmath36 are reminiscent of those encountered in schrodinger s wave mechanics .",
    "analogous to the position representation of the momentum operator @xmath37 , for example , we have a phase representation of the number operator , @xmath38 :    @xmath39    we note in passing , however , that differentiation with respect to a discrete variable is an undefined operation .",
    "alternatively we might have arrived at this , ( 4 )  ( 10 ) , without any reference to the sg operator , via a general theory of complementarity ( as is done in appendix 2 , and as is @xmath40 for the fuzzy description of the angle of a particle of finite angular momentum , since then there is also an upper bound on the complementary eigenspectra and that prohibits a lowering operator from having any eigenkets at all ) .",
    "historically such an obvious approach ( resulting in a fourier transform between complementary wavefunctions ) has been slow to gain acceptance  leading to a lack of time and angle operators in quantum theory  due to the mathematical subtleties which arise from our perfectly valid predelection for hermitian operators ( and/or equivalently for wavefunctions that can collapse ) .",
    "one might argue that these can now be accepted as `` fuzzy '' measurements , i.e. , non - projection valued poms ( probability operator measures ) [ 14 ] so that , at layer 1 , this @xmath41 a solution since these measurements do exist .",
    "the author however views fuzzy measurements as `` incomplete descriptions '' [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] of a realizable measurement ; and would argue that one still needs to achieve a ( sharp ) `` complete description '' of such measurements in terms of sets of commuting hermitian operators and their associated collapsible wavefunctions to fully understand the complementarity alluded to at this first layer .",
    "a non - projection valued pom is simply a resolution of the identity operator by non - orthogonal eigenkets [ 14 ] .",
    "the bound in their complementary eigenspectra prevents orthogonality for the single - mode phase - kets of ( 4 ) .",
    "equivalently , ( 9 ) describes a one - sided fourier series , but it would take a two - sided fourier series to represent a delta - function .",
    "the limited dimensionality of the space in one domain can not support such sharp behavior in the complementary wavefunction .",
    "this limitation does more than prohibit delta - functions , it restricts the class of single - mode phase statistics to those which must satisfy a paley - weiner theorem [ 15 ] which can be expressed as @xmath42 this theorem demonstrates , for example , that @xmath43 can not vanish over an interval of non - zero width .",
    "the limited dimensionality of the underlying wavefunctions simply can not support such sharp behavior .",
    "thus the single - mode phase distribution , @xmath44 , can vanish ( equal zero ) only at isolated points in @xmath26 .",
    "the fact that non - projection valued poms do correspond to realizable quantum measurements can be made more palatable via naimark s extension theorem [ 14 ] which ( to paraphrase ) states that these correspond to the measurement of sets of commuting hermitian operators defined on a larger state space when subsets of that larger space are not entangled with the state of the original space prior to the measurement . in this section",
    "we describe two examples from quantum optics in which the original space @xmath45 is that of a single - mode ( i.e. , a single harmonic oscillator  the original system of interest ) ; the larger space is the product space @xmath46 of the original mode with some additional ( a.k.a .  auxiliary ) mode on @xmath47 which fundamentally @xmath48 be a part of the physical apparatus which realizes the quantum measurement ; and the additional mode is `` off '' ( i.e. , placed in the vacuum state ) prior to the measurement .",
    "it is important to note from the onset however that naimark s extension theorem provides a means of describing a measurement which is @xmath49 fuzzy in the aforementioned senses .",
    "it does not provide a general means of extending to a sharp measurement ( as we will in the next section ) although it can sometimes give clues as to how that might proceed .",
    "clearly the operator @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the commuting ( hence simultaneously measureable ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 position operators , is measureable in the sharp sense ( since it commutes with its adjoint [ 16 ] ) . for an operator such as @xmath55 however , where @xmath56 is the x - component of the momentum operator , we certainly can not directly associate a sharp measurement since a perfectly precise simultaneous measurement of its real and imaginary components would constitute a violation of the uncertainty principle ( i.e. , @xmath4 does not commute with its adjoint ) .",
    "we can however associate a quantum measurement with such an operator in a fuzzy sense : a simultaneous measurement of its real and imaginary components which is not perfectly precise in either .",
    "that such a measurement exists stems from the fact that the eigenkets of this annihilation operator ( the coherent states @xmath57 [ 17 ] ) are complete , i.e. , they resolve the identity operator ; and completeness alone is sufficient to guarantee that @xmath58 is a perfectly valid pdf ( probability distribution function ) which must therefore , in some sense , describe a realizable quantum measurement .",
    "the fact that the coherent states are not orthogonal is a reflection of the fact that this is a fuzzy measurement .",
    "fundamental to the realizable measurement of any operator which does not commute with its adjoint is the existence of an auxiliary noise source .",
    "zero - point fluctuations [ 18 ] from this auxiliary mode prevent a perfectly precise simultaneous measurement of the non - commuting real and imaginary parts of the original operator ( so that the uncertainty principle is not violated ) .",
    "we can see this more clearly by extending the operator of interest to a larger space .",
    "any quantum measurement described by a non - projection valued pom on @xmath59 can be represented by a collection of commuting observables on a larger hilbert space .",
    "the utility of this representation lies in the identification of the aforementioned noise source .",
    "this auxiliary system is an integral part of the physical apparatus which realizes the quantum measurement .",
    "formally , the procedure is to find the naimark extension , on @xmath60 , of the desired pom on @xmath59 . for our purpose",
    ", this amounts to finding an operator on @xmath61 , say @xmath62 , which commutes with its adjoint such that its real and imaginary parts form a pair of commuting observables ( a.k.a .",
    "hermitian operators ) .",
    "furthermore , we require that the measurement statistics of @xmath62 reproduce those of the original operator on @xmath59 ( associated with the desired pom ) when the auxiliary system is in some appropriate quantum state .",
    "we consider now a product space description of the measurement associated with the annihilation operator @xmath63 , for a single quantum harmonic oscillator , defined on the space @xmath59 .",
    "when this oscillator is used to model a single mode of the electromagnetic field , this measurement can be realized by the heterodyne detection process and the non - commuting real and imaginary parts of @xmath63 , denoted @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , represent the in - phase and quadrature field components .",
    "it has been shown [ 19 ] that one extension of @xmath63 onto @xmath60 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the annihilation operator for the auxiliary mode .",
    "since operators on different spaces commute , we have @xmath68 = 0 $ ] so that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath52 , denoted as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , comprise a pair of commuting observables .",
    "notice that when the auxiliary mode is in the vacuum state the expected values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in this realizable measurement of @xmath63 , are the same as those of two @xmath73 measurements of the non - commuting operators , @xmath64 and @xmath65 on two identically prepared systems : @xmath74 and @xmath75 where we used @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for the second moments",
    "however , we find @xmath78 and @xmath79 the variance of a measurement of @xmath64 on the original system ( of state space @xmath59 ) is @xmath80 .",
    "the variance of a @xmath81 or independent measurement of @xmath82 , on an identically prepared system , is @xmath83",
    ". therefore the variances of the outcomes @xmath84 and/or @xmath85 , for the simultaneous measurement of @xmath69 and @xmath70 on @xmath61 , are larger than @xmath86 and/or @xmath87 by 1/4 .",
    "the additive terms of 1/4 arise from the zero - point fluctuations of the auxiliary system .",
    "similar terms appeared in the arthurs and kelly derivation of an uncertainty principle for the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum [ 20 ] .        in the measurement apparatus of heterodyne detection ,",
    "the auxiliary noise source is the `` image '' electromagnetic mode ( characterized by annihilation operator @xmath88 ) which resides at the same frequency displacement from the classical local oscillator ( lo ) frequency as does the original mode of interest ( characterized by annihilation operator @xmath63 ) as in fig .  2 .",
    "even a classical treatment of heterodyning reveals that the beat of the image band with the local oscillator is mapped onto the same detector frequency as the beat of the local oscillator with the original signal .",
    "quantum mechanically , however , we note that we can not turn the image mode off in the sense that when it is in the vacuum state we have zero - point fluctuations which contribute noise to the detected signal .",
    "this noise ( essential for preventing the unrealizable perfectly precise measurement of @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) is seen to be irrevocably imbedded in the measurement apparatus of the heterodyne detection process .",
    "extensions of this type are not unique and naimark s theorem is only meant to recover the fuzzy statistics ( not go beyond them ) .",
    "algebraically , we see that for any operator @xmath89 whose commutator with it s adjoint is @xmath90 $ ] one such extension is @xmath91 ; provided that @xmath92 ( as it does for @xmath4 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "let @xmath94 be the sg operator for the original system of interest ; an extension of this form onto @xmath60 is @xmath95 we can also see explicitly , from the number representations of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and recalling the definition of the vacuum projector , @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 so that @xmath100 = [ \\widehat{a}_s , { { \\widehat{a}_s}^\\dagger } ] \\otimes \\widehat{v}_a + \\widehat{v}_s \\otimes [ { \\widehat{a}_a^\\dagger } , \\widehat{a}_a ] = 0.\\ ] ]    next , by solving for the eigenkets of @xmath101 , we obtain the @xmath101 measurement statistics for an arbitrary state , @xmath102 , on @xmath61 . setting @xmath103 yeilds",
    "@xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "the eigenvalue , @xmath106 , could also be zero , in which case the corresponding eigenket can be any superposition of `` off - axis '' number states , i.e. , those which do not involve @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "when the auxiliary mode is in the vacuum state , @xmath109 , the general result reduces to the following : the outcome of the @xmath101 measurement is a complex number of unit magnitude , @xmath105 , and the probability distribution for its phase is @xmath110  identical to that from the pom description of the measurement associated with @xmath96 .",
    "the single complex - valued outcome , @xmath105 , of the @xmath101 measurement may also be viewed as a pair of real - valued results , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 . the fact that @xmath101 commutes with its adjoint implies that its real and imaginary parts , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , are commuting observables .",
    "these can also be written in the form @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath96 ) .",
    "the expected values of these , from a single @xmath101 measurement with the auxiliary mode in the vacuum state , are identical to those of the two distinct measurements of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 and similarly @xmath121 for the second moments , first note that @xmath122 and @xmath123 furthermore , since @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the second moments of @xmath126 and @xmath127 in a @xmath101 measurement with the auxiliary mode in the vacuum state are @xmath128 and @xmath129    to interpret the real and imaginary components let us return momentarily to the original notation of the sg operator @xmath130 .",

    "the physical apparatus which realizes the @xmath101 measurement has not yet been identified .",
    "the presence of the auxiliary mode , however , @xmath140 ( on physical grounds ) be an inextricable part of this apparatus  as it is in heterodyne detection .",
    "in this section we provide an example of how one can extend the sg operator onto a subset of the two - mode space in order to describe a sharp quantum phase measurement which yields the next layer of understanding complementarity ( be it for phase , time or an angle ) .",
    "there are an infinite number of such subsets that can be defined on a two - mode space , but a general theory ( and final layer of understanding ) on an unrestricted two - mode space will be discussed in section iv .",
    "historically , @xmath101 was derived on physical ( rather than algebraic ) grounds to achieve a sharp measurement , rather than just recover the fuzzy statistics [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] as follows . clearly the problems in formulating a time or angle operator stem from the bounded eigenspectra of the complementary quantity ( energy or angular momentum ) .",
    "e.g. , for a phase operator it s the absence of negative energy states for the quantum harmonic oscillator which leads to the sg operator not commuting with its adjoint .",
    "the sg operator can not lower below the vacuum ( 2 ) since there are no `` negative - number '' ( negative energy ) states for the oscillator .",
    "the extension , @xmath101 , however : lowers the original system mode photon number @xmath141 then _ continues _ through the vacuum @xmath142 and raises the auxiliary mode photon number @xmath143    topologically , it is as if @xmath101 continues to lower below the vacuum into the auxiliary ( negative - number ) mode .",
    "the visualization of this behavioral aspect can be facilitated by simply relabeling the number states according to the value of @xmath144 .",
    "one might anticipate that these translations in energy difference will lead to complementarity between @xmath145 and the `` relative phase '' between the two oscillators .",
    "indeed , let us relabel the @xmath101 eigenkets as @xmath146 these reside on a subset , @xmath147 , of @xmath46 which is spanned by @xmath148 .",
    "when the auxiliary mode is in the vacuum state ( @xmath149 ) , the @xmath101 measurement yields the single - mode statistics and their attendant paley - wiener restriction",
    ".    we can go _ beyond _ these fuzzy statistics by exciting the auxiliary mode to create an arbitrary state on @xmath147 : @xmath150 let @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the generalized phase wavefunction , @xmath153 is a two - sided fourier series . the paley - wiener restriction is removed and the @xmath154 can now `` collapse '' to a delta - function .",
    "commensurate with its negative - number behavioral aspect , the auxiliary mode can be interpreted as a phase - reversed mode in the following sense .",
    "consider the case of when the auxiliary mode is in the vacuum state @xmath155 and denote an initial state by @xmath156 .",
    "the state ( in the schrodinger picture ) after time evolution of an amount @xmath157 is @xmath158 so that the relation between the generalized phase representations of the initial and delayed states is simply @xmath159 now consider the case of the original system being in the vacuum state @xmath160 .",
    "the schrodinger picture of the delayed version of an initial state @xmath156 is @xmath161 the initial and delayed generalized phase representations for this case are related by @xmath162 thus the two modes are phase - reversed in that , under time evolution , the @xmath163 portion of the generalized phase wavefunction moves backwards with respect to the @xmath164 portion .",
    "of course there is nothing mysterious about the fact that the energy difference , @xmath145 , can be negative . nor does the phase reversed aspect of the auxiliary mode imply a violation of temporal causality since @xmath26 ( which is complementary to @xmath145 ) turns out to be the relative phase between the two modes , as we now demonstrate ; which will also start to define what we mean by `` relative phase '' which of course implies a quantum measurement . in so doing we shall also set the stage for the general two - mode relative phase representation ( which does not require restriction of the state to @xmath147 ) .",
    "generalizing complementarity to be viewed as fourier relations among wavefunctions , we anticipate that what might be of use here is to start with the two dimensional fourier transform of the @xmath165 .",
    "indeed , @xmath166 provides this : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is now an arbitrary state on @xmath46 with number - ket expansion coefficients @xmath169 and @xmath170 is the probability density function for the simultaneous measurement of @xmath171 and @xmath172 .    under the change of variables @xmath173 we map to a different wavefunction @xmath174 where @xmath175 ; so that @xmath176 and @xmath177 in the above .",
    "notice that by making the change of variables in the wavefunction ( rather than in the pdf ) we have also changed the quantum measurement . if instead we made a similar change of variables in the pdf it would correspond to measuring both @xmath171 and @xmath172 first and then adding and/or subtracting the results ; but that is not what @xmath178 and @xmath179 represent in ( 43 ) . since @xmath180 is bounded from below , the sum phase , @xmath181 , is not measureable in the sharp sense . in section",
    "iv two reasonable ways of dealing with @xmath181 and hence defining a direct measurement of the relative phase @xmath182 on @xmath183 are presented . for states restricted to @xmath147",
    ", one of these ways can be obtained from ( 43 ) and we find @xmath184 which demonstrates that the argument in @xmath154 is a relative phase as asserted .",
    "we can define a relative phase measurement between any two modes we wish . if however we choose two modes which are already time or phase reversed in some physical sense ( e.g. , an electromagnetic mode of wavevector @xmath185 and another of wavevector @xmath186 ) then the formalism can lead to more physical insight .",
    "for example , if the two modes are the right and left circular polarizations of an electromagnetic plane wave then the relative phase measurement is equal to ( not just isomorphic to ) the quantum angle measurement .",
    "as clarified in the next section , for such photons our definitions of @xmath180 and @xmath145 and the change of variables in ( 42 ) are appropriate . if instead of such photons our harmonic oscillators ( modeling angular momenta ) are schwinger s [ 21 ] fermionic primitives then the factors of one - half should go elsewhere ( we would divide @xmath180 and @xmath145 by two in the above definitions and multiply by two in ( 42 ) for the appropriate change of variables ) .",
    "in 1952 schwinger [ 21 ] demonstrated a connection between the algebra of two uncoupled harmonic oscillators and the algebra of angular momenta . in quantum optics",
    "this connection has proved useful in the analysis of optical beam splitters [ 22 ] although a beam splitter does not actually perform a rotation in physical space and the connection is merely within the mathematics .",
    "this connection has also proved useful in calculating the effects of actual rotations on systems but the oscillators ( which behave like spin-1/2 bosons ) are deemed unphysical [ 23 ] .",
    "we put more physics into this connection by considering rotations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this leads to a subtle but surprisingly significant modification of schwinger s model .",
    "also , by describing the oscillator states in the phase representation we will be led to insights on the angles themselves ( rather than their conjugate momenta ) .",
    "we begin with a brief summary of the key points of schwinger s model .",
    "let @xmath187 and @xmath188 denote the annihilation operators for two harmonic oscillators which are uncoupled ( i.e. , independent ) so that @xmath189 = 0= [ \\hat{a}_{u } , \\hat{a}_{d}].\\ ] ] defining @xmath190 it is easy to show that @xmath191 = 2{\\hbar } \\hat{j}_{z } \\ \\ \\text{and } \\ \\ [ \\hat{j}_{+ } , \\hat{j}_{- } ] = \\pm \\hbar \\hat{j}_{\\pm},\\ ] ] which are the fundamental communication relations of angular momentum . the raising and lowering operators , @xmath192 ,",
    "can of course be alternatively expressed in terms of the x and y component angular momentum operators as @xmath193    since , from ( 43 ) , @xmath192 raise and lower the eigenvalue of @xmath194 ( i.e. , @xmath145 ) by one , it is as though we have one spin-1/2 particle , with spin up ( or down ) associated with each quanta of the u ( or d ) oscillators .",
    "the z component of angular momentum is then simply @xmath195 times the difference in the number of up and down quanta , commensurate with ( 43 ) .",
    "therefore , in terms of eigenvalues we have @xmath196 from which we anticipate @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the eigenvalue of @xmath199 . indeed , @xmath200 so that @xmath201 as expected .    in schwinger s scheme however , a total of two up and down quanta will always yield @xmath202 , i.e. , the anti - symmetric singlet state ( of @xmath203 ) would never occur . as sakurai",
    "[ 23 ] puts it : `` only totally symmetrical states are constructed by this method .",
    "the primitive spin 1/2 particles appearing here are actually _ bosons _ !",
    "this method is quite adequate if our purpose is to examine the properties under rotations of states characterized by @xmath180 and @xmath145 without asking how such states are built up initially . ''",

    "for example , one x - polarized photon , @xmath269 two x - polarized photons , should have a polarization ellipse along the x - axis with `` up along x '' and `` down along x '' being equally most likely ; and the identical snapshot distribution at any time must follow suit .",
    "indeed this physically reasonable result holds in the quantum angle representation .",
    "however , if we have a superposition of one x - polarized photon @xmath270 two x - polarized photons then the value of @xmath180 is not unique and the snapshot distributions are not identical to the polarization ellipse .",

    "if we add amplitudes instead , then although both @xmath180-components have an amplitude for being `` down along x '' at this time ( when @xmath277 ) those amplitudes are out of phase at this time so they cancel and the snapshot distribution ( when @xmath277 ) is only `` up along x '' ( i.e. , peaks only at @xmath267 ) as shown in fig .  4 , where the x - axis is absolute time ( @xmath178 from 0 to @xmath278 ) ; the y - axis is the angle ( @xmath26 from @xmath279 to @xmath278 ) ; and the contours indicate the @xmath280 probability density ( from @xmath281 to @xmath282 ) .",

    "consider now how `` up along x '' can evolve into `` down along x. '' classically , the two ( right and left handed ) circular polarization vectors counter - rotate in time and their sum creates a linearly polarized vector that shrinks to zero half - way between the time it is `` up along x '' and the time it is `` down along x. '' quantum mechanically , the renormalized snapshot pdfs can not vanish ( although without renormalization these can shrink towards zero , reflecting an unlikelihood of taking a snapshot at that time ) .",
    "moreover , these pdfs are paley - weiner restricted in shape ( for finite @xmath180 ) so delta - functions are not allowed and the pdfs can not equal zero over angular intervals of non - zero length .",

    "however , the probability of taking a snapshot at time @xmath295 is over three orders of magnitude smaller than the probability of taking a snapshot at time @xmath296 .",
    "thus , when we take the time average inherent in forming the polarization ellipse the influence of the @xmath295 snapshot is greatly diminished .",
    "the renormalization constant @xmath256 is the probability of the conditioning event , i.e. , the constant is itself also a pdf  the pdf for the measurement of absolute phase which ( like absolute time ) is measureable in the fuzzy , albeit not in the sharp , sense . in considering a sequence of snapshot pdfs for various @xmath178 we should dispense with the notion of absolute time marching along uniformly ( as it has historically , as a parameter in quantum theory rather than an operator ) . instead when we realize that the probability of the conditioning event is telling us that taking a snapshot at one time is not as probable as at some other time  then we see more clearly how these snapshots turn into the quantum polarization ellipse .",
    "it is as if the polarization vectors spend more time in snapshots where @xmath297 is large and zip past ( or even skip ) snapshots taken at @xmath178 of small ( or even zero ) @xmath297 .",
    "the time averaging inherent in the marginal pom , naturally incorporates this weighting .",
    "the quantum polarization ellipses for an x - polarized coherent state of @xmath298 and @xmath299 are presented on a db scale in the polar plots of figure 9 .",
    "to better reveal the side - lobe structure it is preferable to plot the log of probability ( rather than the probability itself ) and to avoid a negative radius in a polar plot we add a scaling constant . in the graphics",
    "we arbitrarily scale each of these so that the peak of each of the pdfs corresponds to 60 db ( setting the peaks to some fixed reference level facilitates comparison of the underlying shapes ) .",
    "we see , for @xmath288 , the probability of being `` up along the y - axis '' is almost 40 db below the probability of being `` up along the x - axis . '' for @xmath300",
    "we see this ratio is over 20 db and for @xmath284 we are approaching the @xmath301 case of a uniform distribution ( a circular polarization ellipse ) since the vacuum state is rotationally invariant .     and @xmath299 .",
    "]    of course an x - polarized coherent state is not exactly orthogonal to a y - polarized coherent state since they share the same vacuum state . but",
    "an x - polarized number state can also have an appreciable @xmath294 although these are exactly orthogonal to any y - polarized number state ( when that number is not zero ) .",
    "more generally , within the phase representation one can readily see that only terms of the form cos@xmath302 will arise for states of @xmath303 that are symmetric under @xmath304 [ 29  31 ] .",
    "any state for which the y - polarization mode is in the vacuum state will have this symmetry .",
    "for photons , @xmath145 will be odd when @xmath180 is odd ( @xmath145 increments by two for photons , see figure 3 ) and in that case the probability of @xmath305 vanishes ( for all @xmath178 ) .",
    "thus , a single x - polarized photon will never have an electric field pointing along the y - axis ( i.e. , @xmath306 when its quantum angle is measured , but a two - photon x - polarized field can !",
    "indeed , any x - polarized field with non - vanishing components of even @xmath180 ( such as a coherent state ) will exhibit such behavior . in the classical limit @xmath294 rapidly diminishes ( even for @xmath307 only equal to @xmath299 its already less than @xmath308 ) but for a weak coherent state of @xmath284 it is slightly over @xmath309 .",
    "since weak coherent states are sometimes used in polarization based quantum communication systems to mimic single - photon states , such an effect might merit consideration [ 32 ] .",
    "the complementarity between time and energy , as well as between an angle and a component of angular momentum , was described at three layers of understanding complementarity in a more general context . the first layer , comprised of a simple fourier transform of the complementary wavefunction , amounts to a non - projection - valued probability - operator measure and we elucidated ways in which these can be interpreted as fuzzy measurements .",
    "the phase of a single harmonic oscillator and the angle of a single particle are examples in which the limited dimensionality of the state space was shown to prevent wavefunction collapse in the phase or angle wavefunctions and further restrict the class of their realizable fuzzy measurement statistics .",
    "such measurements can however be described via sets of commuting observables on a larger state space which includes an auxiliary system ( which _ must _ be a part of the apparatus which realizes the measurement ) when the auxiliary and original systems are not entangled prior to the measurement .    therein the auxiliary system is shown to function as a noise source and the fuzzy statistics manifest .",
    "such extensions to larger state spaces are not unique and are only intended to recover the fuzzy statistics .",
    "to go beyond these we must also extend the _ meaning _ of what it is that we wish to measure . clearly no general way of doing that can exist but using complementarity as a guide we were led to the conclusion that formally : only relative phase can be measured and the angle of a particle will require a field for its measurement .",
    "the meaning of relative phase gleaned at the second layer of understanding was achieved on an important subspace of the more general two - mode ( two oscillator ) state space .",
    "this subspace has some interesting physical properties ( automatically entangling the two modes ) which are also useful for quantum noise reduction and it is the space in which the celebrated n00n states reside .",
    "the phenomena of super - resolution is readily apparent in the quantum phase representation which also reveals that entanglement is not required and the n00n state performance can be identically reproduced on the single - mode space : simply notice that the periodicity of the magnitude square of a fourier series is set by the minimal distance in @xmath145 between non - vanishing fourier coefficients .    in preparation for the final layer of understanding complementarity , schwinger s harmonic oscillator model of angular momentum",
    "was modified to include the case of photons ( instead of only the unrealizable fermionic primitives ) . therein the quantum angle measurement ( complementary to the measurement of a component of angular momentum )",
    "was shown to be equivalent to the relative phase measurement between those two oscillators .",
    "the meaning of relative phase was finalized at the third layer . at the second layer",
    "there are an infinite number of subspaces that could be defined on a two - mode space wherein each value of photon number difference also corresponds to a unique value of number sum .",
    "the general theory ( and final layer of understanding ) on an unrestricted two - mode space can cover all of those infinite number of possible measurements and it demonstrates two reasonable ways of dealing with the degeneracy in number sum .",
    "these also correspond to two reasonable ways of eliminating absolute time ( which is measureable in a fuzzy albeit not in a sharp sense ) in order to define a direct measurement of the relative phase : a conditional measurement which takes a snapshot in absolute time ( corresponding to adding probability amplitudes ) ; and a marginal measurement which takes an average in absolute time ( corresponding to adding probabilities ) .",
    "the sense in which distinguishability is a `` matter of how long we look '' was discussed and the meaning of the general theory was illustrated by taking the two oscillators to model the right and left circularly polarized modes of an electromagnetic plane wave so that the conditional measurement reveals a snapshot of the angular distribution of the electric field vector and the marginal measurement corresponds to a quantum version of the polarization ellipse .",
    "the quantum angle representation demonstrated that any excitation of an odd number of x - polarized photons will _ never _ have an angle in correspondence with the y - axis ; but that of an even number of x - polarized photons _",
    "always _ can !",
    "the behavior of an x - polarized coherent state was examined and the snapshot angular distributions were seen to evolve into two counter - rotating peaks resulting in considerable correspondence with the y - axis ( particularly for weaker coherent states ) at the time for which a classical linear polarization vector would shrink to zero length .",
    "such an effect could be of significance for polarization based quantum communication systems since weak coherent states are sometimes used to mimic single - photon states .",
    "we also demonstrated how the probability distribution of absolute time ( now treated as a measurable quantity , rather than just a parameter ) has an influence on how these snapshot angular distributions trace out and evolve into the quantum polarization ellipse .",
    "concurrent to ( and independent of ) the development of the continuous single - mode phase representation , an alternate method for obtaining the single oscillator statistics was derived by pegg and barnett [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] . their approach requires the truncation of the infinite dimensional state space of a harmonic oscillator to one of finite but arbitrarily large dimension .",
    "this subspace , denoted @xmath21 , is spanned by the number - kets @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , their formalism relies on an ordering of terms , in a polar decomposition of the annihilation operator , which is akin to dirac s ordering [ 1 ] rather than susskind and glogower s [ 2 ] .",
    "this ordering permits them to impose an `` additional condition , '' which specifies the action on the vacuum state  whereas the action of the sg operator on the vacuum state is uniquely determined by that of @xmath4 , as mentioned .    for any number state @xmath310 , with @xmath311 but @xmath312 ,",
    "the unitary power series of pegg and barnett s operator , exp@xmath313 defined on @xmath21 , is a lowering operator .",

    "unitarity is accomplished by not having to `` stop '' at the vacuum state , but the `` wrap - around to the top of the stack '' term causes the discrete - phase wavefunctions to be complementary to a periodically replicated ( and hence truncated ) version of the @xmath317 .",

    "it is this @xmath328 limit in which they argue that the discrete phase statistics make physical sense .",
    "it should be emphasized that although pegg and barnett indeed have an hermitian phase operator on @xmath21  with @xmath23 finite ; when @xmath328 this is an alternative means of calculating the fuzzy single - mode continuous phase measurement statistics via a limiting procedure .",
    "if @xmath23 is left to be finite then their discrete phase statistics correspond to a discrete fourier transform  complementary to a truncated ( and periodically replicated ) version of the @xmath317 . in the limit",

    "herein we analyze complementarity at the first ( fuzzy ) layer , which is general in the sense that it can cover an angle , phase , or time ( in the case of a time independent hamiltonian ) when there is _ no degeneracy in the complementary eigenspectra_. to cover cases of degenerate eigenspectra one must use procedures akin to ( 61 ) and/or ( 64 ) . at layer one",
    ", the proof can be made to follow ( almost verbatim ) the case which stems from linear momentum being the generator of translations in space [ 23 ] .",
    "postulate the existence of a set of eigenstates @xmath329 which resolve the identity operator so that these correspond to a realizable measurement .",
    "furthermore , let the eigenvalues @xmath330 be continuous , non - degenerate and real valued .",
    "denote the operator which effects an infinitesimal translation in @xmath330 by @xmath331 @xmath332 the following physically reasonable properties : @xmath333 @xmath334 @xmath335 are obtained ( for _ infinitesimal _",
    "d@xmath330 ) when @xmath336 where @xmath337 is said to be the generator of translations in @xmath330 .",
    "an example of this is when @xmath330 is space and @xmath337 is proportional to linear momentum with planck s constant incorporated into its definition so that ( 77 ) is dimensionless . to progress from this to the fourier",
    "transform between representations ( and hence achieve complementarity ) we will assume that @xmath337 is hermitian ( self - adjoint ) so that its eigenspectra are real .",
    "if however , we try to take @xmath337 to be an angle operator , for example , generating finite ( not infinitesimal ) translations in @xmath145 then complications arise ( differentiation not being defined for a discrete parameter being the least of them ) and indeed these complications are trying to tell us something `` is wrong '' here which then forces us to a higher dimensional state space in order to achieve a complete description ( i.e. , a sharp measurement ) in terms of sets of commuting observables .",
    "we can however remain at the first layer and obtain an incomplete description ( i.e. , a fuzzy measurement ) if instead we take an angle to be @xmath330 .",
    "note however that in ( 73 ) there can be no `` stopping ''  as in the sense of the sg operator stopping at the vacuum .",
    "i.e. , the eigenspectra of @xmath330 must range from @xmath338 to @xmath339 else ( 73 ) can not hold @xmath340 and @xmath341  which would preclude the definition of a derivative in what follows , i.e. , ( 79 ) .",
    "_ later _ , when we find the angle distribution to be periodic mod @xmath324 ( although clearly fermions can exhibit mod @xmath342 behavior the observation of such requires their interference with another system ) _ then _ we can restrict our attention to one of these identically distributed @xmath324 intervals .    to be sure",
    ", avoidance of stopping is what leads us to ( at the second layer ) extend the sg operator to one on @xmath147 , or to define a lowering of @xmath145 on a field / particle system . rather than taking a phase operator to generate translations in photon number we can take @xmath343 as the generator of translations in @xmath26 ( as indeed it is already accepted that the hermitian hamiltonian generates translations in time , and @xmath344 generates translations in the angle about the z - axis , etc . ) and therein we can remain at the first layer and simply justify the fourier",
    "transform that leads to the fuzzy complementary measurement statistics .",
    "let @xmath345 , from ( 73 ) and ( 77 ) we have @xmath346 so that @xmath347 when we take @xmath348 to be an eigenket of @xmath337 ( and we used @xmath349 . ) the solution to this differential equation is @xmath350 , the kernel of the fourier transform , where n is a normalization constant .",
    "the presumed completeness of the @xmath351 then leads to @xmath352 i.e. , with @xmath353 we have @xmath354 from which the inverse fourier transform follows .",
    "then rayleigh s energy theorem ( or parseval s power theorem ) [ 15 ] proves that a normalized distribution in one domain will have a complementary distribution which is also normalized ( in the complementary domain ) .",
    "thus , if the eigenkets of the generator , @xmath355 , are complete in some space then the eigenkets @xmath356 are complete in that same space , proving the assumption , which concludes the proof ( at the first layer ) .",
    "if the original distribution , i.e. , that of the hermitian generator of translations , such as a hamiltonian , is continuous and aperiodic ( i.e. , not periodic ) then the complementary distribution is also continuous and aperiodic , and the two wavefunctions are related by the fourier integral transform . if the original distribution is `` rationally - discrete '' ( i.e. , in correspondence with numbers whose ratios are rational numbers ) and aperiodic , then the complementary distribution will be continuous and periodic ( the fourier series transform relationship ) .",
    "if the original distribution is aperiodic and in correspondence with a discrete set of numbers whose ratios are _ not _ rational numbers , then the complementary distribution will be continuous and `` quasi - periodic . ''",
    "lastly , if the original distribution is discrete and periodic , then the complementary distribution will be also ( the discrete fourier transform ) .",
    "thus , for any system with a rationally - discrete energy spectrum the temporal distribution will be periodic .",
    "likewise , the only system which exhibits truly discrete temporal behavior is one in which the energy distribution is truly periodic .",
    "similarly , the quantization of angular momentum ( projected onto an axis ) is the simple and immediate consequence of the periodicity of the angle about that axis .            formally a hilbert space corresponds to a non - denumerably infinite vector space ( in correspondence with the set of real numbers ) rather than a denumerably infinite space ( e.g. , in correspondence with the set of positive semi - definite integers ) .",
    "the later is occasionally referred to as a rigged hilbert space ; but it has become common practice in the literature to refer to even a finite dimensional set of vectors ( e.g. , the eigenkets of the z - component of spin for a particle of finite total spin ) as a hilbert space . since the dimensionality of the space in what follows is more than a matter of semantics we shall refer to these as a state space and reserve the phrase `` hilbert space '' to those spanned by eigenkets of unbounded real eigenvalues .                    historical note",
    ": these kets were first used by shepard and shapiro in [ 4 ] and later in [ 5 ] , for their noise reduction potential .",
    "but , it was also realized ( and finally documented by shepard in [ 7 ] and in [ 8 ] ) that they held a fundamental significance for describing a quantum phase measurement complementary to the measurement of photon number as in ( 9 ) .",
    "one might argue that the phase - kets first appeared as far back as 1976 in helstrom s [ 6 ] ml pom  but one would have to remove the `` first step '' component of that pom to achieve equivalence between ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ; as was done in [ 4 ] and [ 7 ] . interestingly",
    "( while i was trying to find a review article to reference on the approach of others ) i came across the delightful arxiv : hep - th/9304036v1 by m. m. nieto in 1992 , in which he mentions their appearance in [ 2 ] and in carruthers and nieto ( 1968 ) followed by `` to explain why this is wrong ... ''",
    "so it seems that [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and perhaps arguably [ 6 ] were the first documentations of `` how to _ use _ them right '' ( i.e. , to describe a fuzzy measurement at the first layer ) .",
    "anyway [ 7 ] appears to be the first documentation of going from the fuzzy into the sharp at the second layer in 1990 ( as in section ii ) ; and the third layer ( as in section iv ) was documented in [ 30 ] and [ 31 ] in terms of distinguishability in 1992 , whereas the notion that distinguishability _ can be _ a matter of what we chose to measure was not documented until 1993 by shepard in nasa - cp-3270 .",

    "the notion that quantum measurements correspond to hermitian operators ( which have real eigenvalues ) originally stemmed from the notion that all measurements yield real numbers . yet",
    "a complex number is merely a way of representing two real numbers simultaneously ; and no one would argue that we could not measure the operator @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the commuting ( hence simultaneously measureable ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 position operators .",
    "therein we have simply labeled the y - axis as imaginary and reported the outcome as a complex number , rather than a vector .",
    "thus we might restrict the class of realizable measurements to sets of operators which commute with their adjoint , rather than to operators which are equal to their adjoint , since then their real and imaginary components ( which are hermitian by construction ) will also commute .",
    "we have referred to such measurements as sharp and for these we have a complete description of their measurement in terms of sets of commuting hermitian operators .",
    "therein all of the conventional descriptions of quantum theory hold and the predilection for hermitian operators rightfully stems from the fact that their eigenkets are orthogonal ( hence providing the sharpness which permits wavefunction collapse ) .      in general",
    "these could be quantum fluctuations , but in our quantum optics examples these are zero - point fluctuations since therein the auxiliary system is a mode which is in the vacuum state prior to the measurement .",
    "equivalently , if we wish to describe the angle measurement in terms of operators rather than wavefunctions , a field is required so that we can generate translations in an unbounded m - space ( as exemplified by the arrows in fig . 3 within the field / particle system ) .",
    "only then can such translations be both - sided unitary and thereby define an hermitian angle operator .",
    "if we instead introduce a wrap - around term ( depicted by the semi - circle ) and stay on the finite dimensional state space of the particle then we lose complementarity .",
    "such states are also symmetric under @xmath357 , the unitary time - reversal eigenkets , which constitute a generalization of `` x - polarized '' states , in which the y - polarization mode need not be in the vacuum state .",

    "an apparatus which realizes the quantum angle measurement has yet to be realized so one must carefully consider whatever apparatus ( polarization beam splitter , etc . ) is actually used",
    ". nevertheless , the quantum phase and angle representations are so fundamental that their predictions are often discernable in other quantum measurements ."

    "<S> the meaning of relative phase is finalized at the third layer of understanding on an unrestricted two - mode space which reduces an infinite number of possible measurements to two reasonable ways of dealing with degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> these also correspond to two reasonable ways of eliminating absolute time in order to define a direct measurement of the relative phase : a conditional measurement which takes a snapshot in absolute time ( corresponding to adding probability amplitudes ) ; and a marginal measurement which takes an average in absolute time ( corresponding to adding probabilities ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sense in which distinguishability is a `` matter of how long we look '' is discussed and the meaning of the general theory is illustrated by taking the two oscillators to be photons so that the conditional measurement reveals a snapshot of the angular distribution of the electric field vector and the marginal measurement corresponds to a quantum version of the polarization ellipse . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that an odd number of x - polarized photons will _ never _ have an angle in correspondence with the y - axis ; but an even number of x - polarized photons _ always _ can ! the behavior of an x - polarized coherent state is examined and the snapshot angular distributions are seen to evolve into two counter - rotating peaks resulting in considerable correspondence with the y - axis at the time for which a classical linear polarization vector would shrink to zero length . </S>",
