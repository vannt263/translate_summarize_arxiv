    "over the last two decades , there has been considerable interest in the two dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath3 heisenberg antiferromagnet with frustrating interactions .",
    "one of the most widely studied models is the square lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model , with both nearest neighbour @xmath0 and second nearest neighbour @xmath1 antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is    @xmath6    where @xmath7 stands for summation over nearest neighbors ( nn ) while @xmath8 stands for summation over next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) .",
    "betts and oitmaa @xcite were the first to point out that there is a finite long range order in the two dimensional heisenberg model at zero temperature .",
    "early studies @xcite showed that the ground state of the pure @xmath0 model has nel order reduced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the nel order is destabilized with increasing @xmath1 and at some critical value of @xmath9 a phase transition to a quantum disordered phase occurs . on the other hand , for large @xmath9 the system will order in a `` stripe - like '' fashion of alternating rows ( or columns ) of spins up and down .",
    "the long - range magnetic order is reduced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "as @xmath9 is reduced the collinear phase will become unstable at some critical ratio .",
    "there is substantial evidence ; see refs .   and references within , that the ground state of the quantum disordered phase has no long - range magnetic order and is dominated by short - range singlet ( dimer ) formation for @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath1/@xmath0 @xmath11 @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the stability of such a configuration implies that the lattice symmetry is spontaneously broken and the ground state is fourfold degenerate .    using series expansion and mean - field spin wave theory methods , singh et al",
    ".  studied the excitation spectra of the square lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "they showed the excitation spectra is gapless at only two symmetry related points of the brillouin zone @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whereas the accidental degeneracies at @xmath16 and @xmath17 are lifted by the ` order by disorder ' effect @xcite , where the quantum fluctuations select a collinear ground state .",
    "furthermore , they found the ratio of the spin - wave velocities along the @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions depends sharply on the @xmath9 ratio .",
    "besides being of general theoretical interest the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is relevant to the real layered magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "however , the real materials are not strictly two dimensional and contain a small interlayer coupling @xmath20 .",
    "for example , rosner et .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath21 for li@xmath22vosio@xmath23 , which can be described by a square lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model with large @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this provides motivation for studies of a three dimensional extension of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "such an extension for @xmath13 has been recently studied using coupled - cluster and rotation - invariant green s function methods @xcite , a version of effective field theory @xcite as well as different kinds of spin wave approaches @xcite . in particular these studies focused on the influence of @xmath20 on the existence of an intermediate quantum disordered phase at @xmath25 .",
    "schmalfu et.al .",
    "@xcite found that upon increasing the interlayer coupling @xmath26 the intermediate phase disappears at @xmath27 .",
    "our interest in the 3d model is mainly motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in the iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "parent pnictides demonstrate alternating spin stripes and therefore it is quite natural to assume that the collinear phase of @xmath0-@xmath1 model describes the system . since their discovery , many investigations have been focused on understanding the magnetic properties of the pnictide parent compounds @xcite .",
    "magnetic long range order has been established in laofeas and sr(ba , ca)fe@xmath28as@xmath28 using neutron scattering @xcite , muon spin resonance ( @xmath29sr ) @xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the neutron studies reveal the parent compounds display a columnar antiferromagnetic ordering with a staggered magnetic moment of @xmath30 in laofeas and @xmath31 in sr(ba , ca)fe@xmath28as@xmath28 . in this columnar arrangement , stripes of parallel spin order along the @xmath32 axis and antiferromagnetically along the @xmath33 and @xmath34 axes @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnet ] .",
    "the spin wave velocities along the @xmath33 and @xmath34 axes have been measured in neutron scattering studies of srfe@xmath28as@xmath28 @xcite and bafe@xmath28as@xmath28 @xcite with @xmath35 205 mev and @xmath36 45 mev . upon lowering the temperature",
    "the parent pnictide compounds undergo a structural lattice distortion from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic structure .",
    "the orthorhombic distortion is very small , and is of order a fraction of one per cent @xcite .",
    "the structural transition happens at a temperature slightly higher or equal to the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "this coincidence naturally suggests that the structural transition can be driven by the spontaneous violation of the @xmath37 symmetry ( nematic transition ) in the spin stripe phase @xcite .",
    "note that this suggestion is based purely on symmetry arguments and is valid for both the `` localized '' and `` itinerant '' paradigm .",
    "let us call this scenario , scenario a. the structural transition can also be fully independent of the spin structure ( scenario b ) .",
    "moreover , the transition can drive the spin structure ( scenario c ) . in the present work we ignore the very small orthorhombic distortion and consider the `` isotropic '' model i.e. a tetragonal lattice . in relation to the iron",
    "pnictides this approach makes sense in cases a and b , and it is not justified in case c.    in the tetragonal phase , the fe sites form square planar arrays , such that the sites of adjacent planes lie above each other ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnet ] . recently ,",
    "there has been debate concerning the spin wave velocity along the @xmath32-axis i.e. along the spin stripes @xcite .",
    "on the one hand direct neutron scattering data from twinned samples @xcite indicate the value of @xmath38 is comparable with @xmath39 . on the other hand analysis @xcite of the nmr relaxation rate",
    "indicates an order of magnitude smaller value of @xmath38 , @xmath40 10 - 30 mev .",
    "the small value of @xmath38 implies that the system is close to a quantum critical point .",
    "therefore from now on we will refer to the small @xmath38 scenario as the _ critical _ one and the large @xmath38 scenario as the _ non - critical _ scanario .",
    "band structure calculations @xcite have shown that columnar antiferromagnetic ordering is the most stable structure . on the one hand ,",
    "band structure results indicate a local moment of up to @xmath41 per fe site @xcite .",
    "this value is too large compared to experiment .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the ordered moment might be strongly renormalized by magnetic fluctuations , as described by the frustrated 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "this suggestion implies the critical scenario because of very strong quantum fluctuations . on the other hand , there are studies suggesting that the smallness of the staggered magnetic moment can be explained by electronic effects such as hybridization and spin - orbit coupling @xcite .    motivated by what is currently known about the pnictides the goal of the present work is three - fold .",
    "first , we provide a quantitative theory for the magnetic excitations based on a minimal spin model , namely the @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model with interlayer coupling @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we will show the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses the quantum fluctuations , strengthens the staggered moment , and hence dramatically increases the stability of the columnar phase .",
    "furthermore , it has been recently suggested that the strong reduction of the magnetic moment as seen in 2d is not possible in 3d @xcite because the 3d coupling cuts the logarithmic divergence of quantum flucuations . in this paper",
    "we will show that a considerable reduction of the staggered moment is still possible for @xmath13 for small values of @xmath2 while a significant renormalization for @xmath5 is only possible for extreme fine - tuning .",
    "second , we discuss the phase diagram and the existence of a dimerized phase for the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 heisenberg model . indeed we find a dependence of the point where the staggered magnetization vanishes as a function of interlayer coupling @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , two different instabilities of the columnar phase appear : either the long - range order or one of the spin wave velocities vanishes .",
    "note that in three dimensions the vanishing of one of the spin wave velocities does _ not _ imply the vanishing of the staggered magnetization .",
    "we will discuss these two kinds of instabilities in a forthcoming publication in more detail @xcite .",
    "third , we make quantitative predictions of the dispersion and spin wave velocities parallel ( @xmath39 ) , perpendicular ( @xmath38 ) , and through ( @xmath42 ) the magnetic stripes ; the ratio @xmath43 is a useful way to determine the degree of magnetic frustration @xmath0/@xmath1 .",
    "the spin wave spectra over the full brillouin zone show dramatic differences between a system deep in the columnar phase and one close to a quantum critical point .",
    "this provides a robust experimental way to distinguish the critical and non - critical scenarios presented above .",
    "in addition , we will compare our model with experimental evidence and discuss whether the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 is an appropriate model for describing magnetism in the pnictide parent compounds .",
    "it is well known that the parent iron pnictides are not simple mott - hubbard insulators , but rather are bad metals with a very small fermi surface . on the one hand",
    "this supports an itinerant picture for the compounds while on the other hand there are many experimental indications for localized moments . on a pure theoretical level",
    "it is clear that the hubbard on - site repulsion is rather large and therefore even an itinerant system must be close to the mott - hubbard regime .",
    "most likely the truth is somewhere in the middle since there are localized and delocalized degrees of freedom , and it is not clear yet how to combine these two descriptions .    in the present work we disregard the itinerant degrees of freedom and consider a model of well - localized spins described by a heisenberg hamiltonian consisting of effective in - plane nearest neighbour @xmath0 , next nearest neighbour @xmath1 and interlayer @xmath2 exchange interactions @xmath44 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to summation over nearest - neighbour ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbour ( nnn ) pairs in the plane and @xmath45 corresponds to nearest neighbour pairs between the planes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnet ] .    since we want to describe the observed spin - stripe phase in the parent pnictides we are interested in the region of parameters of the effective heisenberg model that supports the phase .",
    "it is well known that this phase is stable at sufficiently large @xmath24 , @xmath46 .",
    "the particular values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 can be determined from comparison with known magnetic excitation spectra and we will discuss this issue later in the paper . note that we consider the `` isotropic '' heisenberg model , the value of @xmath0 is the same in both directions , along the spin stripes and perpendicular to the stripes so that we consider the entire stripe ordering to be purely spontaneous .",
    "we calculate the sublattice magnetization and magnetic excitations using self - consistent spin wave theory for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this method has already been shown to work well for @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the columnar phase for the two dimensional case @xcite .",
    "we have used the dyson - maleev @xcite as well as the schwinger boson representation @xcite which on the level of self - consistent mean field theory yield the same results for @xmath47 .",
    "the boson operators @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 on the respective sublattices , see fig .  [ fig : magnet ] ,",
    "are introduced in the usual way by performing a dyson - maleev @xcite transformation of the spin operators .",
    "@xmath52 the definition of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is similar to @xmath33 and @xmath32 . using the hamiltonian",
    "may be presented to quartic order in the operators @xmath53 , @xmath33 , @xmath54 and @xmath32    @xmath55    we perform the hartree - fock mean field decoupling of quartic terms using the following notations .",

    "there exists also a second branch of spin waves for @xmath100 and @xmath101 which have not yet been observed experimentally .",

    "basically these figures show the phase diagram of the model as it results from self - consistent spin wave theory . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the regions above the lines correspond to the columnar spin - stripe phase and the regions below them correspond to the columnar spin - dimerized phase .",
    "it is well known that the transition between these phases is of first order .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the criterion of a vanishing magnetization is not quite the correct one to indicate the transition , the true transition happens at a slightly smaller value of @xmath65 than that indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stable - s12 ] .",

    ", that the criterion gives practically the correct value of the critical point for @xmath107 . here",

    "[ fig : staggered ] we observe an interesting behaviour of @xmath108 as a function of increasing interlayer coupling . in the vicinity of @xmath109 and for small values of @xmath19",
    "the renormalized magnetization changes very rapidly on small parameter changes , differing significantly from linear spin wave theory calculations even for @xmath5 .",
    "this clearly indicates strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are stronger for @xmath13 , see for instance the larger deviation of the region of instability from the value @xmath109 , than for @xmath5 ( compare fig .",

    "we would like to briefly comment on the intermediate quantum phases for @xmath3 and @xmath4 near @xmath110 .",
    "there is a consensus that in the @xmath3 two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model there is an intermediate magnetically disordered phase at @xmath111 .",
    "we believe that this is the columnar spin dimer - phase . according to our data for the 3d model presented in fig .",

    "the critical value of @xmath2 for disappearance of the magnetically disordered phase differs from that determined previously @xcite by the couple - cluster method , @xmath113 .",
    "we do not think that the difference in the value is significant , both our method and the method of ref .",
    "are approximate .",
    "more importantly , there is qualitative agreement about the phase diagram .",

    "this is qualitatively different from previous studies  @xcite that were unable to identify an intermediate phase .",
    "note the very small scale on which we find the instability of the columnar stripe order .",
    "unfortunately within the present method we can not determine the exact nature of the phase and therefore in fig .",
    "[ fig : stable - s1 ] the phase is shown by a question mark .",
    "the ratio of the spin wave velocities along the different directions is very sensitive to the value @xmath106 .",
    "the point is that in a real compound the staggered magnetization can depend on a range of additional uncontrolled variables such as itinerancy , hybridization , etc .",
    "the dispersion relation however only depends on the effective hamiltonian and thus is less ambiguous @xcite .",
    "our results for the spin wave velocities along the three crystal axes are shown in fig .",

    "the dependence of the ratios of the spin wave velocities on the values of the exchange couplings is stronger than the corresponding dependence of the staggered magnetization .",

    "we stress that the data is not consistent with the `` isotropic '' heisenberg model considered in the present work because of the minute orthorhombic distortion . on the other hand ,",
    "the data is consistent with the anisotropic heisenberg model , see discussion in ref .",
    "the anisotropic heisenberg model implies that there are additional degrees of freedom ( orbital ? ) and it is outside of the scope of the present work .",
    "it has been recently suggested that the strong reduction of the magnetic moment possible in two dimensions @xcite is not possible for substantial three dimensional coupling and/or magnetic anisotropy because these additional couplings dramatically suppress the quantum corrections to the ordered moment @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the quantum corrections to the staggered magnetisation seen in the square lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model for @xmath149 is cut off by the addition of either an anisotropy gap or a third dimension . in fig .",
    "[ fig : staggered ] we do indeed see an enhancement of the staggered magnetisation compared to the two dimensional case @xcite for increasing values of @xmath19 for @xmath13 and @xmath5 .",
    "since the quantum fluctuations are more significant for @xmath13 than for @xmath5 their suppression by the three dimensional coupling is seen more distinctly in the @xmath13 data than in the @xmath5 data . in particular , close to the critical values @xmath150 , where the columnar striped phase becomes unstable due to quantum fluctuations , the suppression for increasing three - dimensional coupling @xmath151 is most clearly seen , cf .",

    "the quantitative difference between the results for @xmath13 and for @xmath5 is most strikingly seen in the difference of scales of the figs .",
    "[ fig : stable - s12 ] and [ fig : stable - s1 ] .",
    "we have provided a quantitative theory for the magnetic excitations on a tetragonal lattice based on a minimal spin model , namely the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 heisenberg model .",
    "first , we have shown that the columnar phase is stabilized by the introduction of the interlayer coupling @xmath2 .",
    "such a three - dimensional coupling dramatically strengthens the staggered magnetization and suppresses the strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "since for the @xmath3 case the staggered magnetization is more strongly renormalized by the quantum fluctuations than for @xmath5 the effects of the suppression of the quantum fluctuations are more clearly seen for @xmath13 than for @xmath5 . yet",
    "both spin species behave qualitatively the same    in addition , we have also shown that the position of the critical point depends on the value of of the relative interlayer coupling @xmath19 . again , this dependence is more significant for @xmath13 than for @xmath5 because the influence of quantum fluctuations and thus also of their suppression is stronger for smaller spin than for larger spin . as function of @xmath19 we found to distinct ways",
    "how the columnar phase becomes unstable .",
    "either the magnetization or one of the spin wave velocities vanishes .",
    "second , the strong reduction of the magnetic moment is possible in three dimensions if one considers small values of @xmath19 .",
    "one has to approach @xmath150 very closely even for @xmath13 .",
    "third , we have shown that one can conveniently model @xmath152 for small @xmath19 analytically .    finally , comparing the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 heisenberg model with experimental data we found that such a model does not explain the data @xcite .",
