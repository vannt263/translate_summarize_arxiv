    "in parrondo s game  @xcite , in its usually form as a gambling game , a single agent plays against a bank , with the choice of two games @xmath0 and @xmath1 , whose results are determined by the toss of biased coins .",
    "each of these games is losing when played in isolation but when played alternately or in some other deterministic or random sequence ( such as @xmath2 etc . )",
    "can become a winning game . because of its anti - intuitive nature , parrondo s games are also referred to as parrondo s paradox .",
    "game @xmath1 is constructed in such a way that there is a form of feedback from the game state that , when the game is played by itself , causes the game to be a losing game . interspersing plays of game @xmath0 disrupts the feedback and the net result can be a winning game",
    ". the feedback can be in the form of dependence on the total capital of the player  @xcite , on the history of previous wins and losses  @xcite or , in a multiplayer setting , on the performance of neighbouring players  @xcite .",
    "interest in quantum models of parrondo s games was initiated by meyer  @xcite , who presented a model analogous to the capital - dependent parrondo s game , and was later extended to the history - dependent model  @xcite .",
    "a close quantum analogue of the capital dependent parrondo s game was also developed by kosk  @xcite .",
    "a quantum analogue of a classical discrete random walk can be obtained by replacing the classical coin by an su(2 ) operator .",
    "if the walker position on a one - dimensional line represents the player s total capital , a quantum walk becomes a natural setting for a quantum parrondo s game .",
    "as distinct from the classical case , in a quantum setting the change from winning to losing may be achieved by interference effects between the two games .    in the quantum parrondo s game model of ref .",
    "@xcite two players a and b play alternately .",
    "winning for player a is defined as motion to the right while motion to the left is defined as winning for player b. it is then obvious that when a and b use their coins alternately that one or the other of them will ` win ' , or that the expectation of the walker position will be zero , in which case the players are joint winners , according to the authors criteria .",
    "this does not have the anti - intuitive aspect that is characteristic of parrondo s games nor is it a single player with a choice of two games .",
    "a two - dimensional analogue of this idea has also appeared as an e - print  @xcite . despite its failure to meet the criterion as a parrondo s game the idea used in refs .",
    "@xcite of biasing a quantum walk using phase factors can be used to construct a version of a quantum parrondo s game that relies on quantum interference to produce the counter - intuitive motion of the walker in a one - dimensional quantum walk .    in this paper",
    "we first introduce quantum walks and discuss how to control them using the coin parameters and the initial state .",
    "this is well covered in the literature and is included here briefly only for completeness . in sec .",
    "[ sec : our_model ] the new quantum parrondo s model is presented and sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] presents results for all combinations of games @xmath0 and @xmath1 of length four or less , giving the regions in parameter space for which the effect can be achieved .",
    "it will be noticed that although the expectation of the walker position is reversed for some finite number of time steps , eventually the original bias reasserts itself .",
    "thus we term this phenomena _ transient _ quantum parrondo s games .",
    "the usefulness of classical random walks in mathematics , theoretical computer science and computational physics  @xcite has inspired significant interest in quantum walks , both in continuous - time  @xcite and in discrete - time  @xcite .",
    "quantum walks reveal a number of startling differences to their classical counterparts .",
    "in particular , diffusion on a line is quadratically faster @xcite , while propagation across some graphs is exponentially faster @xcite .",
    "quantum walks also show promise as a means of implementing some quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "an overview of quantum walks is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and a recent comprehensive review appears in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if a quantum particle moving in discrete time steps along a line is updated at each step , in superposition , to the left and right , the global process is necessarily non - unitary  @xcite .",
    "however , an additional degree of freedom , the chirality , taking values @xmath3 and @xmath4 , allows unitary quantum walks to be constructed . let @xmath5 be the hilbert space of discrete particle positions in one - dimension , spanned by the basis @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the hilbert space of chirality , or `` coin '' states , spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath8 . a discrete - time",
    ", discrete - space quantum walk on the hilbert space @xmath9 consists of a unitary operation @xmath10 on the coin state , followed by the updating of the position to the left or right according to the result , that is , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the shift operator in position space , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the identity operator in position space , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are projection operators on the coin space with @xmath17 , the coin identity operator .",
    "for example , a walk controlled by an unbiased quantum coin can be carried out by the transformations @xmath18 to achieve an unbiased quantum walk with eq .",
    "( [ eq : step1 ] ) we require an initial state @xmath19 .",
    "the scheme is then equivalent to the hadamard quantum walk with initial state @xmath20 .",
    "tregenna _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has shown that with a general initial state @xmath21 and with a coin operator of maximum generality ( up to an overall phase ) @xmath22 @xmath23 disappears in the final dynamics , while @xmath24 only appears in the combination @xmath25 . both @xmath26 and @xmath27 have non - trivial effects on the dynamics but an unbiased walk requires @xmath28 .",
    "in the following we will chose the initial state @xmath19 , and a more symmetrical form of the coin operator , @xmath29 obtained by multiplying the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_flip ] ) by an overall phase @xmath30 , and setting @xmath31 . with @xmath28 and @xmath32 an unbiased quantum walk is obtained . however , with @xmath28 a bias can be introduced , to the left or right , by the use of a non - zero phase factor @xmath33 . if we restrict @xmath34 $ ] , then @xmath35 causes average motion to the left while @xmath36 causes motion to the right .",
    "introduce the operators @xmath37 for some @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "connection with parrondo s games can now be obtained by choosing to use @xmath39 and @xmath40 for games @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , with both @xmath41 .",
    "thus , quantum walks generated by either @xmath39 or @xmath40 alone are biased towards the negative ( ` losing ' ) .",
    "the loss is an approximately linear function of the number of time steps @xmath42 .",
    "for example , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , for some choices of @xmath33 and @xmath45 , and some combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , interference effects can reverse the dynamics giving a positive expectation value of the walker position ( ` winning ' ) , at least up to some finite number of time steps . alternately playing @xmath0",
    "then @xmath1 @xmath46-times from the initial state @xmath47 produces a final state @xmath48 given by @xmath49 the final states for other sequences are produced analogously .",
    "all repeated sequences of four games were tested . of these ,",
    "only @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 were found to give some positive expectation for the walker position after 100 time steps . in each case",
    "there is only a small region of values of the phase parameters @xmath33 and @xmath45 that give rise to the positive positions , as indicated in figs  [ f : ab100][f : abbb100 ] .",
    "note that interchanging games @xmath0 and @xmath1 only has the effect of reversing the role of @xmath33 and @xmath45 and gives no new dynamics . the results for game @xmath0 alone can be obtained by setting @xmath53 . in each case",
    "this results in a more negative value of @xmath54 for a given number of time steps @xmath42 than the alternating sequence for near - by values of @xmath55 .    for a sufficiently large number of time steps",
    "all sequences eventually show a return to a negative expectation value for the walker position . some examples of the expectation value of the walker for the first 1000 time steps are shown in figs .",
    "ab_change_ab][f : abbb_change_ab ] , for the sequences @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the solid ( near ) straight lines in the right hand figures indicate the result for playing game @xmath0 only , for @xmath56 .",
    "these graphs indicate that @xmath54 has an oscillatory pattern superimposed upon a downward trend .",
    "decreasing @xmath33 leads to a lessening of the downward slope , while decreasing @xmath45 leads to longer periods of oscillation . a short period , low amplitude oscillation is superimposed upon the longer one .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation becomes more pronounced as we go from the sequence @xmath50 to @xmath51 to @xmath52 , as close inspection of the figures show .",
    "we have shown that a quantum walk on a line can give rise to a transient quantum parrondo s game .",
    "two different biased coin operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 play the role of the two games in the parrondo effect .",
    "bias is achieved by adding a phase factor to the coin operator .",
    "although each operator , when used alone , gives negative expectation values for the walker position as the number of steps increases , when used in the repeated sequences @xmath50 , @xmath51 or @xmath52 can give rise to movement in the positive direction , for some values of the phase factors .",
