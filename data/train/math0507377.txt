    "the shapiro conjecture for grassmannians  @xcite has driven progress in enumerative real algebraic geometry  @xcite , which is the study of real solutions to geometric problems .",
    "it conjectures that a ( zero - dimensional ) intersection of schubert subvarieties of a grassmannian consists entirely of real points  if the schubert subvarieties are given by flags osculating a real rational normal curve .",
    "this particular schubert intersection problem is quite natural ; it can be interpreted in terms of real linear series on @xmath0 with prescribed ( real ) ramification  @xcite , real rational curves in @xmath1 with real flexes  @xcite , linear systems theory  @xcite , and the bethe ansatz and fuchsian equations  @xcite .",
    "the shapiro conjecture has implications for all these areas .",
    "massive computational evidence  @xcite as well as its proof by eremenko and gabrielov for grassmannians of codimension 2 subspaces  @xcite give compelling evidence for its validity . a local version , that it holds when the schubert varieties are special ( a technical term ) and when the points of osculation are sufficiently clustered  @xcite , showed that the special schubert calculus is fully real ( such geometric problems can have all their solutions real ) .",
    "vakil later used other methods to show that the general schubert calculus on the grassmannian is fully real .",
    "@xcite    the original shapiro conjecture stated that such an intersection of schubert varieties in a would consist entirely of real points .",
    "unfortunately , this conjecture fails for the first non - trivial enumerative problem on a non - grassmannian flag manifold , but in a very interesting way .",
    "failure for flag manifolds was first noted in  @xcite and a more symmetric counterexample was found in  @xcite , where computer experimentation suggested that the conjecture would hold if the points where the flags osculated the rational normal curve satisfied a certain non - crossing condition .",
    "further experimentation led to a precise formulation of this refined non - crossing conjecture in  @xcite .",
    "that conjecture was only valid for two- and three- step flag manifolds , and the further experimentation reported here leads to versions ( conjectures  [ c : main ] and  [ c : new_main ] ) for all flag manifolds in which the points of osculation satisfy a monotonicity condition .",
    "we have systematically investigated the shapiro conjecture for flag manifolds to gain a deeper understanding both of its failure and of our refinement .",
    "this investigation includes 15.76 gigahertz - years of computer experimentation , theorems relating our conjecture for different enumerative problems , and its proof in some cases using discriminants .",
    "recently , our conjecture was proven by eremenko , gabrielov , shapiro , and vainshtein  @xcite for manifolds of flags consisting of a codimension 2 plane lying on a hyperplane .",
    "our experimentation also uncovered some new and interesting phenomena in the schubert calculus of a flag manifold , and it included substantial computation in support of the shapiro conjecture on the grassmannians @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",

    "we computed 400,000 instances of this polynomial system at different choices of points @xmath19 ( which were monotone ) , and each had 12 real solutions .",
    "in contrast , there were many non - monotone choices of points for which not all solutions were real , and the minimum number of real solutions that we observe seems to depend on the combinatorics of the evaluation .",
    "for example , the system with interlaced points @xmath14 @xmath20 has 12 solutions , of which are real .",

    "section 4.3 discusses the design of the experiment , that is , how we chose which schubert problems to investigate .",
    "all computations were done on intel processors running linux , using the computer algebra systems singular 2 - 0 - 5  @xcite and maple , which were called from bash shell scripts .",
    "maple managed the data , created the singular scripts , and counted the real solutions to univariate eliminants .    to study a schubert intersection",
    ", we generated the ideal of the intersection in local coordinates @xmath515 parametrizing the schubert cell @xmath516 .",
    "for this , we fixed @xmath226 , and the other points @xmath411 were rational numbers , and the ideal was generated by the equations for each schubert variety @xmath566 as described in section  [ s : basics ] and in section  [ s : sc ] ( where the flags @xmath567 were described ) . because grbner basis computation is extremely sensitive to the number of variables , the first schubert condition @xmath568 was chosen to minimize the number of coordinates in the parametrization @xmath515 of the schubert cell @xmath516 .",
    "singular computed a degree reverse lexicographic grbner basis for this ideal and then used the fglm algorithm  @xcite to compute a square - free univariate eliminant with degree equal to the degree of the schubert problem .",
    "this guaranteed that the original intersection was transverse and that its number of real points is equal to the number of real roots of the eliminant ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "this number of real roots was computed using the realroot command in maple .",
    "when such an eliminant could not be computed , data describing the intersection were set aside and later studied by hand .      for a given schubert problem @xmath96",
    ", we determined the number of real points in many different schubert intersections of the form  .",
    "once a problem was selected , data necessary for the experimentation were precomputed and stored in a data file .",
    "these data included a list @xmath569 of permutations of the numbers @xmath570 and a set @xmath220 of rational numbers .",
    "the list @xmath569 typically consisted of one permutation representing each necklace we decided to investigate .",
    "this data file was updated throughout the computation as it also recorded the numbers of real solutions found for the different necklaces and for different choices of points .",
    "most schubert problems were run on a single computer .",
    "the actual computation was organized by a shell script , whose main part was a loop . in each iteration , the loop variable was used as a seed for maple s random - number generator to select a random subset @xmath411 of the points from @xmath220 , which were ordered so that @xmath571 . for each permutation @xmath121 of @xmath569 ,",
    "the number of real points in the intersection @xmath572 was determined and included in the data file .",
    "the data file also kept track of the cpu time used in the computation , and recorded the average size of the univariate eliminants . the number of iterations of the shell script depended upon our interest in the problem and the computational cost .    after the computations were completed for a given schubert problem , the data file",
    "was used to generate a web page which displayed information from the experimentation on that schubert problem .",
    "figure  [ fig : html_page ] illustrates a typical such page .",
    "this web page has a key in the form of a table with one row for each schubert condition .",
    "each row shows the condition as a permutation , then in a shorthand that is well - suited to grassmannian conditions  the letter indicates which member of the flag it is imposed upon and the partition index indicates the corresponding schubert condition on the grassmannian .",
    "next is the symbol for that condition used when listing the necklaces , and finally its codimension .",
    "the figure under shows the positions of the points in @xmath220 on @xmath163 , represented as a circle where the point at the top is @xmath211 .",
    "this web page also records the total computation time , the machine used ( noether is a computer owned by sarah witherspoon ) , the total number of polynomial systems solved , and the size of a typical eliminant .",

    "only a small fraction of feasible schubert problems were investigated on the other 18 flag manifolds .",
    "there were limitations of resources which made choices necessary .",
    "for example , the complexity of grbner basis computation limited us to schubert problems of low degree ( typically fewer than 20 solutions ) .",
    "for the computations on grassmannians , a more advantageous choice of local coordinates was possible , which allowed significantly larger problems  we studied one problem on @xmath3 with 91 solutions .",
    "many schubert problems had literally thousands of necklaces , such as the problem of table  [ table:11352 ] with 11,352 neckalces . a systematic study of all necklaces for such a problem would be infeasible and the data would be incomprehensible .",
    "we did consider all 1272 necklaces for one such problem .",
    "limiting our investigation to problems of small degree and with few necklaces would still have been infeasible , as there are many thousands of such smaller schubert problems on some of these flag manifolds .    on the flag manifolds for which it was impossible to investigate all schubert problems , we studied most feasible grassmannian schubert problems , as well as many related to these grassmannian problems through projection , lifting , fibration , and the notion of child problems as discussed in sections  [ s : t_simple ] and  [ s : projections ] .",
