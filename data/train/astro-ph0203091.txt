    "the study of the early universe through high - redshift galaxies has seen substantial progress in recent times , with a number of galaxies discovered at redshifts @xmath13 ( @xcite ; hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ; @xcite ; hu , mcmahon , & cowie 1999 ; @xcite ) .",
    "active galaxies associated with radio galaxies @xcite have been seen to similar redshifts and quasars have now been detected out to @xmath14 from the sloan survey @xcite .",
    "the present letter describes a continuation of our narrowband filter survey @xcite , which probes ly@xmath1 emission from @xmath15 , to a redshift @xmath16 . at @xmath17",
    "the brightest ly@xmath1 emitters have line fluxes near @xmath18 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 and a single , roughly 30 arcmin@xmath19 field of the lris camera on the keck 10 m telescope yields a handful of objects to a flux limit of @xmath20 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 . at @xmath16",
    "the fluxes drop to near the sensitivity limit and only occasional objects are expected to be found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , to improve our sensitivity limits we have targeted foreground massive lensing clusters which can provide substantial amplification over a fraction of the lris field .",
    "we have also observed the well studied blank fields used in the shorter wavelength narrowband searches .",
    "even with the increased sensitivity provided by the lensing detections are extremely rare and our observations have so far yielded only one compelling detection lying behind the cluster a370 .",
    "we describe this object in the present letter",
    ".    discriminating ly@xmath1 emitters from lower @xmath21 emission - line objects can be difficult at lower redshifts @xcite , but as we move to higher redshifts the continuum break signature becomes so extreme that there is little likelihood of a misidentification provided we have sufficiently deep continuum images .",
    "songaila and cowie @xcite have used spectra of the sloan quasars to measure the average transmission of the ly@xmath1 forest region as a function of redshift over the @xmath22 range .",
    "their results translate to a magnitude break across the ly@xmath1 emission line of @xmath23 extrapolated to @xmath24 this corresponds to a 4.5 magnitude break .",
    "if the epoch of reionization is at @xmath25 as suggested by @xcite , the continuum blueward of ly@xmath1 would be essentially black .",
    "however , as we shall consider further in the discussion section , in this case the radiation damping wings of the foreground neutral hydrogen extend through the ly@xmath1 emission and make it unlikely we would see ly@xmath1 emitters at all , so the presence of the a370 emitter argues for a higher reionization redshift .    in section  [ secdata ]",
    "we summarize the narrowband observations and the continuum observations at longer and shorter wavelengths together with the spectroscopic followup .",
    "the properties of hcm 6a leave little doubt about its identification as a high-@xmath21 ly@xmath1 emitter .",
    "finally , in the discussion we consider the implications for early star formation and for the evolution of the intergalactic gas .",
    "the present images were obtained using a 118    filter centered on 9152   in the lris camera @xcite on the keck 10 m telescopes .",
    "this wavelength lies in a very dark region of the night sky between the oh(8 - 4 ) and oh(7 - 3 ) bands , and corresponds to ly@xmath1 at a redshift of @xmath26 . in total",
    ", six fields have been imaged with this filter , and are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] . in each case",
    "the exposures were made as a sequence of spatially dithered background - limited exposures and median skys were used to flat field the images .",
    "the images were calibrated with spectrophotometric standards .",
    "the deepest exposures , totaling about 6 hours per field , were taken on the hdf and on fields centered on the clusters a370 and .",
    "over most of the area in these fields the 5 sigma limiting flux sensitivity is approximately @xmath27 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 but , for the massive clusters , there is a small area in the central regions where the lensing amplification provides a significant gain in sensitivity .    for each field a very deep @xmath28 band ( @xmath29  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to measure the continuum and an extremely deep @xmath30-band image was used as a shorter wavelength reference to measure the continuum break .",
    "we searched each field for objects with observed equivalent widths in excess of 100    which were not visible in the @xmath31 image . only one such object has been found in the six fields . finding images for hcm 6a , which lies behind the massive lensing cluster a370 in a region of significant amplification , are shown in figure  [ fig1:z6-compare ] , which compares narrowband and deep @xmath31 continuum images and gives coordinates .",
    "insets show the continuum - subtracted image and the corresponding wfpc2 f675w image from hst .",
    "( see @xcite for a description of the wider field of the hst image ) .",
    "the following subsections describe the observations made on this object to confirm that it is a high redshift ly@xmath1 emitter rather than a lower redshift emission - line object .",
    "deep multicolor images of a370 were obtained using lris on the keck 10 m telescopes on ut 1999 august 11 , 1999 september 910 , 2000 august 25 , and 2000 december 29 and 2002 january 1112 .",
    "the data were taken as a sequence of dithered exposures , with net integration times of 2400 s in @xmath32 , 27900 s in @xmath30 , 4050 s in @xmath33 and 9820 s in @xmath34 . a deep @xmath35 ( 3780 s ) image",
    "was obtained with esi on keck ii on ut 2000 september 2930 .",
    "the images were processed using median sky flats generated from the exposures .",
    "conditions were photometric during these observations .",
    "the data were calibrated using the photometric and spectrophotometric standard , hz4 @xcite , and faint landolt standard stars in the sa 95 - 42 field @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,^ \" , ]      we used the new cooled infrared spectrograph and camera for ohs ( cisco , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the subaru 8.3  m telescope on ut 2000 june 18 - 19 , july 15 - 16 , september 10 - 12 , and november 7 to obtain extremely deep @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 images of a370 .",
    "the detector used was a @xmath36 hgcdte hawaii array with a pixel scale of @xmath37 .",
    "this provides a field - of - view of @xmath38 . to minimize the image degradation ,",
    "a number of sub - exposures were taken at each position in an eight - point pentagon pattern ( @xmath39 step size ) .",
    "weather conditions were photometric , and the seeing was typically @xmath40 during the first three observing runs , which was also the resolution of nearly all the final reduced images .",
    "conditions were clear , but with variable seeing during the november observing run , with characteristic image fwhm of @xmath41 for the a370 @xmath8 final image .",
    "the data were processed using median sky flats generated from the dithered images .",
    "the data were calibrated from observations of the ukirt faint standards @xcite fs27 , fs29 , fs6 , and fs10 .",
    "the total exposure times were 13280  s ( @xmath7 ) , 7680  s ( @xmath8 ) , and 15360  s ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "hcm 6a is clearly detected at all wavelengths longer than the @xmath28 band as is shown in figure  [ fig2:z6-multi - image ] , where we present thumbnail images centered on the object , which is circled ( left column ) .",
    "however , it is not seen at any shorter wavelengths ( right column ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of hcm 6a is shown in figure  [ fig3:a370 - 6-sed ] , where the error bars are 1 sigma . at wavelengths above the @xmath28 band the mean flux density averaged over the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 bands",
    "is @xmath42 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 while at shorter wavelengths averaged over the @xmath43 and @xmath31 bands the flux density is @xmath44 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 . at the 2 sigma level the continuum break exceeds 1.7 magnitudes .",
    "spectra of the object were obtained with the lris spectrograph during a runs in ut 1618 september 1999 , 2324 january 2001 , and 21 october 2001 .",
    "the observations were made in multislit mode using 1.4@xmath45 wide slits with a variety of gratings .",
    "the emission line is clearly seen in all the spectra , and the stacked spectra show the line profile to be asymmetric , with steeper blue fall - off as would be expected from the effects of the forest absorption .",
    "the redward continuum is most clearly seen in the spectra obtained with the 400 l / mm grating , which in combination with the slit width gives a resolution of roughly 11.8  , and we show the combined spectra obtained in this mode in figure  [ fig4:a370 - 6-spec ] .",
    "the strong emission line is at a wavelength of 9187  , which corresponds to a redshift of @xmath0 for lyman alpha .",
    "the continuum break is consistent with that obtained from the imaging data but is more poorly determined because of the uncertainties in the sky subtraction in the spectra .",
    "the absence of detections outside the cluster lensing regions places a 1 sigma upper limit of 27 deg@xmath46 for the number of sources in the filter bandpass ( @xmath47 ) at the 5 @xmath48 flux limit of @xmath49 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 ( the hdf limit ) and 13 deg@xmath46 at @xmath50 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 ( the worst limit in the six fields ) , which is broadly consistent with that expected from models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or extrapolation from lower redshifts .",
    "we have used the lenstool model of a370 described in @xcite to measure an amplification of 4.5 at the position of hcm 6a , giving a demagnified flux of @xmath51 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "lenstool also allows us to measure the corresponding source plane areas which would give such amplifications . for the combined a370 , , and areas",
    "the observed source plane area is 0.46 arcmin@xmath19 , with most of this area lying behind the most massive ( a370 ) cluster .",
    "the surface density of objects above a flux limit of @xmath52 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 is then between 1300 and 26000 deg@xmath6 , where the range is @xmath53 , which is also broadly consistent with the model expectations .",
    "equivalent width determination for very high-@xmath21 objects is complicated by the strong forest absorption on the blue side of the emission feature , and across the @xmath28 band .",
    "for the 1 arcsec diameter aperture measurements shown in figure  [ fig3:a370 - 6-sed ] the equivalent width determined from the line flux and the average long - wavelength continuum flux above the emission feature is 190  .",
    "if instead the average @xmath34-band continuum is used as the reference value , the computed equivalent width increases to 325  .",
    "the brighter region of the object is clearly extended along an axis of about 110@xmath54 in pa with a maximum length of around @xmath55 .",
    "the elongation is consistent with the substantial distortion expected at this position if the galaxy lies at very high redshift , providing an additional weak confirmation of the redshift identification .",
    "the intrinsic size of the main region at the source plane is then around @xmath56 .",
    "the second fragment lies around @xmath56 away from the brighter portion . at @xmath0 with the currently favored lambda cosmology ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 these angular sizes correspond to physical sizes of approximately 40 kpc .    after removing the lensing amplification",
    "the continuum flux corresponds to a rest frame ultraviolet luminosity of @xmath60 erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 , which may be used to estimate the star formation rate . for a salpeter imf extending to 0.1 @xmath61 ,",
    "this is about 40 @xmath61 yr@xmath6 .",
    "the rest frame demagnified ly@xmath1 luminosity is @xmath62 erg s@xmath6 which , assuming case b recombination and using kennicutt s @xcite translation of h@xmath1 luminosity to star formation rate , would correspond to a rate of 2 @xmath61 yr@xmath6 .",
    "the lower value obtained from the ly@xmath1 luminosity presumably reflects the combined effects of dust extinction in the galaxy and destruction of the blue side of the emission line by scattering in the intergalactic medium .    using the more robust uv continuum estimate we find that the universal star formation rate at this redshift from this class of object lies in the range @xmath63 mpc@xmath64 yr@xmath6 ( @xmath53 )",
    "this is quite similar to rates estimated at lower redshifts within the very large uncertainty ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    perhaps of most interest ,",
    "given this is a single object and statistical inferences are therefore difficult , is that the presence of even a single object at this redshift may suggest we have not yet reached the redshift of reionization . in a pre - reionization epoch the radiation damping wings from the neutral gas will black out regions extending about 20   to the redward of the ly@xmath1 wavelength in the observed frame of the object @xcite .",
    "while ultraluminous quasars can ionize their surroundings and prevent this effect , it is unlikely that a small ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy of the present type could do this though it could lie in a large ionized region produced by some other source of ionizing photons .",
    "this work was supported in part by the state of hawaii and by nsf grant ast-0071208 and nasa grant go-7266.01 - 96a from space telescope science institute , which is operated by aura , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
