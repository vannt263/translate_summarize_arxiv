    "photonic quantum - enhanced technologies aim to employ nonclassical states of light to surpass classical performance limits in diverse fields including computation  @xcite , metrology  @xcite , and communication  @xcite .",
    "an impediment to faster progress is the quality of available single photon sources .",
    "building the low - loss sources of high purity single photons necessary for quantum - enhanced performance has proven challenging  @xcite .    heralding spontaneous emission from a nonlinear - optical material has to date been the most common method of generating single photons  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear processes such as spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) or spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) can be used to create pairs of photons .",
    "due to this pairwise emission , detection of one photon , the heralding photon , indicates the creation of its partner , the heralded single photon .",
    "a key source metric is the preparation efficiency @xmath6 , the conditional probability that a heralded photon is delivered to its application given detection of the heralding photon .",
    "for example , the rate at which multiphoton states are generated from single - photon sources scales exponentially with @xmath6 , even with multiplexing strategies which ideally achieve near - deterministic emission  @xcite . in numerous applications",
    ", @xmath6 is a crucial parameter for a quantum method to demonstrate true advantage over a classical approach  @xcite .",
    "four - wave mixing in a silica waveguide is a promising route to achieving exceptionally high @xmath6  @xcite . in heralded photon sources ,",
    "reduction in @xmath6 results from loss of the heralded photon , due to scattering or imperfect mode - matching at interfaces .",
    "waveguides in commonly available silica glasses minimize these effects due to their exceedingly low optical loss and excellent mode - matching to optical fiber , a ubiquitous component in quantum photonics . while silica s relatively small @xmath7 nonlinearity affects the emitted photon flux , in many applications it is loss that is fundamental to demonstrating quantum enhancement , not flux .",
    "in fact , for heralded single photon sources one must deliberately keep emission rates low to avoid unwanted heralding of more than one photon .",
    "the transverse confinement of the waveguide allows these desired photon production rates to be reached at readily available pump powers .",
    "typical quantum applications require heralded photons in pure quantum states in addition to high source @xmath6 . in general , however , the heralded pair source generates mixed quantum states .",
    "energy and momentum conservation can lead to entanglement between multiple spatial and spectral modes of the emitted photon pairs  @xcite . if the heralding photon is detected but its mode is not resolved , then the heralded photon is left in a mixed quantum state of all possible modes .",
    "one approach to achieve a high - purity heralded photon is to use spectral and spatial filters on the heralding field which ensures the detector responds to only a single spatio - temporal mode .",
    "such filters reduce the rate at which heralded photons are emitted . on - chip",
    "spdc sources are capable of high photon flux  @xcite that allows acceptable count rates even when filters are used to achieve good photon purity . for sfwm in silica , on the other hand , the reduced count rate from this approach could lead to unacceptably long data collection times .",
    "an alternate approach we employ here is to engineer the source to emit photons into a single pair of modes . as a consequence , the heralding and heralded photon",
    "are not entangled .",
    "the resulting factorable output allows heralded photons of high purity without filtering .",
    "guided - wave photonics allows the precise control of optical modes needed to construct such a source .",
    "previous silica sources have demonstrated this strategy using optical fibers . in these structures , however , fabrication inhomogeneity  @xcite or sensitivity to the local environment  @xcite prevented a robust scalable solution . while on - chip sfwm sources have been demonstrated in chalcogenide glass  @xcite and silicon  @xcite , these devices exhibited relatively high loss and did not pursue the factorable source design strategy described here .",
    "here we report the first photon source on a silica photonic chip .",

    "heralded single photons are emitted at a rate of @xmath10 photons per second with a pump field power of @xmath11 mw .",
    "we use a birefringent waveguide to phasematch sfwm at frequencies where the red - detuned photon lies far beyond silica s raman gain peak .",
    "this minimizes spontaneous raman scattering  @xcite , which is the principal noise source in many silica sources  @xcite .",
    "a solid - clad silica waveguide provides a convenient and robust platform for our source which we foresee finding immediate application in integrated quantum optics experiments that frequently rely on similar integrated silica architectures  @xcite .",
