    "stochastic resonance ( sr ) phenomena were first discovered in connection with periodically recurrent glacial age . since then",
    "this phenomenon has been found to occur in various fields and has been attracting wide attention . in short sr is phenomenon whereby , in contrast to common sense , added noise seems to help to amplify a signal .",
    "let us briefly review sr phenomenon using the bistable potential model , driven by a periodic perturbation .",
    "a classical particle in a potential @xmath1 , which has two local minima , is perturbed by a periodic external force with an amplitude @xmath2 and a frequency @xmath3 under the influence of noise ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the amplitude @xmath2 is small , the particle in one of the stable states can not go over the potential barrier to the other stable state [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , in other words , the system does not respond to the input perturbation .",
    "the addition of noise changes the situation ; now the    = 0.94    particle is kicked by the random force and can go over the barrier .",
    "however if the noise is too strong the response to the input signal may be smeared .",
    "this is because in this case the particle moves randomly irrespective of the periodicity of the perturbation [ fig .",
    "however at a certain added noise strength the particle can be made to travel back and forth between the two stable state , _ synchronizing with periodic perturbation of frequency @xmath3 _ [ fig .",
    "that is the system responds to the input .",
    "more precisely we can characterize sr as follow :    \\(1 ) the power spectrum of the response of a system to a periodic input has a main sharp peak at the input frequency @xmath3 _ if the noise strength ( or temperature ) is chosen properly_.    \\(2 ) the signal - to - noise ration ( snr ) of the response resonates _ at a certain noise strength ( or at a certain temperature)_.    besides the periodicity in the emergence of glacial ages @xcite , sr phenomenon are widely found in nature .",
    "for example sr is found in the nerve of the flagellum of a crayfish s tail @xcite ( however in this case , unlike the bistable system described above , a threshold reaction is triggered by noise ) . therefore sr may be a universal concept .    in this paper",
    "we discuss sr in bistable model _ at the quantum level _ , that is quantum stochastic resonance ( qsr ) .",
    "of course this effect has already been widely studied @xcite , however our particular interest is `` quantum noise , '' or `` quantum dynamics with dissipation . ''",
    "that is , we are interested in how noise is introduced into the quantum dynamics to produce qsr .",
    "this is not only important question for qsr , but it is also relevant for the understanding of several other fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics , that is the problems of relaxation , decoherence , measurement and so on .",
    "however quantum mechanics is usually written in terms of causal deterministic theory governed by unitary time evolution .",
    "it is therefore hard , in principle , to introduce the notion of `` noise '' or `` dissipation '' ( with finite degrees of freedom ) .    in these circumstances there",
    "are several different ways to proceed .",
    "one of the most popular approaches is to introduce an `` environment , ''  reservoir \" or `` heat bath , '' whose detailed specification one does not know but which has infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "the whole system ( _ i.e. _ @xmath4 ) is then treated in the quantum mechanical way @xcite .    through this interaction ,",
    "the system exchanges energy with the environment``dissipation'' , and then it is reasonable to assume that some kind of `` noise '' or `` fluctuation '' would appear due to some `` fluctuation - dissipation relation . ''",
    "along these lines accardi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have introduced the stochastic limit approximation ( sla ) as a way to realize `` quantum white noise . ''",
    "the sla is one way to deal with the van hove limit , which is the weak coupling limit given by , @xmath5 and time coarse - graining limit given by , @xmath6 .",
    "this limit ensures that a system in a heat bath approaches canonical state @xcite .    as is explicitly shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : sla ] for the spin - boson system , the spin system in the heat bath composed of bosons actually approaches the canonical state under the sla .",
    "furthermore , one can discuss important properties in quantum dissipative dynamics within this framework , such as the dependence on temperature of the shift in frequency of the system due to the interaction with the heat bath .",
    "we here focus our attention on the quantum white noise introduced through the sla , and study qsr as part of investigations of the properties of this noise . after the introduction of the model to be studied  the driven spin - boson system  in sec .",

    "if the tunneling amplitude between the two wells is sufficiently small , we are able to consider two `` localized '' states , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are approximately the ground states of left and right wells , respectively . taking the set of these states as the hilbert space basis",

    "note that the spin system and the boson system are coupled with the bilinear product of the spin operator @xmath23 and the boson operators .",
