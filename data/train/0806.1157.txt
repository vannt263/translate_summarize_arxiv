    "a significant fraction of @xmath0 collisions at the lhc will involve ( quasi - real ) photon interactions occurring at energies well beyond the electroweak energy scale  @xcite .",
    "the lhc can therefore be considered to some extend as a high - energy photon - proton collider . in a recent paper  @xcite , the initial comprehensive studies of high energy photon interactions at the lhc were reported . in the present contribution ,",
    "the selected results obtained in  @xcite are introduced and supplemented by new results .",
    "photon interactions can be studied thanks to the experimental signature of events involving photon exchanges : the presence of very forward scattered protons .    using the equivalent photon approximation ( epa )  @xcite , the @xmath0 cross sections of @xmath1 processes",
    "are obtained using the relative luminosity spectra @xmath2 :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the photon - parton cross section , @xmath5 is the luminosity spectra of the parton .",
    "processes as a function of the minimal photon - parton c.m.s . energy",
    "@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "cross sections have been evaluated using mg / me or calchep .",
    "for all jets , @xmath7  10  gev , @xmath8  5 and @xmath9  0.3 .",
    "no other cut than the regularisation cut @xmath10gev is applied on @xmath11    the luminosity and c.m.s .",
    "energy of photon - proton collisions are higher than the @xmath12 ones  @xcite .",
    "this offers interesting possibilities for the study of electroweak interactions and for searches beyond the standard model ( bsm ) up to tev scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : ovyn_fig1 ] shows direct photoproduction contribution at lo , evaluated using mg / me  @xcite or calchep  @xcite , as a function of the minimal photon - parton c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath6 .",
    "a large variety of @xmath13 processes has sizable cross section and could therefore be studied during the very low and low luminosity phases of lhc .",
    "interestingly , potentially dangerous standard model background processes with hard leptons , missing energy and jets coming from the production of gauge bosons , have cross sections only one or two orders of magnitude higher than those involving top quarks .",
    "photon - proton processes discussed in this paper involve topologies with hard jets in the final state . in order to take into account the effect of jet algorithms and the efficiency of event selection under realistic experimental conditions ,",
    "the generated events were passed : ( 1 ) to pythia 6.227  @xcite and ( 2 ) a fast simulation of a typical lhc multipurpose detector .",
    "this simulation assumes geometrical acceptance of sub - detectors and their finite energy resolutions .",
    "electrons and muons are reconstructed if they fall into the acceptance of the tracker ( @xmath14 ) and have a @xmath15  10  gev .",
    "jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm with @xmath16 and using the smeared particle momenta .",
    "the reconstructed jets are required to have a transverse momentum above 20  gev and @xmath17 .",
    "a jet is tagged as b - jet if its direction lies in the acceptance of the tracker and if it is associated to a parent b - quark .",
    "a b - tagging efficiency of 40@xmath18 is assumed . for c - jets and light quark / gluon jets , fake b - tagging efficiencies of 10@xmath18 and 1@xmath18",
    "respectively are assumed .",
    "@xmath19-jets are reconstructed with a typical efficiency of 60@xmath18 only if their @xmath20 is higher than 10  gev .",
    "tagging is essential for the extraction of high energy photon - induced interactions from the huge @xmath0 events .",
    "photon - induced interactions are characterised by a large pseudorapidity region completely devoid of any hadronic activity .",
    "this region is usually called _ large rapidity gap _ ( lrg ) .        during",
    "the phase of low luminosity ( i.e. significantly lower than @xmath21 @xmath22s@xmath23 ) , the _ event pile - up _ is negligible .",
    "thanks to the colour flow in @xmath0 interactions between the proton remnant and the hard hadronic final states , a simple way to suppress generic @xmath0 interactions is to require lrgs . the lrg condition can be applied using a cut based on the energy measured in the forward detector containing the minimum forward activity ( @xmath24 ) . for a maximal allowed energy of 50  gev , a typical reduction factor of 10@xmath25 and 10@xmath26 for a parton - parton @xmath27 and @xmath28 production",
    "respectively ( figure  [ fig : ovyn_fig2 ] ) is expected .",
    "this tagging technique , denoted as @xmath29 , is applied to all processes presented in the following sections with an upper cut at 50  gev .",
    "the advantage is that this cut can be done using the central detector only .",
    "however , as the energy of the escaping protons is not measured , the event kinematics is less constrained .",
    "a total integrated lhc luminosity of 1  fb@xmath23 without _ pile - up _ seems to be a realistic assumption .    in this paper",
    ", the only considered backgrounds come from photoproduction .",
    "however , potentially dangerous backgrounds arise when topologies similar to signal events are produced from the small fraction of parton - parton collisions containing rapidity gaps .",
    "the reduction factor due to lrgs might not be sufficient for several @xmath0 processes ( e.g. wj ) given their very large cross section .",
    "the rejection can be further improved by tightening the cut which defines the presence of a rapidity gap ( e.g. 30  gev instead of 50  gev ) and also by using other exclusivity conditions related for instance to the number of tracks .",
    "an exclusivity condition requiring no tracks , excluding isolated leptons and jet cones , with @xmath30  0.5  gev and 1  @xmath31  2.5 in the hemisphere where the rapidity gap is present is applied . with these newly defined acceptance cuts ,",
    "rapidity gap and exclusivity conditions , efficiency for signal processes drops roughly by a factor of two while the reduction factors for parton - parton reactions are better than @xmath32 ( see table [ tab : ovyn_tab1 ] ) .",
    ".cross - sections in fb before and after acceptance cuts corresponding to @xmath33 topology .",
    "@xmath34 is the cross section after @xmath29 , acceptance and exclusivity cuts . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ tab : ovyn_tab8 ]    the final state is composed of a @xmath35-jet and a @xmath36 boson .",
    "the studied topology is therefore @xmath37 .",
    "main irreducible background processes come from photoproduced @xmath28 and @xmath38 .",
    "after the application of acceptance cuts ( @xmath39  10  gev , @xmath40  20  gev , @xmath41 and b - tagging of the jet ) the cross sections obtained for the signal and for the irreducible backgrounds are similar ( table  [ tab : ovyn_tab8 ] ) . for the signal ,",
    "a value of 0.1 was chosen for @xmath42 while @xmath43 was set at zero .",
    "due to the large number of events produced and the signal to background ratio close to one , it appears that current limits on the anomalous couplings could be easily improved already after a few months of run of the lhc .",
    "a survey of several high energy @xmath44p interactions at lhc has been presented .",
    "the high cross section as well as the usually much lower backgrounds offers an ideal framework for studying massive electroweakly interacting particles in a complementary way to the usual , parton - parton processes .",
    "interesting studies and searches can already be performed at the initial integrated luminosity of about one inverse femtobarn .",
    "the @xmath45 photoproduction is also surprisingly large , offering an opportunity to measure @xmath46 element of the quark mixing matrix .",
    "anomalous @xmath47 couplings might also be uniquely revealed by photoproduction .",
    "larger integrated luminosity , of about hundred inverse femtobarn , will open complementary ways to access important information on the higgs boson coupling to @xmath35 quarks and @xmath36 bosons .",
