    "determining the properties of composite particles in relativistic field theories , such as mesons or baryons in qcd , is an essentially non  perturbative problem and is quite difficult to address from first principles .",
    "while impressive progress has been made in numerical approaches to the problem@xcite , it is highly desirable to also have a more analytic understanding of the properties of the composite particles .",
    "an important relation that can be applied to composite particles in vector like theories , like massive qcd , are the mass inequality relations @xcite .",
    "while these elegant inequalities are quite useful and have therefore been well studied ( for a recent review , see , @xcite ) , there seems to be little understanding regarding their quantitative behavior .",
    "furthermore , while the proof of inequalities does not apply to chiral , explicitly left ",
    "right asymmetric theories or theories with yukawa couplings , no examples of theories wherein the inequality has been shown to be negative exists amongst relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "the mass inequalities provide non - trivial insight into the dynamics of the interacting model .",
    "an understanding of the behavior of the inequalities will undoubtedly further our understanding of the spectrum of bound states in relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "whether the inequalities might or might not be positive in chiral models is of import , in particular to supersymmetric theories . in supersymmetric theories , one often ` solves ' the gauge hierarchy problem by invoking the chiral symmetry of the fermions , which is related in turn to the mass of the scalar bosons by supersymmetry .",
    "while some non  perturbative aspects of supersymmetric gauge theories are recently being clarified@xcite , relations analogous to the mass inequality relations seems not to be known .",
    "such relations , if they exist , should shed light on the properties of the spectrum on supersymmetric theories and on the possibility of spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry . in attempting to extend the mass inequalities to supersymmetric theories",
    ", we believe a deeper understanding of its properties to be crucial . of course , non - supersymmetric theories are of interest on its own , one of the reasons being that the low energy world is not supersymmetric .    while , needless to say , computing the mass inequalities in full qcd would be of import , not to mention very interesting , this is a daunting task .",
    "one approach is to compute the mass inequalities and develop an understanding of their behavior in analytically solvable relativistic quantum field theory models , such as the classic t  hooft model@xcite and the gross  neveu models@xcite .",
    "this is the approach we shall adopt in this work .",
    "these models are tractable yet non  trivial and have proven to be quite instructive by providing physics insight into the non - perturbative aspects of field theories@xcite .",
    "dynamics of gauge theories is certainly of import especially since it is an integral part of the standard model .",
    "also , theories of four fermi interactions have been serving an important role in particle physics and other fields of physics@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall analyze the properties of mass inequalities of gauged four fermi models in @xmath1dimensions , using the large @xmath0 limit . in these models ,",
    "the properties of the `` meson '' states can be reduced analytically to the problem of solving mathematical equations@xcite .",
    "this will allow us to study the problem analytically , even if the final equations need to be solved numerically .",
    "the parameters in this family of models which we can arbitrary control are the scalar and the pseudo - scalar four fermi couplings , the gauge coupling and the `` quark '' masses .",
    "the class of models we study contains the t  hooft model@xcite and the chiral and non  chiral gross ",
    "neveu models@xcite for particular choices of the parameters .",
    "it includes cases where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously or explicitly broken .",
    "this is of particular interest , since the gross  neveu model is known to be equivalent to a yukawa model where the scalar field develops an expectation value@xcite .",
    "this is precisely the kind of situation where one might suspect that the mass inequality may be violated@xcite .    in order to study the mass inequalities quantitatively and systematically , we need a measure for the size of the inequality .",
    "we shall find such a measure in a parameter which we shall call the ` meson mass susceptibility ' to be explained below .",
    "this parameter will allow us to compare the inequalities of various field theories in a natural manner .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : susc ] , we shall define and explain the meson mass susceptibility .",
    "in section  [ sec : qm ] , we discuss mass inequalities in quantum mechanics . in section  [ sec : gn ] , we first treat the simpler case of generalized gross  neveu models and analyze the mass inequalities there .",
    "in particular , an analytic form of the mass susceptibility will be explicitly presented . in section  [ sec :",
    "tgn ] , we work with the general gauged four fermi models .",
    "we first summarize the class of models we study and explain how the meson spectrum can be computed .",
    "particular care has been paid to presenting the methods we use explicitly for further possible use .",
    "we then compute and study the properties of the mass differences .",
    "we end with discussions of the results in section  [ sec : discussions ] . a short appendix on some of the technical aspects of the computation",
    "is included .",
    "in studying the mass inequalities quantitatively , we need a quantitative measure of how `` large '' the inequality is , in order to compare within the field theory space . this encodes information , intuitively speaking , on how strong the attractive interactions in the theory are .",
    "the mass inequality we consider is @xmath2 which is known to be positive for vector - like gauge theories@xcite . here , denoting the constituents as @xmath3 s",
    ", @xmath4 is the mass of the lightest meson that overlaps with the @xmath5 state , and so on .",
    "this quantity is dimensionful and depends not only on the model , but also on the difference of the masses of the constituents .",
    "the quantity may be made dimensionless trivially by taking the ratio of the inequality with a meson mass .",
    "however , this inequality may become large just because the constituent mass difference is large , so is not the most appropriate parameter for investigating the intrinsic dynamics of the theory .",
    "in fact , if we consider the field theory space to be parameterized by the couplings of the model which include the masses , the mass inequality is _ not _ a local quantity in the parameter space .",
    "it is more natural to define a local parameter in the field theory space .",
    "let us define the mass squared of the constituents to be @xmath6 the meson mass difference @xmath7 is even under the interchange of @xmath8 and @xmath9 and is therefore an even function of @xmath10 .",
    "we shall characterize the inequality by a parameter we refer to as the `` meson mass susceptibility '' .",
    "this quantity is defined by , @xmath11 which is a function of the couplings and the mass of the constituent quark .",
    "the susceptibility we defined above is also useful from a practical point of view : since the mass inequality is an expansion in the mass difference squared , the susceptibility together with the meson mass for equal mass quarks , distill the meson mass information when the quark mass difference is not too large .",
    "we should perhaps here discuss the relation of this susceptibility to the global properties of the mass inequality , namely when the mass differences are arbitrary .",
    "a natural question is whether the positivity of the susceptibility in a parameter region guarantees the positivity of the inequality when the mass differences are large . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the situation is quite simple ; if the susceptibility is positive everywhere , the mass inequality is positive for arbitrary mass differences .",
    "this can be derived from the convexity of the meson mass with respect to the reduced mass of the two quarks . in quantum field theory , however , no such argument exists in general , since the meson mass needs not and will not depend only on the reduced mass of the two quarks . to make an analogous argument in quantum field theory",
    ", we need further information regarding the relation between the meson mass and the quark masses .",
    "while it seems quite natural to assume that relations exist such that the positivity of the local susceptibility guarantees the positivity of the mass inequality globally , we do not know if this is in fact true . in practice",
    ", we have found no counterexamples to this statement .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss mass inequalities in quantum mechanics ( see also @xcite ) . while the discussion is not necessary for computing mass inequalities in relativistic field theories , we feel that it is nonetheless quite instructive and provides a broader perspective on mass inequalities in quantum theories .",
    "also , the mass inequalities in relativistic field theories should reduce to that of quantum mechanics in the non  relativistic limit . as such ,",
    "some of the results here will be later compared to those from the full quantum field theory below .",
    "it should be noted , however , that phenomena such as symmetry breaking which plays a large role in @xmath1dimensional gauge theories studied in this work are essentially quantum field theoretical so that quantum mechanical behavior is not sufficient for understanding the full relativistic behavior , even qualitatively .    in quantum mechanics",
    ", the problem of two body bound states under a local potential reduces to a model with the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the reduced mass , @xmath14 .",
    "we will analyze one dimensional models , but similar analysis can be applied to higher dimensional models .",

    "@xmath27 needs to be imposed for the existence of bound states . @xmath28 and @xmath29 corresponds to the harmonic oscillator and the three dimensional coulomb case , respectively .    we can use the uncertainty principle to crudely estimate the bound state energy as @xmath30 we can obtain the susceptibility from this energy as @xmath31 in the non  relativistic limit .",
    "while the derivation is not rigorous , in the harmonic oscillator and the coulomb cases , the susceptibilities agrees with those obtained from exact methods .",
    "in this section , we analyze the mass inequalities in the generalized gross  neveu models , described by the lagrangian @xmath32 in addition to the flavor indices @xmath33 denoted explicitly in the above formula , the fermions carry an additional internal space index , the ` color ' index ( @xmath34 ) which has been suppressed in the notation .",
    "this index should not be confused with the flavor index .",
    "we take the large @xmath0 limit while keeping @xmath35 fixed .",
    "when @xmath36 , the model reduces to the original gross  neveu model and when @xmath37 , the model reduces to the chiral gross  neveu model with continuous chiral symmetry .",

    "the physical parameters of this quantum field theory are the two dimensionless renormalized couplings @xmath54 and the mass ratio @xmath56 .    before we analyze the behavior of the mass inequalities , we first need to understand the behavior of the spectrum when the masses of the constituents are the same . in this case , the secular equation splits into two independent equations for the pseudo  scalar and scalar bound states , @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath59 it should be noted that only @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) appears in the equation for @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",

    "however , for small @xmath120 , the convergence is rather slow . particularly intriguing",
    "is the region @xmath135 .",
    "a simple argument shows why the behavior in this region can be subtle : in general , the finite dimensional numerical results are analytic with respect to the parameters @xmath136 . from the behavior",
    "@xmath137 as @xmath138 , we know that unless @xmath121 vanishes as @xmath139 or some higher even power for @xmath130 , there will be a region where @xmath121 is negative . indeed , we find in the numerical results that @xmath121 is negative in the region @xmath140 using both the variational and the multhopp s method .",
    "even the extrapolated values , in some cases , are negative .",
    "the meson mass squared is always positive even in these cases and the physics of the system seems to be quite consistent .",
    "naively , we would claim that the susceptibility and hence also the mass inequality is negative in this regime .",
    "this , to our knowledge , would _ not _ conflict with any general arguments regarding mass inequalities .",
    "however , to conclude this would be somewhat premature , since if we study the negative region in the parameter space , we find as in that it shrinks when the basis space is enlarged and the negative region is quite small compared to @xmath141 which is the natural scale in the problem . it should also be noted that even if @xmath142 for @xmath130 when the basis space is finite , it is still possible that the coefficient @xmath143 approaches @xmath144 in the full basis space , so that the positive susceptibility is compatible with a negative one in the truncated basis space . on the other hand , the regions of negative susceptibility have a common region with respect to both methods so it is also possible that a finite region of negative susceptibility remains even when the basis space is complete .",
    "we therefore conclude that while the susceptibility may be negative in the regime @xmath140 , further investigation is necessary to clarify this point .",
    "an analytic computation determining the sign of the inequality would be ideal .",
    "if this is not possible , a set of basis optimized for the gauged four fermi models in this particular parameter regime , in either variational or multhopp s method should settle this issue .",
    "we have systematically and quantitatively studied the mass inequalities in gauged four fermi models in @xmath1dimensions . even in the cases where",
    "the mass inequality has been shown to be positive from general arguments , the size of the inequality is unknown unless an explicit computation is made .",
    "we believe that the mass inequality is an interesting dynamical quantity characterizing the spectrum of relativistic quantum field theories . to analyze the inequalities quantitatively",
    ", we adopted a natural susceptibility parameter to compare the size of the inequalities throughout the field theory space .",
    "we found that the parameter captures the essence of the mass inequality when the constituent mass differences are not too large . in the family of generalized gross ",
    "neveu models , we were able to derive an analytic expression for the meson mass susceptibility . in the more general case of gauged four fermi models ,",
    "we have developed methods for obtaining the mass inequalities systematically and have computed them . since not much seems to be known about the quantitative behavior of mass inequalities , we think that it is significant to have a class of relativistic field theory models where it has been studied explicitly . while the results are interesting , there remain further questions which should be answered .",
    "an important question is whether the positivity of the mass inequality is much more general than the cases where it has been shown to hold @xcite . in particular , an intriguing problem is whether there is a relativistic quantum field theory wherein the mass inequality is negative yet its physics behavior is consistent .",
    "we have found that the meson mass susceptibility is positive for most of the parameter space in the gauged four fermi models and have explained some of the behavior analytically .",
    "the models we studied here include the celebrated models of t  hooft and of gross and neveu for special choices of the parameters .",
    "for the t  hooft model , the standard arguments@xcite _ do _ apply and we may show analytically that the inequality is positive . however , in general , no such arguments can be applied to gauged four fermi models .",
    "furthermore , the gross  neveu models are known to be equivalent to models with yukawa couplings and also display dynamical chiral symmetry breaking behavior .",
    "these are exactly the kind of situations in which we might doubt that the mass inequality is positive@xcite .",
    "it is interesting that even in these cases , the mass inequality is positive , so that in fact , the property holds in much more general than those situations where it has been proven",
    ". it would be interesting to find an analytic proof for this property if possible .",
    "it is important to understand why the inequality is positive for the gauged four fermi models and clarify if this can be extended to other theories , such as supersymmetric theories with bound states .",
    "there still remains a small region within the field theory space wherein the sign of the susceptibility , hence also the mass inequality , remains uncertain and further investigation is necessary to establish its sign . while @xmath1dimensional theories such as the t  hooft model or the gross - neveu model have physical behavior resembling those of higher dimensions , we should mention the possibility that in higher dimensions , the behavior of the susceptibility might be quite different .",
    "also , even in @xmath1dimensions , the mass inequalities might behave qualitatively differently for other class of models .",
    "we have seen in section  [ sec : qm ] that the mass inequality is satisfied in a large class of quantum mechanics models@xcite .",
    "this leads us to suspect that the mass inequality is valid for a large class of relativistic quantum field theories also .",
    "this is certainly consistent with our findings here .",
    "however , it should be noted that spontaneous breaking of symmetries is essentially a field theoretical behavior , which is also quite relevant to the theory we studied .",
    "therefore , we believe that it would be worthwhile to perform further research and in particular , clarify whether the mass inequality can become negative in relativistic quantum field theories . in another direction , large @xmath0 limit of field theories , such as the class of models we study , are presumably described by some kind of string theories@xcite  an idea , which has recently been made more concrete@xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to find out what kind of string theories our models correspond to and to elucidate how mass inequalities fit into the string picture .",
    "here , we shall briefly outline how to perform perturbation with respect to the relative constituent mass difference , @xmath10 , in the methods explained in section  [ sec : tgn - spectrum ] for obtaining the spectrum .",
    "the standard perturbation methods can not be applied here .",
    "one major reason is that the boundary conditions depend on the masses of the constituents so that they need to be perturbed also .",
    "there are additional complications for both the methods used in section  [ sec : tgn - spectrum ] , as we shall describe below .    in both cases ,",
    "we perturb in the relative mass difference @xmath10 and obtain an expansion for the meson mass in terms of @xmath10 , for the cases @xmath145 . @xmath146 in the first two cases , the first order term exists and are of the same size but of opposite sign and in the last case the first order term is absent . therefore , the leading order term in the mass difference @xmath7 will be of order @xmath147 , as it should be .      in the variational method",
    ", we need to consider a generalized eigenvalue problem with the normalization matrix not being the identity matrix . in theory",
    ", we can just orthonormalize the basis vectors , but in practice , this is not numerically equivalent since the normalization matrices can become almost singular even though we have tried to normalize the matrix elements to be of order one . furthermore , since the boundary conditions also are perturbed , the normalization matrices will also have a non  trivial expansion in @xmath10 .",
    "let us expand the matrices as @xmath148 assume that we have the complete eigen system for the 0th order problem : @xmath149 then , we obtain the expansion for mass squared of the meson state labeled by @xmath150 @xmath151 we need the expansions of the matrices @xmath152 in terms of @xmath10 for the three cases , @xmath145 , to obtain the final results .",
    "since this expansion is cumbersome but logically straightforward , it will not be explicitly presented here to save space .      in multhopp",
    "s method , the matrices are not hermitean so that we need to perform the perturbation theory with some care .",
    "furthermore , due to the perturbation in the boundary conditions , the matrix @xmath153 will also be perturbed . to perform the expansion",
    ", we will reduce the equation to a mathematically equivalent problem , @xmath154 ideally , it is better not to invert matrices numerically , but it is a substantially more complicated numerical task to solve a generalized non ",
    "symmetric eigenvalue problem and also , in this case , the matrix @xmath153 turns out to be quite robust against inversion even for moderately large basis spaces with dimensions of order @xmath155 .",
    "we need to first solve the @xmath144th order problem for the left and right eigenvectors , @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xmath160 then , we may obtain the expansion for the meson mass squared of the meson state labeled by @xmath150 as @xmath161 the rest proceeds as in the variational method case .",
    "as in the case of the variational method , the explicit expressions for the matrices are not shown here due to space considerations .",
