    "polarization of starlight by aligned interstellar dust grains was discovered nearly half a century ago ( hiltner 1949a , b ; hall 1949 ; hall & mikesell 1949 ) , but the processes responsible for the observed alignment remain uncertain .",
    "davis & greenstein ( 1951 ) observed that interstellar grains were expected to be rotating rapidly due to brownian motion , and proposed that these spinning grains could be aligned with the local magnetic field by paramagnetic dissipation .",
    "however , further study of the statistical mechanics of grain alignment ( jones & spitzer 1967 ; purcell & spitzer 1971 ) raised questions about the ability of the interstellar magnetic field to achieve the observed degree of alignment , since random gas - grain collisions would tend to oppose the alignment process .",
    "purcell ( 1975 , 1979 ) first recognized that interstellar grains were expected to have superthermal rotational velocities as the result of systematic torques , the most important of which appeared to be due to the process of @xmath0 formation on the grain surface .",
    "as discussed by purcell , superthermal rotation due to torques which are fixed in body coordinates can enhance the degree of grain alignment , since the `` thermal '' torques due to random collisions with gas atoms now have little effect on the direction of the grain angular momentum , allowing paramagnetic dissipation to inexorably bring the angular momentum into alignment with the galactic field .",
    "the systematic torques considered by purcell were due to processes taking place at the grain surface ",
    "@xmath0 formation , photoelectric emission , and inelastic collisions with gas atoms  but the grain surface may be altered due to contamination or erosion on relatively short time scales .",
    "the resulting changes in direction of the systematic torque can cause the grain to occasionally undergo short periods when its rotation is `` spun down '' ; during these `` crossover '' episodes the grain may become disaligned ( spitzer & mcglynn 1979 ) . because of this disorientation during `` crossover '' , it was not clear whether ordinary paramagnetic dissipation plus superthermal rotation driven by `` purcell torques '' can account for the observed grain alignment .",
    "in addition , dust grains were observed to be aligned in some dense molecular regions where `` purcell torques '' were expected to be ineffective due to a low h / h@xmath7 ratio , attenuation of the ultraviolet radiation required for photoelectric emission , and near - equality of gas and grain temperatures . as a result , there has been renewed interest in alternatives , including the possibility that grains may be superparamagnetic ( jones & spitzer 1967 ; duley 1978 ; martin 1995 ; goodman & whittet 1995 ) , or that grain alignment is due to gas - grain streaming ( gold 1952 ; lazarian 1994 , 1995a ; roberge , hanany , & messinger 1995 ) .",
    "lazarian ( 1995b ) has emphasized the possible importance of grain `` helicity '' , since helical grains can be driven to superthermal rotational velocities , and possibly aligned , when exposed to either streaming gas atoms or anisotropic radiation .",
    "harwit ( 1970a , b ) suggested that the quantized angular momentum of the photon could lead to rapid rotation of a grain following absorption and emission of many photons , and proposed that the anisotropy of starlight could result in a tendency for interstellar grains to spin with their angular momentum vectors parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "dolginov ( 1972 ) observed that interstellar grains might have different absorption and scattering cross sections for left- and right - handed circularly polarized light , so that the grain angular momentum could be changed if illuminated by unpolarized but anisotropic radiation .",
    "this effect was further discussed by dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) for particles in the rayleigh limit , and by dolginov & silantev ( 1976 ) for larger particles but with refractive index close to unity so that the rayleigh - gans approximation could be used .",
    "dolginov & mytrophanov noted that this process could lead to both rapid rotation and possible alignment .",
    "unfortunately , dolginov and collaborators were unable to calculate the torques on grains with realistic compositions and sizes .",
    "that irregular interstellar grains should be subject to radiative torques is not surprising .",
    "we consider two macroscopic examples for illustration .",
    "[ fig : targs]a shows a four - fold symmetric target with square top and bottom , with each of its four rectangular sides divided into perfectly absorbing and perfectly reflecting halves .",
    "in the geometric optics limit the normal component of the radiation pressure force will be twice as large on the reflecting sections as on the absorbing sections ; as a result , an isotropic radiation field illuminating this target will produce a positive torque along axis @xmath8 . however , incident radiation which is either parallel or antiparallel to @xmath8 will not produce any torque on this target . fig .",
    "[ fig : targs]b shows a target obtained by starting with the shape of fig.[fig : targs]a and removing four wedges from the top and four from the bottom , with the resulting shape being symmetric under reflection through the centroid .",
    "fig.[fig : targs]b is an example of a shape with `` helicity '' . from symmetry it is clear that an isotropic radiation field will produce no torque on this target : whatever torque is exerted on the `` top '' half of the grain will be cancelled by an opposite torque on the `` bottom '' half .",
    "however , anisotropic illumination can produce a torque on this target .",
    "if , for example , the surfaces are all perfectly reflecting , then incident radiation which is antiparallel to @xmath8 will produce a torque parallel to @xmath8 , while radiation parallel to @xmath8 will produce a torque antiparallel to @xmath8 .",
    "these two examples show that macroscopic objects will be subject to radiative torques unless they are highly symmetric ; thus irregular targets should generally be subject to radiative torques .",
    "interstellar grains are , of course , comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of the illuminating radiation , but one does not expect the radiative torques to vanish when target geometries such as fig .",
    "[ fig : targs ] are reduced to sizes comparable to the wavelength .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the forces and torques on grains of arbitrary shape and with sizes which are neither large nor small compared to the wavelength of the incident radiation .",
    "we show how these forces and torques can be calculated using the discrete dipole approximation .",
    "quantitative results are obtained for one particular irregular grain shape .    the first part of this paper ,   [ sec : dda]-[sec : target_orient ] , is devoted to development of the theory of scattering by irregular particles to enable efficient computation of radiative torques .",
    "this is carried out within the conceptual ( and computational ) framework of the discrete dipole approximation . in  [ sec : dda_results ] we report results of extensive computations for one specific irregular grain geometry and composition , and three different sizes , @xmath9 , 0.05 , and @xmath10 ( @xmath2 is the radius of a sphere of equal volume ) .    readers primarily interested in the implications for grain rotation may elect to skip   [ sec : dda]-[sec : dda_results ] , and proceed directly to  [ sec : interstellar ] , where we discuss the effects of starlight and gas drag under realistic conditions in interstellar diffuse clouds , and ",
    "[ sec : superthermal ] , where the resulting superthermal rotation is evaluated .",
    "it is seen in  [ sec : diffuse ] that moderately anisotropic starlight can torque @xmath3 grains in diffuse clouds up to extremely large rotational velocities , exceeding even the superthermal rotation due to @xmath0 formation .",
    "smaller ( @xmath11 ) grains , on the other hand , are only weakly affected by radiative torques .",
    "we also examine the importance of radiative torques within quiescent dark clouds (  [ sec : dark ] ) , and within active star - forming regions (  [ sec : starforming ] ) .",
    "our results are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our principal result is that the torques exerted on interstellar grains by background starlight are dynamically very important for grains with @xmath5",
    ". these torques will produce extreme superthermal rotation of interstellar grains in both diffuse clouds and star - forming clouds . in a separate paper ( draine & weingartner 1996 )",
    "we examine the role of these radiative torques in the alignment of interstellar grains with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "we adopt the `` discrete dipole approximation '' ( draine & flatau 1994 ) , and represent the target by an array of polarizable points , at locations @xmath12 , with electric polarizabilities @xmath13 .",
    "the space between the points is vacuum .",

    "lazarian ( 1995c ) argued that @xmath0 formation on fractal grains would only be able to drive grains with @xmath233 to superthermal rotation .",
    "as pointed out by purcell ( 1975 , 1979 ) , superthermal rotation contributes to grain alignment by rendering unimportant the disaligning effects of random collisions with gas atoms .",
    "purcell considered three processes which could drive grains to superthermal rotation : @xmath0 formation on the grain surface , photoelectric emission , and variations in the effective accomodation coefficient over the grain surface ; of the three , @xmath0 formation appears to be the most powerful . as discussed in ",

    "the three processes discussed by purcell depend upon surface properties ; if the grain surface is altered on a relatively short time scale , then substantial grain alignment will not occur unless the grains are superparamagnetic ( in which case @xmath238 is short ) .    here",
    "we propose another mechanism for selective alignment of the larger grains .",
    "the radiative torques on the grain depend upon the global geometry of the grain , and will therefore have a correlation time of order the grain lifetime , @xmath239 . for the @xmath3 grains considered here , @xmath240 , and we may expect long - lived superthermal rotation . by itself",
    ", long - lived superthermal rotation would lead to grain alignment by paramagnetic dissipation on the davis - greenstein timescale @xmath1 , as expected for `` purcell torques '' which are fixed in body coordinates .",
    "however , when an anisotropic radiation field is present , the radiative torque components perpendicular to @xmath8 may act directly to change the grain alignment on time scales short compared to @xmath1 ; it appears that this may be the mechanism responsible for the observed alignment of @xmath5 dust grains with the interstellar magnetic field ( draine & weingartner 1996 ) .    for the @xmath118 grains , on the other hand , the radiative torques are weak compared to the purcell torques due to @xmath0 formation .",
    "if the surface site lifetime @xmath241 , there will be frequent crossover events , with a resulting low degree of grain alignment .",

    "the dynamics of grain alignment including radiative torques will be examined in more detail in a later paper ( draine & weingartner 1996 ) .",

    "recent studies of polarization of background stars indicate a low degree of grain alignment in the central regions of some dark clouds ( goodman et al .",

    "we see that the weakened radiation field , and the higher gas density , make the radiative torques relatively unimportant in this environment . near the cloud surface , of course , conditions are closer to the diffuse cloud conditions of table [ tab : diffuse ] , and radiative torques will maintain superthermal rotation .",
    "thus we expect grain alignment near the cloud surface , but not at depths @xmath257mag .      in star - forming clouds , there are obviously sources of starlight within the clouds . to estimate the characteristic starlight energy density to which the fir - emitting dust is exposed , we note that for grains with far - infrared emissivity @xmath258 , the power radiated by the grain @xmath259 , where @xmath189 is the grain temperature .",

    "while the spectrum no doubt differs from the isrf spectrum , it is not obvious how : the embedded massive stars will tend to be bluer , but the spectrum will be reddened by propagation through the dust . for the present purposes , we will assume the isrf spectrum , with an anisotropy factor @xmath273 .",

    "the superthermal rotation is expected to be very long - lived , since it depends upon global properties of the grain , rather than the relatively short - lived surface properties which determine superthermal rotation due to @xmath0 formation , photoelectric emission , or variations in surface accomodation coefficient .",

    "this may explain why @xmath5 grains in diffuse clouds are aligned , while there is evidently minimal alignment of the @xmath6 grains which dominate the extreme ultraviolet extinction .",
    "radiative torques appear to be able to drive grains to superthermal rotation in star - forming regions , such as m17 , where the ratio of anisotropic radiation to gas pressure is relatively high , thereby potentially explaining the observed alignment of far - infrared emitting dust in m17 and other star - forming regions with warm dust . in cold dark clouds , on the other hand , radiative torques are unable to drive the grains to superthermal rotation , consistent with the observed lack of aligned grains deep in quiescent dark clouds .",
