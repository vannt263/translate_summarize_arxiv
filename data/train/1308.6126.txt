    "methods of maximizing entropies have a long tradition . typically , partial information is available , and a unique inference is desired , in terms of a probability distribution describing the state of a system under observation .",
    "the universality of entropy methods is a controversial topic , but from the perspective of the present article , it makes the question interesting why some sets of observables are distinguished through the discontinuity of an entropic inference method .",
    "another important question is whether such observables can be implemented in physical experiments .",
    "we have no answers to both questions . in this article",
    "we describe a condition of continuity which will certainly be helpful to find more examples theoretically . we stress that this discussion takes place in a finite - dimensional matrix algebra , where entropy functionals are continuous .",
    "the shannon and von neumann entropies will not be considered in infinite settings @xcite .",
    "let us dwell upon the idea of universality .",
    "the maximization of the shannon entropy under linear constraints dates back to 1877 with boltzmann s work about the energy distribution of a particle in a gas .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "jaynes @xcite argued that the axioms of the shannon entropy prove that the method of maximizing entropy is the least biased inference possible if partial information is available .",
    "shore and johnson @xcite moved on to axiomatize not the entropy but the inference under partial information , leading to the method , later termed _ me _ , of minimizing the kullback - leibler divergence under the constraint of partial information , relative to a prior probability distribution describing the state of the system . later on",
    "skilling @xcite argued that me is a universal method of updating a probability distribution ( or a positive distribution ) given new information in terms of a constraint .",
    "the universality comes from the idea of _ induction _ in the philosophical sense , that is , finding a theory or a general rule from examples .",
    "see also @xcite and see csiszr @xcite for axioms of me under linear constraints , where continuity is postulated ( for distributions of full support ) .",
    "critics of the universality of me claim that a ( relative ) _ renyi - entropy _ should be minimized in inference @xcite and that the entropy function depends on a choice of properties that should be preserved during updating the prior @xcite .",
    "a counterattack against the renyi - entropies is @xcite .",
    "the universality of me is doubted in particular outside of physics where the wide range of mathematical results about the shannon entropy , from coding theorems over data compression and much more , _ `` provide a rationale , as well as several caveats , to the maximum entropy principle '' _ @xcite .",
    "the kullback - leibler divergence generalizes some mathematical properties of the shannon entropy , like a game theoretical aspect @xcite or a data compression property @xcite .",
    "after all , maximum - entropy methods have a wide range of applications , as documented for example in the conference proceedings of _ maximum entropy and bayesian methods _ , which make their analysis important .",
    "von neumann @xcite has applied for the first time maximum - entropy methods to quantum system .",
    "the quantum analogue of me uses the umegaki relative entropy @xcite .",
    "although ochs , ohya and petz @xcite have given axioms for the von neumann entropy and the umegaki relative entropy , no axioms of the inference are known which would lead to the quantum me . however , several justifications of the quantum me are known @xcite and a few references to applications are collected in @xcite .",
    "let us turn to a more detailed characteristics of the discontinuities in question .",
    "given a fixed set of observables and a prior state , the ( quantum ) me - inference is , in a suitable restriction , a real - analytic map .",
    "this restriction has a continuous extension for mutually commuting observables , as was shown by barndorff - nielsen @xcite , p.  154",
    ", for the case of probability distributions .",
    "so the discontinuities are a pure quantum phenomenon , like for example entanglement .",
    "we @xcite have found a pair of non - commutative observables of a three - level quantum system , where this continuous extension is not possible and we @xcite stress that    1 .",
    "discontinuities are not removable by changing single values of the me - inference , 2 .",
    "if the true state of the quantum system has full support then the discontinuities have no consequences in asymptotic state estimation , except possibly about the convergence rate , 3 .",
    "the continuity of the inference map is characterized by the openness of the restricted linear map assigning expected values to the ( fixed ) observables , 4 .",
    "the openness condition has the physical interpretation of tolerance of an me - inference state for small ambiguity of expected values .    in the following",
    "we will explain these statements .",
    "we define the me - inference .",
    "we show why discontinuities of the me - inference are not removable and we address the asymptotic state estimation .",

    "there is no need to evaluate @xmath40 on the boundary of @xmath47 , where all its discontinuities lie .",

    "if @xmath28 has full support , that is @xmath28 is invertible as a linear map , then the expected value @xmath27 lies in @xmath46 , see for example @xcite .",
