    "in @xcite , fomin and zelevinsky prove that for all positive integers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the sequence of rational functions @xmath8",
    "( @xmath9 ) satisfying the `` @xmath0-recurrence '' @xmath10 is a sequence of laurent polynomial in the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; that is , for all @xmath13 , @xmath8 can be written as a sum of laurent monomials of the form @xmath14 , where the coefficient @xmath15 is an integer and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are ( not necessarily positive ) integers .",
    "in fact , fomin and zelevinsky conjecture that the coefficients are always _ positive _ integers .    it is worth mentioning that variants of this recurrence typically lead to rational functions that are not laurent polynomials .",
    "for instance , if one initializes with @xmath18 and defines rational functions @xmath19 with @xmath20 all integers larger than 1 , then it appears that @xmath21 is not a laurent polynomial ( in @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) unless @xmath22 and that @xmath23 is not a laurent polynomial unless @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "( this has been checked by computer in the cases where @xmath20 are all between 2 and 5 . )",
    "one reason for studying @xmath0-recurrences is their relationship with root systems associated to rank two kac - moody lie algebras .",
    "furthermore , algebras generated by a sequence of elements satisfying a @xmath0-recurrence provide examples of rank two cluster algebras , as defined in @xcite by fomin and zelevinsky .",
    "the property of being a sequence of laurent polynomials , _ laurentness _ , is in fact proven for all cluster algebras @xcite as well as a class of examples going beyond cluster algebras @xcite . in this context",
    ", the positivity of the coefficients is no mere curiosity , but is related to important ( albeit still conjectural ) total - positivity properties of dual canonical bases @xcite .",
    "the cases @xmath2 correspond to finite - dimensional lie algebras ( that is , semisimple lie algebras ) , and these cases have been treated in great detail by fomin and zelevinsky @xcite . for example , the cases @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 correspond respectively to the lie algebras @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . in these cases ,",
    "the sequence of laurent polynomials @xmath8 is periodic .",
    "more specifically , the sequence repeats with period 5 when @xmath31 , with period 6 when @xmath32 or @xmath33 , and with period 8 when @xmath34 or @xmath35 . for each of these cases , one can check that each @xmath8 has positive integer coefficients .",
    "very little is known about the cases @xmath4 , which should correspond to kac - moody lie algebras of general type .",
    "it can be shown that for these cases , the sequence of laurent polynomials @xmath8 is non - periodic .",
    "this article gives a combinatorial approach to the intermediate cases @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , corresponding to kac - moody lie algebras of affine type ; specifically algebras of types @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "work of sherman and zelevinsky @xcite has also focused on the rank two affine case .",
    "in fact , they are able to prove positivity of the @xmath36- , @xmath37- and @xmath38-cases , as well as a complete description of the positive cone .",
    "they prove both cases simultaneously by utilizing a more general recurrence which specializes to either case . by using newton polygons , root systems and algebraic methods analogous to those used in the finite type case @xcite , they are able to construct the dual canonical bases for these cluster algebras explicitly .",
    "our method is intended as a complement to the purely algebraic method of sherman and zelevinsky @xcite . in each of the cases @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 we show that the positivity conjecture of fomin and zelevinsky is true by providing ( and proving ) a combinatorial interpretation of all the coefficients of @xmath8 .",
    "that is , we show that the coefficient of @xmath41 in @xmath8 is actually the cardinality of a certain set of combinatorial objects , namely , the set of those perfect matchings of a particular graph that contain a specified number of `` @xmath11-edges '' and a specified number of `` @xmath12-edges '' .",
    "this combinatorial description provides a different way of understanding the cluster variables , one where the binomial exchange relations are visible geometrically .",
    "the reader may already have guessed that the cases @xmath37 and @xmath38 are closely related .",
    "one way to think about this relationship is to observe that the formulas @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be re - written as @xmath44 and @xmath45 these give us a canonical way of recursively defining rational functions @xmath8 with @xmath46 , and indeed , it is not hard to show that @xmath47 so the @xmath38 sequence of laurent polynomials can be obtained from the @xmath37 sequence of laurent polynomials by running the recurrence in reverse and switching the roles of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . henceforth we will not consider the @xmath38 recurrence ; instead , we will study the @xmath37 recurrence and examine @xmath8 for all integer values of @xmath48 , the negative together with the positive .",
    "our approach to the @xmath37 case will be the same as our approach to the simpler @xmath36 case : in both cases , we will utilize perfect matchings of graphs as studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* et al . ) .",
    "for a graph @xmath49 , which has an assignment of weights @xmath50 to its edges @xmath51 , a _ perfect matching _ of @xmath52 is a subset @xmath53 of the edges of @xmath52 such that each vertex @xmath54 belongs to exactly one edge in @xmath55 .",
    "we define the _ weight _ of a perfect matching @xmath55 to be the product of the weights of its constituent edges , @xmath56    with this definition in mind , the main result of this paper is the construction of a family of graphs @xmath57 indexed by @xmath58 with weights on their edges such that the terms of the @xmath36- ( resp .",
    "@xmath37- ) recurrence , @xmath8 , satisfy @xmath59 ; where @xmath60 is the polynomial @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the monomial @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 characterize the @xmath3-skeleton of @xmath66 .",
    "these constructions appear as theorem [ 22thm ] and theorem [ 14thm ] in sections 2 and 3 , for the @xmath36- and @xmath37- cases , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath60 may be considered a two - variable generating function for the perfect matchings of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 may be considered a generating function as well , with a slightly different definition of the weight that includes `` global '' factors ( associated with the structure of @xmath66 ) as well as `` local '' factors ( associated with the edges of a particular perfect matching ) .",
    "we note that the families @xmath66 with @xmath68 and @xmath66 with @xmath46 given in this paper are just one possible pair of families of graphs with the property that the @xmath67 s serve as their generating functions .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we treat the case @xmath36 ; it is simpler than @xmath37 , and makes a good warm - up . in section 3 ,",
    "we treat the case @xmath37 ( which subsumes the case @xmath38 , since we allow @xmath48 to be negative ) .",
    "section 4 gives comments and open problems arising from this work .",
    "here we study the sequence of laurent polynomials @xmath69 etc .",
    "if we let @xmath70 , then the first few terms of sequence @xmath71 for @xmath72 are @xmath73 .",
    "it is not too hard to guess that this sequence consists of every other fibonacci number ( and indeed this fact follows readily from lemma [ recur2 ] given on the next page ) .    for all @xmath74 , let @xmath75 be the ( edge - weighted ) graph shown below for the case @xmath76 .",
    "+ the graph @xmath77 .    that is",
    ", @xmath75 is a 2-by-@xmath48 grid in which every vertical edge has been assigned weight 1 and the horizontal edges alternate between weight @xmath12 and weight @xmath11 , with the two leftmost horizontal edges having weight @xmath12 , the two horizontal edges adjoining them having weight @xmath11 , the two horizontal edges adjoining _ them _ having weight @xmath12 , and so on ( ending at the right with two edges of weight @xmath12 when @xmath48 is even and with two edges of weight @xmath11 when @xmath48 is odd ) .",
    "let @xmath78 ( so that for example the above picture shows @xmath79 ) , and let @xmath60 be the sum of the weights of all the perfect matchings of @xmath66 .",
    "also let @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "we note the following combinatorial interpretation of this monomial : @xmath82 where @xmath16 is the number of square cells of @xmath66 with horizontal edges having weight @xmath12 and @xmath17 is the number of square cells with horizontal edges having weight @xmath11 . using these definitions",
    "we obtain    [ 22thm ] for the case @xmath83 , the laurent polynomials @xmath8 satisfy @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath62 are given combinatorially as in the preceding paragraph .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath86 , the graph @xmath87 has two perfect matchings with respective weights @xmath88 and @xmath89 , so @xmath90 . for @xmath91 , the graph @xmath92 has five perfect matchings with respective weights @xmath93 , @xmath88 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath94 , so @xmath95 ; since @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 , as required .",
    "we will have proved the claim if we can show that the laurent polynomials @xmath98 satisfy the same quadratic recurrence as the laurent polynomials @xmath67 ; that is , @xmath99    [ littlep ] the polynomials @xmath60 satisfy the recurrence @xmath100    to prove ( [ recur ] ) we let @xmath101 be the sum of the weights of the perfect matchings of the graph @xmath75 , so that @xmath102 for @xmath72 . each perfect",
    "matching of @xmath75 is either a perfect matching of @xmath103 with an extra vertical edge at the right ( of weight 1 ) or a perfect matching of @xmath104 with two extra horizontal edges at the right ( of weight @xmath11 or weight @xmath12 , according to whether @xmath48 is odd or even , respectively ) .",
    "we thus have @xmath105 solving the first and third equations for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , and substituting the resulting expressions into the second equation , we get @xmath108 or @xmath109 , so that we obtain    [ recur2 ] @xmath110    it is easy enough to verify that @xmath111 so for induction we assume that @xmath112 using lemma [ recur2 ] and ( [ induct ] ) we are able to verify that polynomials @xmath85 satisfy the quadratic recurrence relation ( [ recur ] ) : @xmath113    since @xmath114 we have that recurrence ( [ ratexpr ] ) reduces to recurrence ( [ recur ] ) of proposition [ littlep ] . thus @xmath98 satisfy the same initial conditions and recursion as the @xmath8 s , and we have proven theorem [ 22thm ] .    an explicit formula has recently been found for the @xmath67 s by caldero and zelevinsky using the geometry of quiver representations :    ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2 ) [ explic ] @xmath115 for all @xmath116 .",
    "they also present expressions ( equations ( 5.16 ) of @xcite ) for the @xmath8 s in terms of fibonacci polynomials , as defined in @xcite , which can easily seen to be equivalent to the combinatorial interpretation of theorem [ 22thm ] .",
    "subsequently , zelevinsky has obtained a short elementary proof of these two results @xcite .      here",
    "we provide yet a third proof of theorem [ explic ] : instead of using induction as in zelevinsky s elementary proof , we use a direct bijection .",
    "this proof was found after zelevinsky s result came to our attention .",
    "first we make precise the connection between the combinatorial interpretation of @xcite and our own .",
    "the number of ways to choose a perfect matching of @xmath117 with @xmath118 horizontal edges labeled @xmath12 and @xmath119 horizontal edges labeled @xmath11 is the number of ways to choose a subset @xmath120 such that @xmath55 contains @xmath121 odd elements , @xmath122 even elements , and no consecutive elements .",
    "notice that in the case @xmath123 , this number is the coefficient of @xmath124 in @xmath125 ( for @xmath116 ) , and when @xmath126 , this number is the coefficient of @xmath127 in @xmath128 , as defined in @xcite .    there is a bijection between perfect matchings of @xmath129 and subsets @xmath130 , with no two elements consecutive .",
    "we label the top row of edges of @xmath129 from @xmath89 to @xmath131 and map a horizontal edge in the top row to the label of that edge .",
    "since horizontal edges come in parallel pairs and span precisely two vertices , we have an inverse map as well .    with this formulation",
    "we now prove    the number of ways to choose a subset @xmath132 such that @xmath55 contains @xmath121 odd elements , @xmath122 even elements , and no consecutive elements is @xmath133 if @xmath134 and @xmath135 if @xmath136 .",
    "list the parts of @xmath55 in order of size and reduce the smallest by @xmath137 , the next smallest by @xmath3 , the next smallest by @xmath138 , and so on ( so that the largest number gets reduced by @xmath139 ) .",
    "this will yield a multiset consisting of @xmath121 not necessarily distinct odd numbers between @xmath89 and @xmath140 if @xmath134 , and between @xmath89 and @xmath141 if @xmath136 , as well as @xmath122 not necessarily distinct even numbers between @xmath89 and @xmath141 , regardless of whether @xmath142 is @xmath143 or @xmath144 .",
    "conversely , every such multiset , when you apply the bijection in reverse , you get a set consisting of @xmath121 odd numbers and @xmath122 even numbers in @xmath145 ( resp .",
    "@xmath146 ) , no two of which differ by less than @xmath3 .",
    "the number of such multisets is clearly @xmath147 in the first case and @xmath148 in the second case ( since @xmath143 is an additional odd number ) , where @xmath149@xmath48 multichoose @xmath150 \" @xmath151 . since @xmath152 ( resp .",
    "@xmath153 ) , the claim follows .",
    "once we know this interpretation for the coefficients of @xmath125 ( @xmath128 ) , we obtain a proof of the formula for the entire sum , i.e. theorem [ explic ] and theorem 5.2 of @xcite ( theorem 2.2 of @xcite ) .    it is worth remarking that the extra terms @xmath154 and @xmath155 in theorem [ explic ] correspond to the extreme case in which one s subset of @xmath156 consists of all the odd numbers in that range .",
    "the recurrence of lemma [ recur2 ] can also be proven bijectively by computing in two different ways the sum of the weights of the perfect matchings of the graph @xmath157 ( the disjoint union of @xmath66 and @xmath158 , which has all the vertices and edges of graphs @xmath66 and @xmath158 and no identifications ) .",
    "we provide this proof since this method will be used later on in the @xmath37 case .    on the one hand ,",
    "the sum of the weights of the perfect matchings of @xmath66 is the polynomial @xmath85 and the sum of the weights of the perfect matchings of @xmath158 is @xmath159 , so the sum of the weights of the perfect matchings of @xmath157 is @xmath160 .",
    "+ the sum of the weights of all perfect matchings of @xmath161 is @xmath162    on the other hand , observe that the graph @xmath163 can be obtained from @xmath157 by identifying the rightmost vertical edge of @xmath66 with the leftmost vertical edge of @xmath158 .",
    "furthermore , there is a weight - preserving bijection @xmath164 between the set of perfect matchings of the graph @xmath163 and the set of perfect matchings of @xmath157 that do not simultaneously contain the two rightmost horizontal edges of @xmath66 and the two leftmost horizontal edges of @xmath158 ( a set that can also be described as the set of perfect matchings of @xmath157 that contain either the rightmost vertical edge of @xmath66 or the leftmost vertical edge of @xmath158 or both ) .",
    "it is slightly easier to describe the inverse bijection @xmath165 : given a perfect matching of @xmath157 that contains either the rightmost vertical edge of @xmath66 or the leftmost vertical edge of @xmath158 or both , view the matching as a set of edges and push it forward by the gluing map from @xmath157 to @xmath163 .",
    "we obtain a multiset of edges of @xmath163 that contains either 1 or 2 copies of the third vertical edge from the right , and then delete 1 copy of this edge , obtaining a _ set _ of edges that contains either 0 or 1 copies of that edge .",
    "it is not hard to see that this set of edges is a perfect matching of @xmath163 , and that every perfect matching of @xmath163 arises from this operation in a unique fashion .",
    "furthermore , since the vertical edge that we have deleted has weight 1 , the operation is weight - preserving .",
    "the perfect matchings of @xmath157 that are not in the range of the bijection @xmath164 are those that consist of a perfect matching of @xmath66 that contains the two rightmost horizontal edges of @xmath66 and a perfect matching of @xmath158 that contains the two leftmost horizontal edges of @xmath158 . removing these edges yields a perfect matching of @xmath166 and a perfect matching of @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , every pair consisting of a perfect matching of @xmath166 and a perfect matching of @xmath167 occurs in this fashion .",
    "since the four removed edges have weights that multiply to @xmath168 , and @xmath167 has just a single matching ( of weight 1 ) , we see that the perfect matchings excluded from @xmath164 have total weight @xmath169 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* c.f . ) .",
    "we can also give a bijective proof of the quadratic recurrence relation ( [ recur ] ) by using a technqiue known as graphical condensation which was developed by eric kuo @xcite .",
    "he even gives the unweighted version of this example in his write - up .",
    "as we showed via equation ( [ recip ] ) , there is a reciprocity that allows us to relate the cluster algebras for the @xmath0- and @xmath170-cases by running the recurrence backwards . for the @xmath36-case ,",
    "@xmath171 so we do not get anything new when we run it backwards ; we only switch the roles of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this reciprocity is a special case of the reciprocity that occurs not just for @xmath3-by-@xmath48 grid graphs , but more generally in the problem of enumerating ( not necessarily perfect ) matchings of @xmath172-by-@xmath48 grid graphs , as seen in @xcite and @xcite . for the @xmath37-case",
    ", we will also encounter a type of reciprocity .",
    "we have seen that the sequence of polynomials @xmath101 satisfies the relation @xmath173 it is worth mentioning that the odd - indexed terms of the sequence satisfy an analogous relation @xmath174 this relation can be proven via theorem 2.3 of @xcite .",
    "in fact the sequence of laurent polynomials @xmath175 are the collection of elements of the semicanoncial basis which are not cluster monomials , i.e. not of the form @xmath176 for @xmath177 .",
    "these are denoted as @xmath128 in @xcite and @xcite and are defined as @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the normalized chebyshev polynomial of the second kind , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "we are thankful to andrei zelevinsky for alerting us to this fact .",
    "we describe an analogous combinatorial interpretation for the @xmath128 s in the @xmath37-case in subsection [ 14semi14 ] .",
    "in this case we let    @xmath182    for @xmath81 .",
    "if we let @xmath183 , the first few terms of @xmath71 for @xmath81 are : + @xmath184    splitting this sequence into two increasing subsequences , we get for @xmath74 :    @xmath185    furthermore , we can run the recurrence backwards and continue the sequence for negative values of @xmath48 :    @xmath186 + whose negative terms split into two increasing subsequences ( for @xmath74 )    @xmath187    as in the @xmath36-case , it turns out that this sequence @xmath71 ( respectively @xmath188 ) has a combinatorial interpretation as the number ( sum of the weights ) of perfect matchings in a sequence of graphs .",
    "we prove that these graphs , which we again denote as @xmath66 , have the @xmath8 s as their generating functions in the later subsections .",
    "we first give the unweighted version of these graphs where graph @xmath66 contains @xmath189 perfect matchings .",
    "we describe how to assign weights to yield the appropriate laurent polynomials @xmath8 in the next subsection , deferring proof of correctness until the ensuing two subsections .",
    "the proof of two recurrences , in sections [ sectfirst ] and [ sectsecond ] , will conclude the proof of theorem [ 14thm ] .",
    "the final subsection provides a combinatorial interpretation for elements of the semicanonical basis that are distinct from cluster monomials .",
    "[ 14graphs ] we will have four types of graphs @xmath66 , one for each of the above four sequences ( i.e.  for @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 ) .",
