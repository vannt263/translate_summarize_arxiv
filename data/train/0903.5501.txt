    "neutron - deficient isotopes in the @xmath1 mass region are known to be interesting examples where the equilibrium shape of the nucleus is the result of a critical interplay between various nuclear structure effects @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the nuclear shape in isotopic chains is rather involved due to the existence of shell gaps at nucleon numbers 34 , 36 , 38 , and 40 .",
    "thus , adding or removing a few nucleons may lead to shape transitions in neighboring nuclei .",
    "shape coexistence is also present in this mass region , where competing prolate , oblate , and spherical shapes are expected in the same nucleus at close energies .",
    "calculations of the equilibrium configurations in this mass region have been performed within different approaches , such as the configuration - dependent shell - correction approach with deformed woods - saxon potentials @xcite , selfconsistent deformed skyrme mean - field calculations @xcite , hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations with the gogny force @xcite , relativistic mean - field calculations @xcite , or the selfconsistent complex excited vampir approach @xcite .",
    "the first experimental evidence of shape coexistence in neutron - deficient kr isotopes was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite from irregularities observed at the bottom of the rotational bands .",
    "since then , a great deal of data on the low - lying excitation spectrum , including transition probabilities , have become available @xcite .",
    "one of the experimental indications revealing the existence of shape coexistence in even - even nuclei is the observation of low - lying @xmath2 excited states .",
    "each of the @xmath2 states is interpreted as a ground state corresponding to a different shape .",
    "experimental evidences for @xmath2 shape isomers in kr isotopes have been reported in refs .",
    "these states are connected by electric monopole ( @xmath3 ) transitions , whose strength is related to the change in the rms radius of the nucleus between initial and final states and carries information about the change in deformation and the overlap of the wave functions .",
    "the relationship between @xmath3 strength and shape mixing has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these references ,",
    "shape mixing and shape coexistence were analyzed in terms of a two - level model , which was shown to be a simple but successful method to interpret the phenomenology . in this model ,",
    "the strength is related to the amount of mixing of configurations with different deformations in the physical states .",
    "this simple two - level mixing model has been also successfully applied to understand the low - energy spectra of neutron - deficient kr isotopes @xcite . in these isotopes ,",
    "regular bands are observed at high spins , which is a characteristic of well deformed shapes , but for the lowest states the regularity is lost , which is interpreted as evidence for a perturbation from other close states .",
    "the anomaly at low spin observed in the systematics of the moments of inertia ( see fig . 3.37 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) has also been interpreted as an evidence for mixed ground states in the lightest sr isotopes .",
    "this mixing predicts that @xmath3 transition strengths should be observable in neutron - deficient sr isotopes .",
    "an experiment similar to the study of the @xmath4rb decay to @xmath4kr @xcite would be very helpful for the @xmath5y decay to @xmath5sr .",
    "the decay properties of nuclei in this mass region have been also investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "deformation has been identified in those works as a relevant issue to understand @xmath0-decay properties .",
    "in particular , the nuclear deformation is crucial to perform reliable calculations of nuclear reaction rates and @xmath0-decay half - lives in nuclei involved in the rapid - proton capture ( rp ) process of relevance in x - ray burst scenarios @xcite .    in this work",

    "ii a brief review of the theoretical formalism is presented . sec .",
    "iii contains the results obtained within this approach for the potential energy curves , electric monopole strengths , gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions , and @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "the results are discussed in terms of shape mixing using a two - level model .",
    "iv summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "in this section we summarize briefly the theory involved in the microscopic calculations . more details can be found in ref .",
    "the method consists in a selfconsistent formalism based on a deformed hartree - fock mean field obtained with skyrme interactions , including pairing correlations in the bcs approximation .",
    "the single - particle energies , wave functions , and occupation probabilities are generated from this mean field .",
    "two skyrme forces are considered in this paper to quantify the theoretical uncertainties caused by the use of different effective interactions .",
    "one is the force sk3 @xcite , which is one of the simplest and oldest parametrizations , and has been successfully tested against many nuclear properties in spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "the other force is sly4 @xcite , which is an example of one of the most recent parametrizations including selected properties of unstable nuclei in the adjusting procedure .",
    "the solution of the hf equation is found using the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming time reversal and axial symmetry .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "the method also includes pairing between like nucleons in bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons and neutrons , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences through a symmetric five term formula involving the experimental binding energies @xcite .",
    "the energy surfaces are analyzed as a function of the quadrupole deformation .",
    "for that purpose , constrained hf calculations are performed with a quadratic constraint @xcite .",
    "the hf energy is minimized under the constraint of keeping fixed the nuclear deformation .",
    "calculations for gt strengths are performed subsequently for the equilibrium shapes of each nucleus , that is , for the solutions , in general deformed , for which minima are obtained in the energy surfaces . since decays connecting different shapes are disfavored , similar shapes are assumed for the ground state of the parent nucleus and for all populated states in the daughter nucleus .    to describe gt transitions ,",
    "a spin - isospin residual interaction is added to the mean field .",
    "this interaction contains two parts , particle - hole ( @xmath8 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the interaction in the @xmath8 channel is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite and it can be derived consistently from the same skyrme interaction used to generate the mean field , through the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities .",

    ", this would indicate very weak mixing , which is consistent with the strong prolate component expected in these isotopes .      in previous works @xcite",
    "we have studied the sensitivity of the gt strength distributions to the various ingredients contributing to the qrpa - like calculations , namely to the nn effective force , to pairing correlations , to deformation , and to residual interactions .",
    "we found different sensitivities to them . in this work ,",
    "all of these ingredients have been fixed to the most reasonable choices found previously . here",
    ", we mainly discuss the mixing of different shapes needed to reproduce the available experimental information on the energy distributions of gt strengths .",
    "experimental information on gt strength distributions is available for @xmath44kr @xcite , @xmath4kr @xcite , and @xmath45sr @xcite .",
    "measurements on @xmath5sr are being presently analyzed @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that data for @xmath4kr , @xmath45sr , and @xmath5sr were taken using the total absorption gamma spectroscopy ( tags ) technique that avoids systematic uncertainties related to the so - called pandemonium effect associated with the high resolution techniques , used for example in the case of @xmath44kr @xcite .",
    "thus , while the gt strength has been observed over most of the @xmath60 window in the former cases , in the latter case , only the gt strength below 2 mev was extracted , which is still far from the @xmath61 mev energy .",
    "figures [ fig_bgt_sk3 ] and [ fig_bgt_sly4 ] show the cumulative gt strength distributions as a function of the excitation energy in the daughter nucleus .",
    "data are compared with sk3 and sly4 calculations corresponding to the various equilibrium configurations and to the adopted mixing . a quenching factor 0.77",
    "is included in these calculations .",
    "when the ground state of the parent nucleus is given by a superposition of prolate and oblate shapes ( eq.([prolobl ] ) ) , the final @xmath62 states reached by the action of the gt operator are either @xmath63 or @xmath64 at excitation energies given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "thus ,    @xmath67    this is certainly a simple approach that gives us only a limited insight into the more involved problem of configuration mixing , but it is a first step in this direction toward the effect of mixing in the gamow - teller strength distributions .",
    "the mixing coefficients considered in these plots correspond to the experimental mixing obtained in refs . @xcite for the kr isotopes . in the case of @xmath45sr no mixing is plotted since the prolate configuration reproduces the data fairly well . in the case of @xmath5sr , 50% mixing is plotted as a middle value useful to compare with future data . in the case of @xmath44kr ,",
    "the description of the gt strength distribution in the case of sk3 is rather similar to both shapes . on the contrary , with sly4 , the oblate shape and in particular",
    "the mixing with a 10% prolate configuration describes the data fairly .",
    "certainly , it would be interesting to extend the measurements up to the @xmath60 window and compare the calculations in the whole range of energies . in the case of @xmath4kr ,",
    "the experiment is better reproduced by the prolate shape with the two skyrme forces . however , mixing with the oblate shape improves the results although 50% mixing seems to be very strong .",
    "the prolate configuration alone gives a good description of the gt strength distributions in @xmath45sr with both sk3 and sly4 forces .",
    "the oblate shape generates a rather flat profile above 2 mev that fails to account for the experimental profile of the strength distribution .",
    "the calculated strength distributions in @xmath5sr show a very pronounced stepwise profile in the spherical case , as it corresponds to transitions between degenerate states . in the prolate case",
    "the strength is more fragmented .",
    "the total accumulated strength up to about 3 mev is similar with the two forces , but in the case of sk3 , there is a strong transition just below @xmath60 which doubles the strength . in the case of sly4 , this strong transition occurs a little bit above @xmath68 mev .",
    "these results also can be compared with other calculations such as those performed within a tamm - dancoff approximation with sk3 interaction @xcite . in this reference , strengths contained in bins of 1 mev were plotted and no further details within the @xmath60 window were shown .",
    "nevertheless , there is qualitative agreement with our results .",
    "more recently , results from the complex excited vampir variational approach with bonn potentials , on @xmath44kr and @xmath4kr , have been published @xcite . in the case of @xmath44kr , the profile of the cumulative gt strength in ref .",
    "@xcite presents a strong jump at around 1 mev with a continuous increase elsewhere .",
    "this is at variance with experiment which does not show this behavior . for @xmath4kr ,",
    "again a sudden increase of the strength at 1 mev is found in @xcite which does not show up in the experiment .",
    "the total strength is considerably underestimated by the calculations even though no quenching is considered in that work .",
    "the half - lives calculated according to eq.([t12 ] ) can be seen in table i. the results correspond to the different equilibrium deformations of the various isotopes , as well as to the mixed configurations obtained with similar mixing as those considered in figs .",
    "[ fig_bgt_sk3 ] and [ fig_bgt_sly4 ] for the gt strength distributions .",
    "experimental @xmath60 values have been used in these calculations .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath39 functions in eq.([t12 ] ) weight differently the strength depending on the energy . as a result , the half - lives are more sensitive to the strength located at certain excitation energies .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_f_factors ] the @xmath39 functions corresponding to the @xmath69-decay , to the electron capture , and the total @xmath39 plotted versus the excitation energy of the daughter nucleus .",
    "the first thing to notice is that these factors are larger at lower excitation energies ( higher energy of the @xmath0-particle ) and therefore , the contribution of the strength at low excitation energies to the half - lives is highly favored .",
    "one can also see that the @xmath69 component is the dominant contribution at lower excitation energy and it goes roughly like @xmath70 . at higher energies ,",
    "electron capture becomes dominant and it is indeed the only component between @xmath71 and @xmath60 , where electron capture is allowed but positron emission is energetically forbidden .",
    "the results in table i obtained for @xmath44kr are once more compatible with predominantly oblate shape with a 10% prolate mixing @xcite , although a little bit more mixing is favored ( actually the half - life is reproduced with @xmath72 in the case of sk3 and with @xmath73 in the case of sly4 ) . in the case of @xmath4kr",
    "one can see that the 50% maximal mixing considered also reproduces the experimental data reasonably well . in the case of the sk3 force",
    ", @xmath74 reproduces the half - life .",
    "the half - life of @xmath45sr is compatible with a pure prolate shape , as in the case with the gt strength distribution . in the case of @xmath5sr , a mixing of the spherical and prolate configurations in sk3",
    "reproduces the half - life , while in the case of sly4 a prolate configuration is favored .",
    "in this paper @xmath0-decay properties of neutron - deficient kr and sr isotopes are calculated within a deformed qrpa approach based on mean fields generated from selfconsistent skyrme hartree - fock calculations .",
    "a simple two - state mixing model has been used to mix the intrinsic configurations into the physical states .",
    "it is shown that in some cases a single shape accounts for the main characteristics of the gt strength distributions and the half - lives .",
    "in other cases the data appear between the predictions of various shapes , demanding a more sophisticated treatment . here",
    "we have considered a rough estimate of the mixing using the same coefficients extracted phenomenologically from coulomb excitation experiments and have found that they reproduce the gt strength distributions and half - lives fairly well .",
    "thus , we get a globally consistent picture when describing the isotope @xmath44kr as a mainly oblate nucleus with small admixtures from a prolate configuration , the isotope @xmath4kr as a more mixed nucleus with a dominant prolate configuration , the isotope @xmath45sr as an almost prolate nucleus , and the isotope @xmath5sr as a mixed spherical / prolate nucleus .",
    "the main objective in this paper has been to demonstrate that this approach is able to account for the main features of the decay properties of nuclei in this mass region , which are characterized by deformation as a key ingredient .",
    "this study provides additional and complementary indications in favor of shape coexistence in this mass region that is consistent with the information extracted from low - energy coulomb excitation experiments .",
    "this approach can not be pushed forward at a more quantitative description since the results are not only sensitive to the details of the present calculation but may also be sensitive to dynamical effects beyond mean - field approach not considered in this work . in this respect , it is worth pointing out that multiple coulomb excitation data are beginning to yield sufficient numbers of @xmath75 matrix elements for construction not only of quadrupole centroids but also fluctuation widths for the lowest few states in even - even nuclei @xcite .",
