    "the merger of a black hole ( bh ) and a neutron star ( ns ) is one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves  @xcite",
    ". it could be also one of the strongest high - energy phenomena in the universe , if the ns is tidally disrupted by the companion bh before the onset of the merger .",
    "previous numerical - relativity simulations  @xcite have shown that after tidal disruption , a system composed of a bh and a torus is formed .",
    "this system could be the central engine of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs )  @xcite .",
    "it is also found that during tidal disruption , an appreciable amount of mass is ejected  @xcite .",
    "such ejecta , which should be neutron - rich , will subsequently produce heavy elements via r - process nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "the produced unstable heavy elements will subsequently decay , heat - up the ejecta , and shine  @xcite .",
    "such an electromagnetic signal could be an electromagnetic counterpart to detected gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "these facts motivate us to perform physically reliable numerical - relativity simulation of bh - ns mergers . here , the presence of strong magnetic fields is one of the most characteristic properties of nss  @xcite .",
    "however , the role of the magnetic fields in their merger process is still poorly known .",
    "bh - ns mergers can be subject to tidal disruption , for a broad range of the ns compactness , the mass ratio of bh to ns , and bh spin  @xcite .",
    "an accretion torus , expected to be formed around the remnant bh , is subject to the magnetorotational instability ( mri )  @xcite , and thus , the magnetic field will be amplified .",
    "previously , it was difficult to perform high - resolution simulations to resolve the fastest growing mode of the mri because of limited computational resources , although several preliminary numerical - relativity simulations have been carried out  @xcite .    in this paper , we report the results of our latest general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) simulation for the bh - ns merger performed on japanese supercomputer k. the highest - resolution simulation performed so far together with an in - depth resolution study was done .",
    "einstein s equation is solved in a puncture - baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura formalism together with fourth - order finite differencing  @xcite and the grmhd equations are solved by a high - resolution shock capturing scheme .",
    "the simulations are performed using a fixed - mesh refinement ( fmr ) algorithm in which each refinement level labeled by @xmath0 covers the cubic domain of @xmath1 $ ] with @xmath2 being the grid spacing of level @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) . typically , we set @xmath6 and the finest grid domain is a @xmath7 cube . to examine how the result depends on the grid resolution , we change @xmath8 m , @xmath9 m , @xmath10 m , and @xmath11 m , respectively .",
    "we show the grid set - up in our simulations in table  [ tab1 ] . in the highest - resolution run ,",
    "we use @xmath12 cpus .    as initial data ,",
    "we prepare a bh - ns binary in quasi - equilibrium using the method of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we model the ns by the akmal - pandhalipande - ravenhall eos  @xcite which is compatible with a maximum neutron star mass @xmath13 as required by current observational constraints  @xcite .",
    "we set the ns mass , the mass ratio of bh to ns , and the dimensionless aligned spin of bh , @xmath14 , to be @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively . the initial orbital angular velocity is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the gravitational constant , @xmath20 is the sum of bh and ns gravitational mass in isolation , and @xmath21 is the speed of light . with these parameters ,",
    "a massive accretion torus is formed after tidal disruption  @xcite .",
    "the initial magnetic - field configuration is given in terms of the vector potential as  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the coordinate center of the ns , @xmath25 is the pressure , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the maximum rest - mass density and we set @xmath30 such that the initial maximum magnetic - field strength is @xmath31 g. even if we start a simulation with this _ ad hoc _ localized seed magnetic field , the resulting torus surrounding the remnant bh becomes in a turbulence - like state and a global magnetic field is naturally formed eventually .",
    "the magnetic - field strength is chosen so that the wavelength of the fastest growing mode of the non - axisymmetric mri is larger than @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the resulting turbulence - like state should not depend critically on the initial magnetic - field configuration and strength as long as the mri is resolved  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of the dependence of the saturation amplitude on the initial field configuration ) .",
    "the eos is parametrized by a piecewise polytrope  @xcite and a gamma - law eos is added during the simulation to capture shock heating effects with thermal gamma of 1.8 . other choice of thermal gamma could affect the amount of the torus wind .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows snapshots of the rest - mass density profile with the magnetic - field lines . before swallowed by the bh , the ns is tidally disrupted .",
    "a part of ns matter subsequently forms an accretion torus around the remnant bh with mass of @xmath33 at @xmath34 10 ms after the tidal disruption .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability develops in the contact interfaces of the wound spiral arm because of the presence of shear motion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a and the vortices are generated subsequently enhancing the magnetic - field energy . in addition , the non - axisymmetric mri activates amplification of the magnetic - field strength  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "the mass accretion is enhanced by turbulence - like motion which is generated by these mhd instabilities as well as by the gravitational torque exerted by the non - axisymmetric structure of the accretion torus ( see fig .  [ fig1]c and visualization in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] plots the ejecta mass , torus mass , mass accretion rate onto the bh , and ratio of the magnetic - field energy , @xmath35 , to internal energy , @xmath36 , as functions of time .",
    "we define the merger time @xmath37 to be the time at which the gravitational - wave amplitude becomes maximal .",
    "the ejecta is defined to be fluid elements which reside outside the bh and have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lower time component of the four velocity .",
    "this criterion means that the fluid elements are gravitationally unbounded .",
    "the primary mass - ejection mechanism is tidal torque exerted during tidal disruption and this _ dynamical _ ejecta is seen for @xmath40 ms in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . during this early phase , ns matter of @xmath41",
    "is ejected approximately along the orbital plane .",
    "this result agrees with that found in refs .",
    "@xcite , which demonstrates that our findings will remain robust also for a larger initial separation .    after this primary phase",
    ", a new ejecta component appears . in the highest - resolution run ,",
    "the accumulated accretion mass onto the bh for @xmath42 ms is @xmath43 , while the torus mass decreases by @xmath44 over the same time .",
    "this implies that a significant amount of the torus mass is ejected by a torus wind .",
    "the launch time and amount of material ejected by the wind depend strongly on the grid resolution : the higher - resolution runs result in an earlier launch time and larger amount of the ejecta .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the bh also depends on the grid resolution : for higher resolutions , it is smaller .",
    "the reason for these facts will be described later .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that irrespective of the grid resolution , the magnetic - field energy is exponentially enhanced and eventually saturated : @xmath35 is typically 0.1% of @xmath36 .",
    "the growth rates of @xmath35 for @xmath45 ms correspond to 78% of the orbital angular velocity .",
    "this growth rate agrees approximately with that of the non - axisymmetric mri predicted by the linear perturbation analysis  @xcite .    to see that our grid setting is sufficient to resolve the fastest growing mode of the non - axisymmetric mri , fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] plots a snapshot of wavelength of the fastest growing mode of the non - axisymmetric mri on a meridional ( @xmath46-@xmath28 ) plane at @xmath47 ms .",
    "we estimate the wavelength by @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are an azimuthal component of the magnetic field measured in the fluid rest frame , the rest - mass density , the specific enthalpy , and the angular velocity , respectively .",
    "the wavelength is longer than @xmath53 km in a large portion of the region and this indicates the fastest growing mode is covered by more than ten grid points even in the lowest - resolution run .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] clearly shows it .",
    "therefore , turbulence - like motion produced by the mri , which is resolved in our numerical simulation , plays an important role in the mass ejection .",
    "we discuss this point later .    in the presence of neutrino radiation , the growth rate of the fastest growing mri mode",
    "could be significantly suppressed once neutrino viscosity and drag turn on  @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the neutrino viscosity @xmath54 , the neutrino mean free path @xmath55 , and the wavelength of the fastest growing mri mode @xmath56 in the viscous regime are : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . note that these estimates would depend on the structure of the accretion torus  @xcite .",
    "assuming the gas , photons , and relativistic electron and positrons contribute to the specific thermal energy , we evaluate the temperature from the thermal component of the specific internal energy  @xcite .",
    "we utilize the data of the density , angular velocity , and the specific internal energy along @xmath46-axis on the equatorial plane at @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig3b ] plots the radial profile of @xmath55 and @xmath61 . in the entire region",
    ", @xmath55 is always longer than @xmath61 , which implies that the effect of neutrinos on the mri is not described by the viscosity , but by the neutrino drag .",
    "the neutrino drag is characterized by the damping rate @xmath62 of the velocity fluctuation due to the momentum transport . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath63 . the radial profile of @xmath62 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] . because @xmath64 in the entire region , the growth rate of the mri is not affected by the neutrino drag .",
    "although there is an ambiguity in terms of the accretion torus structure and the temperature estimation , we conclude that the mri growth rate is not significantly different from that of the ideal mhd in this bh - ns merger .",
    "the mri will grow exponentially even if we assume a weak magnetic - field strength of @xmath65 g.    figure  [ fig3 ] plots snapshots of the rest - mass density , plasma @xmath66 ( the ratio of matter pressure to magnetic pressure ) , thermal component of specific internal energy , and sum of the maxwell and reynolds stress on the @xmath46-@xmath28 plane at @xmath67 ms for the highest - resolution run .",
    "we also plot contours of @xmath39 . here",
    ", @xmath68 is an effective potential of a test particle moving in stationary and axisymmetric bh spacetime  @xcite .",
    "the shape of curves in the vicinity of the rotational axis with @xmath69 is approximately parabolic . in the newtonian limit , @xmath70",
    "is reduced to @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the bh mass , cylindrical coordinate , and specific angular momentum , respectively .",
    "we assume constant specific angular momentum for simplicity . in this case",
    ", for a given value of @xmath73 the contour of @xmath69 becomes parabolic .",
    "if the specific angular momentum for fluid elements is sufficiently enhanced or fluid elements are pushed to high latitude ( @xmath74 ) by thermal pressure , they could have @xmath75 @xmath76  @xcite ( see the discussion in the next paragraph ) . because there is no matter in the region above the torus",
    ", the wind , once it is launched , expands in the widely spread radial direction by contrast with the tidally induced ejecta .",
    "subsequently , a funnel wall is formed .",
    "the point to be clarified is how fluid elements are injected into the region with @xmath38 @xmath77 .",
    "we find that @xmath66 at the launch time of the wind is much greater than unity near the torus ; pure magnetic pressure would not be the main agent of the injection .",
    "the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicates that there is a hot region in the vicinity of the bh , which produces a steep pressure gradient . due to this gradient",
    ", the fluid elements are accelerated radially and become unbound once they reach the region with @xmath38 @xmath77(see ref .",
    "@xcite for essentially the same discussion ) .    to explore the mechanism to enhance the thermal pressure",
    ", we analyze the specific kinetic - energy spectrum @xmath78 , which is calculated by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a wavenumber vector , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the volume element in a spherical shell between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is a cubic region of @xmath86 \\in [ 50,70]$ ] , @xmath87 \\in [ -10,10]$ ] , @xmath88 \\in [ -10,10]$ ] .",
    "we choose @xmath89 as the center of the cube and @xmath90 is the position vector from the center .",
    "the fluctuation of the velocity @xmath91 is @xmath92 inside the chosen cube .",
    "@xmath93 denotes the time average for the duration @xmath94 ms .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] plots this energy spectrum for all runs .",
    "this shows that ( i ) the spectrum is extended to smaller scales in the higher - resolution runs , indicating that the energy is injected at a small scale at which the mri develops and ( ii ) the spectrum amplitude is higher for the higher - resolution runs .",
    "numerically resolvable wavelength of the fastest growing mode of the mri becomes shorter with increasing the grid resolution .",
    "therefore , the wavenumber for which the mri develops is given by @xmath95 for the highest - resolution run , @xmath96 for the middle - resolution run , @xmath97 for the normal - resolution run , and @xmath98 for the lowest - resolution run , respectively .",
    "this is expected to be approximately equal to the energy injection scale in @xmath78 .",
    "assuming that a turbulent state is realized , the specific energy dissipation rate is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the scale of the vortices  @xcite . because the turbulent energy is proportional to @xmath101 , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] suggests that @xmath102 becomes higher in the higher - resolution runs for a given scale @xmath100 .",
    "this indicates that the effective turbulent viscosity , @xmath103 , increases with increasing resolution . due to the realistic high viscosity achieved by this turbulence - like motion ,",
    "the mass accretion inside the accretion torus is enhanced in the higher - resolution runs and the mass accretion energy is efficiently converted to thermal energy in the vicinity of the bh  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4a ] plots snapshots of the thermal component of specific internal energy on the @xmath46-@xmath28 plane at @xmath104 ms for @xmath105 m and @xmath11 m. comparing to the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the thermal component of specific internal energy in the vicinity of the inner edge of torus and the torus interior is larger than that in the rest of torus in the higher resolution run .",
    "this trend indicates that efficient thermalization of the mass accretion energy due to the effective turbulent viscosity would be realized as discussed above .",
    "consequently , the torus - wind power is enhanced while the mass accretion onto the bh is suppressed  @xcite , which can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indeed shows that the energy is transferred outward . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] , the amount of the ejecta mass and the spectrum of the matter flow do not exhibit the convergence .",
    "however , with the improvement of the grid resolution , the total amount of the torus wind mass increases and this indicates that our highest - resolution results would show the lower bound of the total wind mass .",
    "the high bh spin with a small horizon radius , which is necessary for tidal disruption of realistic bh - ns binaries  @xcite , prevents the fluid elements from being accreted on the remnant bh .",
    "then , the fluid elements tend to stay in the vicinity of the bh and the pressure gradient is enhanced  @xcite .",
    "this is also the key to push the fluid elements outward  @xcite . in our simulation",
    ", the bh is spun up to @xmath106 , which implies the radius of the inner most stable circular orbit is so small @xmath107  @xcite that an efficient draining by the bh is prohibited .",
    "hence , the accretion onto the bh is suppressed  @xcite ( see also the panel ( c ) of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the amount of the torus wind mass is @xmath108 in the highest - resolution run , which corresponds to about 50 @xmath109 of the torus mass at @xmath110 ms .",
    "as discussed above , the pressure gradient in the vicinity of the bh accelerates the outflow and this results in the formation of coherent poloidal magnetic fields because the magnetic - field lines are frozen into fluid elements .",
    "a low-@xmath66 region is formed along the funnel wall in the wind phase .",
    "subsequently , the magnetic pressure pushes matter and magnetic - field lines to the polar region because there is only dilute matter in this region at the wind launch .",
