    "given the short particle acceleration timescales inferred from observations of solar flares , it has been assumed that the acceleration processes are decoupled from other processes in most theoretical models @xcite . as a result",

    "there are significant ambiguities in quantitative tests of specific models with observations due to free parameters introduced to characterise the related , not - well - understood processes . on the other hand ,",
    "particle acceleration is just one important aspect of the energy release processes , which are essentially multi - scale as evident from the rich time , space , and energy characteristics of flares .",
    "direct modelling of the energy release , which can be related to magnetohydrodynamical simulations of large - scale processes , may better our understanding of flares . in the context of stochastic particle acceleration ( sa ) by turbulent electromagnetic fields ,",
    "we introduce the concept of elementary energy release events characterised with an energy release rate and length scale and discuss its implications .",
    "the relation between the gradually varying thermal and bursty nonthermal emission component is a critical aspect of flare studies @xcite .",
    "previous modelling focused on the correlation between the light - curve of nonthermal emission and derivative of the thermal emission light - curve @xcite .",
    "this correlation has been attributed to chromospheric evaporation driven by a beam of nonthermal electrons that is injected at the top of flaring coronal loops , propagates to the chromosphere along magnetic field lines , and collisionally heats the background plasma @xcite . in this ` classical ' electron beam model ,",
    "most of the nonthermal energy is reprocessed to appear as thermal energy producing the dominant thermal signatures @xcite .",
    "however , this model does not address the origin of impulsive nonthermal electrons , and has difficulties in accounting impulsive soft x - ray emission observed from some footpoints and slower than expected decay of thermal emission after the nonthermal emission already disappears @xcite . by assuming a low - energy cutoff for a power - law or broken - power - law nonthermal electron distribution , observations give a very poor constraint on the energetics since the beam power is dominated by low - energy electrons due to steep power - law slopes , and there are uncertainties in observationally constraining this low cutoff energy due to the dominance of low - energy x - rays by a thermal component @xcite .",
    "such a cutoff is also not expected in most theoretical models hampering further investigations even for some well - observed flares @xcite . with the elementary energy release events ,",
    "we propose a simple alternative to this electron beam model .",
    "the model is based on two facts that , 1 ) while low - energy particles couple strongly with each other through coulomb collisions forming a thermal distribution , 2 ) high - energy particles must decouple from the thermal background and obtain their energy through interactions with electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the key issues are then the dynamics of the fields and their interactions with charged particles .",
    "a significant amount of energy can be released during flares , and the flux of nonthermal particles inferred from observations in combination with the source size measurement sometimes implies a nonthermal particle density possibly comparable to that of the coronal background plasma @xcite , suggesting very efficient acceleration . a large fraction of the solar corona must be involved if the bulk of the energy and accelerated particles are stored in the pre - flare coronal magnetic fields , as postulated in most theoretical models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong coronal magnetic field implies tiny gyro - radii for charged particles . an energy cascade from large to small scales appears to be inevitable .",
    "turbulence is the most natural agent for energy cascade over a large dynamical range , and the corresponding sa models have been widely used for solar flare studies @xcite .    in these models",
    "a broad spectrum of particles is energised by interacting stochastically with a spectrum of electromagnetic fluctuations over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales .",
    "one of the key features of the sa is that wave - particle interactions determine not only the energy gain rate of particles but also their spatial diffusion along magnetic field lines .",
    "consequently , the particle acceleration is very sensitive to the turbulence intensity @xcite , which may explain the bursty behaviour of nonthermal emissions .",
    "detailed studies of nonthermal hard x - rays ( hxrs ) also reveal spectral soft - hard - soft ( shs ) evolution of hxr pulses suggesting independent electron acceleration events @xcite .",
    "we propose a phenomenological model for the evolution of turbulence associated with elementary energy release events and use two coefficients to characterise electron interactions with the turbulence ( section [ turbulence ] ) .",
    "the model can naturally fit hxr observations . with imaging spectroscopic observations of rhessi",
    ", the model will allow us to extract the turbulence properties and its evolution for individual well - observed flares , which constrain the wave - particle interactions and better our understanding of the relation between the thermal and nonthermal emission components ( section [ dis ] ) .",

    "all these point to the sa model , where electrons are accelerated by magnetised turbulence in flaring loops @xcite",
    ". the acceleration site can be as compact as the observed coronal looptop sources and may also extend over the whole loops if the turbulence is transported along the loops quickly , e.g. , in the form of plasma waves @xcite .",
    "the latter may explain impulsive soft x - ray emission from footpoints as electrons are injected at the footpoints directly . in this paper , we propose a simple phenomenological sa model and show that the nonthermal electron density in the acceleration site is very sensitive to the turbulence intensity .",
    "it therefore provides a mechanism to produce impulsive emissions even with a relatively gradual energy release process , which may account for the continuous heating inferred from thermal source evolution after the impulsive phase . with a simple model for the turbulence evolution",

    "detailed modelling of the plasma heating and chromospheric evaporation is needed to quantify the flux and spectral index correlation .",
    "solar flares are multi - scale phenomena in terms of not only the size and duration but also the amount of energy released by each flare",
    ". the physical processes involved in the large - scale energy release process can be scale dependent , which in combination with the variety of initial and boundary conditions in the solar atmosphere is expected to lead to very rich appearance @xcite .",
    "however , the microscopic scale processes of plasma heating and particle acceleration should be mostly determined by properties of the background plasma in terms of temperature , density , and large scale magnetic field .",
    "besides coulomb collisions among these particles , particle interactions with the electromagnetic field fluctuations during the energy release process may be parameterized with an acceleration and scattering coefficient .",
    "we show in the paper that these two coefficients , in combination with the turbulence intensity and generation scale , should be used to determine the electron distribution in flaring loops and applied to individual flares .",
