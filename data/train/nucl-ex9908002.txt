    "the charge distribution of the neutron is described by the charge form factor @xmath20 , which is related to the fourier transform of the distribution and is generally expressed as a function of @xmath21 , the square of the four - momentum transfer .",
    "data on @xmath20 are important for our understanding of the nucleon and are essential for the interpretation of electromagnetic multipoles of nuclei , e.g. the deuteron .",
    "since a practical target of free neutrons is not available , experimentalists mostly resorted to ( quasi)elastic scattering of electrons from unpolarized deuterium@xcite to determine this form factor .",
    "the shape of @xmath20 as function of @xmath21 is relatively well known from high precision elastic electron - deuteron scattering@xcite , but the absolute scale still contains a systematic uncertainty of about 50% .",
    "the slope of @xmath20 at @xmath22  ( gev / c)@xmath3 is known from measurements where thermal neutrons are scattered from atomic electrons  @xcite .    the systematic uncertainties can be significantly reduced through the measurement of electronuclear spin observables .",
    "the scattering cross section with both longitudinal polarized electrons and a polarized target for the @xmath23 reaction , can be written as  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the unpolarized cross section , @xmath26 the polarization of the electrons , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) the vector ( tensor ) polarization of the target .",
    "the target analyzing powers and spin - correlation parameters ( @xmath29 ) , depend on the orientation of the nuclear spin .",
    "the polarization direction of the deuteron is defined by the angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the frame where the @xmath32-axis is along the direction of the three - momentum transfer ( @xmath33 ) and the @xmath34-axis is defined by the vector product of the incoming and outgoing electron momenta .",
    "the observable @xmath35 contains an interference term , where the effect of the small charge form factor is amplified by the dominant magnetic form factor ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we describe a measurement performed at nikhef ( amsterdam ) , which uses a stored polarized electron beam and a vector - polarized deuterium target , to determine @xmath20 via a measurement of @xmath36 .",
    "the experiment was performed with a polarized gas target internal to the amps electron storage ring . an atomic beam source (",
    "abs)@xcite was used to inject a flux of @xmath37 deuterium atoms / s into a cooled storage cell .",
    "polarized electrons were produced by photo - emission from a strained - layer semiconductor cathode ( ingaasp)@xcite .",
    "after linear acceleration to 720  mev the electrons were injected and stacked in the amps storage ring .",
    "every 5 minutes the ring was refilled , after reversal of the electron polarization at the source .",
    "the polarization of the stored electrons was maintained by setting the spin tune to 0.5 with a strong solenoidal field ( using the siberian snake principle@xcite ) .",
    "scattered electrons were detected in the large - acceptance magnetic spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the electron detector was positioned at a central angle of 40@xmath38 , resulting in a central value of @xmath39(gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "neutrons and protons were detected in a time - of - flight ( tof ) system made of two subsequent and identical scintillator arrays .",
    "each of the four bars in an array was preceded by two plastic scintillators used to identify and/or veto charged particles . by simultaneously detecting protons and neutrons in the same detector",
    ", one can construct asymmetry ratios for the two reaction channels @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in this way minimizing systematic uncertainties associated with the deuteron ground - state wave function , absolute beam and target polarizations , and possible dilution by cell - wall background events .",
    "an experimental asymmetry ( @xmath42 ) can be constructed , where @xmath43 is the number of events that pass the selection criteria , with @xmath44 either positive or negative .",
    "@xmath45 for the @xmath40-channel , integrated up to a missing momentum of 200  mev/@xmath2 , was used to determine the effective product of beam and target polarization by comparing to the predictions of the model of arenhvel _ et al . _",
    "this advanced , non - relativistic model has shown to provide good descriptions for quasifree proton knockout from tensor - polarized deuterium@xcite .",
    "finite acceptance effects were taken into account with a monte carlo code .",
    "the spin - correlation parameter for the neutron events was obtained from the experimental asymmetry by correcting for the contribution of protons misidentified as neutrons ( less than 1% , as determined from a calibration with the reaction @xmath46h(@xmath47 ) ) , and for the product of beam and target polarization , as determined from the @xmath40 channel .    .",
    "the solid circle shows our result , the cross , open circle , and square the results from double polarization measurments on @xmath48he  @xcite and the triangle on @xmath3h  @xcite .",
    "the shaded area indicates the systematic uncertainty from ref .",

    "the data are compared to the predictions of the full model of arenhvel _ _ et al.__@xcite , assuming the dipole parameterization for the magnetic form factor of the neutron , folded over the detector acceptance with our monte carlo code for various values of @xmath20 .",
    "full model calculations are required for a reliable extraction of @xmath20 .",
    "we extract @xmath50 , where the first ( second ) error indicates the statistical ( systematic ) uncertainty .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare our experimental result to other data obtained with spin - dependent electron scattering .",
    "the figure also shows the results from ref .",
    "it is seen that our result favors their extraction of @xmath20 which uses the nijmegen potential .",
    "in summary , we presented the first measurement of the sideways spin - correlation parameter @xmath36 in quasifree electron - deuteron scattering from which we extract the neutron charge form factor at @xmath51 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 . when combined with the known value and slope @xcite at @xmath52 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 and the elastic electron - deuteron scattering data from ref .",
