    "in recent years the study of quantum dynamics of oscillators with time - dependent parameters has been focus of considerable attention .",
    "this interest is justified by many applications in different contexts .",
    "particulary , one application concerns to the center of mass motion of a laser cooled and trapped ion in a paul trap @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamics of an anharmonic oscillator ( aho ) with time dependent modulation of its frequency and nonlinearity parameters has been investigated in applications to macroscopic superposition of quantum states @xcite . in the last few years",
    "there has been rapid progress in the construction and manipulation of nanomechanical oscillators with giant @xmath0-kerr nonlinearity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the nanomechanical resonator with a significant fourth - order nonlinearity in the elastic potential energy has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that this system is dynamically equivalent to the duffing oscillator with varied driving force @xcite .",
    "this scheme is widely employed for a large variety of applications as well as the other schemes of micro- and nanomechanical oscillators , more commonly as sensors or actuators in integrated electrical , optical , and optoelectrical systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is well assessed that in the case of unitary dynamics , without any losses , an anharmonic oscillator leads to sub - poissonian statistics of oscillatory excitation number , quadratic squeezing and superposition of macroscopically distinguishable coherent states . for dissipative dynamics",
    "the important parameter responsible for production of nonclassical states via @xmath0 materials is the ratio between nonlinearity and damping .",
    "therefore , the practical realization of such quantum effects requires a high nonlinearity with respect to dissipation . in this direction",
    "the largest nonlinear interaction was proposed in many papers , particularly , in terms of electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite and by using the purcell effect @xcite , and in cavity qed @xcite .",
    "the significant nonlinearity has also been observed for nanomechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "these methods can lead to @xmath0 nonlinearity of several orders of magnitude higher than natural optical self - kerr interactions .",
    "note , that high @xmath0 nonlinear oscillators generate also a lot of interest recently due to their applications in areas of quantum computing @xcite .    in the case of nonlinear dissipative @xmath0 interaction stimulated by coherent driving force",
    ", the time evolution can not be solved analytically for arbitrary evolution times and suitable numerical methods have to be used .",
    "nevertheless , with dissipation included a driven aho model has been solved exactly in the steady - state regime in terms of the fokker - planck equation in complex p representation @xcite .",
    "analogous solution has been obtained for a combined driven parametric oscillator with kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the wigner functions for both these models have been obtained using these solutions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the investigation of quantum dynamics of a driven dissipative nonlinear oscillator for non - stationary cases is much more complicated and only a few papers have been done in this field up to now .",
    "more recently , the quantum version of dissipative aho or the duffing oscillator with time - modulated driving force has been studied in the series of the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the context of a stochastic resonance @xcite , quantum - to - classical transition and investigation of quantum dissipative chaos @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we continue investigation of time - modulated effects for quantum version of the duffing oscillator . in this direction",
    "we investigate quantum effects in the presence of dissipation and decoherence , mainly sub - poissonian statistics and signature of quantum interference within the framework of the wigner function for an oscillatory mode .",
    "two schemas of time modulation : ( i ) periodic variation of the strength of the @xmath0 nonlinearity ; ( ii ) modulation of the amplitude of the driving force will be considered .",
    "our main result is that time modulation of the oscillatory parameters essentially improves the degree of sub - poissonian statistics of oscillatory excitation numbers as well as leads to negative values of the wigner functions in an over transient regime for definite time intervals exceeding the transient time within the period of modulation .",
    "thus , we demonstrate that for the case of time - modulated aho the wigner function gradually deviates from the wigner function corresponding to an ordinary aho without any modulation .",
    "really , surprisingly simple analytical results for the wigner functions of an ordinary aho have been analytically obtained in over transient regime @xcite , @xcite , that are positive in all ranges of phase - space . in our scheme",
    "the negative values for the wigner function of oscillatory mode , that reflect quantum - interference patterns in phase space , appear due to time - modulation dynamics and are realized in both bistable and chaotic operational regimes .",
    "note , that nowadays , large theoretical and experimental papers have been devoted to the implementation of macroscopic ( i.e. , many particle ) quantum superposition states ( mqs ) .",
    "the most notable results on mqs are experimentally obtained with atoms interacting with microwave fields trapped inside a cavity @xcite or for freely propagating fields @xcite and with optical parametric amplifier in the presence of decoherence @xcite .",
    "naturally , the question arises whether the quantum - interference patterns obtained for driven aho can be realized for time intervals exceeding the characteristic decoherence and dissipation time on many particle level .",
    "the corresponding results obtained here are verified for the operational regimes of high nonlinearity with respect to dissipation , e.g. , for the ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the nonlinear constant proportional to @xmath0 and @xmath3 is the damping constant .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked for these parameters that phase - space interference patterns are also obtained in the macroscopic level that involves a number of oscillatory excitation numbers in excess of @xmath4 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the models and investigate the mean oscillatory excitation numbers and quantum fluctuations of excitation numbers on the base of the mandel parameters . in sec .",
    "iii we shortly discuss the case of the unitary dynamics . in sec .",
    "iv we present the results for the wigner functions showing negativity due to the time modulations of the oscillatory dynamics .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "this model seems experimentally feasible and can be realized in several experimental schemes .",
    "in fact , a single mode field is well described in terms of an aho , and the nonlinear medium could be an optical fiber or a @xmath19 crystal , placed in a cavity .",
    "the anharmonicity of mode dynamics comes from the self - phase modulation due to the photon - photon interaction in the @xmath19 medium . in this case",
    ", it is possible to realize time modulation of the strength of the nonlinearity by using a media with periodic variation of the @xmath19 susceptibility .    on the other side , the hamiltonian described by eq .",

    "one of the variants of nano - oscillators is based on a double - clamped platinum beam @xcite for which the nonlinearity parameter equals to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the critical amplitude at which the resonance amplitude has an infinite slope as a function of the driving frequency , @xmath24 is the mechanical quality factor of the resonator . in this case , the giant nonlinearity @xmath25 was realized .",
    "note , that details of this resonator , including expression for the parameter @xmath26 , are presented in @xcite . on decreasing nanomechanical resonator mass , its resonance frequency increases , exceeding 1 ghz in recent experiments @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is possible to reach a quantum regime for such frequencies , i.e. , to cool down the temperatures for which thermal energy will be comparable to the energy of oscillatory quanta .",
    "the recent investigations in this direction are devoted to classical to quantum transition of a driven nanomechanical oscillator @xcite , generation of fock states @xcite , nonlinear dynamics , and stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "cyclotron oscillations of a single electron in a penning trap with a magnetic field are another realization of the quantum version of the duffing oscillator @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this case",
    "the anharmonicity comes from nonlinear effect that is caused by the relativistic motion of an electron in a trap , while the dissipation effects arise from the spontaneous emission of the synchrotron radiation and thermal fluctuations of the cyclotron motion .",
    "note that a one - electron oscillator allows one to achieve a relatively strong cubic nonlinearity , @xmath27 .    for the constant parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 the equations ( [ eq : master_equatin ] ) and ( [ eq : peturbation ] ) describe the model of a driven dissipative aho that was introduced long ago in quantum optics to describe bistability due to a kerr nonlinear medium @xcite . for the case of time - dependent parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 the dynamics of the aho exhibits a rich phase - space structure , including regimes of regular , bistable and chaotic motion .",

    "the interaction hamiltonian is explicitly time dependent , and the system exhibits regions of regular , bistable , and chaotic motion with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the modulation frequency being the control parameters .",
    "we examine these operational regimes by numerical analysis of the phase space of dimensionless position and momentum @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "<S> we show that quantum - interference phenomena can be realized for the dissipative nonlinear systems exhibiting hysteresis - cycle behavior and quantum chaos . </S>",
    "<S> such results are obtained for a driven dissipative nonlinear oscillator with time - dependent parameters and take place for the regimes of long time intervals exceeding dissipation time and for macroscopic levels of oscillatory excitation numbers . </S>",
    "<S> two schemas of time modulation : ( i ) periodic variation of the strength of the @xmath0 nonlinearity ; ( ii ) periodic modulation of the amplitude of the driving force , are considered . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are obtained within the framework of phase - space quantum distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the wigner functions of oscillatory mode in both bistable and chaotic regimes acquire negative values and interference patterns in parts of phase - space due to appropriately time - modulation of the oscillatory nonlinear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the time - modulation of the oscillatory parameters essentially improves the degree of sub - poissonian statistics of excitation numbers . </S>"
