    "it is possible to calculate the mixed ( modulation - curvaton ) perturbations when the curvaton perturbations are not negligible , however in the main part of this paper we have been focusing on the scenario in which modulation is dominating the cosmological perturbation .    in ref.@xcite , they have defined the non - linear formalism @xmath240 where the hypersurface defined by @xmath241 ( @xmath42 ) is modulated . in that case",
    "@xmath237 can not represent the usual curvature perturbation .",
    "( see fig.[fig : appendix2 ] . )      in our formalism , these quantities are corresponding to @xmath244 we thus find @xmath245 they also defined @xmath246 which gives the correspondence @xmath247 finally , they have defined the post - decay curvature perturbation @xmath248 which corresponds to @xmath249 in our calculation the curvature perturbation generated by the modulated decay is given by @xmath250 therefore , the correspondence is obvious between our calculation and ref.@xcite .    in finding the curvaton contribution they evaluated @xmath251 where the first and the last terms are originally given by @xmath252 where @xmath62 is defined previously in this paper .",
    "if the curvaton hypothesis is valid and the component perturbations are constant , one may evaluate the component perturbation at @xmath253 as @xmath254 where @xmath255 denotes the curvature perturbation just at the beginning of the oscillation . substituting the component perturbations ( defined at @xmath256 ) into the above equation ( [ above - eq ] ) , one will find @xmath257 although a deformation is needed , it is easy to find that the result is consistent with eq.([curv - appex ] ) .    using the above formula , they started perturbation with regard to the perturbation of @xmath258 .",
    "for instance , langlois and takahashi considered for the `` curvaton perturbation '' @xmath259 and for the `` inflaton perturbation '' @xmath260 these definitions are based on the usual curvaton hypothesis ( i.e , valid when one can disregard @xmath261 ) .      m.  sasaki and t.  tanaka , prog .",
