    "the thermodynamic framework for the characterization of multifractals @xcite has proved to be a useful and insightful tool for the analysis of many complex system problems in which this geometrical feature plays a prominent role in establishing physical behavior .",
    "this has clearly been the case of dynamical systems , turbulence , growth models , sand pile models , etc .",
    "@xcite . as it has recently been pointed out , multifractality is also of relevance to critical @xcite and glassy dynamics @xcite . in the former case",
    "the geometry of critical fluctuations is found to be multifractal and this has a hold on their dynamical properties @xcite , whereas in the latter case slow dynamics develops as phase - space accessibility is reduced and is finally confined to a multifractal subspace @xcite .",
    "concurrently , in the study of the same types of systems the nonextensive generalization of the boltzmann gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics @xcite , @xcite has recently raised much interest and provoked considerable debate @xcite as to whether there is firm evidence for its applicability in circumstances where a system is out of the range of validity of the canonical bg theory .",
    "slow dynamics is plausibly related to hindrance of movement in phase space that leads to ergodicity breakdown , and this in turn has been linked to the failure of bg statistics @xcite . here",
    "we briefly examine the relationship between multifractal properties and nonextensive dynamical evolution at the edge of chaos , a nonergodic state , in unimodal maps , as part of a wider analysis @xcite , that might contribute to reveal the physical source of the nonextensive statistics .",
    "an important class of multifractals are the strange attractors that are generated by iteration of nonlinear maps . amongst these , a prototypical example is the feigenbaum attractor , also known as the edge of chaos , generated by the logistic map , @xmath10,@xmath11 , when the control parameter @xmath12 takes the value @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently , the predictions of the nonextensive theory have been rigorously proved @xcite @xcite for this state that marks the transition from periodic to chaotic motion and that is characterized by the vanishing of the ordinary lyapunov exponent @xmath14 . at the edge of chaos ( and also at infinitely many other critical states of the same map such as the pitchfork and tangent bifurcations where @xmath15 @xcite ) the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the orbit position at time @xmath18 given the initial position @xmath19 at time @xmath20 ) generally acquires power law instead of exponential time dependence .",
    "the nonextensive formalism suggests @xcite that @xmath21 when @xmath15 obeys the @xmath9-exponential expression , @xmath22^{-1/(q-1 ) } , \\label{sensitivity}\\ ] ] containing the entropic index @xmath9 and the @xmath9-generalized lyapunov coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "the bg exponential form @xmath23 is recovered when @xmath24 .",
    "further , it was conjectured @xcite that the ordinary pesin identity @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) rate of entropy increase @xcite is replaced by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , @xmath18 large , and where @xmath29 is the tsallis entropy ( @xmath30 is the inverse of @xmath31 ) . in the limit @xmath24 @xmath32 becomes @xmath33 $ ] where @xmath34 . in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) @xmath35 is the probability distribution obtained from the relative frequencies with which the positions of an ensemble of trajectories occur within cells @xmath36 at iteration time @xmath18 .",
    "based on the renormalization group ( rg ) transformation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the feigenbaum s universal constant that measures the power - law period - doubling spreading of iterate positions , a rigorous analytical confirmation of eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity ] ) and also of @xmath39 have been obtained @xcite @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are simply given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand , a remarkable link between the well - known @xcite geometrical description of multifractals and the nonextensive statistics has been derived and corroborated numerically not only for the feigenbaum attractor but for the edge of chaos of the generalization of the logistic map to nonlinearity @xmath0 , @xmath42,@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this consists of the expression @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the extreme values of the generalized dimension spectrum @xmath4 , and correspond to the smallest and largest length scales of the multifractal set @xcite . for the @xmath47-logistic map one has @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( notice that @xmath50 depends on @xmath47 ) @xcite . in view of the clear association of the nonextensive statistics with the properties at the edge of chaos of the logistic map",
    "we have pursued the study of this critical state by means of the standard thermodynamic tools that characterize multifractals .",
    "here we advance some of the results we have found @xcite .",
    "we determine the index @xmath9 and the @xmath9-lyapunov coefficient @xmath8 at the edge of chaos of the @xmath47-logistic maps through direct evaluation of the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath1 . by making use of the properties @xcite @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the fixed - point map , @xmath54 , into the definition of @xmath1 , @xmath55 with the choice @xmath56 , and for iteration times of the form @xmath57",
    ", we obtain @xmath58",
    ". this result can be re - expressed as @xmath59^{-1/(q-1)},\\quad t=2^{n}-1,\\ ] ] with @xmath60    for details see ref .",
    "thus , without reference to the multifractal properties of the attractor , we have corroborated the result in eq .",
    "( [ tsallis ] ) @xcite and obtained additionally the @xmath9-lyapunov coefficient @xmath61 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath1 can be obtained from @xmath62 in the limit @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the distance between two orbits at time @xmath18 when they were a distance @xmath65 at @xmath20 . following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite with the choices @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath57 , @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "next we study a multifractal property of the attractor and make contact again with eq .",

    "notice the structure of horizontal bands , and that , in the top band lie half of the attractor positions ( odd times ) , in the second band a quarter of the attractor positions , and so on .",
    "the top band is eliminated by functional composition of the original map , that is by considering the orbit generated by the map @xmath78 instead of @xmath79 .",
    "successive bands are eliminated by considering the orbits of @xmath80 .",
    "the top band positions ( odd times ) can be reproduced approximately by the positions of the band below it ( times of the form @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) by multiplication of a factor equal to @xmath50 , e.g. @xmath83 .",
    "likewise , the positions of the second band are reproduced by the positions of the third band under multiplication by @xmath50 , e.g. @xmath84 , and so on . in fig .",

    "this time the positions in one band are reproduced approximately from the positions of the band lying below it by multiplication of a factor @xmath87 , e.g. @xmath88 .",
    "the scaling properties amongst iterate positions merely follow from repeated composition of the map ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and suggest the construction of an rg transformation described below . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to write the two scale factors @xmath50 and @xmath89 as @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "each position is used only once so that the set @xmath96 covers the attractor but not all the interval @xmath97 .",
    "to each length @xmath98 assign the equiprobability @xmath99 . following the standard procedure",
    "@xcite we define the partition function @xmath100^{\\beta } [ l_{j}^{(0)}]^{\\tau } ,   \\label{partition0}\\ ] ] and determine the ( finite size ) generalized dimensions @xmath101 by requiring @xmath102 , ( @xmath103 ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show results for @xmath104 for several values of @xmath47 .",
