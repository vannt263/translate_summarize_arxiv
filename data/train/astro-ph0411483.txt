    "it is not possible to measure a mass composition of primary cosmic rays ( pcr ) in the energy range @xmath0  ev using the direct method .",
    "nothing remains , but to resort to the indirect methods when for the similar estimates the measurement of different components of extensive air shower ( eas ) are used .",
    "that can be characteristics of longitudinal or lateral development of shower in the air .",
    "and usually it is connected with the analysis of the most sensitive to the composition of shower components which differ from each other by the character of formatting and absorbing in the atmosphere , for example , of the charged particle flux ( electron , muon ) , the flux of erenkov or ionization radiation .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] presents the eas yakutsk array experimental data and calculations by the model with the decelerated and moderate dissipation of the energy into the electromagnetic eas component : quasiscaling models ( solid line ) and qgsjet ( dashed line )  @xcite . from fig.[fig1 ] it is seen both the agreement of experimental data and calculations by qgsjet model ( proton ) in the region @xmath1  ev , and disagreement at @xmath2  ev .",
    "the scaling model gives a noticeably greater value of @xmath3 in relation to the experimental data that is doubtlessly also connected with the break of scaling function in the region of ultra ",
    "high energies .        the experimental data in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "is well approximated by the expression of a form : @xmath4 the relation ( [ eq1 ] ) is primarily important for the comparison of estimations of @xmath5 obtained at the yakutsk and fly s eye arrays  @xcite .",
    "the calculations in  @xcite ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) have been carried out by the qgsjet model in the case of primary proton and iron nucleus . a good agreement of our calculations in the case of the primary proton is observed .",
    "the comparison of experimental data with calculations for the proton and iron nucleus indicates to the fact that the mass composition of particles of cosmic radiation in the energy region of @xmath6  ev and above @xmath7  ev must differ . at @xmath1",
    "ev the mass composition is most likely close to the proton one .",
    "the showers with @xmath9  ev and zenith angles @xmath10 have been chosen .",
    "it is required so that the shower axis is within the array and not less than three muon detectors ( one of them is at a distance of 1000  m from the shower axis ) operate during the shower .",
    "the density of muons flux @xmath11 is like a median between the densities adjusted to @xmath12  m , according to a mean lateral muon distribution function . in this case",
    "the detectors which have been operated in the shower ( they have given zero indications ) , i.e. the detector threshold were used in analyze too .",
    "the muon flux densities at have distances of 300 and 600  m from the shower axis have been calculated in analogous way .",
    "results are in fig.[fig2]a and [ fig2]b",
    ". calculations  @xcite have shown that @xmath13 weekly depends on a zenith angle in the interval of @xmath14 .",
    "so for the comparison of calculations and experimental data we take a mean angle @xmath15 . in order to take into account both physical fluctuations in measurement of @xmath11 and methodical ones ( apparatus errors and accuracy of the locate of the shower axis ) we have considered the judicial interval in one @xmath16 . in fig.[fig2]a and [ fig2]b the calculation result",

    "a solid line shows the upper and lower limits for the case if eas with @xmath23  ev would generate by a primary @xmath24quantum .",
    "the calculation for the primary @xmath24quantum has been taken from  @xcite .",
    "dots for @xmath25 and circles for @xmath26 the experimental data show in fig.[fig2]a . in fig.[fig2]b the showers in the energy range of @xmath19  ev are shown by squares , the showers with @xmath23  ev are shown by dots and the showers of maximum energy are shown by triangles .",
    "the comparison of experimental data presented in fig.2a with calculations by the qgsjet model carried out for the case of the primary proton and iron nuclei confirms the hypothesis on the fact that the considerable portion of ultimate energy eas have been formed by protons .",
    "their portion decreases below the energy @xmath27  ev .",
    "it is seen from fig.2b , the basic mass of points ( showers with @xmath23  ev ) falls into the interval for the proton .",
    "23 points fall into a zone of superposition of a proton and iron nuclei and 19 showers from 116 fall into a zone of upper boundary of calculation for the primary @xmath24quantum .",
    "it testifies to the fact that even taking into account there exists a probability that showers of such energies can be generated by neutral particles and , in particular , by a primary @xmath24quantum .",
    "then it is justified to use the analysis of directions of arrival of showers with @xmath23  ev for the search of the sources of highest energy cosmic rays . in this case",
    "the determination accuracy of arrival angles of such showers must be not worse than @xmath28 .",
    "a large number of erenkov detectors operating in the individual eas events and also the use of a new version of the qgsjet model allow to obtain quantitative estimations of mass composition of pcr .",
    "for this aim we have compared experimental data ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) and theoretical predictions by the qgsjet model for different primary nucleus with the use of @xmath30 criterion .",
    "the value of @xmath30 has been determined by the equality @xmath31 ^ 2}{{n_{\\mathrm{theor}}}({x_{\\mathrm{max } } } ) } \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the experimental number of showers in the @xmath33 interval .",
    "@xmath34 is the analogous number of showers calculated under the assumption that the mass number of the nucleus is equal to @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the probability of the fact that the shower with the energy @xmath5 is formed by a primary particle @xmath35 .",
    "then : @xmath37    the analysis of form of the experimental distribution of @xmath29 at optimal value of @xmath30 with a definite portion of probability does nt contradict to the following relationship for five nuclei component :    @xmath38  ev : : :    p : @xmath39% , @xmath40 :    @xmath41% , m : @xmath42% , h :    @xmath43% , fe : @xmath44% ; @xmath45  ev : : :    p : @xmath46% , @xmath40 :    @xmath47% , m : @xmath48% , h :    @xmath49% , fe : @xmath50% ; @xmath51  ev : : :    p : @xmath52% , @xmath40 :    @xmath53% , m : @xmath54% , h :    @xmath44% , fe : @xmath55% .",
    "thus in the framework of the qgsjet model one can suppose that the mass composition of pcr changes transferring from the energy range @xmath56  ev to energy range @xmath57  ev .",
    "at @xmath1  ev the primary cosmic radiation consists from @xmath58% protons and helium nuclei , a portion of the rest nuclei in the range where there is the second irregularity in the energetic spectrum type `` ankle '' does nt exceed @xmath59% .",
    "a high content of proton and helium nuclei in pcr in the region of formation of `` ankle '' is most likely connected with an appreciable contribution into the overall flux of cosmic radiation in the earth s vicinity of radiation coming from beyond our galaxy limits .",
