    "the experimental realization of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in ultracold atoms @xcite has initiated substantial theoretical efforts to study its effects in 2d and 3d fermi gases @xcite .",
    "this is because soc systems with a zeeman field , which breaks the population balance , can lead to novel types of exotic superfluid phases that may support majorana fermions .",
    "@xcite    although the rashba so coupled atomic fermi gases in the free space have been extensively investigated , the entirely different case of attractive fermi gas in a square optical lattice with soc has not been completely studied.@xcite in what follows , we shall study a population - balanced mixture of fermion atoms with an s - wave pairing interaction loaded in a square two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical lattice , with rashba soc and an external out - of - plane zeeman field .",
    "we shall use a small zeeman field , because in this regime the pairing between atoms on the same fermi surface is preferred ; this is the normal bcs superfluid ( for a larger zeeman field , the topological bcs superfluid as well as the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov superfluid phases appear).@xcite      it is widely assumed that the two - body problem is the key to understanding the physics of so coupled fermi gases .",

    "therefore , in accordance with ref .",
    "[ ] , formation of the soc induced bound states takes place .",
    "the results in the previous section were obtained by applying the mean - field decoupling of the quartic term in the interaction part of the hamiltonian @xmath118 . to go beyond the mean - field approximation",
    ", we use the idea that one can transform the quartic terms into quadratic form by making the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ( hst ) for the fermion operators .",
    "in contrast to the previous approaches , such that after performing the hst the fermion degrees of freedom are integrated out ; we decouple the quartic problem by introducing a model system which consists of a multicomponent boson field @xmath119 interacting with fermion fields @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "there are three advantages of keeping both the fermion and the boson degrees of freedom .",
    "first , the approximation that is used to decouple the self - consistent relation between the fermion self - energy and the two - particle green s function , automatically leads to conserving approximations .",
    "this is because it relies on the fact that the bs kernel can be written as functional derivatives of the fock @xmath122 and the hartree @xmath123 self - energy @xmath124 .",
    "second , the collective excitations of the hubbard model can be calculated as poles of the fermion two - particle green s function , @xmath125 , and as poles of the green s function of the multicomponent boson field , @xmath126 .",
    "third , the action which describes the interactions in the hubbard model , is similar to the action @xmath127 in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "for this reason we can utilize powerful field - theoretical methods , such as the method of legendre transforms , to derive the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation of the boson green s function @xmath128 , the bs equation of the two - particle green s function , and the corresponding equation for the vertex function .",

    "<S> we investigate the single - particle and collective excitations of a rashba spin - orbit coupled atomic fermi gas with attractive interaction , loaded in a two dimensional ( 2d ) square optical lattice , in the presence of an effective out - of - plane zeeman field . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical calculations show that the many body physics of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) side is strongly modified compared to the fermi gases in the free space . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind this statement is in the fact that without a lattice structure , if the value of the zeeman field does not exceed some threshold value , the minimum of the single - particle ground state energy is infinitely degenerate and occurs along a ring in @xmath0 space . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the effective dimensionality ; the single - particle density of states is a constant at low energies , and the molecular pairing is strongly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the continuum , in the 2d lattice case there are only four degenerate minima , and because of that , the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in optical lattices gives rise to unusual properties entirely different from the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the continuum , the pairing gap as well as the condensate fraction are strongly enhanced by the soc strength on the bcs side . in the presence of lattice geometry the gap and the condensate fraction increase as a function of the soc strength only at the small fillings and weak attraction limit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that the speed of sound also exhibits different behavior : in the 3d and 2d continuum , the slope of the goldstone mode decreases as a function of the soc strength , while in the lattice case the speed of sound increases monotonically with soc strength . </S>"
