    "fisher s own view on fiducial inference evolved over the years as can be inferred from a reading of his initial [ fisher ( @xcite ) ] and more final formulation of the theory [ @xcite ] .",
    "he was in particular very positive to the developments by fraser ( @xcite ) , and we most certainly share this point of view .",
    "fraser ( @xcite ) develops the theory and uses the label _",
    "structural inference _ for this .",
    "a strongly related theory was presented under the label of _ functional models _ by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the term _ fiducial _ will here be used more generally so that it includes structural , functional , and the original fiducial arguments given by fisher .",
    "the original idea of fisher was to obtain the fiducial distribution directly from the cumulative distribution , but this line of argument runs into problems when similar arguments are tried in the multivariate case .",

    "it follows from this that an optimal equivariant rule , if it exists , is determined by the fiducial distribution of @xmath21 or by the distribution of @xmath26 from the right inverse .",
    "the first part of the claims in the abstract has hence been established .",
    "it is hoped that the reader can appreciate the simplicity and consequence of the calculation given in equation ( [ eqriskcalc ] ) , but it could also be considered to be essentially greek . the required theory of decisions and fiducial theory will be explained in some more detail in section  [ soptimal ] , and examples are presented in section  [ sexamples ] .",

    "it is here assumed that the model parameter @xmath32 is a @xmath4-finite random quantity and this and all other random quantities are defined based on the underlying conditional probability space @xmath33 as explained by @xcite .",
    "this means in particular that @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are measurable functions .",
    "it means also that all expectations that occur are defined by integration over @xmath37 . as an example @xmath38 by definition .",

    "the reason for the assumption of existence of @xmath32 , @xmath46 , and indeed any random quantity involved in the arguments , as functions defined on the conditional probability space @xmath47 is as in the formulation of probability theory given by @xcite : any collection of random quantities gives a new random quantity with a well - defined law , and measurable functions of random quantities give new random quantities .",
    "the theory is completely based on the underlying abstract space @xmath37 .    a _ group invariant problem _ is given by a group @xmath11 that has a transformation group action on the sample space @xmath3 , the model parameter space @xmath48 , and the action space @xmath49 .",
    "the problem is group invariant if @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "an inference rule @xmath52 with a corresponding action @xmath53 is _ equivariant _ if @xmath24 .",
    "the restriction to the class of equivariant actions can be interpreted as a consistency requirement : an observation @xmath54 from @xmath55 corresponds to an observation @xmath56 from @xmath57 .",
    "the two corresponding problems are formally identical and the use of an equivariant action ensures consistency .    the problem considered here is to determine an equivariant @xmath52 such that the risk @xmath58 is minimized .",
    "it will be assumed that @xmath59 with the action given by the group multiplication @xmath60 directly .",
    "the _ orbit _ of @xmath54 in @xmath3 is defined by @xmath61 , and likewise for orbits in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "it follows then that @xmath66 since the group invariance of the statistical model justifies @xmath67 .",

    "interesting examples where this occurs are discussed by @xcite in the form of dependence on shape parameters in addition to pure group parameters . in the following it will , however , be assumed throughout that the fiducial model is _ conventional _ in the sense that @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to notice that many different fiducial models are possible for a given statistical model .",
    "a fiducial model provides a different basis for statistical inference than a statistical model .",
    "the choice of a particular fiducial model can be compared with the choice of a bayesian prior together with a statistical model .",
    "fiducial inference is then initially different from frequentist and bayesian inference since the inferential basis is given by a fiducial model which is assumed known .",
    "fiducial inference as such will not be considered here , but the corresponding fiducial algorithms will be used as vehicles for the construction of frequentist procedures .",
    "a fiducial model @xmath70 is _ simple _ if the fiducial equation @xmath76 has a unique solution @xmath77 when solved for @xmath17 for all @xmath78 . in the simple and conventional case",

    "it follows then that @xmath83 is the unique solution of @xmath18 , and the fiducial distribution is the conditional distribution of @xmath84 as it appears in equation ( [ eqqfid ] )",
    ".    the remainder of this section will be on the analysis of the group model by means of the constructed fiducial model given by equation ( [ eqgroupmod ] ) in the case where @xmath3 is not assumed to be a principal homogeneous space for @xmath11 .",
    "the aim is to determine an equivariant inference rule @xmath52 so that the risk given by equation ( [ eqrisk ] ) is minimized .",
    "a definition of a fiducial distribution will also be presented for this group case .",
    "the resulting distribution coincides with the distribution described with many more examples , explicit calculation of densities , and illustrative figures by fraser ( @xcite ) .",
    "a first observation is that the calculations given by equations ( [ eqrisk1])([eqrisk4 ] ) are valid and the risk is given by @xmath85 .",
    "the construction of the fiducial model has hence given a simple proof that gives that the risk does not depend on the model parameter since @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath17 .",

    "this @xmath96 will be unique if @xmath11 acts freely on @xmath3 , but here it will more generally be assumed that @xmath96 is determined by the choice of a measurable selection .",

    "this result can be summarized as the main technical result in this paper .",
    "[ theo1 ] the risk of an equivariant rule in a group invariant problem is determined by a fiducial distribution if the model parameter space is a principal homogeneous space for the group .",

    "theorem  [ theo1 ] generalizes directly to the larger class of randomized equivariant actions .",
    "this is obtained by a replacement of the equivariant action @xmath105 by the randomized equivariant action @xmath106 in the calculations .",

    "the equivariance is defined by the identity @xmath109 .",
    "a randomized action corresponds to the assignment of a probability measure on the action space @xmath49 .",
    "the set of randomized actions is hence always a convex set , and this gives theoretical advantages to the problem of minimization of the risk .",
    "if , however , the loss function @xmath110 is convex on @xmath49 for each @xmath17 , then the jensen inequality gives that it is sufficient to consider nonrandom actions [ @xcite , page 48 ] .",
    "theorem  [ theo1 ] generalizes also directly to the case where @xmath11 is only assumed to act transitively on @xmath48 .",
    "the construction is as above , and starts with fixing a @xmath111 and the construction of a random variable @xmath64 such that @xmath112 .",
    "all the arguments given above can then be repeated with @xmath11 playing the role of a new and possibly larger parameter space .",
    "the result is then first a fiducial distribution on @xmath11 , but this is pushed forward to a fiducial distribution on @xmath48 by the mapping @xmath113 .",
    "it is known that the fiducial coincides with the posterior from a right haar prior , and for these cases theorem  [ theo1 ] is a known result with the posterior used in the formulation instead .",
    "there are , however , groups where no haar prior exists , and in this case theorem  [ theo1 ] and its extensions given by the above comments is a novel result .",
    "the derivation given in the also gives a similar result in the more general case of a quasi - group , and the existence of invariant measures is then also not automatic .",
    "the examples presented next are chosen to illustrate the concepts . many more examples and thorough discussions are found in the previously quoted textbooks and monographs . a complete treatment of the given examples  including in particular simulation studies of the resulting procedures  will not be pursued since this would tend to take attention away from the main issue .",
    "the purpose is simply to indicate the usefulness of fiducial theory .      a random sample of size n from the bernoulli distribution provides an example where the results related to theorem  [ theo1 ] can not be applied directly .",

    "the conclusion is that conditioning on the maximal invariant as in the arguments leading to theorem  [ theo1 ] does not provide any essential simplification of the problem .",
    "this example is , however , very important from the point of view that fiducial distributions can still provide optimal procedures .",

    "the empirical mean is the unbiased estimator of @xmath118 with minimum variance .",
    "it can , however , be argued that neither unbiasedness nor minimum variance are natural concepts in this particular case .",
    "the parameter space @xmath48 can alternatively be identified with the circular arc @xmath119 in the @xmath120-plane .",
    "this has the advantage that the fisher information metric distance between two distributions in this parametric family equals the distance along the arc [ @xcite ] .",
    "the distance squared provides a loss that is invariant with respect to @xmath11 .",

    "repeated application of the construction gives then next the quaternions @xmath127 and then next the octonions @xmath128 . the octonions is hence equal to the @xmath129-dimensional vector space @xmath130 equipped with a particular multiplication operation so that @xmath128 is an algebra [ @xcite ] .",

    "the prototypical example used by fisher [ ( @xcite ) , page 534 ] when he introduced the fiducial distribution is given by the sample correlation coefficient from a bivariate normal distribution .",
    "in this case , a reduction to a group model as for the given elementary examples is not possible .    in the general case starting from the property @xmath150 there exists , however , a change of variables that results in a relation given by a quasi - group with a unit : a loop .",
    "the important conclusion of this short discussion is that the theory of simple pivotal models is linked naturally to the theory of loops .",
    "the nonzero octonions provides an example of a loop which is not reducible to a group by a change of variables .",
    "one purpose of this example is to demonstrate existence of a case where theorem  [ theo1 ] can be used , but where an invariant measure does not exist .",

    "more important is the fact that a right haar prior does not exist in the case where @xmath11 is an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "an explicit example is given by @xmath170 .",
    "the previous example has an infinite - dimensional parameter space , and this feature is quite common in applications as exemplified by nonparametric statistics . the example does also include data that are infinite dimensional , and this can be considered to be unrealistic in applications .",

    "an important source of examples is given by the statistical signal processing literature [ @xcite ] .",

    "similarly , it can be convenient to assume that a complete infinite sequence of sampled points is observed , even though only a finite number of samples are actually observed . in both cases",
    "this can lead to a sample space that is not finite dimensional .",
    "a related and very common convenience is to assume that observations are given by real numbers , even though the majority of concrete examples actually only involves a finite set of observable values due to limited instrument resolution [ @xcite ] .",
    "explicit consideration of the limit from discretized data to continuous data gives , incidentally , a most promising route for the definition of fiducial distributions more generally than considered in section  [ soptimal ] as demonstrated recently by @xcite .",
    "if one observes the real random variables @xmath171 independently normally distributed with unknown mean @xmath172 and variance @xmath131 , it is customary to estimate @xmath173 by @xmath174 . if the loss is the sum of squares of the errors , this estimator is admissible for @xmath175 , but inadmissible for @xmath176 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the optimal estimator derived above coincides with the customary estimator .",
    "this exemplifies that the optimal estimator can be inadmissible .",
    "the optimality is only ensured within the class of equivariant estimators .",
    "equivariance can be a most natural demand , but this depends on the particular concrete modeling case at hand .",
    "in certain situations [ @xcite ] it can be natural to give away the equivariance demand in order to obtain more precise estimates .",
    "in other cases , especially in the context of physics , the equivariance demand can be closer to the foundation of the subject matter and will be an absolute demand .      a particular case of the previous hilbert space example is given by assuming @xmath177 and where @xmath20 corresponds to a random sample of size @xmath178 from the uniform distribution on @xmath179 .",
    "this gives then a fiducial model for a random sample from the uniform distribution on @xmath180 .",

    "the model is also a special case of the hilbert space example with @xmath186 and where @xmath169 are conditionally dependent given @xmath187 .",
    "reduction by sufficiency has here simplified the problem , but the fiducial equation is still over determined so a further reduction by the maximal invariant @xmath188 is necessary . the resulting conditional distribution @xmath189 becomes the uniform distribution on @xmath190 , and the fiducial distribution of @xmath21 becomes the uniform distribution on @xmath191 .",
    "this is also a confidence distribution for @xmath17 .",
    "the optimal estimator for @xmath17 given the invariant loss @xmath192 is @xmath193 .",

    "this curve is continuous , but the length from @xmath195 to @xmath196 is infinite : it is larger than @xmath197 for any integer @xmath178 .",
    "the squared distance @xmath198 is the squared distance from the fisher information metric for any location family where the density is smooth .",
    "based on this we consider the invariant loss @xmath192 to be a natural choice also in the nonsmooth example considered here .",
    "the optimal estimator @xmath52 found above is unbiased and has hence minimum variance in the class of unbiased and equivariant estimators .",
    "nonetheless , according to lehmann and casella [ ( @xcite ) , page 87 ] , there exists no uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of @xmath17 .",
    "the statistic @xmath199 is a minimal sufficient statistic , but it is not complete .",

    "this later reference is also a very good source for further references and peculiarities regarding the uniform law.=-1      the following example is a scale example , and can be reduced to be a special case of the hilbert space location problem by the logarithmic transformation .",

    "this follows from well - known properties of the gamma distribution .",
    "the model is both simple and conventional , and the fiducial distribution for an observation @xmath208 is hence the conditional distribution of @xmath209 .",
    "the conclusion is that the fiducial distribution is the inverse - gamma with scale @xmath210 and shape @xmath178 .    a direct  but more lengthy  calculation of the bayesian posterior corresponding to the right haar prior @xmath211 gives a posterior that coincides with the fiducial distribution found here .",
    "it is well known more generally that the bayesian posterior from a right haar prior in a group model coincides with the fiducial .",

    "the loss is equivariant , and it follows that the optimal rule @xmath52 based on the sufficient statistic @xmath46 is given as the minimizer of @xmath222 .",

    "inferential model _ is essentially the same as a _ conventional fiducial model _ as summarized in the previous paragraphs .",
    "the dempster  shafer calculus gives an alternative route for inference based on a fiducial model , but this is not discussed further here .",
    "the discussion of fiducial theory we have presented is close to the presentation given by @xcite .",
    "dawid and stone [ ( @xcite ) , page 1055 ] use the term _ fiducial model _ for the combination of @xmath79 and @xmath264 , and use the term _ functional model _ to describe the more general relation @xmath263 .",

    "@xcite uses the term _ structural equation _ in stead of the term _ fiducial equation _ as used by us .",
    "we have avoided the term _ structural _ here since there is an active and well - developed different theory which goes under the label of _ structural equations modeling_. our preference for the term _ fiducial _ as used here is mainly based on economy of language , and since this gives the direct link to the original papers of fisher .",
    "the mathematically inclined reader may claim that definition  [ deffidmod ] is not precise .",
    "this , and the fact that this definition is a novelty compared with previous writers , motivate us to state in more detail the assumptions that are taken as implicitly given from the context in the statement of definition  [ deffidmod ] .",
    "the main difference is that every concept is based on an underlying abstract conditional probability space @xmath33 as stated initially in section  [ soptimal ] .",
    "the fiducial relation @xmath257 is a measurable function @xmath71 .",
    "this means , as usual , that @xmath266 is a measurable set in the product @xmath4-algebra of @xmath267 whenever @xmath65 is a measurable set in @xmath268 .",
    "a consequence is that @xmath269 is a random element in @xmath268 defined by the mapping @xmath270 .",
    "this is measurable since it is assumed that @xmath36 and @xmath271 are measurable .",
    "the conditional law @xmath20 of the monte carlo variable @xmath64 is known and does not depend on @xmath17 in the case of a conventional fiducial model .",
    "if the considerations were limited to the case where @xmath33 is a probability space , then this would imply @xmath272 .",
    "this fails generally as explained in more detail by @xcite since @xmath20 is a probability measure , but @xmath273 is unbounded if @xmath274 is unbounded .",
    "the reason for allowing unbounded measures is the need to include improper priors @xmath45 .",
    "this has proved fruitful in related ongoing research by the authors .",
    "it gives in particular natural conditions that imply equality of bayesian posteriors and fiducial distributions . in specific modeling cases",
    "the spaces @xmath275 , @xmath268 , @xmath48 , the fiducial relation @xmath257 , and the conditional law @xmath20 are all explicitly given .",
    "this is as demonstrated by the examples in section  [ sexamples ] .",
    "the other ingredients mentioned above are not given explicitly since they rely on the underlying unspecified space @xmath37 .",
    "this is as in the ordinary formulation of probability theory by @xcite where the whole theory is built upon the underlying abstract space @xmath37 .",
    "existence must be proved in each specific modeling case , but follows trivially in many cases from the construction of a suitable product space .",
    "optimal inference for the scale , the location , and the location - scale problems were investigated using fiducial theory by @xcite .",
    "his presentation is most readable and is a good alternative to the presentations found in standard textbooks .",
    "it can , however , be noted that he concludes that the confidence and the fiducial theories are essentially the same .",
    "this is in contrast to the views of neyman and fisher .",
    "they seemed to agree that in principle the fiducial distribution as described by fisher is not connected to the concept of confidence intervals as described by neyman and co - workers .",
    "the content and aims of these two theories are different .",
    "it seems clear that fisher never intended to get confidence intervals as the result of his fiducial arguments .",
    "it is true that the fiducial distributions found in the location - scale problems , and more general group problem as in theorem  [ theo1 ] , are confidence distributions , but we do consider the concepts to be essentially different in general .",
    "the interpretation of the fiducial distribution , according to fisher [ ( @xcite ) , pages 54 and 59 ] is identical with the interpretation of the bayesian posterior : it represents the state of knowledge regarding the model parameter as a result of the model assumptions and the observation in the experiment .",
    "it follows then in particular that the fiducial distribution of a function @xmath276 of the model parameter @xmath17 equals the distribution of @xmath277 where @xmath21 has the fiducial distribution .",
    "this property does not hold for confidence distributions in general .",
    "in addition , the fiducial distribution for a simple fiducial model as in definition  [ deffid1 ] is not a confidence distribution in general [ @xcite ] .",
    "the possibly most famous fiducial distribution is the fiducial distribution of the difference of means @xmath278 corresponding to two independent samples from two different normal distributions .",
    "this fiducial distribution gives fisher s solution to the behrens  fisher problem , but it can be shown by simulation that it is not a confidence distribution in the sense of having exact coverage probabilities .",
    "a more general class of confidence distributions is defined by requiring not exact but conservative coverage probabilities .",
    "this is in conformity with the definition of confidence sets in general .",
    "exactness is often misguidedly taken as a measure of goodness , but it is not .",
    "power of the associated tests gives one natural measure of goodness .",
    "examples demonstrate that this more general concept of a confidence distribution does not coincide with fiducial distributions in general , but it seems to be an open question whether the behrens  fisher fiducial distribution is a confidence distribution in this more extended sense .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the claim holds [ @xcite , page 269 ] .",
    "the more general problem of obtaining a confidence interval for the linear combination of several means from different normal distributions is of considerable practical importance [ @xcite ] .",
    "the iso recommended solution is in terms of a welch ",
    "satterthwaite solution , but a continuation of the arguments given by @xcite leads to the conclusion that the fiducial solution is a most competitive alternative solution .",
    "the main virtue of the location - scale models in the context here is that they illustrate very well the reduction given by a maximal invariant in cases where a reduction by sufficiency is not possible .",
    "this is also true for the multivariate models treated by @xcite . in this case",
    "the multivariate normal can be reduced by sufficiency , but more general models can again be treated by a reduction through maximal invariants .",
    "it seems that optimal , or good , inference procedures in these multivariate cases deserves further study guided by fiducial theory .",
    "a recent example of this is given by @xcite , but there are a multitude of different possible examples as indicated by @xcite .",
    "the suggestion given by theorem  [ theo1 ] is that not only confidence intervals , but also other kinds of inference such as estimation should be considered .",
    "eaton [ ( @xcite ) , pages 8991 ] considers the estimation of the covariance matrix from a multivariate normal sample .",
    "he gives two possible candidates to use as a loss @xmath279 .",
    "this exemplifies that in the multivariate cases , and in more complicated group cases , it can be difficult to decide upon which equivariant loss to use .",
    "it can even be difficult to come up with a good candidate . in our examples",
    ", it has been indicated that the squared distance from the fisher information metric is a natural choice",
    ". this will be invariant under mild conditions .",
    "for a statistical model @xmath280 , the distance is defined via the length of paths @xmath281 in the hilbert space @xmath282 . the nonparametric case given by a parameter space equal to all densities with respect to @xmath261",
    "gives the distance @xmath283 .",
    "the other end of the scale is given by a smooth finite - dimensional parametric model .",
    "in this case , the previous leads to the fisher information metric : @xmath284 where @xmath285 . in either case",
    ", it gives the model parameter space as a manifold equipped with a distance derived intrinsically from the statistical model .",
    "the focus of fiducial theory has initially and currently most often been on the fiducial distribution by itself and the related possibility of construction of approximate or exact confidence intervals . the relation to other kinds of optimal inference such as estimation or prediction",
    "was considered by hora and buehler ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proofs they presented rely on the existence of an invariant measure , and it was clear that the fiducial in the case they considered corresponded to a bayesian posterior from the right haar prior . since then it has been established in a variety of problems that the bayesian algorithm can be used quite generally to obtain good or optimal frequentist procedures .",
    "the calculation given in equation ( [ eqriskcalc ] ) can be taken as a strong indication that the fiducial algorithm can be used similarly to not only obtain confidence intervals , but also possibly good or optimal frequentist procedures more generally .",
    "this statement is too general to be provable , but we consider nonetheless this to be the main content and message in this paper .",
    "the point of view in this paper does not rely on any particular interpretation of the fiducial .",
    "it is here simply viewed as a very convenient vehicle for the derivation of good , and sometimes optimal as in theorem  [ theo1 ] , frequentist inference procedures .",
