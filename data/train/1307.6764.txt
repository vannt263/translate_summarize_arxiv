    "the study of qcd in the nonperturbative regime is a highly interesting topic .",
    "important features of qcd , such as confinement or the qcd phase diagram , can not be described through a perturbative analysis of the theory .",
    "because of this , several methods have been developed in order to deal with the nonperturbative sector , such as lattice qcd .",
    "however succesful , lattice qcd does not seem to be an appropiate tool for studying problems with finite baryon chemical potential because of the well known `` sign problem '' @xcite .",
    "another method frequently used to study the nonperturbative sector of qcd , is the use of effective models such as the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "this was originally developed as a model of interacting nucleons @xcite , however , nowadays it is vastly used as a model of interacting quarks to explore finite temperature and density effects @xcite .",
    "+ the nonlocal njl ( nnjl ) model is a generalization of the njl model @xcite .",
    "the model has a nonlocal interaction modulated by a regulator .",
    "this regulator can take a variety of forms , inspired by different models @xcite .",
    "+ in the last years , some regulators were proposed in order to reproduce lattice simulations of the light quarks propagator @xcite .",
    "two regulators are associated with the renormalization function and self - energy .",
    "these kind of regulators are interesting due to their analytic structure .",
    "they exhibit a cut in the complex plane , which is one of the features we are interested in treating the system in a real time formalism @xcite .",
    "we want to study the effects of these kind of regulators in the presence of temperature and density effects .",
    "+ temperature and chemical potential effects are usually introduced in the nnjl model through the matsubara ( imaginary time ) formalism @xcite . however , in this case the sums of matsubara frequencies are an issue because of the complicated shape the regulators may have . a real time formalism was initially proposed to avoid the necesity of truncating the matsubara frequencies in numerical calculations .",
    "this formalism provides a description of the effective quarks which we find to be quite insightful , since it provides us with a clear intepretation of confinement effects @xcite .",
    "the main purpose behind working with the real time formalism in such kind of effective models is to achieve a description of the system in terms of quasiparticles .",
    "the resulting quasiparticles will be expressed in terms of a mass and a decay width , allowing us to understand which of them will be relevant for the description of the system , and which not .",
    "those too massive will be not accesible , and particles with a big decay width are too unstable .",
    "this is the case indeed when dealing with the high temperature regime , with a lorentzian regulator , where only a few number of poles contribute to the dynamics of the system , unlike the gaussian regulator case @xcite .",
    "real time formalism is also interesting since it allows us to study phenomena beyond thermodynamic equilibrium through the schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite .",
    "the use of a lorentzian regulator has the advantage of generating a finite number of poles , contrary to the case of the gaussian regulator @xcite .",
    "this fact softens the instabilities generated by the truncation of the pole series at low temperature @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we will develop the real time formalism for a nnjl model with a fractional lorentzian regulator , which produces a cut in the complex plane , exhibiting a propagator with only complex poles .",
    "we will get the behavior of the masses of the quasiparticles as a function of the vacuum expectation value of a scalar bosonic field and we will look for a critical temperature at which chiral symmetry is restored in the chiral limit .",
