    "ultra - cold atomic gases have provided us with novel physical systems that exhibit all genuine many - body phenomena known from traditional condensed matter physics and , still , admit all the superior coherent control tools used in quantum optics .",
    "after the experimental realization of bec itself , tremendous efforts were focused on the creation of topological and solitary excitations of condensates ( for a current review see ref .",
    "especially alternative methods for the creation of vortices have stirred the minds , as the traditional `` rotating - the - squeezed - bucket '' procedure was not successful , initially .",
    "thus , the first fruitful proposal to create a vortex involved a rapidly rotating gaussian laser beam entangling the external motion with internal state rabi - oscillations @xcite .",
    "later , condensates were stirred up mechanically @xcite and evaporative spin - up techniques created vorticity @xcite and recently giant vortices @xcite could be created . due to larger asymmetries in the trapping potentials that can be achieved nowadays ,",
    "vortices are now predominantly created with the stirring method and fascinating abrikosov lattices containing up to 300 vortices have been made @xcite .",
    "alternatively , prospects for creating vortices by optical phase imprinting @xcite were investigated ( in analogy to the successful soliton experiment @xcite ) and applying magnetic interactions were considered @xcite",
    ". moreover , there have been ideas to create vorticity by sweeping a laser beam on a spiraling trajectory across the trap , inducing a landau - zener transition between the irrotational and the rotational state @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , the transfer of angular momentum from an optical field to a macroscopic rigid body or an atomic particle has also a long standing tradition in quantum mechanics . the first proof that circularly polarized light carries angular momentum dates back to beth s original experiment of 1936 @xcite .",
    "more recently , due to the availability of gauss - laguerre laser beams with well defined external angular momentum @xcite it is possible to use them as optical tweezers and twisters @xcite . surprisingly , even the transfer of angular momentum to ultra - sonic waves in fluids can be achieved that way @xcite . in the context of a bec , using the angular momentum of light to create a doubly charged vortex has been proposed @xcite , @xmath1-pulses in raman type transitions were examined @xcite and an adiabatic passage to a vortex state was investigated by changing the two - photon detuning of an effective two - level system @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will examine the transfer of external angular momentum of light to the matter wave with the help of a stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "the basic effect relies on a quantum mechanical interference between two ground states and gives rise to a multitude of physical phenomena , e.g. , dark resonances in optical spectroscopy @xcite , velocity selective coherent population trapping ( vscpt ) @xcite , a drastic modification of the optical index of refraction ( eit ) of normal @xcite and be condensed systems @xcite , as well as constructive procedures to prepare @xcite and readout quantum states of atomic beams and optical cavities @xcite .",
