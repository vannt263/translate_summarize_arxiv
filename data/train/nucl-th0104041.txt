    "relativistic hydrodynamics provides a link between the equation of state(eos ) of the excited nuclear matter and collective observables such as elliptic flow(@xmath0-s ) and radial flow(@xmath1-s ) . at the sps",
    ", pure hydrodynamics calculations can fit the transverse mass spectra for almost any eos by choosing the freezeout temperature @xmath2 .",
    "however in non - central collisions , when @xmath0 was calculated for these same eoss with the same @xmath2-s , @xmath3 was above the data by a factor of two@xcite .",
    "bass and dumitru@xcite removed the @xmath2 indeterminacy by injecting the particles into a microscopic transport model at a switching temperature @xmath4 , and cascading the particles until they decoupled . with",
    "the freezeout parameter removed , the slope parameters for central pbpb collisions were calculated and found to agree with experimental values .",
    "the only parameter in this approach is the total multiplicity in the collision .    later , elliptic flow was calculated@xcite in a similar hydro+cascade model and @xmath3 was only 20% above the data .",
    "since at freezeout the viscosity is certainly important , it was not surprising that the introduction of a cascade reduced the elliptic flow .",
    "it @xmath5 surprising that hydro+cascade could simultaneously reproduce the elliptic @xmath6 radial flow for different particle species as a function of impact parameter .",
    "furthermore , the combined analysis of radial and elliptic flow restricted possible eoss since the freezeout temperature could no longer be adjusted to make any eos fit any slope parameter .",
    "roughly speaking , a soft eos produced too little radial flow while a hard eos produced too much elliptic flow .",
    "now , with the eos roughly fixed from available sps data , parameter free predictions were made for rhic .",
    "a few of these predictions are : ( a ) an increase in @xmath3 by approximately 40% over the sps and ( b ) a significant increase in the radial flow .",
    "( c ) curved nucleon @xmath7 spectra .",
    "the preliminary data reported in this conference have been in agreement with these predictions .",
    "ideally , the cascade should provide a kind of dual description of the hydrodynamics . although @xmath8 provides a natural place to switch to the cascade , the results ( slope parameters and @xmath3-s , lifetimes , etc . )",
    "should be insensitive to the switching temperature @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , bass and dumitru@xcite reported that the results were sensitive to the transition surface . by incorporating chemical freezeout into the hydrodynamic calculation , the sensitivity to @xmath9",
    "was much reduced although the elliptic flow at the sps remained sensitive to @xmath9@xcite .",
    "if the preliminary data remain unchanged and further predictions are verified , the hydrodynamic description must be taken seriously and the equilibration times and transport cross sections estimated from binary , perturbative , classical parton cascades must be considered only a very coarse guide to the radiating , non - perturbative , quantum glue that makes up the initial state .",
