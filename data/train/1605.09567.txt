    "* kahn & woltjer ( 1959 ) ) argued that dark matter has to be present in the local group .",

    "* van de hulst , raimond & van woerden ( 1957 ) ) hinted at high mass - to - light ratio material in the outer parts , but the data were as yet uncertain . in the 1970s ,",
    "dark matter around spiral galaxies became a subject in itself , thanks in part to hi studies in other galaxies .",
    "this has been reviewed often , so here i only mention some early data on large hi outskirts .",
    "* rogstad , lockhart & wright ( 1974 ) ) found a large outer hi envelope in m83 , and modelled it with a tilted ring model where the outer rings were not in the same plane as the inner disk .",

    "the warp was modelled with tilted rings , now using the circular velocity in each ring as a free parameter . since ngc 2841",
    "does not have an obvious companion , it was concluded that the warp was not due to tidal interaction , as for ngc 5907 and ngc 4565 . for ngc 5055 , the extended hi disk was also found to be warped , but on a deep iiiaj image there is a irregular patch of optical emission in the galaxy outskirts ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the question then shifted from  is dark matter present ? `` to ' ' how much of it is there , and what is its distribution ? \" .",
    "this led to the formulation of the disk - halo degeneracy problem ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van albada & sancisi 1986 ) ) , which states that there is no tight constraint on the mass - to - light ratio of the disk ( now taken constant as function of radius ) .",
    "further constraints come from dynamical arguments , e.g. the ability of a galactic disk to amplify two - armed spiral structure with the swing amplifier mechanism ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* athanassoula , bosma & papaioannou 1987 ) ) , leading to a range of m / l values ( in figure 1 a maximum disk is used ) .",
    "other constraints have been used , such as spiral structure models ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* weiner , sellwood & williams 2001 ) ) .",
    "most studies agree that for large , high surface brightness galaxies the disk is near maximum , for smaller , lower surface brightness galaxies the disk becomes sub maximum , and for dwarf disk galaxies the dark matter dominates in the inner parts .",

    "this has been further quantified recently by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* anyian et al . ( 2016 ) ) , who use colour - magnitude diagrams to strengthen the argument . in figure 2",
    "i take their argument further : i plot cmds in the blue ( b vs. b - v ) , near infrared ( i vs. v - i ) and further in the infrared ( k vs. j - k ) , to show that it can be expected that , if the young stellar populations really have a significant effect on the velocity dispersions , it matters in which wavelength region the data are taken : ( slightly ) higher velocity dispersions should be found for data taken in the caii region ( @xmath0 @xmath1 8500  ) compared to the mgi region ( @xmath0 @xmath1 5175  ) .",
