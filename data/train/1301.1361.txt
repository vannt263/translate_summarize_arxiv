    "when constructing a physical theory , there is a large freedom in the choice of the mathematical structures .",
    "the developments of theoretical physics taught us that some of these structures are well - suited to describe some classes of phenomena ( e.g. the use of a vector field for electromagnetism , of spinors for some class of particles , the use of some symmetries , etc . ) .",
    "however , these choices can only be validated by the mathematical consistency of the theory and the agreement between the consequences of these structures and experiments .",
    "it may even be that different structures are possible to reproduce what we know about physics and one may choose one over the other on the basis of less well - defined criteria such as simplicity and economy .    at each step , some properties such as the topology of space  @xcite , the number of spatial dimensions or the numerical values of the free parameters that are the fundamental constants  @xcite , may remain a priori free in a given framework , or imposed in another framework ( e.g. the number of space dimensions is fixed in string theory  @xcite ) .    among all these structures , and in the framework of metric theories of gravitation ,",
    "the signature of the metric is in principle arbitrary .",
    "indeed , it seems that on the scales that have been probed so far there is the need for only one time dimension and three spatial dimensions . in special and general relativity , time and space",
    "are geometrically different because the geometry of spacetime is locally minkowskian , i.e. it enjoys a lorentzian metric with signature @xmath0 , i.e. the line element is @xmath1 .",
    "while the existence of two time directions may lead to confusion  @xcite , it is not clear if there are theoretical obstacles to have more than one time directions , as even suggested by some framework  @xcite ( see the argument for such possibilities made by ref .",
    "@xcite and detailed further in ref .",
    "several models for the birth of the universe  @xcite are based on a change of signature via an instanton in which a riemannian and a lorentzian manifolds are joined across a hypersurface which may be thought of as the origin of time .",
    "while there is no time in the euclidean region , where the signature is @xmath2 , it flips to @xmath0 .",
    "eddington even suggested  @xcite that it can flip across some surface to @xmath3 .",
    "signature flip also arises in brane - world scenarios  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of these possibilities ) or in loop quantum cosmology  @xcite .",
    "these discussions however let the problem of the origin of the time direction open  @xcite .    in newtonian theory ,",
    "time is a fundamental concept .",
    "it is assumed to flow and is described by a real variable .",
    "it can be measured by good clocks and any observers shall , irrespective of their motion , agree on the time elapsed between two events  @xcite .",
    "the laws of dynamics describe the change of configurations of a system with time . in relativity ,",
    "first the notions of space and time are set on the same footing and second , the notion of time is no more unique .",
    "one has to distinguish between a coordinate time , with no physical meaning , and the proper time that can be measured by an observer .",
    "quantum mechanics offers another insight on time : there , while there may be operators or observables corresponding to spatial positions , time is not an observable , and thus not an operator  @xcite . as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by an argument going back to pauli , commutation relations like @xmath4=i\\delta^\\mu_\\nu$ ] are incompatible with the spectrum of @xmath5 lying in the future lightcone and the notion of time is intimately related to the complex ( hilbert space ) structure of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the question of whether time does actually `` exist '' has been widely debated in the context of classical physics  @xcite , relativity  @xcite and quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the debate on the nature of time has shifted with quantum gravity where the recovery of a classical notion of time is considered as a problem . in that case , the schrdinger equation becomes the wheeler - de witt equation , of the form @xmath6 , so that the allowed states are those for which the hamiltonian vanishes .",
    "thus , it determines in which states the universe can be but does not give any evolution through time .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for general discussions on the nature of time .",
    "this has led to numerous works on the emergence of time in different versions of quantum gravity  @xcite ( and indeed the reverse opinion has been argued  @xcite ) . also , the thermodynamical aspects of gravity , the existence of dualities between gauge theories and gravity theories  @xcite , and holography  @xcite have led to the idea that the metric itself may have to be thought of as the result of a coarse - graining of underlying more fundamental degrees of freedom  @xcite .    the local minkowski structure is an efficient way to implement the notion of causality in realistic theories and is today accepted as a central ingredient of the construction of the relativistic theory of fields .",
    "when gravity is included , the equivalence principle implies ( this is not a theoretical requirement , but just an experimental fact , required at a given accuracy ) that all the fields are universally coupled to the same lorentzian metric . from the previous discussion , we may wonder whether the signature of this metric is only a convenient way to implement causality or whether it is just a property of an effective description of a microscopic theory in which there is no such notion .",
    "this article proposes the view according to which the fundamental physical theory is intrinsically purely euclidean so that its field equations determine a static 4-dimensional field configuration .",
    "the lorentzian dynamics that we can observe in our universe has then to be thought of as an emergent property , that is as an illusion holding in a small patch of a euclidean mathematical space .",
    "this is thus an attempt to go further than early proposals  @xcite and see to which extent this can be an open possibility .",
    "we emphasize that it is different from the models discussed above involving a signature change across a boundary or obtained by rotating to an euclidean space .",
    "we consider it important to take the freedom to see how far one can go in such a direction .",
    "as we shall later discuss , if possible , such a setting may shed a new light on several theoretical issues from the nature of singularities to quantum gravity .",
    "our attitude is however more modest and we want to start by constructing a decent classical field theory under this hypothesis",
    ". section  [ sec2 ] explains the basics of our mechanism and then describes the construction of the scalar , vector and spinor sectors in flat spacetime .",
    "we show that the whole standard model of particle physics can be constructed from a euclidean theory , at the classical level .",

    "while general relativity is not recovered in general , it shows that an extended @xmath7-essence theory of gravity called covariant galileon can be obtained .",

    "we then discuss the experimental and theoretical constraint on our construction in   [ sec5 ] and also propose a way to understand phenomenologically the emergence of the effective lorentzian dynamics .",

    "we finish by pointing out the properties and limits of this mechanism in   [ subsec2.5 ] , many of them being discussed in a more realistic version in the following sections .      in order to understand the basics of our model ,",

    "indeed this direction does not preexist at the microscopic level and can be different from patches to patches . ]      the euclidean configuration of a scalar field @xmath29 can be obtained by combining the usual action for a scalar field , with a kinetic term and a potential , @xmath30,\\ ] ] with a coupling to the clock field @xmath11 as @xmath31 let us consider the action obtained by the following combination @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to conclude that since @xmath33 and , when restricted to @xmath12 , @xmath34 , the action  ( [ e.chi1 ] ) reduces to @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xmath12 .",

    "the apparent lorentzian dynamics , with a preferred time direction , is thus the result of the coupling to the scalar clock field .",
    "usually , the dynamics of a vector field @xmath38 is dictated by the action @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the faraday tensor defined as @xmath41 and where the subscript @xmath42 indicates that the indices are raised with the euclidean metric @xmath43 .",

    "it is obvious that in @xmath12 this effective metric reduces to the minkowski metric @xmath113 .",
    "this section has provided the general construction of a mechanism that allows for scalar , vector , and spinor fields to actually propagate in an effective lorentzian metric even though the underlying theory is purely euclidean and written in terms of the euclidean metric @xmath86 .",

    "the properties of this model when @xmath114 is not constant will be discussed in   [ subsec5.3 ] below . as we shall see in the next section",
    "the clock field should enjoy a shift symmetry in order for the system to exhibit the time translation symmetry after the emergence of time . in @xmath12 , both the shift symmetry and the translational symmetry along the direction of @xmath115",
    "are spontaneously broken , but a combination of them remains unbroken and is responsible for the existence of a conserved quantity that reduces in @xmath12 to the usual notion of energy .",
    "it is limited to classical field theory in flat space .",
    "the extension to curved space is discussed in ",
    "[ sec3 ] and   [ sec4 ] below and the quantum aspects are left for future investigations .",
    "the origin of the effective lorentzian dynamics in @xmath12 can be intuitively understood for scalars and vectors . for scalars ,",
    "the action  ( [ e.chi1 ] ) is equivalent to the coupling to the effective metric @xmath116 for vectors , one could have simply used a coupling to @xmath117 and a lagrangian of the form @xmath118 since the extra term quartic in @xmath115 compared to the action  ( [ e.a1 ] ) is of the form @xmath119 and does not contribute ( note that it reduces to @xmath120 in @xmath12 ) .",
    "hence , the apparent lorentzian dynamics for scalars and vectors boils down to the fact that @xmath121 .",
    "massive point particles also propagate in this metric .",
    "this interpretation can not be extended to spinors mostly because of the @xmath85-matrices , at least straightforwardly .",
    "it is however important to realize that despite this , when restricted to @xmath12 all fields propagate in the same effective minkowski metric so that the equivalence principle is safe in first approximation . 6 .",
    "the couplings to the clock field have been tuned in order to recover the exact minkowski actions .",
    "for instance , the action  ( [ e.chi1 ] ) for a scalar field could have been chosen as @xmath122.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in such a case , a lorentzian signature is recovered only if @xmath123 . in the case where these constants are not tuned ,",
    "different fields can have different lightcones .",
    "this will be discussed in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "7 .   in the bosonic sector , since the theory is invariant under the euclidean parity ( @xmath124 ) as well as the field parity ( @xmath125 ) , both @xmath126 and @xmath127 invariances in the emergent lorentzian theory are ensured . without the field parity invariance ,",
    "the @xmath127 invariance would be spontaneously broken by a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the derivative of the clock field .",
    "this explains the reason why we have included only quadratic terms in @xmath114 in the actions for scalars and vectors .",
    "8 .   in the fermionic sector ,",
    "let us first remark that one could have constructed @xmath128 independent euclidean @xmath85-matrices , explicitly given by @xmath129 from the dirac spinor @xmath73 , we can thus construct bilinear combinations that transform as scalars under @xmath93 rotations . among them , hermitian bilinears that do not include more than one derivative acting on spinors are the following ten possibilities @xmath130 the first two of the left column correspond to the standard mass and kinetic terms while six among the eight others describe possible couplings to the clock field . among these six couplings ,",
    "we have only used the two which were sufficent as an existence proof of our mechanism for dirac spinors , namely @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "it has to be remarked that the second term is not cpt invariant after the clock field has a vev . hence ,",
    "unless the coefficient of this term is exactly the value shown in ( [ e.spin1 ] ) , the cpt invariance is violated .",
    "we also need to emphasize that we have been able to construct dirac spinor but that we also need to construct majorana and weyl spinors .",
    "this is an open problem at the moment .",
    "the mass scale @xmath17 is related to @xmath114 and is arbitrary .",
    "it is important to realize that it does not appear in the final expressions of the effective lorentzian actions .",
    "@xmath133 may not be constant if @xmath134 ( curved space ) and/or if @xmath114 is not strictly constant in @xmath12 .",
    "this will be discussed in   [ sec3 ] and   [ sec5 ] .",
    "the configuration of the clock field is not arbitrary but should be determined by solving the equation of motion . since the action for the clock field enjoys a shift symmetry , its equation of motion takes the form of a current conservation .",
    "this will be addressed in ",
    "[ sec3 ] , where we will show that @xmath13 can be a solution , e.g. with @xmath10 .",
    "so far , our description has been restricted to the classical dynamics of standard fields in flat spacetime .",
    "the first natural generalisation we must consider is the way to include gravity , i.e. a theory that will mimic or be close to general relativity .    for this purpose , we now consider a general @xmath8-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath9 with a positive definite metric @xmath135 . again",

    "we have expressed the effective lorentzian action that can emerge in a patch @xmath12 of the euclidean space .",
    "it allowed us to list a set of constraints arising from the stability of the cosmological solution , and the requirement for the different test fields to propagate in the same metric , in order for the weak equivalence principle to hold .",
    "the effective fundamental constants , such as the three non - gravitational coupling constants and the gravitational constant , are spacetime dependent and the difference of the propagation speeds of gravity and electromagnetic waves can also set constraints on our model .",
    "we have proposed an heuristic description on the way the lorentz symmetry can emerge on a band of energy scales .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", our construction gives a new insight into the need for lorentzian metric as a fundamental entity .",
    "as we have shown , this is not a mandatory requirement and a decent field theory , at least at the classical level , can be constructed from a riemannian metric",
    ". such a formalism may be fruitful in the debate on the emergence of time and , speculating , for the development of quantum gravity .",
    "it also opens up a series of questions and possibilities that will be addressed in a companion article  @xcite",
    ". we can list ( 1 ) the construction of majorana and weyl spinors , ( 2 ) the development of a quantum theory and study of particle creation  @xcite , ( 3 ) the possibility from the classical viewpoint that singularities in our local lorentzian region may be related to singularities in the clock field ( e.g. similar to topological defects ) and not in the metric of the euclidean theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar idea in a totally different setup ) , ( 4 ) the possibility that a de sitter spacetime may be an `` illusion '' in an anti - de sitter riemannian space .",
    "it then follows that a euclidean ads / cft correspondence at the microscopic level would reveal itself as a ds / cft correspondence in our effective lorentzian universe .",
    "all these are indeed , for now , bold speculations but they illustrate that this framework may be fruitful for extending our current field theories , including general relativity .",
