    "how galaxies were formed and evolved is still an unsolved question .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath8-cold dark matter ( @xmath8cdm ) cosmological scenario has stressed the attention on the smallest of these systems : the dwarf galaxies . from a cosmological point of view",
    ", dwarfs would be the first galaxies ever formed , from which bigger structures would have formed via mergers @xcite . since they were the smallest galaxies known until the discovery of the ultra faint galaxies , the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) were proposed as the _ building blocks _ of the bigger systems .",
    "+ dsphs are systems characterized by low surface luminosities ( @xmath9 ) , small sizes ( about a few hundred of parsecs ) , and lack of gas .",
    "the relatively large velocity dispersions observed in the dsphs , exceeding 7 @xmath10 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , suggest the presence of abundant dark matter in them . assuming to be virialized systems , dsphs reach mass - to - light ratios of @xmath11 in solar units @xcite .",
    "all these discoveries have given rise to competing interpretations concerning their origin and cosmological significance .",
    "+ dsphs had been traditionally considered as rather simple and evolved systems , dynamically supported by the random motion of their stars ( pressure supported ) .",
    "their spheroidal shape , together with the apparent lack of gas , has contributed to this idea .",
    "notwithstanding , each dsph appears to be unique in its star formation history ( sfh ) , and chemical evolution ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in addition rotation signatures",
    "have been reported in some dsph galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "dsphs show a panoply of properties which are still under debate . + several mechanisms have been proposed to be affecting the formation and evolution of these systems .",
    "the most relevant include local processes , such as supernova ( sn ) feedback and interactions with nearby systems , as well as global cosmic environmental factors like the early reionization of the universe by uv radiation @xcite .",
    "different combinations of these together with other mechanisms may be implied in the evolution of dsph galaxies , causing the large variety in their observed properties .",
    "+ in the present work , we revisit the fornax dsph , one of the nine classic dsph satellites of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "fornax is , after the sagittarius dsph , the largest and most luminous of the dsphs mw companions , with a core radius of @xmath12 550 pc .",
    "it is located at a distance of 136@xmath135 kpc @xcite , and its principal baryonic component is stellar , with an ambiguous detection of @xmath14 @xcite possibly associated with the mw . the dynamical mass within the observed half - light radius has been estimated to be @xmath15 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "+ fornax is a remarkable object to study .",
    "it hosts five globular clusters and shows two conspicuous star clumps located at @xmath16 and at 1.3@xmath17 from its centre .",
    "how these clumps were formed is subject of debate .",
    "some authors claim that these structures are the result of a past merger @xcite . on another hand ,",
    "@xcite claim that these clumps are more likely to be the result of the quiet infall of gas previously expelled by fornax during its star formation episodes .",
    "its sfh is complex and long - standing @xcite , while its dynamics has turned out as rather complex @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work we carry out a comprehensive and deep study of the morphological properties of the fornax dsph galaxy .",

    "section  [ cap : cmd ] describes the colour magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , together with the method followed for sampling the different stellar populations . in section  [ cap:2dmaps ] ,",

    "finally , a summary and the main conclusions of the work are presented in section  [ cap : summary ] .",
    "there exist a large amount of photometric data for fornax , collected with a large variety of scientific objectives , field of view , and data depth , the two latter running normally in opposite directions . with the aim of covering the largest possible area of the galaxy",
    ", we have compiled the biggest existing photometric catalogue for this galaxy , with more than @xmath0 stars .",
    "this photometric list is based on the calibrated photometry obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first catalogue ( cat1 ) consists in an extensive ensemble of archive data , and comprises about @xmath0 stars .",
    "the second one ( cat2 ) contains photometry from mosaic@ctio for about @xmath18 stars .",
    "both photometries cover the main body of the galaxy , spanning roughly 2 square degrees on the sky in the @xmath19 , and @xmath20 filters , and extending up to more than @xmath21 to the north - east from the centre of the galaxy .",

    "the centre of fornax derived by @xcite is represented by a blue cross ( @xmath23 2h 39@xmath24 53.1@xmath25 , @xmath26 -34@xmath17 30@xmath24 16.0@xmath25 ) .",
    "small blue open circles mark the position of globular clusters and are labelled accordingly .",
    "the position of the shell found by @xcite is marked at the south - east of the core of the galaxy . ]    since two different catalogues are being used , two aspects must be checked to ensure the homogeneity and self - consistency of the final photometry list : first , that all star magnitudes are in the same photometric system ; and secondly that , since both catalogues overlap a large area in the sky , there are not repeated stars . besides , the complete sample must be clean from non - stellar objects . in order to fulfil these requirements we followed the procedures described in appendix  [ ap : internal_calibration ] .",
    "the calibrated cmd of fornax is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd ] .",
    "the most conspicuous features are a young main sequence ( ms ) , and strongly populated red giant branch ( rgb ) and red clump ( rc ) . the bluest and",
    "brightest stars of the ms ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) are younger than 1 gyr .",
    "the rgb is formed by intermediate - age and old stars , older than 12 gyr .",
    "its thickness , significantly larger than the photometric error , suggests a spread in metallicity .",
    "the rc is centred at @xmath29 0.7 and @xmath30 0.5 .",
    "it is essentially populated by helium - burning stars , with relatively large metallicities , and young - to - intermediate ages .",
    "also a large number of very old , metal - poor stars ( @xmath31 gyr , @xmath32 ) populate the horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "the latter indicates the presence of low mass stars older than 10 gyr .",
    "finally , a slight over - density is apparent approximately 0.5 mag above the rc , identified as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) clump .",
    "this wide spectrum of features indicates a complex sfh .",
    "+      stars arrange in a cmd according to their intrinsic characteristics ( i.e. mass and metallicity ) and to their evolutionary state .",
    "stars born within the time interval @xmath33 $ ] and within the metallicity interval @xmath34 $ ] can be formally defined as a simple stellar population .",
    "therefore , a more complex stellar population can be considered as an ensemble of several simple stellar populations , which can be studied in detail by means of stellar evolutionary models .",
    "this makes out the cmd a powerful tool , providing valuable information about the different stellar populations of a stellar system through comparison with stellar evolutionary models .",
    "+ in order to extract the maximum information from the observed cmd of fornax we used iac - star @xcite to compute a synthetic cmd ( scmd ) based on the averaged sfh derived in @xcite , i.e. , using the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) and the sfr derived for fornax as inputs for iac - star .",
    "the resulting scmd corresponds to a stellar population representative of the average sfh of fornax , computed as the arithmetic mean of the three sfhs derived within ic1 , ic2 , and oc regions , weighted by the areas of the elliptical annuli centred in fornax which enclose each one of these regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this scmd can be sampled , providing information about the properties of the observed stars . in fig .",

    "it are summarized in table  [ tab : integrated_quantities_2 ] . +",
    "other ingredients of the iac - star code used for generating the scmd were the following : the scaled - solar basti @xcite stellar evolution library , completed by @xcite models for very low mass stars , a fraction of 40 per cent of binaries , and the initial mass function by @xcite , i.e. , a power law with exponent @xmath35 for stellar masses above @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for stellar masses between 0.080.5 @xmath38 ."
