    "the standard statistical mechanics approach to study the phase transitions of a model amounts to analyze its pressure functional looking for points of non - analiticity . a different and interesting way to achieve this result is provided by the description of the asymptotic behavior of the sum of the random variables occurring in the model @xcite . due to the interaction , these variables do not satisfy the hypothesis of independence required in order to apply the central limit theorem .",
    "nevertheless , if the phase of the model is not critical it is expected that their sum , with square root normalization , shows a central limit type behaviour and thus converges toward a gaussian distribution .    for a wide class of models known in literature as curie - weiss models @xcite",
    "such a prediction was confirmed in @xcite where it was also described the asymptotic non - gaussian behavior corresponding to the critical point of the model ( this result was first shown in @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the same analysis was conducted for the multi - species mean - field model : a generalization of the curie - weiss model in which spin random variables are partitioned into an arbitrary number of groups and both the interaction and the external field parameters take different values only depending on the groups variables belong to .",
    "this model , whose bipartite symmetric version was introduced in the 50s to reproduce the phase transition of the so - called metamagnets @xcite , recently has been receiving a renewed attention @xcite mainly thanks to its potential ability to account for the collective behavior of socio - economic agents @xcite .",
    "the idea of using statistical mechanics to describe the outcomes of individual decisions at population level appeared in literature in the early 80s @xcite as a consequence of the increased emphasis on the role played by social interaction in shaping personal preferences .",
    "in fact , the occurence of sudden behavioral shifts such as trends , fads and crashes might be hardly understood if the agents would take decisions without influencing one another .",
    "interestingly , the need to incorporate peer - to - peer effects into the framework of the discrete choice theory @xcite , a model able to forecast with a remarkable agreement collective phenomena in which social interactions do not play a substantial role , led to the formulation of a model @xcite equivalent from the mathematical point of view to the curie - weiss model . since the discrete choice theory rephrased as a statistical mechanics model corresponds to a mixture of a finite number of discrete perfect gases , its natural extension to the interacting case",
    "is represented by the multi - species mean - field model .    despite the great importance that this model may play toward",
    "the understanding of socio - economical phenomena , a complete description of its phase space is lacking to this day .",
    "on one hand standard investigations of the critical points of the pressure functional were performed only in specific cases @xcite , on the other the analysis of the asymptoic behavior of the sums of the spins @xcite was done under the assumptions that the hamiltonian is a convex function of the the sums of the spins of each group ( convexity hypothesis ) , and the pressure functional can be written as an homogeneous and strictly positive polynomial around its minimum points ( homogeneity hypothesis ) .    in this paper we made a step forward in filling the gap in literature dealing with a specific situation beyond the homogeneity hypotesis for the bipartite mean - field model in absence of the external field .",
    "in particular we consider the model as the unique minimum point of the pressure functional is the origin and its hessian matrix computed in that point has determinant equal to zero without being equal to the null matrix . by applying to the vector of the total magnetizations the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the hessian matrix of the pressure functional , we obtain a new random vector that , properly rescaled",
    ", weakly converges to the product of a gaussian distribution and a distribution proportional to @xmath0 , where the positive constant @xmath1 can be computed from the pressure functional .",
    "the discovery of a non - central limit type behavior allows us to assert that the bipartite mean - field model undergoes a phase transition in the considered scenario , as previously proved only when the two groups of particles had the same size and the same strenght of internal interaction @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section one describes the model and states the main result .",
    "section two contains the proof of the main result .",
    "the appendix presents the proof of the lemmas used to prove the main result .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath2 spin particles divided in two subsets @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively of size @xmath5 and @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "particles interact with each other according to the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the spin of the particle @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the parameter that tunes the mutual interaction between the particles @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "such a parameter takes values according to the following symmetric matrix : @xmath14 + where each block @xmath15 has constant elements @xmath16 .",
    "we assume @xmath17 and @xmath18 be strictly positive , while @xmath19 can be positive or negative allowing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we observe that for @xmath20 the bipartite mean - field model degenerates toward two distinct curie - weiss models .    by introducing the total magnetization of each group : @xmath21",
    "we may easily express the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian.1 ] ) as a binary quadratic form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vector of the total magnetizations and @xmath24 is the so - called reduced interaction matrix .",
    "the joint distribution of a spin configuration @xmath25 is given by the boltzmann - gibbs measure : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the partition function @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the measure : @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 denotes the unit point mass with support at @xmath33 .",
    "the definition of @xmath29 implies that each spin variable can take only the values @xmath34 .",
    "the inverse temperature parameter @xmath35 is not explicitly written because we consider it absorbed within the model parameters .",
    "the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the pressure @xmath36 associated to the model is proved in @xcite where it is also computed the exact value of such a limit for models whose hamiltonian is a convex function of the total magnetizations ( for the computation of the limit in the general case see @xcite ) .",

    ", it is shown the basic role played by the functional @xmath38 in determining the limiting behavior of the random vector @xmath41 .",
    "we recall briefly the results , obtained under the convexity and the homogenity hypothesis described in the introduction .",
    "when @xmath38 has a unique minimum point , the random vector @xmath41 , suitably rescaled , weakly converges to a bivariate gaussian only if the order of the approximation of @xmath38 around that point is the second .",
    "otherwise , @xmath41 converges to a distribution proportional to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the homogeneous and strictly positive polynomium of order @xmath44 that approximates @xmath38 around the minimum point . when there are more minimum points , analogous results are valid locally around each of them .    in this paper , we consider the bipartite mean field model defined by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian.2 ] ) as the pressure functional @xmath38 has a unique minimum point , the origin , in which the determinant of its hessian matrix is equal to zero and the convexity hypothesis is still verified . in the considered case ,",
    "the homogeneity hypothesis is not true unless all the elements of the hessian matrix of @xmath38 at the origin are equal to zero .",
    "due to the convexity hypothesis that happens if and only if @xmath20 . the asymptotic behavior of the vector of the total magnetizations @xmath41 as the parameter @xmath19 assumes values different from zero is investigated in the following :    [ teo ] consider the bipartite mean - field model described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian.2 ] ) where the matrix @xmath45 is positive definite with @xmath46 and let the origin be the unique minimum point of the pressure functional @xmath38 given by ( [ pressure.functional ] ) .",
    "denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively the largest and the smallest eigenvalue of the hessian matrix of @xmath38 computed in the origin and by @xmath49 and @xmath50 the corresponding eingenvectors , define the random vector @xmath51 as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . if @xmath55 then there exist @xmath56 strictly positive such that , as @xmath57 , the random vector @xmath58 weakly converges to @xmath59    we claim that the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related to the pressure functional @xmath38 and will be computed explicitly in the proof .",
    "let us start by determining for which values of the model parameters the origin is the unique minimum point of the function @xmath38 , that is the unique solution of the system : @xmath62 that represents the estremality conditions of @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath46 , after inverting the hyperbolic tangent in the two equations , we can rewrite the system ( [ mean.field.equations ] ) in the following fashion : @xmath63 that lends itself to a graphic resolution . considered the cartesian coordinate system @xmath64 , defined the functions @xmath65 and denoted by @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively the graph of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the solutions of ( [ sistema.invertito ] ) are the intersections between @xmath66 and the symmetrical curve of @xmath67 with respect to the line @xmath70 ( in the following we denote the latter curve by @xmath71 ) .    ) in the case of a unique solution .",

    "therefore , for a unique intesection of @xmath66 and @xmath71 in the origin , @xmath74 and @xmath75 both must be strictly increasing or decreasing and the slope in the origin to @xmath76 must be bigger in absolute value than the slope in the origin to @xmath71 . by computing the first derivatives of @xmath68 and @xmath69 it is easy to show that the condition on the monotonicity is fulfilled as @xmath77 and @xmath78 ,",
    "while the other condition is true as @xmath79 in particular , considered the elements of the hessian matrix of @xmath38 in the origin @xmath80 when the inequality ( [ derivatecurve ] ) is verified as an identity we have : @xmath81 therefore the hypotheses of the theorem are true when the model parameters verify the following system of conditions : @xmath82 whose latter inequality is a direct consequence of the positive definiteness of the matrix @xmath45 when the ( [ derivatecurve ] ) is verified as an identity .    to prove the theorem , considered the orthogonal matrix @xmath54 of the normalized eingenvectors of the hessian matrix of @xmath38 in the origin",
    ", we introduce the function @xmath83 , that will play the same role of the function @xmath38 in @xcite .",
    "although the result ( [ result.theorem ] ) holds for any possible choice of the eigenvectors , to make the proof clear it is worth to work with the explicit expressions of two of them . by choosing @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are given by ( [ elementi.hessiana ] ) and considering the euclidean norm , we have : @xmath88 with : @xmath89 and : @xmath90 + the proof needs the following three lemmas .

    "the result is a direct consequence of the equivalence between the weak convergence of measures and the pointwise convergence of characteristic functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ lemma.2 ] if the matrix @xmath45 of a model defined by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian.2 ] ) is positive definite , then for any @xmath100 @xmath101 where the function @xmath102 is given by ( [ function.g.tilde ] ) .",
    "see appendix a for the proof .",

    "then there exists @xmath106 such that @xmath107    see appendix b for the proof .",
    "+ now we are ready to prove the theorem [ teo ]",
    ". we will proceed in two steps .",
    "first , considered the random vector @xmath108 with joint distribution @xmath109 where @xmath53 and @xmath110 is the symmetric @xmath111 matrix of elements @xmath112 defined in ( [ coefficenti.jtilde ] ) , we show that , when @xmath108 is independent of @xmath113 for each @xmath2 , the distribution of the random vector @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 that is a well defined distribution because the involved integral is finite by lemma ( [ lemma.2 ] )",
    ". then we will analize the distribution ( [ step.1 ] ) as @xmath57 .",
    "given @xmath116 real @xmath117 where @xmath118 while @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath113 is independent of @xmath108 , from equality ( [ prob.1 ] ) it follows that the distribution of the random vector ( [ sum.vectors ] ) is the convolution of the distribution of @xmath121 with the distribution of @xmath122 . by ( [ bivariate.gaussian ] ) ,",
    "the former distribution is : @xmath123 while , by ( [ measure.bg ] ) , the latter is : @xmath124 with @xmath125 the distribution of @xmath126 on @xmath127 .",
    "thus : @xmath128 by considering the definition of @xmath113 given in ( [ definizione.s.tilde ] ) , we can write the elements of @xmath126 , given in ( [ nuove.variabili.aleatorie ] ) , in the following way : @xmath129 that allows to calculate : @xmath130 where : @xmath131 by computing the euclidean norm of the two eigenvectors @xmath49 , @xmath50 defined in ( [ eigenvectors ] ) and considering the explicit expressions of @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , given in ( [ coefficenti.jtilde ] ) , it is easy to show that @xmath135 and @xmath136 , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath137 , are defined in ( [ coefficenti.abtilde ] ) . therefore after making the change of variable @xmath140 , @xmath141 and integrating over @xmath142 , we have : @xmath143    taking @xmath144 and @xmath145 in the ( [ last.passage.step.1 ] ) , we obtain an equation for @xmath27 which when substituted back yields the result ( [ step.1 ] ) .    now to conclude the proof of the theorem , by lemma [ lemma.1 ]",
    ", we have to analyze the distribution ( [ step.1 ] ) as @xmath57 , keeping in mind that only the first component of the random vector @xmath108 contributes to the limit .",
    "let us start by observing that the hypothesis on @xmath38 togheter with the definition @xmath83 , imply that the origin is the unique minimum point of the function @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , since the system of conditions ( [ 00.minimum.point ] ) is satisfied , the hessian matrix of @xmath102 computed in the origin , @xmath146 , has determinant equal to zero without being the null matrix .",
    "thus , by taylor expansion , there exists @xmath147 sufficiently small so that , as @xmath57 , for @xmath148 and @xmath149 we can write : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a multi - index , @xmath152 , while the coefficients are the followings : @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we observe that @xmath156 and @xmath157 are strictly positive because the model parameters fulfill the system of conditions ( [ 00.minimum.point ] ) .",
    "moreover , since the image under @xmath102 of the origin is zero , we can find @xmath158 sufficiently small so that , as @xmath57 , for @xmath159 and @xmath160 @xmath161 thus , defined @xmath162 , as @xmath57 , for @xmath163 and @xmath164 we have : @xmath165 considered the set @xmath166 , by lemma [ lemma.3 ] there exists @xmath167 such that for any bounded continuous function @xmath168 : @xmath169 on the other hand by ( [ taylor ] ) , ( [ convergenza.dominata ] ) and dominate convergence , as @xmath57 : @xmath170 therefore , by ( [ limit.1 ] ) and ( [ limit.2 ] ) , as @xmath57 we have that : @xmath171    as mentioned previously , while @xmath172 does not contribute to the limit of the distribution ( [ step.1 ] ) , the distribution obtained in the variable @xmath173 , a gaussian with zero mean and variance equal to @xmath174 where @xmath156 is given in ( [ coefficent.1 ] ) , is the convolution of the marginal distribution of @xmath175 with the limiting distribution of the first element of the vector ( [ vettore.s.1 ] ) . since the marginal distribution of @xmath175 is gaussian too , if the difference @xmath176 between the variance of the distribution obtained by convolution and those of @xmath175 @xmath177 is positive we can conclude that the limiting distributions of @xmath178 is a gaussian with zero mean and variance equal to @xmath176 .",
    "to prove that @xmath176 is positive let us consider the strictly convex function @xmath179 .",
    "after computing the second partial derivatives of @xmath180 in the origin : @xmath181 and denoting the hessian matrix of @xmath180 by @xmath182 , we can write : @xmath183 since the function @xmath180 is strictly convex and @xmath184 with @xmath185 and @xmath45 positive definite matrices and @xmath186 an ortogonal matrix , we can conclude that @xmath187 . +",
    "thus the statement ( [ result.theorem ] ) is proved by defining @xmath188 and @xmath189 where @xmath176 is given by ( [ variance ] ) and @xmath157 by ( [ coefficent.2 ] ) .",
    "this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "in this paper we extended previously obtained results ( see @xcite ) on the limiting behavior of the random vector of total magnetizations for the bipartite mean - field model .",
    "we worked under the assumptions that the hamiltonian is a convex function of the total magnetizations , the external field is away and the pressure functional admits a unique minimum point , the origin , in which the determinant of the hessian matrix is equal to zero . as a consequence",
    "the homogeneity hypothesis on the pressure functional made in @xcite , is true only if there is no interaction between particles of different groups , that is the bipartite mean - field model degenerates towards to distinct curie - weiss models . in the non - degenerate case",
    ", we found a non gaussian limit distribution for the vector of the total magnetizations after being transformed with the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the hessian matrix of the pressure functional .",
    "this result allows us to state that in the considered case the bipartite mean - field model undergoes a phase transition .    the complete description of the asymptotic distribution of the vector of total magnetizations both for the bipartite and the generic multipartite mean - field model will be subject of further investigations .",

    "this proves the statement ( [ result.lemma.2 ] ) for @xmath195 .",
