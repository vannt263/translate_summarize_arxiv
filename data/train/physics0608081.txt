    "the simulation of the calorimeter has proved to be a crucial element for the precision measurement of physical observables , like the mass of the top quark , since it appears as one of the keys to control the jet energy scale systematics .",

    "the calorimeter simulation was initially tuned to test beam data and has been improved due to a steadily refined _ in situ _ tuning using samples of isolated charged particles , which recently became available over a remarkably extended momentum range up to 40gev . here",

    "the uncertainty is dominated by a contribution of 1.6% due to electrons pointing at the cracks between the towers , whereas electrons well contained in the target tower account for less than 1%  @xcite .",
