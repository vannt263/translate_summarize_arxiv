    "coherent population trapping was discovered in the interaction of sodium atoms with a laser field in 1976 .",
    "@xcite . due to this effect a substantial part of population , because of destructive quantum interference between different excitation pathways , is trapped in a coherent superposition of ground state sublevels  dark states . with a coherent population trapping",
    "are associated dark resonances when due to this effect absorption and as a result fluorescence from atoms decreases , but intensity of the transmitted light increases when part of the atomic population is trapped in dark states .",
    "if in addition to the optical excitation an external magnetic field is applied , it can destroy coherence between ground state sublevels and return trapped population into absorbing states and , as a result , increase absorption and fluorescence , but decrease a transmitted light .",
    "a review of applications of dark resonances was published some years ago by arimondo @xcite .",
    "coherence in an atomic ground state attracted substantial attention in connection with lasing without inversion @xcite , magnetometry @xcite and laser cooling @xcite . as a result",
    "dark resonances recently are studied in detail , including open systems @xcite and systems with losses @xcite .",
    "in course of these studies a new and unexpected phenomenon was observed by authors of @xcite . in this study d@xmath0 line of @xmath1rb atoms",
    "was excited by a diode laser .",
    "radiation was tuned to the absorption from optically resolved ground state hyperfine level @xmath2 originating from atomic @xmath3s@xmath4 state .",
    "the final state of the transition was rb @xmath3p@xmath5 excited state .",
    "hyperfine components of this level was not resolved and all allowed in a dipole transition excited state hyperfine levels with quantum numbers @xmath6 were excited . in contrary to the usual dark resonance signal when in the absence of the magnetic field one can observe increased transmittance and decreased fluorescence intensity authors observed opposite effect  decreased transmittance which increases with magnetic field applied and an increased fluorescence intensity which decreased when field was applied .",
    "authors of the paper @xcite write that the physical reason of this effect _ remains still unclear_. they suppose that one of the reasons for the peak in the fluorescence could be the non - coupled states on the zeeman sublevels of the excited hyperfine levels .",
    "these non - coupled states , as it is supposed in @xcite , inhibit the stimulated emission induced by the laser field .",
    "the decrease of stimulated emission leads to an increase of the fluorescence .    in this letter",
    "we offer , in our opinion , very simple and strait forward explanation of the origin of these  reversed  dark resonances and perform experimental and numerical studies of them .",
    "in a simple qualitative explanation traditional dark resonances can be connected with a well known optical pumping phenomenon .",
    "let us assume that we excite atomic transition @xmath7 with a linearly polarized light .",
    "direction of the @xmath8 axis is chosen along the light electric field vector @xmath9 .",
    "as a result @xmath10 absorption takes place and transitions occur between ground and excited state magnetic sublevels with @xmath11 @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are magnetic quantum numbers of the ground and excited states respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . according to this scheme absorption",
    "does not take place from ground state magnetic sublevels with quantum number @xmath14 , because for these states there are no corresponding excited state magnetic sublevel with the same magnetic quantum number value .    in the spontaneous decay dipole transitions from optically populated excited state magnetic sublevels @xmath15 to the nonabsorptive ground state sublevels @xmath14",
    "are allowed . as a result",
    ", if relaxation in the ground state is slow , in a steady state conditions substantial part of the population will be optically pumped to the ground state sublevels with quantum numbers @xmath14 and will be trapped there . as a result traditional decrease of the absorption and fluorescence and increase of the transmittance",
    "will be observed , because the population of absorbing ground sate magnetic sublevels will be reduced .",
    "if we now apply an external magnetic field in a direction perpendicular to the @xmath8 axis , field will mix ground state sublevels effectively and will return trapped population into the states from which absorption takes place . as a result absorption and fluorescence will increase .",
    "this is a qualitative explanation of the usual dark resonance .",
    "a similar reasoning can be exploited to explain the  reversed  resonance observed in @xcite and in this paper .",
    "let us assume that we excite with @xmath16 radiation atomic transition @xmath17 .",
    "in this case there are no ground state sublevels not involved in the absorption that can trap atomic population .",
    "the actual relative transition rates proportional to the squared respective clebsch  gordan coefficients in this system of sublevels are shown in fig .",
    "as one can see ground state magnetic sublevel @xmath18 is the most absorbing - with highest relative absorption rate . at the same time just to this sublevel intensively with high rates decay all three excited state  magnetic sublevels populated by the light .",
    "one can expect that in a conditions of a steady state excitation , as a result of interplay of absorption and decay rates , population of the intensively absorbing ground state magnetic sublevel @xmath19 will be increased and , as a result , one can expect increased absorption and fluorescence from this atom and decreased transmittance of the resonant laser light .",
    "if an external magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to @xmath8 axis it will mix ground state magnetic sublevels and redistribute population between the ground state magnetic sublevels . as a result population of intensively absorbing magnetic sublevel @xmath18 will be decreased . at the same time population of less absorbing magnetic sublevels",
    "@xmath20 will be increased  this means that the total absorption and fluorescence will be decreased and transmittance will be increased .",
    "this means that reversed dark resonance will be observed .    to prove this qualitative consideration",
    "let us solve balance equations for the magnetic sublevel stationary population @xmath21 in the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in a steady state conditions for the ground state",
    "magnetic sublevels we will obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 is excited state relaxation rate , @xmath24 absorption rate , and @xmath25 ground state magnetic sublevel population in absence of the radiation . in a condition when absorption is slow @xmath26  weak absorption , we have @xmath27 if we now keep in mind absorption rates from different magnetic sublevels of the ground state , see fig . [ fig2 ] , and calculate the overall absorption from such state and compare it with the absorption from the equally populated magnetic sublevels ( when magnetic field is applied ) than we see an increase in the absorption rate by a factor @xmath28 or by approximately @xmath29",
    ".    the same calculation can be performed for the transitions @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for these schemes in a similar way we will obtain even larger increase of the absorption due to this specific optical pumping .",
    "the increase will be by a factor @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "this means that the described effect increases with increase of the quantum numbers of involved levels .",
    "of course presented description is only qualitative , but in our opinion gives a good idea what is happening when reversed dark resonances are observed . to have a quantitative description of the phenomenon one must solve equations for the density matrix for an open system with losses .",
    "we will not do this in present paper .",
    "instead a simple analysis will be carried out .",
    "an analysis of the probabilities of optical transitions originating from @xmath34 between excited hyperfine levels of the rb atom show that levels @xmath35 are populated in the ratio ( @xmath36 .",
    "it means that a hyperfine transition leading to the reversed dark resonances discussed above is most strongly excited . for",
    "this scheme let us calculate a signal shape using a full density matrix approach .",
    "we solved a rate equations for a density matrix , see @xcite , chapter 5 , for @xmath37 transition .",
    "a broad line approximation was used .",
    "it means that we assume that in a magnetic field all magnetic sublevels are in equally good resonance with radiation .",
    "secondly , we assumed that at a magnetic field strength used in the experiment ( resonance width is less than 100 mg ) hyperfine levels experience linear zeeman effect .",
    "no substantial hyperfine level mixing at applied field strength takes place .",
    "direct rb atom magnetic sublevel splitting in a magnetic field calculations and measurements prove that these assumption are valid , see for example @xcite . for signal simulation",
    "the following rate constants were used .",
    "excited state relaxation rate @xmath38 s@xmath39 @xcite , absorption rate @xmath40 s@xmath39 , ground state relaxation rate @xmath41 s@xmath39 ( mainly due to collisions with the walls of the cell and fly - through the excitation laser beam ) .",
    "lande factors @xmath42 , @xmath43 were calculated in a standard way from the atomic and nuclear data available in @xcite .",
    "we suppose that a magnetic field is applied along @xmath8 axis .",
    "laser light excites @xmath31 transition and is linearly polarized along @xmath44 axis .",
    "intensity of the fluorescence with the same polarization is calculated and the intensity of the transmitted beam is also calculated as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the results are presented in a fig .",
    "they demonstrate well pronounced reverse resonances and are in a very good qualitative agreement with the measurements obtained in @xcite , see fig .",
    "5 . there . width of these resonances can be varied by changing ground state lande factor value , ground state relaxation rate and absorption rate .    at week absorption @xmath45 the dark resonance width",
    "is determined by a condition when ground state larmor frequency is equal to the ground state relaxation rate . for @xmath2 state of @xmath1rb atom at low concentration",
    "it can be as narrow as @xmath46 mg .",
    "this is a width that was actually observed in @xcite .",
    "obtained signals in some sense are the same as the ground state hanle effect measured in atoms as well as in molecules in great extent , see .",
    "for example @xcite . in case of molecules also reversed structure in ground state hanle effect was observed . in case of molecules ,",
    "when optical pumping takes place in an open cycle and a total ground state population is substantially reduced , this structure can be attributed to a high order coherence created between ground state magnetic sublevels @xcite",
    "we performed measurements of these reversed resonances also in our laboratory . in our experiment",
    "we use isotopically enriched rubidium ( 99 % of @xmath1rb ) that is contained in a glass cell at room temperature to keep atomic vapor concentration low and avoid reabsorption .",

    "absorption signal ( transmitted light ) is monitored by a photodiode . as the laser is swept applying a ramp on a drive current , two absorption peaks with half - width of about @xmath53 mhz separated by @xmath54 ghz",
