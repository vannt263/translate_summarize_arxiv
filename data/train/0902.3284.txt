    "to determine the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath1 , thus the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - rich nuclear matter , has been a longstanding goal of both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "the @xmath1 is critical for understanding not only the structure of rare isotopes and heavy - ion reactions  @xcite , but also many interesting issues in astrophysics  @xcite . in this contribution we first summarize some recent progress in constraining the @xmath1 from analyzing the isospin diffusion and @xmath0 ratio in heavy - ion collisions within an isospin and momentum dependent transport model ibuu04  @xcite .",
    "we will then discuss some astrophysical ramifications of the partially constrained @xmath1 .",
    "some interesting information about the @xmath1 has been obtained over the last few years from heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . as an example , shown in the middle of fig .",

    "are also shown . shown in the left window",
    "is the degree of isospin diffusion @xmath3  @xcite versus the slope parameter @xmath4 of the mdi symmetry energy . within the ibuu04 model analysis , the msu data of tsang et al .",
    "@xcite favors a @xmath1 between that with @xmath5 and @xmath6 around the apr prediction .",
    "more quantitatively , one can infer that the slope parameter is about @xmath7 mev  @xcite .",
    "we notice that a very recent re - analysis of the msu isospin diffusion data using the imqmd model found that the extracted range of the @xmath1 overlaps with that from the ibuu04 analysis around the @xmath1 with @xmath5 ( or apr )  @xcite . in the msu isospin diffusion reactions the maximum density reached is about @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the isospin diffusion was found to probe the symmetry energy during the expansion phase of the reaction  @xcite .",
    "thus the isospin diffusion data provides us information about the @xmath1 in the sub - saturation density region .    very interestingly ,",
    "a recent ibuu04 transport model analysis of the fopi / gsi @xmath0 ratio data  @xcite in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at sis / gsi with beam energies above 400 mev / a provides circumstantial evidence suggesting a rather soft nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath9 compared to the apr prediction  @xcite . shown in the right window are the calculated @xmath0 ratios in comparison with the fopi data at 0.4 agev with the reduced impact parameter @xmath10 as a function of the neutron / proton ratio of the reaction system .",
    "the inset shows the @xmath0 ratio as a function of @xmath11 for the @xmath12ru+@xmath12ru reaction at 0.4 agev .",
    "it is seen that both the data and the calculations exhibit very weak @xmath11 dependence for the @xmath0 ratio , even for mid - central reactions where we found that the multiplicities of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 vary appreciably with the @xmath11 . for",
    "the symmetric @xmath15ca+@xmath15ca and the slightly asymmetric @xmath12ru+@xmath12ru reactions , calculations using both @xmath16 and @xmath5 can well reproduce the fopi data .",
    "most interestingly , for the more neutron - rich reactions of @xmath12zr+@xmath12zr and @xmath17au+@xmath17au calculations with @xmath18 and @xmath19 are clearly separated from each other .",
    "the fopi data favors clearly the calculation with @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding symmetry energy is much softer than the apr prediction .",
    "a detailed study on the excitation function of the @xmath0 ratio also indicates that the fopi data can be approximately reproduced only with the @xmath16 symmetry energy  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that iqmd calculations  @xcite give similar results as the ibuu04 with @xmath5 .",
    "this is not surprising since the symmetry energy functionals used in the iqmd and the ibuu04 with x=0 are very similar for @xmath20 as shown in the middle of fig .",
    "[ esym00 ] .",
    "the most importance influence of a rather soft symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities , such as that with @xmath16 , on pion production is through the rather high neutron / proton ratio reached in the participant region due to the dynamical isospin fractionation . as shown in the middle window , with @xmath16",
    "the @xmath1 at @xmath9 reached in the reaction is very small .",
    "thus a rather high @xmath21 in the participant region is energetically favored due to the dynamical isospin fractionation  @xcite and thus the larger @xmath0 ratio is observed . in the reactions considered at 400 mev / a",
    ", the maximum central density reached is about @xmath22 . by varying separately the @xmath1 at sub- and supra - saturation densities used in the ibuu04 simulations for these reactions",
    "it was found that the @xmath0 ratio is much more sensitive to the variation of the @xmath1 at supra - saturation rather than sub - saturation densities .",
    "putting together the information from analyzing both the isospin diffusion and the @xmath0 ratio data , we expect that the @xmath1 reaches a maximum somewhere between @xmath23 and @xmath24 before it starts decreasing at higher densities .",
    "this indicates the importance of mapping out the @xmath1 at densities from about @xmath23 to @xmath22 .",
    "such experiments are being planned at several facilities .",
    "if the @xmath1 is confirmed by more experimental and theoretical studies to decrease with increasing density above certain density , it not only posts a serious challenge to some nuclear many - body theories but also has important implications on several critical issues in nuclear astrophysics , such as , the cooling of proto - neutron stars , the possible formation of polarons due to the isospin separation instability  @xcite , the possible formation of quark droplets  @xcite and hyperons  @xcite in the core of neutron stars .",
    "since the @xmath1 is only partially constrained in some density regions by the available experimental data within the ibuu04 transport model analyses , astrophysical applications of these constraints involve some interpolations and/or extrapolations under some assumptions .",
    "we notice here , however , that the extrapolation of any low - density symmetry energy to supra - saturation densities can be very dangerous as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . using the same ibuu04 transport model , at sub - saturation densities the isospin diffusion analyses favors clearly the apr prediction , but above about @xmath24 the @xmath0 ratio data favors instead the gogny prediction that is much softer than the apr prediction .",
    "fortunately , while many astrophysical questions depend on the symmetry energy over the whole density range , some issues , such as the core - crust transition density in neutron stars depends only on the @xmath1 at sub - saturation densities . in the following section , we present several examples illustrating the astrophysical importance of the @xmath1 using the mdi eos with @xmath5 and @xmath6 extrapolated to supra - saturation densities .",
    "effects of the softening of the @xmath1 , such as that with @xmath16 , is currently under investigation .",
    "neutron stars are expected to have a solid inner crust surrounding a liquid core .",
    "knowledge on properties of the crust plays an important role in understanding many astrophysical observations  @xcite .",
    "the inner crust spans the region from the neutron drip - out point to the inner edge separating the solid crust from the homogeneous liquid core . while the neutron drip - out density @xmath25 is relatively well determined to be about @xmath26 g/@xmath27 @xcite , the transition density @xmath28 at the inner edge is still largely uncertain mainly because of our very limited knowledge on the eos , especially the density dependence of the symmetry energy , of neutron - rich nucleonic matter  @xcite",
    "recently , using the equation of state for neutron - rich nuclear matter constrained by the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion reactions in the same sub - saturation density range as the neutron star crust , xu et al .",
    "put a tight constraint on the location of the inner edge of neutron star crusts  @xcite .",
    "the inner edge corresponds to the phase transition from the homogeneous matter at high densities to the inhomogeneous matter at low densities . in principle , the inner edge can be located by comparing in detail relevant properties of the nonuniform solid crust and the uniform liquid core mainly consisting of neutrons , protons and electrons ( @xmath29 matter ) .",
    "however , this is practically very difficult since the inner crust may contain nuclei having very complicated geometries , usually known as the ` nuclear pasta '  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the core - crust transition is thought to be a very weak first - order phase transition and model calculations lead to very small density discontinuities at the transition  @xcite . in practice , therefore , a good approximation is to search for the density at which the uniform liquid first becomes unstable against small amplitude density fluctuations with clusterization .",
    "this approximation has been shown to produce very small error for the actual core - crust transition density and it would yield the exact transition density for a second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "several such methods including the dynamical method  @xcite , the thermodynamical method  @xcite and the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite have been applied extensively in the literature .     as a function of @xmath30 ( left windows ) and @xmath31 ( right windows ) by using both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods with the full eos and its parabolic approximation .",

    "[ rhotpt ] are the predictions by kubis using the pa of the mdi eos in the thermodynamical approach  @xcite . the large error introduced by the pa is understandable since the @xmath36-stable @xmath29 matter is usually highly neutron - rich and the contribution from the higher order terms in @xmath37 is appreciable .",
    "this is especially the case for the stiffer symmetry energy which generally leads to a more neutron - rich @xmath38 matter at subsaturation densities .",
    "in addition , simply because of the energy curvatures involved in the stability conditions , the contributions from higher order terms in the eos are multiplied by a larger factor than the quadratic term .",

    "this is very important for guiding the gravitational wave search provided the mass and radius of the prospective source ( neutron star ) are known . on the other hand , when the gravitational wave astronomy becomes a reality , namely if both the frequency and dumping time for a given neutron star are known this could provide information on the neutron star mass and radius . in figs .",
    "[ wen2 ] the fitting curves representing the results of tsui et al .  @xcite are also shown .",
    "it is seen that the numerical results of wen et al .",
    "are in good agreement with those of tsui et al .",
    "in summary , important progress has been made in recent years in constraining the symmetry energy with heavy - ion collisions .",
    "their implications in some astrophysical phenomena have been explored . nevertheless , the field is still at its beginning .",
    "while a number of potentially useful probes of the @xmath1 have been proposed , available experimental data are mostly for reactions with stable beams  @xcite . coming experiments with more neutron - rich nuclei at several advanced radioactive beam facilities",
    "are expected to improve the situation dramatically .",
