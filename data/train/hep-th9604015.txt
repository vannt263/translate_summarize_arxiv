    "unfortunately it is not so easy to obtain the correct feynman rules , i.e.  a set of rules yielding the same results for observable quantities as calculations in covariant gauges .",

    "these are caused by the fact that such gauge conditions are insufficient to _ completely _ remove the gauge degrees of freedom .",

    ", the necessity of introducing even new multi - gluon vertices appears in the coulomb gauge @xcite .",
    "these additional vertices are due to operator ordering problems which are difficult to handle in the familiar path integral approach .",
    "they give rise to anomalous interaction terms at the two - loop level @xcite and cause still unsolved problems with renormalization at the three - loop level @xcite .    in this article",
    "we are interested in the radial ( fock - schwinger ) gauge condition @xmath0 it found widespread use in the context of qcd sum - rules ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there it is used as being more or less synonymous to the important field strength formula @xmath1 which enormously simplifies the task of organizing the operator product expansion of qcd n - point functions in terms of gauge invariant quantities by expressing the gauge potential via the gauge covariant field strength tensor .",
    "it was introduced long ago @xcite , @xcite and rediscovered several times ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "only a few efforts have been made to establish perturbation theory for radial gauge .",
    "the main reason for this is that the gauge condition breaks translational invariance since the origin ( in general an arbitrary but fixed point @xmath2 , c.f .",
    "( [ eq : arbz ] ) ) is singled out by the gauge condition .",
    "thus perturbation theory can not be formulated in momentum space as usual but must be set up in coordinate space .",
    "the first attempt to evaluate the free radial propagator was performed in @xcite .",
    "later however the function @xmath3 presented there was shown to be not symmetric @xcite .",
    "moreover it could not be symmetrized by adding @xmath4 since the latter is not a solution of the free dyson equation .",
    "it was even suspected in @xcite that it might be impossible to find a symmetric solution of this equation in four - dimensional space , due to the appearance of divergences even on the level of the _ free _ propagator when one uses the field strength formula to derive a free propagator .",
    "indeed we agree with this statement in principle , but we will present an explanation for this problem and a way to bypass it . other approaches to define a radial gauge propagator",
    "try to circumvent the problem ( e.g. @xcite ) by sacrificing the field strength formula as given in ( [ eq : fsformula ] ) which was one of the main reasons the gauge became popular in non - perturbative qcd sum rule calculations @xcite in the first place .",
    "if we are not prepared to do so we are forced to understand the origin of the divergences that plague most of the attempts to define even free propagators in radial gauges and see whether they can be dealt with in a satisfying manner .    in section  [ sec : radgaugecond ] we will make the first and decisive step in this direction by exploring the completeness of the gauge condition ( [ eq : fsgaugecond ] ) and its relation to the field strength formula and developing a new representation of the gauge potentials via link operators .",
    "in section  [ sec : radprop ] we use this information to relate the divergences encountered in some of the attempts to define radial propagators to the renormalization properties of link operators .",
    "we find that even free propagators in radial gauge may feel remnants of the renormalization properties of closed , gauge invariant wilson loops .",
    "surprising as this seems to be superficially it is not impossible however if we recall that the inhomogeneous term in the gauge transformation has an explicit @xmath5 factor in it . as a result",
    "we are able to define a regularized radial propagator using the field strength formula and established regularization procedures for link operators .",
    "section  [ sec : radcalc ] will be devoted to demonstrate the consistency of our approach by calculating a closed wilson loop using our propagator and relating the steps to the equivalent calculation in feynman gauge .",
    "in section  [ sec : radren ] we obtain an explicitly finite version of our propagator by completing the renormalization program developed for link operators before we summarize and compare our results to other approaches in the literature in  [ sec : radsum ] and shortly discuss the next steps in the program of establishing a new perturbative framework in radial gauges which  although the steps to be performed are quite straightforward  we will postpone for a future publication .    in the following we work in a @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space .",

    "before we can go ahead and tackle the problem of divergences in the radial gauge propagator we have to establish a clearer picture of the uniqueness of the gauge condition we are about to implement .",
    "after all , if we do not succeed to fix the gauge completely we might be naturally confronted with divergences  if not at the free level then later in perturbative calculations .",
    "they would be a simple consequence of the incompleteness of the gauge fixing and the zero modes of the propagator which would then necessarily be present .",
    "this point has caused a still continuing discussion for the case of axial gauges ( e.g. @xcite ) but is only briefly mentioned in the context of radial gauges ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this geometry is illustrated in fig .",

    "they parameterize the residual gauge freedom not eliminated by ( [ eq : fsgaugecond ] ) .",
    "note that while @xmath24 is completely arbitrary the solutions ( [ eq : gaugesol ] ) ask only for its behavior at the given hyper - surface @xmath21 .",
    "the simplest and most intuitive choice for @xmath21 is a spherical hyper - surface around @xmath2 .",
    "introducing the appropriate spherical coordinates it becomes obvious that @xmath26 parameterizes gauge transformations which purely depend on the angles",
    ". clearly the radial gauge condition ( [ eq : arbz ] ) can not fix the angular dependence of any gauge transformation in ( [ eq : transformations ] ) .    to eliminate the residual gauge freedom one has to impose a condition which is stronger than ( [ eq : arbz ] ) and suffices to pin down @xmath24 up to a global transformation . a possible choice for such a gauge fixing would be the condition @xmath27 which in addition to the vanishing of the radial component of the gauge potential also implements a covariant gauge on the hyper - surface @xmath21 .",
    "such a gauge for arbitrary @xmath21 would immediately force us to introduce ghosts into the path integral",
    ". moreover the field strength formula would also be lost as we will illustrate below .",
    "there is one exception to these unwanted modifications however , which may be implemented by contracting the closed surface @xmath21 to the point @xmath2 .",

    "this sets the stage for a further exploration of the radial gauge in a context where we can be sure of having completely fixed the gauge in such a way that the field strength formula is guaranteed to be valid .",
    "before we go on to studying the consequences the above has for the implementation of propagators we will introduce yet another representation of the gauge field in this particular complete radial gauge  this time solely in terms of link operators .",

    "we will see that for this purpose the complicated looking wilson loop representation ( [ propa ] ) is much more useful than the field strength formula ( [ profi ] ) .",
    "( note , however , that the result for the free propagator ( [ divprop ] ) of course will be the same . )",
    "it is well - known that wilson loops need renormalization to make them well - defined ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "we refer to @xcite for more details about renormalization of regular ( smooth and simple ) loops .",

    "the observation that wilson loops with cusps and/or cross points show additional divergences has an important consequence for our radial gauge propagator as given in ( [ propa ] ) : even the free propagator needs renormalization !",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the fact that a naive calculation of this object yields an ultraviolet divergent result @xcite .",
    "note that the usual divergences of wilson loops which are removed by @xmath62 , like e.g.  vertex divergences , appear at @xmath78 and thus do not contribute to the free part of the radial gauge propagator , while the cusp singularities indeed contribute since they appear at @xmath79 and affect the free field case due to the factor @xmath80 in ( [ propa ] ) .",
    "now we are able to answer the question whether the radial gauge is `` unphysical '' or `` very physical '' .",

    "one might cast the answer in the following form : _ the propagator diverges because of  and not contrary to  the fact that the radial gauge is `` very physical''_.    consequently the next questions are :    * is there any use for a divergent expression for the free propagator ?",

    "usually the parameter integrals in the vicinity of the cusp do the job . for gauge choices where the propagator do not vanish in the vicinity of the origin this is automatically achieved .",
    "let us assume for a moment that it is possible to construct a _",
    "finite _ radial gauge propagator obeying the field strength formula ( [ eq : fsformula ] ) and therefore have trivial gauge factors along radial lines .",
    "of course this is nothing but saying that there are no contributions form parts 1 and 3 of the loop , i.e.  in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "since the propagator is assumed to be finite , there are no singular integrals corresponding to the cusp at the origin .",
    "thus a finite radial gauge propagator can not reproduce the correct behavior of the wilson loop . in turn",
    "we conclude that _ a singular radial gauge propagator is mandatory _ to get the right renormalization properties of wilson loops .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate in the next section , the renormalization procedure for wilson loops can be used to devise a consistent renormalization program for the radial gauges considered here .",
    "we will apply it to write down a finite version of the free radial propagator .",
    "the generalization to higher orders in perturbation theory is straightforward . according to our considerations given above we",
    "shall show that the renormalized , thus finite version of the free radial propagator is not suitable as an input to perturbative calculations .",
    "we define the renormalized radial gauge propagator by @xmath98 where we have suppressed most of the other variables on which @xmath99 depends ( see ( [ barw ] ) ) .    from now on we will concentrate on the calculation of the renormalized free propagator @xmath100 . the details of the renormalization program are presented in appendix  [ app : renprog ] .",

    "we use some technical results derived in appendix  [ siint ] .",
    "the divergent part of the propagator ( [ divprop ] ) is given by @xmath103^{1-d/2 } \\,.\\ ] ] using ( [ appi2 ] ) and ( [ i2neq ] ) we find @xmath104 and thus @xmath105    note that if one tries to guess a finite expression like @xmath106 one would have to introduce a scale @xmath67 by hand without interpretation . in our derivation",
    "this scale appears naturally as the typical renormalization scale of the @xmath107 operation .",
    "the counter term @xmath108 has some interesting properties .",
    "it is symmetric with respect to an exchange of all variables and it obeys the gauge condition @xmath109 thus @xmath100 is finite in the limit @xmath48 but still can be interpreted as a gluonic two - point function which fulfills the radial gauge condition @xmath110 however the counter term @xmath108 and thus also @xmath100 is ill - defined at the origin and hence conflicts with the field strength formula ( [ eq : fsformula ] ) .",
    "note that the regularized propagator in contrast to the renormalized propagator is well defined and vanishes if one of its arguments approaches zero , as pointed out after eq .",
    "( [ divprop ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that we may use the regularized propagator in perturbative calculations and can be ensured to preserve relations like the field strength formula or eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fistr ] ) or ( [ eq : propdef ] ) throughout the calculation .",
    "although the counterterms are not well defined at the reference point itself  a property the radial gauge propagator simply inherits from renormalizing the cusp singularity of the underlying wilson line  physical ( gauge invariant ) quantities are not affected , they are rendered finite and unambiguous .",
    "in this article we have shown how to calculate the radial gauge propagator in a @xmath6-dimensional space using wilson loops . as discovered in @xcite",
    "the free propagator diverges in four - dimensional space .",
    "we were able to explain this singular behavior by studying the properties of associated wilson loops .",
    "furthermore we have shown that the free propagator , in spite of being divergent in four dimensions , can be used for perturbative calculations in a ( dimensionally ) regularized framework and that the result for a gauge invariant quantity agrees with the calculation in feynman gauge .",
    "finally we have presented a renormalization procedure for the radial gauge propagator and calculated the explicit form of the renormalized free propagator .",
    "we have pointed out that any version of the radial propagator which is finite in four - dimensional space at least can not reproduce the correct renormalization properties of wilson loops with cusps at the reference point @xmath2 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the radial gauge propagators as presented here with other approaches : as discussed in section  [ sec : radgaugecond ] the radial gauge condition ( [ eq : fsgaugecond ] ) does not completely fix the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the field strength formula @xmath111 is not the only solution of the system of equations @xmath112 one might add a function @xcite @xmath113 to ( [ fistrag ] ) where @xmath114 is an arbitrary homogeneous function of degree 0 .",
    "however any @xmath115 added in in order to modify ( [ fistrag ] ) is necessarily singular at the origin .",
    "hence regularity at the origin may be used as a uniqueness condition @xcite .",
    "if we relax this boundary condition other solutions are possible , e.g. @xmath116 where we must assume that the field strength vanishes at infinity . while ( [ fistrag ] ) is the only solution which is regular at the origin , ( [ fistrinf ] ) is regular at infinity . ignoring boundary conditions for",
    "the moment one can construct a radial gauge propagator by @xcite @xmath117 with @xmath118 it turns out that this propagator is finite in four dimensions .",
    "however the price one has to pay is that boundary conditions are ignored and thus the object `` lives '' in the restricted space @xmath119 and not in @xmath120 anymore . in our approach",
    "we insist on the field strength formula ( [ fistrag ] ) widely used in operator product expansions @xcite and on the regular behavior of vector potentials at the origin @xcite .",
    "one might use the propagator ( [ menprop ] ) to calculate the @xmath70-contribution to the wilson loop on the contour ( [ looppath ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that the result differs from the one obtained in ( [ wilir ] ) , ( [ lengthy ] ) .",
    "clearly this is due to the fact that ( [ menprop ] ) is ill - defined at the origin .    in the above",
    ", all calculations were performed in euclidean space . in minkowski space wilson loops",
    "show additional divergences if part of the contour coincides with the light cone @xcite .",
    "thus we expect the appearance of new singularities also for the radial propagator , at least if one or both of its arguments are light - like .",
    "further investigation is required to work out the properties of the radial gauge propagator in minkowski space .    to formulate perturbation theory in a specific gauge",
    "the knowledge of the correct free propagator is only the first step .",
    "in addition one has to check the decoupling of faddeev - popov ghosts in radial gauge which is suggested by the algebraic nature of the gauge condition .",
    "however the still continuing discussion about temporal and axial gauges might serve as a warning that the decoupling of ghosts for algebraic gauge conditions is far from being trivial ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . to prove ( or disprove ) the decoupling of ghosts in radial gauge",
    "we expect that our wilson loop representation of the propagator is of great advantage since it yields the possibility to calculate higher loop contributions in two distinct ways : on the one hand one might use the wilson loop representation to calculate the full radial propagator up to an arbitrary order in the coupling constant .",
    "the appropriate wilson loop can be calculated in any gauge , e.g.  in a covariant gauge . on the other hand",
    "the radial propagator might be calculated according to feynman rules .",
    "since the results should coincide this might serve as a check for the validity and completeness of a set of radial gauge feynman rules .",
