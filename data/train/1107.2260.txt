    "there are various inequalities in analysis that encode intrinsic self - improving properties of the oscillations of the functions involved .",

    "in particular , for every @xmath6 , @xmath7 therefore , the oscillations @xmath5 , which are a priori in @xmath8 , turn out to be in the `` better '' space @xmath9 . the same occurs with the well - known fact that @xmath10-poincar inequality in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 implies that , for all @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 . again , if @xmath17 is such that @xmath18 , the fact that the oscillation is in @xmath9 yields that the oscillation is indeed in the smaller space @xmath19 . b. franchi , c. prez and r.l .",
    "wheeden in @xcite gave a unified approach to these kinds of estimates .",
    "namely , they start with inequalities of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a functional depending on the cube @xmath3 , and sometimes on the function @xmath17 . using the caldern - zygmund theory and the good-@xmath22 inequalities introduced by d.l .",
    "burkholder and r.f .",
    "gundy @xcite these authors present a general method that gives @xmath9 integrability of the oscillation @xmath5 under mild geometric conditions on the functional @xmath21 .",

    "generalizations of the previous estimates have been already studied .",
    "one can define new oscillations by replacing the averaging operator @xmath25 by some other operator @xmath26 ( here @xmath27 is a parameter defined in terms of the sidelength of @xmath3 that `` scales '' @xmath28 to @xmath3 ) where @xmath29 is a semigroup ( or , more in general , some `` approximation of the identity '' ) . in the particular case where the kernels of the operators have enough decay ( i.e. , the family @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31 off - diagonal estimates ) this new way of measuring the oscillation allowed the second author @xcite to introduce a new sharp maximal operators by simply replacing @xmath5 by @xmath32 .",

    "we obtain a direct proof of the john - nirenberg inequality for the @xmath0 space defined in @xcite .",
    "we also obtain similar estimates for the corresponding lipschitz spaces introduced in @xcite and this allows us to define these spaces using @xmath23 averages ( in place of @xmath45 as done in @xcite ) of the oscillations .",
    "also our results can be applied to derive some generalized poincar inequalities with right hand sides that are dyadic expansions taking into account the lack o f localization of the semigroups .",

    "<S> our results provide a unified theory that is applicable to the classical poincar inequalities and furthermore it includes oscillations defined in terms of semigroups associated with second order elliptic operators as those in the kato conjecture . in this latter situation </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a direct proof of the john - nirenberg inequality for the associated @xmath0 and lipschitz spaces of @xcite . </S>"
