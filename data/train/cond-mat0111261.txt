    "diffusion - limited reactions in low - dimensional geometries have been studied intensely because they exhibit  anomalous kinetics , \" that is , behavior different from that predicted by the laws of mass action in well - stirred systems  @xcite . among the simplest and most extensively studied are single species diffusion - limited coagulation ( @xmath0 or @xmath2 )  @xcite and annihilation ( @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "these reactions , which show anomalous behavior in one dimension , are of particular theoretical interest because they lend themselves to _ exact _ solution in one dimension .",
    "exact one - dimensional solutions can be obtained for diffusion in continuous  @xcite as well as in discrete  @xcite systems .",
    "a particularly elegant solution of the coagulation problem is provided by the method of intervals .",
    "this method focuses on the diffusive evolution of empty intervals , that is , of intervals that contain no particles  @xcite .",
    "the empty interval equation turns out to be linear and hence exactly solvable . originally developed for continuous systems ,",
    "the method has been extended to discrete lattices  @xcite .",
    "the method of intervals can not be directly adapted to the annihilation reaction , but a new formalism , the method of odd / even intervals which keeps track of the parity ( even or odd ) of the number of particles in an interval , has recently been developed  @xcite .",
    "again , the odd / even interval equation turns out to be linear and hence exactly solvable .",
    "the anomalies of the @xmath4 problem in one dimension are typically displayed in two ways : one is through the time dependence of the reactant concentration @xmath5 , which for the @xmath0 and the @xmath6 reactions in infinite systems decays asymptotically as @xmath7 instead of the law of mass action decay @xmath8 .",
    "the other is through the interparticle distribution function @xmath9 , which is the ( conditional ) probability density for finding the nearest particle at a distance @xmath10 on one side of a given particle",
    ". this function scales as @xmath11 , in typical diffusive fashion . in one dimension",
    "a gap develops around each particle that leads to a more ordered spatial distribution than the exponential distribution implicit in well - stirred systems and  explains \" the relative slowing down of the reaction .    in a parallel development ,",
    "the problem of  anomalous diffusion \" has also attracted a great deal of attention  @xcite .",
    "the universally accepted characterization of anomalous ( as in  not ordinary \" ) diffusion is through the mean squared displacement of a process @xmath12 for large @xmath13 , @xmath14 ordinary diffusion ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) follows gaussian statistics and fick s second law for the probability density for finding the process at @xmath10 at time @xmath13 , @xmath17 leading to linear growth of @xmath18 with time .",
    "anomalous diffusion is characterized by a nonlinear dependence .",
    "if @xmath19 the process is subdiffusive or dispersive ; if @xmath20 it is superdiffusive .",
    "anomalous diffusion is associated with many physical systems and is not due to any single universal cause , but it is certainly ubiquitous . nor is anomalous diffusion modeled in a universal way ; among the more successful approaches to the subdiffusive problem , which is the case we consider in this work , have been continuous time random walks with non - poissonian waiting time distributions  @xcite , and fractional dynamics approaches in which the diffusion equation ( [ peqdifun ] ) is replaced by the generalized diffusion equation  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the riemann - liouville operator , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the generalized diffusion coefficient that appears in eq .",
    "( [ meansquaredispl ] ) . some limitations of this description and some connections between the generalized diffusion equation and continuous random walk formulations have been discussed recently  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a combination of these two phenomena , namely , the kinetics of @xmath4 reactions of particles that move subdiffusively in one dimension  @xcite . some aspects of this problem have also been considered using the waiting time distribution approach  @xcite .",
    "those solutions require approximations relating the reactant concentration to the distinct number of sites visited by a particle  @xcite , or the waiting time distributions for single particles to the waiting time distributions for relative motion  @xcite . here",
    "we adapt the fractional dynamics approach to the problem and take advantage of the fact that the resulting generalized diffusion equations can be solved in closed form  @xcite .",
    "we consider both coagulation and annihilation reactions .    in section  [ evolution ]",
    "we develop the fractional diffusion equations from which one obtains the concentration of reactant as a function of time .",
    "for the coagulation reaction we generalize the empty interval method  @xcite and , for the annihilation reaction , the odd / even interval method  @xcite .",
    "the solutions are presented in section  [ solanni ] .",
    "sections  [ evolution ] and [ solanni ] deal with kinetics on continuum one - dimensional systems ; in section  [ lattice ] we extend the analysis to reactions on a lattice .",
    "the differences between the continuum and discrete results are most pronounced at early times ( long - time differences are due to finite size effects that get pushed to longer times if one deals with larger systems ) .",
    "we conclude with a recapitulation in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "consider first the coagulation reaction @xmath25 when the particles move by ordinary diffusion .",
    "the probability distribution function for the position @xmath10 of any _ one _ @xmath26 particle _ in the absence of reaction _ obeys the diffusion equation ( [ peqdifun ] ) .",
    "the coagulation problem can be formulated in terms of the probability @xmath27 that an interval of length @xmath10 is empty of particles at time @xmath13 .",
    "empty interval \" function obeys the diffusion equation  @xcite @xmath28 the derivation of this equation is straightforward and recognizes that an empty interval is shortened or lengthened by movement of particles in and out at either end according to the dynamics described by eq .",
    "( [ peqdifun ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to recall this derivation as given in refs .",
    "the reasoning is more transparent if the diffusion processes that lead to the change @xmath29 are described on a lattice with lattice spacing @xmath30 and sites labeled by integers . in this lattice @xmath31 gives the probability that sites @xmath32 through @xmath33 , for example , are empty at time @xmath13 . since the event @xmath34 contains the event @xmath35 , the probability that sites @xmath32 through @xmath33 are empty but that there is a particle at site @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "the particles move randomly to the nearest lattice site with a hopping rate @xmath38 , the rate @xmath39 to the right being equal to the rate to the left .",
    "if the particle at @xmath36 moves to site @xmath33 in a short time interval @xmath40 , @xmath35 will decrease by @xmath41(e_{n}-e_{n+1})\\delta t$ ] . on the other hand , @xmath35 may increase by the departure of a particle at site @xmath33 to site @xmath36 ; the associated increase is @xmath41(e_{n-1}-e_{n})\\delta t$ ] .",
    "the same entry and exit processes can take place at the other end of the interval . combining these four processes",
    "then gives for the change in @xmath35 @xmath42 the coagulation reaction fixes the boundary condition .",
    "coagulation involves adjacent occupied sites and either of the two particles hopping onto the other , thereby disappearing .",
    "two adjacent sites can both be occupied , or one can be occupied and the other empty ( probability @xmath43 because this can occur in two ways ) or both can be empty ( probability @xmath44 ) . since this covers all possibilities , the probability that two adjacent sites are occupied is therefore @xmath45 .",
    "the change in @xmath46 is thus @xmath47 and for this equation to fit the pattern of eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) it is necessary to require the boundary condition @xmath48 letting @xmath49 and",
    "both @xmath30 and @xmath50 then leads to the continuous equation ( [ eeqdifun ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath51 the other boundary condition requires that the population of particles be nonvanishing : @xmath52 the empty interval dynamics is thus essentially the same as that of individual particles in the absence of reaction , but with different boundary conditions and a diffusion coefficient @xmath53 that reflects the fact that the relative motion of two diffusive particles involves twice the diffusion coefficient of each particle alone .",
    "the connection between the empty interval function and the observables of interest is obtained as follows  @xcite . back in the discrete formulation , the probability that a site is occupied ( i. e. not empty ) is @xmath54 , and the concentration of particles is therefore @xmath55 where we have exhibited the continuum limit .",
    "the interparticle distribution function @xmath56 is the probability that the nearest neighbor to one side of a given particle is @xmath33 lattice spacings away .",
    "this probability is related to @xmath35 by @xmath57 the first sum insures that the next neighbor is at least @xmath58 sites away and the second that @xmath58 is at least @xmath36 .",
    "the normalization takes into account that the average distance between the particles is the reciprocal of the concentration , @xmath59 equation  ( [ dipdf ] ) can be inverted : @xmath60 where again we have exhibited the continuum limit .",
    "the construction of the kinetic equation for @xmath27 for subdiffusive particles proceeds along arguments analogous to those used in the diffusive case .",
    "again , one follows the motion of the particles in and out at the ends of the empty interval according to the dynamics ( [ pfracdifu ] ) .",
    "however , for particles that move subdiffusively , the concept of a hopping rate ( steps per unit time ) is not defined because the number of steps performed up to time @xmath13 by a subdiffusive particle goes as @xmath61 with @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the derivation of the empty interval equation must be adjusted accordingly .",
    "proceeding as above in the discrete formulation , we see that the probability that sites @xmath32 through @xmath33 are empty but that there is a particle at site @xmath36 is still @xmath37",
    ". however , the rate of decrease of @xmath35 due to a particle that moves from site @xmath36 to site @xmath33 is now described by the generalized diffusion process implicit in eq .",
    "( [ pfracdifu ] ) , that is , @xmath63(e_n - e_{n+1})\\delta t$ ] . collecting arrival and departure processes at both ends of the interval",

    "( [ e0c ] ) and ( [ einf ] ) , as are the relations ( [ c ] ) and ( [ ipdf ] ) to the observables .",
    "the empty interval method can not be applied to the annihilation reaction @xmath6 because annihilation leads to a discontinuous growth of empty intervals .",
    "however , recently a new method of odd / even intervals has been introduced that leads to exact solution in the diffusion - limited case .",
    "it is based on the construction of an equation for @xmath66 , the probability that an arbitrary interval of length @xmath10 contains an even number of particles at time @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this probability does not change if two particles inside the interval react since this process does not change the even / odd parity of the interval . because @xmath66 changes only by the movement of particles in or out of the ends of the interval , arguments similar to those that lead to eq .",
    "( [ eeqdifun ] ) lead to the same equation for @xmath66 .",
    "this procedure can again be directly extended to the subdiffusive problem , and @xmath66 satisfies the same fractional diffusion equation as @xmath27 : @xmath67 one boundary condition is the same as for @xmath27 and is obtained via the same arguments used earlier : @xmath68 the other boundary condition in general differs from that of the empty interval method and depends on the initial condition .",
    "in particular , it is determined by the parity of total initial number of particles .",
    "this parity never changes .",
    "a random initial placement leads to an equal probability that the system forever contain an even or and odd number of particles , so that @xmath69 the concentration of particles is related to @xmath66 precisely as in eq .",

    "note that in the continuum solution one does not distinguish between the even and odd particle number cases : the boundary condition ( [ rccxinfini ] ) is an average of the two , and so the continuum curves should be compared to the average of the discrete ones for the two boundary conditions .",
    "we have considered the coagulation dynamics @xmath0 and the annihilation dynamics @xmath1 for particles moving subdiffusively in one dimension .",
    "this scenario combines the  anomalous kinetics \" and  anomalous diffusion \" problems , each of which leads to interesting dynamics separately and to even more interesting dynamics in combination .",
    "the fractional diffusion equation plays a central role in our analysis and allows the exact calculation of the density @xmath5 within this formulation .",
    "we have calculated @xmath5 explicitly for all times for the coagulation reaction in a one - dimensional continuum for two initial distributions , a random ( poisson ) distribution and a periodic distribution .",
    "this calculation is based on the empty interval method . using the odd / even interval formulation ,",
    "we have also obtained an explicit solution for the annihilation reaction with a random initial distribution . for a periodic initial distribution",
    "we are only able to calculate the laplace transform of @xmath5 analytically and must perform the inversion numerically .    for the coagulation reaction the empty interval method also leads to an explicit solution for the interparticle distribution function @xmath9 . at long times",
    "we find a universal expression for this distribution ( i.e. , one independent of initial distribution ) , in terms of a single scaled variable .",
    "anomalous diffusion is characterized by the exponent @xmath118 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ meansquaredispl ] ) , ordinary diffusion corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "deviations from ordinary diffusion lead to a curious interplay . on the one hand , with decreasing @xmath118 ( and hence increasingly subdiffusive motion ) the decay of the particle density towards extinction becomes increasingly slower and in this sense increasingly different from law of mass action behavior . on the other hand , for the coagulation reaction the spatial distribution of initially randomly distributed reactants remains more poissonian for all time as @xmath118 decreases ; indeed , as @xmath118 deviates from unity the relatively empty regions around each particle that are tantamount to ( and indeed explain ) anomalous kinetics in the usual diffusion - limited case become more populated .",
    "we have also considered the problem of subdiffusion - limited reaction on discrete lattices .",
    "we have presented a hierarchy of differential - difference equations for the empty interval probability @xmath200 and the even / odd interval probability @xmath201 , and have expressed the solutions @xmath202 as a superposition of subdiffusive modes whose decay is governed by the mittag - leffler function in the same way that the exponential function governs the decay of ordinary diffusive modes . as in ordinary diffusion  @xcite , the associated concentrations @xmath5 differ from the continuum solutions at early times . at long times",
    "the lattice solutions deviate from those of the continuum systems when there is only a small number ( one or two ) of particles remaining in the system .",
