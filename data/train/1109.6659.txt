    "<S> the emission spot is essentially equal in size to the laser excitation spot indicating that excitons are localized and do not travel outside the laser excitation spot . at high exciton densities , </S>",
    "<S> the emission spot is larger than the laser excitation spot indicating that excitons are delocalized and travel outside the laser excitation spot ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transport_modulation]h ) . in similarity to the localization - delocalization transition studied in linear lattices @xcite , this behavior corresponds to the exciton localization in the combined lattice potential and disorder potential at low densities and exciton delocalization due to screening of the potential by the repulsively interacting excitons ( the amplitude of the disorder potential in the sample is @xmath46 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : transport_modulation]h shows that a higher exciton density and , in turn , higher interaction energy is required for screening the potential with a higher lattice amplitude , in agreement with this model .     and accounting for spatial resolution as in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> mev , @xmath47 , @xmath48 k , @xmath49.,width=283 ]    in order to examine this agreement quantitatively , we considered a mean - field model  @xcite where the local density @xmath50 of bright excitons is the solution of the equation @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the density of states per spin , @xmath53 is the dimensionless interaction constant , @xmath54 is the exciton electrochemical potential , and @xmath55 is the exciton temperature . within this model , the first moment of the exciton emission energy proves to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the dilogarithm function . </S>",
    "<S> from these two quantities the local pl intensity and energy can be calculated ( see above ) . for a more accurate comparison with the experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we also included the effect of the finite spatial resolution of our optical system . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of the fitting parameters in the model @xmath58 for the defocussing parameter ( see supplementary information ) , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 leads to a reasonable agreement between the simulations ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : theory ] ) and the experiment ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transport_modulation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this fitting should not be overemphasized because of a number of the fitting parameters and approximations made in the model .    in conclusion , we present a method for producing 2d lattices for indirect excitons and experimental proof of principle for this method . </S>",
