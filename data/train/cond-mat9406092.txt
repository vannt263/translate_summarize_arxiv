    "ueno et al . @xcite pointed out that the differences in the free energy @xmath2 of systems with different boundary conditions , such as periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , might be a powerful alternative to the fourth - order cumulant @xcite in the study of critical phenomena . for the ising model ,",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions force an interface into the system , and @xmath2 can be interpreted as interface free energy . in the case of @xmath3-invariant vector models with @xmath4 , such as the @xmath0 model ( @xmath5 ) and the classical heisenberg model ( @xmath6 ) , however , the continuous symmetry of the model prevents the creation of a sharp interface and @xmath2 becomes rather a measure for the helicity - modulus .",
    "ueno et al .",
    "@xcite give , based on previous results @xcite , the scaling relation f = f(t l^1/ ) , where @xmath7 is the reduced temperature , @xmath8 the linear extension of the lattice , and the reduced free energy @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the partition function of the system .",
    "it is important to note that the above relation requires that all directions of the lattice scale with @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that the crossings of @xmath2 , plotted as a function of the temperature for different @xmath8 , provide estimates for the critical temperature .",
    "furthermore the energy difference @xmath12 , which is the derivative of @xmath2 with respect to the inverse temperature , scales as e l^1/ [ enerskal ] , where @xmath1 is the critical exponent of the correlation length @xmath13 .",
    "the drawback of the method outlined above is that , in general , it is hard to obtain free energies from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the standard approach is to measure @xmath12 at a large number of temperatures and perform a numerical integration starting from @xmath14 or @xmath15 , where the free energy is known , up to the temperature in question . in @xcite however , one of the authors presented a version of the cluster algorithm @xcite that gives direct access to the interface free energy of ising systems ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the crossings of @xmath2 converge even faster than the crossings of the fourth - order cumulant in the case of the 3d ising model on a simple cubic lattice .    in the present paper",
    "we show how the algorithm of refs .",
    "@xcite can be generalized to @xmath3-invariant vector models with @xmath17 and apply it to the 3d @xmath0 model on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the @xmath18-transition of helium from the fluid he - i phase to the superfluid he - ii phase at low temperature is supposed to share the 3d @xmath0 universality class .",
    "it is the experimentally best studied second - order phase transition .",
    "the superfluid density corresponds to the helicity modulus of the @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "the quoted error bars of the measured value @xmath19 @xcite are smaller than that of the theoretical predictions for the 3d @xmath0 universality class .",
    "banavar et al .",
    "@xcite conjectured that the 3d antiferromagnetic ( af ) three - state potts model belongs to the same universality class as the 3d @xmath0 model .",
    "ueno et al .",
    "@xcite implemented  favourable \" and  unfavourable \" boundary conditions for the 3d af 3-state potts model .",
    "they found that the corresponding @xmath2 is incompatible with that found for the 3d @xmath0 model .",
    "they also obtained an estimate for the critical exponent of the correlation length @xmath20 @xcite , which is not consistent with the exponent @xmath21 @xcite of the 3d 2-component @xmath22-theory .",
    "this result has to be compared with recent high - precision studies of the 3d af 3-state potts model @xcite , where the @xmath0 exponents and critical amplitudes where recovered to high accuracy . to clarify this point",
    "we discuss how antiperiodic boundary conditions can be implemented for the 3d af 3-state potts model .",
    "our numerical findings are then compared with the 3d @xmath0 results .",
    "we consider a simple cubic lattice with extension @xmath8 in all directions . the uppermost layer of the lattice is regarded as the lower neighbour plane of the lower - most plane .",
    "an analogous identification is done for the other two lattice directions .",
    "the @xmath3 model is defined by the classical hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 are unit - vectors with @xmath25 components . when periodic @xmath26 boundary conditions @xmath27 are employed , then @xmath28 for all nearest - neighbour pairs .",
    "when antiperiodic @xmath29 boundary conditions are employed , then @xmath30 for bonds @xmath31 connecting the lower - most and uppermost plane of the lattice , while all other nearest - neighbour pairs keep @xmath32 . the free energy difference is now given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the partition functions with antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions respectively .    in order to obtain the ratio of partition functions @xmath36 we consider a system that allows both periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the partition function of this system is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the fraction of configurations with antiperiodic boundary conditions is given by the ratio @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 for antiperiodic boundary conditions and @xmath42 for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "an analogous result can be found for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "now we can express the ratio @xmath36 as a ratio of observables in this system , @xmath43 which is hence accessible in a single monte carlo simulation .",
    "we shall now describe an efficient algorithm to update the system explained above , where the type of boundary condition is a random variable @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on a standard cluster algorithm @xcite . for the ising model",
    "it can be explained as follows .",
    "first the bonds are deleted with the standard probability @xmath44 or else frozen . after deleting or freezing the bonds of the system one searches for an interface of deleted bonds that completely cuts the lattice in the @xmath45-direction .",
    "if there is such an interface , the spins between the bottom of the system and this interface and the sign of the coupling @xmath46 connecting top and bottom are flipped simultaneously .",
    "this is a valid update , since the bonds in the interface are deleted and the value of @xmath47 , for @xmath48 in the lowermost and @xmath49 in the uppermost plane , is not changed when we alter the sign of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    in order to apply this algorithm to @xmath3 models , each component of the spin must be considered as an embedded ising variable . in the delete probability , we just have to replace the ising spins by a given component of the @xmath3 spin .",
    "note that these embedded ising models do not couple with each other .",
    "the above boundary flips can be done independently for any component .",
    "the simplest approach would be to simulate an ensemble that contains also configurations , with different boundary conditions for the different components .",
    "however , we avoided these configurations with mixed boundary conditions .",
    "we only allowed a flip of the boundary condition , when it could be done for all components simultaneously .    in our simulations we alternate this boundary flip update with standard single - cluster updates @xcite .",
    "the three - state af potts model in three dimensions is defined by the partition function @xmath52 where the summation is taken over all nearest - neighbour pairs of sites @xmath48 and @xmath49 on a simple cubic lattice @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the reduced inverse temperature .",
    "one has to note that a change of the boundary interaction to a negative sign is incompatible with the symmetries of the classical hamiltonian .",
    "the change of the sign of @xmath55 from minus to plus would mean that there is only one favourable value of the neighbouring spin instead of two .",
    "hence changes in the free energy would also arise from a local distortion of the system .",
    "however , when one adds or removes one layer from the lattice , so that the extension in one direction , measured in units of lattice spacings , becomes an odd number , one obtains the global frustration we are aiming at .",
    "hence we define @xmath12 of an @xmath56 system by e(l , l , l ) = [ e(l , l , l+1)+e(l , l , l-1 ) ] - e(l , l , l ) , where the energy @xmath57 of the model is given by e = _ i , j _ _",
    "i , _ j .",
    "we were not able to find an efficient algorithm that adds or removes a layer of sites from the lattice .",
    "hence we had to rely on the standard integration method to obtain the corresponding @xmath2 for the potts model , as opposed to the @xmath0 model .",
    "on lattices of size @xmath58 and 64 , we performed simulations at @xmath59 , which is the estimate for the critical coupling obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "as explained above , we performed single cluster updates @xcite in addition to the boundary updates .",
    "we have chosen the number @xmath60 of the single cluster updates per boundary update such that @xmath60 times the average cluster volume is approximately equal to the lattice volume .",
    "we performed a measurement after each boundary update .",
    "the number of measurements was @xmath61 for all lattice sizes .",
    "first we determined the critical coupling @xmath62 using the crossings of @xmath63 .",
    "for the extrapolation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 to couplings @xmath38 other than the simulation coupling @xmath66 , we used the reweighting formula @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath48 labels the configurations generated according to the boltzmann weight at @xmath66 , @xmath68 denotes the boundary condition of the @xmath69 configuration , and @xmath70 must be replaced by either @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "we computed the statistical errors from jackknife binning @xcite applied to the ratio @xmath73 .",
    "the extrapolation gives good results only within a small neighbourhood of the simulation coupling @xmath66 .",
    "this range shrinks with increasing volume of the lattice",
    ". however , fig .",
    "1 shows that in a sufficiently large neighbourhood of the crossings of @xmath63 the extrapolation performs well .",
    "the results for the crossings are @xmath74 0.45439(22 ) , 0.45412(10 ) , 0.454138(31 ) , and 0.454147(14 ) , for @xmath75 4 and 8 , 8 and 16 , 16 and 32 , and 32 and 64 , respectively .",
    "the convergence of the crossings of @xmath63 towards @xmath62 is excellent .",
    "even with the high statistical accuracy that we reached , all crossings starting from @xmath76 and @xmath77 are compatible within error bars .",
    "the convergence of the crossings is governed by k_cross(l ) = k_c ( 1 + const .",
    "l^ -(+1/)+  ) , [ kcross ] where @xmath78 is the correction to scaling exponent @xcite .",
    "we performed a two - parameter fit with fixed @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite . taking all crossings we obtain @xmath81 and when discarding the @xmath76 and 8 crossing , we get @xmath82 , where both times the correction term is compatible with zero . note that we obtained @xmath83 @xcite ( or reanalysed @xmath84 @xcite ) from the crossing of the fourth - order cumulant . from the scaling behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility in the high - temperature phase we obtained @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "all these estimates are consistent within two standard deviations .    at the critical coupling",
    ", @xmath63 converges with increasing @xmath8 like ( l ) = ( ) ( 1 + const .",
    ". [ correction ] in table [ tab1 ] we give the value of @xmath63 at our estimate of the critical coupling .",
    "the result is stable with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "hence we take the result for @xmath86 , @xmath87 , as our final estimate for the infinite volume limit . taking the logarithm we obtain @xmath88 .",
    "we extracted the critical exponent @xmath1 of the correlation length from the @xmath8 dependence of the energy difference @xmath12 .",
    "the values for @xmath12 at the critical coupling are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we performed fits according to eq .",
    "( [ enerskal ] ) for the @xmath12 at the new estimate of the critical coupling and at the edges of the error bars .",
    "the results , which are summarized in table [ tab2 ] , are stable within the error bars , when we discard data with small @xmath8 from the fit .",
    "we take as our final result the fit including the lattice sizes @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , i.e. @xmath91 , where the error due to the uncertainty in the critical coupling is taken into account . performing",
    "a similar analysis at our old estimate for the critical coupling @xmath84 leads to @xmath92 , which is more consistent with the accurate value @xmath93 obtained @xcite from resummed perturbation theory .      for the 3d af three - state potts model we computed @xmath2 by the integration method . at @xmath94",
    "the free energy is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the number of lattice sites .",

    "in the large-@xmath8 limit , @xmath2 stays @xmath101 up to the critical point .",
    "therefore we started the integration at a @xmath38 such that we observed @xmath102 within our statistical accuracy for the larger lattices .",
    "for @xmath77 we measured @xmath12 at 67 different values of @xmath38 , starting at @xmath103 and going up in steps of @xmath104 until we reached @xmath100 .",

    "all runs consisted of @xmath108 measurements . per measurement",
    "we performed such a number of single cluster updates that the lattice volume was approximately covered by the average cluster volume .",
    "then we performed the integration using the trapeze rule .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "2 . the curves for @xmath76 and",
    "@xmath77 cross at @xmath109 and the curves for @xmath77 and @xmath105 at @xmath110 , which is in good agreement with @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath112 at @xmath113 are summarized in table 3 .",
    "our statistical accuracy degrades with increasing lattice size .",
    "hence we skipped the simulations of larger lattice sizes .",
    "however , already for the small lattices the results at @xmath113 are rather stable ; systematic errors due to corrections to scaling should be small .",
    "the result @xmath88 for @xmath105 at the critical point nicely agrees with our final result @xmath88 for the 3d @xmath0 model .",
    "one should note that for the 3d ising model one obtains @xmath114 @xcite , which is only a little more than half the @xmath0 value .",
    "at @xmath113 we simulated the @xmath115 and @xmath116 lattices for sizes up to @xmath86 with a statistics of @xmath61 measurements .",
    "for the cubic lattices we used the results of our previous study @xcite , where @xmath117 measurements had been performed .",
    "the resulting @xmath12 are summarized in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "we performed fits according to eq .",
    "( [ enerskal ] ) for the @xmath12 at the critical coupling and at the edges of the error bars .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "the fit including all lattice sizes gives an unacceptably large @xmath118 , which in the following will be denoted as @xmath119 .",
    "discarding the @xmath76 data the value of @xmath119 becomes acceptable , and when discarding also the @xmath77 data the result for @xmath120 remains stable within the error bars .",
    "hence we conclude that systematic errors due to corrections to scaling are smaller than our statistical errors .",
    "we take @xmath121 , from the fit including the lattice sizes @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as our final result , where the error due to the uncertainty in the critical coupling is taken into account .",
    "in the present work we have shown how the boundary algorithm of refs .",
    "@xcite can be applied to @xmath3 models with @xmath17 .",
    "we demonstrated , in the case of the 3d @xmath0 model , that its critical properties can be nicely extracted from the ratio of the partition functions @xmath63 .",
    "the accuracy of the results for the critical coupling and the critical exponent of the correlation length @xmath1 are compatible with that obtained from the fourth - order cumulant .",
    "we showed how antiperiodic boundary conditions can be implemented for the 3d af potts model .",
    "the value of the free energy difference @xmath122 at the critical coupling is in good agreement with that found for the 3d @xmath0 model .",
    "the value @xmath123 obtained from the scaling behaviour of the energy difference @xmath12 at the critical coupling is as accurate as our previous estimate , which we obtained from the slope of the fourth - order cumulant .",
    "we conclude that this strongly supports the fact that the 3d af 3-state potts model and the 3d @xmath0 model belong to the same universality class .",
    "the confirmation of the conjecture by banavar et al . also has practical implications .",
    "the 3d af 3-state potts model is simpler to simulate than the 3d @xmath0 model .",
