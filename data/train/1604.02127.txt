    "critical systems exhibit optimal computational properties , suggesting why the nervous system would benefit from such mode @xcite . for criticality ,",
    "certain control parameters need to be tuned , leading to the obvious question why and how this is achieved .",
    "this question is well known in statistical physics , the theory of self - organized criticality ( soc ) of homogeneous systems has a long history since the pioneering work of @xcite . in case of competing fast and",
    "slow processes soc systems can self - tune themselves in the neighborhood of a phase transition point @xcite .",
    "many simple homogeneous models have been suggested to describe power - laws ( pl ) and various other critical phenomena , very often without identifying soc responsible processes .",
    "alternatively , it has recently been proposed that living systems might also self - tune to criticality as the consequence of evolution and adaptation @xcite .",
    "real systems , however , are highly inhomogeneous and one must consider if heterogeneity is weak enough to use homogeneous models to heterogeneity is also called disorder in statistical physics and can lead to such rare - region ( rr ) effects that smear the phase transitions @xcite .",
    "rr - s can have various effects depending on their relevancy .",
    "they can change a discontinuous transition to a continuous one @xcite , or can generate so - called griffiths phases ( gp ) @xcite , or can completely smear a singular phase transition . in case of",
    "gp - s critical - like power - law dynamics appears over an extended region around the critical point , causing slowly decaying auto - correlations and burstyness @xcite .",
    "this behavior was proposed to be the reason for the working memory in the brain @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in gp the susceptibility is infinite for an entire range of control parameters near the critical point , providing a high sensitivity to stimuli , beneficial for information processing .",
    "therefore , studying the effects of heterogeneity is a very important issue in models of real system , in particular in neuroscience .",
    "it has been conjectured that network heterogeneity can cause gp - s if the topological ( graph ) dimension @xmath1 , defined by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of ( @xmath4 ) nodes within topological distance @xmath5 from an arbitrary origin ( @xmath6 ) , is finite @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis was pronounced for the contact process ( cp ) @xcite , but subsequent studies found numerical evidence for its validity in case of more general spreading models @xcite . recently gp has been reported in synthetic brain networks @xcite with finite @xmath1 . at first sight this seems to exclude relevant disorder effects in the so called small - world network models .",
    "however , in finite systems pls are observable in finite time windows for large random sample averages @xcite .",
    "very recently we have studied the topological behavior of large human connectome networks and found that contrary to the small world network coefficients they exhibit topological dimension slightly above @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is suggests weak long - range connections , in addition to the @xmath7 dimensional embedding ones and warrants to see heterogeneity effects in dynamical models defined on them .",
    "these graphs contain link weight connection data , thus one can study the combined effect of topological and interaction disorder , assuming a quasi static network .",
    "this work provides a numerical analysis based on huge data sets of the open connectome project ( ocp ) @xcite , obtained by diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) @xcite to describe _ structural brain connectivity . _ earlier studies of the structural networks were much smaller sized , for example the one obtained by sporns and collaborators , using diffusion imaging techniques @xcite , consists of a highly coarse - grained mapping of anatomical connections in the human brain , comprising @xmath8 brain areas and the fiber tract densities between them .",
    "the graph used here comprises @xmath9 nodes , allowing one to run extensive dynamical simulations on present days cpu / gpu clusters that can provide strong evidences for possible scaling behavior .",
    "it is essential to consider large connectomes , based on real experimental data , even if they are coarse grained and suffer from systematic errors and artifacts , because synthetic networks always rely on some subjective assumptions of the topologies .",
    "smaller systems near a singularity point of a phase transition , where the correlations may diverge suffer from finite size corrections , that can hide hide criticality or rare region effects .",
    "currently , connectomes can be estimated in humans at 1 @xmath10 scale , using a combination of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging , functional magnetic resonance imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans .",
    "the large graph `` kki-18 '' used here is generated by the migraine method as described in @xcite .",
    "note that ocp graphs are symmetric , weighted networks , obtained by image processing techniques , where the weights measure the number of fiber tracts between nodes .",
    "the investigated graph exhibits a single giant component of size @xmath11 nodes ( out of @xmath12 ) and several small sub - components , ignored here , to disregard an unrealistic brain network scenario .",
    "this graph has @xmath13 undirected edges , but to make it more realistic first i studied a diluted one , in which @xmath14 of the edges made directed by a random connection removal process .",
    "this directionality value is in between @xmath15 of @xcite and @xmath16 reported in @xcite .",
    "i shall discuss the relevancy of this edge asymmetry assumption .",

    "one can observe a pl region for @xmath19 with cutoff at large weights .",

    "this threshold model is similar to those of refs .",
    "the dynamical process is started by activating a randomly selected node . at each network update",
    "every ( @xmath6 ) node is visited and tested if the sum of incoming weights ( @xmath34 ) of active neighbors reaches a given threshold value @xmath35 if this condition is satisfied a node activation is attempted with probability @xmath36 .",
    "alternatively , an active node is deactivated with probability @xmath37 .",
    "new states of the nodes are overwritten only after a full network update , i.e. a synchronous update is performed at discrete time steps .",
    "the updating process continues as long as there are active sites or up to a maximum time limit @xmath38 monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) . in case the system is fallen to inactivity the actual time step is stored in order to calculate the survival probability @xmath39 of runs .",
    "the average activity : @xmath40 and the number of activated nodes during the avalanche @xmath41 of duration @xmath42 is calculated at the end of the simulations . this stochastic cellular automaton type of updating is not expected to affect the dynamical scaling behavior @xcite and provides a possibility for network - wise parallel algorithms .",
    "measurements on @xmath43 to @xmath44 independent runs , started from randomly selected , active initial sites were averaged over at each control parameter value .    by varying the control parameters , @xmath45 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 i attempted to find a critical point between an active and an absorbing steady state . at a critical transition point",
    "the survival probability is expected to scale asymptotically as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the survival probability exponent @xcite .",
    "this can be related to the avalanche ( total number of active sites during the spreading experiment ) duration scaling : @xmath48 , via the relation @xmath49 @xcite . in seed",
    "experiments the number of active sites initially grows as @xmath50 with the exponent @xmath51 , related to the avalanche size distribution @xmath52 , via the scaling law @xmath53 @xcite . to see corrections to scaling i also determined the local slopes of the dynamical exponents @xmath47 and @xmath51 as the discretized , logarithmic derivative of ( [ pscal ] ) and ( [ nscal ] ) .",
    "the effective exponent of @xmath47 is measured as @xmath54 using @xmath55 and similarly can one define @xmath56 .",
    "this difference selection has been found to be optimal in noise reduction versus effective exponent range @xcite .",
    "as the ocp graph is very inhomogeneous it appears that for a given set of control parameters only the hub nodes can be activated and the weakly coupled ones do not play any role .",
    "this is rather unrealistic and is against the local sustained activity requirement for the brain @xcite .",
    "indeed there is some evidence that neurons have certain adaptation to their input excitation levels @xcite and can be modeled by variable thresholds @xcite .",
    "this adaptation leading to some homeostasis can be assumed to be valid on the coarse grained , node level too . to model nodes with variable thresholds of equalized sensitivity",
    ", i modified the incoming weights by normalizing them as @xmath57 .",
    "although the update rules are unchanged i shall call such simulations `` variable threshold model '' studies .",
    "first i summarize results for related homogeneous system .",
    "it is well known that in branching and annihilating models with multi - particle ( @xmath58 ) reactions @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath61 the phase transition in the high dimensional , mean - field limit is first order type @xcite .",
    "considering the sum of occupied neighbors as the incoming activation potential , there is a sudden change in the balance of activation / deactivation possibilities as we approach the absorbing phase , since annihilation can occur unconditionally .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that for threshold models with @xmath62 , near and above the the upper critical dimension , which is expected to be @xmath63 , we observe discontinuous transitions .",
    "first i run the threshold model on an unweighted @xmath64-dimensional lattice with @xmath65 nodes and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "i tested the low : @xmath66 threshold cases , being the most possible candidates for the occurrence of pl dynamics .",
    "however , for high branching probability ( @xmath67 ) , where an efficient neural network should work , an exponentially fast evolution to the inactive state occurred for any @xmath68 . on the other hand for @xmath69",
    "the survival probability remains finite , but the transition is very sharp , in agreement with the results of @xcite and we can not find pl dynamics .    in case of various quenched heterogenities a similar model , the cp has recently been studied on 3-dimensional lattices with diluted disorder in @xcite .",
    "extensive computer simulations gave numerical evidence for nonuniversal power laws typical of a griffiths phase as well as activated scaling at criticality .",
    "the disorder , generated by the addition of long - range connections has also been found to be relevant in case of cp and threshold models in one @xcite and two dimensions @xcite , provided the probability of connections fell quickly enough i. e. : @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "this means that in case of a @xmath7 systems the graph dimension remains finite and gp may be expected if @xmath72 .",
    "however , in a real connectome we can not investigate these heterogenities separately .",
    "next , i performed simulations of the threshold model on the kki-18 graph with @xmath73 , since for larger @xmath45-s we do nt expect criticality .",
    "again , temporal functions did not show pl behavior .",
    "instead , one can observe an exponentially fast drop of @xmath39 to zero or to some finite value , depending on the control parameters .",
    "discontinuous transition occurs at very low @xmath36-s , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "therefore , the heterogeneity of the ocp graph is not strong enough to round the discontinuous transition , observed on the homogeneous lattice unlike in case of the models in @xcite .",
    "it appears that hubs , with large @xmath74 , determine the behavior of the whole system , while other nodes do not play a role .",
    "these hubs keep the system active or inactive , ruling out the occurrence of local rr effects as in case of infinite dimensional networks @xcite .      to test this , i turned towards the simulations of variable threshold models .",
    "the control parameter space was restricted by fixing @xmath75 , which mimics an efficient brain model .",
    "transitions could be found for @xmath76 , for higher thresholds the models evolve to inactive phase for any @xmath37-s . for the time being i set @xmath77 .",
    "[ s2wlsw ] suggests a phase transition at @xmath78 and @xmath79 , above which @xmath39 curves evolve to finite constant values .",

    "the straight lines on the log .",

    "neural variability make the brain more efficient @xcite , therefore one must consider its effect in modelling . to study this large scale dynamical simulations have been performed on a human connectome model .",
    "the heterogenities of an ocp graph are too weak to change the dynamical behavior of the threshold model of a homogeneous 3d lattice .",
    "this seems to be true for other spreading models , like the contact process @xcite . in relative threshold models , defined by normalizing the incoming weights ,",
    "griffiths effects have been found for extended control parameter spaces .",
    "the inclusion of a @xmath14 edge directness does not affect the results qualitatively , reflecting insensitivity to some potential artifacts of dti , like polarity detection .",
    "random removal of connections emulates the effect of ( unknown ) noise in the data generation and since the majority of edges is short , this procedure results in a relative enhancement of long connections , which is known to be underestimated by the dti @xcite . scaling exponents on undirected ocps vary in the range @xmath132 and @xmath114 , close to neural experimental values @xcite .",
    "effects of other less relevant systematic errors and artifacts have not been investigated here .",
    "radial accuracy affects , for example , the end point of the tracts , thus it influences the hierarchical levels of cortical organization . @xcite .",
    "the present ocp exhibits hierarchical levels by construction from the desikan regions with ( at least ) two quite different scales .",
    "preliminary studies @xcite suggest that rr effects are enhanced by modularity , but not too much by the hierarchy .",
    "transverse accuracy determines which cortical area is connected to which other .",
    "however , achieving fine - grained transverse accuracy is difficult for dti , not only because of limited spatial resolution , but also because present measures are noisy and indirect . we may expect that lack of precise connection pathways are not relevant for griffiths effects as long as they do not affect the graph dimension for example .",
    "the introduction of @xmath133 of inhibitory links , selected randomly , results in griffiths effects with avalanche size and time exponents , which scatter around the experimental figures .",
    "the exponents depend slightly on the control parameters as the consequence of rr effects .",
    "strong and oscillating corrections to scaling are also observable as the result of the modular structure of the connectome .    as an earlier study @xcite showed certain level of universality in the topological features : degree distributions , graph dimensions , clustering and small world coefficients of the ocp graphs , one can expect the same dynamical behavior and griffiths effects of these models on ocp graphs in general .",
    "this expectation is supported further by the robustness of the results for random changing of the network details : inhibitory links , directedness or loss of connections up to @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , one can safely take it granted that the investigated connectome describes well similar ones available currently and can be considered as a useful prototype for numerical analysis .",
    "it is important to note that while some rough tuning of the control parameters might be necessary to get closer to the critical point , one can see dynamical criticality even _ below a phase transition point",
    "_ without external activation , which is a safe expectation for brain systems @xcite .",
    "recent experiments suggest slightly sub - critical brain states in vivo , devoid of dangerous over - activity linked to epilepsy .",
    "one may debate the assumption of relative thresholds , that was found to be necessary to see slow dynamics .",
    "this introduces disassortativity , enhancing rr effects @xcite , besides the modularity @xcite .",
    "however , inhibitory links increase the heterogeneity so drastically , that a full equalization of the internal sensitivity may not be obligatory condition for finding griffiths effects",
    ". this will be the target of further studies .",
    "probably the most important result of this study is that negative weights enable local sustained activity and promote strong rr effects without network fragmentation .",
    "thus connectomes with high graph dimensions can be subject to rr effects and can show measurable griffiths effects .",
    "another important observation is that pl - s may occur in a single network , without sample averaging , due to the modular topological structure .",
