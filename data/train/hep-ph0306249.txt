    "the radiative decays of the @xmath0 into @xmath1 and @xmath4 have been the subject of intense study @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is the hope that one can get much information about the nature of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances from the invariant mass distribution of the two mesons .",
    "the nature of the scalar meson resonances has generated a large debate @xcite , to which new light has been brought by the claim that these resonances are dynamically generated from multiple scattering with the ordinary chiral lagrangians @xcite .",
    "these two reactions involving the decay of the @xmath0 are special .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 does not decay into two pions because of isospin symmetry .",
    "a way to circumvent this handicap is to allow the @xmath0 to decay into two charged kaons ( with a photon attached to one of them ) and the two kaons to scatter giving rise to the two pions ( or @xmath3 ) .",
    "the loop which appears diagrammatically is proved to be finite using arguments of gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the radiative @xmath0 decay through this mechanism was studied in @xcite and the results of lowest order chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7 ) were used to account for the @xmath8 transition . since the chiral perturbation theory @xmath9 amplitude does not account for the @xmath5 , the excitation of this resonance has to be taken in addition , something that has been done more recently using a linear sigma - model in @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite leads to the excitation of the @xmath5 in the @xmath10 production , or the @xmath6 in @xmath3 production in a natural way , since the use of unitarized chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath11 ) , as in @xcite , generates automatically those resonances in the meson meson scattering amplitudes and one does not have to introduce them by hand .",
    "the experimental situation has also experienced an impressive progress recently . to the already statistically significant experiments at novosibirsk",
    "@xcite one has added the new , statistically richer , experiments at frascati @xcite which allow one to test models beyond the qualitative level . in this sense",
    "although the predictions of the work of @xcite , using @xmath12 with no free parameters , provided a good agreement with the experimental data of @xcite , thus settling the dominant mechanism as that coming from chiral kaon loops from the @xmath13 decay , the new and more precise data leave room for finer details which we evaluate in this paper .",
    "one of the issues concerning radiative decays is the relevance of the sequential vector meson mechanisms .",
    "the anomalous vector - vector - pseudoscalar couplings @xcite , followed by the coupling of the photon to the vector mesons through vector meson dominance , allows mechanisms for reactions of the type that we study , through a sequential @xmath14 process .",
    "this mechanism is known to provide the @xmath15 radiative width with accuracy @xcite and has been further extended to study @xmath16 and other radiative decays in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found that in the latter reaction the sequential vector meson mechanism and the loops ( in this case charged pion loops ) were equally important , and the consideration of the two mechanisms produced a width compatible with the recent experimental determination of the snd collaboration @xcite . since the @xmath17 is ozi forbidden , the contribution from the sequential vector meson mechanism should be small and it was not considered till recently @xcite .",
    "it proceeds via @xmath18 mixing , which is indeed small , but still noticeable in the radiative @xmath0 decay width .    in the present paper",
    "we also take into account this sequential mechanism , but in addition we consider the final state interaction of the two mesons within the framework of @xmath19 . furthermore , in the line of considering the final state interaction ( fsi ) of the mesons we also allow the sequential vector meson production of kaons , which interact among themselves and lead to the final two mesons .",
    "this is easily implemented in the coupled channel formalism of @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms involving final state interaction all contribute to the production of the @xmath5 or @xmath6 resonances , since the resonance poles appear in the coupled channel formalism in all the elastic or transition matrix elements .",
    "another novelty of the present work is the consideration of sequential mechanisms involving the exchange of an intermediate axial - vector meson ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) , both producing directly the final meson pair or through the intermediate production of kaons which undergo collisions and produce these mesons .",
    "all the mechanisms considered here contribute moderately , but appreciably , to the @xmath0 radiative width .",
    "the inclusion of all these mechanisms leads to results compatible with the experimental data of frascati , particularly if theoretical uncertainties are considered , which is something also done in the present work .",
    "the good agreement with experiment is reached in spite of having in our approach a width for the @xmath5 very small , of the order of 30 mev , seemingly in contradiction with the visual @xmath5 width in the experiment , which looks much larger .",
    "the reason for this has been recently discussed in @xcite and stems from the fact that , due to gauge invariance , the amplitude for the process contains as a factor the momentum of the photon , which grows fast as we move down to smaller invariant masses of the two pseudoscalars from the mass of the @xmath5 where the photon momentum is very small .",
    "this distorts the shape of the resonance , making it appear wider .",
    "we shall see that our approach , which respects gauge invariance , introduces automatically this factor in the amplitudes .",
    "we shall see that there is some discrepancy of the theoretical results with the data at small two meson invariant masses .",
    "we shall discuss this feature , realizing that the results resemble very much the raw data , before the analysis is done to subtract the contribution of @xmath22 and to correct for the experimental acceptance .",
    "furthermore , some of the assumptions made in the analysis of @xcite might be questionable .",
    "the mechanism for radiative decay using the tensor formulation for the vector mesons has been discussed in @xcite and we briefly summarize it here .",
    "the diagrams considered are depicted in fig .",
    "[ looplot ] , where the loops contain @xmath24 .",
    "the vertices needed for the diagrams are obtained from the chiral lagrangian    @xmath25    where the notation is defined in @xcite .",
    "we also assume ideal mixing between the @xmath0 and the @xmath26    @xmath27    and the matrix @xmath28 is then given by    @xmath29    the amplitude for the radiative decay can be written as @xmath30 , and lorentz covariance demands @xmath31 to be of the type    @xmath32    where @xmath33 are the @xmath0 and photon momenta respectively . gauge invariance @xmath34 forces @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "[ looplot ] contribute . since two powers of momenta correspond to @xmath40 the loop integrals with the remaining momenta are actually convergent @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath41 amplitude is separated into the on shell part ( setting @xmath42 for the internal lines ) and the off shell remainder , it was proved in @xcite that this latter part does not contribute to the @xmath38 coefficient .",
    "this information is of much value , since it allows to factorize the on shell meson meson amplitude outside the loop integral .",

    "we find @xmath69 but this value would be @xmath70 higher from @xmath71 .",
    "it is interesting to recall that when the iteration of loops implicit in the bs equation is used to evaluate pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors in @xcite one finds a universal value for @xmath72 and similarly @xmath73 .",
    "since here we use a similar formalism to the one used in @xcite the use of this latter values of the constants according to the approach used gives us an indication of the level of uncertainty in these parameters .",
    "we thus take for the calculations @xmath74 and @xmath75 .      following the lines of @xcite in the study of @xmath76 and @xmath26",

    "they are depicted in fig .  2 , where we explicitly assume that the @xmath77 proceeds via the @xmath78 mixing .",
    "in order to evaluate these diagrams we use the same lagrangians as in @xcite    @xmath79    where @xmath80 means @xmath81 trace , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath28 @xmath85 the vector ( pseudoscalar ) @xmath81 matrices and @xmath86 is taken positive .",

    "the parameter with the larger contribution to the error band turns out to be the @xmath54 since the largest contribution , chiral kaon loops form @xmath68 decay , is roughly proportional to @xmath54 ( up to the term with @xmath153 in eq .",

    "[ fig : res7 ] we can see that our results , considering the error band , fairly agree with the experimental data except in the region around @xmath156 .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy will be further discussed in section [ sectionmanolo ] .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : res8 ] we show the contribution of the chiral loops from @xmath68 decay ( dashed - dotted line ) together with the sequential vmd at tree level ( dotted line ) and the loops of the sequential vmd involving kaons ( dashed line ) . in the solid line",

    "the vmd mechanism involving @xmath158 creation followed by @xmath159 fsi is negligible and , therefore , is not shown in the figure .",
    "we can see that the kaon loops of the sequential vmd mechanism give a very important contribution , in contrast to the @xmath23 case where the important contribution of the vmd sequential loops was the one involving pions . recall that the reason for the small contribution of kaon loops in the vmd mechanism for @xmath23 was the accidental cancellation of the @xmath0 and @xmath26 contributions ( for the @xmath0 and @xmath26 attached to the photon ) .",
    "however , in this case there is only the @xmath76 attached to the photon and thus the contribution of this term is large , as was also the case in @xmath23 for the individual contributions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : res9 ] we show the contribution of the mechanisms with intermediate @xmath160 ( solid line ) and @xmath161 ( dashed line ) .",

    "[ fig : res11 ] we show the different relevant contributions when they are added one by one .",
    "the dotted line represents the chiral loops by themselves . in the dashed line",
    "we have added the contribution of the sequential vmd mechanisms together with the loops involving the fsi of the mesons .",
    "finally , in solid line we have add the contribution of the axial - vector contributions .",
    "this latter curve represents the full model . in this figure",
    "we can see the importance of the loop mechanism involving kaons and the nonnegligible contribution of the mechanisms with axial - vector mesons in intermediate states .",

    "we can see that when these uncertainties are considered we obtain a theoretical band in acceptable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the total width and branching ratio obtained are    @xmath164    to be compared with the experimental values    @xmath165",
    "we would like to comment on the strength that we obtain around @xmath156 in the @xmath108 invariant mass distribution in the @xmath23 decay which appears in contradiction with the experimental analysis .",
    "as we saw it comes from accumulation of the novel mechanisms which we have discussed in our paper .",
    "such mechanisms are not considered in other theoretical papers which find a good agreement with the data .",
    "for instance in @xcite a good reproduction of the data is obtained using a linear sigma model with @xmath166 and @xmath5 included in the calculation and some free parameter to adjust to the data .",
    "in @xcite an attempt to make a model independent calculation is done by parametrizing amplitudes compatible with analyticity and gauge invariance and , through a fit to data , a set of parameters leading to agreement with the data is obtained . in @xcite the same approach for the chiral kaon loops from @xmath68 decay as in the present paper is followed , but in addition a contact term in @xmath167 is added and , fitting the strength of this term to the data , a good agreement with the experimental results is also found .",
    "our philosophy has been different and we have not fitted any parameter to the @xmath0 radiative decay data but simple have considered the different mechanisms that can sizeable contribute to the process .",
    "an acceptable agreement with the data is found in the region of the @xmath5 , which is the most important issue concerning this reaction .",
    "this is not trivial a priori in view of the very small width of the dynamically generated @xmath5 ( around @xmath168 ) that one obtains in the model of @xcite that we use here and the large visual width of the @xmath5 peak in the present experiment .",
    "part of the reason for the agreement comes from the @xmath169 factor ( photon momentum ) in the amplitude , as requirement by gauge invariance and emphasize in @xcite , which gives more weight to the amplitude as we move down in the @xmath107 invariant mass from the upper limit ( where @xmath170 ) .",
    "however , as seen in our results , the inclusion of the new mechanisms and their interference with the dominant one , particularly the contribution of the axial - vector meson exchange mechanisms , also contributes to the widening of the distribution around the @xmath5 peak .",
    "although the agreement with data at low masses is not very good , we must point out two sources of uncertainty in the experimental spectrum .",
    "first , the results in the low and intermediate mass region largely depend on the background subtraction dominated by the non - resonant @xmath22 process .",
    "the size of this process is difficult to obtain because it has a strong background itself , mostly from the @xmath171 process , as it is discussed in @xcite .",
    "there , its magnitude has been obtained in a model dependent way assuming some a priori spectrum for the @xmath171 process @xcite .",
    "in fact , before the subtraction , the raw data resemble much more our calculated spectrum , ( see fig . 4 from @xcite ) , and we could think of a slightly smaller @xmath22 background .    additionally , there is some uncertainty in the way the data are corrected to account for the experimental efficiency .",
    "this is done in @xcite by dividing the observed spectrum by the effect of applying the experimental efficiency on some theoretical distribution .",
    "this unfolding procedure depends on the theoretical model used , which we think at low @xmath108 masses is at least incomplete .",
    "in fact , with the unfolding method used , the zero value of the spectrum obtained with the theoretical model of @xcite implies unavoidably a zero value for the corrected experimental results .",
    "a reanalysis to the light of the present discussion would be most welcome .",
    "we have studied the radiative decay of the @xmath0 into two neutral pseudoscalars , @xmath108 , @xmath130 , and a photon . we have taken an approach to study the process addressing mechanisms proved to be relevant in the study of the radiative decays of the @xmath76 and the @xmath26 .",
    "these include the kaon loops from the @xmath68 decay and mechanisms of sequential vector meson steps with vertices of the type @xmath172 , together with vector meson dominance to couple a vector meson to the photon .",
    "in addition to these mechanisms studied before we have added the final state interaction in the sequential vector meson mechanisms , allowing for rescattering of the @xmath108 or @xmath130 states .",
    "simultaneously we also allowed kaons to be produced in the sequential vector meson processes , followed by the interaction of the kaons to lead to the final @xmath108 or @xmath130 states .",
    "these latter mechanisms have the advantage over the tree level sequential vector meson mechanism that they are not ozi forbidden .",
    "we found these kaon loop contributions to be individually large , although they become small in the @xmath23 decay due to an accidental cancellation of two terms , and they are very important in the @xmath157 decay .",
    "another addition in the present work is the contribution of sequential axial - vector mechanisms involving two sequential @xmath173 steps followed by the coupling of a vector meson to the photon , and even more important the production of @xmath174 through these mechanisms followed by final state interaction of the kaons to give @xmath108 or @xmath130 in the final state .",
    "the final state interaction of pairs of mesons involving diagrams with loops has been done using techniques of unitarized chiral perturbation theory which allow one to study meson meson interaction in coupled channels up to @xmath175gev and hence are particularly suitable for the present reaction .",
    "the main contribution to the radiative @xmath0 decay is the loop mechanisms involving the interaction of @xmath176 coming from @xmath0 decay , which by itself reproduces qualitatively the experiment as it was already shown in @xcite .",
    "however , the new mechanisms studied here are by no means negligible .",
    "altogether we find a good agreement with experiment , particularly when the study of the theoretical uncertainties is done .",
    "these theoretical uncertainties , stemming from errors in the magnitudes used as input to determine the parameters of the theory , are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental ones .",
    "apart from these uncertainties we should stress that there is no freedom in the theory used .",
    "there are no free parameters which have been adjusted to the @xmath23 and @xmath157 data studied here .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data both for @xmath108 and @xmath130 channel is remarkable and less than trivial when one realizes that a change of sign in one of the mechanisms leads to opposite interference effects and to results in not so good agreement with the data .",
    "the agreement is more remarkable , or surprising , when one realizes that this agreement with the data is reached for the @xmath177 case , in spite of having an @xmath5 resonance that has a width much smaller than the apparent width that one could guess from the @xmath23 experiment , and which one would get fitting the data with models less elaborate than the present one . some explanation for this can be already seen in @xcite which remarked that the requirement of gauge invariance in the amplitude introduces the factor of the photon momentum which tends to widen the distribution of the invariant mass around the @xmath5 peak .",
    "our approach is manifestly gauge invariant and one can show explicitly in all the terms that this factor appears .",
    "our approach comes to stress the point of view of @xcite that the apparent width of the @xmath5 in the experimental data of this reaction can not be used as an direct measure of the actual @xmath5 width .",
    "the main conclusion of the work is that a theoretical approach to the problem of the @xmath23 and @xmath157 decays is possible by using the chiral unitary approach used successfully to reproduce the @xmath107 data up to @xmath175gev and many other physical processes @xcite . as we could see along the work ,",
    "the @xmath5 or @xmath6 have not been explicitly coupled to the @xmath0 , meaning that there is no direct @xmath178 coupling .",
    "this is in accordance with the philosophy of the chiral unitary approach about these two resonances which are dynamically generated by the meson meson interaction .",
    "this has as a consequence that in processes where these resonances are produced one should not include them explicitly in the approach but they should appear naturally as soon as the meson are allowed to interact . in this sense",
