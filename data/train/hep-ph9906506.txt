    "the effective lagrangian is a model ",
    "independent approach to describe new physics that is expected to manifest itself at an energy scale @xmath0 , larger than the scale where the experiments are performed .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be constructed out of higher dimensional operators and depends only on the particle content of the low energy theory .",
    "we consider here the possibility of having a light higgs boson that should be contained in these operators .",
    "hence , we assume a linearly realized @xcite @xmath1 invariant effective lagrangian to describe the bosonic sector of the sm , keeping the fermionic sector unchanged .",
    "there are eleven dimension6 operators involving the gauge bosons and the higgs scalar field which respect local @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 symmetries @xcite .",
    "six of these operators either affect only the higgs self  interactions or contribute to the gauge boson two  point functions at tree level and are severely constrained from low energy physics below the present sensitivity of high energy experiments @xcite . from the remaining five `` blind '' operators ,",
    "four affect the higgs couplings and can be written as @xcite , @xmath5   \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the higgs field doublet , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the field strength tensors of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 gauge fields respectively .",
    "anomalous @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 couplings are generated by ( [ lagrangian ] ) , which modify the higgs boson production and decay @xcite . in the unitary gauge",
    "they are given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the effective couplings @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are related to the coefficients of the operators appearing in ( 1 ) and can be found elsewhere @xcite",
    ". of special interest in our analysis is the higgs couplings to two photons which is given by @xmath23    equation ( [ lagrangian ] ) also generates new contributions to the triple gauge boson vertex @xcite . the operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 give rise to both anomalous higgs  gauge boson couplings and to new triple and quartic self ",
    "couplings amongst the gauge bosons . on the other hand @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 only affect @xmath28 couplings and can not be constrained by the study of anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings .",
    "[ t ! ]    all processes listed in ( [ proc ] ) have been the object of direct experimental searches , and in our analysis we have closely followed theses searches in order to make our study as realistic as possible . in this way",
    "we start by the process @xmath34 @xcite to constrain the anomalous higgs boson couplings described in ( [ h ] ) .",
    "d  collaboration reported the results for the search of high invariant  mass photon pairs in @xmath35 events @xcite at @xmath36 tev and @xmath37 pb@xmath38 of integrated luminosity where no event with two  photon invariant mass in the range @xmath39 were observed . in our analysis",
    ", we applied the same cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite and included the particle identification and trigger efficiencies .",
    "we have searched for higgs boson with mass in the range @xmath40 , since after the @xmath41 threshold is reached the diphoton branching ratio of higgs is quite reduced .    for events containing two photons plus large missing transverse energy ( @xmath42 ) @xcite we have used",
    "the results from d  collaborations @xcite which reported that no event with two  photon invariant mass in the range @xmath43 was observed .",
    "anomalous higgs couplings can give rise to this final state via the contributions listed in the second column , third line of eq.([proc ] ) where in the second subprocess the charged lepton ( @xmath44 = e , \\mu$ ] ) escapes undetected . in order to compare our predictions with the results of d  collaboration @xcite",
    ", we have applied the same cuts of last article in ref .",
    "after these cuts , we find that 80% to 90% of the signal comes from associated higgs@xmath29 production while 10% to 20% arrises from higgs@xmath45 .",
    "we also include in our analysis the particle identification and trigger efficiencies which vary from 40% to 70% per photon .",
    "we have also analysed events with three photons in the final state and compare our results with the recent search reported by cdf collaboration @xcite for this signature .",
    "they looked for @xmath46 events requiring two photons in the central region of the detector , with a minimum transverse energy of 12 gev , plus an additional photon with @xmath47 gev .",
    "the photons were required to be separated by more than @xmath48 .    finally , for events containing three photons in the final state at electron ",
    "positron collisions @xcite , we have used the recent opal results @xcite where data taken at several energy points in the range @xmath49  @xmath50 gev were combined .    we have included in our calculations all sm ( qcd plus electroweak ) , and anomalous contributions that lead to these final states . the sm one - loop contributions to the @xmath13 and @xmath51",
    "vertices were introduced through the use of the effective operators with the corresponding form factors in the coupling .",
    "neither the narrow  width approximation for the higgs boson contributions , nor the effective @xmath45 boson approximation were employed .",
    "we consistently included the effect of all interferences between the anomalous signature and the sm background .",
    "for @xmath52 processes , we have used the mrs ( g ) @xcite set of proton structure functions with the scale @xmath53 .    [ t ! ]",
    "the coupling @xmath13 ( [ g ] ) involves @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite . in consequence , the anomalous signature @xmath56",
    "is only possible when those couplings are not vanishing .",
    "the couplings @xmath57 and @xmath58 , on the other hand , affect the production mechanisms for the higgs boson . in fig .",
    "[ fig1].a we present our results for the excluded region in the @xmath54 , @xmath55 plane from the different channels studied for @xmath59 gev , assuming that these are the only non  vanishing couplings . since the anomalous contribution to @xmath13 is zero for @xmath60 ( see eq .  [ g ] ) , the bounds become very weak close to this line , as is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in order to establish these bounds",
    ", we imposed an upper limit on the number of signal events based on poisson statistics . in the absence of background",
    "this implies @xmath61 at 64% ( 95% ) cl . in the presence of background events , we employed the modified poisson analysis .",
    "the results obtained from the analysis of the four reactions ( [ proc ] ) can be statistically combined in order to constrain the value of the coefficients @xmath62 , @xmath63 of ( [ lagrangian ] ) @xcite .",
    "we exhibit in fig.[fig1].b the 95% cl exclusion region in the plane @xmath64 obtained from combined results .    in order to reduce the number of free parameters",
    "one can make the assumption that all blind operators affecting the higgs interactions have a common coupling @xmath65 , _ i.e. _ @xmath66 @xcite . in fig [ kappa ] , we present the combined limits for the coupling constant @xmath67 for higgs boson masses in the range of @xmath68 gev .",
    "the effect of the anomalous operators becomes more evident with the increase of energy , and therefore , higher sensitive to smaller values of the anomalous coefficients can be achieved by studying their contribution to different processes at the upgraded tevatron collider .",
    "we have considered the tevatron run ii upgrade , with 1 fb@xmath38 , and the tev33 upgrade with 10 fb@xmath38 . for the reactions @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ", we assumed the same cuts and detection efficiencies than at tevatron run i. for the @xmath46 final state we have studied the improvement on the sensitivity to the anomalous coefficients by implementing additional kinematical cuts @xcite .",
    "best results are obtained for the following set of cuts : @xmath71 gev , with @xmath72 gev , where we have ordered the three photons according to their transverse energy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath73 .",
    "we always required the photons to be in the central region of the detector ( @xmath74 ) where there is sensitivity for electromagnetic showering . in our estimate",
    ", we assumed the same detection efficiency for photons as considered by cdf collaboration @xcite for the run i.          0.5 cm summarizing , we have estimated the limits on anomalous dimension ",
    "six higgs boson interactions that can be derived from the investigation of three photon events at lep2 and tevatron and diphoton plus missing transverse energy events or dijets at tevatron . under the assumption that the coefficients of the four `` blind '' effective operators contributing to higgs ",
    "vector boson couplings are of the same magnitude , the study can give rise to a significant indirect limit on anomalous @xmath76 couplings .",
    "we have also studied the expected improvement on the sensitivity to higgs anomalous couplings at the fermilab tevatron upgrades .",
