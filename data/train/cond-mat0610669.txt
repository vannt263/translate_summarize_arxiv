    "it is the latter domain that will interest us here .    in studies performed in such systems",
    "one has found remarkable _ statistical regularities _ , in the sense that the probability distribution for various macroscopic quantities involves a rather small number of relevant physical parameters , or scaling parameters , while the rest of the microscopic details serves as mere  scaffolding \" . in ref . @xcite it was shown that a limiting distribution of physical quantities indeed arises in the so called _ dense - weak - scattering limit _ ( dwsl ) and within a particular class of models : the individual , microscopic , scattering units were defined through their transfer matrices and an  isotropic \" distribution of their phases was assumed .",

    "the motivation of the present paper is to _ derive _ from a potential model the statistical properties of the bb and use them to find the  evolution \" with length of the expectation value of physical quantities .",
