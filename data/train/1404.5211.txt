    "a precise knowledge of the number of unidentified gamma - ray sources ( ugss ) is extremely relevant since for example it could help to provide the tightest constraint on the dark matter models ever determined @xcite .",

    "the number of ugss is therefore to recognize those that could be blazars .",
    "blazars are the rarest class of active galactic nuclei , dominated by variable , non - thermal radiation over the entire electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their observational properties are generally interpreted in terms of a relativistic jet aligned within a small angle to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "blazars have been classified as bl lacs and fsrqs ( or bzbs and bzqs according to the nomenclature proposed by @xcite ) , with the latter showing similar optical spectra except for the stronger emission lines , as well as higher radio polarization .",
    "in particular , if the only spectral features observed are emission lines with rest frame equivalent width @xmath7   the object is classified as a bzb @xcite , otherwise it is classified as bzq @xcite .",
    "systematic projects aimed at obtaining optical spectroscopic observations of blazars are currently carried out by different groups ( see , e.g. , ; ] @xcite ) .",
    "the blazar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) typically show two peaks : one in the range of radio - soft x - rays , due to synchrotron emission by highly relativistic electrons within the jet ; and another one at hard x - ray or @xmath6-ray energies , interpreted as inverse compton upscattering by the same electrons of the seed photons provided by the synchrotron emission @xcite with the possible addition of seed photons from outside the jets yielding contributions to the non - thermal radiations due to external inverse compton scattering ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) often dominating the @xmath6-ray outputs .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed an association procedure to recognize @xmath6-ray blazar candidates on the basis of their positions in the three - dimensional wise color space . as a matter of fact , blazars",

    ", @xcite recently identified thirteen gamma - ray emitting blazar candidates from a sample of 102 previously unidentified sources selected from astronomer s telegrams and the literature .",
    "@xcite applied the classification method proposed by @xcite to 258 ugss and 210 active galaxies of uncertain type ( agus ) listed in the 2fgl @xcite finding candidate blazar counterparts for 141 ugss and 125 agus . the classification method proposed by @xcite , however ,",
    "can only be applied to sources detected in all 4 wise bands , i.e. , 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath8 m .",
    "using the x - ray emission in place of the 22 @xmath8 m detection , @xcite proposed a method to select @xmath6-ray blazar candidates among _",
    "swift_-xrt sources considering those that feature a wise counterpart detected at least in the first 3 bands , and with ir colors compatible with the 90% two - dimensional densities of known @xmath6-ray blazar evaluated using the kernel density estimation ( kde ) technique ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) , so selecting 37 new @xmath6-ray blazar candidates .",
    "similarly , using the radio emission as additional information , @xcite investigated all the radio sources in nvss and sumss surveys that lie within positional uncertainty region of _ fermi _ ugss and , considering those sources with ir colors compatible with the 90% two - dimensional kde densities of known @xmath6-ray blazar , selected 66 additional @xmath6-ray blazar candidates .    finally , @xcite investigated the low - frequency radio emission of blazars and searched for sources with similar features combining the information derived from the wenss and nvss surveys , identifying 26 @xmath6-ray candidate blazars in the _ fermi _ lat the positional uncertainty region of 21 ugss .",
    "in this paper we present a pilot project to assess the effectiveness of the three methods described before ( position in the three dimensional wise ir colors space , radio or x - ray detection plus position in the two dimensional wise ir color space and low - frequency radio properties ) in selecting gamma - ray blazar candidates . to this end , we report on optical spectra acquired using mmt , loiano and oan telescopes of 5 wise @xmath6-ray blazar candidates - counterparts of three ugss and two agus - in order to identify their nature and to test the reliability of these different approaches in selecting @xmath6-ray candidate blazars .",
    "in addition , we also present optical spectra of 4 known @xmath6-ray blazars with uncertain redshift estimates or unknown classification ( bzb vs bzq , ) @xcite with a wise counterpart identified by @xcite .",
    "we note that our approach in selecting the targets for our observations is different from that adopted in other works ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that is , selecting the source closest to radio or optical coordinates .",
    "our approach for the target selection , as reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , is the following :    * for _ fermi _ ugss or agus , among all the sources inside the 95% lat uncertainty region ( @xmath9 ) we select gamma - ray blazar candidates on the basis of their multi - wavelength properties ( ir , radio+ir , x - ray+ir , low - frequency radio ) . as a consequence ,",
    "our selected targets are not necessarily the closest to optical or radio coordinates .",
    "they may - in principle - not even have a radio counterpart . * for known",
    "gamma - ray blazars @xcite associate to roma - bzcat @xcite sources the closest wise source inside 3.3  selected on the basis of its wise colors .",
    "so , even if the these source are spatially compatible with radio or optical coordinates due to the wise psf extension ( @xmath10  in w1 band and @xmath11  in w4 band , @xcite ) , we can not a - priori be sure that this ir source is actually the blazar counterpart .",
    "since the probability of having two different blazars in 3.3  is essentially 0 ( the blazar density in the sky is about 1 source per 10 square degrees ) , if the selected wise source does show a blazar spectrum we can be confident that this is indeed the ir blazar counterpart and that @xcite procedure correctly classified the wise source .",

    "the other optical - ir sources nearby to the wise position are sdssj172535.03 + 585140.0 ( @xmath16 ) and sstxflsj172535.0 + 585139 ( @xmath16 ) . @xcite and @xcite , report that these source are counterparts of 2massj17253500 + 5851400 , but while the former authors indicate for this source a photometric redshift estimate of @xmath61 with a 53.3% probability of the source redshift lying in the range @xmath62 , the latter authors report a tentative redshift upper limit @xmath63 estimated from the 4000   break . while the latter estimate is compatible with our evidence of this source being a bzb ( redshift of bzb in bzcat range from 0.023 to 1.34 , peaking at @xmath64 ) , the former is unlikely for such a source , indicating either a doubtful association of sdssj172535.03 + 585140.0 with 2massj17253500 + 5851400 ( or of the 2mass source with wisej172535.02 + 585140.0 ) or an unreliable photometric redshift estimate .",
    "the optical spectra we obtained with mmt , loiano and oan telescopes provide the first confirmation of the association procedure and the tentative classification of gamma - ray blazar candidates developed by @xcite and adopted by @xcite , as well as those proposed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the four wise sources associated with known @xmath6-ray blazar counterparts have been tentatively classified as bzbs by @xcite . in fact , the authors assign to every source a class a , b , or c depending on the probability of the wise source to be compatible with the model of the wise _ fermi _ blazar locus ( wfb ) in the three dimensional color space : class a sources are considered the most reliable candidate blazars for the high - energy source , while class b and class c sources are less compatible with the wfb locus but are still deemed as gamma - ray blazar candidates . according to this classification , the source wisej022239.60 + 430207.8 is a class a bzb @xmath6-ray candidate , while the other sources here analyzed are class b bzbs .",
    "the spectra presented in figure [ fig : spectra2 ] confirm for all these sources their bzb nature .",
    "in addition , for the source wisej100800.81 + 062121.2 ( associated with the blazar bzbj1008 + 0621 ) we provide for the first time a tentative redshift estimate @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , optical spectroscopy can be used to test the predictions of the different association procedure that are used to find @xmath6-ray blazar candidates lying in the uncertainty regions at 95% level of confidence of ugss or agus listed in the 2fgl or 2lac . in particular the sources",
    "wisej050558.78 + 611335.9 and wisej064459.38 + 603131.7 are selected by @xcite as class c @xmath6-ray blazar candidates of bzb and undefined type , respectively ; wisej060102.86 + 383829.2 is selected as @xmath6-ray blazar candidate by @xcite on the basis of its low - frequency radio properties ; wisej022051.24 + 250927.6 is selected as @xmath6-ray blazar candidate by @xcite combining its _ swift _ x - ray emission and its ir wise colors ; finally , wisej104939.34 + 154837.8 is selected as @xmath6-ray blazar candidate by @xcite combining its radio emission and its ir wise colors . as shown in figure [ fig : spectra1 ] all these wise sources show a blazar - like optical spectrum .",
    "in particular , wisej050558.78 + 611335.9 and wisej060102.86 + 383829.2 show featureless bzb spectra , while wisej104939.34 + 154837.8 shows an almost featureless spectrum with weak absorption lines consistent with ca ii h & k yielding a redshift estimate @xmath65 ; the ew of these line - @xmath66   - is however consistent with the bzb definition given in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "on the other hand , wisej022051.24 + 250927.6 and wisej064459.38 + 603131.7 show bzq type spectra with emission lines with @xmath67   and @xmath68  , yielding redshift values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of wisej064459.38 + 603131.7 , in particular , is somewhat reminiscent of weak emission line quasar spectra @xcite , but the blazar identification for this source appears problematic .",
    "in fact the wisej064459.38 + 603131.7 is not detected by nvss survey , so we can only put an upper limit on its flux @xmath37 mjy .",
    "even if it is possible that deeper radio observations will detect emission from the source , blazars are traditionally defined as radio - loud sources basing on present radio data .",
    "all confirmed blazar from bzcat are in fact detected at 1.4 ghz with fluxes @xmath69 mjy , and radio - quiet blazars are extremely rare objects @xcite . given the observed optical and x - ray flux and assuming @xmath4 we can evaluate the effective spectral indices defined between the rest - frame frequencies of @xmath70 ghz , @xmath71    and @xmath72 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and put an upper limit on @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while we have @xmath75 .",
    "we note that @xmath76 of the bzbs in bzcat catalog have @xmath77 and @xmath78 smaller than the evaluated upper limits .",
    "however , these values are similar to the peak of the spectral index distributions found in the same catalog , that fall in the ranges @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    the blazar nature of our candidates is also reinforced when comparing their multi - wavelength seds with those of the known @xmath6-ray blazars , presented in figures [ seds_figure1 ] and [ seds_figure2 ] in appendix [ app : seds ] , respectively . despite the non simultaneity of the observations",
    ", we can clearly see the two main spectral components - that is , lower energy synchrotron and higher energy inverse compton - typical of blazar seds .",
    "in the same figures we overplotted the optical spectra presented in figures [ fig : spectra1 ] and [ fig : spectra2 ] .",
    "although a blazars are characterized by strong variability - and therefore a precise matching between non simultaneous data is not to be expected - we notice a general agreement between optical photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "we presented a pilot project to assess the effectiveness of several methods in selecting gamma - ray blazar candidates . to this end , we presented optical spectroscopic observations for a sample of five @xmath6-ray blazar candidates selected with different methods based on their radio to ir properties , and for a sample of four wise counterparts to known @xmath6-ray blazar .",
    "the main results of our analysis are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we confirm the blazar nature of all the sources associated with known @xmath6-ray blazars .",
    "in addition , we obtain for the first time a tentative redshift estimate @xmath5 for the blazar bzbj1008 + 0621 . 2 .",
    "we confirm the blazar nature of all the @xmath6-ray blazar candidates selected by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , we obtain for wisej104939.34 + 154837.8 , wisej022051.24 + 250927.6 and wisej064459.38 + 603131.7 redshift estimates of @xmath65 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "3 .   the source wisej064459.38 + 603131.7 , in particular , is intriguing since it shows an almost featureless continuum with weak emission lines reminiscent of weak emission line quasar spectra @xcite , but it lacks any obvious radio counterpart , which is required for a blazar classification @xcite .",
    "while these preliminary results seem to confirm the effectiveness of the classification method presented by @xcite and of the selection methods presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , additional ground - based , optical and near ir , spectroscopic follow up observations of a larger sample of @xmath6-ray blazar candidates are needed to confirm the nature of the selected sources and to obtain their redshift .",

    "<S> a significant fraction ( @xmath0% ) of the gamma - ray sources listed in the second _ fermi _ lat ( 2fgl ) catalog is still of unknown origin , being not yet associated with counterparts at lower energies . using the available information at lower energies and optical spectroscopy on the selected counterparts of these gamma - ray objects we can pinpoint their exact nature . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a pilot project pointing to assess the effectiveness of the several classification methods developed to select gamma - ray blazar candidates . to this end , we report optical spectroscopic observations of a sample of 5 gamma - ray blazar candidates selected on the basis of their infrared wise colors or of their low - frequency radio properties . </S>",
    "<S> blazars come in two main classes : bl lacs and fsrqs , showing similar optical spectra except for the stronger emission lines of the latter . for three of our sources </S>",
    "<S> the almost featureless optical spectra obtained confirm their bl lac nature , while for the source wisej022051.24 + 250927.6 we observe emission lines with equivalent width @xmath1  , identifying it as a fsrq with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the source wisej064459.38 + 603131.7 , although not featuring a clear radio counterpart , shows a blazar - like spectrum with weak emission lines with @xmath3  , yielding a redshift estimate of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we report optical spectroscopic observations of 4 wise sources associated with known gamma - ray blazars without a firm classification or redshift estimate . </S>",
    "<S> for all of these latter sources we confirm a bl lac classification , with a tentative redshift estimate for the source wisej100800.81 + 062121.2 of @xmath5 . </S>"
