    "in simulations with our resistive version of the zeus-3d code , in the axisymmetry option , we set innermost region of a star - disk system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath0  au .",
    "disk is in a slightly sub - keplerian rotation , with a rotating , hydrostatic corona and purely dipole magnetic field centered at the origin .",
    "resistivity in the disk is constant , and in corona it is modeled by density , with @xmath1 , following @xcite .",
    "all simulations of star - disk interaction in our setup go through four stages : 1 ) relaxation with pinching of magnetic field inwards , 2 ) reconnection with opening of the stellar dipole , 3 ) narrowing of the disk gap with formation of transient funnel flow onto the stellar surface , 4 ) final stage of equilibrium of magnetic and disk ram pressure , with two outflows , one axial and another conical .",
    "the final stage is shown in fig .",
    "it is similar to the result reported in @xcite , but with the difference that our simulation is in the regime with magnetic prandtl number smaller than unity .",
    "physical resistivity , together with reconnection , helps launching of outflows .",
    "in purely resistive mhd numerical simulations , we obtain solutions with two streams of matter flowing out from the innermost magnetosphere around a young stellar object .",
    "this is the first simulation in which a conical outflow is launched with magnetic prandtl number less than unity , that is , with resistivity larger than viscosity , by magnetic reconnection .",
    "the configurations of the field are modified during the reconnection to channel flowing out from the innermost region of the disks ."
