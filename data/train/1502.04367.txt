    "brought to light over three decades ago , krner and marton s @xcite technique based on statistically dependent codebooks possessing algebraic closure properties , henceforth referred to as structured codebooks , outperformed all current known techniques based on iid codebooks and challenged this widely held belief .",

    "are the following .",
    "firstly , in contrast to the rich theory based on iid codebooks , structured codes have been studied only in the context of particular additive and symmetric channels . in other words , the lack of a general theory - an achievable rate region based on structured codes for arbitrary instances of the multi - terminal channel in question - fuels doubt .",

    "the significance of our work is summarized as follows .",
    "first and foremost , through our examples , we provide a definitive reasoning to step beyond iid codebooks and adopt ensembles of codes possessing richer properties . given that achievability proofs",
    "are synonymous with iid codebooks , the import of this can not be overstated .",
