    "one anticipates that a high hydrostatic pressure significantly compresses the interlayer distance of p atoms , however , it remains a puzzle and unclear scenario : how do the electronic structures evolve with increasing hydrostatic pressures ?",

    "@xcite pointed out that a crystal with glide planes and scream axes might form a 3d dirac semimetal when the electronic structures of the crystal possess a twofold - degenerate bands , since the nonsymmorphic symmetry in the crystal lattice leads to the band inversion at a point in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the space group of bulk black phosphorus has a glide plane , thus it is a potential candidate of a 3d dirac semimetal . to elucidate electronic and optical properties of black phosphorus under hydrostatic pressure , in this letter , using the first - principles electronic structures calculations and analytic studies , we for the first time present the evolutions of the band structures and fermi surfaces of black phosphorus under hydrostatic pressure , and clearly demonstrate the @xmath13 transition from a semiconductor to a dirac semimetal .",
    "we argue that the non - symmorphic symmetry in crystal structure of black phosphorus protects it as a 3d dirac semimetal .",

    "it is desirable and self - consistent to adopt the same first - principles method with the same exchange - correlation potential to calculate the electronic properties of black phosphorus over wide pressure range .",
    "however , due to the limit of each method , we have to adopt different exchange - correlation potential to calculate the energy band of the semiconductor and semimetal .",
    "the pressure dependence of band structures for the semiconductive ( mbj results ) and for the semimetallic ( pbe result ) phases of bulk black phosphorus is shown in fig . [ fig4-bands ] .",

    "the band gap gradually closes and the two bands below and above e@xmath12 touch at the z - point .",
    "thus the critical pressure for the semiconductor - semimetal transition is about @xmath0=1.23 gpa in the mbj functional , which is comparable with the value observed in the recent experiment @xcite .",

    "this raises a question : what is the physical origin of the formation of the dirac semimetal ? considering the space - group symmetry operators of the black phosphorus , we attribute the origin of dirac points to the symmetry of the nonsymmorphical space group in black phosphorus . in the hydrostatic pressure range we studied ,",
