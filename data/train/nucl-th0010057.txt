    "from the recently fitted high quality boson exchange models their is none which fits the latest nn phase shift analyzes , which today extents to 3 gev@xcite .",
    "several theoretical attempts , which explicitly included the delta and other nucleonic resonances , remained qualitative and do not meet the required high standard of reproduction of phase shifts or on - shell t - matrices , as is needed in their use for nucleon - nucleus reaction studies .",
    "potentials are still very convenient to extent the two nucleon on - shell t - matrix into the off - shell domain which enters in few and many body reaction calculations .",
    "it is now well established that all the high quality nn potentials have a very similar off - shell continuation which is practically the same as implied by local inversion potentials in r - space .",
    "repeatedly occur claims , regarding the nn t - matrix off - shell , of sensitivity in few body reactions .",
    "practically , these claims end mostly in clear failures of precise on - shell reproductions of t - matrices .",
    "we followed such studies in pp bremstrahlung and microscopic optical model calculations at low and medium energy and found unanimous support for need of a precise on - shell reproduction with little effects from far off - shell t - matrices .",
    "this is what our approach satisfies .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1n boson exchange models and older phenomenological separable potentials describe the delta resonance rather as a molecular system , composed of a well separated @xmath1 and nucleon , and not as a compactly fused elementary particle .",
    "contrary to these findings support elastic scattering inversion potentials in the [ 3/2,3/2 ] channel the intermediate formation of a fused @xmath1n system , the delta resonance .    since , already at low energy , production and in - elasticity is important for many elementary systems we develop optical potentials for nn , @xmath1n , @xmath2 and kn scattering .",
    "the details of how these potentials are calculated with a stringent link to _ experimental phase shifts _ is contained in sect .",
    "the complex optical model potentials are then used to calculate wave functions , radial probabilities and the radial losses of flux from the continuity equation .",
    "what we expect from these studies is the support of existing mental images of formation and fusion of elementary particles .",
    "the transition into a combined object , viewed in terms of the relative distance between the centers of particles , is to be signaled by a concentration of loss of flux from the entrance channel and thus disappearance into the qcd sector and deeper down into complex particle production processes .",
    "we expect a typical distance of @xmath3 fm with the implication that the charge form factors overlap significantly , 80 - 95% .",
    "ad hoc , this picture is not supported for @xmath1n boson exchange potentials , at least in studies of the @xmath4 resonance . to illustrate these findings we show samples in sect.3 .",
    "the elastic partial wave nn phase shifts are now available from arndt _ et al .",
    "_ for energies @xmath5 gev .",
    "caught from the spirit of inverse scattering , we generate a quantitative optical model for any of these nn partial waves with a versatile program which allows studies of complex separable potentials on the background of the existing nn potentials like paris , nijmegen and our own inversions .",
    "the described procedure , sect 2 , is the inverse scattering branch of soft obstacle identification with elastic scattering data and their partial wave phase shift decomposition respectively . with the experimentally determined phase shifts and thus the on - shell t - matrix , an inversion algorithm is a mean to continue these on - shell values into the off - shell domain within classes of potentials .",
    "the class is limited in the present calculations to be a range of well established , real valued in r - space , obep ( paris , nijmegen - ii , nijmegen - i , reid-93 , av18 , esc-96 ) or inversion reference potentials and separable potentials with complex strengths .",
    "the separable potential strengths are determined with an inversion algorithm which guarantees full agreement with any experimental phase shift in any partial wave and energy .",
    "a versatile range of options for the separable potential form factors permit also studies of boundary condition models which suit distinctions between hadronic and qcd domains .",
    "nn scattering is formally described by the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath6 it serves as ansatz for the blankenbecler - sugar reduction which is obtained from the integral equation ( [ besal ] ) in terms of four - momenta @xmath7 using the propagator @xmath8^{(1 ) } \\left [ { \\frac12{\\not\\kern-.25em}p + { \\not\\kern-.25em}k + m \\over ( \\frac12 p + k)^2 - m^2 + i \\varepsilon}\\right]^{(2)}\\ .\\ ] ] the superscripts refer to the nucleon ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively , and in the cm system , @xmath9 , with total energy @xmath10 .",
    "the reduction of the propagator @xmath11 uses the covariant form @xmath12 where only the positive energy projector is used .",
    "finally , a three - dimensional equation is obtained from @xmath13 taking matrix elements with only positive energy spinors yields the minimum relativity form @xmath14 with the substitutions @xmath15 we obtain a lippmann - schwinger equation for the t - matrix @xmath16 the relation between t - matrix and potential , or free wave function and scattering wave function , @xmath17 gives the schrdinger wave equation @xmath18 \\psi({\\bf r } ,   k)=0\\ , \\ ] ] where the reduced mass @xmath19 must be used for consistency with reference potentials .",
    "a careful and consistent treatment of @xmath20 factors in the transformation are important for use of t - matrices in few and many body calculations where relativity is of importance .",
    "minimal relativity enters only in the calculation of @xmath21 , @xmath22 while the relative momentum in cm system is @xmath23 which , for equal masses , reduces to @xmath24 .",
    "we distinguish three hamiltonians : i. ) a reference hamiltonian @xmath25 with elastic scattering solutions @xmath26 , with real phase shifts ( equivalent to a unitary s - matrix in the elastic channel ) , of which any quantity , such as wave functions and phase shifts , is readily computed ; ii . ) a projected hamiltonian @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the q - space functions @xmath30 are doorway states describing the qcd entrance sector from finite size nucleons , mesons and possible other particles .",
    "meson creation and annihilation occur only in q - space and deeper down .",
    "full optical model hamiltonian @xmath31 , with scattering solutions @xmath32",
    ". they shall match asymptotically continuous energy fit solution of elastic channel s - matrices . in the present case ,",
    "the experimental complex phase shifts are taken from said@xcite .",
    "the reference potential @xmath33 and @xmath34 are to be specified in detail with any of the applications .      using the scattering equations , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 or as lippmann - schwinger equation , @xmath38 orthogonality @xmath39 yields @xmath40 and @xmath41 the p - space solutions , in terms of @xmath42 , are @xmath43 with a separable potential @xmath44 and @xmath45 the q - space definition gives a unique value for the separable potential @xmath46 and its strengths @xmath47 .",
    "the result looks like a first order born approximation but is exact .",
    "however , in the next step we allow the strength matrix @xmath48 to vary with the implication to reproduce asymptotically the experimental phase shifts of the full hamiltonian @xmath49 in case of non unitary s - matrices a complex optical model is the result of matching @xmath50 from @xmath51 we obtain the strengths @xmath52 . next , the separable potential is transformed into @xmath53 for which the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath54 holds .      the radial wave functions ( we identify the complete channel set of quantum numbers by @xmath55 ) of the reference potential @xmath56 are numerically integrated for single and coupled channels by numerov .",
    "the potentials @xmath57 are available for the quantum numbers ( lsjt ) for the paris , nijmegen , argonne and our own inversion r - space potentials paris , nij1 , esc96 all @xmath58 , and nij2 , reid93 , av18 , hhinv all @xmath59 .",
    "the physical solutions are matched asymptotically to riccati hankel functions @xmath60 and normalized @xmath61 the outgoing wave jost solution @xmath62 is calculated by the same token as the physical solution and they are used in the reference potential green s function @xmath63 -\\left(2\\mu\\over \\hbar^2",

    "any rank is admitted but this requires to determine the strengths @xmath65 from data at several energies around the mean energy @xmath71 .",
    "the rank @xmath72 option can be succesfull for single channel cases but suffers from lack of energy dependence in data for coupled channels . as we may use any radial form factor we found rank one separable potentials in any case the better option and they are : a. ) harmonic oscillator radial wave functions @xmath73 ; b. ) normalized gaussians",
    "@xmath74 with @xmath75 fm , @xmath76 fm , with the option to put the reference potential equal to any value for @xmath77 , simulates a smooth boundary condition around @xmath78 ; c. ) a step function @xmath79 and zero else , is very suitable to determine the boundary conditions at a chosen radius @xmath78 .",
    "it serves as surface for the transition from the hadronic into the qcd domains .",
    "it is the usual boundary condition model .",
    "obviously , these examples of form factors are may be replaced by microscopic qcd inspired models with a wide range of theoretical inspirations@xcite .",
    "the probability density of the full @xmath80 problem @xmath81 and the loss of flux , from the continuity equation @xmath82 @xmath83 are interesting to display .",
    "we concentrate in this contribution upon mesonic channels and refer for the nn results to the contribution by andreas funk . in fig .",
    "1 we show a sample of the latest said @xmath1n continuous phase shift solutions ( crosses are single energy solutions ) and the optical model potentials reproduce exactly the continuous soltions ( full lines)@xcite . the rapid changes with energy are signaling resonances which have its correspondences in a strong build - up and concentration of probability at short distances @xmath84 fm .",
    "similar to the probabibilties behaves the loss of flux which is concentrated in the same radial region , left and right columns .",
    "best fusion examples are seen in the @xmath85 , a highly inelastic resonance is@xmath86 , and no fusion is seen in @xmath87 .",
    "some resonances feed strongly into other channels , shown with the loss of flux which is highly concenrtrated at the same energy , whereas others are predominant elastic channel resonances , see@xmath88 .",
    "similar results are observed in other channel and in @xmath2 and kn systems @xcite .",
    "we conclude from our calculations that a significant part of resonances , listed in the data tables , do not fall into the category of fused systems but rather show a strong energy dependence with complex structures in probilities and absorption , there appearances are more like molecules .",
    "complex and fused structures , like dibaryon resonaces , @xmath2 see fig .",
