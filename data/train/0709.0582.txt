    "deformations ( elastic or otherwise ) under applied external stress is a well  studied subject @xcite .",
    "it is known that the kinematics of such deformations can be understood by analysing the behaviour of the kinematical quantities , namely the _",
    "isotropic expansion _",
    ", the _ shear _ and the _ rotation or vorticity_. however , as far as we know , most of these investigations do not explicitly address the question of evolution of the expansion , rotation or shear in _ time _ by solving the associated initial value problem for the system of differential equations involving these variables .",
    "we believe that such a study could shed light on the role of initial conditions ( more precisely , the initial values of the expansion , rotation and shear at some time ) in the kinematics of deformations . additionally , many subtleties ( integrals of motion , critical values , appearance of singularities etc . ) in the nature of the evolution of these quantities may emerge if one is able to obtain exact solutions or even scan the full domain of numerical solutions of the relevant coupled , nonlinear system of evolution equations involving expansion , shear and rotation .    the equations we will discuss in this article are , essentially ,",
    "the raychaudhuri equations @xcite , so prominent and well - known in the study of spacetime singularities in gravitation and cosmology @xcite-@xcite . in the context of gravitation , the central result that emerges from the raychaudhuri equations , is the notion of geodesic focusing .",
    "the analysis which is based on an inequality ( in the first order approach ) or the theory of second order ordinary differential equations ( in the second order approach ) proves the seemingly simple statement : _ if gravity is attractive then geodesics must focus to a singularity in the congruence ( which , may or may not be a genuine spacetime singularity)_. in the broader context of riemannian geometry , focusing in a geodesic flow arises provided one obeys the appropriate convergence condition .    in this article , we , however , will restrict ourselves to a background flat space ( not spacetime ) and first deal with two spatial dimensions , and then with three dimensions .",
    "the family of worldlines ( the so - called geodesic congruence ) will be replaced , in our case ( i.e. for deformable media ) , by the deformation vectors , with the time derivative of the deformation vector replacing the _ tangent vector _ to the _ geodesic flow_. the _ geodesic equation _ used to generate the geodesic flow , which is normally used as an input in deriving the raychaudhuri equations ( one can also write equations for non  geodesic flows too , but we do not consider them here ) will now be replaced by a second order ( in time ) equation for the deformation vector . in other words , we shall exactly follow the scheme of derivation of the raychaudhuri equations in the context of general relativity , keeping in mind the abovementioned parallels and restrictions .",
    "we mention here that by virtue of being a geometric statement , the raychaudhuri equations are applicable to a myriad of diverse situations ranging from deformations in media , fluid flow , geodesic congruences etc .",
    "our aim , as mentioned before , is to analyse , in all possible detail , the kinematics of deformations of a medium without and with stiffness and viscosity .",
    "in particular , one of the features we investigate is : how does the appearance of a singularity depend on the initial conditions on the expansion , shear or rotation .",
    "the paper is broadly divided into two parts . in section",
    "ii we talk about two dimensional media , while in section iii we focus attention on three dimensional media . in each part",
    ", we write down the relevant equations involving the expansion , rotation and shear and find analytic solutions for these variables .",
    "subsequently , we try to understand the solutions obtained by looking for generic features and their dependence on initial conditions .",
    "consider , following @xcite , a two dimensional deformable medium .",
    "an explicit example could be a thin sheet of rubber or plasticine or any putty  like modeling material .",
    "imagine that , at @xmath0 , an initial ` velocity ' field ( time rate of change of deformation ) is specified for the medium .",
    "this will correspond to an expansion , a shear and a rotation ( esr ) of the medium .",
    "alternatively , one may specify ( in place of initial velocity field ) initial conditions on the esr themselves .",
    "it may be recalled that the study of the evolution of the esr variables of a medium is important in many areas ( such as general relativity ) . to proceed further",
    ", one needs to derive the evolution equations of the deformation in terms of the esr variables .",
    "this is discussed below .",
    "let us denote the deformation of the medium in terms of the deformation vector @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 ) , which represents the vector joining any two infinitesimally separated points of the medium .",
    "the time rate of change of @xmath1 may be expressed , for small time intervals , as ( see appendix a ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary second rank tensor characterising the time evolution of the deformation vector . differentiating ( [ devveq ] ) with respect to time and using ( [ devveq ] ) to eliminate @xmath5 , we obtain @xmath6 before we write down the evolution equations for the esr , let us first define mathematically the quantities of interest .",
    "the arbitrary second rank tensor @xmath7 can be decomposed into its trace , symmetric traceless and antisymmetric parts which will correspond to the isotropic expansion ( trace scalar ) , shear ( symmetric traceless tensor ) and rotation ( antisymmetric tensor ) .",
    "this decomposition is given as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent , respectively , the expansion , shear and rotation .",
    "we can explicitly write ( [ bij ] ) in terms of the following @xmath12 matrices : @xmath13 where we have denoted the shear components as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the only rotation component as @xmath16 .",
    "thus , these four quantities @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 characterise any deformation of the two dimensional deformable medium as a function of time",
    ". one can find useful discussions on the geometrical interpretation of each of these quantities in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we now use the inputs from the previous subsection to rewrite the evolution equation for @xmath17 as four coupled , nonlinear , first order equations involving the dependent variables @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . before that , of course , we need to write down a general expression for @xmath18 .",
    "this , we assume to be ( in the linear approximation ) of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the stiffness and viscous damping in the medium , respectively , with @xmath20 of the form @xmath22 using ( [ sdform ] ) in ( [ ddotxi ] ) leads to @xmath23 finally , using the definition ( [ bij ] ) in ( [ dotb ] ) , one obtains the differential evolution ( in time ) of the esr as given by the equations : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 the equation for @xmath9 is known as a ricatti differential equation in the mathematics literature .",
    "it is nonlinear , first order and its solutions are known .",
    "note that the equations for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are structurally similar .",
    "we now look for analytical solutions of these equations and try to identify generic features which appear in the solutions .      to find solutions , it is useful to look at specific cases before we attempt the most general situation . to this end",
    ", we consider the following cases :    1 .",

    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 , 3 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "the equations ( [ theta])-([omega ] ) for each of the above cases can be obtained easily , and analytical solutions can then be derived .",
    "we now discuss below each case in detail . + * case 1 : * @xmath33 and @xmath34 + we first consider the following pair of equations , @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "it is clear from the equation for @xmath38 that its general solution would be of the form @xmath39 .",
    "this means that if @xmath40 at @xmath0 , it would remain zero forever .",
    "further , @xmath38 can not change sign during its evolution .",
    "the scheme for solving equations ( [ thetai ] ) and ( [ i ] ) would be to replace @xmath9 in ( [ thetai ] ) by @xmath41 , then solve it for @xmath38 and use it to find @xmath9 from ( [ i ] ) .",
    "once @xmath9 is known , the equations for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be solved easily .",

    "this minimum value of initial rotation is that which makes @xmath72 .",

    "it may be easily checked that all solutions with @xmath168 have finite time singularity .    in the general three dimensional case , due to a large number of variables",
    ", it may not be always possible to obtain analytical solutions of the kinematical quantities .",
    "however , one can obtain the numerical solutions for such cases .",
    "in this article , our primary purpose has been to find exact , analytical solutions of the expansion , rotation and shear by solving the system of equations involving these variables .",
    "we have also shown , in the cases of two and three dimensional media , how our solutions differ when the initial conditions on the variables change .    a crucial result in both two and three dimensions , which , we believe , is a generic characteristic of the system of equations is the existence of a critical value for the initial condition on the rotation . above and below this critical value we have observed the presence and absence of a finite time singularity in the solutions .",
    "however , it is also observed that in three dimensions a change in the initial rotation alone does not necessarily avoid a singularity .",
    "additional necessary conditions are also required to hold good in order to avoid a singularity .",
    "characteristic effects related to the presence of damping and elastic forces are also evident in the behaviour of the esr .",
    "for instance , in the presence of damping alone the area of a typical element is found to shrink in time whereas for a purely elastic medium ( without damping ) the area is conserved over a period for oscillatory solution . to help",
    "the reader appreciate our results we have given a visual representation of our results by looking at the deformations of a two dimensional square element in time with typical initial conditions above and below the critical initial rotation .    a notable fact about our analysis in two dimensions",
    "is the identification of specific regions in the space of initial conditions which give rise to either singular or nonsingular solutions of the esr .",
    "we have not been able to do so in three dimensions because of a larger number of variables involved and also due to the absence of a unique variable ` i ' ( as in two dimensions ) .",
    "it will definitely be more illuminating if we could devise a way of understanding the initial condition space in three dimensions in a manner similar to the two dimensional case .",
    "even though we have been able to solve the case of deformations in two dimensional media exactly , the more interesting and realistic case of three dimensional media in its full glory ( i.e with all the nine variables ) remains an unsolved problem .",
    "it is surely a daunting task analytically , considering the number of variables and the coupled and nonlinear nature of the equations .",
    "however , we hope to be able to extract some useful information by numerically solving these equations and making use of the analytical solutions described here as checks on our numerics .",
    "a generalisation of the system of equations derived and solved in this article concerns the situation where the evolution of the deformation is not necessarily described by a linear equation .",
    "in other words , the equation for @xmath169 may , in general , contain nonlinear terms of the form @xmath170 ( quadratic ) , @xmath171 ( cubic ) etc .",
    "such terms would however lead to the presence of @xmath172 in the equations for the esr variables . a probable way to solve such",
    "a scenario is to include the equation for @xmath172 in the system of equations and solve for the whole set either numerically or analytically .",
    "it is likely that an analytical evaluation will not be possible unless we consider a largely simplified model .",
    "we have mentioned in the introduction that such equations could describe a variety of mathematically similar situations .",
    "the next obvious step in our study of such evolution equations for flows , is , inevitably , the investigation of fluid flows in two and three dimensions .",
    "attempts towards analysing fluid flows are on and will be described in future articles",
    ".    it may be apparent to the reader that the sequence of investigations being carried out ( i.e. for deformable media , fluid flow etc . )",
    "seem to provide an indication towards the analysis of the full set of raychaudhuri equations in a curved spacetime geometry for geodesic and non  geodesic flows .",
    "that is a truly formidable task , which , as of now , is not even a well  defined problem . as a preamble to such an exercise , it may be worthwhile to look at a curved space generalisation of the deformation of two and three dimensional media and then fluid flows .    finally , of course",
    ", we would like to see that our understanding of the kinematics of deformable media as described in this article actually does correspond to deformations in the real world .",
    "our attempts at visualisation through simulations might actually be realisable in simplistic experiments .",
    "note that one of the central results we have obtained concerns the critical value of the initial condition on the rotation , on either side of which we have nonsingular and singular solutions .",
    "this is also a feature which was noted in a cosmological context , i.e. , rotation can prevent singularity formation in cosmology , though , spinning models ( like the godel universe ) had other problems and , moreover , they did not correspond to a realistic cosmology",
    ". it would be instructive , if , in some way , we could show , even in a toy experiment , the correlation between rotation and singularity formation .",
