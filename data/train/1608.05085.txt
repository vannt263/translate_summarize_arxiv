    "ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) represent the extreme low - mass regime of galaxy formation .",
    "their high inferred dynamical masses of @xmath410@xmath5  to 10@xmath6 , combined with their low luminosities ( @xmath7mag ) suggest that these objects are the most dark matter ( dm ) dominated systems in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this makes them ideal targets for indirect dm searches , and extremely valuable for our understanding of structure formation in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    from their large half - light radii and their relatively low dynamical masses",
    "it can be inferred that the two - body relaxation times of most ufds are several to hundreds of hubble times . as such , their completely un - evolved dynamical states and their extremely low metallicities @xcite make them ideal laboratories for studying star formation in low density and low metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "however , deep imaging of some of these objects revealed that they may not be in dynamical equilibrium ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and instead may have experienced strong tidal interactions with their massive hosts , making our inferences of both their masses and stellar mass functions misleading ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we are going to investigate the most elongated and most obviously disrupting ufd : hercules ( herc ) .",
    "discovered by @xcite in sdss data , herc is a prime example of an object with an unclear dynamical state : deeper and wider observations reveal more and more signs of tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite detected tidal features of herc out to more than one degree distance from its center , corresponding to more than 2kpc at the heliocentric distance of herc .",
    "these tidal features indicate that herc may be significantly less massive than inferred from kinematics under the assumption of virial equilibrium .",
    "the measured mass - to - light ratio may therefore be inflated , and herc may in fact have no dark matter component .",
    "the question is then : is herc a galaxy at all , and if so , how can we tell ?",
    "@xcite analyzed deep hst imaging of herc and other ufds .",
    "they found that herc s stellar populations resembles the old and metal - poor stars of the milky way globular cluster m92 .",
    "however , while having an overall low metallicity comparable to m92 , the observed spread in metallicities is higher than for most globular clusters ( gcs ) , and only comparable to the very massive ( and disputed ) gcs omega centauri and m54 @xcite . based on these observations , herc should be classified as a dwarf galaxy and not as a gc .",
    "dwarf galaxy or gc , both are subject to tidal forces and can be disrupted through energetic tidal shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "especially satellites falling into the gravitational potential of their hosts on nearly radial orbits will experience periodic , explosive mass loss on short timescales , but may yet be long - lived objects due to the orbital period being of the order of @xmath8gyr .",
    "herc may be undergoing such explosive disruption .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested several times that herc may be a disrupting or even completely unbound structure @xcite as it shows striking similarity to numerical models of disrupting satellites @xcite .",
    "most of these arguments were based on herc s elongated and irregular shape @xcite .",
    "@xcite found velocity substructure with a dispersion of about 1kms@xmath3 and a small offset of about 2kms@xmath3 from the assumed systemic velocity of herc and suggested it could be due to disruption .",
    "however , such a velocity substructure was not a natural prediction of these dissolution scenarios .",
    "moreover , scenarios in which herc is interpreted as a tidal stream in formation predict a strong distance gradient across the body of herc , for which there is no indication in the photometric data .    here",
    ", we are going to demonstrate how the observational data can be explained within a scenario in which herc is on a very radial orbit of eccentricity @xmath9 . the elongated part of herc that was found in sdss and lbt data can then be interpreted as an _ exploded component _ that has been blasted off of the herc progenitor during the last pericenter passage .",
    "this component is being deflected asymmetrically by the gravitational potential of the milky way due to differential orbital precession .",
    "the particular geometry of this debris structure may yield powerful constraints on the shape of the galactic gravitational potential .",

    "[ sec : streakline ] we derive an orbit for herc using streakline modeling and bayesian inference . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] we study the behavior of satellites on such an extreme orbit by means of @xmath0-body simulations .",

    "[ sec : differential ] .",
    "other signatures resulting from this scenario are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : signatures ] .",
    "we conclude that hercules is most probably a nearly - dissolved dwarf galaxy , which we see right now approaching its apocenter , and motivate future observations ( sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "the milky way satellite hercules was first discovered by @xcite in data from the sloan digital sky survey . its location on the sky is ( ra , dec@xmath10 deg , and ( l , b@xmath11deg in galactic coordinates . since its discovery , several follow - up observations and modeling attempts have tried to explain herc s nature and current dynamical state .",
    "various distance measurements put herc far beyond the galactic bulge into the very outskirts of the milky way halo .",

    "the weighted mean of these estimates is 140kpc , which makes herc one of the outermost ( of the known ) satellites of the mw .",
    "herc s total mass is largely unknown , which is due to the fact that its dynamical state is unclear . using deep , wide - field lbt data",
    ", @xcite showed that herc s surface density profile is very elongated , having an axis ratio of 3:1 .",
    "its ellipticity appears to vary from the innermost core having @xmath16 to the outermost parts of the satellite at about 10arcmin radius with @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite already argued that this could be a sign of ongoing tidal disruption , but point out that herc would have to be on a very eccentric orbit for that . with additional lbt imaging",
    ", @xcite found a similar ellipticity of @xmath18 , and measured a half - light radius of about 230pc .",
    "moreover , they found over - densities of herc - like stars up to about 1.3kpc from its center .",
    "these tidal feature are also traced by blue horizontal branch stars @xcite . the full extent of herc s disruption has recently been demonstrated by @xcite : the authors used ctio / decam imaging data to reveal tidal debris of herc out to a radius of more than 2kpc along the major axis of the satellite , and also perpendicular to this elongation ( tab .  [ tab : overdensities ] ) .",
    "they find that there are at least as many herc - like stars within its debris than in its main body , suggesting that herc is losing mass at a high rate .",
    "@xcite estimate the absolute integrated magnitude of herc s main body to be @xmath19mag , corresponding to a stellar mass of @xmath20 .",
    "dynamical mass estimates , however , yield masses @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite , for example , use keck / deimos spectroscopy of essentially all targets within herc that are bright enough to be observed from 10m - class telescopes to identify 30 likely herc member stars . from these",
    "they measure a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath22kms@xmath3 . assuming spherical symmetry , virial equilibrium , orbital isotropy , and making the assumption that herc s mass follows its light distribution , the authors estimate a total mass of @xmath23 and a dynamical mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath24 ) of @xmath25 .",
    "contamination from foreground and background stars is a concern for the faint and distant satellite .",
    "@xcite use int / wfc strmgen photometry to clean their spectroscopic sample .",
    "their final data set contains 18 red giant branch stars with radial velocity measurements ( tab .",
    "[ tab : radialvelocities ] ) .",
    "those have a velocity dispersion of @xmath26kms@xmath3 , resulting in a dynamical mass of @xmath27 within a radius of 433pc , also assuming virial equilibrium , isotropy and spherical symmetry .",
    "their estimated @xmath24 is with @xmath28 lower than the result of @xcite , but still way beyond any @xmath24 of a simple stellar population .",
    "therefore , hercules has to be either strongly dark - matter dominated , or brought out of virial equilibrium through tidal shocks .",
    "the latter scenario is supported by the fact that despite its strong elongation , @xcite find no sign of significant internal rotation in hercules .",
    "@xcite do find a tentative radial velocity gradient , which may indicate some degree of rotation , but the gradient does not appear strong enough to suggest that herc is a fully rotationally supported system .",
    "moreover , its systemic velocity of @xmath29kms@xmath3 suggests that hercules may be on a significantly radial orbit within the milky way @xcite : assuming that the sun is in a right - handed , galactocentric cartesian coordinate system at @xmath30kpc with a peculiar velocity of @xmath31kms@xmath3 @xcite , herc s heliocentric radial velocity tells us that it is speeding away from the milky way with at least @xmath32kms@xmath3 .",
    "of course , this could either mean that herc is on a very radial orbit or not bound to the mw at all .",

    "the sequence shows the transition from the `` bound '' ( 1 , 2 ) to the `` tidal '' ( 3 , 4 ) almost into the `` stream '' ( 5 , 6 ) regime as described by @xcite .",
    "the more the satellites suffered from the last tidal shock , the larger are their effective radii and the more elliptic and irregular they are .    despite the recent tidal shocking",
    ", model1 appears as a compact , circular satellite .",
    "model2 is a bit more extended but also round and symmetric .",
    "model3 , which has lost 2/3 of its initial mass , shows signs of an elongated component outside its `` half - light '' radius of about 50100pc , although its half - light contour is still fairly round .",
    "its elongation is most pronounced within its instantaneous jacobi radius , which measures 279pc or 0.1deg at this time . comparing this panel of model3 with the evolution of the mass shells in fig .",
    "[ kr ] shows that the elongated component is formed by debris that has been affected by the last tidal shock and is now expanding rapidly .",
    "model4 shows a significantly stronger elongation along the orbit with an ellipticity of 0.4 .",
    "the entire satellite is in the process of expanding at the final snapshot .",
    "model 5 and 6 show increasingly larger present - day half - light radii , with model6 being comparable to the real herc s extent of 0.13deg , corresponding to 330pc . unlike model4",
    ", these two models have a strongly elongated debris component perpendicular to the orbit .",
    "model5 appears to be simultaneously expanding along and perpendicular to the orbit , whereas model6 is expanding primarily perpendicular to its orbit , matching the extent and orientation of the observed herc debris very well ( see also fig .  [ halflight ] ) .    in order to measure the effective radii of the models and determine their ellipticity , we smooth the data with a gaussian kernel using the scipy / stats package @xcite , where we fix the bandwidth to 1arcmin for better comparison among the models .",
    "we then fit an ellipse to the half - light contour using a python script that follows the algorithm outlined in @xcite .",
    "this method yields good fits even for models5 and 6 , which have irregularly shaped half - light contours ( fig .",

    "but the models with higher susceptibility for tidal shocking expand significantly . compared to their initial effective radii the semi - major axes of the final effective contour ellipses are up to 4 times larger .",
    "all models show somewhat elliptic half - light contours , a consequence of the recent tidal shocking .",
    "models1 and 2 are close to spherical .",
    "models3 and 4 have a significant elongation along the orbit , and model6 has a strong elongation of 0.5 perpendicular to its orbit .",
    "half - light ellipticity , for comparison , is about 0.65 @xcite .",
    "model5 is a transition case between 4 and 6 .",
    "it is capturing the moment when the orientation of the debris `` flips '' , as described by @xcite .",
    "we also fit two parametric models to the data , a two - dimensional srsic model and a two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "we use the astropy / modeling package for this task @xcite . due to their different profile slopes ,",
    "the two parametrizations capture different aspects of the six models .",
    "both tend to be more extended than the non - parametric half - light measurement , which is due to a bad fit to the data in the center of the satellite .",
    "but the trends in effective radius and ellipticity are basically the same for all three methods .",
    "figure  [ halflight ] shows that model6 captures some important aspects of the real hercules .",
    "it is strongly elongated with almost the same orientation as hercules ( cf .",

    "model6 is vastly extended , and has a low total ( stellar ) mass .",
    "the positions of the over - dense regions observed by @xcite are shown as yellow circles .",
    "the questions we will answer next are : where exactly does its elongation come from and why is it perpendicular to the orbit ? as we will see in the following section , the large extent , the low mass , and the orientation of the elliptical mass distribution perpendicular to the orbit are all a consequence of differential orbital precession .",
    ", but with time the orientation angles change as the whole satellite precesses due to tidal torques from the galactic potential ( the red line shows the median or the orientation angles ) .",
    "differential orbital precession causes the test particles to spread in orbital plane orientation ( indicated by the boxes and whiskers ) , which is most effective during pericenter passages at 1.2gyr and 3.5gyr , when the satellite orbits through the inner 5kpc of the galaxy.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    , of particles from four different streakline models after 4gyr of integration .",

    "75% of particles have inclinations of up to 0.7deg with respect to the center of the satellite , corresponding to 1.7kpc at the distance of hercules .",
    "the lower horizontal bar marks the effective radius of hercules ( 0.12deg ) , and the upper bar indicates the mean distance ( and dispersion ) of the overdensities from the center of hercules ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : overdensities ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    @xcite observe a flip in the orientation of the debris for simulations of plummer spheres with @xmath35 and half - mass radii of 100pc over 5gyr , which is similar to our configurations .",
    "however , their orbit was chosen such that it aligns with the elongation of the observed hercules @xcite .",
    "therefore , the flip misaligns the elongation with the observations . in our case , however , we chose the orbit such that the flipped debris would reproduce the observed debris overdensities around hercules @xcite . how did our streakline models know",
    "the debris would flip eventually ?",
    "the flipping is in fact a fanning @xcite : when we look at the orbital poles ( the direction of the angular momentum ) of the satellite and each of its debris stars we can see that they spread significantly throughout the simulation .",
    "figure  [ precession ] shows a number of box - and - whisker plots for an idealized streakline model at different timesteps during the past 4gyr .",
    "the satellite s initial angular momentum vector defines the reference orbital pole , @xmath36 , measured with respect to galactic north .",
    "after two orbits the difference between orbital plane orientations among the debris stars and the satellite has grown to several degrees .    in an idealized galaxy ( spherical ) , an idealized satellite ( producing zero - temperature ejecta ) would not show such a fanned debris distribution .",
    "two factors , non - zero velocities of stream stars perpendicular to the orbital plane , and a non - spherical galactic potential , can cause this fanning :    1 .",
    "the satellite ejects stars ( or stars are stripped from the satellite ) on orbits with slight intrinsic differences in the orbital planes to the satellite s orbital plane .",
    "that is , escaping stars can have offset velocities perpendicular to the orbital plane of the satellite .",
    "this effect is enhanced by severe tidal shocks as the amount of random motion is higher for such violently stripped stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   the non - spherical components of the galactic potential can exert a torque on the orbital plane of the satellite and its debris . depending on the torque angle and its leverage ,",
    "the degree of precession can vary significantly across the extent of the debris ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we show the first effect for our hercules orbit in fig .",
    "[ precession_comparison ] , which we measured by using a galactic model with a spherical dark matter halo , and no disk component . due to",
    "spherical symmetry , there is no precession in this potential so that satellite and debris stars keep orbiting in the same plane ( case _ spherical idealized _ ) .    in the same spherical potential we also created a streakline model with significant random scatter in the offset positions and velocities around the lagrange points ( case _ spherical _ ) .",
    "the velocity offsets were generated using a gaussian distribution with a width of 2 kms@xmath3 in each velocity component . for a satellite on a hercules - like orbit",
    ", the effect can produce difference angles in orbital poles of about one degree .",
    "we estimate the strength of the second effect by setting up perfectly cold streams in our oblate galaxy potential , meaning that the streakline particles are released in the instantaneous orbital plane of the progenitor and have the same angular velocity as the satellite but no velocity perpendicular to the orbital plane ( case _ oblate idealized _ in fig .",
    "[ precession_comparison ] ) .",
    "both effects are of the same order of magnitude . depending on the type of satellite and orbit one or",
    "the other effect may be more important .",
    "in fact , differential orbital precession may be a viable explanation for the stream fanning observed by @xcite for the palomar5 stream in their triaxial trial potential .",
    "satellites on hercules - like orbits will experience a combination of both effects , resulting in a spread in orbital pole orientations that is nearly twice as large as each individual effect ( _ oblate _ ) . in this case , the median orbital plane difference angle is 0.25deg , and about 75% of all streakline particles have inclinations of up to 0.7deg with respect to the center of the satellite after just two orbits around the galactic center .",
    "this difference in orbital planes corresponds to a fanning of 1.7kpc at the heliocentric distance of hercules of 140kpc .",
    "since the difference angle can be positive and negative , the spread in orbital planes gives the satellite and its debris an extent of more than 3kpc perpendicular to its orbit .",
    "although our choices for the number of particles in our streakline models was rather arbitrary , we show how this spread compares to the observed effective radius of hercules and the tidal features detected by @xcite in fig .",
    "[ precession_comparison ] .",
    "the authors report that their detected overdensities contain at least as many stars as the main body of herc .",
    "only our _ oblate _ case would be able to explain such a strong spread in orbital plane orientations .",
    "as we will show in the following section , the length of the satellite and most of its debris along the orbit is less than 1kpc .",
    "the visible part of the hercules stream is therefore wider than it is long .",
    "this unexpected shape may , in fact , be used to constrain hercules nature and its orbit .",
    "-body model6 , and model6 with added gaussian random errors of mean size 3kms@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0-body model shows a strong peak at the systemic velocity of the progenitor , corresponding to the _ exploded component_. uncertainties like the ones of the @xcite sample blur our this peaked distribution since the peak width of @xmath37kms@xmath3 is smaller than the average per - star uncertainty in the adn sample.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a low - density satellite , like our simulated hercules , that got disrupted in only two revolutions about the galactic center has a quite short debris stream ( in terms of length along the orbit compared to length of one orbit ) .",
    "following @xcite , we can estimate the length of the stream for the hypothetical case that our satellite was on a circular orbit at the current galactocentric distance of hercules . assuming a mass of about 50000and a circular velocity of about @xmath38kms@xmath3 at 140kpc ,",
    "the instantaneous tidal radius of hercules would be @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the satellite s angular velocity .",
    "the mean drift velocity of stars along the orbit of herc ( with respect to the satellite ) would then be @xmath41 within our simulation time of 4gyr , the bulk of the stream would have grown to no more than about @xmath42kpc length along the orbit ( in each direction ) .",
    "but since hercules is on a highly eccentric orbit and is currently approaching apogalacticon at a velocity of @xmath43kms@xmath3 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : streakline ] ) , its debris is significantly compressed ( approximately by a factor of @xmath44 ) as the whole debris - satellite system is decelerating . hence it will be shorter than 4kpc , and will keep being compressed until it reaches apogalacticon , where the satellite s velocity is as low as 23kms@xmath3 . a difference angle in orbital poles of about @xmath45deg among debris stars",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ precession_comparison ] ) is therefore substantial for such a system , since , at the heliocentric distance of 140kpc , this difference in orbital poles corresponds to a physical ( projected ) separation of @xmath46kpc , which is of the order of the compressed stream s length along the orbit .",
    "furthermore , in our simulations , herc has lost most of its mass during the last pericenter passage 500myr ago . since then",
    ", the debris has spread no more than @xmath47pc along the orbit .",
    "as we will show in the following section , this part of the debris , the _ exploded component _",
    ", has about the same angular extent as the whole stream , which makes this part of herc wider than long .",
    "this unexpected case of an elongated satellite that is moving perpendicular to its apparent major axis has two major consequences for observations of hercules .",
    "first of all , there should be no strong distance gradient along the extent of the youngest part of the stream , which was formed during the last tidal shock , that is , along the _",
    "exploded component_. secondly , radial velocity measurements are likely to pick up on different components of the satellite - stream system and get misleading results when assuming virial equilibrium",
    ". both signatures will be described in more detail below .    in fig .",
    "[ distance ] , we show the heliocentric distances of particles from our 4gyr - long @xmath0-body simulation of hercules ( model6 ) at the final snapshot .",
    "there is a dominant component at the distance of herc that is spread out in right ascension and declination but does not follow the track of herc s orbit .",
    "this is the _ exploded component _ that originates from the tidal shock herc experienced during the last pericenter passage 500myr ago .",
    "we measure the width of this component by fitting an ellipse to the contour at which the density drops to half its central value .",
    "the half - width of this ellipse in the distance dimension is 0.42kpc .    since the _ exploded component",
    "_ dominates the stellar profile of herc , photometric distance measurements should not see any distance gradient along this part .",
    "in fact , existing deep hst photometry of hercules center @xcite could be leveraged with new , equally deep hst photometry of off - center fields along the stream to measure high - precision , differential distances between the center of herc and the _ exploded component_.    figure  [ radialvelocities ] shows the radial velocities of the same data as in fig .",
    "[ distance ] .",
    "the _ exploded component _ dominates the radial velocity profile of hercules .",
    "it has a width of only @xmath37kms@xmath3 even though the satellite is completely unbound at this stage , and this velocity is nearly constant across the whole component .",
    "in contrast to that , the subdominant stream component loosely follows the radial velocity gradient of the satellite s orbit ( white line ) , which is comparable to the tentative @xmath48kms@xmath3 gradient measured by @xcite .",
    "this should come at no surprise since we used the radial velocities from @xcite as input data for our bayesian modeling ( shown as yellow data points ) .",
    "but there is more information in the available spectroscopic data : in their sample of 30 spectroscopic measurements of likely herc members , @xcite find an overdensity of 9 stars between 41 and 43km@xmath3 .",
    "they conclude that such a velocity substructure is rather unlikely and may be indicative of ongoing tidal disruption .",
    "given our scenario of a strongly gravitationally shocked hercules , the overdensity found by @xcite may very well correspond to the _ exploded component _ of herc .",
    "the other 21 candidates would then correspond to stars in the stream component or foreground contaminations @xcite .",
    "the distribution of spectroscopic targets in the @xcite data is asymmetric around this velocity substructure .",
    "our orbit prediction would suggest that this is due to the strong distance gradient of the stream component",
    ". the spectroscopic sample would then be biased towards the trailing tail ( solid white line in figs .",
    "[ distance ] & [ radialvelocities ] ) , which lies at smaller heliocentric distances .",
    "such a velocity substructure is not visible in the @xcite data . to check if it should be detectable , we selected particles from model6 in the same sky region as the adn spectroscopic sample .",
    "a normalized histogram of the @xmath49 radial velocities in this sky region is shown in fig .",
    "[ radialvelocity_histogram ] . with perfect data",
    ", the velocity substructure should be clearly visible .",
    "the adn sample has an average per - star uncertainty of 2.97kms@xmath3 ( comparable to the average uncertainty in the @xcite data ) .",
    "if we add gaussian random errors with this average size to the model points , the distribution matches the width of the observed distribution .",
    "if we draw 18 particles from this sample and calculate the velocity dispersion of this sample , and repeat this 1000 times , we get a mean value of @xmath50kms@xmath3 with a standard deviation of 0.7kms@xmath3 , which compares very well to the @xmath51kms@xmath3 reported by @xcite . future spectroscopic data with higher precision should be able to clearly resolve this velocity substructure .    at this point",
    "it is important to remember that our @xmath0-body simulation covered only the past 4gyr .",
    "a satellite that fell into the gravitational potential of the milky way at earlier times will have a much more extended , and probably more pronounced , stream component .",
    "moreover , we have to keep in mind that we fixed the galactic gravitational potential to the one determined in @xcite .",
    "since hercules is so far away from the galactic center , the geometry of hercules is very fine - tuned .",
    "hence , a small change in the choice of the potential will have a strong influence on the exact velocity structure . gathering observational constraints on the dynamical state of hercules",
    "will therefore be extremely valuable for constraining the shape of the galactic potential .",
    "using streakline modeling and @xmath0-body simulations , we have shown that the published observational data on the milky way ultra - faint satellite hercules can be explained by a disrupting low - mass satellite on a very eccentric orbit with @xmath52 ( fig .  [ orbit ] ) .",
    "we limit our investigation to the formation of the extended , elongated main body of hercules as seen in recent sdss , lbt and decam data .",
    "we find that this part of hercules may have formed during the last pericenter passage as a consequence of strong tidal shocking .",
    "for this reason , we limit our investigation to the last 4gyr , corresponding to two full orbits about the galaxy , without investigating further the nature or origin of hercules .    in our scenario , the satellite experiences strong , episodic tidal shocks at pericenter of its orbit , `` explosively '' removing large fractions of its mass ( fig .  [ kr ] ) .",
    "on our best estimate for hercules orbit , the satellite is currently approaching apocenter at 185kpc galactocentric distance , after experiencing a disruptive tidal shock at 5kpc perigalactic radius 500myr ago . from @xmath0-body simulations we estimate that the satellite must have had a very low central density ( @xmath53pc@xmath54 ) before experiencing this last tidal shock ( fig .  [ contours ] ) , and must have had a low central density of @xmath55pc@xmath54 already 4gyr ago .",
    "it would be interesting to see if disrupting satellites with such low central densities are a natural outcome of structure formation in a @xmath56cdm universe .",
    "we conclude that the object formerly known as ultra - faint dwarf galaxy hercules is at the present day most likely a largely ( or completely ) unbound structure . given these model constraints ,",
    "we conclude that hercules is unlikely to presently contain a high dark matter concentration and may therefore not be a promising candidate for dark matter search experiments .",
    "in fact , we do not require hercules to have a dark matter component in our scenario , and only the large spread in stellar metallicities among the hercules stars is indicative of hercules having been a galaxy once .",
    "this is in tension with simulations showing that nearly disrupted dwarf galaxies with cuspy dark - matter halos are strongly dark - matter dominated @xcite .",
    "we find that the reason for hercules particular shape at its current location 140kpc from the galaxy is differential orbital precession of its stars as they were deflected in the aspherical gravitational potential of the milky way ( fig .",
    "[ precession ] ) . for our assumed galaxy potential ,",
    "the difference angle between orbital plane orientations of different parts of the stream is @xmath8deg at the present day ( fig .",
    "[ precession_comparison ] ) , which corresponds to more than 2kpc angular extent on the sky at the distance of hercules . due to this effect ,",
    "the distribution of hercules stars ( bound or unbound ) is significantly larger perpendicular to the orbit than it is along the orbit , making hercules the only known stream that is broader than it is long .",
    "our scenario makes testable predictions : the last pericenter shock should have induced significant mass loss , and hercules should therefore show a prominent feature from this shock in the form of expanding tidal debris .",
    "we predict this _ exploded component _ to extent ( at least ) out to hercules effective radius of @xmath57pc , and may likely be the origin of all debris structures found by @xcite out to 1.3deg from the center of the satellite",
    ". this component should not show any distance gradient ( fig .  [ distance ] ) or radial velocity gradient ( fig .  [ radialvelocities ] ) , but with given spectroscopic precision should be clearly distinguishable in radial - velocity space from the less pronounced stream component ( fig .",
    "[ radialvelocity_histogram ] ) .",
    "the unique geometry of the hercules tidal debris and its exceptional distance from the sun make our predictions for hercules proper motions very precise ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "these proper motions correspond to velocity components as low as @xmath60kms@xmath3 and @xmath61kms@xmath3 . together with its",
    "receding radial velocity of 45.2kms@xmath3 and put into the galactic rest - frame , hercules total velocity adds up to no more than @xmath62kms@xmath3 in our scenario , of which 99% is directed radially outwards .",
    "however , this is only the prediction for the given galactic potential that we tested here @xcite .",
    "changing the shape of the galaxy model would change this prediction .",
    "vice versa , high - precision measurements of hercules true proper motions with , e.g. , gaia will therefore be able to put strong constraints on the potential of the milky way .",
    "yet , gaia will be able to measure proper motions only for the brightest stars in hercules @xcite , which are the probable g and k giants from @xcite . at the distance of hercules",
    ", these rgb stars have v magnitudes of about 20mag , resulting in gaia measurement uncertainties of @xmath630.2masyr@xmath3 , that is , an uncertainty in the tangential velocity of about @xmath64kms@xmath3 . however",
    ", leveraging gaia data with archival hst data , or waiting for lsst and especially wfirst to come online , will enable us to put significantly stronger constraints on the proper motion of hercules .",
    "but proper motion is just one way to test this scenario .",
    "measurement of a distance gradient ( or a lack thereof ) across the body of hercules is already possible with deep hst imaging .",
    "given enough of such observational constraints , herc may , in fact , be used as one of the most powerful probes of the shape of the galactic gravitational potential .    other ufds with signs of ongoing tidal disruption may also be expanding in response to intense gravitational shocks .",
    "hence , exploding satellites may pose a new powerful family of galactic potential tracers .",
