    "the existence of resistive switching memories , also known as memristors or resistive random access memories ( reram or rram ) , was predicted from circuit theory nearly half a century ago  @xcite and functional devices have been demonstrated within the past decade  @xcite .",
    "the prototypical memristor is composed of a thin slab of tio@xmath0 sandwiched between two metal electrodes  @xcite , but memristors have been realized using a wide range of insulator materials as storage medium  @xcite . by applying bias voltages in excess of given threshold values",
    ", the resistivity of the storage medium can be changed from a low - resistivity state ( lrs ) to a high - resistivity state ( hrs ) and back , over a large number of cycles  @xcite . a revolution in information technology is only hindered by the lack of understanding of the physical principles that underlie resistive switching  @xcite .",
    "thus far , two types of mechanisms have been suggested for this resistive switching .",
    "_ electronic mechanisms _ describe the switching as electrons being trapped and un - trapped inside the insulator storage medium , such that the differently charged systems would exhibit different resistivities  @xcite . _ ion drift mechanisms _ ,",
    "on the other hand , attribute the switching to a concerted diffusion of atoms / ions that leads to a controlled and reproducible formation and breaking of conductive filaments through the insulator storage medium  @xcite .",
    "the proposed electronic mechanisms suffer from the _ voltage - time dilemma _",
    "@xcite because the average lifetimes for the asserted metastable electron - trapping states are much shorter than typical memristor operation times , and ensueingly , such a system would spontaneously _ forget _ which resistive state it is in .",
    "ion drift mechanisms offer arbitrarily long lifetimes for the different resistivity states , because the corresponding filament structures ( formed or broken ) are assumed to be stable at room temperature .",
    "this stability , however , implies that the formation and/or breaking of such filaments via a concerted motion of ions is a rather slow process ( measured in seconds or minutes  @xcite ) , i.e. , much slower than memristor switching times measured in nanoseconds or less  @xcite .",
    "even accelerated ion diffusion theories  @xcite predict switching times in the order of @xmath1  s. moreover , neither mechanism justifies typical on / off resistivity ratios ( @xmath2 for tio@xmath0  @xcite , and even much larger for other materials ) .",
    "for example , assuming the ion drift mechanism for tio@xmath0 , conductivity through observed magnli phase filaments increases only by a factor of @xmath3@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we present a new electronic mechanism for resistive switching .",
    "the lrs , hrs , and possible intermediate resistivity states ( irs ) correspond to different ` band bending ' solutions of poisson s equation , which describes the electrostatic potential and charge stored inside the insulator storage medium .",
    "this implies that by controlling the defect abundance and size of the insulator material , one can construct a resistive memory using arbitrary insulator materials sandwiched between suitable metal electrodes .",
    "the present theory of resistive switching is universal , and there is no need to invoke different types of switching mechanisms for resistive memories made from different types of materials  @xcite , or specific theories for e.g.  specific correlated materials  @xcite .",
    "the variationally calculated electrostatics , or band bending solutions presented here are general for any metal / insulator / metal structures ( not only memristors ) , and as we show , in stark contrast to the typical approximations made in previous theories of resistive switching",
    ". the present theory does not exclude the existence of the formation and breaking of conductive filaments during memristor operation  , but we propose that it has a different role in resistive switching , as was assumed previously .    this work is organized as follows .",
    "first , the electrostatic model for different resistive states is presented , followed by a model device and an electrostatic theory for resistive switching .",
    "we then discuss the influence of material parameters on the multiple resistive states , and outline the design principles how to craft memristors using arbitrary insulator materials as storage medium , followed by a discussion of the role of storage media filamentation in resistive switching .",
    "finally , we propose a new magnetic memristor device with increased storage capacity , and summarize our results in the conclusion .",
    "details of our variational calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "the key point that is missing in previous switching mechanism models  electronic or ion drift based  is that they all have assumed the electrostatic potential @xmath5 within the insulator storage medium to exhibit either typical metal - insulator _ band bendings _ , or no band bending at all  @xcite ( here @xmath6 marks the position of the conduction band minimum , see app .",
    "[ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "such band bendings follow approximate ( analytic ) solutions to the one - dimensional poisson s equation @xmath7 along @xmath8 perpendicular to the metal - insulator interface , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the relative and vacuum permittivities , respectively , and the charge density @xmath11 is approximated by a step function .",
    "this approximation for @xmath11 is justified for a semiconductor with a small concentration of ( shallow ) dopants , but not necessarily in memristors , where defect concentrations can be 10@xmath12  @xmath13 ( @xmath14  nm@xmath15 ) or even larger  @xcite .",

    "we thus solve eq .",

    "we consider a prototype memristor that contains donor defects with the activation energy @xmath27 measured from the conduction band ( cb ) .",
    "the insulator storage medium forms schottky connections with both top and bottom electrodes with schottky barriers @xmath31 or @xmath32 , and @xmath27 is assumed smaller than either of these barriers .",
    "depending on initialization , we find three different families of numerical solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : poi ] ) illustrated by the band bending diagrams shown in fig .  1  ( a)(c ) . the lrs shown in fig",
    ".  1  ( a ) is characterized by a convex @xmath5 where most of the cb is filled by electrons and most donor defects are not ionized ; because of the cb filling , this state exhibits excellent band conductivity . the other convex @xmath5 solution shown in fig .",
    "1  ( b ) is an irs , which has the fermi level ( @xmath28 ) mostly pinned by @xmath27 . here",
    "most donor defects are not ionized , but because @xmath28 is very close to @xmath27 , we can expect quite large hopping conductivity .",
    "note that if @xmath27 is very close to the cb and there is significant overlap of @xmath27 and cb at room temperature , the irs becomes engulfed by the lrs , i.e. , such irs only appear for deep defects with @xmath27 well inside the band gap . at the same time , in the case of multiple deep levels , there may be multiple irs s .",
    "finally , the hrs shown in fig .  1  ( c ) exhibits a concave @xmath5 such that all donor defects are ionized , the cb is completely empty , and there are no carrier or impurity states nearby @xmath28 .",
    "we may expect poor hopping conductivity at most , i.e. , this state is an insulator .",
    "these different conductive mechanisms are supported by recent experimental observations of band conductivity for lrs and hopping conductivity for hrs  @xcite , ensued by large on / off resistivity ratios of @xmath33 or more .      applying a bias voltage of @xmath26 to the top electrode shifts the band edges at @xmath29 by @xmath34 . thus applying a negative bias in the lrs",
    "reduces the number of electrons in the cb and ionizes more and more donor defects , as shown in fig .  1  ( d ) , until the system exhibits a transition to the hrs .",
    "the transition from irs to hrs occurs similarly .",
    "applying a positive bias to the hrs , on the other hand , when @xmath35 causes an increasing number of donor levels to be de - ionized , causing a transition to the irs , and once @xmath36 the cb becomes occupied , causing a transition to the lrs .",
    "it is important to note that while the above discussion holds for a system with mainly donor defects , the equations are symmetric with respect to charge , and , the above findings hold equally well for systems with acceptor defects and hole carriers .     and charge @xmath37 stored in prototype memristor as a function of bias voltage @xmath26 .",

    "the red , orange , and blue lines indicate the hrs , irs , and lrs , and the switching from one state to the other is indicated by arrows .",
    "our prototype memristor is composed of a 20  nm slab of rutile tio@xmath0 sandwiched between metal electrodes that form a schottky barrier of @xmath41  ev at both sides . here",
    ", rutile has a band gap of 3  ev , a relative permittivity of @xmath42 80 , effective electron masses of @xmath43 8.5 and 0.4 for heavy and light electrons , and the effective hole mass of @xmath44 0.9 ( effective masses were calculated from first principles and are well in agreement with experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "we consider two defect scenarios that mimic the oxygen deficiency of tio@xmath0 memristors : ( i ) rutile contains oxygen vacancies v@xmath38 with a concentration of 0.005  nm@xmath15 ( @xmath45  @xmath13 ) , which act as shallow double donors  @xcite ; and ( ii ) rutile contains 0.005  nm@xmath15 of v@xmath38 together with 0.0025nm@xmath15 of ti interstitals ti@xmath39 , which act as a quadruple deep donor with the donor activation energy at @xmath46  ev below cb ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ; also the magnli phase filament like structures observed in tio@xmath0 may act as donors  @xcite ) . the memristor energy @xmath23 for scenario ( i ) shown in fig .  2  ( a ) has two energy branches , and for scenario ( ii ) shown in fig .",
    "2  ( c ) has three energy branches , corresponding to the different resistivity states .",
    "these energy branches coexist over a wide range of @xmath26 , and , most importantly , coexist at @xmath47 .",
    "the upshot is that once the system is in one of the different resisitivity states , it remains in that state unless a bias in excess of the switching thresholds is applied",
    ".      figs .  2  ( b ) and ( d )",
    "show the charge @xmath37 stored in the memristor .",
    "notice that none of the states hrs , irs , or lrs is charge neutral , i.e. , @xmath48 always .",
    "the insulator storage medium of a memristor thus is spontaneously charged , such that the hrs and lrs have opposite polarities . in our example cases , for @xmath47 , @xmath49 is symmetric , but in experimental devices , the schottky barriers of the top and bottom electrodes are not necessarily equal , and the defect concentration is likely inhomogeneous .",
    "such asymmetries make the system polar , which combined with charge @xmath48 stored in the device means that it can also act as a nanobattery , as observed in recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "when the hrs or irs is switched to the lrs , there is a flow of electrons into the system , because the connection with the electrode is essentially ohmic ( see fig.1  ( e ) ) . as @xmath26 then decreases below the switching threshold ,",
    "a schottky barrier is formed again , preventing leakage of @xmath37 from storage medium to electrodes . however , as @xmath26 is further decreased , @xmath37 gradually approaches 0 , and once the system is depleted from electrons , it is reset to the hrs ; for the lrs , @xmath50 , and for the hrs , @xmath51 .",
    "the switching between hrs and irs is similar , albeit here for both states @xmath51 . as @xmath52",
    ", electrons may freely occupy the deep levels @xmath27 due to ti@xmath39 , which causes a discontinuous drop in @xmath37 magnified in the inset of fig .  2  ( d ) .",

    "3 shows the electrostatic potential @xmath5 and corresponding electric field @xmath59 ( there is no @xmath60 sign because @xmath49 denotes the electrostatic potential for negative charges ; see app .  [",
    "sec : methods ] ) for our prototype memristor in defect scenario ( ii ) at zero bias [ fig .",
    "3  ( a ) ] and different bias voltages @xmath26 immediately below switching threshold values . at zero bias for the hrs , @xmath61 at the top electrode and @xmath62 at the bottom electrode , and thus any electrons possibly excited to the cb are expelled to either electrode .",
    "this combined with the fact that all donor defects are ionized gives @xmath51 . for the lrs and irs , electric field direction has changed and @xmath62 at the top electrode and @xmath61 at the bottom electrode , i.e. , electrons excited to the cb will be trapped in the central region of the storage medium .",
    "notice that for the lrs and irs , most donor defects are not ionized , but nonetheless there are some electrons in the cb of the irs , and for the lrs the cb is mostly filled by electrons , and therefore @xmath50 . here it is important to recall that at both electrodes , there is a metallic reservoir of electrons , so any electrons stored inside the memristor ( for lrs and irs ) are taken from these reservoirs , and vice versa for the hrs .",
    "the electric fields inside the memristor storage medium are very large  up to @xmath63100  mv / m  even for zero bias voltage [ fig .  3  ( a ) ] .",
    "these internal electric fields are of the same order of magnitude as constant electric fields @xmath58 typically assumed to cause the accelerated diffusion  @xcite of vacancies or impurity atoms and the ensuing formation or breaking of conductive filaments .",
    "comparison of @xmath58 for large bias voltages around switching thresholds [ dashed lines in figs  3  ( b)(e ) ] leads to a dilemma : if an electric field of @xmath6450 mv / m would cause oxygen ions from the insulator storage medium to leave their lattice sites ( form vacancies ) and drift out of the material , or metal atoms from the electrodes to drift inside the storage medium , such a process would always take place for the convex band bendings ( lrs or irs ) close to the electrodes , where the intrinsic electric field is larger than this even at zero bias .",
    "in fact , the band bending and intrinsic electric field at these electrodes is similar to what one obtains for a schottky connection of the same materials  @xcite , so applying the theory of accelerated diffusion  @xcite to a simple metal - insulator connection would predict spontaneous ion diffusion and structural rearrangement within the space charge region .",
    "thus , in order to understand the possible ion drift mechanisms or filament formation mechanisms in memristors or other metal - insulator systems , one can not rely on such simplified approximations of constant electric fields ( @xmath65 ) ; instead , electric fields inside dielectric medium must be correctly evaluated as @xmath66 ( see above for sign convention ) .",
    "previous electronic switching theories suffer from the voltage - time dilemma  @xcite , but this is not the case for the present theory .",
    "this is easily illustrated by either @xmath37 or @xmath53 inside the memristor storage medium .",
    "we must acknowledge that , in the lrs state , there is always a finite probability @xmath67 for one electron to spontaneously tunnel out of the storage medium , which for previous electronic models would cause the system to spontaneously forget its resistivity . in the present theory , however , lrs is a stationary state , and the probability for the next electron to tunnel out @xmath68 is smaller , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "by the same token , the probability for an electron to tunnel back into the storage medium from one of the electrodes @xmath70 is larger than @xmath68 , i.e. , the metastable state with one electron removed from the lrs tends to relax back into lrs rather than to decay into hrs .",
    "the same can be concluded based on the internal electric field in the storage medium : figs 3  ( b ) and ( d ) show the electric fields for small bias voltages below switching thresholds . for lrs and irs @xmath62 at the top electrode and @xmath61 at the bottom electrode , which maintains @xmath50 , and",
    "vice versa for the hrs .",
    "after such `` read '' operations at zero bias , the intrinsic electric fields drive the system towards the stationary states shown in fig .  3  ( a ) .",
    "the charge difference between hrs and irs in our prototype , however , is smaller than 1 electron per nm@xmath71 , so the occasional tunneling of just one electron out of the system can cause the system to _ forget _ its state .",
    "thus , for a reliable memristor , the difference in @xmath37 between the different resistivity states should be as large as possible .",
    "this charge difference can be maximized by choosing storage medium materials with a large electron ( or hole ) effective mass .",

    "this sets a maximum size for the memristor , which for tio@xmath0 and zno is estimated to be some tens of nm depending on the defect concentration .",
    "the superlinear behavior of @xmath73 described above arises as follows .",
    "@xmath73 is proportional to @xmath16 multiplied by @xmath49 integrated over the length @xmath72 of the memristor .",
    "for the hrs , all defects are ionized so @xmath16 is constant , proportional to defect concentration @xmath78 . at the same time , for hrs , @xmath49 is increasingly bent upwards as @xmath72 increases , which leads to the superlinear behavior of @xmath73 .",
    "the curvature of @xmath49 is inversely proportional to the relative permittivity , and hence , @xmath73 increases much more rapidly in zno than tio@xmath0 at similar defect concentrations ( cf .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( f ) in fig .  4 ) . for small",
    "@xmath72 ( around 10 nm or smaller ) , hrs , irs , and lrs are indistinguishable , because there is no band bending .",
    "this is because the curvature of @xmath49 is proportional to defect concentration .",
    "it follows that in zno , where @xmath23 for the hrs is reasonably small only for very small defect concentrations , the irs and lrs with convex band bendings only emerge at rather large @xmath72 .",
    "the above discussion illustrates the interplay of relative permittivities and defect concentrations , and serves as a guideline to design memristors using arbitrary insulator materials as storage medium .",
    "filament formation inside the memristor storage medium has been observed in various devices  .",
    "for example , conical regions of oxygen deficient magnli phases have been observed in tio@xmath0 memristors , and chain like structures of metal impurity atoms have been observed in conductive bridging random access memory ( cbram ) devices  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that many memristor devices contain such filament like structures , but their role in resistive switching is not so obvious .",
    "while voltage controlled filament formation and manipulation has been demonstrated , the time scales for such concerted ionic motion are much slower ( seconds or minutes ) than typical resistive switching times ( nanoseconds or less ) .",
    "a recent in - situ transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) study of a memristor device shows that resistive switching is accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of a dark region in tem images ensuing the switching to lrs and to hrs , respectively , which was interpreted as the formation and erasure of conductive filaments  @xcite .",
    "however , these changes appear in the tem images _ after _ the switching , over a time period of @xmath79 seconds , which would suggest that the contrast change in tem is a consequence of the switching , rather than its cause .",
    "one of the present authors has shown that quasi-1d metal impurity chains inside a semiconductor medium behave akin to a large concentration of deep impurities the semiconductor  @xcite , rather than a metallic inclusion .",
    "these 1d chains exhibit multiple ( deep ) donor or acceptor transitions , shifted from similar transitions observed for isolated impurities .",
    "we have also shown that the tio magnli phases exhibit a semiconductor band structure with an intermediate band  @xcite , which essentially may behave like a deep donor state .",
    "thus , instead of the filaments behaving like a metallic lead connecting the electrodes , we propose that their role is electronic , i.e. , they behave as donor or acceptor type defects , i.e. , in the lrs , the conductivity is not through the electronic states of the filament , but the insulator conduction band .",
    "the above case study of a memristor based on cr - doped zno discussed above leads to an intriguing extra feature .",
    "transition metal doped insulators may exhibit carrier - mediated ferromagnetism  @xcite . for cr - doped zno ( or in@xmath0o@xmath80 )  @xcite",
    "the mechanism of magnetism is such that the ferromagnetic interaction is switched on by degenerate electron doping , i.e. , by filling the cb by carrier electrons .",
    "thus , the lrs of a memristor using cr - doped zno or in@xmath0o@xmath80 would be spontaneously magnetized .",
    "the polarity of the storage medium magnetization could be controlled by a ferromagnetic top electrode , i.e. , the storage medium is assumed to adopt the polarity of the top electrode at the instant of switching .",
    "such a magnetic memristor has four spin configurations in the lrs , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . for an asymmetric memristor",
    ", all four spin configurations are expected to have different resistivities due to spin - dependent transport ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , leading to increased storage capacity of the memristor device .",
    "the spin - dependent transport could be enhanced by having a half - metallic ferromagnet  @xcite as one of the metal contacts , such as e.g. the gdn / gan interface .",
    "we present an electronic mechanism of resistive switching for nanodevices .",
    "this mechanism is demonstrated by self - consistent calculations of the electrostatic potential @xmath5 from poisson s equation for prototype resistive memory devices , composed of an insulator slab sandwiched between metallic electrodes that form schottky barriers with the insulator .",
    "the two key ingredients for resistive switching are ( i ) the insulator must be abundant with donor or acceptor type defects and ( ii ) the insulator slab thickness has to be less than some tens or hundreds of nanometers ; the maximal thickness depends on the insulator properties and defect abundance .",
    "when both conditions are met , the system exhibits multiple band bending solutions , which may correspond to the high resistivity state , where the insulator is _ completely depleted _ of charge carriers , the low resistivity state where the insulator valence or conduction band contains a maximal amount of charge carriers , or intermediate resistivity states , where the fermi level is pinned around deep impurity levels inside the gap .",
    "right amount _ of defects can be obtained during initial electroforming , which has been demonstrated to form various kinds of defects in the insulator storage medium  @xcite .",
    "these different @xmath49 are stationary states , robust against small perturbations , and stochastic tunneling of electrons into or out of the insulator storage medium can not change the resistive state of the device ",
    "switching occurs only once the bias voltage exceeds given threshold values .",
    "due to the electronic nature of the switching , it may be possible to switch resistive states also optically , provided the device is sufficiently optically transparent .",
    "this electronic nature also explains the fast switching times .",
    "finally , we propose a magnetic memristor , which could allow simultaneous control of both @xmath49 and magnetic states of the system , and increase the storage capacity of the memristor .",
