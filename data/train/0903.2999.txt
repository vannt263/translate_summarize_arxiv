    "recent years have evidenced a great interest in understanding and modeling human behavior  @xcite .",
    "the scientific attention to this topic is motivated by clear economic and technological purposes since the possibility to monitor and mathematically describe human behavior may have important implications in resource management and service allocation .",
    "examples of empirically studied human activities range from communication patterns of e - mails  @xcite and surface mails  @xcite to web surfing  @xcite , from printing requests  @xcite to library loans  @xcite .",
    "the main result , arising from all these studies , concerns the bursty behavior of humans  @xcite : the time difference ( namely @xmath0 ) between two consecutive human actions follow a power - law distribution [ i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "the burstiness of humans therefore consists of long periods of inactivity followed by short periods of time in which humans concentrate their actions .    in this paper",
    "we take the advantage of very large datasets describing human activities in the web . differently from former studies ,",
    "our data describe activities which are not necessarily related with daily routines , as for example sending and receiving e - mails : two consecutive actions performed by the same person may differ of an amount of time of the order of days , weeks , months and even years .",
    "the nature of our datasets allows therefore the statistical study of inter - event and waiting time probability distribution functions ( pdf ) defined over a wide range of possible values , where the time gaps between two consecutive actions of the same user may be even longer than one year .",
    "interestingly , the results show a clear bursty behavior of human activity over the whole range of possible values . we provide a statistical non - parametric test",
    "able to quantify the reliability of the global inter - event and waiting time pdfs ( global in the sense that they are calculated over all users ) in order to predict the same distributions in the case of single users .",
    "for inter - event time pdfs , we find that the decay exponents strongly depend on the activity of the users  @xcite and therefore pdfs corresponding to different level of activity are more representative than a global one .",
    "this finding suggests to suppress the dependence of the inter - event time by considering relative quantities instead of absolute ones .",
    "if the variables representing the inter - event times are divided by their average values , the new variables obey , independently on the activity of single users , the same distribution and the single users pdfs are well represented by the global pdf .",
    "differently , in the case of the waiting time pdfs the decay exponents do not depend on the activity of the users and the global pdf well describes the activity patterns of single users .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] , we give a detailed description of the data used in our empirical analysis . in section  [ sec : act ] , we show that populations of users present an heterogeneous degree of activity .",
    "we then start to consider inter - event and waiting time statistics ( sections  [ sec : time ] and  [ sec : wait ] ) . in section  [ sec : time_a ] , we compute the global inter - event time pdfs and we characterize them by estimating the decay exponents . in section  [ sec :",
    "time_b ] , we statistically test the reliability of the inter - event time pdfs to describe the real activity of single users . since the activity patterns of single users are in general not well described by the global inter - event time pdf , we calculate the inter - event time pdfs for users who have performed a similar number of actions and show that these distributions ( i ) well describe the activity patterns of single users and ( ii ) are in general different each other .",
    "the previous results suggest the possibility to find a more general rule . in section",
    "[ sec : scaling ] , we suppress the dependence on the number of activities of the variables representing the inter - event times by simply dividing these quantities with their average values .",
    "the new variables generate new single users pdfs : the global pdf of rescaled inter - event times is able to significantly describe the activity patterns of single users . in section  [ sec : wait ] , we calculate the time gap between messages and their replies ( waiting times ) and the statistics associated with them . in this case , the global pdf is able to significantly describe the behavior of single users . in section  [ sec : end ] we summarize the results of the paper and formulate our final considerations .",

    "feedback messages are made public through eb website and serve as quantitative measure for the reputation of buyers and sellers .",

    "+ we collected data directly from eb website  . in order to download data with first selected four seed users and then followed the network of contacts ( users are nodes of this network and feedback messages stand for directed connections between users ) , starting from our seeds up to their third shell . in this way , we downloaded @xmath11 feedback messages sent by @xmath12 users .",

    "in fig.s  [ fig1 ] we plot the probability @xmath19 , calculated as the relative ( with respect to the whole population ) number of users who have performed @xmath20 total operations . for all databases analyzed in this paper ,",
    "we see that @xmath19 is broad and its tail decays power - like as the @xmath20 increases [ i.e. , @xmath21 , for @xmath22 . the decay exponents are : @xmath23 for aol , @xmath24 for eb and @xmath25 for wp . in the case of aol the value of the exponent suggests a decay which is more exponential than power - like ( see fig .",

    "we consider only users who have performed at least two actions in a period of activity larger than one hour ( i.e. , all users @xmath27 satisfying @xmath35 and @xmath36 . ) .",
    "this restricts the calculations to @xmath37 users in aol and @xmath38 and @xmath39 users in eb and in wp , respectively .",

    "the probability @xmath48 , that two subsequent operations performed by the @xmath27-th user differ by @xmath0 units of time , can be calculated as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the kronecker delta which equals one if @xmath51 and zero otherwise .",
    "@xmath52 stands for the total number of subsequent operations , which differ by @xmath0 , performed by the user @xmath27 .",
    "the normalization of eq.([eq : tau_user ] ) is preserved since @xmath53 .",
    "+ if the population is composed of @xmath54 users , the probability @xmath55 that a generic user performs two subsequent operations which differ by an amount of time @xmath0 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the maximal value of @xmath0 observed in the dataset .",
    "it is important to notice that eq.([eq : tau_population ] ) represents the best estimate for the inter - event time probability distribution function ( pdf ) in the hypothesis that all @xmath48 are the same and basically corresponds to the weighted average of the single userspdfs .",
    "+            the global pdfs @xmath55 calculated for aol , eb and wp are reported in the main plots of fig.s  [ fig3 ] . in order to have much cleaner figures , we express @xmath0 with a resolution of hours . it should be noticed that in all cases the most probable value is @xmath58 , since @xmath59 , which means that the majority of subsequent operations has time difference smaller than thirty minutes .",
    "in particular we have : @xmath60 for aol , @xmath61 for eb and @xmath62 for wp .",

    "@xmath55 has been calculated as the weighted average of the inter - event time pdfs of single users .",
    "as already stated , eq.([eq : tau_population ] ) is the most representative way to calculate @xmath55 only in the hypothesis that all users behave in a similar way .",
    "+ in order to test the reliability of @xmath55 as probability for the inter - event time statistics of each user we make use of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test  @xcite .",
    "ks is non - parametric statistical test which allows to quantify to which extent the hypothesis that two pdfs were drawn from the same underlying distribution is valid . in our specific case ,",
    "we calculate for each user the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath67 and we perform a ks test , comparing this cdf with the one valid for the whole population @xmath68 . from the ks test",
    "we obtain a number @xmath69 which basically quantifies the significance level of similarity between the two distributions : high values of @xmath70 mean that is very probable that the two sets of data have been generated from the same underlying distribution , differently a small @xmath70 tells that the hypothesis of having a common underlying distribution is unlikely .",
    "+ as we can see from fig.s  [ figks ] , in general @xmath55 does not well represent the activity of single users . in these figures ,",
    "we consider the quantity @xmath71 , which stands for the normalized number of users whose inter - event time pdf is described by @xmath55 with a significance level larger or equal to @xmath70 . since @xmath71 is the complementary cdf of the ks cdf , we expect that @xmath72 . from fig.s",
    "[ figks ] , we see obviously that @xmath71 is a decreasing function of @xmath70 , but that it does not follow the expected behavior . it should be noticed that , in the case of wp , @xmath71 follow a functional form very similar to the expected one , but this may be an artifact due to the shape of the correspondent @xmath73 : the global inter - event time pdf is mainly due to the contribution of users with small @xmath20 and the same poorly active users are those who contribute mainly to the value of @xmath71 . just to a give a quantitative idea , we can for example",
    "say that the percentage of users whose inter - event time statistics is described by @xmath55 with a significance of @xmath43 are @xmath74 for aol , @xmath75 for eb and @xmath76 for wp while from ks statistics we expect to have @xmath43 .",
    "the main problem is that the inter - event time pdf of a user is strictly dependent on the total number of operations performed by the same user  @xcite and the pdf of the number of actions performed is wide ( see fig.s  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we therefore consider the inter - event time pdf @xmath77 of users with the same number of operations @xmath20 . for simplicity",
    ", we divide the entire population in @xmath78 sets of users with similar total number of operations .",
    "the divisions corresponds exactly to those used in fig.s  [ fig1 ] , where users are placed into equally spaced bins on the logarithmic scale depending on the total number of actions @xmath20 they have performed  .",
    "we then compute the @xmath77 corresponding to each of these bins . in fig .",
    "[ figks2]a , we consider the eb dataset and plot the inter - event time pdfs corresponding to four different bins : @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( which correspond to average numbers of operations equal to @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ) .",
    "as one can see , @xmath83 in all cases , but the decay exponent @xmath84 changes as a function of @xmath20 : in the represented cases , we have for example @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . in general , @xmath77 well describes the statistics associated with the inter - event times of single users with @xmath20 total actions ( fig .",
    "[ figks2]b ) .",
    "we calculate the quantity @xmath71 also in this case and we find that the percentages of users whose inter - event time pdf is described by @xmath77 with a significance larger than @xmath87 are : @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in general , users with a reasonable small total number of operations behave similarly and @xmath77 well represents the statistics associated with their activity . differently , for large values of @xmath20 , each user behaves in her / his own way and the statistics of her / his inter - event times differ from those of the other users with the same number of operations",

    "the decay exponent @xmath84 is plotted as a function of @xmath20 . in general",
    "we see that @xmath91 decreases while @xmath84 becomes larger as @xmath20 increases .       in the case of the eb dataset .",
    "data are the same as those already plotted in fig .",
    "[ figks2]a , but now each pdf @xmath92 is appropriately rescaled with the average inter - event time @xmath93 of the respective population of users .",

    "@xmath55 is measured by averaging single users inter - event time pdfs , but such average is weighted by the pdf of the users s activity . since the shape of each @xmath92 is different , the resulting @xmath55 represents therefore an hybrid pdf .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the behaviors of single users are different , but only that the assumption that all @xmath0s are drawn from the same underlying distribution is unlikely .",
    "+ the differences between the @xmath92s may depend on finite - size effects : the power - law decay is modulated by periodic oscillations and additionally may be affected by an exponential cutoff .",
    "for example , the difference in the decay exponents , measured in fig .",
    "[ figks2]a , may simply depend on the different range in which each of these functions is defined ( i.e. , the same range in which the power - law fit is performed ) and the former analysis can not be considered conclusive .",
    "+ in this section , we perform an additional statistical test . instead of considering the bare value for the inter - event time @xmath0 ,",
    "we take into account the activity of each single user and consider the rescaled variable @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 represents the average inter - event time between two actions performed by the same user .",
    "the rescaled variable measures therefore the time gap between two consecutive operations relative to the typical ( i.e. , the average ) inter - event time of the single user .",
    "this approach has been already applied in the study of other social systems : e - mail  @xcite and mobile phone  @xcite communication systems , election  @xcite and citation  @xcite analysis . in all these papers",
    ", it is observed that the scaled variables obey a universal principle differently from the unscaled variables which generally follow different behaviors .",
    "it should be noticed that the same results may be obtained by considering @xmath96 ( i.e. , the inverse of the activity ) instead of @xmath95 since they are basically the same quantity and qualitatively similar results may be obtained by considering @xmath97 ( i.e. , the inverse of the total number of operations performed ) instead of @xmath95 since these quantities are linearly correlated ( see fig.s  [ fig2 ] ) . + interestingly , even in the case of our databases , the simple scaling allows to find a nice collapse between curves corresponding to populations with different total number of operations . in fig .",

    "<S> the number of subsequent operations which differ by @xmath0 units of time decays power - like as @xmath0 increases . </S>",
    "<S> we use non - parametric statistical tests in order to estimate the significance level of reliability of global distributions to describe activity patterns of single users . </S>",
    "<S> global inter - event time probability distributions are not representative for the behavior of single users : the shape of single usersinter - event distributions is strongly influenced by the total number of operations performed by the users and distributions of the total number of operations performed by users are heterogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> a universal behavior can be anyway found by suppressing the intrinsic dependence of the global probability distribution on the activity of the users . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression can be performed by simply dividing the inter - event times with their average values . </S>",
    "<S> differently , waiting time probability distributions seem to be independent of the activity of users and global probability distributions are able to significantly represent the replying activity patterns of single users . </S>"
