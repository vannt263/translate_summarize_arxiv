    "in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions @xcite , it is the higgs mechanism that provides a self - consistent framework to generate masses for gauge bosons and charged fermions .",
    "three neutrinos are exactly massless as a straightforward consequence of the symmetry structure of the sm . but",
    "this framework itself can neither predict the values of six quark masses and three charged - lepton masses nor interpret the observed hierarchy of their spectra @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "current neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite indicate that neutrinos are actually massive and lepton flavors are mixed . hence one has to extend the sm in order to gain an insight into the dynamics of fermion mass generation and flavor mixing .",
    "possible new physics beyond the sm is expected to appear far above the fermi scale @xmath6 gev which essentially characterizes the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance , the typical scale of grand unified theories ( guts ) for strong and electroweak interactions @xcite would be @xmath1 gev , while @xmath3 tev is the possible scale of new physics necessary to stabilize the mass of the higgs boson and offer a natural explanation of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . whenever a specific mass model of leptons and ( or ) quarks is built at a certain high energy scale",
    ", one has to make use of the technique of renormalization group equations ( rges ) @xcite to bridge the gap between the model predictions ( at @xmath7 ) and the experimental data ( at @xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , reliable values of running quark and lepton masses are very important for building new physics models and testing their viability .    a systematic estimate of running quark masses at various energy scales was made by fusaoka and koide @xcite in 1998 .",
    "their numerical results have proved to be very useful for people working on both hadronic physics at relatively low energies and electroweak physics and guts at superhigh energies . however ,",
    "a nontrivial update of this work is greatly desirable today because a lot of changes in particle physics have happened since 1998 . on the one hand , some new and more accurate data on fermion masses at low scales",
    "have been accumulated @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "intensive interest has been paid to some new physics scales such as @xmath3 tev to be explored by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and @xmath9 gev which might be relevant to the seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation @xcite .",
    "these energy scales were not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , nor were the running masses of three light neutrinos .",
    "thus we are well motivated to do a new analysis of running fermion masses at a variety of fundamental or interesting energy scales .",
    "let us remark that the present paper is different from ref .",
    "@xcite and other previous works in the following aspects :    * the running masses of three light majorana neutrinos are calculated .",
    "a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data yields strong constraints on two neutrino mass - squared differences ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and three neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) at the @xmath15 confidence level @xcite .",
    "in addition , the latest cosmological constraint on the absolute values of @xmath16 is @xmath17 at the @xmath18 confidence level @xcite .",
    "since the unification of leptons and quarks is only possible at a superhigh energy scale ( e.g. , the gut scale or the seesaw scale ) , it makes sense to calculate the running masses of three light neutrinos together with those of charged fermions .",
    "we shall illustrate the running effects of @xmath19 for @xmath7 by using the rges both in the sm and in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "* the up - to - date values of quark masses @xcite given by the particle data group ( pdg ) at low energies are adopted , and a few new energy scales ( such as @xmath3 tev and @xmath20 gev ) are taken into account .",
    "any models for new physics beyond the sm may introduce new energy scales above the fermi scale , among which the @xmath21 tev scale is most appealing because it will soon be probed by the lhc .",
    "possible new physics at this energy frontier is likely to be responsible for the origin of fermion masses and flavor mixing , or it can at least shed light on these fundamental problems . on the other hand ,",
    "the intriguing seesaw @xcite and leptogenesis @xcite mechanisms have motivated a lot of neutrino physicists to study the properties of heavy majorana neutrinos in order to simultaneously account for the lightness of three known neutrinos and the matter - antimatter asymmetry of our universe .",
    "the particularly interesting mass scales of such heavy majorana particles are @xmath4 gev to @xmath20 gev , where the flavor effects on leptogenesis @xcite have to be treated carefully .",
    "hence we shall make use of the rges to run the lepton and quark masses to these new energy scales , just for the convenience of model builders . * the treatment of quark masses crossing the flavor thresholds",
    "is improved .",
    "we shall use the matching conditions only at the flavor thresholds @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) and calculate light quark masses at any other high energy scales with the help of the rges .",
    "this approach has been clearly described in ref .",

    "the running quark masses between two neighboring flavor thresholds were just computed with the matching conditions in ref .",

    "@xcite and used in our calculations is no doubt more reasonable . * the effective coupling constant @xmath24 , which governs the strength of strong interactions , is calculated by numerically solving its rge .",
    "in contrast , the values of @xmath24 at different energy scales were evaluated via the analytical relation between @xmath24 and the asymptotic scale parameter @xmath25 in ref .",
    "the latter method may result in some unnecessary uncertainties due to the expansion of @xmath26 , as shown in refs .",

    "ii , we summarize the input data which include the current masses of three light quarks at @xmath27 , the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the pole mass of the top quark , the strong gauge coupling @xmath24 and the fine structure constant @xmath30 at @xmath2 .",

    "the strategy to deal with the flavor thresholds and evolve the charged fermion masses to the fermi scale is outlined . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the calculations of running fermion masses up to the gut scale both in the sm and in the mssm .",
    "indeed , the true running parameters above the fermi scale are the yukawa couplings of leptons and quarks because these particles can only acquire their masses after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( i.e. , below the fermi scale ) .",
    "the running masses of three light neutrinos are also illustrated for completeness .",
    "finally , we make a brief summary of our main results in sec .",
    "first of all , let us give some concise comments on the definition of fermion masses .",
    "it is important to specify the theoretical framework when discussing quark masses , since they are renormalization - scheme - dependent .",
    "there are two very common renormalization schemes .",
    "one of them is the on - shell scheme , in which the position of the pole is the definition of the physical mass @xmath31 .",
    "the other is to define the _ running _ or renormalized mass @xmath32 in the dimensional regularization scheme with the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath33 ) , where @xmath34 denotes the renormalization scale .",
    "both definitions are suitable for charged leptons .",
    "but the situation is quite different in the quark sector due to the nonperturbative nature of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energies : light quarks are always confined in hadrons and can never be observed directly . even for the heaviest quark , the top quark , it is impossible to completely eliminate the nonperturbative effect on the value of @xmath35 extracted from the direct measurements . hence the pole mass of a quark is not well - defined .",
    "note that the qcd lagrangian has a chiral symmetry in the limit where all quark masses are vanishing .",
    "the scale of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is @xmath36 @xcite , which can be used to distinguish between light ( @xmath37 for @xmath38 ) and heavy ( @xmath39 for @xmath40 ) quarks .",
    "another important point is the decoupling of heavy flavors . because of the hierarchical mass spectrum of quarks",
    ", one should integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom when considering the properties of light flavors .",
    "therefore , some consistent matching conditions should be established between the full and effective theories at the scales characterized by the masses of heavy flavors .",
    "we shall work in the framework elaborated on in ref .",

    "besides the gauge couplings , the quartic higgs coupling @xmath235 in the sm is also needed in our calculations .",
    "the rge of @xmath236 can be found in ref .",
    "we shall typically take @xmath237 for the higgs mass , just for the sake of illustration .",
    "in the mssm , the free parameter @xmath174 is defined as @xmath238 with @xmath239 and @xmath240 being the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields which couple respectively to the down- and up - type quarks .",
    "note that @xmath241 has been fixed by the measurements of the @xmath242-boson mass and the electroweak gauge coupling . to be specific ,",
    "we shall input @xmath243 and @xmath244 to illustrate the running fermion masses in the cases of small and large @xmath245 .    with the help of the above inputs , we are then able to numerically solve the rges and obtain the running masses of quarks and leptons at various energies above the fermi scale .",
    "our numerical results at @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 are summarized in table iv , table v and table vi , where the uncertainties of the output masses mainly come from those of the input masses at @xmath2 .",
    "some brief comments on these results are in order .    * in both the sm and the mssm",
    ", a common feature of the outputs is that all the quark masses decrease with increasing energy scales",
    ". nevertheless , their running behaviors are quite model - dependent . *",
    "table iv and table vi show that there exists a maximum for the running mass of each charged lepton in the sm .",
    "our numerical analysis indicates that the maximal values of @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 are all located around @xmath253 . in the mssm ,",
    "however , three charged - lepton masses smoothly decrease as the energy scale increases .",
    "* we have ignored large uncertainties of the input values in evaluating the running masses of three light neutrinos , just because the relevant experimental data are quite inaccurate and incomplete .",
    "our numerical results , which rely on several assumptions made above , can only serve for illustration .",
    "we show the scale dependence of running neutrino masses in figs . 1 and 2 for two different mass spectra . comparing between these two figures , we observe that the rge effects on neutrino masses are more significant in the @xmath216 case than in the @xmath214 case .",
    "similar observations have been made by a number of authors before ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "note that the running behaviors of other parameters , such as the ckm and mns mixing angles , cp - violating phases and gauge coupling constants , can be obtained from our program in a straightforward way .",
    "but here we only concentrate on the outputs of running quark and lepton masses .",
    "in this paper , we have updated the running masses of quarks and leptons both in the sm and in the mssm at various energy scales , including @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath256 .",
    "our motivation is simple but meaningful : we want to provide a reliable and up - to - date table of the running quark and lepton masses for particle physicists",
    ". such a table will be very useful for the analysis of hadronic physics at low energies and for the building of new physics models at superhigh energies .    the differences between our work and the previous works ( in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have been summarized in the introductory section of this paper .",
    "for instance , the central value of the strange quark mass @xmath45 at @xmath2 is about 55 mev today , but it was about 93 mev as given in ref .",
    "@xcite about a decade ago .",
    "hence it makes sense to recalculate the values of @xmath45 and other fermion masses at different energy scales .",
    "in particular , we hope that our new results for the running masses of leptons and quarks may help the model builders to get new insight into the flavor dynamics at the energy frontier set by the lhc and in the exciting era of precision neutrino physics .",
