    "an important element in fully understanding the hadronization process is knowledge of the space - time position where the hadronization takes place during the collision . in proton - proton collisions , the spacial position of hadronization transverse to the collision axis is characterized by the radius of a proton , i.e. 1 fm , whereas the hadronization timescale and the longitudinal spacial position , which depends on the product of the longitudinal velocity and hadronization timescale , are not well defined . an order - of - magnitude estimate for the hadronization proper time of a particle of rest mass @xmath2",
    "can be obtained by applying the uncertainty principle in the rest frame of the particle , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the uncertainty in the particle energy and @xmath5 is the uncertainty in the particle hadronization proper time , i.e. the width of the hadronization proper time distribution . since eq .",
    "[ dtau1 ] is evaluated in the rest frame of the particle , then @xmath6 , where @xmath7 has been set to @xmath2 as an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "thus , eq . [ dtau1 ] becomes , @xmath8 where , as the lightest hadron , the pion rest mass sets the upper limit on the width of the hadronization proper time distribution .",
    "several theoretical @xcite and phenomenological @xcite studies of the hadronization ( or formation ) time in proton - proton collisions have been made over the past 30 years .",
    "the phenomenological ones have attempted to extract a single hadronization proper time in each case by comparing a model with two - pion femtoscopy measurements for @xmath9 0.2 @xcite , 0.9 @xcite , and 1.8 @xcite tev collisions , obtaining values in the range of 0.1 - 0.2 fm / c . in a recent phenomenological study comparing the urqmd model @xcite with lhc alice collaboration 3-dimensional two - pion femtoscopy measurements in @xmath0 tev proton - proton collisions @xcite a range for the single hadronization proper time of 0.3 - 0.8 fm / c was obtained .",
    "although the extracted values in these studies are for @xmath10-function distributions of the hadronization proper time rather than widths of finite distributions , the extracted values seem consistent with the order - of - magnitude limit given in eq .",

    "the main differences between the present work and the previous ones are the following :    * rather than using a single hadronization proper time , a more physically motivated gaussian distribution of proper times characterized by a width , @xmath14 , is used in the present work , as in ref .",

    "this suggests that some kind of `` collective motion '' of the system , in the present model being due to rescattering , is needed to explain the measured @xmath63 behavior of @xmath60 in @xmath0 tev proton - proton collisions .",

    "the short - dashed lines represent the equivalent gaussian widths of the freeze - out time distributions and the solid lines represent the equivalent gaussian widths of the freeze - out radius distributions .",
    "the freeze - out time and radius width calculations are restricted to the ranges @xmath76 fm / c and @xmath77 fm , respectively , to exclude the trivially large timescales and sizes which would be introduced by long - lived resonances .",

    "the large physical sizes and timescales are due to a combination of time dilation in the initial state , resonance decays and rescattering dynamics .",
    "it is also seen that the increase in the @xmath60 parameters in going from lower to higher @xmath63 is also reflected in an increase in the physical radii and timescales for pions and kaons , this effect being completely driven in the model by rescattering , as already suggested in comparing figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .     and @xmath81 and gaussian widths of the source radius and time distributions.,width=510 ]    figure  [ fig5 ] shows the time evolution of the energy density at midrapidty , @xmath82 , for the first 5 fm / c from the model averaged over all multiplicities for @xmath69 fm / c . besides the expected decrease in @xmath82",
    "as time evolves due to the expansion of the system , it is seen that @xmath83 for @xmath84 fm / c , reaching @xmath85 gev/@xmath86 at the initial time in the collision .",
    "an estimate of the initial energy density in @xmath0 tev proton - proton collisions based on hydrodynamic calculations has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is also found there that energy densities greater than 1 gev/@xmath86 are initially produced in these collisions , suggesting that a non - hadronic state may be present at the early stages , as is thought to be the case in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . in this scenario ,",
    "the collision evolves from an initial hydrodynamic state made up of partons into the hadronic state with some possible rescattering and finally to freeze - out from which experimental observables are constructed . in this case , one would expect that collective effects seen in the observables would be due to some combination of hydrodynamics of the partons and final - state hadronic rescattering .",
    "the possibility of this hydrodynamic scenario leads to questioning the validity of a purely hadronic picture as is used in the present work which serves as a `` limiting case '' picture .",
    "if a partonic state is indeed initially present , it must evolve eventually into hadrons , and this evolution would likely be gradual in time as opposed to a sudden hadronization of the system as would happen in a first - order phase transition . the simple hadronic rescattering picture could have some degree of validity during this mixed - phase transition period when perhaps `` quasi - hadrons '' are present . even at the earliest times when the system may be purely partonic and thus better described by a hydrodynamic picture , hadronic rescattering is perhaps able to mimic to some degree the early hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "thus , in this partonic scenario the present purely hadronic rescattering model might be thought of as mimicking a `` viscous '' hydrodynamic evolution of the system .",

    "in this work , a hadronic rescattering model with the proper hadronization time width as the free parameter was compared with charged pion and charged and neutral kaon femtoscopy measurements from the lhc alice experiment for @xmath0 tev proton - proton collisions .",
    "comparisons between the model and measurements were made for one - dimensional source parameters in several charged multiplicity and transverse particle pair momentum bins .",

    ". it will be interesting to repeat this study once new data are available from the upgraded lhc for @xmath87 tev proton - proton collisions since the anticipated higher particle multiplicities produced in these collisions should enhance the amount of collectivity present and thus enhance the magnitude of the effects studied in the present work .",
