    "spiral waves are characteristic structures of excitable media @xcite that have been observed in systems as different as catalytic surface oxidation @xcite , the belousov - zhabotinsky chemical reaction @xcite aggregating colonies of slime mold @xcite , and heart tissue where they are suspected to play an essential role in cardiac arrhythmia and fibrillation @xcite .",
    "spiral waves are prone to a variety of instabilities , the best studied of which is meander , and they can be made to drift and be controlled in diverse ways , for instance by varying the medium excitability in space or / and time , or by adding an external field .",
    "much of the observed experimental phenomenology has been reproduced by using simplified two - variable activator - controller types of description , like the classic fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) model @xcite and mild variations of it .",
    "extensive surveys @xcite of the possible types of wave motion in such models have been performed in a reduced parameter space where the only two parameters left to vary are the medium excitability @xmath0 , defined in section ii in such a way that the isolated pulse speed is proportional to @xmath0 for weak excitability , and the ratio @xmath1 between the time scale of the activator and controller kinetics , which controls the abruptness of the wave front ( i.e. the thickness of the interface delimiting the excited region ) .",
    "different regimes have been identified that are summarized in fig .",
    "[ flowergarden ] for simple fn kinetics @xcite . in the whole region above the _ propagation _ boundary ( @xmath2 ) , the medium excitability is too weak for any plane wave to propagate persistently . in the narrower region comprised between @xmath2 and the _ rotor _ boundary ( @xmath3 ) , the medium excitability is sufficient for a plane wave to propagate but not for a spiral wave to form . in this region ,",
    "the end of a broken wave - front , referred hereafter as the ` wave tip ' , simply retracts steadily ( fig .",
    "[ examples]a ) , such that this finger - shaped wave must shrink in length and eventually vanish at boundaries in a finite system . in the even narrower region",
    "comprised between @xmath3 and the _ meander _ boundary ( @xmath4 ) , the excitability is sufficient for large core spirals to form and the wave tip now rotates steadily at a frequency @xmath5 around a circular core of radius @xmath6 .",
    "right on the @xmath3 boundary , a half plane wave , referred hereafter as the `` critical finger '' , propagates without changing its shape .",
    "it can be equivalently interpreted as a retracting finger with vanishing retracting velocity or as a spiral wave of infinite core radius . as one keeps increasing the excitability , the radius of the spiral core decreases and below the @xmath4 boundary the spiral tip traces a classic `` flower - like '' meander pattern ( fig .",
    "[ examples]b ) .",
    "it has been shown that meander originates from a supercritical hopf bifurcation at @xmath4 which adds a second frequency @xmath7 to the basic spiral rotation @xcite .",
    "the meander patterns exhibit first inward petals as @xmath8 .",
    "outward petals appear as @xmath7 becomes greater than @xmath5 . further away from @xmath4 ,",
    "the spiral tip motion becomes more complex and possibly chaotic passed the still poorly characterized @xmath9 boundary @xcite ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ flowergarden ] ) . given that a hopf bifurcation takes place on @xmath4 , symmetry arguments fix its resonant coupling to the translation modes when @xmath10 and thus determine the bifurcation structure of the tip motion near the codimension 2 point @xmath10 on @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this rather detailed knowledge , the precise mechanisms that govern spiral formation and motion remain less well understood from both physical and predictive viewpoints .",
    "a simple picture remains missing to answer even basic questions , such as why does meander occur and why is this instability oscillatory ( i.e. a hopf bifurcation ) beyond numerical observation ? from a predictive viewpoint , we still lack a quantitative analytical understanding of what controls the @xmath4 boundary or the frequency ratio @xmath11 in the parameter space of reaction - diffusion models .",
    "similar uncertainties are to a large extent also present for other phenomena like spiral drift under external action .",
    "a kinematical model of spiral dynamics , aimed at the weakly excitable large core limit , has been proposed some years ago on a purely phenomenological basis @xcite .",
    "it has been helpful to rationalize experimental facts but it has not been derived from the underlying reaction - diffusion equations . thus it remains limited in its predictions , e.g. it falls short of predicting the @xmath4 boundary and the ratio @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , at a more conceptual level , the general validity of the boundary condition assumed for the free end of the wave - front in this kinematic theory has remains somewhat unclear .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to present a rigorous asymptotic derivation of a kinematic theory of spiral wave motion in the weakly excitable and free - boundary limit ( lower left hand corner of fig .",
    "1 ) onto which we focus . as we shall see",
    ", the structure of this theory differs from the one proposed phenomenologically in ref .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to demonstrate , through selected applications of this theory , that it is able to provide a physical and quantitative understanding of a wide range of wave phenomena such as , meander , drift under various external actions considered in previous studies @xcite , and multi - arm spiral wave motion .",
    "highlights of our results include an asymptotically exact treatment of the meander instability for @xmath12 , which gives the precise location of the @xmath4 boundary and shows that the instability arises from a supercritical hopf bifurcation with @xmath13 in this limit , the finding that multi - arm spiral waves with two or more arms are always linearly unstable , in contrast to a previous numerical study @xcite , and predictions of the spiral drift speed and drift angle in an external field .",
    "these results are generally found to be in good quantitative agreement with our simulations of fn kinetics .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the standard free - boundary limit of reaction - diffusion models @xcite described in section ii , which is valid when the excited region is surrounded by a thin interface of width @xmath12 . in this limit",
    ", the fast activator variable is eliminated in favor of an eikonal equation that gives the normal velocity of this boundary .",
    "this velocity generally depends on the local radius curvature of this interface , assumed large compared to @xmath1 , as well as the local value of the slow controller variable at the interface .",
    "this free - boundary problem is non - trivial to solve because it requires to treat both the dynamics of the wave - front , which is the part of the boundary where the excited region propagates into the recovery region of the medium , and the wave - back where the reverse process occurs .",
    "far from the tip , the front and back behave essentially identically , such that a ` single front ' description is rigorously possible . in the tip region , however , the front and back must be matched at the tip ( i.e. point of zero normal velocity along the boundary ) , which is a difficult task .",
    "for this reason a single - front description with a somewhat arbitrary tip condition was first used historically to relate the steady rotation frequency and core radius of spirals @xcite .",
    "the kinematic theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is an attempt to extend this picture to an unsteady situation .",
    "subsequent solutions of the complete free - boundary problem , with a rigorous matching of front and back that provides a unique and independent determination of the spiral frequency and wavelength , focused on two limits .",
    "one of these limits ( see @xcite and earlier references therein ) is obtained mathematically by assuming @xmath12 while keeping @xmath0 fixed of order unity , which corresponds physically to a highly excitable medium .",
    "the wavelength and frequency obey in this limit @xcite certain scaling laws with @xmath1 first proposed by fife @xcite .",
    "the wave - front and wave - back , however , are matched onto singular core solutions ( of size @xmath1 with only activator diffusion ) that have later been shown to be generically unstable @xcite ; this result actually seems to concord with the numerical observation of complex meander ( and thus unstable motion ) in this limit @xcite .",
    "thus these solutions do not provide a proper starting point for a kinematic theory aimed to describe the onset of meander .",
    "a better starting point , on which we focus here , is the second limit originating from ref .",
    "@xcite where one constructs smooth core solutions to the free - boundary problem .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this can in fact only be consistently done for a weakly excitable medium when the radius of curvature of the boundary at the tip remains much larger than the front and back interface width , i.e. by assuming simultaneously @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "this allowed a rigorous derivation of the line @xmath3 in the weak excitability limit @xcite in good quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of fitzhugh - nagumo kinetics ( lower left hand corner of fig .  1 )",
    ", as well as a semi - analytic derivation of the selected core radius / frequency of spiral waves and retracting wave speed in the same limit @xcite .",
    "the present kinematic theory is derived by first refining analytically the description of steady retraction and rotation in this weakly excitable limit ( section iv ) , and then extending it to an unsteady regime ( section v ) for the non - trivial case of self interacting spirals , i.e. where the wave tip motion is influenced by the average controller concentration left by the previous passage of the wave - front .",
    "this allows us to derive an equation of motion for the wave tip that is then used to analyze meander in a linear and nonlinear regime ( section vi ) .",
    "results of these two sections have been summarized in a previous short publication @xcite .",
    "further applications of the kinematic theory are then contained in subsequent sections that include spiral drift under various external actions without self - interaction ( section vii ) and interacting multi - arm spiral waves ( section viii ) .",
    "finally , corrections to the large core results are discussed in section [ smallcore ] and several points are further analyzed in four appendices .",
    "in addition , for clarity of exposition , we have found best to first give a simple physical picture of the kinematic theory and summarize the main results of its application in section iii .",
    "this section is purposely aimed to discuss this theory in terms of experimentally measurable quantities as well as to provide a guide to the rest of the paper .",
    "we consider the classic activator ( @xmath15 ) controller ( @xmath16 ) two - variable reaction - diffusion model of excitable media @xcite @xmath17 with a linearly stable rest state ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we focus in this paper on the singly diffusive case @xmath19 , although we shall also briefly consider the slow controller diffusion limit @xmath20 in section [ seclinstab ] .",
    "the @xmath15-nullcline ( @xmath21 ) is assumed to have the standard s - shape in the @xmath22 plane .",
    "a simple choice of fn kinetics that we use for the numerical simulations is @xmath23 , @xmath24 with the rest state @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eqd1 ] ) and ( [ eqd2 ] ) in a standard dimensionless form by measuring time and length in units of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , which yields for the singly diffusive case @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "we study this dimensionless form of the equations in the rest of this paper , except in the next section where we summarize the essential ingredients of the kinematic theory in dimensional units . for small @xmath1 , the excited region ( @xmath30 with the previous choice ) of a propagating wave",
    "is separated by a sharp boundary from the unexcited or recovering medium ( @xmath31 with the previous choice ) .",
    "the wave description can thus be reduced to determining the motion of its boundary ( i.e. a free boundary problem ) @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the normal velocity of the interface separating the excited and recovery regions of the medium denoted by ( @xmath34 ) and ( @xmath35 ) , respectively , @xmath36 is the local curvature of this interface , and @xmath37 denotes the right - most ( @xmath38 ) and left - most ( @xmath39 ) branch of the @xmath15-nullcline ( @xmath21 ) . the function @xmath40 is entirely determined by eq .",
    "( [ eqrd1 ] ) with @xmath16 fixed .",
    "we measure the excitability of the medium , i.e. the threshold stimulus necessary to cause a response , by the parameter @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the stall value of @xmath16 at which @xmath43 .",
    "the isolated pulse speed @xmath44 is then a monotonously increasing function of @xmath0 with @xmath45 for @xmath46 for our numerical choice ) . for values of of @xmath16 near @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( [ veq ] ) can be simplified even further to @xmath47 where the activator time scale @xmath48 controls the pulse duration and the recovery time @xmath49 is the time scale over which the controller variable returns to its rest state after an excitation ( for our numerical choice , @xmath50 ) .",
    "in a typical chemical or biological excitable media , many parameters ( chemical or ionic concentrations , temperature , light etc . ) , control the excitability of the medium .",
    "however , independently of the complexity of the medium , it is generally possible to construct a single dimensionless parameter @xcite @xmath51 which determines whether the tip rotates , and thus forms a spiral wave , or whether it simply retracts .",
    "this parameter is expressed as the ratio of two lengthscales that characterize the tip region of a broken plane wave that is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figcoord ] .",
    "the first is the radius of curvature @xmath52 of the wave boundary at the tip . in the limit ( @xmath12 ) where this boundary is thin ,",
    "@xmath52 is obtained by applying the eikonal equation at the tip , which yields @xmath53 , and thus @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the plane wave speed .",
    "the second lengthscale @xmath56 is the constant width of the excited region away from the tip . as argued in @xcite , the wave boundary in the tip region",
    "can only be smooth if @xmath57 , such that the @xmath3 boundary must correspond to a fixed value of @xmath58 of order unity ; an explicit calculation ( refs . @xcite and section iv.a here )",
    "yields @xmath59 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the excitability of the medium is not sufficient to overcome diffusion in the most highly curved part of the tip region , which retracts .",
    "in contrast for @xmath61 , the excitability is sufficient to overcome retraction , and the increase of @xmath33 away from the tip induces rotation .",
    "increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath62 corresponds to decreasing ( increasing ) the excitability of the medium while moving normal to the @xmath3 boundary in the multi - dimensional parameter space that characterizes a given excitable medium .",
    "@xmath62 is therefore the most natural parameter to characterize this excitability close to this boundary , and is used throughout this paper . from an experimental standpoint ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are in principle measurable quantities and @xmath63 can be either measured or estimated , such that one could attempt to quantify @xmath62 directly .",
    "of course , in practice , the definition of @xmath56 , and thus @xmath62 , becomes less precise when @xmath1 is not small and it is simpler to use an experimental control parameter @xmath64 ( such as a concentration ) that can be varied to cross the @xmath3 boundary .",
    "therefore we will briefly describe in subsection [ subsecc ] a more direct way to obtain a quantitative relationship between @xmath62 and @xmath64 close to the @xmath3 boundary without the need to use eq .",
    "( [ bdef ] ) .",
    "close to the @xmath3 boundary , we will show that a spiral wave in its tip region , behaves as a ` rigid body ' whose motion can be characterized by giving two _ instantaneous _ quantities : the tip tangential velocity @xmath65 , and its rotation rate @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the radius of curvature of the tip trajectory as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figcoord ] .",
    "two key ingredients make this kinematic description possible .",
    "the first is that , near @xmath3 , the wave shape is close to a critical finger ( i.e. the broken plane wave that simply translates without retraction or rotation for @xmath58 ) on a length scale @xmath68 ( as explained in section iv.c ) that is large compared to the scale of the tip itself @xmath54 .",
    "the second is that the relations that govern @xmath69 and @xmath70 are established on time scales that are both much shorter than the steady rotation period , @xmath71 , as discussed at the start of section v and in quantitative details in appendix b. this separation of time scales , which makes our adiabatic treatment possible , becomes exact in the large core limit @xmath72 , but , importantly , it does not depend on @xmath1 being small .",
    "therefore the present kinematic description should rigorously extend beyond the free - boundary limit but we shall assume that @xmath12 in this paper to compute @xmath69 .    a key difference between this description and the one proposed in @xcite should already be apparent .",
    "namely here , the dynamics is driven entirely by the rigid tip region ( which is just a point on the core scale ) .",
    "in contrast , in the kinematic model of @xcite , the tip motion is determined by the wave - front dynamics via a boundary condition imposed at the tip . in the present context , the dynamics of the spiral wave - front outside the tip region _",
    "need not _ be invoked to calculate the tip motion .",
    "the tip tangential velocity is determined by the controller concentration ( equivalently the spatial variation of excitability in which the wave - front propagates ) in the tip neighborhood . to compute this velocity we exploit the fact that , close to the @xmath3 boundary , the equations of motion can be linearized around the critical finger .",
    "this allows us to obtain a solvability condition ( i.e. a general condition for the existence of a solution to these linearized equations ) that uniquely relates the tangential velocity @xmath73 to an arbitrary spatial distribution of @xmath16 ; this distribution is only constrained to deviate slightly from the rest state @xmath74 in order for the wave tip to remain close to the critical finger .",
    "this solvability condition is first used in section iv.b in the simplest steady - state situation where the tip propagates into a uniform controller concentration .",
    "the result of interest is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a numerical constant .",
    "this result implies that on the weak excitability side of the @xmath3 boundary ( @xmath60 ) , steady retracting waves form with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the tip retracting speed . on the other side ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "spiral forms with @xmath79 and a second relation discussed in the next subsection is needed in this case to determine the rotation rate .",
    "the calculation of the tangential velocity is extended to the case of steady self - interacting spirals that propagate in a not fully recovered medium in section iv.d , to unsteady self - interacting spirals in section v.b , and to spirals in an external field in section vii.b . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath80 depends both on the controller concentration and the components @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the external field respectively parallel and orthogonal to @xmath69 .",
    "a relation between @xmath62 and an arbitrary experimental control parameter @xmath64 can be obtained close to the @xmath3 boundary by simply measuring the slope @xmath83 of the curve @xmath84 vs @xmath64 , which should be the same on both sides of @xmath3 and presumably simpler to obtain on the retracting side .",
    "it then follows at once from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) that @xmath85 close to @xmath3 , where @xmath86 is the value of @xmath64 where @xmath3 is crossed .",
    "this relationship can be used to relate quantitatively the results of the rest of this paper to experiments , keeping in mind that these results are only accurate asymptotically close to @xmath3 and for small @xmath1 .",
    "the motion of the wave tip region , although rigid , must generally be consistent with the motion of the rest of the wave - front away from the tip . on the spiral side of @xmath3 ,",
    "the tip region must necessarily rotate to accommodate the fact that its tip end translates at a slower speed than the plane waves radiated outward from the core ( on the other side of @xmath3 , @xmath87 simply implies retraction of the tip ) .",
    "in section iv.c , we show that the tip and the far regions can be matched on the gently curved intermediate scale @xmath88 , yielding a rotation rate @xmath89 , with @xmath90^{3/2}\\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is a constant that is obtained by matching the curved tip and far regions .",
    "it should be noted that this constant differs from the constant @xmath92 @xcite obtained by arbitrarily imposing a radial departure of the wavefront from the steady - state circular core trajectory as in ref .",
    "the 3/2 exponent , however , is the same both here and in ref .",
    "@xcite since it does not depend on details of the matching on the tip scale .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) holds both for steady rotation ( in the context of which it is derived in section iv.c ) and for unsteady rotation owing to the aforementioned adiabatic approximation . for steady rotation , the core radius @xmath6",
    "is simply obtained by substituting the expression for @xmath69 from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , which yields , @xmath93^{3/2}\\label{e3}\\ ] ] the generalization to self - interacting spirals is given in section iv.d .",
    "knowing how to compute @xmath69 and @xmath70 gives in principle a complete kinematic theory of the wave tip motion , since this uniquely predicts the euclidean trajectory of the tip in time .",
    "however to characterize analytically the tip dynamics in unsteady situations ( such as drift , meander , etc ) it is convenient to measure the instantaneous tip position by the standard polar coordinates @xmath94 with respect to a fixed origin at the center of steady rotation ( fig .",
    "[ coordinates ] ) , and to relate the tip motion in these coordinates to @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this part of our analysis is carried out in section v.a and yields a simple forced harmonic oscillator equation @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the radial displacement of the wave tip from its radius @xmath6 of steady rotation and @xmath97 .",
    "( [ osci ] ) is valid for a small radial displacement ( @xmath98 ) and is accompanied by an independent equation for the angular displacement @xmath99 from steady rotation . for a small radial displacement , however , the two equations are not coupled such that @xmath100 can be computed independently . without forcing , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) , namely an harmonic motion at frequency @xmath5 , is a simple superposition of the two translation modes : it gives the tip displacement of a steady spiral which is slightly translated with respect to the reference unperturbed spiral .",
    "in summary , the application of the present kinematic theory contains three steps : ( i ) using a solvability condition to calculate @xmath69 in terms of the local controller concentration , external field , etc .",
    ", with a resulting expression that depends on the situation considered , ( ii ) using eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) to express @xmath70 in terms of @xmath69 , and ( iii ) solving eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) to obtain the radial displacement of the tip for a given forcing , which also obviously depends on the situation considered .",
    "we now summarize the result of this procedure for the selected applications examined in this paper ( in a different order than in subsequent sections ) .    the simplest example ( section vii.a ) is to compute the the tip motion induced by a small periodic spatially uniform variation of excitability @xmath101 . following the above steps , and using the fact that the perturbation is small , we obtain at once @xmath102 where the function @xmath103 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , and @xmath104 is to be evaluated at @xmath105 .",
    "this resonant forced harmonic oscillator equation has a growing sinusoidal solution with an amplitude that increases linearly in time , and which thus corresponds to a spiral drift at a speed @xmath106 , or @xmath107 in an experiment .",
    "the action of an electric field is considered in section [ efield ] and produces a similar type of periodic forcing that leads to spiral drift . in agreement with previous studies @xcite the spiral",
    "is found to drift at an angle with the external field .",
    "this result also determines the curvature - induced motion of a scroll filament .",
    "there the main prediction is that rings expand in the large core limit ( i.e. the filament tension is negative ) in agreement with previous numerical observations in this limit ( see @xcite and earlier references therein ) .    in the case of meander the tip tangential velocity and",
    "hence the forcing on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) depends on the radial displacement @xmath108 of the tip after one complete rotation ( fig .  [ coordinates ] )",
    "due to the self - interaction of the wave - front with its own recovery tail .",
    "if this displacement is positive , the average controller concentration will be slightly more elevated in the tip region ( i.e. the medium will be slightly less excitable in this region ) than if it is negative , which then affects @xmath73 and thus @xmath70 and the forcing of the tip .",
    "this effect leads to a differential equation with delay of the form @xmath109 where we have defined the dimensionless radial displacement @xmath110 , the parameter @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is a @xmath113-shaped function which we compute in section v.b .",
    "the saturation of @xmath112 at large radial displacement is due to the fact that the controller concentration only varies appreciably on the scale of @xmath52 . a linear stability analysis of this equation in section vi.a yields that the onset of meander occurs when @xmath114 exceeds a threshold @xmath115 $ ] that depends in a singular way on the diffusivity ratio @xmath116 and @xmath1 .",
    "namely , the function @xmath112 is non - analytic at @xmath117 in the pure sharp boundary limit ( [ eikonal],[veq ] ) of the singly diffusive model , which sheds some light on difficulties that were previously encountered when attempting to perform a linear stability analysis in this limit @xcite .",
    "however , for a finite interface width @xmath118 , small compared to the spiral tip radius @xmath119 , the slope at the origin is finite , with @xmath120 , such that there is a finite meander threshold that will be typically of order unity in experiments or simulations .",
    "in addition , this analysis predicts that @xmath121 at onset in the large core limit and a simple physical interpretation of both the existence of a threshold and oscillatory motion is given at the end of section vi.a .",
    "slightly away from the large core limit , the discussion in section ix leads to a modified differential equation with delay that shows that @xmath11 increases above @xmath122 as the core radius @xmath6 is decreased , in semi - quantitative agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "this actually provides a simple picture of the onset of quasiperiodicity ( i.e. how @xmath11 becomes irrational ) as one moves away from the large core limit .",
    "finally , for spirals with @xmath123 arms , we obtain a system of @xmath123 coupled differential equations with delay and with the interaction between the arms controlled by the parameter @xmath124 .",
    "an exact linear stability analysis shows that , unlike for meander , there is no finite threshold of instability .",
    "moreover , this instability develops on a time scale proportional to @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 , such that the time necessary to observe it grows exponentially as the @xmath3 boundary is approached .",
    "we start by analyzing steady wave patterns of the free boundary problem ( [ eikonal]-[inkin ] ) .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , when excitability is decreased , the spiral core radius and spiral period diverge on the line @xmath3 with @xmath129 which marks the lower excitability limit of spiral wave propagation in the ( @xmath130 ) plane .",
    "as described in section i , on the line @xmath3 , spirals degenerate into critical fingers that translate at @xmath55 , the plane wave speed . for @xmath131 ,",
    "the steady waves are retracting fingers .",

    "we then proceed and study steady patterns in the neighborhood of @xmath132 by perturbation around the critical fingers . on the retracting wave side ,",
    "we determine the tangential speed of the tip as a function of @xmath133 by a solvability condition @xcite .",
    "this is the simplest example of the method that we will use in more complicated situations to determine the tip tangential speed . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the critical finger winds up around its tip and becomes a steady spiral rotating around a circular core @xmath6 at a constant tangential speed @xmath69 .",
    "we first consider the case where @xmath6 is large enough so that the spiral front interface can be assumed to propagate in the medium rest state ( i.e. the disturbance of the medium induced by the tip previous passage can be neglected ) .",
    "we obtain analytically the divergence of the spiral radius by adding to the previous determination of @xmath69 , an analysis of the burton - cabrera - frank ( bcf ) equation @xcite in the large radius limit using matched asymptotics , thus confirming the laws obtained in ref.@xcite . finally , we determine the modification of the steady spiral parameters induced by the perturbation of the medium characteristics due to previous passages of the spiral .",
    "we now examine the critical fingers that propagate in a shape preserving way at the pulse speed @xmath55 on the boundary @xmath132 in the parameter space @xmath135 . for a small medium excitability ,",
    "the scaling of the line @xmath132 is easily determined by comparing two lengthscales @xcite as reviewed in section iii.a .",
    "firstly , the condition that the normal velocity vanishes at the wave tip requires that the tip radius of curvature is equal to @xmath136 .",
    "this gives the order of magnitude of the distance between the wave front and back interfaces .",
    "secondly , the front and back interfaces should move at the same velocity .",
    "the value of the controller field @xmath16 should therefore increase from @xmath137 on the front interface to @xmath138 on the back interface in a time @xmath139 .",

    "a wave tip displaced outward from the center at a given passage , will propagate , at its next passage , in a medium more excitable than the one produced by steady rotation .",
    "this will cause the tip to execute this second turn on a smaller radius and thus , to propagate again in a less excitable medium and with a larger radius at the next cycle , leading to the period doubling behavior .",

    "unfortunately , a numerical check of this non - monotonic behavior would require simulating spirals of very large core radius .",
    "this appears a difficult task with present - day computers .",
    "we have developed an analytical approach to spiral waves close to the line @xmath3 where the spiral rotates around a large core and in the free boundary limit where the medium exhibits an abrupt response to a stimulus ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the main ingredient of our analysis has been to note that in this limit the entire wave tip can be treated as an essentially rigid body , the slow motion of which is controlled by the local spatial gradient of excitability in the medium in a way that can be precisely deduced from the starting reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "this has provided a simple understanding of the spiral tip motion and a precise reduction of its dynamics to that of a single point .",
    "this has allowed us to describe the hopf bifurcation nature of the meander instability and to derive simply , but with precise asymptotic estimates , spiral drift due to spatial or temporal variation of excitability , or due an imposed external field .",
    "this last computation determines in particular the drift angle of the spiral with the external field and also the parameters governing the motion of an average scroll wave filament ( curvature has been found to be destabilizing in the large core regime ) . in addition , our analysis has allowed us to elucidate a generic instability of multiarmed spiral waves that was previously missed in numerical simulations in the large core limit because it develops very slowly .",
    "the present analysis can be compared with several previous analytical approaches which have provided insights into spiral wave dynamics . as already noted , a phenomenological kinematical model of spiral wave dynamics@xcite",
    "has been proposed several years ago and has succeeded in capturing many aspects of spiral wave motion .",
    "it differs from the present approach not only because its parameters need to be adjusted and can not be obtained from the underlying reaction - diffusion equation but also more fundamentally because , here the dynamics of the spiral tip is reduced to an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) and drives the motion of the rest of the spiral arm whereas in the kinematical model of @xcite the tip motion follows from that of the whole curve .",
    "moreover , the tip motion is described here in a different way , by the tip rotation rate and not by a growing or retracting velocity as in @xcite .",
    "another notable approach is based on normal forms @xcite . as in our case",
    ", the tip motion is described by ode .",
    "the normal from approach postulates the existence of a hopf bifurcation and it describes its coupling to the spiral translation modes and the resulting tip motion based on general symmetry arguments , close to the resonant case where the meander frequency @xmath7 is equal to the basic spiral rotation frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the present approach is restricted to a particular limit but makes more specific predictions .",
    "besides providing determined parameters in the reduced equation which gives , for instance , the drift angle with an external field , it has the advantage , in our view , to provide an understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the very existence of spiral waves and of their dynamics , be it meander or drift due to external action .",
    "extensions of the present work can be considered in several directions : + - it would be interesting to extend the analysis to slightly more excitable media to capture hypermeandering or at least the change from inward to outward petals ( i.e. the line @xmath740 ) .",
    "this would require going beyond our adiabatic approximation and considering the dynamics of the intermediate region .",
    "+ - the large core nature of the spiral rotation ( i.e. the proximity of the line @xmath3 ) is an essential element of our approach but several of our arguments do not really require sharp front and back interfaces ( i.e. @xmath741 ) .",
    "this is certainly true for the @xmath742 divergence of the spiral radius divergence near the line @xmath3 which only requires that the spiral normal velocity and curvature be related by an eikonal equation of the type of eq .",
    "( [ eikonal ] ) on a sufficiently large scale .",
    "this is also the case for the validity of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "thus , it appears that a computation of critical fingers and of the allied solvability conditions at finite @xmath1 would provide an extension of our reduced description to the neighborhood of the full line @xmath3 .",
    "this would not accurately describe meander(since @xmath3 and @xmath4 are close only for @xmath741 ) but would allow a simple quantitative description of spiral drift and other phenomena along this line .",
    "+ - finally , it appears possible to extend some of our calculations to scroll waves in 3d as succinctly described for filament motion in section ( [ efield ] ) .",

    "<S> in a weakly excitable medium , characterized by a large threshold stimulus , the free end of an isolated broken plane wave ( wave tip ) can either rotate ( steadily or unsteadily ) around a large excitable core , thereby producing a spiral pattern , or retract causing the wave to vanish at boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> an asymptotic analysis of spiral motion and retraction is carried out in this weakly excitable large core regime starting from the free - boundary limit of the reaction - diffusion models , valid when the excited region is delimited by a thin interface . </S>",
    "<S> the wave description is shown to naturally split between the tip region and a far region that are smoothly matched on an intermediate scale . </S>",
    "<S> this separation allows us to rigorously derive an equation of motion for the wave tip , with the large scale motion of the spiral wavefront slaved to the tip . </S>",
    "<S> this kinematic description provides both a physical picture and exact predictions for a wide range of wave behavior , including : ( i ) steady rotation ( frequency and core radius ) , ( ii ) exact treatment of the meandering instability in the free - boundary limit with the prediction that the frequency of unstable motion is half the primary steady frequency ( iii ) drift under external actions ( external field with application to axisymmetric scroll ring motion in three - dimensions , and spatial or / and time - dependent variation of excitability ) , and ( iv ) the dynamics of multi - armed spiral waves with the new prediction that steadily rotating waves with two or more arms are linearly unstable . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of fitzhug - nagumo kinetics are used to test several aspects of our results . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we discuss the semi - quantitative extension of this theory to finite cores and pinpoint mathematical subtleties related to the thin interface limit of singly diffusive reaction - diffusion models . </S>"
