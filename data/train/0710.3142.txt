    "applications of perturbation theory in quantum mechanics require summations over a complete set of states of the lowest - order hamiltonian .",
    "usually , the relevant spectrum is innumerable . in practical applications such eigenspectra",
    "are often modeled using finite basis sets , chosen to be numerically complete . since the sets are finite , the otherwise infinite summations become amendable to numerical evaluations .",
    "the use of a finite basis set composed of piecewise polynomials , so - called b - splines  @xcite , has proven to be particularly advantageous in atomic physics and quantum chemistry applications  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "an atom is placed in a sufficiently large cavity and the atomic wavefunctions are expanded in terms of the underlying b - spline set .",
    "further , the variational galerkin method is invoked and the solution of the resulting matrix eigenvalue problem produces a quasi - spectrum for the atom . in non - relativistic calculations ,",
    "the lowest - energy orbitals of the resulting basis set closely agree with those of the unperturbed atom , and calculations of various properties of the low - lying states can be carried out .",
    "in particular , one could generate single - particle orbitals in some suitable lowest - order approximation , and use the resulting basis set in applications of many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) .",
    "application of the outlined approach to the _ relativistic _ problems brings in a complication the appearance in the atomic quasi - spectrum of non - physical `` spurious '' states .",
    "these states appear in the solution of the single - particle radial dirac equation for @xmath1 angular symmetry , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 orbitals ) .",
    "the spurious states rapidly oscillate and , moreover , spoil the mapping of the generated quasi - spectrum onto the low - energy orbitals of the atom . at the same time",
    "they are required for keeping the set complete .",
    "the problem of spurious states was discussed in the literature in details , see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and several solutions were proposed . in the pioneering applications of the b - splines in relativistic many - body problem by the notre dame group , @xcite added an artificial potential spike centered at the origin to the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the overall effect was to shift the spurious states to higher energies thus restoring the low - energy mapping to the physical states .",
    "we will refer to the sets generated using this prescription as the notre dame ( nd ) sets .",
    "another solution was to use `` kinetically - balanced '' sets  @xcite , which related the small and the large components of the basis set functions via the pauli approximation .",
    "recently , an extension of this method was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , due to additional relations between the small and large components , the negative ( dirac sea ) and positive",
    "energy spectra are treated in a symmetric fashion . to emphasize this built - in symmetry",
    ", the authors refer to their method as the `` dual - kinetic - balance '' ( dkb ) approach . in both methods ( by contrast to the nd prescription )",
    ", the spurious states were shown to be completely eliminated from the quasi - spectrum .",
    "motivated by the success of the dkb method in computing properties of hydrogen - like ions@xcite , here we investigate the suitability of the dkb method in modeling the spectrum of the ( non - local ) dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) potential .",
    "we compare the performance of the nd and dkb methods by computing various properties of cs atom : single - particle energies , hyperfine integrals , and the parity - non - conserving amplitude of the @xmath0 transition .",
    "we find that for properties involving matrix elements accumulated near the nucleus , the dkb method outperforms the nd approach . otherwise ,",
    "if the electronic integrals are accumulated far from the nucleus , both methods produce results of a similar quality .",
    "in addition , we investigate a possibility of using varying number of basis set functions for different angular symmetries .",
    "summations over intermediate states in expressions of perturbation theory are carried out both over angular quantum numbers @xmath4 and for fixed @xmath4 over radial quantum numbers .",
    "usually , as @xmath5 ( and @xmath6 ) increases , the correlation corrections due to higher partial waves become progressively smaller .",
    "intuitively , one expects that for higher partial waves it would be sufficient to use smaller radial basis sets of lesser quality .",
    "this would reduce storage requirements for many - body calculations ( for example , in implementing coupled - cluster formalism ) and would speed up numerical evaluations .",
    "while such an approach is common in quantum chemistry , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite , the question of building the optimal b - spline basis set was not addressed yet in relativistic many - body calculations .",
    "we illustrate optimizing the basis sets by computing the second - order energy correction for several states of cs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we recapitulate the galerkin - type approach to generating a finite - basis set quasi - spectrum for the dirac equation in section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "the variational method is invoked for relativistic action and the problem is reduced to solving the generalized eigenvalue problem in section  [ sec : matrix ] .",
    "the dhf potential is specified in section  [ sec : pot ] .",
    "further we specify nd and dkb sets in section  [ sec : ndanddkb ] and boundary conditions in section  [ sec : spubnd ] .",
    "a numerical analysis of cs atom is provided in section  [ sec : numerics ] . in sections  [ sec :",
    "enhfi ] and  [ sec : pnc ] we compare the performance of the nd and the dkb sets by computing single - particle energies , hyperfine integrals ( section  [ sec : enhfi ] ) , and parity - nonconserving amplitudes ( section  [ sec : pnc ] ) using both methods .",
    "the spurious states arising from the nd method are examined in section  [ sec : spur ] . in section  [ sec : e2 ] we consider second - order energy corrections in the dkb method and discuss a strategy of optimizing the size of the basis set .",
    "we are interested in solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath7 for the dirac hamiltonian , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the nuclear potential and @xmath10 is the mean - field ( dirac - hartree - fock ) potential .",
    "@xmath10 is in general a non - local potential .",

    "we will specify these two terms below .",
    "we employ two finite basis sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 , which , since we are interested in solving the ( angularly - decoupled ) radial equations , may depend on the angular quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "we may expand the large and small components in terms of these bases @xmath28 the expansion coefficients being the same for both the large and the small components .",
    "the above expansions are plugged into the action , eq .",

    "one should notice that for a basis that includes partial waves @xmath73 , for a faithful representation of the small-@xmath67 behavior in all the partial waves , one needs to require the order of the splines to be at least of @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 .    when the first b - spline of the set , @xmath77 , is included in the basis ( as in the nd approach ) , there is another difficulty in the calculations : since it s value does not vanish at @xmath20 , the matrix elements @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which contain matrix elements of @xmath80 , are infinite in absolute value  @xcite . in practical calculations ,",
    "one uses gaussian quadratures to evaluate this integral , so the result of the integration is finite .",
    "yet this introduces arbitrariness in the nd calculations and may be a reason for a relatively poor representation of the orbitals near the origin .    at the cavity radius , to avoid overspecifying the boundary conditions for the dirac equation , the nd group used the boundary condition @xmath81 .",
    "as with the conditions at the origin , this relation was encouragedvariationally .",
    "in our calculations ( similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite ) we use the hard  condition @xmath82 by removing the last b - spline from the set .",
    "examination of the resulting orbitals reveals that the wavefunctions acquire a non - physical inflection towards the end of the supporting grid , while the nd orbitals behave properly .",
    "further numerical experimentation , however , shows that the inflection does not degrade the numerical quality at least for the atomic properties of the low - lying bound states of interest .",
    "at the same time , throwing away the last b - spline reduces the number of basis functions and leads to a more compact set .    to summarize",
    ", we will use the dkb basis set that includes b - splines with sequential numbers @xmath83 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : imin ] ) to @xmath84",
    ". we will simply refer to this choice as the dkb basis .",
    "when we refer to @xmath85 dkb functions for a given partial wave , it would imply larger underlying b - spline set , e.g. , for @xmath86-waves the total number of b - splines would be @xmath87 . for the nd basis @xmath88 , as all b - splines participate in the expansion .    in the remainder of this paper we present results of numerical analysis for @xmath89cs atom .",
    "it is an atom with a single valence electron outside a closed - shell core . as the first step we carry out finite - difference dirac - hartree - fock calculations for cs core .",
    "the core orbitals are fed into the spline code where they are used to compute the matrix elements of the @xmath90 potential , eq.([eq : vdhf ] ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite the numerical accuracy is monitored by comparing the resulting quasi - spectrum with the dhf energies from the finite - difference code .",

    "we compare the performance of the nd and the dkb sets .",
    "we generate the quasi - spectrum using both nd and dkb sets and carry out comparisons for single - particle energies and hyperfine integrals in section  [ sec : enhfi ] and parity - nonconserving amplitude in section  [ sec : pnc ] .",

    "we compare nd and dkb quasi - spectrums with energies obtained using a finite - difference dhf code for the low - lying valence states in table  [ tab : enhfi ] .",
    "the nd and dkb calculations were carried out using @xmath85 basis functions for b - splines of order @xmath75 .",
    "we used a cavity of radius @xmath91 bohr . for the cavity of this size ,",
    "only a few lowest - energy orbitals remain relatively unperturbed by the cavity . from examining table  [ tab : enhfi ] , it is clear that both nd and dkb sets have a similar accuracy for energies .",
    "in the second part of table  [ tab : enhfi ] we compare values of the radial integrals entering matrix elements of the hyperfine interaction due to the electric ( ej ) and magnetic ( mj ) multipolar moments of a point - like nucleus @xmath92 the angular selection rules require @xmath93 .",
    "we use identical integration grid for all three cases ( dhf , nd , dkb ) listed in the table .",
    "the grid is sufficiently dense near the origin , it contains about 100 points inside the nucleus .",
    "the numerical integration excludes the first interval of the grid . from examining the table",
    "we find that the dkb set outperforms the nd basis .",
    "while the nd set still recovers two - three significant figures for the magnetic - dipole coupling , it produces wrong results for electric - quadrupole and magnetic - octupole integrals .",
    "certainly , the accuracy in the nd case improves for a larger basis set , but larger basis sets come at an additional computational cost .",
    "we carried out similar comparisons for matrix elements of the electric - dipole operator .",
    "as for the energies , we find that both the nd and dkb sets perform with a similar numerical accuracy .",
    "as we have mentioned , @xmath94 variationally encourages the boundary condition @xmath95 . however , there is no such explicit encouragement for @xmath96 .",
    "here we qualitatively discuss the observed properties of the radial components near the origin for the cs nd set .",
    "we see that , though their general behavior is to approach zero , the large component wavefunctions often have small improper inflections or oscillations near the origin .",
    "small component wavefunctions , on the other hand , often do not even approach zero .",
    "these improper behaviors seem to be exemplified as we look at states higher in the spectrum . as we have seen here , such improper behavior of both the large and small component radial functions near the origin prove detrimental for properties accumulated near the nucleus .",
    "we conclude that while producing the results of a similar quality for matrix elements accumulated far from @xmath20 , the dkb set provides a better approximation to the atomic orbitals near the nucleus .",

    "the comparison with the nd set shows that , at least for the pnc amplitude , the nd convergence pattern becomes affected by the inaccurate representation of the orbitals near the nucleus ( this is exemplified for states higher in the spectrum ) , while the dkb set exhibits a monotonic convergence . additionally , the dkb set is devoid of spurious states , and therefore the incidental inclusion of spurious states in summations over intermediate states is of no concern .",

    "it is also interesting to analyze the effect of the spurious state when its energy is nearly degenerate with another state in the spectrum ( we will refer to this other state as the `` genuine '' state ) . as the energies approach degeneracy by varying @xmath129 , we observe that the spurious state begins to mix in with the genuine state .",
    "the first evidence for this is that the energy of the genuine state starts to become affected by the presence of the spurious state .",
    "secondly , we see that the radial wavefunctions @xmath137 and @xmath138 of the genuine state begin to acquire non - physical `` bumps '' that oscillate in a way that corresponds to the rapid oscillations of the respective spurious state radial functions . as",
    "the energy becomes nearly degenerate , the two states mix to such a degree that it is not even possible to define one as the `` genuine state '' and the other as the `` spurious state . ''",

    "this is an indication that a spurious state may actually lie at the end of the spectrum for @xmath58 angular symmetries as well .",
    "in fact , we find that setting @xmath129 to a negative value significantly below @xmath159 results in a single spurious state which appears as the lowest energy eigenstate for each @xmath58 . by subsequently increasing @xmath129 from this point",
    ", we may watch as each spurious state is shifted towards the higher energy end of the spectrum , similar to what is observed with @xmath1 spurious states .",
    "now we return briefly to subject of the matrix elements @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the nd basis , which are suspected to contribute to poor representation of orbitals near the nucleus . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dij ] ) and ( [ eq : ndset ] ) we see that these include the integral @xmath160 ^ 2 dr$ ] , which is infinite due to the non - vanishing property of the first b - spline at @xmath20 .",

    "we observe that for the ( @xmath85 , @xmath75 , @xmath136 bohr ) cs set , increasing the numerical value of this integral to 20 times its gaussian quadrature value results in the reappearance of spurious states as the lowest energy eigenstates for each @xmath1 .",
    "simultaneously , the energy of highest energy eigenstate for each @xmath58 is increased substantially .",
    "evidently the capability of @xmath127 to shift the spurious state to the end of the spectrum for @xmath1 angular symmetries is reliant upon the inaccurate numerical evaluation of this ( theoretically ) infinite - value integral .",
    "the claim made in this section of observing spurious states for @xmath58 angular symmetries may seem surprising at first . @xcite have proved that an independent expansion of large and small radial components with a finite set of basis functions leads to a single spurious state for @xmath1 angular symmetries .",
    "this proof assumes the basis functions to vanish at the origin , and the result of this proof is consistent with experience when such basis functions are employed .",
    "arguably , connection is lost immediately with this proof because the nd set includes the first b - spline , which does not vanish at the origin . as we have seen here",
    ", the nd method depends on numerical inaccuracies in evaluating infinite - value integrals in order to manipulate spurious states arising in @xmath1 cases . because the nd method also includes the first b - spline for @xmath58 angular symmetries ( and hence similar numerical inaccuracies )",
    ", we would have no reason to discount the possibility of spurious states from occurring in these cases as well .      in the preceding sections we established that the dkb sets are more robust than the nd bases .",
    "for a comparable size of the basis set the dkb basis exhibits better numerical accuracy for properties accumulated at small radii . or , we may say that for a fixed numerical accuracy , the dkb basis may contain smaller number of basis functions . in this section",
    "we investigate a related question : what the smallest possible basis set is for a given numerical accuracy . keeping the set as small as possible",
    "speeds up many - body calculations that usually require multiple summations over intermediate states . also , smaller basis sets reduce storage requirements for expansion coefficients in all - order techniques such as configuration interaction or coupled - cluster methods .",
    "quantifying the numerical accuracy requires choosing some metric , which characterizes deviation of the selected property for a given basis from its exact value .",
    "apparently , one should select the `` metric '' so that it can be easily computed and is related to the relevant atomic properties . as an example of an optimization measure , here we choose the second - order correction to the energy of a valence electron , @xmath161 .    in the frozen - core dhf approximation",
    "@xmath161 is the leading many - body correction to the energy .",
    "it is given in terms of the coulomb integrals @xmath162 and single particle energies @xmath109 as ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the antisymmetrized coulomb integral .",
    "the summations are carried out over core orbitals ( labels @xmath142 and @xmath144 ) and virtual ( non - core ) orbitals ( labels @xmath165 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "each summation implies summing over principal quantum numbers , angular numbers @xmath4 , and magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "the summation over magnetic quantum numbers may be carried out analytically and we are left with summations over radial functions .",
    "we define a contribution of an individual partial wave @xmath6 , @xmath166 , as the difference @xmath167 , where @xmath168 stands for truncated eq .",
    "( [ eq : e2v ] ) ; it includes summations over intermediate states ( both core and virtual ) with the orbital angular momentum up to @xmath6 .",
    "since the calculations necessarily involve coulomb integrals between orbitals of different angular momenta , the numerical error in @xmath169 is affected by the accuracy of representation of all partial waves up to @xmath6 .",
    "first , in table  [ tab : ensecond ] , we present results for a large set of @xmath126 basis functions for each partial wave .",
    "we use a sufficiently large cavity of @xmath91 bohr in this calculation .",
    "these results will serve as a benchmark for comparisons with the less complete ( optimized ) sets .",
    "we observe that the dominant ( 60% ) contribution comes from @xmath170-waves , @xmath171 .",
    "qualitatively , the second - order energy correction may be described as core - polarization effect .",
    "the outer @xmath172-orbitals of the core are relatively `` soft '' and are easily polarizable .",
    "since the core does not contain @xmath173 and higher partial waves , after peaking at @xmath171 , the partial - wave contributions become suppressed as @xmath6 increases .",
    "qualitatively , this suppression arises due to increased centrifugal repulsion of higher partial waves and associated smaller overlaps with core orbitals in the coulomb integrals of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e2v ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath174 contributes only 0.6% of the total value .",
    "now we would like to minimize the size of the set by choosing a different number of radial basis functions @xmath175 for different angular symmetries @xmath4 . to preserve a numerical balance between the fine - structure components ( for example",
    ", this may be important while recovering non - relativistic limit ) we keep the same number of functions for a given orbital angular momentum @xmath6 , e.g. , @xmath176 .    in table",
    "[ tab : ensecond ] , we present an example of an optimized basis ( marked as `` small set '' ) . we also list resulting numerical errors for each partial wave by comparing @xmath177 with the result from the `` large set '' calculations .",
    "we see that while the basis - set error in higher partial waves is as large as 40% , this hardly makes any influence on the total value of the correlation energy , because of contributions of higher @xmath6 are suppressed .",
    "the total value of the correlation correction differs by about 1% from it s saturated value . considering that the correlation contribution to the energy is about 10% for the @xmath178 state",
    ", the less complete set would introduce only 0.1% error for the total ionization energy .",
    "so far we discussed the correlation energy correction for the @xmath97 state .",
    "the optimized set remains sufficiently robust for other low - lying states as well .",
    "we have carried out a comparison similar to table  [ tab : ensecond ] for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 states . in all these cases the difference between the total @xmath179 values computed with the``large '' and `` small '' sets is about 0.5% . in practical calculations one",
    "is often required to reproduce a number of properties with the same set .",
    "the atomic properties may be quite dissimilar like hyperfine - structure interactions accumulated near the nucleus and dipole matrix elements determined by the valence region .",
    "apparently , one has to carry out a similar low - order mbpt analysis for the relevant quantities to verify the suitability of the optimized set .    from the computational point of view , using the optimized sets speeds up the numerical evaluations . in our illustrative example , the `` large set '' contains @xmath180 orbitals , while the `` small set '' is about four times smaller ( @xmath181 orbitals ) .",
    "the resulting speed - up is sizable : our computations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e2v ] ) for the @xmath97 state ( @xmath174 ) are about 14 times faster with the optimized set , as expected due to @xmath182 scaling of the number of contribution in the most computationally demanding second term of eq.([eq : e2v ] ) .",
    "similar scaling should hold for storage of expansion coefficients in all - order methods , e.g. , for storing triple excitations  @xcite one expects @xmath183 scaling of the storage size .",
