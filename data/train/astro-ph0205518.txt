    "the opening line of walter baade s lectures on the evolution of stars and galaxies @xcite reads : `` the study of the evolution of stars and galaxies is in a stage of rapid development , and we are still at the beginning '' .",
    "almost half a century later the former statement is still timely , as advances in technology have opened new windows for the exploration of galaxy evolution .",
    "the first clue that galaxies change through cosmic time is that galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) appear systematically brighter than those at lower @xmath0 .",
    "we may identify two reasons for this brightening : it could be that either the stellar content was intrinsically brighter at an earlier epoch or that galaxies appear brighter due to the properties of the space - time .",
    "we are fortunate that those issues happened to be the main running themes of this rather interesting conference .",
    "clearly , if we want to understand the brightening of high-@xmath0 galaxies , we need to understand the role of stellar evolution in galaxies as well as the propagation of light in different cosmological models . with these elements in mind let us explore the evolution of galaxy cluster etg and its possible connections with the evolution of field etg .",
    "we note that etg were once considered the simplest stellar systems .",
    "nevertheless , etg , despite their apparently simple appearance , pose some difficult problems to models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable is the inexistence of a comprehensive theory of stellar formation in dynamically hot systems @xcite .",
    "clusters of galaxies provide us with probes to study the effects of the environment on the evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been found that clusters provide a hostile environment for some galaxies ( e.g. , dwarf galaxies : @xcite ; @xcite , and low surface brightness : @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , etg flourish in such rich environments : this is just a paraphrase of the density - morphology relation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the physical parameters of these galaxies , such as colors , size ( e.g. , the effective radius @xmath1 ) , luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 ) , surface brightness ( @xmath4 ) , etc . , have the same pairwise correlations originally found for field etg ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the correlations among these parameters are synthesized by the fundamental plane ( @xmath6 ; fp ; @xcite ) . nevertheless , the effects of the environment may be indicated by an augmented tightness in the correlations for cluster galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this review we present the results of some apparently disconnected evolutionary studies .",
    "we have explored two projections of the fundamental plane .",
    "these studies have led us to conclude that etg in the central regions ( the inner @xmath7 ) is used throughout .",
    "] of rich clusters conform to an old population that has been evolving passively since @xmath8 .",
    "we do not intend to present a comprehensive review ( see elsewhere , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , we do intend to arrive at a unifying view on the evolution of etg .",
    "the work of @xcite was the first study from a series that compared etg in an intermediate-@xmath0 cluster ( cl @xmath9 at @xmath10 , observed with the hst ) with those of a nearby rich cluster ( the coma cluster at z=0.023 , observed with the kpno 0.9 m ) in a bidimensional space that is defined by axes : size versus integrated magnitude .",
    "the size is defined as the core radius in a bidimensional de vacouleurs fit to the surface brightness distribution , and the integrated magnitude was computed by the integration of the best fit . the resulting size - magnitude relation ( smr )",
    "is expected as it conforms one of the projections of the fp @xcite . when the k - corrected smr of coma and cl @xmath9 are compared , an offset of @xmath11 is detected .",
    "this offset indicates that the galaxies in cl @xmath9 are brighter than the ones in coma .",
    "we can explain this result either by assuming that the size remained fixed and the change was due to the evolution of the underlying stellar population ( passive evolution ) or by assuming that both the size and the magnitude were changing due to mergers .",
    "although mergers could have been important at the time of cluster formation @xcite ; the merger hypothesis is not favored because in the central regions of rich clusters the large cluster velocity dispersions ( @xmath12 ) would make merging inefficient .",
    "moreover , the general _ merger rate _",
    "@xcite ] is very low at @xmath13 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the observed changes are due to passive evolution .",
    "similar amount of luminosity evolution was reported by previous observations in clusters around quasars @xcite .",
    "changes in luminosity can easily be explained with the aid of the single burst model ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where a burst of star formation occurs at an epoch @xmath14 .",
    "it can be shown that the expected luminosity evolution is described by a power law @xmath15^{\\kappa}$ ] , with @xmath16>0 $ ] where @xmath17 is the slope of the imf ; it has been found that @xmath18 depends on the metallicity and the passband is provided by mpty universe model ( @xmath19 ) . a simple relation results for the luminosity evolution as a function of @xmath0 : @xmath20^{\\kappa}$ ] , where @xmath21\\,>z$ ] is the galaxy formation redshift . ] .",
    "hence , as @xmath22 becomes larger than @xmath23 the luminosity decreases , in agreement with the expected dimming in luminosity as stars evolve off the giant branch .",
    "further studies @xcite have included more clusters and a larger number of galaxies and have confirmed and extended the early result of @xcite .",
    "figure 1 taken from @xcite summarizes the results from our previous studies .",
    "it is found that @xmath24 , in addition the direct comparison with the models of @xcite has given us a constraint on @xmath25 .",
    "the four most deviant points in this figure are produced by poor sampling .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that our observations are in agreement with models with @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 the salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "the first pairwise relationship discovered among the physical properties of etg was the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "it was originally discovered by @xcite as a trend in which the brightest galaxies are also the reddest . in the same paper @xcite , with",
    "the aid of a simple population synthesis model , demonstrated that etg were dominated by old _",
    "population i _ stars , contrary to the then popular belief that globular clusters and etg had the same stellar make up .",
    "@xcite s observations and their interpretation signified a turning point in our understanding of etg .",
    "the work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that the cmr can be parameterized by a straight line within a luminosity interval of about 8 magnitudes .",
    "this remarkable property suggests that etg from giants to dwarves , with the exception of some brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) , have shared a common history of star formation , even when dwarfs and giants are structurally and dynamically different : a dwarf elliptical galaxy is not a scaled - down giant etg @xcite .",
    "this difference in dynamical behavior is further suggested by the break away of dwarves from the fp and the smr .",
    "the other important property is the universality of the cmr at least for clusters at low redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cmr was first explained by @xcite in terms of the combined effects of dissipative galaxy formation and metallicity .",
    "three constraints on the last epoch of strong galaxy formation in etg can be derived from the study of the cmr .",
    "@xcite showed that the dispersion of the cmr is a good indicator of the age spread in the stellar population , since newer episodes would increase the dispersion about the cmr .",
    "we have found that the dispersion is smaller than the limit of our observations for galaxies in the central regions of clusters at lower redshift ( the locos sample , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second constraint is provided by the absolute color evolution of etg , this can be measured by changes of the zero point of the cmr ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the third constraint is provided by the slope of the cmr : in the classical scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) star formation is regulated by supernova driven winds . in these models",
    "the strongest changes in the stellar population properties occur during the first 5 gyrs after formation . hence if we are able to identify evolution in the slope of the cmr , we could in principle constrain the epoch of the last major starburst .",
    "we have attempted such a test using archive hst observations and locos data @xcite .",
    "the merit of this test is that the slope , being a ratio of colors , is independent of the calibrations and therefore we are provided by an unbiased estimator that can be readily compared with the models .",
    "the comparison of our observed cmr  slopes to a suite of four models with different  formation epochs and  cosmologies is presented in figure 2 .",
    "the overall slope of the red sequence seems to be consistent with passive evolution for all clusters , implying that the populations we have sampled have similar evolutionary histories and time - scales .",
    "the observed slopes of the higher redshift clusters are perfectly consistent with a high formation redshift , and a conservative limit of @xmath28 can be set .",
    "note that up to redshifts of z@xmath290.4 , observations of the slope of the red sequence have little power to distinguish between formation epochs with z@xmath301.0 .",
    "the change in slope at z@xmath310.4 is exclusively due to blue - shifting of the rest - frame band - passes .",
    "however , beyond z@xmath290.5 , the expected slopes for the lowest - formation - epoch models rapidly diverge from the observed slopes .",
    "this turnover is a result of the differing metalicities in the etg population as a function of mass ; at ages younger than @xmath32 5 gyr , the color evolution of the stellar population in a metal - rich etg is significantly different from that of a metal - poorer elliptical @xcite . from figure 2",
    "it is evident that that the slope of the cmr provides a good marker on the last episode of star formation in cluster etg that is almost independent of the cosmology .",
    "the two studies that have been presented here strongly suggest that etg in clusters are evolving passively .",
    "also @xcite and @xcite using the tolman test have shown indirect evidence that also suggest that etg are evolving passively .",
    "we have used the poor - man s approach to the fp in order to address the evolution of etg .",
    "can we expect to detect the same kind of evolution using the fp itself ?",
    "the answer is yes : there are many fp studies for cluster galaxies at low and intermediate @xmath0 that have agreed that etg are evolving passively ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 also reveals that the best agreement between the models and the observations is reached with a salpeter imf .",
    "this is remarkable since @xcite defined the imf for the solar neighborhood .",
    "field etg at higher redshifts also reveal a salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "star formation being such a complex physical process has all the characteristic of self - organized criticality ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "our results along with those of @xcite further supports the universality of the imf .    our general conclusion , which also agrees with many other studies ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is that cluster etg coevally formed at @xmath33 and have been evolving passively since then . moreover , a single burst with a salpeter imf suffices to explain the observations presented in this review ."
