    "the concept of the photon originated in 1900 in the description of the black body radiation when m. planck assumed that the emission and the absorption of energy should appear in the form of quanta of energy .",
    "the einstein suggestion presented in 1905 , that light be considered a collection of independent particles of energy , or particles of light , was not easily accepted nor by planck nor by other physicists .",
    "r. a. millikan , experimentalist working on the photo - emission from metal surfaces , _ even in the face of his own data ( supporting einstein s view ) called it a `` bold , not to say reckless , hypothesis''_. for twenty years also bohr resisted the concept of light quanta , _ he , again like planck , argued that the locus of the problem was not light , but matter _ ( from [ 1a ] ) . in 1922 a convincing evidence for light quanta appeared in the scattering of x rays on electrons ( a. compton s experiment ) .",
    "the current name : the photon was given by the american chemist g. n. lewis in 1926 .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the theory describing the interaction between electrons and photons , was introduced later on ( years 1925 - 1927 by m. born , w. heisenberg , p. jordan and p. dirac [ 1b , c ] ) ; the photon plays here the role of a gauge boson , mediating the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "it is assumed to be a massless and chargeless object with a pointlike coupling to elementary , charged particles .",
    "its role is not changed in the standard model .",
    "no doubt , it is the oldest and the best known boson .      _ in quantum field theory , the electromagnetic field couples to all particles carrying the electromagnetic current , and thus a photon can fluctuate into virtual states of remarkable complexity . at high energies ,",
    "the fluctuation of a photon into a fock state of particles of total invariant mass @xmath0 can persist over a time of order @xmath1 - untill the virtual state is materialized by a collision or annihilation with another system _ , from ref . [ 3 g ] .    _ at first",
    ", the photon was regarded as structureless ... as the scale of available energies increased , it was found that through an interaction with a coulomb field the photon could materialize as pairs of electrons e^+e^- .",
    "although not usually thought of in these terms , this phenomenon was the earliest manifestation of photon structure .",
    "so , one can say that    _ _    the physical photon has an electron - positron pair constituent .    ...",
    "the photon ( real or virtual ) was for purpose of hadronic interactions again regarded as structureless, ... in reality the photon has an internal structure which is very similar to that of hadrons , except that it occurs with a probability only of order @xmath2 ,    from [ 2b ] .",
    "the hadronic properties of the photon were observed first in soft processes like @xmath3 or @xmath4 , where the typical for pure hadronic elastic processes falloff with the square of the momentum transfer @xmath5 was present .",
    "such _ soft _",
    "hadronic processes involving photons can be described in the so called vector dominance model(vdm ) , assuming the `` @xmath6- meson component '' in the photon ( also @xmath7 and @xmath8 components , or other vector mesons resonances in the generalized vdm ( gvdm ) ) .",
    "as @xmath9 increases it is very unlikely that the process remains elastic .",
    "the inelastic production starts to dominate , nevertheless one can still find in the photon - hadron scattering a similarity to the pure hadron - hadron collision . in both cases , for example , in the _ hard _ inclusive processes , the quark and gluon degrees of freedom come into the game .",
    "this is expected since by similar reasoning as above , the transition q |q , which may occur in a color field of hadronic constituents , ] should be treated as a signal of the quark constituent in the photon .",
    "the discussed above vector meson components of the photon arises when the @xmath10 system is confined .",
    "hard hadronic processes involving partonic constituents of the photon can be described in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) due to smallness of the corresponding coupling constant @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the hard scale .",
    "presently such results exist up to next - to - leading @xmath13 terms ( nll ) .",
    "contrary to the structure of hadrons , the structure functions for the photon can be calculated in the parton model and already at this ( born ) level the scaling violation appears .",
    "the all - order logarithmic @xmath12 dependence of the partonic densities in the photon can in principle be calculated in qcd in a form of the asymptotic solutions , without the extra input at some scale , needed for hadrons .",
    "a singular behaviour is obtained in the nll calculation of the asymptotic solution at small @xmath14 , to be regularised by the nonperturbative ( @xmath6 ) contribution .",
    "the structure function of a _ virtual photon _",
    ", with virtuality @xmath15 in the region where @xmath16 , is free from a such singular behaviour at small @xmath14",
    ". therefore the measurement of the structure of virtual photon plays a special role as a unique test of perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "similarly to the photon case , one can introduce the partonic `` structure '' of @xmath17 bosons @xcite or leptons @xcite .",
    "note , that the structure of the virtual photon and the structure of the electron are closely related to each other in the @xmath18 or @xmath19 collisions .",
    "this new area for theoretical investigations has been opened in the last few years , leading to interesting results .    in @xmath18 collisions",
    "the dedicated dis@xmath20 experiments are performed in order to measure the photon structure functions . here",
    "the photon - probe with the high virtuality tests the partonic structure of the photonic target .",
    "the large @xmath21 particle or jet production in @xmath18 and @xmath19 collisions ( so called resolved photon processes ) are suitable for this purpose as well , see .",
    "the existing data allow to construct the parton parametrizations for both real and the virtual photon using the appropriate for the photon evolution equations ( inhomogeneous ones , due to the direct coupling to quarks ( eq.2 ) ) .",
    "so far only the parametrizations for unpolarized parton densities are available ( the review of parton parametrizations can be found in @xcite ) .      during the last few years",
    "a significant progress has been made in measurements of the structure function @xmath22 and of the individual parton distributions in the resolved photon processes due to lep and kek @xmath18 experiments , as well as due to photoproduction measurements at the @xmath19 collider hera ( recent results are discussed in @xcite ) .    in the single tagged @xmath18 experiments with an arbitrary hadronic final state",
    "the structure function @xmath22 is measured in the @xmath12 range between 0.24 and 390 gev@xmath23 and @xmath14 from 0.002 to 0.98 . although the general behaviour of @xmath22 both as a function of the @xmath12 and @xmath14 agrees with the theoretical predictions , the situation is not satisfactory .",
    "the uncertainties of the data are large because of still small statistics , and because of difficulties with the unfolding of the true variables from the visible ones ( as for example visible invariant mass of the hadronic system @xmath24 instead of the full @xmath25 needed to extract the quantity @xmath14 ) .",
    "note also , that serious discrepancies were found recently in the description by the existing mc generators of some details of the final hadronic systems in the dis@xmath20 experiments and also in the jet production in resolved photon processes , both in @xmath26 collisions at lep and in the @xmath27 collisions at hera .",
    "following the line of reasoning from sec.1.2 we discuss now the structure functions of the photon . the cross section for the process involving the interaction of the photon with elementary ,",
    "charged particles can be presented symbolically as a series in the coupling constant @xmath28 : ~+^2+  for small coupling constant , one can approximate the cross section by the first , or by first few terms in the above expansion .",
    "however for some inclusive processes involving a large energy scale , the expansion parameter may be different - there may appear large logarithms which should then be summed up to all orders .",
    "let us discuss the inclusive , pure electromagnetic process where the true expansion parameter is instead of @xmath30 rather @xmath31 ( the leading logarithms ( ll ) expansion ) , and the cascade process starting from the initial photon ( eq.1 ) may be factorized ( separated ) from the basic hard subprocess which occurs at a scale @xmath12",
    ".    we will study the following process , where a muon pair with a large invariant mass is produced together with an arbitrary electromagnetic state @xmath32 : e^+ ^+ ^- x  (  leptons   and  photons ) . the leading order ( lo ) cross section for process ( 4 ) is given by : _",
    "e^+^+ ^- x(s , m^2)=dx _",
    "f_e/(x_,q^2 ) _ e^+e^-^+ ^-(m^2 ) .",
    "the function @xmath33 describes the probability ( within the ll accuracy in the lo approach ) to find in the initial photon an electron with a fraction of momentum @xmath34 , at the scale @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath35 is here the lowest order cross section for the muon pair production ( @xmath36 ) with large invariant mass @xmath37 , which serves here as the scale for the large logarithms , @xmath12=@xmath37 .",
    "the electromagnetic structure functions of the photon related to the introduced above function @xmath38 are being measured presently in the following deep inelastic scattering on photon ( dis@xmath20 ) : e(k ) ( p ) e(k ) x  (  leptons ) , at a scale @xmath39 , usually greater that 1 @xmath40 .",
    "arises since the discussed measurement is in practice correlated to the one , where the qcd structure functions is probed ( see below for details ) ]    in the single tagged events at @xmath18 colliders the initial ( target ) photon is almost real , @xmath41 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "-0.3in1.05 in 0.4 cm    to describe the dis@xmath20 process ( 6 ) the following variables are being used : x_bj = q^2 , y = pq .",
    "( note that in the lo approach @xmath42 ) .",
    "the differential cross section for process ( 6 ) , for unpolarized initial particles , is given by the following qed or leptonic structure functions : = 4 ^ 22pk [ ( 1-y)f_2^(qed)(x_bj , q^2)+x_bjy^2 f_1^(qed)(x_bj , q^2 ) ] .",
    "note that the function @xmath43(equal to the transverse @xmath44 ) or the longitudinal function @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) are not easily accessible , due to the small @xmath47 range probed in present experiments .",
    "some of the recent data for the @xmath48 , obtained for the muonic final state , are presented in fig .",
    "2 together with the qed prediction , based on the first order process : @xmath49 ( other structure functions ( azimuthal correlations ) , which arise when final state particles are observed were measured as well , see discussion in @xcite . )    -0.2in-1.705 in 3.505 in 0.4 cm    the important additional results from these measurements is the estimation of the averaged virtuality of the initial photon needed for the extraction of hadronic structure functions , see below .",
    "let us assume now that in the first step the photon decays with probability @xmath30 into a pair of quark antiquark ( eq.2 ) .",
    "then the subsequent radiation processes will be rather governed by the strong coupling constant @xmath50 than by the electromagnetic one . for the inclusive production of hadrons",
    "the true expansion parameter is expected to be @xmath51 , with the @xmath12 scale parameter being , in order to apply the perturbative qcd , larger than @xmath52 .",
    "then the cascade process originated from the initial photon can be described in the perturbative qcd in terms of the parton distribution in the photon .",
    "the analogue of the process ( 4 ) may be now the process : ^+ ^- x ( hadrons ) , with the lo formula for the cross section _",

    "when in the final state only hadrons are produced in the dis@xmath20 experiment at @xmath18 colliders , the ( hadronic ) structure functions of the photon @xmath54 related to @xmath55 are measured . since only part of the final hadronic state",
    "is observed in practice , the proper estimation of @xmath56 and also the proper unfolding of the true variables , @xmath57 , is crucial .",
