    "the physical implementation of quantum computation is thought of as a fundamental step for quantum information processing @xcite . in recent years , some proposals have been offered about the realization of quantum computation , using atoms or photons in cavity @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and bulk nmr techniques @xcite . in the implementation of these quantum computation architectures",
    ", it seems very difficult to perform the actual large - scale quantum computation .",
    "however , the quantum solid - state computation now attracts a considerable interest because of the feasible manipulation of many qubits represented by superconducting cooper pairs @xcite , electron spin in quantum dots @xcite , orbital energy levels in nanostructures @xcite , donor nuclear spins @xcite and newly defined pseudospins @xcite . in principle , the amazing large - scale quantum computation can be realized in such quantum solid - state systems .",
    "the schemes based on quantum dots have unique advantages in the actual physical implementation . in quantum dots ,",
    "the microscopic systems of two discrete levels can serve as a qubit carrying the elementary quantum information .",
    "the electron spin as a natural two - level quantum system can be considered as one good qubit with the long coherence time @xcite .",
    "the pseudospin using the orbit degrees of freedom is another one which can be controlled easily @xcite .",
    "more recently , the proposal by combining the spin and orbit degrees of freedom has been introduced @xcite .",
    "based on it , coherently controlling single electron spin is possible .",
    "it seems that both good qualities about the long coherence time and easy manipulation are shown by this newly defined quantum system .",
    "regardless of the definition of qubit , most of effective interaction between two coupled qubits are modeled by the heisenberg exchange interaction .",
    "it has been shown that the universal quantum gates @xcite can be realized via the isotropic heisenberg interaction and the uniform magnetic field @xcite . in the realistic spin - based quantum computation ,",
    "errors from inhomogeneous zeeman field @xcite and anisotropic interactions @xcite are regarded as a major obstacle in quantum dots .",
    "the errors from inhomogeneous field can not be eliminated completely @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the anisotropy induced by the spin - orbit coupling can lead to the nontrivial error with the order of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to study the method of implementing the quantum computation in the anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "the construction of correct swap action is one crucial step for possible quantum computation .    in this paper",
    ", the correct swap action can be performed in the anisotropic heisenberg @xmath1 model . in section",
    "ii , the conditions of performing correct swap action are analyzed in detail .",
    "the impacts of the certain fluctuations on swap action are estimated by the gate fidelity from the heisenberg interaction , the anisotropy and the effective zeeman field . in section iii ,",
    "the possible physical implementation of such swap action is presented .",
    "a discussion concludes the paper .",
    "in mangy protocols about the solid - state quantum computation , the isotropic heisenberg model is always uesd because the universal quantum gates can be constructed in this ideal model",
    ". nevertheless , in realistic quantum computers , there are always anisotropic exchange interactions .",
    "therefore , the general case of anisotropic heisenberg @xmath1 model needs to be studied .",
    "the hamiltonian of two coupled qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be given as @xmath4 where @xmath5 are three components of qubit @xmath2 operator and @xmath6 is the pauli operator .",
    "for the convenience of computation , @xmath7 are assumed to be the eigenstates of @xmath8 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the effective strength of heisenberg exchange interaction and @xmath11 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "if the external magnetic field @xmath12 is along @xmath13 direction , @xmath14 is the effective zeeman splitting energy with @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the effective @xmath16 factor and @xmath17 is the bohr magneton . for the possible realization of quantum computation",
    ", the parameters @xmath18 , and @xmath14 can be tunable in quantum computers .    to show the dynamics of the anisotropic heisenberg @xmath1 model , the eigenstates @xmath19 and corresponding eigenvalues @xmath20 of @xmath21 need to be derived . in this model , the total spin",

    "the swap action is just one of the unitary operations @xmath27 by which the states at qubit @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be exchanged . without losing of the generality , an initial arbitrary quantum product state of qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be assumed to be @xmath28 are arbitrary complex coefficients which satisfy @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the process of time evolution ,",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath31 and @xmath32 are generally turned into the mixed ones , i. e. , @xmath33 , which is useless for the setup of the swap action . only if the density matrix @xmath34 can be expressed by the product of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "it can be used to construct the swap action .",
    "the method is very crucial by which the pure state @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be determined at a certain time .",
    "to obtain the swap action , the theorem about an arbitrary @xmath35 matrix @xmath36 is introduced by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the trace norm of matrix @xmath36 , @xmath39 is the determinant of @xmath36 and @xmath40 is the unity matrix .",
    "if @xmath36 is a pure state , the determinant satisfies @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath54 , the condition of @xmath55 needs the phase angles which simultaneously satisfy @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "that is , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , when the value of @xmath62 is even at certain time @xmath63 , the state of qubit @xmath2 can be expressed by @xmath64|1\\rangle_i$ ] with the additional phase to the original state @xmath65 . when the value of @xmath62 is odd at another certain time @xmath66 ,",

    "the correct swap action can be performed at this moment .",
    "similarly , @xmath70 at @xmath71 and the state of qubit @xmath2 keeps invariant . in some solid - state quantum computation architecture",
    ", the anisotropy @xmath11 can be adjusted by the time independent parameter .",
    "thus , a correct swap action @xmath27 will be set up if the conditions are satisfied by @xmath72 by combining the corresponding single qubit operations and the swap action , the other two - qubit gate like cnot gate will be easily constructed @xcite .    in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "al . discussed the heisenberg @xmath1 model for quantum swap action . by means of the time evolution of one single - qubit reduced density matrix",
    ", they found that the heisenberg xxz model of @xmath73 can not be used to perform the exact swap action .",
    "however , the anisotropy @xmath74 needs to be included in the general heisenberg @xmath1 model .",
    "different from the result of @xcite , the general solution of a swap action is obtained by eq .",
    "( 4 ) when the anisotropy is @xmath74 . from eq . ( 9 ) , it is clear that the anisotropy of @xmath73 can not be used to perform a swap action .",
    "this is consistent with the previous work @xcite .",
    "apart from the case of eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the swap errors can not be neglected . in realistic quantum computation ,",
    "certain fluctuations @xcite from internal and external impacts are unavoidable",
    ". for quantum gates , the fluctuations from @xmath75 and @xmath76 will influence the performance of @xmath27 . for the weak coupling ,",
    "the gaussian distributions of @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be reasonably assumed .",
    "the gaussian distribution @xmath79 with the mean value @xmath80 and the standard deviation @xmath81 .",
    "these fluctuations are possible attributable to those of exchange interaction @xmath10 , anisotropy @xmath11 and the effective zeeman field @xmath14 .",
    "to evaluate the effects of such fluctuations on @xmath27 , the gate fidelity @xcite can be introduced as @xmath82 where the overline denotes the average for all the possible initial states . after the calculation ,",
    "the general fidelity is expressed by @xmath83 when the mean value of the distributions is chosen to be those given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the average fidelity @xmath84 with fluctuations is obtained by @xmath85 it is seen that the fluctuation from @xmath86 mainly determined by the heisenberg interaction @xmath10 is always dominate in contrast to others .",
    "if the deviations @xmath87 , the limit of the average fidelity is @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "1 , the condition of @xmath89 is clearly shown .",
    "the gate fidelity is decreased more rapidly with @xmath90 than that with @xmath91 .",
    "from one kind of newly defined pseudospin @xcite , the implementation of quantum computation can be possibly performed via the controllable anisotropic heisenberg model in quantum dots . as an effective qubit",
    ", this pseudospin can be constructed in a @xmath13-directional quantum dot .",
    "the either end of the quantum dot is applied by a ferromagnetic gate electrodes that creates a magnetic field gradient @xmath92 along @xmath93 axis .",
    "if another external magnetic field @xmath94 is applied along @xmath13 axis , the total slanting magnetic field is @xmath95 .",
    "it is noticed that the slanting magnetic field is static and tunable .",
    "the hamiltonian of single electron in the parabolic confinement potential like @xmath96 can be expressed by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the effective mass , @xmath99 is the frequency of the potential . the last term at the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 12 ) is the zeeman splitting energy from the slanting magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath12 is quite large that the effect of the zeeman splitting energy can not be neglected . if @xmath100 , the effective two - level quantum system can be formed at the ground state . in general , the amplitude of field gradient @xmath92 is smaller than that of external field @xmath94 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to apply the perturbation method to the splitting of @xmath101 . for the convenience ,",
    "the length of the confinement potential is chosen as @xmath102 . in the product space of spin and orbit degree of freedom @xmath103",
    ", the ground - state energy @xmath104 can be given by the second order approximation , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the zeroth order energy and @xmath107 .",
    "simultaneously , the ground state is calculated by the first order approximation , latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq14 }    coefficient for pseudospin @xmath2 is @xmath109 .",
    "the two - level states of this pseudospin are described by @xmath110 with the corresponding splitting energy @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the effective hamiltonian for this pseudospin @xmath2 can be written as @xmath112 where the transition frequency @xmath113 .",
    "based on this pseudospin , two coupled quantum dots @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be constructed in series @xcite . after the introduction of the tunneling and inter - dot interaction , the effective hamiltonian @xmath114 mapped into the qubits is obtained by @xcite @xmath115",
    "where the effective interaction @xmath116 , the effective anisotropy @xmath117}$ ] and the effective zeeman splitting @xmath118 $ ] with @xmath119 .",
    "it is noted that the inhomogeneity from @xmath120 and @xmath121 is considered .",
    "the parameter @xmath122 is the charge energy , @xmath123 is the strength of the inter - dot interaction , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the tunneling terms .",
