    "this phenomenon , which is called _ entanglement _ and has no analogoue in classical theory , grossly violates the locality principle , as was first highlighted by einstein , podolski and rosen in @xcite .",
    "purpose of the authors was to demonstrate that the existence of entanglement is incompatible with the completeness of quantum theory , but their thesis was proved to be wrong in many occasions over time , first of all by john s. bell in his 1964 article `` _ _ on the einstein - poldolsky - rosen paradox _ _ '' @xcite .",
    "bell showed that any theory reproducing the predictions of quantum mechanics has to violate locality .",
    "quantum theory is thus a complete non - local theory , with entanglement as an inevitable consequence of its principles .",
    "the article by epr , against the scopes of the authors , laid the bases for the birth of quantum information theory , the purpose of which is to study the nature of entanglement and the way to exploit it .",
    "let us consider a state in a composite quantum system .",
    "it may seem reasonable to suppose that this state has a certain fixed amount of entanglement , or in other words , the system has a fixed amount of quantum correlation within .",
    "however , it has been proven , as we are going to explain in more detail in the present work , that the quantity and even the existence of entanglement for a certain state depends on the choice of the factorization of the algebra of observables , i.e.  on the choice of the physical observables used to describe it . as an example , a composite system consisting of a couple of spins could be described in terms of total spin , and in this factorization no entanglement will appear : the system would not even look `` composite '' .",
    "the possibility for entanglement to be `` created '' and `` destroyed '' is maybe its most fascinating feature , and is the basis for many of the recent achievements in quantum information and quantum computing , such as the protocols of quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation , or the superdense coding .",
    "the questions `` when '' and `` how '' it is possible to manipulate entanglement are thus of main importance .    the first part of the present work will be devoted to a summary of the necessary basic concepts to deal with quantum mechanics and , in particular , with quantum information theory , such as the hilbert space , the tensor product space , the density operator , and so on .",
    "+ then , in * chapter [ chap2 ] * , we will start the central part of our exposition , treating the case of pure states ; it will be shown how it is always possible to make any pure state appear either entangled or not ( in the latter case we talk of _ separable _ or _ factorized _ states ) .",
    "+ the possibility for a state to be described in terms of a wavefunction is strictly connected with the possibility to make it appear entangled ( or not ) . in * chapter [ chap3 ] * we will thus consider the more general case of mixed states , and we will see that the situation here is more complex : we will demonstrate that it is still always possible to represent any state as separable , but we will also see examples of _ absolutely separable _ states , i.e.  states which appear separable in every factorization ; even if it is not always possible to make a mixed state appear entangled , we will introduce two classes of states for which this possibility exists .",
    "the chapter will be closed by two complements , a basic exposition of the protocol of quantum teleportation , and a description of the geometry of physical states for the case of two qubits , i.e.  for @xmath0 dimensional composite system . + we will then draw our conclusions , briefly summarizing the results here exposed .",
    "the present work includes , in its last pages , a short list of references to the literature .",
    "a _ hilbert space _ is a vector space , real or complex , where an inner product is defined and which is a complete metric space with respect to the norm induced by this inner product .",
    "a hilbert space is called _ separable _ if it admits a countable complete orthonormal basis set .    in quantum mechanics a physical system",
    "is associated with a separable hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "the state of the system is represented by a ray in @xmath1 . using the dirac notation we will denote a vector in @xmath1 by @xmath2 and its dual by @xmath3 .",
    "correspondingly , given any two vectors @xmath2 and @xmath4 , their inner product and the associated norm will be respectively denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "since , for any complex @xmath7 , the two vectors @xmath2 and @xmath8 correspond to the same state , we can always represent a state by a vector with unit norm ( and so we ll do , except where otherwise specified ) .",
    "given a complete set of vectors @xmath9 , the existence of which is granted by the separability , we can expand any other vector @xmath2 as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the projection of @xmath2 along @xmath12 .",
    "the completeness of the set @xmath12 is expressed by the _ closure relation _",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the identity operator .",
    "another useful property that we can require of the set of basis states is orthonormality : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kronecker delta .      within this representation , a physical observable",
    "is represented by a hermitian operator ( say @xmath17 ) which has a complete set of eigenvectors ( _ eigenstates _ ) .",
    "if the system is in an eigenstate of @xmath17 ( say @xmath12 ) , then the result of a measurement of the observable is certain : it corresponds to the eigenvalue of @xmath17 associated with @xmath12 , i.e. : @xmath18    for a generic state @xmath2 it is not possible to make a certain prediction of the outcome of a measurement .",
    "instead , we can define an _ expectation value _ of @xmath17 on @xmath2 as @xmath19 which is the statistical mean value of the operator on the state .",
    "an operator acting on a separable space can be represented as a matrix .",
    "its matrix elements with respect to an assumed complete basis are given by : @xmath20      let us consider a system which is composed of a number @xmath21 of subsystems . since , under certain circumstances , every subsystem can be studied separately , it must be represented by a hilbert space . in our representation , then , the relation between the total system and the subsystems can be simply expressed in terms of a tensor product : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath1 denote the space of the @xmath24-th subsystem and the total system , respectively .",
    "are just labels , not necessarily numbers . ]",
    "thus , @xmath1 is said to have a _",
    "tensor product structure_(tps ) .    given a vector @xmath25 for each of the subsystems , we can build a vector of the total system : @xmath26 for an easier reading we can use the notation @xmath27 or , when no confusion is possible , the even more compact @xmath28 .",
    "notice that not every vector in @xmath1 can be written in this _ factorized form _ ; in quantum physics factorizability has a precise meaning , corresponding to the possibility that a state is completely described in terms of the states of the subsystems , which is , of course , not always possible .",
    "we shall discuss related issues further in due course .",
    "given the sets of basis states @xmath29 for the subsystems `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' , etc .",
    ", it is then trival to demonstrate that @xmath30 forms a basis for @xmath1 .",
    "we can see that the dimension @xmath31 of @xmath1 is given by the product of the dimensions @xmath32 of its subspaces : @xmath33 orthonormality is preserved : @xmath34      an operator on @xmath39 , for example , can be extended to the entire @xmath1 by just setting it equal to the identity with respect to the other subspaces : @xmath40 the eigenspaces of the extended operator are formed by all those vectors whose projection on @xmath39 is an eigenvector for @xmath41 ; for every eigenvector of @xmath41 we now have @xmath31 independent eigenvectors of @xmath42 , where @xmath31 is the dimension of @xmath43 ( eventually a countable infinity ) , with the same eigenvalue : the spectrum of the eigenvalues does not change but the degeneracy is multiplied by @xmath31 .    generally speaking , we can combine @xmath21 operators acting on the subspaces in one operator acting on @xmath1 .",
    "we use the tensor product structure as for the vectors : @xmath44 and , as for the vectors , we point out that not every operator can be written in the factorized form ( [ facop ] ) . because of the linearity of the various @xmath45 , tensor product operators act on a generic @xmath46 in the folllowing way : @xmath47 so that if the state is factorized the expression simplifies to become @xmath48      sometimes is not possible to give a complete description of a quantum system .",
    "that may happen :    * because we have access only to a part of the system , for example , when we can not observe all the products of a decay process , so that a complete description is _ actually impossible _ ; * because the system is too wide or complicated , as a macroscopic system , making a complete description _ practically impossible _ ; * because we are only interested in one part of the system : a complete description is _",
    "unwanted_.    to begin the discussion with the simplest cases of a _ bi - partite system _ , consisting of subsystems @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we imagine to divide the total hilbert space @xmath1 into two subspaces : @xmath51 , to which we do have access , and @xmath52 , to which we do not .  , we assume in the following that its hilbert space @xmath52 is separable",
    "] however , in general , the state of the composite system can not be factorized in the form @xmath53 , i.e. , we can not describe completely the subsystem @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) alone .",
    "nevertheless , we are interested to evaluate , for example , the expectation values of the observables acting on @xmath51 using the information we have .",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath54 , as defined in ( [ expect ] ) , recalling also ( [ psi ] ) , is : @xmath55 we have used the closure relation @xmath56 in the second line and , in the third , the equality @xmath57 due to the fact that @xmath17 acts only on @xmath51 .",
    "here it is appropriate to introduce the _ density operator _ : @xmath58 i.e. , by its matrix elements ; this may require additional considerations if non - separable spaces are admitted , which we presently do not pursue , for simplicity . with this powerful tool",
    "the above expectation value of observable @xmath17 can be expressed in the very elegant way @xmath59 where the trace is over all states of the composite system .",
    "the density operator has the following three properties :    1 .",
    "normalized : @xmath60 ; 2 .",
    "hermitian : @xmath61 ; 3 .   positive semi - definite : @xmath62 .  , which implies the positive - semidefiniteness .",
    "]    the demonstrations are trivial , given the explicit form of @xmath63 above .",
    "in general , these properties are considered to _ define _ a density operator .",
    "consider a bipartite system @xmath64 and the two bases @xmath65 for @xmath51 and @xmath66 for @xmath52 .",
    "first , let us define the _ reduced density operator _ for a subsystem , which is given by the partial trace of @xmath63 over the other subsystems ; for example , in this case we have @xmath67    the most general state @xmath68 for the system @xmath1 and the associated density operator are : @xmath69    the reduced density operators for the subsystems are : @xmath70    we can choose , for the @xmath65 , an orthonormal set of eigenvectors for @xmath71 . then , defining _",
    "schmidt coefficients _ @xmath72 ( eigenvalues of @xmath71 ) , from ( [ reduced ] ) we have : @xmath73 we can also introduce the normalized vectors @xmath74 , which allow us to write : @xmath75 so we see that the @xmath76 are eigenvectors for @xmath77 : the two reduced density operators are simultaneously diagonal and they have the same eigenvalues @xmath78 .",
    "the procedure used above is called _ schmidt decomposition _ and allows us to express a pure state and its density operator in terms of a sum over one index only .",
    "the sum is limited by the dimension of the smallest of the subspaces , in fact we have implicitly assumed @xmath79 .",
    "when a state is expressed in its schmidt form , it is straightforward to determine if it is factorized or not : if only one schmidt coefficient is nonvanishing , the state is factorized ; otherwise it is _ entangled _ ( not factorized ) .",
    "those @xmath80 appearing ( with their complex conjugates ) in ( [ rho ] ) are nothing but the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath37 with respect to the basis states of the form @xmath81 .",
    "if the state is factorized , @xmath82 , the coefficients depend on only one subspace each .",
    "then , defining @xmath83 , @xmath84 , we obtain from ( [ rho ] ) : @xmath85 because , even if we do not know the @xmath86 , the closure relation still holds for the basis @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , we can choose a complete set for @xmath51 including @xmath88 to obtain @xmath63 in diagonal form : @xmath89 if we know the wavefunction @xmath88 , which represents the state of the subsystem to which we have access , i.e. , if the state of the total system @xmath1 is factorized in terms of states of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we can say our information is complete , since the uncertainty , if any , about the outcome of measurements on @xmath49 does not depend on our ignorance .    to identify these states , which we call _ pure states _ , we introduce the following important property of the density operator : @xmath90 that is , the density operator corresponding to a pure state is a _ projector _ ; in particular , we have @xmath91 in the present case .",
    "we call _ mixed state _ a generic state which , generally , may not be factorizable .   in the latter case , we do not have a wavefunction on @xmath51 and the system can not be described but in terms of the density operator .",
    "a situation of particular interest occurs when our missing information is due to the statistical nature of the system .",
    "let @xmath92 be a set of possible states for our system .",
    "suppose we know the probability @xmath93 for the system to be in the @xmath24-th state .",
    "if @xmath94 is a complete set , we can write : @xmath95 for the expectation value of an observable we have : @xmath96 now the density operator assumes the form : @xmath97 thus , @xmath63 is the weighted ( by @xmath93 ) mean value of the @xmath63 of the single states @xmath98 . since @xmath99 is a complete set , we can represent the density matrix with respect to it in diagonal form : @xmath100      a _ qubit _ is a two - states quantum system .",
    "it is the minimal unit of quantum information .",
    "typical realizations are an atom with its ground state and one of its excited states , a photon with its two polarization states ( for fixed frequency and direction ) or an electronic spin with its `` up '' and `` down '' states .",
    "a commonly used basis for qubit representation is the _",
    "pauli basis _ : @xmath101    among all possible bipartite systems , two - qubit systems are of particular importance for their facility to be treated theoretically and experimentally .",
    "to represent two qubits we shall often use the _ bell basis _ : @xmath102 the states composing a bell basis have the peculiarity of being maximally entangled ; since entanglement is , as we shall see , a factorization - dependent property , it is understood that a bell state remains entangled as long as we do not change the choice of the decomposition for the total system .",
    "we shall now clarify what we mean with _",
    "maximal entanglement_. a varitey of measures have been introduced to quantify the amount of entanglement , mostly based on the shannon or von neumann entropy , applied to a density matrix ; the interested reader will find more in ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.1.3 ) or , for the two - qubit case , in @xcite . here",
    "we shall just notice that the entanglement measure ( _ entanglement of formation _ ) most commonly used in the literature is a quantity bounded below and above , so maximal entanglement is a well defined concept for a fixed factorization .",
    "following the presentation in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have introduced the density operator in a theoretical and general approach .",
    "we have also defined pure and mixed states in relation to the possibility to factorize them in a certain representation of a composite system .   whether this possibility of factorization exists or not is not completely dictated by the `` book of nature '' , since factorizability is a matter of choice of the representation , as we shall see in more detail .",
    "but , given a state , its purity does not depend on the set of eigenvectors chosen to span the space , i.e.  on the choice of the observables , since the property @xmath103 still holds under basis changes .    in the next chapter the concept of entanglement will be introduced . some results from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite about the possibility of finding and creating entanglement for the case of pure states will be exposed .",
    "let us consider a bipartite system @xmath104 ( the generalization to any multipartite system is trivial ) .",
    "each subsystem will be equipped with an algebra of observables , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and the total algebra will be given by @xmath107 .",
    "_ local _ observables are those elements of the total algebra that can be expressed in the form @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 ) , i.e.  the observables only acting on one subsystem .",
    "entanglement is generally defined as quantum correlation between non - local observables , but it can also be expressed in terms of correlation between systems , as we shall see immediately .",
    "the state , pure or mixed , of each subsystem is described by its density matrix @xmath71 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the state of the total system is the tensor product of the two subsystem states _ if and only if _ there is neither statistical ( classical ) nor quantum correlation : @xmath110 if ( and only if ) non local q - correlation is absent , the state of the total system can be written as a mixture of uncorrelated states , and the state is separable .",
    "we can then define :    a state @xmath111 of a bipartite system @xmath104 is _ separable _ if and only if it can be written in the form : @xmath112 where the @xmath113 are classical probabilities , i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "otherwise , when the state can not be written in this form , the subsystems are said to be _",
    "entangled_.     this definition can be easily generalized to multipartite systems .",
    "entanglement corresponds to q - correlation between non - local systems .      in the previous section",
    "we have defined entanglement as a property for a quantum system connected with the notion of non - locality .",
    "locality is only defined with respect to a tps within the space that represents the system . in turn",
    ", a tps is induced by the algebra of observables , so our next goal will be to provide sufficient criteria for the algebra of a finite - dimensional system to induce a tps .    as an example , consider a generic pure state @xmath115 , where @xmath1 is an _ unstructured _",

    "<S> some possible constraints under wich a quantum state can be represented as entangled are discussed :    * for pure states no further restrictions are necessary and we will summarize the relevant results reported in the literature recently . in short , depending on the choice of observables , a pure quantum state of a composite system can be demonstrated to be either entangled or separable . in this sense , entanglement is not an invariant property of a given state , despite its fundamental role concerning properties of multi - partite systems ( such as in the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen considerations ) . * for mixed states </S>",

    "<S> indeed , it is always possible to choose a factorization such that a state appears separable , as we shall demonstrate . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not known in general how much `` mixedness '' is admissible , such that a state can still be represented as entangled . </S>",
    "<S> this will be investigated in more detail in our work .    </S>",
    "<S> the general statements at which we arrive will be applied to some illustrative examples and to the well known phenomenon of quantum teleportation , an entanglement feature of great interest in quantum information theory . </S>",
    "<S> we will also describe and discuss the geometry of quantum physical states for the case of two qubits .    </S>",

    "<S> thus , entanglement ( or , to the contrary , separability ) of a given quantum state is not uniquely determined by properties of the state , but may depend on the choice of the factorization of the algebra of observables . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we expose and systematize some recently reported results about the possibility to represent a single quantum state as either entangled or separable . </S>",
