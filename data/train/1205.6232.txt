    "first of all , for large values of @xmath7 proper rewsb encounters serious difficulties .",
    "let us explain this point below . at large @xmath7",
    ", proper rewsb implies that parameter @xmath0 is given by : @xmath8 while the mass squared of the cp - odd higgs is : @xmath9 since the value of @xmath10 is fixed by eq .",
    "( [ mucond ] ) , the above condition leads to the following condition for the higgs mass squared splitting : @xmath11 the recent higgs searches at the lhc set very stringent lower limits on @xmath12 .",
    "those limits are especially strong at large @xmath7 since the production cross - section of the pseudoscalar higgs is proportional to @xmath13 . for values of @xmath7 relevant for top - bottom - tau yukawa unification",
    "i.e. between about 40 and 55 , the cp - odd higgs with mass of order @xmath14 gev is excluded at 95% c.l .. @xcite we should , however , stress , that the problems with rewsb stemming from the condition ( [ mhumhdcond ] ) were identified a long time before the lhc era with a very mild assumption that the pseudoscalar higgs should be non - tachyonic.@xcite    the condition ( [ mhumhdcond ] ) has to be satisfied at the ew scale so the renormalization group ( rg ) running of @xmath15 is crucial for rewsb .",
    "an appropriate one - loop renormalization group equation ( rge ) is given by:@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath18 and we omitted terms proportional to the first and second generation yukawa couplings which are negligible .",
    "we included the effect of the right - handed neutrino which might be relevant if its mass is substantially smaller than the gut scale .",
    "notice that for universal soft terms at the gut scale , @xmath19 vanishes at the gut scale if @xmath20 as predicted by the minimal so(10 ) gut .",
    "therefore , the sign and the magnitude of @xmath15 at the ew scale is fully determined by the rg running of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ mhdmhurge ] ) .",
    "there are to competing effects on the rg running of @xmath15 .",
    "first : different hypercharge assignment of top and bottom results in the positive contribution to @xmath15 .",
    "this effect becomes more significant as the gaugino ( especially gluino ) masses increase .",
    "second : since the right - handed neutrino decouples ( at best ) only few orders of magnitude below the gut scale , the tau yukawa coupling drives @xmath15 towards negative values and this effect is more significant for larger scalar masses . in the case of universal soft terms at the gut scale , the impact of the above two effects on the rg running of @xmath15 is comparable and results in @xmath21 at the ew scale .",
    "this implies that the condition ( [ mhumhdcond ] ) requires @xmath22 and is most likely satisfied if @xmath23 . after taking into account the lhc bounds on the cp - odd higgs boson mass",
    ", this also implies that for the universal soft terms the condition ( [ mhumhdcond ] ) can be satisfied only for @xmath24 tev resulting in the gluino which is much too heavy to be discovered at the lhc with @xmath25 tev .",
    "however , it was found that for the universal soft terms at the gut scale top - bottom - tau yukawa unification can not be realized independently of the value of @xmath2.@xcite the reason is following . at large @xmath7",
    "there are sizable susy corrections to the bottom mass@xcite which have big impact on bottom - tau yukawa unification .",
    "the main finite corrections originate from the gluino - sbottom and chargino - stop loops and are given by:@xcite @xmath26 where the loop integral @xmath27 ( given e.g. in the appendix of ref .  )",
    "scales as the inverse of the mass squared of the heaviest particle propagating in the loop and is well approximated by @xmath28 with @xmath29 between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in order to allow for bottom - tau yukawa unification",
    "the above correction has to be negative with the magnitude of about 10% to 20%.@xcite the gluino - sbottom contribution dominates in the vast majority of the parameter space since the numerical coefficient in front of this contribution is much larger than the one in front of the chargino - stop contribution .",
    "in particular , the sbottom - gluino contribution dominates for @xmath22 , as required by the condition ( [ mhumhdcond ] ) .    assuming the dominance of the sbottom - gluino contribution in eq .",
    "( [ mbsusycorr ] ) , the finite susy threshold correction ( [ mbsusycorr ] ) can be conveniently rewritten using the experimental value of the strong coupling constant , the properties of the loop integral @xmath27 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ mbsusycorr ] ) and the value of @xmath32 required for top - bottom yukawa unification : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the heavier sbottom .",
    "the above formula together with the requirement that the finite susy correction ( [ mbsusycorr ] ) to the bottom mass does not exceed 20% leads to the upper bound for the higgs - mixing parameter @xmath35:@xcite @xmath36 is the gluino mass at the gut scale and it is also assumed that @xmath37 which is usually the case unless @xmath38 . for universal soft terms at the gut scale and @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath39 so the condition ( [ mubound ] ) is violated and the susy correction to the bottom mass is too large to allow for top - bottom - tau yukawa unification .",
    "therefore , the conditions ( [ mhumhdcond ] ) and ( [ mubound ] ) can not be simultaneously fulfilled unless some non - universalities of soft terms at the gut scale are introduced .",
    "patterns of non - universal scalar masses that may allow for top - bottom - tau yukawa unification consistent with rewsb under assumption of universal gaugino masses were investigated in ref .  .",
    "the necessary condition for top - bottom - tau yukawa unification is splitting higgs masses in such a way that @xmath40 at the gut scale .",
    "in such a case the condition ( [ mhumhdcond ] ) may be satisfied already at the gut scale and the yukawa - unified solutions with gaugino masses suppressed with respect to the scalar masses become viable , which in turn implies that the susy correction ( [ mbsusycorr ] ) to the bottom mass may have the magnitude appropriate for top - bottom - tau yukawa unification . however , since @xmath41 and @xmath42 are part of the same so(10 ) multiplet higgs masses can not be split without explicit breaking of the so(10 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , in the effective theory below the gut scale there is generically additional source of soft scalar masses which is a consequence of spontaneous so(10 ) gauge symmetry breakdown .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the squared masses of the mssm scalars acquire additional contribution proportional to their charges under the spontaneously broken u(1 ) ( which is part of so(10 ) ) .",
    "the magnitude of this contribution is set by the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath43-term of the broken u(1 ) which is model dependent but typically of the order of the soft scalar masses .",
    "after taking this effect into account the generic pattern of soft scalar masses in so(10 ) models is : @xmath44 where @xmath43 parameterizes the size of a @xmath43-term contribution .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the above structure of soft scalar masses can lead to top - bottom - tau yukawa unification compatible with rewsb if @xmath43 is positive and @xmath45 .",
    "yukawa unification is also very sensitive to the sign of higgs - mixing parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the sign of the dominant susy correction to the bottom mass , namely the gluino - sbottom correction , is the same as the sign of @xmath0 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ mbsusycorr ] ) .",
    "therefore , yukawa unification prefers the negative sign of @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , top - bottom - tau yukawa unification can be obtained also for positive @xmath0 .",
    "the phenomenological implications of yukawa - unified models differ significantly depending on the sign of @xmath0 so we discuss these two classes of models separately in the following sections .",
    "top - bottom - tau yukawa unification in the so(10 ) models with positive @xmath0 , the universal gaugino masses , @xmath2 , and the universal trilinear couplings , @xmath46 , has been extensively studied in the last decade.@xcite for positive @xmath0 the gluino - sbottom correction to the bottom mass has incorrect sign for yukawa unification so it has to be significantly suppressed , while the chargino - stop correction should be negative implying @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the chargino - stop correction has to be large enough to compensate positive gluino - sbottom correction and account for the total finite susy correction to the bottom mass of order 10 to 20 percent . from the inspection of eq .",
    "( [ mbsusycorr ] ) it can be seen that the suppression of the gluino - sbottom correction requires the heavier sbottom to be much heavier than the gluino . however , heavy sbottoms are usually accompanied by heavy stops which tend to suppress the chargino - stop correction .",
    "so , in order to obtain the desired magnitude of the finite susy correction to the bottom mass very large @xmath48 is necessary .",
    "this is possible only for a very large @xmath46 because the rges predict @xmath49 at the ew scale@xcite and the gluino should be light to suppress the gluino - sbottom correction .",
    "large negative values of the @xmath50-terms at the gut scale ( and during entire rg evolution down to the ew scale ) give very large negative contribution to the mass of the third generation sfermions .",
    "such contribution is especially dangerous for the right - handed sbottom because it is lighter than other squarks already at tree - level ( due to the @xmath43-term contribution ) so the rg effects of large @xmath50-terms can make the right - handed sbottom tachyonic .",
    "this is the main reason why the @xmath43-term splitting of scalar masses leads to rather poor yukawa unification - worse than at least 8%.@xcite - term splitting of scalar masses , which certainly has much better theoretical justification , with top - bottom - tau yukawa unification can be improved if the scale of the right - handed neutrinos is relatively small ( of order @xmath51 gev ) and the soft masses of the third generation sfermions at the gut scale are allowed to be smaller than the corresponding masses of the first and the second generation . in such a case yukawa couplings of top , bottom and tau can unify at the gut scale at the level of 2.5%.@xcite ] on the other hand , when only the higgs masses are split while the sfermion masses are universal perfect agreement with top - bottom - tau yukawa unification can be obtained.@xcite such a scenario was dubbed in the literature just so higgs splitting ( hs model ) .",
    "even though , the hs model explicitly breaks so(10 ) gauge symmetry it gained a lot of attention due to its ability to satisfy very restrictive condition of top - bottom - tau yukawa unification .",
    "early studies of the hs model have proven the existence of the yukawa - unified solutions with very light gluinos @xmath52 gev which were within the reach of the lhc at its early stage.@xcite however , gluinos have not been found up to now and the lower limit on the gluino mass in the hs model was found to be 620 gev at 95% c.l .. @xcite nevertheless , the hs model is not yet ruled out because recently new yukawa - unified solutions were found which are characterized by heavier gluinos with the mass up to about 1.5 tev ( 3 tev if yukawa unification at the 10% level is allowed).@xcite gluino pair production is a main signature of the hs model at the lhc .",
    "it is interesting to note that yukawa - unified solutions of the hs model are an example of radiatively - driven inverted scalar mass hierarchy which is obtained for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as shown in ref .  .",
    "sfermions of the first two generations have masses @xmath55 tev , while the third generation sfermions are much lighter , with the stop masses in the few tev range .",
    "one of the reasons why @xmath56 has to be very large are the constraints from rare @xmath57 decays.@xcite the presence of multi - tev scalars of the first two generations implies negligible susy contribution to @xmath4 resulting in more than 3@xmath58 discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the experimental result.@xcite since the stops are rather heavy and @xmath59 is large ( leading to rather large stop - mixing ) the lightest higgs is rather heavy .",
    "therefore , a requirement of the higgs mass in the vicinity of 125 gev does not have a large impact on allowed parameter space of the hs model .",
    "another interesting feature of the mssm spectra in the hs model is that gaugino masses do not respect the usual gut relation , @xmath60 .",
    "the unusual gaugino mass relation at the ew scale follows from the two - loop effects in the rges for gaugino masses which are non - negligible due to the very large values of @xmath46 required for yukawa coupling unification",
    ". one important consequence of the unusual gaugino mass relation is that @xmath2 may be below 100 gev without conflict with the lower limit on the chargino mass from lep .    in spite of",
    "the unusual gaugino mass relation at the ew scale bino is the lsp with the relic abundance few orders of magnitude above the upper wmap bound .",
    "several resolution to this problem have been proposed.@xcite one interesting possibility is to introduce non - universal gaugino masses and increase a value of @xmath61 at the gut scale ( keeping @xmath62 and @xmath63 fixed ) in such a way that @xmath64 at the ew scale and the bino - wino coannihilations reduce the relic abundance to phenomenologically acceptable values.@xcite the relic abundance of the lightest neutralino can be also reduced if one makes the additional assumption that the strong cp problem is solved using peccei - queen mechanism@xcite which leads to the existence of a pseudoscalar particle , axion,@xcite and its supersymmetric partner , axino.@xcite axino mass , @xmath65 , may be much smaller than the lightest neutralino mass.@xcite in such a case the axino would be the lsp with the relic abundance reduced by a factor of @xmath66 with respect to the neutralino lsp case .",
    "let us now discuss the case of negative @xmath0 in which the threshold correction to the bottom mass is typically negative , as preferred by the yukawa unification .",
    "if the gaugino masses are universal the negative sign of @xmath0 leads to the discrepancy with the experimental results for @xmath4 and br@xmath5.@xcite consistency with these constraints requires @xmath67 , see e.g. ref .  .",

    "gluinos from yukawa - unified models with @xmath90 can be light enough to be detected during the present run of the lhc at @xmath25 tev .    for testing the so(10 ) models with negative @xmath0",
    "one needs to wait a little bit longer but this class of models can be tested at the lhc in several ways . in the a - funnel region ,",
    "the pseudoscalar higgs can be as light as 700 gev .",
    "due to big enhancement of the pseudoscalar higgs production cross - section by large values of @xmath7 , as predicted by top - bottom - tau yukawa unification , the lhc may have sensitivity to such a light pseudoscalar higgs even with @xmath25 tev .",
    "in addition , the lighter sbottom can be very light , with the mass as small as 250 gev , and strongly degenerate with the bino lsp leading to the prediction of the correct relic abundance of the dark matter due to efficient sbottom coannihilations .",
    "there are good prospects for a discovery of such a light sbottom nlsp at the lhc .",
    "gluino and squarks of the first two generations are rather heavy",
    ". nevertheless , gluino and the right - handed down squark with mass 2.5 and 2 tev , respectively , are possible , which makes them accessible at the lhc with @xmath86 tev .",
    "this work has been partially supported by stfc .",
