    "highly - collimated , oppositely directed jets are observed in active galaxies and quasars ( see for example bridle & eilek 1984 ; zensus , taylor , & wrobel 1998 ) , and in old compact stars in binaries ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; eikenberry _ et al .",
    "further , well collimated emission line jets are seen in young stellar objects ( mundt 1985 ; bhrke , mundt , & ray 1988 ) .",
    "recent work favors models where the twisting of an ordered magnetic field threading an accretion disk acts to magnetically accelerate the jets ( e.g. , meier , koide , & uchida 2001 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2001 ) .",
    "there are two regimes : ( 1 ) the _ hydromagnetic regime _ , where energy and angular momentum are carried by both the electromagnetic field and the kinetic flux of matter , which is relevant to the jets from young stellar objects ; and ( 2 ) the _ poynting flux regime _ , where energy and angular from the disk are carried predominantly by the electromagnetic field , which is relevant to extra - galactic and microquasar jets , and possibly to gamma ray burst sources .",
    "different theoretical models have been proposed for magnetically dominated or poynting outflows ( newman , newman , & lovelace 1992 ) and jets ( lynden - bell 1996 , 2003 ) from accretion disks threaded by a dipole - like magnetic field .",
    "later , stationary poynting flux dominated outflows were found in axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the opening of magnetic loops threading a keplerian disk ( romanova _ et al .",
    "mhd simulations by ustyugova _",

    "self - consistent  force - free field solutions are obtained where the twist of each field line is that due to the differential rotation of a keplerian disk .",
    "here , we consider relativistic poynting outflows from a rotating accretion disk around a kerr black hole . we assume that at an initial time @xmath9 an axisymmetric , dipole - like magnetic field threads the disk .",
    "the initial field geometry is shown in the lower part of figure 1 .",
    "this field could result from dynamo processes in the disk ( e.g. , colgate , li , & pariev 1998 ) .",
    "a more general magnetic field threading the disk would consist of multiple loops going from radii say @xmath10 to @xmath11 and @xmath12 to @xmath13 , etc .",
    "it is not clear how to treat this case analytically , but non - relativistic mhd simulations of this type of field show strong poynting flux outflows ( romanova et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the disk is assumed to be highly conducting and dense in the sense that @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the density and @xmath16 the angular rotation rate of the disk .",
    "thus a magnetic field threading the disk is frozen into the disk .",
    "further , we suppose that the radial accretion speed of the disk is much smaller than azimuthal velocity @xmath17 . for a corotating disk around a kerr black hole @xmath18 for @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the innermost stable circular orbit , where @xmath21 is the spin parameter of the black hole with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "for example , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the simplification is made that equation ( 1 ) also applies for @xmath26 .",
    "the region @xmath27 has a negligible influence on our results for the considered conditions where the radial scale of the magnetic field @xmath6 is such that @xmath28 .    in the space above ( and below ) the disk",
    "we assume a `` coronal '' or `` force - free '' ideal plasma ( gold & hoyle 1960 ) .",
    "this plasma may be relativistic with flow speed @xmath29 comparable to the speed of light .",
    "away from the head of the jet , the electromagnetic field is _ quasi - stationary_. this limit is applicable under conditions where the energy - density of the plasma @xmath30 is much less than the electromagnetic field energy - density @xmath31 .",
    "cylindrical @xmath32 coordinates are used and axisymmetry is assumed thus the magnetic field has the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 we can write @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the flux function . in the plane of the disk , the flux function is independent of time owing the frozen - in condition .",
    "a representative form of this function is @xmath37 where @xmath2 is the axial magnetic field strength in the center of the disk , and @xmath6 is the radius of the @xmath7point of the magnetic field in the plane of the disk as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is taken to apply for @xmath38 even though it is not valid near the horizon of the black hole . as already mentioned",
    "the contribution from region is negligible for the considered conditions where @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath39 has a maximum , with value @xmath40 , at the @xmath7point where @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 which corresponds to a uniform vertical field ,",

    "one finds that @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , so that there are two additional functions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    the function @xmath67 is determined along all of the field lines which go through the disk",
    "this follows from the perfect conductivity condition at the surface of the disk , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "this gives @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is zero at the disk and @xmath73 is the disk velocity .",

    "as mentioned above , we consider an _ initial value problem _ where the disk at @xmath9 is threaded by a dipole - like poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the form of @xmath81 in equation ( 3 ) is then determined by the differential rotation of the disk : the azimuthal _ twist _ of a given field line going from an inner footpoint at @xmath82 to an outer footpoint at @xmath83 is fixed by the differential rotation of the disk .",

    "the total twist of a field line loop is @xmath102 with the sign included to give @xmath103 .",
    "the integration goes from the disk at a radius @xmath104 out into the corona and back to the disk at a radius @xmath105 . for a prograde disk",
    "the field line twist after a time @xmath106 is @xmath107 -[\\omega(r_2)/ \\omega(r_0)]\\}. $ ]      our previous study of non - relativstic poynting jets by analytic theory ( l02 ) and axisymmetric mhd simulations ( ustyugova et al .",
    "2000 ) showed that as the twist , as measured by @xmath108 , increases a new , high twist field configuration appears with a different topology .",
    "a `` plasmoid '' consisting of toroidal flux detaches from the disk and propagates outward .",
    "the plasmoid is bounded by a poloidal field line which has an @xmath109point above the @xmath7point on the disk .",
    "the occurrence of the @xmath109point requires that there be at least a small amount of dissipation in the evolution from the poloidal dipole field and the poynting jet configuration .",
    "the high - twist configuration consists of a region near the axis which is _ magnetically collimated _ by the toroidal @xmath110 field and a region far from the axis which is _ anti - collimated _ in the sense that it is pushed away from the axis .",
    "the field lines returning to the disk at @xmath111 are anti - collimated by the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field . the _ poloidal field",
    "_ fills only a small part of the coronal space .    in the case of relativistic poynting jets",
    "we hypothesize that the magnetic field configuration is similar that in the non - relativistic limit ( l02 , ustyugova et al .",
    "thus , most of the twist @xmath112 of a field line of the relativistic poynting jet occurs along the jet from @xmath69 to @xmath113 as sketched in figure 1 , where @xmath113 is the axial location of the `` head '' of the jet .",
    "along most of the distance @xmath114 the radius of the jet is a constant and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",

    "this relation allows the closure of equation ( 3 ) which can now be written as @xmath123 where @xmath124= ( r\\omega / c)^2/(\\gamma^2 - 1)$ ] , and where @xmath125 .",
    "solution of equation ( 5 ) is facilitated by introducing dimensionless variables .",
    "we measure the radial distance in units of the distance @xmath6 to the @xmath7point of the magnetic field threading the disk ( equation 2 ) .",
    "we measure the flux function @xmath48 in units of @xmath126 .",
    "the fields are measured in units of @xmath2 which is the magnetic field strength at the center of the disk .",

    "dimensionless variables @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , equation ( 5 ) is the same with overbars on these three variables .",

    "this interpretation assumes that the radiating electrons ( and/or positrons ) are accelerated to high lorentz factors ( @xmath184 ) at the jet front and move with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath183 relative to the observer .",
    "the luminosity of the @xmath185 poynting jet is @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "the region of collimated field of the poynting jet may be kink unstable .",
    "the instability will lead to a helical distortion of the jet with the helix having the same twist about the @xmath188axis as the axisymmetric @xmath189 field .",
    "a relativistic perturbation analysis is required including the displacement current .",
    "the evolution of the jet evidently depends on _ both _ the speed of propagation of the lateral displacement and the velocity of propagation of the `` head '' of the jet @xmath120 .",
    "relativistic propagation of the jet s head may act to limit the amplitude of helical kink distortion of the jet .    for long time - scales ,",
    "the poynting jet is of course time - dependent due to the angular momentum it extracts from the inner disk ( @xmath190 ) which causes @xmath6 to decrease with time ( l02 ) .",
    "this loss of angular momentum leads to a `` global magnetic instability '' and collapse of the inner disk ( lovelace _ et al._1994 , 1997 ; l02 ) and a corresponding outburst of energy in the jets from the two sides of the disk .",
    "such outbursts may explain the flares of active galactic nuclei blazar sources ( romanova & lovelace 1997 ; levinson 1998 ) and the one - time outbursts of gamma ray burst sources ( katz 1997 ) .",
