    "in brief , a bit commitment ( bc ) is the following task that is executed in two steps ( ( a ) and ( b ) below ) by two mistrustful parties , a sender , alice , and a receiver , bob.(a ) commit phase ( c - phase ) : alice chooses a bit ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) and commits it to bob .",
    "that is , she gives bob a piece of evidence that she has a bit @xmath2 in mind and that she can not change it ( in this case , the commitment is said to be binding ) .",
    "bob can not learn the value of the committed bit from that evidence until alice reveals further information ( in this case , the commitment is said to be concealing).(b ) opening phase ( o - phase ) : at a later time , alice opens the commitment .",
    "that is , she tells bob the value of @xmath2 and convinces him that it is indeed the genuine bit that she chose during the c - phase .",
    "if alice changes the value , it can be discovered by bob .",
    "a bc is an important cryptographic primitive with many applications in more sophisticated tasks and is of great theoretical and practical interest .",
    "current classical bc protocols are proven secure by invoking some unproven computational assumption ; that is , complexity of some kind of mathematical problems such as the hardness of factoring large integers .",
    "after the invention of the quantum computing algorithm that makes the computational assumption totally invalid , it has been brought to many researchers attention whether there exists a bc protocol that is guaranteed secure solely by physical principles . in recent years , mayers , lo , and chau have proven that an unconditionally secure bc is impossible ( no - go theorem for a bc ) under the standard nonrelativistic assumption.@xcite however , although their discussions are quite correct , their proofs are a bit formal and nonconstructive .",
    "it is not yet clear what prevents us from implementing the unconditionally secure bc protocol . in this paper , we give a constructive proof of the no - go theorem for a bc that would make things more transparent and convincing from the viewpoint of quantum information theory .",
    "we clarify why quantum mechanics does not help a quantum bc protocol to achieve more than a classical one does .",
    "first , let us consider an honest protocol .",
    "the most important point concerning the bc protocol is that alice needs to unveil a value of @xmath2 in the o - phase consistently with information transmitted in the c - phase . from the information - theoretic point of view",
    ", this implies that one bit of classical information should be transmitted from alice to bob at the end of the protocol .",
    "therefore , when we set @xmath3 and @xmath4 as the amounts of information in a bit transmitted in the c - phase and o - phase , the following identity holds : @xmath5namely , the bc protocol is essentially a split transmission of one - bit information in two temporally separated steps : one in the c - phase and the other in the o - phase .",
    "only a fraction of the bit information needs to be transmitted in each step .",
    "noting this fact , we can formulate the quantum bc protocols reported so far@xcite as follows .    in order to demand unconditional security",
    ", alice reveals to bob quantum information as a piece of evidence of her commitment by transmitting a system , such as a photon or an electron , in the c - phase . in the o - phase , she reveals to bob classical information which consists of the value of @xmath2 and the measurement basis on the system .",
    "finally , alice and bob test the consistency between the reported value of @xmath2 and the measurement results of the system .    according to the quantum description of the protocol involving classical communication suggested by tal mor ,",
    "let subsystem @xmath6 ( bob s system ) be the system with arbitrary dimensional state space @xmath7 that carries quantum information in the c - phase and subsystem @xmath8 ( alice s system ) be the system with arbitrary dimensional state space @xmath9 that carries classical information in the o - phase.@xcite let @xmath10 be the genuine states of the joint system @xmath11 to be prepared by alice according to her choice of @xmath2 . then , eq .",

    "according to the protocol , by transmitting a subsystem @xmath6 to bob , alice reveals , in general , nonorthogonal marginal states @xmath16(@xmath0 or @xmath1 ) in the c - phase .",
    "it is proven in appendix a that from condition ( [ eq2 ] ) , we can always find two mutually orthogonal purifications @xmath17 of @xmath18 in the orthogonal subspace in which the support of the state @xmath10 lies .",

    "[ f1 ] indicates that this requirement is never satisfied because of the trade - off relationship between @xmath118 and @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , even if we choose a balanced condition for both parties , @xmath119 , both @xmath118 and @xmath113 are already large enough .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that a law of quantum physics does not help to improve the security of the bc protocol .",
    "as already proven generally by mayers , lo , and chau , this conclusion should be valid not only for the particular cheating strategies described in this paper but also for any strategies that alice and bob can choose . to understand this conclusion ,",
    "consider the entropy of entanglement ( or entanglement in brief ) , which is known to be a unique measure of the amount of entanglement for the pure state.@xcite entanglement of the purification @xmath17 is defined as the von neumann entropy of the marginal state @xmath18 of @xmath71 or equivalently as the shannon entropy of the squares of the schmidt coefficients of @xmath75 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq13 ] ) , and ( [ eq16 ] ) , it is easily calculated as @xmath120here , it should be noted that @xmath117 is equivalent to maximum information @xmath3 available from @xmath18 that is transmitted from alice to bob in the c - phase ; that is , @xmath121applying eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) to ( [ eq31 ] ) , we obtain the inequality , @xmath122this inequality implies two things .",
    "first , the performance of alice s cheating , when it is measured by @xmath113 , is bounded by the entanglement of the purification @xmath123 , which is determined only by its marginal state @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) ) .",
    "second , it is also bounded by the amount of information @xmath4 that is revealed in the o - phase .",
    "these implications are reasonable for the following reason .",
    "when alice wants to cheat bob , what she can do is restricted to local operation and measurement on the subsystem @xmath8 in her hand after she has revealed @xmath124 by transmitting the subsystem @xmath6 .",
    "it is known to be a fundamental law of quantum information processing that entanglement can not be increased if we are allowed to perform only local operations and subselection on the subsystem of a joint system . in this restricted situation , the best she can do to cheat is use the local unitary operation that conserves the entanglement shared in the joint system and keeps the marginal states @xmath124 unchanged .",
    "otherwise , the strategy must be by far an optimal one because a fraction of the entanglement must be lost from the joint system and dissipate into the environment during the local operation .",
    "under such circumstances , alice can change the information content encoded only in the relative phase between coefficients of each term in the purification @xmath125 , but she can not change the information content encoded in their absolute values . it is the entanglement resource that is responsible for alice s cheating , and there is no cheating strategy that can break the bound given by entanglement @xmath123 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) .",
    "in addition , it is also reasonable that only partial information that is to be revealed in the o - phase can be used for alice s cheating but the partial information already revealed in the c - phase can not .",
    "conversely , we must be aware that alice makes use of partial information that is reserved to be revealed in the o - phase as an entanglement resource for cheating .",
    "it is worth noting that the present proof can be regarded as a concrete example of the general proof of the no - go theorem for a zero - knowledge - convincing protocol recently given by horodecki et al.horodecki our proof clearly indicates that if alice wants to convince bob that she has a definite value of a commit bit ( which is , of course , _ classical _ information ) in mind in the c - phase , the information provided by her to him in the c - phase has to carry nontrivial information about the commit bit in her mind . if the information revealed in the c - phase is independent of her commit bit , alice can always try to cheat by proposing the test which would give some result with certainty and independently of her commit bit in the o - phase .",
    "our proof suggests an information - theoretic ground for the no - go theorem of the zero - knowledge - convincing protocol .",
    "namely , any protocol with a test message that convinces bob that alice knows some state @xmath126 ( which is , in general , _ quantum _ information ) , the test message has to carry non - zero information about state @xmath126 to prevent alice s cheating .",
    "the present proof implies that the conjecture of mayers about two - party secure computation , which states that the symmetric protocol might be possible whereas the asymmetric tasks , such as unidirectional secure computations , would be impossible , is correct.@xcite in the unidirectional two - party computation , which allows only one of the two parties to learn the result , both members of the party can be a cheater and security requirements for both members are incompatible .",
    "such unidirectional protocols under the standard nonrelativistic assumption are necessarily insecure .",
    "we believe that unidirectional quantum communication does not achieve more than classical communication alone in the two - party model .",
    "however , it has not yet been proven that no non - trivial cryptographic tasks in the two - party model using bidirectional quantum communication are unconditionally secure . indeed",
    ", there are some proposals on the quantum protocols for non - trivial weaker tasks in two - party bidirectional quantum communication such as quantum coin - tossing@xcite and quantum gambling.@xcite it will still be important to solve the general problem concerning what is possible and what is impossible in two - party secure computation when unproven computational assumptions are abandoned .",
    "in conclusion , we have given constructive proof why an unconditionally secure quantum bc is impossible in the light of quantum information theory .",
    "the bc protocol is in essence the protocol in which one - bit information is split and revealed in two temporally separated steps : the c - phase and the o - phase .",
    "it ensures only a fraction of the bit information is revealed at a time . in the quantum bc protocol ,",
    "increasing the information revealed in the c - phase is to bob s advantage ; conversely , increasing the information revealed in the o - phase makes things to alice s advantage .",
    "this situation is similar to the classical protocol .",
    "furthermore , the protocol that is unbiased to both alice and bob is not secure for both . therefore , it is impossible to design a bc protocol whose security is established solely on the law of quantum physics .",
    "in addition , it has been clarified that , alice can make use of the entanglement resource , which is equal to the amount of information reserved to be revealed in the o - phase , to cheat . to prevent alice s cheating ,",
    "the information revealed in the c - phase must depend on her commit bit , and it must inevitably carry non - zero information about her commitment . it can be concluded that quantum mechanics itself makes designing an unconditionally secure bc protocol impossible .",
    "suppose that the states @xmath10 ( @xmath128 ) of joint system @xmath11 that is to be prepared by alice are mutually orthogonal on the joint space @xmath129 ; i.e. , @xmath130because @xmath131 and @xmath13 commute , they can be diagonalized simultaneously in terms of orthonormal bases @xmath132 and @xmath133 in @xmath19 as follows : @xmath134where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are mutually orthogonal ; i.e. , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 and @xmath139 are sets of real eigenvalues of @xmath10 satisfying @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
