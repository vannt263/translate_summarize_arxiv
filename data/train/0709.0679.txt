    ", the curvature can be written as    @xmath21    the torsion , @xmath9 , measures the deviance of the trajectory from a planar curve and can be written as    @xmath22    if the torsion is zero , the trajectory lies completely in one plane .",
    "conversely , a positive torsion corresponds to a right  handed helicity whereas a path with negative torsion has a left  handed helical component .",
    "we measured the curvature for beads moving in either two or three dimensions using chambers of two different thicknesses .",
    "the rms curvature measured for these two situations , @xmath23 ( table  [ tableparams ] ) , are within error of each other and are in good agreement with the curvature deduced from previous video  microscopy studies of motion of both beads and bacteria of approximately @xmath24 @xcite .    to our knowledge , only one theoretical treatment of actin ",
    "driven motion has considered the molecular mechanism that produces looping trajectories .",
    "rutenberg and grant @xcite showed that a small number of randomly distributed actin filaments pushing a load will give rise to an intrinsic curvature due to the non  zero instantaneous torque produced by summing the forces from each filament .",
    "for a uniformly  coated bead this curvature is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the bead radius and @xmath27 is the number of pushing filaments .",
    "in this model , the distribution of curvatures depends only on the rms value , and for a bulk , 3d geometry can be written as @xcite    @xmath28    this distribution contains a single broad peak at @xmath29 ( figure [ figcurvature]a dotted line ) , and thus beads are predicted to move with a `` preferred '' curvature which leads to looping paths .    to directly test this model we calculated the curvature probability distribution from our measured 3d trajectories ( figure  [ figcurvature]a ) . rather than a peaked distribution , we find that the curvature distribution decays monotonically , with smaller curvatures , i.e. straighter path segments , more probable that curved ones",

    "the curvature has been normalized by its rms value from each run . for comparison ,",

    "( b ) autocorrelation of the path curvature .",
    "the autocorrelation of the curvature as a function of path length for a single bead trajectory ( open circles ) and a fit of this data to a single exponential decay ( red solid line ) [ figcurvature ] ]    bead paths most often had low curvatures ; fifty percent of the time the radius of curvature was greater than @xmath30 .",
    "if this is true , how can we reconsile the appearance of looping trajectories such as those shown in figure  [ figtraces]a in the 2d chambers ? an alternative model to that proposed in reference @xcite is that while smaller curvatures are preferred , network curvature can only change via slow dynamics .",
    "if the time to change path curvature is greater than the time to go around a loop , @xmath31 , a path will necessarily complete a loop before significantly altering its trajectory .",
    "these dynamics may be associated , for instance , with the time required to significantly restructure the micro  architecture of the filaments .",
    "we quantified the temporal dynamics of trajectory curvature by calculating the autocorrelation of the measured curvatures over time ( figure  [ figcurvature]b ) .",
    "the autocorrelation decays exponentially with an average decay constant , @xmath8 , of @xmath32 m for 3d movement , corresponding to an decay time of @xmath33  seconds . in the 2d chambers , the decay constant was lower than in 3d , measuring @xmath34 m , but corresponding to approximately the same decay time , 190  seconds because of the slower measured velocity .    from this data it is possible to describe why beads appear to move in looping paths when confined to 2d . while a path is most likely to be fairly straight at any instance in time",
    ", there is a small probability it will become highly curved .",
    "if a highly curved path is initiated , the slow curvature dynamics cause the path to remain highly curved for an extended period resulting in loops when confined to two dimensions . when allowed to explore a 3d space , where a constant curvature does not lead to planar loops , highly ",
    "curved path sections merely look `` curly '' rather than looping .    what might cause the @xmath35 time scale , which is much slower than the characteristic times for actin monomer addition , @xmath36 , or the addition of new filaments to the network,@xmath37 @xcite ?",
    "while our beads are round and uniformly coated with ricka , there may be some residual asymmetry to the spatial distribution of the nucleator . assuming that this density affects the shape and dynamics of network formation",
    ", a rotation of the bead relative to the network could yield a change in path curvature .",
    "therefore , it is possible that this time may correspond to the rotational diffusion time for a bead attached to a growing actin network . a second explanation could involve architectural changes in the actin network itself .",
    "recent evidence indicates that a growing actin network contains memory of past forces it has encountered @xcite .",
    "the actin networks propelling the bead may actively remodel their micro  architecture in response to load and other factors .",
    "we propose that the @xmath35 relaxation time we observe in the curvature autocorrelation function may represent the time ",
    "scale over which actin remodeling occurs .",
    "in addition to the curvature , we calculated the torsion for beads moving in 3d .",
    "the distribution of measured torsions was roughly symetric about zero with a small negative skew ( figure  [ figtorsion ] ) .",
    "the average torsion for all 3d runs was @xmath38 , not significantly different than zero .",
    "small sections of bead movement often appeared helical ( figure  [ figtraces]b ) , however overall our data shows that beads do not move in consistently helical paths .",
    "in addition , we measured the autocorrelation of the torsion and found no significant correlation over time .",
    "the average autocorrelation decayed to zero with a time constant equal to the smoothing time constant used to calculate the derivatives of the position with time , approximately 5 seconds .",

    "cells rotate around their long ",
    "axis @xcite suggest that our ricka ",
    "coated beads and _ listeria _ might move by slightly different mechanisms .",
    "listeria _ use the nucleation  promoting factor acta , which might produce a slightly different network architecture than that produced by ricka .",
    "electron - micrographs of _ rickettsia _ cells show comet tails with filaments arranged in a parallel geometry @xcite , although beads coated with ricka have been shown to produce dendritic networks similar to those generated by acta @xcite .",
    "second , _ listeria _ cells have been reported to produce a helical surface pattern of acta @xcite , which may give rise to a network that applies a constant torque to moving cells , producing helical trajectories and the looping trajectories seen in 2d @xcite .",
    "our uniformly coated bead would not experience this torque .",
    "we have presented experimental measurements of the 3d paths explored by actin  propelled beads . in a pseudo2d environment , beads appear to move in looping paths as has been shown previously for measurements using video  microscopy .",
    "in contrast , relaxing the restriction to 2d movement , we find that in 3d beads do not move in looping paths , but still exhibit curved , complex structures .",
    "differing from observations of moving _ listeria _ cells , our beads do not move in helical paths in 3d environment , and instead we measure an average torsion of zero .    while this new data places constraints on the physical mechanisms that give rise to the movement of ricka  coated beads , it also speaks to the geometric persistence inherent in an actin network .",
    "the correlation time we observe in the curvature of actin  propelled bead paths may be a limiting time for the change in direction of a growing actin network .",
