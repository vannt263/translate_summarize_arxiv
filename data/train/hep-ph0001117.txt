    "neutrinos have had , since their childhood in the early 30 s , profound consequences on our understanding of the forces of nature . in the past they led to the discovery of neutral currents and",
    "provided the first indication in favour of the standard model of electroweak interaction .",
    "they may be today at the very hart of yet another breakthrough in our perceptions of the physical world .",
    "today the results coming from solar neutrino experiments  @xcite as well as from atmospheric neutrino experiments  @xcite are difficult to be understood without admitting neutrino flavour conversion .",
    "nevertheless the dynamics underlying such conversion is yet to be established and in particular does not have to be a priori related to the electroweak force .",
    "the interesting idea that gravitational forces may induce neutrino mixing and flavour oscillations , if the weak equivalence principle of general relativity is violated , was proposed about a decade ago  @xcite , and thereafter , many works have been performed on this subject  @xcite .",
    "many authors have investigated the possibility of solving the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) by such gravitationally induced neutrino oscillations  @xcite , generally finding it necessary , in this context , to invoke the msw like resonance  @xcite since they conclude that it is impossible that this type of long - wavelength vacuum oscillation could explain the specific energy dependence of the data  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we demonstrate that all the recent solar neutrino data coming from gallium , chlorine and water cherenkov detectors can be well accounted for by long - wavelength neutrino oscillations induced by a violation of the equivalence principle ( vep ) .",
    "we assume that neutrinos of different types will suffer different time delay due to the weak , static gravitational field in the space on their way from the sun to the earth .",
    "their motion in this gravitational field can be appropriately described by the parameterized post - newtonian formalism with a different parameter for each neutrino type .",
    "neutrinos that are weak interaction eigenstates and neutrinos that are gravity eigenstates will be related by a unitary transformation that can be parameterized , assuming only two neutrino flavours , by a single parameter , the mixing angle @xmath0 which can lead to flavour oscillation  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we assume oscillations only between two species of neutrinos , which are degenerate in mass , either between active and active ( @xmath1 ) or active and sterile ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 being an electroweak singlet ) neutrinos .",
    "the evolution equation for neutrino flavours @xmath4 and @xmath5 propagating through the gravitational potential @xmath6 in the absence of matter can be found in ref .  @xcite . in the case",
    "we take @xmath7 to be a constant , this can be analytically solved to give the survival probability of @xmath8 produced in the sun after travelling the distance @xmath9 to the earth    @xmath10    where the oscillation wavelength @xmath11 for a neutrino with energy @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 \\left[\\frac{10^{-15 } } { |\\phi \\delta \\gamma|}\\right ] \\left[\\frac { { \\mbox{mev}}}{e}\\right ] , \\label{wavelength}\\ ] ] which in contrast to the wavelength for mass induced neutrino oscillations in vacuum , is inversely proportional to the neutrino energy . here",
    "@xmath14 is the quantity which measures the magnitude of vep .",
    "we will discuss here our analysis and results for active to active conversion . the same analysis for the @xmath15 channel",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , given similar results .    in order to examine the observed solar neutrino rates in the vep framework we have calculated the theoretical predictions for gallium ,",
    "chlorine and super - kamiokande ( sk ) water cherenkov solar neutrino experiments , as a function of the two vep parameters ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , using the solar neutrino fluxes predicted by the standard solar model by bahcall and pinsonneault ( bp98 )  @xcite taking into account the eccentricity of the earth orbit around the sun .",
    "we do a @xmath18 analysis to fit these parameters and an extra normalization factor @xmath19 for the @xmath20b neutrino flux , to the most recent experimental results coming from homestake  @xcite @xmath21 snu , gallex@xcite and sage@xcite combined @xmath22 snu and sk  @xcite @xmath23 normalized to bp98 .",
    "we use the same definition of the @xmath18 function to be minimized as in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that our theoretical estimations were computed by convoluting the survival probability given in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) with the absorption cross sections  @xcite , the neutrino - electron elastic scattering cross section with radiative corrections  @xcite and the solar neutrino flux corresponding to each reaction , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26be , @xmath20b , @xmath27n and @xmath28o ; other minor sources were neglected .",

    "cm    we present in fig .  1 ( a ) the allowed region determined only by the rates with free @xmath19 , for fixed @xmath20b flux ( @xmath29 ) the allowed region is similar . in ref .",
    "@xcite one can find a table which gives more details on best fitted parameters as well as the @xmath30 values for fixed and free @xmath19 .",
    "we found for @xmath29 that @xmath31 for 3 - 2=1 degree of freedom and for @xmath32 that @xmath33 for 3 - 3=0 degree of freedom .",
    "we then perform a spectral shape analysis fitting the @xmath20b spectrum measured by sk  @xcite using the following @xmath18 definition : @xmath34 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the sum is performed over all the 18 experimental points @xmath35 normalized by bp98 prediction for the recoil - electron energy @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the total experimental error and @xmath38 is our theoretical prediction that was calculated using the bp98 @xmath20b differential flux , the @xmath39 scattering cross section  @xcite , the survival probability as given by eq .",

    "@xcite permit us to compute the allowed region displayed in fig .  1 ( b ) .    finally , we perform a combined fit of the rates and the spectrum obtaining the allowed region presented in fig .  1 ( c ) .",
    "the combined allowed region is essentially the same as the one obtained by the rates alone . in all cases presented in figs .",

    "allowed regions .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a table with the best fitted parameters for this global fit as well as for the fitted values corresponding to the local minimum in these islands .",
    "note that only the upper corner of the fig .  1 ( c ) , for @xmath43 and maximal mixing in the @xmath44 channel can be excluded by ccfr  @xcite",
    ". moreover , there are no restrictions in the range of parameters we have considered in the case of @xmath45 oscillations .",
    "let s finally remark that , in contrast to the usual vacuum oscillation solution to the snp , in this vep scenario no strong seasonal effect is expected in any of the present or future experiments , even the ones that will be sensitive to @xmath26be neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the usual vacuum oscillation case , the oscillation length for the low energy @xmath24 and @xmath26be neutrinos are very large , comparable to or only a few times smaller than the sun - earth distance , so that the effect of the eccentricity in the oscillation probability is small . on the other hand , for higher energy neutrinos relevant for sk , the effect of the eccentricity in the probability could be large , but it is averaged out after the integration over a certain neutrino energy range .",
    "these observations are confirmed by fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have found a new solution to the snp which is comparable in quality of the fit to the other suggested ones and can , in principle , be discriminated from them in the near future . in fact a very - long - baseline neutrino experiment in a @xmath46-collider  @xcite could directly probe the entire parameter region where this solution was found .",
