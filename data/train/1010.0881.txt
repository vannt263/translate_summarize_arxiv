    "@xmath438    a parabola is defined by two of their points together with their tangents , so @xmath432 is uniquely determined . in the coordinate system of figure 1",
    "it has equation @xmath439 this is @xmath440 in our coordinate system since @xmath441 solving the quadratic equation for @xmath442 we get @xmath443 the derivative is @xmath444 now consider the tangent line to @xmath432 at an arbitrary point @xmath171 it has equation @xmath445 this line passes through @xmath446 which yields @xmath447 thus @xmath448 and similarly @xmath449 since the tangent line also passes through @xmath450 and @xmath451 was already proved .",
    "_ proof of theorem 3 , ( i ) .",
    "_ we have a plane @xmath452 curve @xmath9 parametrized by @xmath453 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 and a contractive linear map @xmath32 which maps @xmath9 into itself .",
    "we show that @xmath9 is contained in a parabola .",
    "the condition @xmath454 does not depend on @xmath455 it says that the curvature of @xmath9 at 0 is nonzero . in particular , any subarc of @xmath9 with the point 0 can not be contained in a line .    since @xmath456 and @xmath457 the map @xmath458 fixes the tangent line of @xmath9 at 0 .",
    "this must be an eigenvector of @xmath459 we use the jordan normal form of @xmath459 the classes of @xmath427 and @xmath452 curves , as well as the class of parabolas , and a curve s property of having nonzero curvature at a point , are preserved under linear transformations .",
    "for that reason , we can _ calculate with the jordan base as standard coordinate system .",
    "_ moreover , we assume that the first basis vector is an eigenvector of @xmath458 in the direction of the tangent of @xmath9 at 0 .",
    "thus @xmath458 has a matrix of the form @xmath460 where @xmath461 if @xmath462 note that @xmath463 since @xmath458 is contractive .    in the following ,",
    "we use coordinates @xmath464 instead of @xmath465 let us take a @xmath452 parametrization @xmath466 of @xmath9 in our new coordinate system with @xmath467 and @xmath468 ( the parametrization by arc length fulfils this condition ) .",
    "then @xmath469 since @xmath470 by the choice of the first axis .",
    "so there exists a @xmath36 such that @xmath471 for @xmath472 thus @xmath473 is a monotone @xmath452 function for @xmath472    by the inverse function theorem , the inverse function @xmath474 is @xmath452 for @xmath475 and the composition @xmath476 is also @xmath452 for @xmath477 this function which describes @xmath9 in the vicinity of 0 will now be called @xmath478 and @xmath479 is eliminated .",
    "we have @xmath480 and @xmath481 since otherwise the curvature of @xmath9 at 0 would be zero .",
    "now we apply the assumption @xmath482 from @xmath483 with @xmath484 we get the derivatives @xmath485 @xmath486 for @xmath477 inserting @xmath487 and @xmath488 in ( 6 ) we obtain @xmath489 since @xmath490 thus @xmath461 since @xmath491 and @xmath492 are different .",
    "equation ( 6 ) now simplifies : @xmath493 for @xmath494 and @xmath495 for the limit @xmath496 we obtain @xmath497 since @xmath498 and @xmath499 is continuous .",
    "thus @xmath500 is a quadratic function for @xmath501 applying @xmath502 several times to that part of @xmath28 we see that the arc @xmath9 is contained in a parabola .",

    "if @xmath503 is a self - affine curve and @xmath504 with @xmath505 is a small piece of @xmath28 then @xmath506 is a contracting affine map with fixed point in @xmath504 which maps @xmath9 into itself .",
    "now assume @xmath507 is a @xmath452 curve and not subset of a line , so that @xmath508 for some parametrization of @xmath9 and some @xmath509 since @xmath510 is continuous , this implies @xmath511 for all @xmath80 in a small piece @xmath504 containing @xmath5 shifting our coordinate system to the fixed point of @xmath512 and applying part ( i ) , we see that @xmath9 is contained in a segment or parabola .  @xmath63    99 , _ on selfsimilar jordan curves on the plane _ , siberian math . j.",
