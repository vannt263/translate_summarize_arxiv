    "supernovae of type ia ( snia ) play an outstanding role for our understanding of galactic evolution and the determination of the extragalactic distance scale . however , the nature of their progenitors is still unknown ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "there is general consensus that the event is due to the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf when the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath0 ) is reached , but the nature of the progenitor system remains unclear .",
    "two main options exists : the merging of two wds in the so called double degenerate ( dd ) scenario @xcite , or mass transfer from a red giant / subgiant in the so - called single degenerate ( sd ) scenario @xcite . in the dd case , we know that most stars end up as white dwarf remnants and that a major fraction of stars are in binary systems , hence dds must be common among wds .",
    "what we do not know is whether there exist enough dds able to merge in less than one hubble time and produce a snia event . in the sd case , we know that white dwarfs accreting from a non - degenerate companion do exist , but we do not know whether such systems exist in sufficient number to account for the observed snia frequency , nor whether the wd grows enough to reach the critical mass for ignition .",
    "there is also evidence from a class of sub - luminous snia that both routes might be significant @xcite .    on the theoretical side three possible outcomes of the merger of a super - chandrasekhar mass dd",
    "are discussed in literature : a snia explosion leaving no remnant @xcite , @xcite , an accretion induced collapse producing a neutron star without a snia explosion @xcite , or the formation of a neutron star during a snia event @xcite .",
    "on the observational side several systematic radial velocity ( rv ) searches for dds have been undertaken starting in the mid 1980 s checking a total of @xmath1 white dwarfs rv for variations ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , but have failed to reveal any massive , short - period dd progenitor of snia .",
    "this negative result casted some doubt on the dd scenario .",
    "however , it is not unexpected , as theoretical simulations suggest that only a few percent of all dds are potential snia progenitors @xcite , @xcite .    in order to perform a definitive test of the dd scenario we have embarked on a large spectroscopic survey of @xmath2 white dwarfs ( eso * s*n ia * p*rogenitor surve*y *  spy ) .",
    "spy will overcome the main limitation of all efforts so far to detect dds that are plausible sn  ia precursors : the samples of surveyed objects were too small .",
    "spectra were taken with the high - resolution uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) of the ut2 telescope ( kueyen ) of the eso vlt in service mode .",
    "our instrument setup provides nearly complete spectral coverage from 3200  to 6650with a resolution @xmath3 ( 0.36  at h@xmath4 ) . due to the nature of the project , two spectra at different , `` random '' epochs separated by at least one day are observed .",
    "eso provides a data reduction pipeline for uves , which formed the basis for our first selection of dd candidates .",
    "a careful re - reduction of the spectra is in progress .",
    "differing from previous surveys we use a correlation procedure to determine rv shifts of the observed spectra ( cf .",
    "we routinely measure rvs with an accuracy of @xmath5kms@xmath6or better , therefore running only a very small risk of missing a merger precursor , which have orbital velocities of 150kms@xmath6  or higher .",
    "we have analyzed spectra of 558 white dwarfs and pre - white dwarfs taken during the first two years of the spy project and detected 90 new dds , 13 are double - lined systems ( only 6 were known before ) .",
    "results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "our observations have already increased the dd sample by a factor of six .",
    "after completion , a final sample of @xmath7200 dds is expected .",
    "spy is the first rv survey which performs a systematic investigation of both classes of white dwarfs : das _ and _ non - das .",
    "previous surveys were restricted to da white dwarfs , because the sharp nlte core of h@xmath4 allows a very accurate rv determination .",
    "this feature is not present in the non - da ( db , do ) spectra , but the use of several helium - lines enables us to reach a similar accuracy . our results in table  1 indicate that the dd frequency among da and non - da white dwarfs are similar .",
    ".fraction of rv variable stars in the current spy sample for different spectral classes .",
    "wd+dm denotes systems for which a previously unknown cool companion is evident from the red spectra ( not included in the da / non - da entries ) . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     our follow - up observations yielded parameters for several dds . we have completed the analysis for three double - lined systems summarized in table  [ t : sb2 ] .",
    "the mass sum of the he2209@xmath81444 system is as high as that of he1414@xmath80848 , but the he2209@xmath81444 system is closer and will merge within 4gyrs . on the other hand",
    "the wd1349 + 144 system consists of two low mass white dwarfs and has a rather long period and will merge only after more than 100 hubble times .",
    "our sample includes also another short period ( @xmath9 ) system , which will merge after 4gyrs and has probably a system mass above the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "thus this system is a very promising potential snia precursor candidate .",
    "however , the h@xmath4 line core of the secondary in this system is broad and shallow compared to typical da line cores , which makes the determination of a precise rv curve and therefore of the masses difficult .",
    "some additional data are necessary to verify our rv curve solution .",
    "results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "spy has now finished a major fraction of the survey .",
    "our analysis of the data from the first 24 months has already quadruplicated the number of white dwarfs checked for rv variability ( from 200 to 760 ) and increased the number of known dds from 18 to 108 compared to the results of the last 20 years .",
    "our sample includes many short period systems ( table  1 ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , several with masses closer to the chandrasekhar limit than any system known before , greatly improving the statistics of dds .",
    "we expect this survey to produce a final sample of @xmath7200 dds .",
    "this will also provide a census of the final binary configurations , hence an important test for the theory of close binary star evolution after mass and angular momentum losses through winds and common envelope phases , which are very difficult to model .",
    "an empirical calibration provides the most promising approach .",
    "a large sample of binary white dwarfs covering a wide range in parameter space is the most important ingredient for this task .",
    "we have started a project to exploit the information provided in the spy sample of dds .",
    "our ongoing follow - up observations already revealed the existence of three short period systems with masses close to the chandrasekhar limit , which will merge within 4gyrs to two hubble times .",
    "even if it will finally turn out that the mass of our most promising snia progenitor candidate system is slightly below the chandrasekher limit , our results already allow a qualitative evaluation of the dd channel . since the formation of a system slightly below the chandrasekhar limit is not very different from the formation of a system above this limit , the presence of these three systems alone provides evidence that potential dd progenitors of snia do exist .",
