    "the jlab 6  gev research program in hadronic physics can be separated into three broad areas of investigation : the structure of the nuclear building blocks ; the structure of nuclei ; and symmetry tests in nuclear physics . here , the results of eight recent experiments are presented that answer detailed questions of two of these areas :    * measure precisely the nucleon s charge and magnetization distribution * determine the internal structure of the nucleon in the valence region * develop the experimental methods for performing tomography of the nucleon * probe the nuclear interior with a controlled impurity to learn about deeply - lying shell structure * clarify the short - range nature of nucleon - nucleon interactions in nuclei and compare the properties of bound nucleons with free ones * test chiral perturbation theory by studying the properties of goldstone bosons    at present the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) accelerates electrons to 6 gev by recirculating the beam four times through two superconducting linacs , each producing an energy gain of 600 mev per pass . in the past decade there has been impressive progress at jlab in improving the quality of the polarized beam , such that a beam can be delivered routinely with a polarization of @xmath085% and an intensity of up to 200 @xmath1a . the base instrumentation in hall a has been used for experiments which require high luminosity and high resolution in momentum and/or angle of at least one of the reaction products .",
    "the central elements are the two high resolution spectrometers ( hrs ) , to which recently a third spectrometer has been added with a large acceptance ( bigbite ) . the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) in hall b is used for experiments that require the detection of several , loosely correlated particles in the hadronic final state at a limited luminosity .",
    "the hall c facility has generally been used for experiments which require high luminosity at moderate resolution .",
    "the core spectrometers are the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) and the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) .",
    "the hms has a maximum momentum of 7.6 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "of the experiments presented here , only @xmath3he(@xmath4 )  used just the base equipment , all others needed additional specially designed instrumentation and three experiments , primakoff , hypernuclear spectroscopy in hall c and @xmath5 used only the beam line in the hall it was run .",
    "an upgrade of the cebaf accelerator to 12 gev has recently obtained the cd-2 approval , an essential component of the formal doe process for large projects .",
    "the project also includes the construction of a fourth experimental hall and the upgrade of two of the existing halls .",
    "it is on track to provide a first 11 gev beam in 2013 .",
    "although the partonic structure of the proton has been studied in great detail , much less is known about that of the neutron , mainly due to the unavailability of a free neutron target .",
    "thus , the information about the neutron had to be extracted from scattering data on nucleons bound in nuclei which resulted in substantial theoretical uncertainties . a novel detection technique , called bonus - for barely off - shell nucleon structure - has been recently implemented in the clas detector in hall b that allows to measure the inclusive electron scattering off an almost free neutron , eliminating to a large extent nuclear binding effects .",
    "this technique uses a low - momentum recoil detector to tag slow backward - moving spectator protons - with a momentum as small as 70 mev/@xmath2 - in coincidence with the scattered electron in the reaction @xmath6h(@xmath7)x , semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) .    ]    the structure functions of the nucleon reflect a variety of aspects of qcd , from asymptotic freedom at large momenta down to confinement at the hadronic scale . from measurements of these structure functions in the scaling region",
    "one can extract the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , the information on the momentum and spin carried by the quarks as a function of bjorken @xmath8 . in the non - perturbative region",
    "the structure functions in the nucleon resonance regime can be compared to qcd - inspired models .",
    "the applicability of quark - hadron duality can be probed by comparing the resonance structure and the partonic structure .",
    "although the high - quality jlab data on @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the resonance region , when averaged over the resonances , show remarkable agreement with the extrapolation of dis results in the perturbative region down to lower @xmath11 at comparable @xmath8 , no such comparison has been possible for the neutron .",
    "another open question of similar impact is the behavior of the structure functions as @xmath8 approaches 1 , in the region where the @xmath12 and @xmath13 valence quarks dominate , when all of the nucleon momentum is carried by a single quark .",
    "simple phenomenological models like su(6 ) symmetry predict a significantly different behavior than perturbative qcd or quark models with improved hyperfine interactions .",
    "figure [ fig : bonuslayout ] shows a schematic lay - out of the detector .",
    "it basically consists of a radial time - projection chamber ( rtpc ) surrounding a thin deuterium target .",
    "the rtpc is relatively small , 20 cm long and 13 cm in diameter , situated at the standard clas target position , inside the superconducting solenoid designed for the dvcs program .",
    "the target is a 20 cm long , 6 mm diameter kapton cylinder , holding deuterium gas at 7.5 atm . the 30 cm long solenoid is used to suppress the background due to mller electrons in both the recoil detector and the forward drift chambers .",
    "the rtpc is designed to provide position and timing information sufficient to identify low - momentum protons in the back hemisphere .",
    "it consists of 3 cylindrical gas electron multiplier ( gem ) detectors - the first implementation of curved gems - mounted around a kapton inner window with read - out pads on the outside .",
    "charged particles leave a trail of electron - ion pairs on passing through the sensitive gas inside the rtpc .",
    "a radial electric field forces the electrons to drift outwards while the field focusing due to the holes in the gems causes avalanche multiplication . finally , the signal is collected on the outer surface by individual pads .",
    "the location of the pads provides position information and the arrival time provides a measure of the radius where the electrons were produced . from the amount of charge",
    "produced the @xmath14 can be estimated and thus the mass of the particle traversing the rtpc .",
    "spectrum reconstructed using the backward - going spectator protons detected in bonus ( grey area ) , compared to a @xmath15 spectrum from dis off the deuteron.[fig : bonuscomm ] ]    the measurement of tagged structure functions in sidis off the deuteron , by detecting a slow recoil proton in the back hemisphere , will resolve the ambiguities introduced by nuclear effects in extracting neutron structure functions from dis off the deuteron . by detecting the spectator proton with the smallest momentum feasible ,",
    "one minimizes the degree to which the struck neutron is off - shell and thus the associated uncertainties .",
    "also , at such low momenta the deuteron wave function ( or more accurately the spectral function ) is well known . in the back hemisphere corrections due to target fragmentation",
    "are predicted to be very small .",
    "lastly , final - state interaction ( fsi ) effects have been calculated to contribute less than 5% to the spectral function - and thus to the extraction of @xmath16 - for spectator momenta less than 100 mev/@xmath2 at angles larger than 130@xmath17 .",
    "the bonus detector was successfully installed and commissioned in the fall of 2005 , followed by a first two - month production run for experiment e03 - 012@xcite with a 40 na beam at an energy of 3.2 gev .",
    "the bonus detector operated to full satisfaction at a luminosity of @xmath18 @xmath19s@xmath20 .",
    "the vertex could be reconstructed with an accuracy of @xmath01 cm ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bonuscomm ] ( left ) ) . in the right part of that figure the invariant - mass spectrum reconstructed with the bonus detector ( grey area )",
    "is compared to one obtained from dis off the deuteron .",
    "note that the width of the resonances has decreased thanks to the absence of fermi motion effects in the bonus data .",
    "the data obtained will provide accurate values of the ratio @xmath21 , and thus of @xmath22 , up to an @xmath8-value of @xmath00.5 .",
    "possible modifications of the properties of nucleons by the nuclear medium that they are bound in , have long been the subject of study .",
    "early conclusions drawn from the longitudinal / transverse ratio of the cross section for electron - induced proton knock - out have since been convincingly refuted@xcite . however , several calculations suggest a measurable deviation of the nucleon electro - magnetic form factors ( emff ) from their free - space values already at modest momentum - transfer values @xmath23 2.5 gev@xmath6",
    ". polarization transfer in quasi - elastic nucleon knock - out , ( @xmath24 , e@xmath25 ) , provides the required sensitivity to the properties of the nucleon in the nuclear medium . in free electron - nucleon scattering",
    "the measured ratio of the transverse and longitudinal polarization , transferred to the proton , is directly proportional to the ratio of the charge and magnetic form factors ( see section [ gen ] ) .",
    "this property has been used in a study of polarization transfer in @xmath3he , chosen as a target nucleus because of its high density and relatively simple structure , that facilitates microscopic calculations .     as a function of @xmath11 from mainz@xcite and e93 - 049@xcite ( open symbols ) along with preliminary results from e03 - 104 ( filled circles ) : @xmath26 is the ratio of transverse to longitudinal polarization of the knocked - out proton in @xmath3he(@xmath4 )  compared to the same ratio for @xmath27h(@xmath28 ) .",
    "the baseline @xmath29 is the value of @xmath26 obtained in a plane - wave calculation , to account for `` trivial '' effects of free @xmath30 moving protons .",
    "the data are compared to calculations from the madrid group@xcite and schiavilla _",
    "et al._@xcite.[fig : poltrans ] ]    earlier @xmath3he(@xmath4 )  polarization - transfer experiments were performed at mainz@xcite at @xmath11 = 0.4 gev@xmath6 and in hall a@xcite at @xmath11 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.6 and 2.6 gev@xmath6 . a recent experiment , again in hall a@xcite , has extended these measurements in 2006 with high precision at 0.8 and 1.3 gev@xmath6 .",
    "the data were taken in quasi - elastic kinematics at low missing momentum in order to minimize fsi and meson - exchange corrections .",
    "one of the two high - resolution spectrometers in hall a was used to detect the scattered electron , the other to detect the knocked - out proton .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of protons scattered by a graphite analyzer was measured in a focal - plane polarimeter@xcite to yield the polarization observables .",
    "the two - body character of the reaction was identified with the missing - mass technique .",
    "polarization transfer in the @xmath27h(@xmath28 )  reaction was measured at the same kinematics in order to study the differences between the in - medium polarization transfers and the free values .",
    "the proton form - factor ratio @xmath31  extracted from the hydrogen data was found to be in excellent agreement with previous polarization - transfer data@xcite .",
    "the results of the present experiment are expressed in terms of the polarization - transfer double ratio , in which the @xmath3he polarization - transfer ratio is normalized to the @xmath27h one , measured under identical conditions :    @xmath32    nearly all systematic uncertainties cancel in @xmath26 , the remaining small uncertainties are predominantly due to the spin transport in the hrs spectrometer .",
    "the induced proton polarization @xmath33 was also extracted from the helicity - independent fpp data and is a direct measure of fsi effects .",
    "the preliminary results for the double ratio @xmath26 are shown in fig .",

    "et al._@xcite by themselves overpredict the data by @xmath06% . on the other hand , if the density - dependent medium - modified form factors calculated by lu _ et al._@xcite are folded into udias calculations ( qmc ) , a good agreement is obtained with most data , indicating possible modifications of the proton emff by the nuclear medium",
    ". however , the observed suppression of the super - ratio has been equally well described by a more traditional calculation by schiavilla _",
    "et al._@xcite with free form factors in which charge - exchange fsis and meson - exchange and isobar current effects have been included .",
    "the high statistics of the present experiment@xcite will allow a study of the individual polarization observables as a function of the missing momentum @xmath34 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the observed low value of @xmath26 at @xmath11 = 0.8 gev@xmath6 could be interpreted as an indication of a @xmath11-dependence of @xmath26 not predicted by any of the calculations shown .    ; note that the experimental data have been corrected for the spectrometer acceptance .",
    "[ fig : inducpol ] ]    the results for the induced polarization @xmath33 are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : inducpol ] . as mentioned earlier , @xmath33 is directly sensitive to fsi effects .",
    "the present large size of the systematic errors is due to the uncertainty in instrumental asymmetries that will decrease strongly with further analysis .",
    "the data have been corrected for the hrs acceptance to facilitate a comparison with the calculations .",
    "the data suggest that the fsi effects have been overestimated in schiavilla s calculations",
    ". it will be interesting to see how his calculations for @xmath26 will change once he has optimized his calculations for @xmath33 .",
    "the two - photon decay mode of the neutral pion @xmath35 is completely due to the quantum fluctuations of the quark fields coupling to a gauge field , a symmetry breaking of purely quantum - mechanical origin . in the chiral su(2 )",

    "the main contribution to the shift upwards of nearly 0.4 ev is due to isospin breaking that introduces components from the @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the physical @xmath35 .",

    "the predictions from chiral perturbation theory are also shown , to leading and to next - to - leading order@xcite and one using the qcd sum rule@xcite.[fig : primexres ] ]    however , the experimental knowledge of the decay width is much less established , with a current world - average value of 7.74 @xmath39 0.55 ev . in the first place",
    "the assigned error is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the theoretical estimate , but the experimental results show an even larger dispersion .",
    "two methods have been used to measure the @xmath35 decay width ( or equivalently its lifetime ) .",
    "a direct measurement can be made by observing the decay distance between the production and decay points , using a two - foil technique , in which the pion is produced in the first foil and the decay photons are pair converted in the second foil .",
    "the only such direct measurement has been performed at the cern sps@xcite .",
    "the alternative method uses the primakoff effect , in which photons produce pions in the coulomb field of a nucleus .",
    "three such measurements , all using bremsstrahlung beams , have been reported@xcite with a large dispersion as is evident from fig . [",
    "fig : primexres ] .",
    "the tagged photon facility in hall b at jlab provides significant advantages for a new high - precision measurement of the @xmath35 decay width using the primakoff effect : the well - defined photon energy enables a clean separation of background processes and the tagging technique allows a better control of systematic errors . besides the primakoff effect , three additional processes contribute to pion photoproduction at high energies : nuclear coherent and incoherent scattering and interference between primakoff and coherent scattering .",
    "these processes can be separated by their different angular behaviors ( see fig . [",
    "fig : primexcross ] ) .",
    "consequently , a detector is needed for the @xmath35 detection with good angular resolution to identify the competing processes and good energy resolution to suppress multi - photon backgrounds through cuts on the invariant mass .",
    "a hybrid design was chosen for this calorimeter ( hycal ) in order to optimize the performance and cost .",
    "the central part contains 1152 pbwo@xmath43 crystals , 20.5 x 20.5 x 180 mm@xmath44 each , arranged in a square array with a four - block hole in the center to allow the beam to pass through .",
    "the central part is surrounded by 576 lead glass blocks , 38.2 x 38.2 x 450 mm@xmath44 each .",
    "the total size of the calorimeter , 116 x 116 cm@xmath6 , is sufficient to detect both decay photons from a @xmath35 meson produced at the target 7.3 m upstream .",
    "an essential requirement for the experiment is to determine the cross section with high absolute accuracy .",
    "the photon flux was measured with a lead - glass total absorption counter that was put into the beam periodically and monitored continuously with a pair spectrometer that detected the e@xmath46e@xmath47 pairs produced in the target using a dipole magnet and a set of scintillators .",
    "the thickness of the two targets used , @xmath42c and @xmath48pb , was measured to an accuracy of 0.04% .     cross section on @xmath42c , together with the contributions from the primakofff effect ( dashed ) , from nuclear coherent ( dot - dashed ) and incoherent ( grey full ) scattering and from the interference ( short - dashed ) between primakoff and coherent scattering.[fig : primexcross ] ]    the experiment@xcite ran for three months ( one month for commissioning and two for production running ) in late 2004 at a beam energy of 5.7 gev .",
    "the energy and angular resolution of the central part of the calorimeter were shown to be 2.3% ( at a photon energy of 1 gev ) and 0.34 mrad , respectively , resulting in an invariant mass resolution of 2.3 mev/@xmath49 at the @xmath35 mass .",
    "a very clean identification of elastic @xmath35 events was obtained after a final correlated cut on the invariant mass and the so - called elasticity - the ratio of the energy of a cluster pair and the tagger energy - .",
    "the angular distribution of those events , using only the central part of the calorimeter , is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : primexcross ] .",
    "finally , the primakoff cross section was extracted from a fit to the angular distribution in which the amplitudes for the primakoff , coherent and incoherent scattering and the phase of the interference term were varied . the preliminary result for",
    "the @xmath35 decay width from only the @xmath42c data is 7.93 ev @xmath39 2.1% @xmath39 2.0% , in excellent agreement with the nlo predictions .",
    "the main limitations to reach the projected goal of a 1.4% accuracy are statistics ( presently 1.8% , caused by cutting the run short and limiting the analysis so far to the central part of hycal ) and the uncertainty in the photon flux ( presently 1.1 % ) .",
    "in the final analysis both those issues will be addressed .",
    "information about the deeply - lying shell structure of the nuclear interior is difficult to obtain since all available nucleon levels are filled , and the addition of a nucleon to a low - lying shell is blocked by the pauli principle . because a @xmath50 hyperon does not suffer from pauli blocking , it can be inserted deep inside a nucleus as an impurity , thus providing a sensitive probe of the nuclear interior .",
    "in addition , the elementary hyperon - nucleon interaction can be studied with great sensitivity in hypernuclear spectroscopy .",
    "nuclear matter containing strangeness is also predicted to play an important role in stellar objects such as neutron stars . in the past , hypernuclear",
    "spectroscopy has been studied with hadronic reactions , severely hampered by the poor beam quality of the secondary pion and kaon beams .",
    "kaon electro - production from nuclei makes it possible to deposit a tagged @xmath50 deep inside the nucleus , and to observe its interaction with the nuclear system . a excellent energy resolution ( to separate the individual states in the hypernuclear system ) and a high beam intensity ( to compensate for the small cross section )",
    "are essential requirements for such studies .",
    "electro - production provides a number of advantages over earlier studies@xcite :    * the excellent beam quality makes it possible to identify hypernuclear states with a resolution of potentially @xmath0300 kev * due to the large momentum transferred and strong spin - flip amplitudes in electro - production hypernuclear states can be created with natural and unnatural parity and low and high spin * the ( @xmath51 ) pair is produced on the proton in contrast to hadronic studies where it is produced on the neutron , making it possible to study different hypernuclei and charge - dependent effects from a comparison of mirror hypernuclei , @xmath52 @xmath53b - @xmath53c    the multi - gev high - intensity beam at jlab thus provides a unique opportunity to study hypernuclear spectroscopy .",
    "two different implementations have been chosen in halls a and c.    in hall c the so - called `` zero - degree tagging '' configuration was chosen , whereby the production rate was optimized by detecting both the scattered electrons and the kaons at extreme forward angles with a beam energy close to the reaction threshold , @xmath01.8 gev .",
    "a splitter magnet was used to separate the electrons and the kaons to different spectrometers . in a first experiment@xcite a missing - mass resolution of 900 kev was obtained in @xmath53b , but the production rate was severely limited by accidental coincidences from bremsstrahlung . in a follow - up experiment@xcite the electron spectrometer , the same enge split - pole as in the first experiment , was slightly - by @xmath08.5@xmath17  - tilted vertically which significantly suppressed both the bremsstrahlung and the mller rate . also the sos spectrometer ( short - orbit ) was replaced by a new high - resolution kaon spectrometer ( hks ) with two layers of water and three layers of aerogel erenkov detectors for particle identification . in this new configuration data were taken in 2005 with a hypernuclear production rate of @xmath010 per hour .",
