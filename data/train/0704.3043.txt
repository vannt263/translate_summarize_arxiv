    "since the detection of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the cobe satellite in 1992 @xcite , great improvements in the quality of the cmb data has been achieved , mainly from very recent baloon and satellite experiments , such as the boomerang @xcite and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite . in what concerns the possible implications on the inflationary epoch , for instance ,",
    "the current three - year wmap ( wmap3 ) data seemed , at a first moment , to have precision enough to discriminate between some single - field inflationary models .",
    "in fact , soon after the wmap3 data release , some authors arrived to the conclusion that quartic chaotic inflationary scenarios of the form @xmath9 were ruled out , while quadratic chaotic inflationary models with potential , @xmath10 , agreed only marginally with the observational data @xcite .",
    "the original wmap3 parameter - estimation analysis also pointed to a spectral index smaller ( @xmath11 ) than the zeldovich spectrum of density perturbations , for which adiabatic perturbations have a scale - invariant spectral index ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "although compatible with some theoretical predictions @xcite , the latter conclusion was rediscussed by a recent analysis of the wmap3 data from a more sophisticated statistical approach of model selection and systematic effects , leading to values of @xmath4 still compatible with the zeldovich prediction @xcite .",
    "the wmap3 data also place an upper limit on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , i.e. , @xmath13 ( at 95.4% c.l . ) , whereas a joint analysis involving the wmap3 data and the large - scale power spectrum of luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provides @xmath14 ( also at 95.4% c.l . ) @xcite . in light of all these observational results ,",

    "@xcite revived a interesting phenomenological model with a simple slowly - rolling scalar field that , in the light of the wmap3 data , does not present a pure de sitter inflationary expansion , but produce a zeldovich spectrum , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "given the current availability of high precision cosmological data and , as consequence , the real possibility of truly ruling out some theoretical scenarios , it is timely to revive old inflationary models ( as done in ref .",
