    "the interaction of energetic particle beams with plasmas is ubiquitous in laboratory and in astrophysical scenarios , and so are beam - plasma instabilities such as weibel  @xcite , current filamentation @xcite and two stream  @xcite .",
    "the first two instabilities , also referred as weibel - like instabilities , are electromagnetic in nature and arise due to the anisotropy in the momentum distribution of the electrons , protons and ions .",
    "specifically , for the current filamentation instability ( cfi ) the role of the velocity anisotropy is played by the counter - streaming flow of the particle beams .",
    "these instabilities generate exponentially growing magnetic fields , providing one of the possible mechanisms for generating near equipartition magnetic fields in extreme astrophysical scenarios , such as gamma ray bursts ( grb )  @xcite , and are also closely associated with the formation of relativistic weibel mediated collisionless shocks @xcite in space  @xcite and laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "recently , the onset of the current filamentation instability was experimentally observed in counterstreaming plasmas in high power laser experiments  @xcite .",
    "experiments on laser wakefield acceleration have also reported the filamentation of the accelerating particle beam as it interacts with the background plasma @xcite .",
    "these instabilities provide an efficient way of restoring the isotropy in collisionless plasmas , since the energetic particles scatter off the self generated magnetic fields by which the longitudinal momentum is transferred to the transverse momentum .",
    "+ the available theoretical models for cfi are restricted mainly to a purely temporal analysis @xcite and do not capture any spatial characteristics of the instabilities , which can be very relevant for finite size systems  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we obtain the relativistic spatial - temporal solutions for the unstable transverse cfi modes in cold plasmas .",
    "our work and approach are inspired by refs .",

    "we further obtain the quasi - static and asymptotic behavior of the solutions .",
    "the theoretical results are compared with multidimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations using osiris  @xcite .",
    "such spatial - temporal analysis , shown in the later part of this paper , is relevant to the jets emitted by the x - ray binaries where the velocities of the jets are in relativistic range @xmath1  @xcite where spatial effects in the cfi modes are significant , or to the fireball - like beams  @xcite interacting with the plasma .",

    "<S> the spatial - temporal evolution of the purely transverse current filamentation instability is analyzed by deriving a single partial differential equation for the instability and obtaining the analytical solutions for the spatially and temporally growing current filament mode . </S>",
    "<S> when the beam front always encounters fresh plasma , our analysis shows that the instability grows spatially from the beam front to the back up to a certain critical beam length ; then the instability acquires a purely temporal growth . </S>",
    "<S> this critical beam length increases linearly with time and in the non - relativistic regime it is proportional to the beam velocity . in the relativistic regime </S>",
    "<S> the critical length is inversely proportional to the cube of the beam lorentz factor @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the ultra - relativistic regime the instability immediately acquires a purely temporal growth all over the beam . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results are in good agreement with multidimensional particle - in - cell simulations performed with osiris . </S>",
    "<S> relevance of current study to recent and future experiments on fireball beams is also addressed . </S>"
