    "understanding galaxy formation and evolution is one of the main challenges for present day astronomy and is one of the key drivers for many of the new and future large telescopes .",
    "the main paradigm for galaxy formation is that galaxies form by the coalescence of smaller objects , and by the accretion of gas directly from its environment ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main complications is the tight interplay between the star formation / agn activity and the surrounding ism / igm .",
    "this medium provides the material for forming stars and for fueling the activity of the central black hole but , conversely , the enormous energy output from both the stellar and the nuclear activity can have a major influence on the ism / igm and hence on the further accretion of material onto the galaxy .",
    "observations are beginning to quantify the impact that the energy released by the agn has on the host galaxy .",
    "one of the processes playing a key role is gas outflows . particularly relevant",
    "is the discovery that fast and massive outflows can also be traced by cold gas (  and co , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this has challenged our ideas of how exactly the energy released by an agn may interact with its surroundings .",
    "a number of different mechanisms have been suggested to originate the outflows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see , for overviews ) . among them , radio plasma jets are thought to be one of the main players in this complicated process .",
    "jets provide a particularly suitable way of transporting the energy .",
    "they couple efficiently to the surrounding medium , injecting energy into the large scale ism / igm , therefore preventing gas to cool and form stars @xcite .",
    "however , also on galaxy - scales they can have a major impact .",
    "numerical simulations have shown how radio jets can impact the ism on scales that go well beyond the narrow beam of the jet at least in the case in which the plasma jet enters a clumpy medium @xcite .",
    "what is new in this picture is the presence of a component of cold ( atomic and molecular gas ) as tracer of this interaction and , even more interesting , the fact that this is the major component ( in mass ) of those outflows .",
    "thus , observations of cold molecular gas with alma have become a powerful way to quantify the characteristics and impact of this phase of the gas .",
    "we have imaged using alma the distribution and kinematics of the co(2 - 1 ) emitting gas in the nearby ( z=0.011 , 1@xmath3 pc ) , southern radio - loud seyfert galaxy ic5063 .",
    "this was the first object where a fast outflow of neutral hydrogen was discovered ( morganti et al .",
    "follow up vlbi observations allowed us to establish that the region where the outflow is occurring coincides with the bright western radio lobe , roughly 0.5  kpc from the nucleus ( oosterloo et al .",
    "extremely exciting has been the finding ( using isaac on the vlt ) that this fast outflow also contains warm molecular gas ( h@xmath4 at 2.2@xmath5 m ) co - spatial with the bright radio hot - spot @xcite .",
    "this reinforces the idea of a prominent role of the radio jet as driver of these outflows .",
    "apex revealed that also cold molecular gas is associated with the outflow @xcite but , given the poor spatial resolution , could not locate the gas .",
    "this is the goal of the alma observations .",
    "ic  5063 was observed during cycle 1 with alma using band 6 , covering simultaneously the co(2 - 1 ) centered on 227.968  ghz and two additional base - bands ( at 232 and 247  ghz ) for imaging of the continuum . in fig.[fig1 ] the total intensity of the co(2 - 1 ) is shown with a zoom - in of the central region and overlaid the mm continuum image .",
    "the spatial resolution obtained is @xmath6 arcsec and the r.m.s .",
    "noise per channel in the co cube is 0.3 mjy beam@xmath1 .",
    "the alma observations give a detailed view of the complexity of the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the central regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "while the large - scale structure follows a regularly rotating disk , _ the gas in the inner regions is strongly affected by the radio jet_. indeed , the continuum emission is clearly co - spatial with the brighter inner - region detected in co ( see fig.[fig1 ] , right ) .",
    "thus , the alma data confirm the multi - phase of the gaseous outflow in ic  5063 , adding the cold molecular gas to the , warm molecular and ionized gas ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the observed distribution and kinematics of the cold molecular gas suggest that the radio plasma jet is driving the bulk of the gas outflow .",
    "therefore , we have developed a simple model to describe the kinematics of the gas , following the scenario presented in the numerical simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these simulations describe the effects of a newly formed radio jet when moving though a _",
    "dense clumpy medium_. this medium forces the jet to find the path of least resistance , while interacting and gradually dispersing the dense clouds away from the jet axis . in this way",
    ", clouds can be accelerated to high velocities and over a wide range of directions . along the path of the jet , a turbulent cocoon of expanding gas forms , moving away from the jet axis . in our toy - model ,",
    "we introduce a lateral expansion of the gas , away from the jet axis .",
    "this also causes the rotation velocity of the affected gas to be well below the nominal rotation of the gas in the disk , as indeed observed ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . despite its simplicity",
    ", the model provides a good first - order description of the observations .",
    "the full description of the results and of the model can be found in morganti et al .",
    "( submitted ) .",
    "we argue that the origin of the cold gas would be related to the efficient cooling of the gas after the shock produced by the jet : cold molecular gas would represent the final product of this cooling process , while warm molecular and  would be intermediate ( and less massive ) phases .    even assuming the most conservative values for the conversion factor co - to - h@xmath4",
    ", we find that the mass of the outflowing gas is between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 , of which between @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath9  is associated with the fast outflow at the location of the w lobe , i.e. much larger that what found in the other phases of the gas . using these values ,",
    "we derive a mass outflow rate ( @xmath12 ) in the range 12 to 30 @xmath9 yr@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , both the radiation as well as the jet power would be energetically capable of driving the outflow .",
    "the fact that the radio jet plays the prominent role may suggest an higher efficiency of this mechanism or that this mechanism is more relevant at large distances from the nucleus .",
    "particularly relevant is the conclusion that the effect of the radio plasma can be significant also in objects , such as ic  5063 , that are often considered _ radio - quiet_. a number of cases where this situation may occur have been recently identified ( e.g.  ngc  1266 @xcite ; ngc  1433 @xcite and m51 @xcite ) , although ic  5063 represents the most clear case of such an interaction being on - going . because weak radio sources are more common than the powerful ones , this result has implications for the role of feedback in galaxy evolution .",
    "this paper makes use of the following alma data : + ads / jao.alma#2012.1.00435.s .",
    "alma is a partnership of eso ( representing its member states ) , nsf ( usa ) and nins ( japan ) , together with nrc ( canada ) and nsc and asiaa ( taiwan ) , in cooperation with the republic of chile .",
