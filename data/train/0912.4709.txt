    "according to einstein s theory of general relativity , a generic gravitational field has , at a time , three main effects on light : the shapiro time delay , the bending of rays and the curvature of wavefronts .",
    "the gravitational field acts respectively as a retarder delaying a light wavefront , as a prism tilting a light wavefront , and as a lens curving a light wavefront . in special relativity ,",
    "time delays can be also induced by inertial motion of the observer or the source as in the doppler effect and uniform motion of a observer can result in aberration , i.e. , an apparent change in the position of the source .",
    "hence , the curvature of a initially plane light wavefront by a gravity field is a purely general relativistic effect that has no special relativistic analogue . in order to obtain an experimental measurement of the curvature of a wave front ,",
    "samuel  @xcite proposed a method based on the relation between the differences of arrival time recorded at four points on the earth and the volume of a parallelepiped determined by four points in the curved wavefront surface .",
    "we will establish a discretized model of the wavefront surface by means of a regular triangulation for the study of the curvature(s ) of this surface .",
    "the main methods and results have been recently published in @xcite , in this work we will only expose a summary of them .",
    "let us consider a spacetime @xmath0 corresponding to a weak gravitational field determined by a metric tensor given in a global coordinate system @xmath1 by @xmath2 where the coordinate components of the metric deviation @xmath3 are : @xmath4    here @xmath5 represents the gravitational constant of the sun , located at @xmath6 , and @xmath7 represents the vacuum light speed .",
    "the null geodesics , @xmath8 satisfy the following equations ( see @xcite ) : @xmath9\\dot{z}^k\\nonumber\\\\          & & -(h_{44,k}\\delta^a_l+h_{ak , l}-{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}h_{kl , a})\\dot{z}^k\\dot{z}^l \\nonumber\\\\          & & -(c^{-1}h_{4k , j}-{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}c^{-2}h_{jk , t})\\dot{z}^j\\dot{z}^k\\dot{z}^a,\\label{pn1a}\\\\[.1 in ] 0 & = &   g_{\\alpha\\beta}\\dot{z}^\\alpha\\dot{z}^\\beta.\\label{pn1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in the first equation , the first and third terms in the right are of order @xmath10 , while the remaining terms are @xmath11 .",
    "the second equation is the isotropy constraint satisfied by the null geodesics .",
    "we consider a flat initial surface @xmath12 far from the sun formed by points @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) in an asymptotically cartesian coordinate system @xmath15 . for the discretization of @xmath12 a triangulation",
    "is constructed in such a form that each vertex is represented by a complex number of the set : @xmath16 the complex plane and the plane @xmath12 may be identified by means of the mapping @xmath17 .",
    "thus a regular triangulation @xmath18 of the initial wavefront @xmath12 is determined . at each vertex in @xmath18 a photon @xmath19 with velocity @xmath20 is located .",
    "the null geodesics equation may be written as a first order differential system @xmath21 , in phase space @xmath22 , which determines in @xmath23 ( the quotient space of @xmath24 by the global timelike vector field @xmath25 associated to the global coordinate system used in the post - newtonian formalism ) a flow : @xmath26 . for each time @xmath27 the image of @xmath12 under the flow @xmath28 determines a curved wavefront @xmath29 .",
    "the initial triangulation by @xmath18 induces a triangulation on the final wavefront @xmath29 , whose vertices we enumerate using the same labels used for the corresponding vertices in @xmath12 .",
    "+ let @xmath30 be a _ normal coordinate system _ with pole at the point @xmath31 and associated normal reference frame @xmath32 . under the coordinate transformation @xmath33 , from post - newtonian to",
    "normal coordinates , the metric tensor @xmath34 on the space @xmath23 is determined ( up to terms of first order in @xmath35 ) from @xmath36 by @xmath37      to compute differential magnitudes of the wavefront surface corresponding to the mesh @xmath18 at each inner vertex @xmath38 we consider the 1ring @xmath39_{j=1,\\dots , j , k=0,\\dots,5}$ ] formed by the six vertices @xmath40 closest to @xmath41 : for each 1ring @xmath42 $ ] one obtains on the mesh @xmath18 the image 1ring @xmath43 $ ] under the flow @xmath44 .    in a neighbourhood of the image point @xmath45 the wavefront can be approximated by a least - squares fitting of the data @xmath43 $ ] as the quadric @xmath46 : @xmath47 using adapted normal coordinates @xmath48 .",
    "using coordinates @xmath49 adapted to the quadric @xmath46 : the metric @xmath50 on @xmath23 induces a metric on @xmath51 of the form @xmath52 by means of a generalized gauss formula , the difference of sectional curvatures @xmath53 and @xmath54 associated with the plane generated by the tangent vectors @xmath55 , in @xmath56 and @xmath23 respectively , is the relative sectional curvature @xmath57 ( see  @xcite ) : @xmath58 whereas the mean curvature @xmath59 is determined by half the trace of the second fundamental form @xmath60 : @xmath61",
    "the ray tracing has been carried out using an integrator based on the classic taylor series method for ordinary differential equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this integrator presents the following advantages : allows the control of both the order and the step size employed in the method . in this integrator",
    "one may use extended arithmetic precision for the highly accurate computation required in this problem .",
    "( precision of @xmath62 binary digits and a tolerance @xmath63 are used to solve this problem . ) at each step the null constraint equation is preserved .",
    "+ hereafter , we consider the simplest gravitational model generated by a static sun , considered as a point . however , it can be applied to more complex and realistic gravitational fields of the solar system , as considered in @xcite .",
    "we now apply the ray tracing method to a light wavefront region propagating along a tubular neighborhood around the @xmath64-axis and where the inner and outer hexagons have radii of lengths @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the initial flat wave surface @xmath12 , perpendicular to the @xmath64-axis , is positioned at -100 a.u .. the wavefront @xmath67 is then determined after a trip of 101 a.u . ,",
    "i.e. , at the position of the earth . remember that the focal length for a light ray grazing an opaque sun is located at 548.30 a.u . from the sun .",
    "+ in figure [ figure ] , the surface @xmath67 at the time when the wavefront arrives at the earth is shown using a gray - scale to represent the relative sectional curvature ( note we have used a different scale on the @xmath64axis ) .",
    "one sees in this figure that the absolute value of the relative sectional curvature function defined on @xmath67 increases as the distance between the photon and the @xmath64axis decreases .",
    "suppose four receiving stations located at four points on an earth hemisphere .",
    "the arrival time differences between these stations depend on the curvature of the wavefront . assumed known the measurements of arrival times corresponding to four points @xmath68 on the wavefront it is possible to determine an approximation of the wavefront curvature in a region far enough from the sun ( say the earth ) , without resorting to the ray tracing method .",
    "an estimation of the gaussian curvature of the wavefront surface can be obtained using the notion of the wald curvature of a metric space established in distance geometry ( see @xcite ) that in the case of 2-dimensional manifolds agrees with the gaussian curvature .",
    "the wald curvature is determined as the limit of the embedding curvatures of metric quadruples isometrically embedded in surfaces of constant curvature ( the euclidean plane @xmath69 , the 2sphere @xmath70 or the hyperbolic space @xmath71 ) .",
    "+ in the hyperbolic plane @xmath72 of curvature @xmath73 , represented by the blumenthal model ( @xcite ) we consider the metric quadruple associated with the points @xmath74 assuming that the geometry of the 3space in the vicinity of the earth is euclidean .",
    "the wald curvature associated to the chosen quadruple @xmath74 prove to be @xmath75 this result gives an approximation of the total curvature of the wavefront surface under the assumption that locally this surface may be identified with a hyperbolic plane in which the quadruple considered is isometrically embedded .",
