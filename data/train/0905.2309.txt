    "according to the usual assumption , heavy quark partons in the nucleon are radiatively generated , i.e. , they appear only as a result of qcd evolution which starts from a null value at a scale of approximately the corresponding quark mass .",
    "there are two reasons , at least , for this assumption : _ i ) _ if quark mass is large enough , the partonic probability distribution function ( pdf ) is perturbatively calculable and _ ii ) _ up to now , exact experimental constraints on these pdfs are absent .",
    "the mass of charm quark ( @xmath2 gev ) lies in between the soft and hard scales , so , the standard method of pdf s calculation is not well justified . besides , from a theoretical point of view the existence of an `` intrinsic charm '' ( ic ) component of the nucleon is not forbidden .",
    "many nonperturbative models ( the light - cone models @xcite , the meson cloud picture @xcite , the mit bag model @xcite , @xmath3 quark model @xcite , etc . )",
    "predict such a component at an energy scale comparable to mass of charm quark @xmath4 .    in the present paper",
    "we use the predictions of the specific light - cone model developed in @xcite ( `` bhps model '' ) . in @xcite",
    "the pdf of charm quarks from the @xmath5-quark component @xmath6 in the proton is calculated .",
    "the @xmath6-fock state arises in qcd not only from gluon splitting which is included in dglap evolution , but also from diagrams in which the heavy quark pair is multi - connected to the valence constituents .",
    "the latter components are called intrinsic charm fock components .",
    "it was originally suggested in @xcite that there is @xmath7 probability of ic fock states in the nucleon .",
    "the materialization of the ic fock state ( after its interaction with the target ) leads to the production of open - charm states such as scalar mesons @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or vector mesons @xmath10 at large values of feynman variable @xmath0 .",
    "this may happen either through the coalescence of the valence and heavy quarks of the same rapidity , or through hadronization of the produced heavy quarks .",
    "in the present paper we do not consider the process of the coalescence ( and the corresponding leading particle effect ) and assume that quarks of @xmath11-pair fragment into hadrons independently of each other .",
    "the @xmath12-dependence for the pdf predicted by the bhps model is @xmath13 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 is the starting value for the factorization scale , @xmath15 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath16 is a variable parameter of the model .",
    "the magnitude of ic can be characterized by the momentum fraction carried by @xmath17 , @xmath18 dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the global qcd analysis @xcite rules out the possibility of an ic component with the momentum fraction @xmath19 much larger @xmath20 ( for @xmath21 ) .    from a point of view of qcd ,",
    "it is natural to expect that a contribution of heavy quark component in hadron s wave function can not be large , due to a suppression by the power of heavy quark mass squared .",
    "however , it is possible that this suppression is compensated by sufficiently strong nonperturbative gluon fields in the nucleon ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it had been shown in @xcite using the technique of heavy quark mass expansion , that the intrinsic charm contribution to the nucleon momentum , @xmath19 , at the scale @xmath22 , is proportional to the ( unknown ) factor @xmath23 ( which is determined by the matrix elements of gluon operators ) whose value can be obtained using nonperturbative methods in qcd ( e.g. , a theory of instanton vacuum ) . if @xmath23 is of order of typical strong interaction scale , @xmath24 gev , then , according to @xcite , the prediction is @xmath25 that is quite similar with the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "we consider also , as a second example , the phenomenological model @xcite , in which the shape of the charm pdf is sea - like , i.e. , similar to that of the light flavor sea quarks ( except for normalization ) .",
    "namely , for this case @xcite @xmath26    it is very important , for high energy cosmic ray physics , that the heavy constituents of an intrinsic heavy quark state , such as @xmath27 , usually carry the largest fraction of the nucleon s momentum .",
    "this can easily be shown in the context of light - cone models , where contributions of high - mass fock states ( to probability distributions , for example ) are suppressed only by energy denominator factor @xcite @xmath28",
    "^ { -2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath29 is a constituent number , @xmath30 are the light - cone momentum fractions , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is a particle s energy and @xmath33 is its longitudinal momentum ( i.e. , the momentum in a direction of the parent nucleon ) . evidently ,",
    "if @xmath34 is large , the value of @xmath35 should also be large , for far off - shell configurations not to be too suppressed .",
    "in two recent works @xcite the problem of a search of intrinsic charm was again considered in connection with experiments at rhic , lhc and tevatron . these authors argue that the hypothesis of intrinsic charm can be checked in these experiments ( studying the resulting transverse momentum spectra of charmed mesons ) . in the present paper",
    "we calculate inclusive distributions of charmed mesons ( @xmath0-spectra ) produced in @xmath36 collisions at high energies , using the mechanism proposed in @xcite ( based on the cgc formalism ) .",
    "we are interested in heavy meson production in @xmath37-collisions at very high energies and , what is most essential , at the projectile fragmentation region , i.e. , at forward rapidities . in the forward rapidity region",
    "the bjorken @xmath12 of the target nucleus has its lowest possible value for a given @xmath38 whereas the bjorken @xmath12 of the projectile is large ( close to unity ) .",
    "rescatterings of the projectile s quarks in a target are quite substantial . it had been shown in @xcite that a particle production in @xmath39-nucleus collisions at high energies and forward rapidities can be expressed through the cross section of a multiple scattering of a quark from the target nucleus which is treated as a color glass condensate . in this approach",
    "the projectile proton is considered as a collection of quarks and gluons ( according to the parton model ) , and the standard dglap evolution and collinear factorization are employed . the resulting formula @xcite for a single - inclusive charm production in @xmath37 collision is @xmath40 here , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath0 are the transverse momentum , rapidity and feynman @xmath12 of the produced @xmath43 meson , respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath44 is a momentum fraction of the charm quark of the projectile , @xmath45 is a momentum fraction of the target parton .",
    "the connection between @xmath45 and @xmath44 is @xmath46 and the rapidity is connected with @xmath0 , @xmath41 by the formula @xmath47 one can see from ( [ xa ] ) and ( [ xf ] ) that at large rapidities the @xmath45-values are small while @xmath44 is large .",
    "the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the proton charm pdf and the charm fragmentation function into @xmath43 mesons , respectively .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath50 is taken to be equal to @xmath51 .",
    "at last , the function @xmath52 is equal to an imaginary part of the quark - antiquark dipole - nucleus forward scattering amplitude , @xmath53 .",
    "this amplitude can be modelled by the following expression @xcite : @xmath54 . \\label{nf}\\ ] ] here , @xmath55 is the transverse size of the dipole , @xmath56 is the saturation scale ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a definition of @xmath57 ) , parameterized by the simple formula @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is a number of colours ( @xmath62 ) . for the `` anomalous dimension '' factor @xmath63 ( which enters eq .",
    "( [ nf ] ) due to quantum evolution in the color glass condensate ) , we use the parametrization from @xcite : @xmath64 where@xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "these parameters were fitted to the data of the rhic experiment @xcite where deuteron - gold collisions at forward rapidity ( i.e. , at the fragmentation region of the projectile ) were studied .",
    "one should note that just this region of rapidities is essential for calculations in cosmic ray physics .",
    "the formula ( [ dndd ] ) gives the spectrum of produced particles normalized on their average multiplicity in one collision .",
    "correspondingly , on vertical axes of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] - [ fig3 ] we present numbers of produced particles in the @xmath37-collision , in unit interval of @xmath0 .    for a calculation of the inclusive cross section one must multiply @xmath69 in ( [ dndd ] ) on a cross section of the collision , i.e. , on a transverse size of the target nucleus . to determine an approximate value of the proportionality coefficient , we note , firstly , that the cross section formula corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ dndd ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the dipole - nucleus cross section which , by optical theorem , is expressed through an imaginary part of the dipole - target forward scattering amplitude ( in @xmath55-representation ) : @xmath72 the fourier - bessel transformation relates @xmath73 with the amplitude in @xmath74-representation , introduced above , in eq .",
    "( [ nf ] ) : @xmath75 for the estimate of the proportionality coefficient , we use , for simplicity , the quasiclassical approximation , in which anomalous dimension factor , @xmath76 , is equal to @xmath77 . the approximate expression for the dipole cross section can be written as @xcite @xmath78 , \\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the gluon density in the nucleus , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are parameters .",
    "the expression ( [ sigma ] ) agrees , in the limit of small @xmath55 , with the leading twist perturbative qcd result .",
    "using , in the region @xmath84 , the definition of the saturation scale @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath85 the exponent in ( [ sigma ] ) can be rewritten in the form of ( [ nf ] ) ( with @xmath86 ) , if @xmath87 .",
    "one can easily check that the eq .",
    "( [ eqqs2 ] ) is not in contradiction with the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ qs1gev ] ) because one has , approximately , @xmath88    finally , it follows from these considerations that the coefficient , connecting @xmath89 and @xmath69 , is approximately equal to @xmath90 .",
    "it is known @xcite that , for a dipole - nucleon cross section , the value of @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is equal to @xmath91 mb .",
    "this value must be scaled according to the transverse area of the target nucleus . for the nucleus one has @xmath92fm , and for the nucleon one has @xmath93fm .    for the numerical calculations in the present paper we used the value of @xmath16 equal to @xmath94 having in mind that this value is close to the average atomic number of the nuclei in atmosphere . for @xmath95",
    "the proportionality coefficient is @xmath96",
    "for the concrete calculations we used the charm pdfs presented in @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite used for the presentation of pdfs at different values of the factorization scale the results of cteq group @xcite .",
    "for bhps model , it was assumed , in the present paper , that the charm content of the proton is on the maximal level , @xmath97 .",
    "the same is for the sea - like ic model : @xmath98 .    for applications in cosmic ray physics ( in particular , for calculations of atmospheric spectra of leptons ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) ) we need the dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath0 , so , we integrate ( [ dndd ] ) on @xmath41 and change the variables , using the relation @xmath100 the results of the calculations are shown in figures [ fig1 ] - [ fig4 ] .    the @xmath101 distributions of the @xmath102-quark fragmentation functions @xmath103 at their starting scales were assumed to obey the bowler parametrization @xcite , @xmath104 with three parameters @xmath61 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 . in the present paper",
    "we did not calculate the dglap evolution of fragmentation functions , and use ( [ dzmu ] ) for all values of @xmath107 .",
    "the concrete values of the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 were taken from the work @xcite , in which the nonperturbative fragmentation functions for @xmath43-mesons had been obtained by fitting experimental data on single - hadron inclusive production in @xmath108-annihilation obtained by belle , cleo , aleph and opal collaborations .    in figure [ fig1 ] the inclusive spectra of @xmath109-mesons for several values of cms - energy",
    "are shown ( for bhps model ) .",
    "it is seen that the steepness of the spectra strongly varies with @xmath0 : the relatively flat region ends at @xmath110 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] , where the comparison of the bhps and sea - like models results is given , shows that the form of @xmath0-spectrum is strongly model - dependent .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that the @xmath0-spectra for different charmed mesons are quite similar : the slight difference is connected , evidently , with the corresponding difference in pdfs of light sea antiquarks in the nucleon .",
    "inclusive cross sections of charmed mesons had been calculated in many works .",
    "we compare our results with the corresponding results of the most recent works @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite calculated the cross sections of inclusive @xmath11-pair production using the colour dipole - model approach @xcite ( and extrinsic charm ) .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are quite similar ; we compare our curves for @xmath111 gev and @xmath112 gev ( for bhps model ) with the corresponding curves of @xcite ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) . for this comparison",
    "we multiply our curves for @xmath99 on @xmath113 mb .",
    "the coefficient @xmath114 takes into account , approximately , the contribution of other @xmath43-mesons ( @xmath115 and @xmath10 ) . figure [ fig4 ] shows that the contribution of the intrinsic charm component can be relatively large and , in particular , sufficient for applications in cosmic - ray experiments .",
    "it follows from figure [ fig4 ] that in the tail region , @xmath116 , our curves are even steeper than those of @xcite , in spite of their `` intrinsic '' origin .",
    "one must bear in mind , however , that in the present paper inclusive spectra of charmed hadrons rather than @xmath11 pairs are calculated .",
    "naturally , a taking into account of the fragmentation of @xmath102 quarks into hadrons leads to additional steepening of @xmath0-spectra .",
