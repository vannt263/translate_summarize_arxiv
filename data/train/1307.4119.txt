    "searches for supersymmetry ( susy ) performed by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments on the center - of - mass energy @xmath5 tev run data have started to set stringent constraints to the strongly - interacting susy particles .",
    "they translate to limits on the susy masses up to @xmath6 tev for gluinos and squarks of the first family @xcite and @xmath7 gev for third generation squarks @xcite .",
    "comparatively weaker constraints were obtained for the states that can be only produced through electroweak ( ew ) interactions , such as sleptons , ew gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "the resulting bounds are up to @xmath8 gev for selectrons and smuons @xcite and up to @xmath9 gev for charginos @xcite .",
    "they often depend on the assumption of available on - shell decays .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that the lhc experiments have started  especially with the 2012 run data at @xmath10 tev  to go considerably beyond lep in testing the ew sector of the theory .",
    "such direct searches for ew production of susy particles are of major importance , as the ew - interacting particles can be in principle much lighter than the strongly - interacting ones .    in this paper , we want to discuss how the 8 tev run data constrain the parameter space that is compatible with a light neutralino as candidate for cold dark matter ( dm ) . in other words , we aim at answering the following question : how light can the lightest neutralino still be after the 8 tev run of the lhc ?    the framework we adopt for our study can be defined as follows :    * only the field content of the mssm is considered ; * dm is a thermal relic and a standard history of the universe is assumed ; * the abundance of the lightest mssm neutralino , whose stability is guaranteed by r - parity conservation , is required to not exceed the observed dm relic abundance .",
    "we are not going to make any assumption on the origin and the relations among the susy - breaking parameters : in particular we drop the hypothesis of gaugino mass unification that would imply the lower bound for the lightest neutralino mass reported by the pdg @xcite : @xmath11 .",
    "instead , we treat all susy soft - masses as free low - energy parameters .    as we discuss in the next section ,",
    "relic density constraints from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations identify the parameter space compatible with light neutralino dark matter and thus the features of the susy spectrum and the lhc phenomenology .",
    "in particular , we are going to argue that , under the assumptions listed above , neutralino dm with @xmath12 is only possible in a specific region of the supersymmetric parameter space , featuring relatively light staus and higgsinos .",
    "hence , searches based on multi - tau plus missing energy events are particularly promising in order to test such a scenario , as we are going to discuss in detail .",
    "a similar study has been presented last year in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we want to generalize the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , by considering a simplified model defined only by the subset of susy parameters relevant for the determination of the relic abundance .",
    "the rest of the spectrum is allowed to be heavy , so that our study is very conservative as it considers only ew production of staus and neutral and charged higgsinos . moreover , the atlas collaboration has recently performed a search for new physics in a final state with at least two taus and large missing transverse momentum @xcite , that we will translate into a stringent test of the light neutralino parameter space . at @xmath10 tev ,",
    "has been presented by cms  @xcite . the exclusion limit",

    "@xcite . ]    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : lightdm ] we qualitatively review the features of the parameter space compatible with light neutralino dm and we define the simplified model we are going to employ in the rest of the study . a quantitative discussion of the relevant constraints and the result of a numerical scan of the parameter space are presented in section [ sec : relicdensity ] , while bounds from direct and indirect dark matter searches are briefly discussed in [ sec : dmsearches ] .",
    "section [ sec : lhc_pheno ] is dedicated to a discussion of the spectrum of the light dm scenario and the consequences for susy searches at the lhc . in section [ sec : otherlhc ] , we discuss the indirect limits on the parameter space from invisible higgs decays and we show the possible impact of direct dm searches at the lhc in the monojet plus missing energy channel . in section [ sec : lhc_numerics ] , we present a monte carlo study reproducing the limits from ref .",

    "we conclude summarizing our results in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss how the parameter space of the mssm is constrained by the requirement of neutralino dark matter with @xmath13 gev .",
    "the first obvious condition is that , due to the lep bound on the chargino mass @xcite that implies for the wino and higgsino mass parameters @xmath14 gev , the lightest neutralino is mainly bino - like with the bino mass @xmath15 approximately : @xmath16 the other susy parameters depend strongly on how the dm relic density constraints are fulfilled and hence on the annihilation processes of the lightest neutralino in the early universe . in fact , a bino - like neutralino is typically overproduced in thermal processes so that an efficient annihilation mechanism is required in order to reproduce the observed relic density .",
    "there are mainly the following three categories for the annihilation mechanism that select different regions of the parameter space : ( i ) @xmath17-channel higgs mediation , ( ii ) co - annihilation with a light sfermion , ( iii ) @xmath18-channel sfermion mediation .",

    "several works have been recently dedicated to light neutralinos ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , aiming at a possible explanation of the annual modulation signal at dama / libra  @xcite and also reported by cogent  @xcite and the excess of nuclear recoil events observed by cogent itself and cresst  @xcite .",

    "direct detection experiments might still set relevant constraints on the region we are exploring , as there is an irreducible contribution to @xmath112 mediated by the exchange of the light higgs @xmath116 , whose coupling with the lightest neutralino is set by the relic density bound .",
    "other contributions , such as the squark - mediated ones , are model - dependent as they are controlled by parameters that are not constrained by @xmath117 .",
    "the calculation of the scattering cross - section is still affected by a residual model dependence , coming from the fact that the decoupling of the contribution mediated by the heavy cp - even higgs @xmath118 is very slow : in fact both @xmath116 and @xmath118 contributions are enhanced by a small value of @xmath37 ( that implies a large higgsino component in @xmath73 ) , though solely the @xmath118 contribution is enhanced by large @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , if one keeps , as in our scan , @xmath119 tev ( which might be a reasonable choice in the light of our susy spectrum ) and large values of @xmath96 ( as required by the relic density constraint ) , the size of the two contributions is comparable , and the si cross - section can be a powerful probe of the corner of the parameter space with small values of @xmath37 .",

    "let us now briefly discuss indirect detection limits .",

    "[ fig : dmsearches ] and it is compared with our parameter space prediction for the velocity - averaged annihilation cross - section ( weighted by @xmath125 ) as computed with micromegas .",
    "as we can see , the fermi - lat limit slightly increases the lower bound of the neutralino mass to about 13 gev .",
    "still , a conservative estimate of about @xmath126 of possible uncertainties affecting the theoretical computation and the experimental limit could easily make such a bound milder . nevertheless , the model predictions lie certainly on the border of the current fermi - lat sensitivity so that the light neutralino scenario might be tested independently in the near future by gamma - ray observations .",
    "a detailed discussion of experimental and theoretical uncertainties affecting direct and indirect dm searches is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "what we can conclude from this brief discussion is that direct and indirect dm searches are approaching the sensitivity for testing the light neutralino scenario , so that we can expect this to be achieved in the upcoming years , but at the moment we can conservatively consider most of our parameter space unconstrained by such searches .",
    "therefore , we are not going to impose the bounds from xenon100 and fermi - lat further in this study and concentrate on the constraints that can be obtained from the lhc data .",
    "as illustrated in the previous sections , light neutralino dm in the mssm is only consistent with wmap and planck observations in a region of the parameter space with peculiar features : a small soft mass for the right - handed stau , a small higgsino mass parameter @xmath37 and moderate to large @xmath96 .",
    "this leads us naturally to the following spectrum at the electroweak scale : besides the lightest neutralino that is assumed to have mass @xmath127 gev , there are only the lighter stau ( mainly right - handed ) , the higgsino - dominated neutralinos @xmath103 , and the lighter chargino @xmath52 , which take masses that are not much above @xmath128 gev .",
