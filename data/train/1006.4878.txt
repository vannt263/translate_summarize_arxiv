    "during recent years there has been a rapid increase in the interest of quantum plasmas , see e.g. , refs .",
    "this has been stimulated by experimental progress in nano - scale plasmas @xcite , ultracold plasmas @xcite , spintronics @xcite , and plasmonics @xcite .",
    "however , already more than forty years ago , iannuzzi @xcite established the possibility for the existence of electron spin ( paramagnetic ) resonance ( esr ) in a fully ionized low - temperature plasma , and predicted its importance , e.g. , in the plasma diagnostics for measuring the particle density with a greater precession than the conventional technique , in determining the particle velocity spectrum perpendicular to the magnetic field , as well as to calculate the magnetic field in the propagation of electromagnetic ( em ) waves ( e.g. , whistlers , alfvn waves , shock waves etc . ) in plasmas .",
    "recent investigation @xcite along this line indicates that besides the currently prevalent laser methods , esr technique can successfully be used for plasma diagnostics , e.g. , measuring the electron densities in the microwave region .",
    "furthermore , the importance of spin effects in plasmas has also been studied using kinetic plasma theory @xcite , with applications to wave propagation @xcite as well as other phenomena @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic description of spin plasma waves can also be found in the literature  ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although , whistler waves have been studied for almost a century , they are still a subject of intense research in view of its importance not only in space plasmas , but also in many astrophysical environments , e.g. , in the atmosphere of neutron star envelope , in the coherent radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere etc .",
    "quasilinear theory @xcite and simulation @xcite  show that whistler waves can be used to resonantly accelerate electrons .",
    "furthermore , they can also be used to interpret the fine structure of zebra - type patterns and fiber bursts in solar type ii and iv radio bursts @xcite .",
    "thus , the occurrence of esr might be useful for the electron acceleration in the propagation of em radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere as well as for plasma diagnostics in the microwave region in laboratory experiments if the conditions favor .    in the present work , we will derive and analyze the dispersion relation for the propagation of circularly polarized ( cp ) em  ( cpem ) waves in a magnetized spin plasma using a spin fluid model .",
    "various fluid models are appropriate in different regimes ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "the model to be used contains the bohm - de broglie potential , the magnetic dipole force and includes the spin - precession dynamics as well as the spin magnetization current .",
    "its basis can be found in e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and more rigorous foundation can be given starting from the kinetic theory presented in ref .",
    "specifically , we will focus our discussion to the esr as well as the properties of spin modified whistler - like modes .",
    "the nonrelativistic evolution of spin@xmath5 electrons can be described by @xcite @xmath6@xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 respectively represent the number density , mass and velocity of electrons , @xmath11 @xmath12 is the electric ( magnetic ) field , @xmath13 is the electron pressure . also , @xmath14 is the spin angular momentum with its absolute value @xmath15 @xmath16where @xmath17 is the electron @xmath18-factor and @xmath19 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the equations are then closed by the maxwell equations.@xmath20@xmath21 the above equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) apply when different spin states ( i.e. , spin - up and spin - down relative to the magnetic field ) can be well represented by a macroscopic average .",
    "this may occur for very strong magnetic fields ( or a very low temperature ) , where generally the lowest energy spin state is populated .",
    "alternatively , when the dynamics on a time - scale longer than the spin - flip frequency is considered , the macroscopic spin state is well - described by the thermodynamic equilibrium spin configuration , and the above model can still be applied . in the later case ,",
    "the macroscopic spin state will be attenuated by a ( thermodynamic ) factor decreasing the effective value of @xmath22 below @xmath23 . however ,",
    "this case will be not considered further in the present paper . as a consequence",
    ", our studies will be focused on the regime of strong magnetic fields , as seen in astrophysical plasmas @xcite .    in what follows , we will assume the propagation of a cpem waves to be of the form @xmath24 c.c .",
    ", along an external magnetic field @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the weakly modulated wave amplitude ( i.e. we assume @xmath27 , for all variables @xmath28 ) ,  @xmath29 @xmath30 represents the em wave number ( frequency ) and c.c . denotes the complex conjugate . in the interaction of high - frequency ( hf )",
    "em waves with the  hf electron plasma response , the use of cold plasma approximation is well justified in view of the fact that for large field intensities and moderate electron temperature , the directed velocity of electrons in the hf fields is much larger than the random thermal speed .",
    "moreover , it can also be shown that the density perturbation associated with the high - frequency ( hf ) em wave is zero .",
    "thus , taking the curl of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and using eqs .",
    "( [ 3])-([5 ] ) we readily obtain the following evolution equation for cpem waves .",
    "@xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\frac{2\\mu}{e\\hbar}\\partial_{t}\\left [   \\frac{1}{n_{e}}\\nabla\\times\\left ( \\nabla\\times n_{e}\\mathbf{s}\\right )   \\right ]   + \\frac{1}{m_{e}\\mu_{0}n_{e}% } \\nabla\\times\\left [   \\left (   \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{b}\\right )   \\times \\mathbf{b}\\right ]   + \\frac{2\\mu}{m_{e}\\hbar}\\nabla\\times\\left (   s^{a}\\nabla b_{a}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{m_{e}n_{e}}\\nabla\\times\\left (   \\partial _ { t}\\mathbf{e}\\times\\mathbf{b}\\right )   -\\frac{2\\mu}{m_{e}\\hbar n_{e}}% \\nabla\\times\\left [   \\left (   \\nabla\\times n_{e}\\mathbf{s}\\right ) \\times\\mathbf{b}\\right ]   \\label{ev}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the weakly nonlinear equation ( [ ev ] ) is a useful result when considering the interaction between low - frequency ( lf ) and hf fields , where the lf fields are induced by the ponderomotive force . equation ( [ ev ] ) then needs to be complemented by equations for the lf dynamics , and naturally the number of dependent variables can be further reduced .",
    "however , before this line of research is pursued , a more through study of the linear theory should be made , as will be undertaken in the next section .",
    "introducing the variables @xmath32 @xmath33 etc . , suitable for cp waves , and limiting ourselves to the linearized theory , we obtain respectively from the faraday s law and the spin - evolution equation @xcite . @xmath34 using eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) to express the free current as well as the magnetization current in terms of the electric field , and using eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , the following linear dispersion relation is obtained for the cpem modes @xmath35 which can be rewritten as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the refractive index , and where the upper and lower sign respectively stand for the left - hand circularly polarized ( lcp ) and right - hand circularly polarized ( rcp ) waves . also , @xmath38 is a frequency which involves the spin correction due to plasma magnetization current and @xmath39 is the electron skin - depth ( inertial length scale ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath40 , @xmath41and @xmath42  are respectively the electron plasma , cyclotron and the spin - precession frequency . in absence of the spin - magnetization , the well - known classical dispersion relation ,",
    "namely @xmath43 is recovered .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "the first and the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) appear due to the displacement current and the free electron current .",
    "the term involving @xmath44 appears even in absence of the external magnetic field , since the spin perturbation is due to the wave magnetic field not the constant field @xmath0 which does not provide any magnetic dipole force .",
    "note , however , that an unperturbed spin state with @xmath45 , that has been used in the derivation , typically requires that the external magnetic field is strong .",
    "thus , inclusion of the electron spin perturbation leads to a modification of the dispersion relation for transverse  plasma oscillations .",
    "this modification is clearly substantial when @xmath46 @xmath47 i.e. , when @xmath48for @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "this corresponds to a regime of very strong magnetic field in which the external field strength approaches or exceeds the quantum critical magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath51 @xmath52 in such a situation relativistic effects might be important .",
    "on the other hand , for the nonrelativistic motion of electrons we have @xmath53 i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath54 for @xmath55 @xmath56 . in this case , the density regime in which the magnetic field is ` nonquantizing ' and does not affect the thermodynamic properties of the electron gas , is @xmath57m@xmath4 and the temperature @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "thus , in the strong magnetic field and highly dense plasmas , the electron spin effect can no longer be neglected , rather it modifies the wave dispersion leading to new eigenmodes .",
    "inspecting now the term @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) , we note that @xmath61 so , the spin current can be much larger than the classical free current when @xmath62this basically holds when either ( i ) @xmath63 @xmath64 or ( ii ) @xmath53 @xmath65and @xmath66 is satisfied .",
    "the case of @xmath67 is rather less important , as it does not give rise to wave propagation ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "also , in the very lf regime @xmath69 the ion motion can be of importance , and we will therefore not consider that case .",
    "thus , one important mode could be the rcp lf ( @xmath70 ) em waves ( whistlers ) .",
    "let us now see how the dispersion relation reduces when either of the two cases is considered . in the limit of @xmath71 ,",
    "the dispersion equation ( [ 7 ] ) reduces to @xmath72 from which one finds for @xmath73 a purely spin - modified frequency @xmath74 . also ,",
    "if @xmath75 and @xmath76 we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 the frequencies @xmath79 may correspond to the spin waves in ferromagnets under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "figure 1 displays the modes for rcp waves obtained as numerical solutions of the dispersion equation . evidently , there exist two eigenmodes apart from a hf ( @xmath80 one , namely a mode close to the electron - cyclotron or spin - precession frequency , and the other one is the lf mode below the cyclotron frequency .",
    "in contrast to the hf modes , the spin modified lf modes propagate with the frequency below that in the classical case . on the other hand , in the very hf regime ( @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 and",
    "so we have @xmath84 , which is the dispersion relation of a em wave in vacuum .",
    "evidently , since @xmath68 for @xmath85 there must exist an intermediate frequency @xmath86 at which the solution for @xmath82 must pass through a zero value , and becomes positive again .",
    "thus , the cut - off frequencies for which @xmath87 are obtained as @xmath88 where @xmath89 stand for rcp and lcp waves respectively .",
    "clearly , the rcp waves have lower cut - off frequency than the lcp modes . on the other hand , the resonances for the rcp waves (",
    "@xmath90 associated with both the orbital and the spin - gyration , occur ( lcp mode  has no resonance ) as either @xmath91 or @xmath92 i.e. , when the angular frequency of the wave electric field matches either due to electron cyclotron motion ( cyclotron resonance ) or due to the intrinsic spin of electrons ( esr ) . at the resonance ,",
    "the transverse field associated with the rcp wave rotates at the same velocity as electrons gyrate around @xmath93 the electrons thus experiences a continuous acceleration from the wave electric field , which tends to increase their perpendicular energy .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that rcp waves propagating along the the external magnetic field and oscillating at the cyclotron frequency or spin - precession frequency are absorbed  by electrons",
    ". this may be the consequence to the recently developed experiment based on microwave absorption and the esr to be successfully used for plasma diagnostics @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since the spin effect is appreciable in the strongly magnetized dense plasmas , the esr could well be relevant for the coherent em radiation in pulsar magnetosphere or magnetized white dwarfs .    )",
    "are shown with respect to the normalized wave number and frequency for @xmath94 , @xmath95,width=384,height=288 ]    ) is plotted as a function of the normalized wave frequency for the rcp waves with the same set of parameters as in fig . 1 . , width=384,height=288 ]",
    "let us now see how the group speed @xmath96 of the cp waves is modified with the spin correction .",
    "we obtain from the dispersion relation [ eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) ] @xmath97 where  @xmath98 and @xmath99 are given by @xmath100 clearly , the lf @xmath101 component of  a pulse ( whistlers ) propagates more slowly than the hf @xmath102 components as is evident from fig .",
    "it follows that by the time a pulse returns to a ground level it has been stretched out temporarily , because the hf component of the pulse arrives slightly before the lf components .",
    "this also accounts for the characteristic whistling down - effect observed at ground level .",
    "moreover , the group speed @xmath103 of the whistlers increases in the frequency regime @xmath104 and decreases in the other subinterval @xmath105 before it reaches the maximum nearer the resonance point .",
    "however , the group speed of the hf modes approaches the speed of light as @xmath106 @xmath107 increases and gets saturated at large @xmath108 from fig .",
    "2 we also note that the spin force reduces the group speed in strongly magnetized dense plasmas .",
    "to summarize ,  the dispersion relation for the propagation of hf cpem waves is obtained in a magnetized spin plasma .",
    "the electron spin modifies the plasma current density and thereby introduces a correction term in the dispersion relation , which , in turn , gives rise a new  cp hf mode .",
    "the spin effects are seen to be substantial in the very strong magnetic field @xmath109 and highly dense plasmas @xmath110 where the relativistic effects might be important .",
    "however , in nonrelativistic plasmas , the spin of electrons can also be important in the case @xmath111 together with @xmath112 in particular , when the spin current dominates over the classical free current the rcp em waves resonantly interact with the electrons only at the spin - precession frequency .",
    "such resonance should be helpful for particle acceleration in the coherent radio emission of the pulsar magnetosphere or magnetized white dwarfs .",
    "the study of the spin modified modes might also be important at least from the diagnostic points of view , since the observation of the propagation characteristics of the wave modes may be used in order to determine the physical parameters in plasmas @xcite .",
    "lastly , the electron spin - resonance ( esr ) could be an important consequence to the recently developed experiment for plasma diagnostics in the microwave region , if the conditions favor @xcite .",
