    "we first consider the structure of a giant vortex of charge @xmath9 for @xmath2 and begin with simple estimates .",

    "( [ gl1],[gl2 ] ) consists in solving a two - point boundary value problem ( at @xmath54 and @xmath52 ) and can be achieved using several methods @xcite .",
    "shooting is generally easy to implement and robust when one mode needs to be cancelled at a boundary : a free parameter is adjusted ( for example by dichotomy ) at the other boundary until the required cancellation is obtained . in the present case ,",
    "two diverging modes need to be cancelled at infinity which is more difficult to achieve .",
    "we kept a simple one parameter shooting by integrating from a large @xmath72 toward @xmath54 . of the two free parameters at @xmath73 one was used to cancel the diverging mode at @xmath54 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 at @xmath74 was then given as a function of the other parameter ( which could be adjusted to obtain a particular value of @xmath9 when desired ) .",
    "we also implemented a relaxation method .",
    "the system of ordinary differential equations is replaced by a set of finite difference equations satisfied on a mesh of points , and the boundary conditions just appear as equations satisfied by the points located at the extremities of the mesh .",
    "a multi - dimensional version of newton s method provides a solution of these finite difference equations by an iterative procedure .",
    "this method requires the inversion of a matrix of size proportional to the number of points in the mesh .",
    "because this matrix is block diagonal , it can be inverted in a very efficient manner .",
    "however , the efficiency of the relaxation method depends strongly on the starting point of the iteration : for example , it is useful to take the profile of a @xmath9-vortex as an initial guess for the @xmath75-vortex solution of the ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "numerical solutions for different values of @xmath9 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the plot of @xmath42 shows a well - defined interface between a normal region ( where @xmath76 ) and a superconducting region @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "the interface width does not increase with @xmath9 but remains of the order of @xmath78 . as expected , the interface has a well - defined limiting shape : in fig .  1b , the curves represented in fig .",
    "1a are shifted in such a way that they take the value @xmath79 at the point @xmath80 .",
    "the shifted curves superpose on one another almost perfectly .",
    "only the curve for the small value @xmath81 shows a noticeable deviation from the limiting shape .    the simple normal / superconducting interface picture for @xmath2 is also confirmed by the graphs of @xmath39 . in fig .  [ bfig ] , @xmath82 is plotted for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic induction is close to @xmath83 in the vortex interior and quickly decreases to zero in the interface region .",
    "again , in the large @xmath9 limit , the curves can be put over one another by the same shifts as those used to superpose the different @xmath42 s in fig .",
    "it is instructive to see how the large-@xmath9 giant vortex structure arises in a direct analysis of the ginzburg - landau equations ( [ gl1],[gl2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath84 at @xmath54 one expects @xmath39 to be of order @xmath9 in a whole region near @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , at dominant order in @xmath9 , eq .  ( [ gl1 ] ) for @xmath42 reduces to @xmath85 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ fcore ] ) can be obtained in a wkb manner but",

    "the solution ( [ gcore ] ) vanishes for @xmath88 and therefore the assumption @xmath89 under which it was derived breaks down at the interface .",
    "a different simplification of the ginzburg - landau equations can be made in the vicinity of @xmath57 .",
    "we define a new variable @xmath90 , centered around @xmath57 , such that @xmath91 we assume ( and will verify at the end ) that @xmath92 . substituting ( [ shiftvar ] ) into ( [ gl1],[gl2 ] )",

    "actually , the expression ( [ petitordre1 ] ) for @xmath42 is sufficient for this purpose ( the range where it is not valid gives an exponentially small contribution ) and by performing the integral over modified bessel functions , one obtains @xmath256 .",
    "a similar procedure can be carried out for the second order terms .",
    "the expressions for @xmath235 and @xmath236 are more intricate and are given in appendix b. using eq .",

    "it is indeed well - known that at this ` dual ' point the second order ginzburg - landau equations reduce to first order equations , leading to special relations between the functions @xmath261 and @xmath262 . moreover ,",
    "the free energy at the dual point has been calculated exactly and is identical to the topological number @xmath9 .",
    "we recall briefly these special properties .    at the dual point",
    "the free energy ( [ free2 ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath263 the minimal free energy is obtained when the following first order system is satisfied ( bogomolnyi equations @xcite ) : @xmath264 substituting ( [ bogo1 ] ) and ( [ bogo2 ] ) in ( [ freebogo ] ) we obtain the minimal energy @xmath265 equation ( [ bogo2 ] ) implies that @xmath266    another remarkable consequence of the bogomolnyi equations is that the surface energy @xmath137 , defined in ( [ energsurface ] ) , vanishes identically and changes its sign at the dual point ( this is the reason why the dual point separates type i from type ii superconductors @xcite ) : @xmath267    all the calculations that we have carried out in the previous sections are consistent with these ( non - perturbative ) properties of the dual point . in the small @xmath9 case of section 5 , one can verify , using ( [ petitordre1 ] ) and the expressions given in the appendix , that the equations ( [ bogo1 ] , [ bogo2 ] ) are satisfied order by order by the expansions ( [ 0expansion ] ) of @xmath42 and @xmath39 at the dual point .",

    ", the vortices do not interact and the free energy does not depend upon their location .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain exact @xmath9-vortices solutions , in the large @xmath9 limit , for arbitrary locations of the vortex cores @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath1 deviates from the special value @xmath271 , vortices start interacting and their interaction energy is extremal when all the vortices are located at the same point .",
    "we now evaluate the energy of such a configuration with cylindrical symmetry when @xmath1 is close to the dual point .",
    "we apply our results to the case where @xmath1 is close to the dual point value @xmath272 in experiments on mesoscopic superconductors , values of @xmath1 are close to the dual point value @xcite and in previous theoretical studies the special case @xmath273 was found to be very useful to study analytically the magnetization of a sample as a function of the applied field . in the vicinity of the dual point ,",
    "a relevant quantity is the relative growth of the free energy : @xmath274 this relation is a local form of an empirical scaling of the free energy @xmath275 found in @xcite , where the exponents @xmath276 were computed numerically . differentiating the ginzburg - landau free energy ( [ free2 ] ) with respect to the parameter @xmath1 at the dual point",

    ". hence we can expand ( [ identitealp3 ] ) using the local variable @xmath143 and in the large @xmath9 limit replace @xmath42 by @xmath108 ( as in section 3.5 ) : @xmath280 integrating the last term by parts , we obtain : @xmath281 in the last equality we used the fact that the functions @xmath108 and @xmath104 satisfy the following bogomolnyi equations at the dual point @xcite : @xmath282 the function @xmath283 defined by @xmath284 satisfies a second order differential equation that can be solved explicitely @xcite : @xmath285 now changing the variable @xmath90 to @xmath283 , we rewrite the last integral in ( [ ippsi ] ) as @xmath286 substituting this result in ( [ devptalpha ] ) and knowing that @xmath287 exactly ( [ r0dual ] ) , we find an asymptotic expansion for @xmath276 in the large @xmath9 limit : @xmath288 we have not calculated the subleading behaviour of the free energy but our numerical results provide an estimate of the higher order term in ( [ ordre1 ] ) : @xmath289 from ( [ ordre1 ] ) and ( [ defalpha ] ) , the expansion of the free energy near @xmath11 is found .",
    "this allows us to retrieve , using ( [ approxa ] ) , the local behaviour of the surface energy in the vicinity of the dual point , first calculated by dorsey @xcite : @xmath290    in the same way , from the small @xmath9 expansion of the free energy up to the second order , we derive that ( see appendix b ) : @xmath291 we have computed numerically from ( [ defalpha ] ) the function @xmath276 for @xmath9 ranging from 1 to 250 and some significant values are given in table 1 .",
