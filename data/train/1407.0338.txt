    "the meaning of the sum uncertainty relation is that mixing different operators always decreases the uncertainty .",
    "the lower bound in can be rewritten using vaidman s formula @xcite @xmath105 ( the expectation value @xmath21 and the variance @xmath106 of the observable @xmath22 are calculated on @xmath5 ) , obtaining @xmath107 gives .",
    "using the results of @xcite it is also easy to extend this inequality to more than two observables .",
    "we now show that the optimization over @xmath10 of both inequalities and makes them tight .",

    "we find @xmath111\\times\\labell{d10}\\\\&&\\nonumber ( a\\pm ib)|\\psi\\>/{\\cal n}=(\\delta a^2+\\delta b^2\\pm i\\<[a , b]\\>)/{\\cal n } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the normalization constant is @xmath112\\>)^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "substituting into , we see that the inequality is indeed saturated .",
    "analogous considerations hold for : in this case , we should choose @xmath113 . with this choice , @xmath114\\>/(\\delta a\\delta b)$ ] , which is also equal to the square of the normalization constant for @xmath10 .",
    "hence , substituting this value in , we see that it is saturated for this choice of @xmath10 .",
    "[ it is also clear that the choice of @xmath10 that minimizes the lower bounds transforms into @xmath27\\>|$ ] that is a consequence of as shown above , and it transforms into . ]",
    "a simple prescription for how to choose an expression for @xmath10 uses , namely @xmath115 .",
    "here we have focused on extending the heisenberg - robertson uncertainty relation , but it is also possible to give an extension to the schrdinger relation , by choosing an arbitrary phase factor @xmath116 in place of the imaginary constant @xmath33 in .",
    "recently , there has been an interesting and lively debate on how to interpret the uncertainty principle @xcite . to elucidate the relation between these results and ours , we introduce peres nomenclature that distinguishes between uncertainty _ relation _ and uncertainty _ principle _ @xcite .",
    "the former refers solely to the preparation of the system which induces a spread in the measurement outcomes , and does not refer to the disturbance induced by the measurement or to joint measurements . and @xmath117 is the following : if the same preparation procedure is repeated many times , and is followed either by a measurement of @xmath118 , or by a measurement of @xmath119 , the various results obtained for @xmath118 and for @xmath119 have standard deviations , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , whose product can not be less than @xmath122 .",
    "there never is any question here that a measurement of @xmath118 disturbs the value of @xmath119 and vice - versa , as sometimes claimed .",
    "these measurements are indeed incompatible , but they are performed on _ different _ particles ( all of which were identically prepared ) and therefore these measurements can not disturb each other in any way . the uncertainty relation [ ... ]",
    "only reflects the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes of quantum tests . ''",
    "we emphasize that the uncertainty _ relation _ must not be confused with the uncertainty _",
    "principle_. ] the latter entails also the measurement disturbance by the apparatus and the impossibility of joint measurements of incompatible observables . from robertson",
    "s derivation @xcite , it is clear @xcite that the heisenberg - robertson inequalities are uncertainty _ relations _ ( the ones typically taught in textbooks ) . in contrast , heisenberg in his paper @xcite does not give a clear distinction between the two concepts , and both can be applied depending on the systems he analyzes there . the recent literature",
    "@xcite discusses the uncertainty _",
    "principle _ : measurement - induced disturbance and joint measurability .",
    "our result instead refers to uncertainty _ relations _ :",
    "it can be seen as a quantitative expression for the nonexistence of common eigenstates in incompatible observables .",
    "the heisenberg - robertson or schrdinger uncertainty relations do not fully capture the incompatibility of observables on the system state . in this paper",
    ", we have presented a stronger uncertainty relation based on two lower bounds and for the sum of the variances that are nontrivial if the two observables are incompatible on the state of the system .",
    "we also derived , a strengthening of the heisenberg - robertson uncertainty relation .",
    "there exists alternate formulations of uncertainty relations in terms of bounds on the sum of _ entropic _ quantities @xcite , but our new relations capture the notion of incompatibilty in terms of experimentally measured error bars , as they refer to variances .",
