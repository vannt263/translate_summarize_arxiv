    "indentation tests have been used for decades to identify mechanical properties of articular cartilage @xcite and to assess its viability @xcite .",
    "there is a wide variety of indentations tests and their possible applications .",
    "first of all , indentation tests can be classified with respect to the type of indenter used ( cylindrical flat - ended , spherical , etc . ) . in the simplest case of cylindrical indenter ,",
    "the contact area is supposed to remain constant during the indentation process , and only two mechanical variables , namely , the contact force , @xmath0 , and the indenter displacement , @xmath1 , can be recorded as functions of time during the depthsensing indentation .",
    "second , indentation tests can be viewed according to the main mechanical parameter determined ( e.g. , short - time bulk modulus @xcite , indentation stiffness @xcite , pulsatile dynamic stiffness @xcite ) that , of course , depends on the mathematical model employed .",
    "for instance , the derivative @xmath2 is known as the indentation stiffness , and will be a variable quantity for time - dependent materials like articular cartilage .",
    "third , indentation tests can be classified according to protocol types ( e.g. , multiple ramp - and - hold protocol for creep test @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the time - history of loading is important . finally ,",
    "depending on the primary variable parameter chosen , one can distinguish displacement - controlled or load - controlled indentation tests , when @xmath1 or @xmath0 is assumed to be controlled , respectively .",
    "in particular , linear and non - linear monotonic displacement - controlled and force - controlled indentation loading paths were considered recently by @xcite .    in their recent paper ,",
    "@xcite employed a hybrid - type test consisting of two stages , one of which is displacement - controlled , while the other can be regarded as load - controlled . in the present note ,",
    "we apply the viscoelastic layer model for evaluating the so - called rebound indentation test and clarifying its applicability for assessing viability of articular cartilage .",
    "we consider a cylindrical , flat - ended indentation test , which is composed of two stages . in the first stage , called the indentation phase , the sample is subject to loading at a constant speed @xmath3 to achieve an indentation depth of @xmath4 .",
    "that is the indenter displacement is assumed to be specified according to the law @xmath5 the maximum indenter displacement at the end of the first stage is given by @xmath6 hence , specifying the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we obtain the duration of the first stage @xmath7 .",
    "note that instead of an imposed maximum displacement , @xmath4 , @xcite operated with a prescribed value of maximum strain ( deformation ) @xmath8 , which depends on the layer sample thickness @xmath9 .",
    "further , we assume that at the indentation depth @xmath4 the load is immediately removed and the second stage , called the recovery phase , lasts for a theoretically indefinite time . in the recovery phase",
    ", we have @xmath10    we distinguish in the notation the displacements , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the contact loads , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , corresponding to aforementioned two test stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the function @xmath11 is specified by eq .",
    "( [ 1jt(2.1 ) ] ) , while @xmath13 is unknown . on the contrary ,",
    "the displacement function @xmath12 is unknown , whereas the contact load @xmath14 is specified by eq .",
    "( [ 1jt(2.3 ) ] ) , in the second stage .",
    "let us assume that an articular cartilage sample may be modeled as a viscoelastic layer of thickness @xmath9 bonded to a rigid substrate . for the sake of simplicity , we neglect friction and assume that poisson s ratio , @xmath15 , of the layer material is time independent .",
    "these are standard assumptions made in most of the mathematical models .",
    "then , based on the solution to the elastic contact problem of frictionless indentation of an elastic layer @xcite and applying the elastic - viscoelastic correspondence principle @xcite , one can arrive at the following equation between the indenter displacement @xmath1 and the applied force @xmath0 : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the contact radius , @xmath18 is a dimensionless factor accounting the thickness effect through the ratio @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 is the relaxation modulus , @xmath21 is the time variable , @xmath22 is the time moment just preceding the initial moment of contact .",
    "it has been tacitly assumed that @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ 1jt(1.3 ) ] ) was previously used in a number of studies @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be the relaxed elastic modulus , that is the limit of modulus @xmath20 at @xmath26 .",
    "taking into account the relation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the relaxation function , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 1jt(1.3 ) ] ) in the following form : @xmath29 considering eq .",
    "( [ 1jt(1.6 ) ] ) as an integral equation with respect to @xmath1 , one arrives at the inverse relationship @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the creep function . with the appropriate relaxation function @xmath28 and creep function @xmath31 , eqs .",
    "( [ 1jt(1.6 ) ] ) and ( [ 1jt(1.7 ) ] ) can be used in the general case of viscoelastic solid .    in the indentation phase , according to eqs .",
    "( [ 1jt(2.1 ) ] ) and ( [ 1jt(1.6 ) ] ) , we will have @xmath32 the maximum contact load @xmath33 is given by @xmath34    in the recovery phase , in accordance with eq .",

    "the derivative @xmath38 entering the first integral in ( [ 1jt(4.3 ) ] ) can be computed by differentiating the both sides of eq .",
    "( [ 1jt(4.1 ) ] ) .",
    "thus , taking also into account eq .",

    "if the layer s material follows a linear standard three - parameter viscoelastic solid model , we will have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the characteristic relaxation time of strain under applied step of stress , @xmath42 is the ratio of the relaxed elastic modulus @xmath25 ( the limit of modulus @xmath20 at @xmath26 ) to the unrelaxed elastic modulus @xmath43 ( modulus @xmath20 at @xmath44 ) , i.e. , @xmath45 .    according to eq",

    "following @xcite , we determine the rebound strain , @xmath49 , as the relative elastic reverse displacement that the viscoelastic layer recoves to from the moment of unloading . in other words",

    "the experimental points depicted in fig .",
    "[ figurer2.pdf ] were obtained by @xcite in the indentation tests with a relative large maximum indentation strain of 30 per cent .",
    "based on ( [ 1jt(3.2z2 ) ] ) , we make use of the following formula @xmath57 with three fitting parameters @xmath55 , @xmath58 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the results of the least - squares best fit of the analytical expression ( [ 1jt(3.2z3 ) ] ) to the experimental data are as follows : @xmath59 , @xmath60  s , @xmath61 ( normal cartilage ) and @xmath62 , @xmath63  s , @xmath64 ( artificially degraded cartilage ) .",
    "it should be noted that in the both cases , the values of parameter @xmath58 are different from @xmath65 ( which is the experimentally imposed maximum strain @xmath66 ) . in other words ,",
    "the cartilage samples do not show complete recovery .",
    "further , the characteristic relaxation time @xmath41 is found to decrease with degradation .",
    "such a tendency is in agreement with that obtained by @xcite in the shear creep test for human articular cartilage .",
    "in the present study , the rebound indentation test has been evaluated in the framework of viscoelastic layer model . for the contact force @xmath13 in the displacement controlled stage and for the indentation displacement @xmath12 in the load - controlled stage , the closed - form analytical expressions ( [ 1jt(4.1 ) ] ) and ( [ 1jt(4.4 ) ] ) , respectively , have been derived for an arbitrary viscoelastic solid model .    in the case of standard viscoelastic solid model ,",
    "a simple exponential behavior was established for the rebound displacement @xmath12 ( see eq .",

    "the main finding of the present study is that the rebound displacement @xmath12 does not depend on the layer material constants @xmath25 and @xmath15 as well as on the layer s thickness @xmath9 . at the same time",
