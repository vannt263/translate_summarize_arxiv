    "common belief holds that only polynomial interactions up to a certain degree depending on the spacetime dimension are renormalizable , in the sense that interactions of even higher order require an infinite number of subtractions in a perturbative analysis .",
    "this can be attributed to the implicit assumption that the higher - order couplings , which in general are dimensionful , set independent scales .",
    "such nonrenormalizable theories can only be defined with a cutoff scale @xmath1 , while the unknown physics beyond the cutoff is encoded in the ( thereby independent ) values of the couplings .",
    "starting from the viewpoint that the cutoff @xmath1 is the only scale in the theory , halpern and huang @xcite pointed out the existence of theories with higher - order and even nonpolynomial interactions within the conventional setting of quantum field theory .",
    "this happens because the higher - order couplings , by assumption , are proportional to a corresponding power of @xmath2 and therefore die out sufficiently fast in the limit @xmath3 ; the theories remain perturbatively renormalizable in the sense that infinitely many subtractions are not required . perhaps most important",
    ", halpern and huang so discovered nonpolynomial scalar theories which are asymptotically free , offering an escape route to the `` problem of triviality '' of standard scalar theories @xcite .    to be more precise , halpern and huang analyzed the renormalization group ( rg ) trajectories for the interaction potential in the vicinity of the gaussian fixed point .",
    "the exact form of the potential was left open by using a taylor series expansion in the field as an ansatz . employing the wegner - houghton @xcite ( sharp - cutoff ) formulation of the wilsonian rg , the eigenpotentials ,",
    "i.e. , tangential directions to the rg trajectories at the gaussian fixed point , were identified in linear approximation .",
    "while the standard polynomial interactions turn out to be irrelevant as expected , some nonpolynomial potentials which increase exponentially for strong fields prove to be relevant perturbations at the fixed point .",
    "for the irrelevant interactions , the gaussian fixed point is infrared ( ir ) stable , whereas the relevant ones approach this fixed point in the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "possible applications of these new relevant directions are discussed in @xcite for the higgs model and in @xcite for quintessence .",
    "further nonpolynomial potentials and their applications in higgs and inflationary models have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "considering the complete rg flow of such asymptotically free theories from the uv cutoff @xmath1 down to the infrared , the halpern - huang result teaches us only something about the very beginning of the flow close to the cutoff and thereby close to the gaussian fixed point .",
    "each rg step in a coarse - graining sense `` tends to take us out of the linear region into unknown territory '' @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to perform a first reconnaissance of this territory with the aid of the rg flow equations for the `` effective average action '' @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the standard effective action @xmath4 is considered as the zero - ir - cutoff limit of the effective average action @xmath5 $ ] which is a type of coarse - grained free energy with a variable infrared cutoff at the mass scale @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 satisfies an exact renormalization group equation , and interpolates between the classical action @xmath8 and the standard effective action @xmath9 .    in this work , we identify the classical action @xmath10 given at the cutoff @xmath1 with a scalar o(@xmath0 ) symmetric theory defined by a standard kinetic term and a generally nonpolynomial potential of halpern - huang type .",
    "therefore , we have the following scenario in mind : at very high energy , the system is at the uv stable gaussian fixed point . as the energy decreases , the system undergoes an ( unspecified ) perturbation which carries it away from the fixed point initially into some tangential direction to one of all possible rg trajectories .",
    "we assume that this perturbation occurs at some scale @xmath1 which then sets the only dimensionful scale of the system .",
    "any other ( dimensionless ) parameter of the system should also be determined at @xmath1 ; for the halpern - huang potentials , there are two additional parameters : one labels the different rg trajectories ; the other specifies the `` distance '' scale along the trajectory .",
    "finally , the precise form of the potential at @xmath1 serves as the boundary condition for the rg flow equation which governs the behavior of the theory at all scales @xmath11 .    since the rg flow equations for @xmath7 are equivalent to an infinite number of coupled differential equations of first order , a number of approximations ( truncations ) are necessary to arrive at explicit solutions .",
    "in the present work , we shall determine the rg trajectory @xmath12 for @xmath13 $ ] explicitly only in the large-@xmath0 limit which simplifies the calculations considerably .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",

    "but since the cutoff scale @xmath1 , though large , is not at all infinitesimally separated from the gaussian fixed point , this tangential approximation is probably not sufficient to stay on the true renormalized trajectory during the shift . not only the tangent but also all ( infinitely many ) curvature moments of the trajectory had to be known in order to find an initial point right on the renormalized trajectory at @xmath1 .",
    "this point would correspond to a so - called `` perfect action '' @xcite .",
    "of course , this requires an infinite number of conditions to be imposed on the initial action at @xmath1 which we can not specify . in conventional field theories ,",
    "this problem is solved by adjusting ( fine - tuning ) the initial action close to the unstable gaussian fixed point , leaving open only one a priori chosen relevant direction to the flow .",
    "but in the present case , there is an infinite number of relevant directions corresponding to the continuum of possible halpern - huang directions , and thus it seems impossible to single out only one relevant direction while frustrating the others by tuning infinitely many parameters . in other words , upon studying the flow from @xmath1 down to zero within our scenario , the continuum limit of our system remains unspecified , and therefore one important ingredient to a complete field theoretic system is missing .    with these reservations in mind , we nevertheless believe that there are some lessons to be learned from the application of the rg flow equations to such potentials .",

    "since @xmath120 sets the distance scale on the rg trajectory , the demand for a small value of @xmath120 is consistent with our scenario : if we leave the gaussian fixed point with a very tiny perturbation @xmath174 at the high - energy scale @xmath1 , it is only _ natural _ to arrive at a low - energy theory with a similarly tiny mass compared to the cutoff .",
    "moreover , consistency of our scenario requires @xmath120 to be small in order to justify the linearization of the flow equation in deriving the halpern - huang result .",
    "to summarize , the symmetry - preserving halpern - huang potential qualitative does not change its form during the flow into the infrared ; in particular , no symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "only the slope of the potential at the origin of the theory increases for @xmath142 , which corresponds to a mass renormalization .",

    "[ lnhh ] we learned that the position of the minimum of the halpern - huang potentials in the large-@xmath0 limit is independent of the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath175 : @xmath176 , or in dimensionful quantities : @xmath177 .",
    "according to the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , the halpern - huang potentials are `` fine - tuned '' in the sense that the minimum vanishes exactly in the infrared limit @xmath113 : @xmath178 therefore , there is no symmetry breaking in the full quantum theory of halpern - huang potentials in the large-@xmath0 limit .",

    "( [ 26 ] ) and obtain the transcendental equation in @xmath15 : @xmath182 here we can read off that @xmath183 is always smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "this reflects the approach to convexity of the inner part of the effective potential .    to summarize , we have found , on the one hand , that the originally nontrivial minimum of the potential moves to the origin during the flow ; the inner region of the potential shrinks to a point . on the other hand , we know from the preceding subsection that the potential wall at @xmath184 does not change its position under the flow .",
    "it remains to be investigated what happens in between the minimum and the potential wall .",
    "unfortunately , we can not answer this question by the large-@xmath0 version of the flow equation , because we do not have a boundary condition for this region . at the cutoff @xmath80 , the inner region borders directly at the potential wall ; hence , there is no `` in - between '' that could serve as a boundary condition .",
    "of course , it is plausible to assume that the potential may interpolate smoothly between the origin with zero slope and the potential wall at @xmath185 with infinite slope .",
    "but alternatively , the potential can also remain flat for @xmath186 $ ] , resembling a particle - in - a - box potential .",

    "in the present paper , we have investigated the rg flow of particular nonpolynomial potentials for o(@xmath0 ) symmetric scalar theories using the effective - average - action method .",
    "these halpern - huang potentials arise from small relevant perturbations at the gaussian fixed point as tangential directions to the rg flow . apart from serious , unresolved problems with the continuum limit of these potentials",
    ", we were able to follow the flow from a given ultraviolet scale @xmath1 down to the nonperturbative infrared ; for this , a number of approximations have been made which are only under limited control . in a first step ,",
    "we have neglected the influence of possible derivative couplings on the flow of the potential .    secondly",
    ", assuming that the anomalous dimension is only weakly dependent on @xmath6 and bounded , the qualitative features of the flow could already be guessed from the form of the flow equation : this is because the exponential increase of the potentials essentially causes the flow to stop for large enough field values .",
    "therefore , the form of the potentials was recognized as stiff under the flow ; only the loose ends of the potential near the origin or possible extrema make room for more diversified behavior .",
    "these considerations have been verified explicitly in the large-@xmath0 limit of the system . in this limit , the exponential increase of the potentials is represented by a potential wall .",
    "the potential close to the wall and the wall itself remain unchanged even in the far infrared .",
    "those potentials with an o(@xmath0 ) symmetric ground state ( @xmath118 ) at the cutoff preserve this symmetry down to @xmath113 .",
    "our main result for such potentials is summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) , ( [ 30 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) , where the particular form of the mass renormalization is stated .",
    "contrary to polynomial scalar interactions where the mass varies @xmath194 during the flow , the halpern - huang potentials exhibit corrections which are governed by the rg distance parameter @xmath120 .",
    "in particular , if one demands that a renormalized ( infrared ) mass differ by several orders of magnitude from the cutoff scale @xmath1 , the bare parameters of a _ polynomial _ theory at the cutoff scale have to be fine - tuned accurately to several decimal places .",
    "by contrast , to achieve such a separation of mass scales with a _ nonpolynomial _ halpern - huang potential , an adjustment of the rg distance parameter at the cutoff to some small value is required with much less precision .",
    "additionally , the smallness of this value arises naturally , if the ( unknown ) perturbation at the gaussian fixed point is tiny .",
    "the ( symmetry - preserving ) halpern - huang potentials thus has no problem of _",
    "naturalness_. owing to the general properties of the complete flow equation mentioned above , we believe that these properties of the symmetry - preserving potentials in the large-@xmath0 limit also hold for finite values of @xmath0 .    the status of the large-@xmath0 limit is certainly different for halpern - huang potentials which offer spontaneous symmetry breaking ( @xmath84 ) . these potentials exhibit the remarkable property that the nontrivial minimum persists for any finite value of @xmath6 but vanishes in the complete quantum theory for @xmath142 in the large-@xmath0 limit ; the o(@xmath0 ) symmetry is restored and the potential becomes flat near the origin .",
    "the coincidence between the position of the minimum and the critical value of the field strength may finally be ascribed to the formal resemblance between the large-@xmath0 flow equation and its linearized version determining the halpern - huang potentials .",
    "since the complete flow equation is much more complex , it appears rather improbable that this property continues to hold for finite @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , whether or not spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the quantum version of the halpern - huang potential at finite @xmath0 remains an open question .",
    "the present investigation at least observes a tendency of the system to restore o(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "this is in concordance with @xcite , where a one - loop calculation for the effective potential reveals a restoration of o(@xmath0 ) symmetry for potentials with ( @xmath195 ) .    in this context , a possible application of the halpern - huang potentials to the higgs sector of the standard model is still questionable . even if a quantum version of the potential with spontaneous symmetry breaking exists , the naturalness of the scalar sector alone is not sufficient to solve the hierarchy problem",
    "this is because the ( standard ) yukawa coupling to the fermions leads to large scalar mass renormalizations by fermion loops .",
    "therefore , some appropriate nonpolynomial interaction has to be chosen , also in this sector .",
    "nevertheless , the price to be paid would not be too high , because not only the hierarchy problem could be circumvented without additional degrees of freedom , but also the problem of `` triviality '' would be evaded .    from an intuitive point of view",
    ", the fact that the form of the potential is stable under the rg flow appears to be disappointing : since the potential remains inherently nonpolynomial , it is impossible to make contact with a would - be classical behavior that is determined by only a few ( polynomial ) terms .",
    "the latter is usually expected at large distances .",
    "for example , merely for very weak fields do the first terms in a taylor expansion of the kummer function represent a good approximation . for stronger fields , the application of the halpern - huang potentials",
    "might therefore be limited in this sense .    from a technical viewpoint ,",
    "our calculations hold for @xmath21 .",
    "we have given explicit results for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and generalizations to higher dimensions are straightforward .",
    "the limiting case @xmath196 has to be treated with great care for several reasons .",
    "first of all , finite @xmath0 results may only be trusted if the flow of the anomalous dimension @xmath38 is taken into account ; at least in the case of polynomial potentials , this turned out to be obligatory @xcite in order to obtain a good picture of the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "furthermore , the limit @xmath197 of the halpern - huang potentials offers several possibilities .",
    "it has already been observed variously in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , that the sine - gordon as well as the liouville potentials solve the linearized flow equation in @xmath196 .",
    "in fact , as can be easily shown with the aid of some identities of @xcite , both types of potentials arise as limiting cases of the halpern - huang potentials for @xmath77 in combination with the @xmath198 odd solution of the linearized flow equation : to be precise , the sine - gordon potential is recovered in the limit @xmath199 for @xmath200 , whereas the liouville potential is obtained by taking the limit @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "as far as the liouville theory is concerned , further similarities to the present results for the symmetry - preserving potentials are visible . in @xcite ,",
    "the liouville potential has also been found to behave stiffly under the rg flow for similar reasons as in the present case . in particular , quantum liouville theory appears to equal classical liouville theory , except for a flow of the central charge by one unit and a modified mass parameter .",
    "these similarities confirm the viewpoint that the halpern - huang potentials can be regarded as higher - dimensional analogues of liouville theory .",

    "useful discussions with r.  shaisultanov are also gratefully acknowledged .",
