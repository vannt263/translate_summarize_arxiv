    "the first two exact solution of einstein s field equations were obtained by schwarzschild [ 1 ] , soon after einstein introduced general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the first solution describes the geometry of the space - time exterior to a prefect fluid sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium . while the other , known as interior schwarzschild solution , corresponds to the interior geometry of a fluid sphere of constant ( homogeneous ) energy - density , @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of these two solutions in gr is well known .",
    "the exterior solution at a given point depends only upon the total mass of the gravitating body and the radial distance as measured from the centre of the spherical symmetry , and not upon the ` type ' of the density distribution considered inside the mass . however , we will focus on this point of crucial importance later on in the present paper . on the other hand ,",
    "the interior schwarzschild solution provides two very important features towards obtaining configurations in hydrostatic equilibrium , compatible with gr , namely - ( i ) it gives an absolute upper limit on compaction parameter , @xmath1 , mass to size ratio of the entire configuration in geometrized units ) @xmath2 for any static and spherical solution ( provided the density decreases monotonically outwards from the centre ) in hydrostatic equilibrium [ 2 ] , and ( ii ) for an assigned value of the compaction parameter , @xmath3 , the minimum central pressure , @xmath4 , corresponds to the homogeneous density solution ( see , e.g. , [ 3 ] ) .",
    "regarding these conditions , it should be noted that the condition ( i ) tells us that the values higher than the limiting ( maximum ) value of @xmath5 can not be attained by any static solution .",
    "but , what kinds of density variations are possible for a mass to be in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium ?",
    ", the answer to this important question could be provided by an appropriate analysis of the condition ( ii ) , and the necessary conditions put forward by exterior schwarzschild solution .    despite the non linear differential equations , various exact solutions for static and spherically symmetric metric are available in the literature [ 4 ] .",
    "tolman [ 5 ] obtained five different types of exact solutions for static cases , namely - type iii ( which corresponds to the constant density solution obtained earlier by schwarzschild [ 1 ] ) , type iv , type v , type vi , and type vii .",
    "the solution independently obtained by adler [ 6 ] , adams and cohen [ 7 ] , and kuchowicz [ 8 ] .",
    "buchdahl s solution [ 9 ] for vanishing surface density ( the `` gaseous '' model ) .",
    "the solution obtained by vaidya and tikekar [ 10 ] , which is also obtained independently by durgapal and bannerji [ 11 ] .",
    "the class of exact solutions discussed by durgapal [ 12 ] , and also durgapal and fuloria [ 13 ] solution .",
    "knutsen [ 14 ] examined various physical properties of the solutions mentioned in references ( [ 6 - 8 ] , [ 10 - 11 ] , and [ 13 ] ) in great detail , and found that these solutions correspond to nice physical properties and also remain stable against small radial pulsations upto certain values of @xmath3 .",
    "tolman s v and vi solutions are not considered physically viable , as they correspond to singular solutions [ infinite values of central density ( that is , the metric coefficient , @xmath6 at @xmath7 ) and pressure for all permissible values of @xmath3 ] .",
    "except tolman s v and vi solutions , all other solutions mentioned above are known as regular solutions [ finite positive density at the origin ( that is , the metric coefficient , @xmath9 at @xmath10 ) which decreases monotonically outwards ] , which can be further divided into two categories : ( i ) regular solutions corresponding to a vanishing density at the surface together with pressure ( like , tolman s vii solution ( mehra [ 15 ] , durgapal and rawat [ 16 ] , and negi and durgapal [ 17 , 18 ] ) , and buchdahl s `` gaseous '' solution [ 9 ] ) , and ( ii ) regular solutions correspond to a non - vanishing density at the surface ( like , tolman s iii and iv solutions [ 5 ] , and the solutions discussed in the ref.[6 - 8 ] , and [ 10 - 13 ] respectively ) .    the stability analysis of tolman s vii solution with vanishing surface density has been undertaken in detail by negi and durgapal [ 17 , 18 ] and they have shown that this solution also corresponds to stable ultra - compact objects ( ucos ) which are entities of physical interest .",
    "this solution also shows nice physical properties , such as , pressure and energy - density are positive and finite everywhere , their respective gradients are negative , the ratio of pressure to density and their respective gradients decrease outwards etc .",
    "the other solution which falls in this category and shows nice physical properties is the buchdahl s solution [ 9 ] , however , knutsen [ 19 ] has shown that this solution turned out to be unstable under small radial pulsations .    all these solutions ( with finite , as well as vanishing surface density ) discussed above , in fact ,",
    "fulfill the criterion ( i ) , that is , the equilibrium configurations pertaining to these solutions always correspond to a value of compaction parameter , @xmath3 , which is always less than the schwarzschild limit , i. e. , @xmath11 , but , this condition alone does not provide a necessary condition for hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "nobody has discussed until now , whether these solutions also fulfill the condition ( ii ) ? which is necessary to satisfy by any static and spherical configuration in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "recently , by using the condition ( ii ) , we have connected the compaction parameter , @xmath3 , of any static and spherical configuration with the corresponding ratio of central pressure to central energy - density @xmath12 and worked out an important criterion which concludes that for a given value of @xmath13 , the maximum value of compaction parameter , @xmath14 , should always correspond to the homogeneous density sphere [ 20 ] .",
    "an examination of this criterion on some well known exact solutions and equations of state ( eoss ) indicated that this criterion , in fact , is fulfilled only by those configurations which correspond to a vanishing density at the surface together with pressure [ 20 ] , or by the singular solutions with non - vanishing surface density [ section 5 of the present study ] .",
    "this result has motivated us to investigate , in detail , the various exact solutions available in the literature , and disclose the reason ( s ) behind non - fulfillment of the said criterion by various regular analytic solutions and eoss corresponding to a non - vanishing finite density at the surface of the configuration . in this connection , in the present paper , we have examined various exact solutions available in the literature in detail .",
    "it is seen that tolman s vii solution with vanishing surface density [ 15 , 17 , 18 ] , buchdahl s `` gaseous '' solution [ 9 ] , and tolman s v and vi singular solutions pertain to a value of @xmath3 which always turns out to be less than the value , @xmath15 , of the homogeneous density sphere for all assigned values of @xmath13 . on the other hand , the solutions having a finite non - zero surface density ( that is",
    ", the pressure vanishes at the finite surface density ) do not show consistency with the structure of the general relativity , as they correspond to a value of @xmath3 which turns out to be greater than @xmath15 for all assigned values of @xmath13 , and thus violate the criterion obtained in [ 20 ] .",
    "one may ask , for example , what could be , in fact , the reason(s ) behind non - fulfillment of the criterion obtained in [ 20 ] by various exact solutions ( corresponding to a finite , non - zero density at the surface ) ?",
    "we have been able to pin point ( which is discussed under section 3 of the present study ) the main reason , namely , the ` actual ' total mass @xmath16 which appears in the exterior schwarzschild solution , in fact , can not be attained by the configurations corresponding to a regular density variation with non - vanishing surface density .",
    "the metric inside a static and spherically symmetric mass distribution corresponds to @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of @xmath20 alone .",
    "the resulting field equations for the metric governed by eq.(1 ) yield in the following form @xmath21 + 1/r^2 , \\\\ - 8\\pi t^1_{1 } & = & 8\\pi p = e^{-\\lambda } [ ( \\nu'/r ) + ( 1/r^2 ) ] - 1/r^2 , \\\\ - 8\\pi t^2_{2 } & = & - 8\\pi t^3_{3 } = 8\\pi p = e^{-\\lambda } [ ( \\nu''/2 ) + ( \\nu'^2/4)-(\\nu'\\lambda'/4)+(\\nu'- \\lambda')/2r ] .",

    "eqs.(2 ) - ( 4 ) represent second - order , coupled differential equations which can be reduced to the first - order , coupled differential equations , by eliminating @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( 3 ) with the help of eqs . ( 2 ) and",

    "thus , in order to obtain a solution of these equations , one more equation is needed [ which may be assumed as a relation between @xmath24 , and @xmath0 ( eos ) , or can be regarded as an algebraic relation connecting one of the four variables with the radial coordinate @xmath20 ( or an algebraic relation between the parameters ) ] . for obtaining an exact solution , the later approach is employed .",
    "notice that eq.(9 ) yields the metric coefficient @xmath35 for the assumed energy - density , @xmath0 , as a function of radial distance @xmath31 .",
    "once the metric coefficient @xmath35 or mass @xmath30 is defined for assumed energy - density by using eqs.(9 ) or ( 8) , the pressure , @xmath24 , and the metric coefficient , @xmath36 , can be obtained by solving eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) respectively which yield two constants of integration .",
    "these constants should be obtained from the following boundary conditions , in order to have a proper solution of the field equations :",
    "( b1 ) in order to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium throughout the configuration , the pressure must vanish at the surface of the configuration , that is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radius of the configuration .",
    "( b2 ) the consequence of eq.(10 ) ensures the continuity of the metric parameter @xmath39 , belonging to the interior solution with the corresponding expression for well known exterior schwarzschild solution at the surface of the fluid configuration , that is : @xmath40 [ where @xmath41 is the total mass of the configuration ] .",
    "however , the exterior schwarzschild solution guarantees that : @xmath42 , which means that the matching of the metric parameter @xmath43 is also ensured at the surface of the configuration together with @xmath39 , that is    @xmath44    irrespective of the condition that the surface density , @xmath45 , is vanishing with pressure or not , that is @xmath46 together with eq .",
    "( 10 ) , or @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the ` compaction parameter ' of the configuration defined earlier , and @xmath16 is defined as [ eq .",
    "( 8) ]    @xmath49    thus , the analytic solution for the fluid sphere can be explored in terms of the only free parameter @xmath48 by normalizing the metric coefficient @xmath43 [ yielding from eq.(11 ) ] at the surface of the configuration [ that is , @xmath50 at @xmath51 after obtaining the integration constants by using eqs.(10 ) [ that is , @xmath52 at @xmath53 and",
    "( 11 ) [ @xmath54 at @xmath51 respectively .    however , at this place we recall the well known property of the exterior schwarzschild solution ( which follows directly from the definition of the mass , @xmath55 , appears in this solution ) , namely - at a given point outside the spherical distribution of mass , @xmath55 , it depends only upon @xmath55 , and not upon the ` type ' of the density variation considered inside the radius , @xmath56 , of this sphere .",
    "it follows , therefore , that the dependence of mass , @xmath55 , upon the ` type ' of the density distribution plays an important role in order to fulfill the requirement set up by exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "the relation , @xmath57 , immediately tells us that for an assigned value of the compaction parameter , @xmath3 , the mass , @xmath55 , depends only upon the radius , @xmath56 , of the configuration which may either depend upon the surface density , or upon the central density , or upon both of them , depending upon the ` type ' of the density variation considered inside the mass generating sphere .",
    "we argue that this dependence should occur in such a manner that the definition of mass , @xmath55 , is not violated .",
    "we infer this definition as the ` type independence ' property of the mass , @xmath55 , which may be defined in this manner : `` the mass , @xmath55 , which appears in the exterior schwarzschild solution , should either depend upon the surface density , or upon the central density , and in any case , not upon both of them so that from an exterior observer s point of view , the ` type ' of the density variation assigned for the mass should remain unidentified '' .",
    "we may explain the ` type independence ' property of mass , @xmath55 , mentioned above in the following manner : the mass , @xmath55 , is called the coordinate mass , that is , the mass as measured by some external observer , and from this observer s point of view , if we are ` measuring ' a sphere of mass , @xmath55 , we can not know , by any means , the way in which the matter is distributed from the centre to the surface of this sphere , that is , if we are measuring , @xmath55 , with the help of non - vanishing surface density [ obviously , by calculating the ( coordinate ) radius , @xmath56 , from the expression connecting the surface density and the compaction parameter , and by using the relation , @xmath58 , we can not measure it , by any means , from the knowledge of the central density ( because , if we can not know , by any means , the way in which the matter is distributed from the centre to the surface of the configuration , then how can we know about the central density ? ) , and this is possible only when there exist no relation connecting the mass , @xmath55 , and the central density , that is , the mass , @xmath55 , should be independent of the central density , meaning thereby that _ the surface density should be independent of the central density for configurations corresponding to a non - vanishing surface density_. however , if we are measuring the mass , @xmath55 , by using the expression for central density ( in the similar manner as in the previous case , by calculating the radius , @xmath56 , from the expression of central density , and using the relation , @xmath59 ) , we can not calculate it , by any means , from the knowledge of the surface density ( in view of the ` type independence ' property of the mass , @xmath55 ) , and this is possible only when there exist no relation connecting the mass , @xmath55 , and the surface density , meaning thereby that the central density should be independent of the surface density .    from the above explanation of ` type independence ' property of mass @xmath16 , it is evident that _ the ` actual ' total mass @xmath16 which appears in the exterior schwarzschild solution should either depend upon the surface density , or depend upon the central density of the configuration , and in any case , not upon both of them_. however , the dependence of mass @xmath16 upon both of the densities ( surface , as well as central ) is a common feature observed among all regular solutions having a non - vanishing density at the surface of the configuration [ see , for example , eqs.(21 ) , ( 25 ) , ( 29 ) , and ( 33 ) respectively , belonging to the solutions of this category which are discussed under sub - sections ( a ) - ( d ) of section 5 of the present study ] .",
    "thus , it is evident that the surface density of such solutions is _ dependent _ upon the central density and vice - versa , that is , the total mass , @xmath55 , depends upon _ both _ of the densities , meaning thereby that _ the ` type ' of the density distribution considered inside the sphere of mass , @xmath55 , is known to an external observer _ which is the violation of the definition of mass , @xmath55 ( defined as the ` type independence ' property of mass @xmath16 above ) , such structures , therefore , do not correspond to the ` actual ' total mass @xmath16 required by the exterior schwarzschild solution to ensure the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this also explains the reason behind non - fulfillment of the ` compatibility criterion ' by them which is discussed under section 5 of the present study .",
    "however , it is interesting to note here that there could exist only one solution in this regard for which the mass @xmath16 depends upon both , but the same , value of surface and centre density , and for regular density distribution the structure would be governed by the homogeneous ( constant ) density throughout the configuration ( that is , the homogeneous density solution ) .",
    "note that the requirement , ` type independence ' of the mass would be obviously fulfilled by the regular structures corresponding to a vanishing density at the surface together with pressure , because the mass @xmath16 will depend only upon the central density ( surface density is always zero for these structures ) [ see , for example , eqs.(37 ) and ( 41 ) , discussed under sub - section ( e ) and ( f ) for buchdahl s `` gaseous '' model and tolman s vii solution having a vanishing density at the surface , respectively ] .",
    "furthermore , the demand of ` type independence ' of mass , @xmath55 , is also satisfied by the singular solutions having a non - vanishing density at the surface , because such structures correspond to an infinite value of central density , and consequently , the mass @xmath16 will depend only upon the surface density [ see , for example , eqs.(46 ) and ( 50 ) , discussed under sub - section ( g ) and ( h ) for tolman s v and vi solutions , respectively ] .",
    "both types of these structures are also found to be consistent with the ` compatibility criterion ' as discussed under section 5 of the present study .",
    "the discussion regarding various types of density distributions considered above is true for any single analytic solution or equation of state comprises the whole configuration . at this place , we are not intended to claim that the construction of a regular structure with non - vanishing surface density is impossible .",
    "it is quite possible , provided we consider a two - density structure in such a manner that the mass @xmath16 of the configuration turns out to be independent of the central density so that the property ` type independence ' of the mass @xmath16 is satisfied .",
    "examples of such two - density models are also available in the literature ( see , e.g. , ref . [",
    "22 ] ) , but in the different context .",
    "however , it should be noted here that _ the fulfillment of ` type independence ' condition by the mass @xmath16 for any two - density model will represent only a necessary condition for hydrostatic equilibrium , unless the ` compatibility criterion ' [ 20 ] is satisfied by them , which also assure a sufficient and necessary condition for any structure in hydrostatic equilibrium _",
    "( this issue is addressed in the next section of the present study ) .",
    "the above discussion can be summarized in other words as : _ although the exterior schwarzschild solution itself does not depend upon the type of the density distribution or eos considered inside a fluid sphere in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium , however , it puts the important condition that only two types of the density variations are possible inside the configuration in order to fulfill the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium : ( 1 ) the surface density of the configuration should be independent of the central density , and ( 2 ) the central density of the configuration should be independent of the surface density_. obviously , the condition ( 1 ) will be satisfied by the configurations pertaining to an infinite value of the central density ( that is , the singular solutions ) , and/or by the two - density ( or multiple - density ) distributions corresponding to a surface density which turns out to be independent of the central density ( because , the regular configurations governed by a single exact solution or eos pertaining to this category are not possible ) . whereas , the condition ( 2 ) will be fulfilled by the configurations corresponding to a surface density which vanishes together with pressure [ the configurations in this category will include : the density variation governed by a single exact solution or eos , as well as the two - density ( or multiple - density ) distributions ] . however , the point to be emphasized here is that a two - density distribution in any of the two categories mentioned here will fulfill only a _ necessary _",
    "condition for hydrostatic equilibrium unless the ` compatibility criterion ' [ 20 ] is satisfied by them which also assure a necessary and sufficient condition for any structure in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium as mentioned above .",
    "the criterion obtained in [ 20 ] can be summarized in the following manner : for an assigned value of the ratio of central pressure to central energy - density @xmath60 $ ] , the compaction parameter of homogeneous density distribution , @xmath14 should always be larger than or equal to the compaction parameter @xmath61 of any static and spherical solution , compatible with the structure of general relativity .",
    "that is @xmath62 in the light of eq .",
    "( 15 ) , let us assign the same value , @xmath55 , for the total mass corresponding to various static configurations in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "if we denote the density of the homogeneous sphere by @xmath63 , we can write @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the radius of the homogeneous density sphere . if @xmath66 represents the radius of any other regular sphere for the same mass , @xmath55 , the average density , @xmath67 , of this configuration would correspond to @xmath68 eq . (",
    "15 ) indicates that @xmath69 . by the use of eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we find that @xmath70 that is , for an assign value of @xmath13 , the average energy - density of any static spherical configuration , @xmath67 , should always be less than or equal to the density , @xmath63 , of the homogeneous density sphere for the same mass , @xmath55 .    although , the regular configurations with finite non - vanishing surface densities , represented by a single density variation can not exist , because for such configurations the necessary condition set up by exterior schwarzschild solution can not be satisfied .",
    "however , we can construct regular configurations composed of core - envelope models corresponding to a finite central with vanishing and non - vanishing surface densities , such that the necessary conditions imposed by the schwarzschild s exterior solution at the surface of the configuration are appropriately satisfied .",
    "however , it should be noted that the necessary conditions satisfied by such core - envelope models at the surface may not always turn out to be sufficient for describing the state of hydrostatic equilibrium [ because for an assigned value of @xmath13 , the average density of such configurations may not always turn out to be less than or equal to the density of the homogeneous density sphere for the same mass , as indicated by eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) respectively ( it would depend upon the types of the density variations considered for the core and envelope regions and the the matching conditions at the core - envelope boundary ) ] .",
    "thus , it follows that the criterion obtained in [ 20 ] is able to provide a _ necessary _ and _ sufficient _ condition for any regular configuration to be consistent with the state of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the future study of such core - envelope models [ see , for example , the models described in [ 22 ] and [ 23 ] ] , based upon the criterion obtained in [ 20 ] could be interesting regarding two density structures of neutron stars and other stellar objects compatible with the structure of gr .",

    "the compaction parameters of the exact solutions described under sub - section ( e ) and ( f ) are denoted by @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively , and those discussed under sub - sections ( g ) and ( h ) are denoted by @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively .    solving these analytic solutions for various assigned values of the ratio of central pressure to central energy - density @xmath159",
    "$ ] , we obtain the corresponding values of the compaction parameters as shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively .",
    "it is seen that for each and every assigned value of @xmath13 , the values represented by @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively ( table 1 ) , turn out to be higher than @xmath15 ( that is , @xmath153 and @xmath160 ) , while those represented by @xmath161 , and @xmath158 respectively ( table 2 ) correspond to a value which always remains less than @xmath15 ( that is , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the configurations defined by @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively , do not show compatibility with the structure of general relativity , while those defined by @xmath161 , and @xmath158 respectively , show compatibility with the structure of general relativity .",
    "however , this type of characteristics [ that is , the value of compaction parameter larger than the value of @xmath15 for some or all assigned values of @xmath13 ] can be seen for any regular exact solution having a finite non - vanishing surface density [ because such exact solutions ( having finite central densities ) with non - vanishing surface densities can not possess the actual mass , @xmath55 , required to fulfill the boundary conditions at the surface ] . on the other hand , the value of compaction parameter for a regular solution with vanishing surface density , and a singular solution with non - vanishing surface density will always remain less than the value of @xmath15 for all assigned values of @xmath13 [ because such solutions naturally fulfill the definition of the actual mass , @xmath55 , required for the hydrostatic equilibrium ] .",
    "therefore , it is evident that the findings based upon the ` compatibility criterion ' carried out in this section are fully consistent with the definition of the mass , @xmath55 ( defined as the ` type independence ' property under section 3 of the present study ) .",
    "we have investigated the criterion obtained in the reference [ 20 ] which states : for an assigned value of the ratio of central pressure to central energy - density , @xmath165 , the compaction parameter , @xmath166 , of any static and spherically symmetric solution should always be less than or equal to the compaction parameter , @xmath15 , of the homogeneous density distribution .",
    "we conclude that this criterion is fully consistent with the reasoning discussed under section 3 which states that in order to fulfill the requirement set up by exterior schwarzschild solution ( that is , to ensure the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium ) , the total mass , @xmath55 , of the configuration should depend either upon the surface density ( that is , independent of the central density ) , or upon the central density ( that is , independent of the surface density ) , and in any case , not upon both of them .",
    "an examination , based upon this criterion , show that among various exact solutions of the field equations available in the literature , the regular solutions corresponding to a vanishing surface density together with pressure , namely - ( i ) tolman s vii solution with vanishing surface density , and ( ii ) buchdahl s `` gaseous '' solution , and the singular solutions with non - vanishing surface density , namely - tolman s v and vi solutions are compatible with the structure of general relativity .",
    "the only regular solution with finite non - vanishing surface density which could exist in this regard is described by constant ( homogeneous ) density distribution .",
    "this criterion provides a necessary and sufficient condition for any static spherical configuration to be compatible with the structure of general relativity , and may be used to construct core - envelope models of stellar objects like neutron stars with vanishing and non - vanishing surface densities , such that for an assigned value of central pressure to central density , the average density of the configuration should always remain less than or equal to the density of the homogeneous sphere for the same mass .",
    "this criterion could provide a convenient and reliable tool for testing equations of state ( eoss ) for dense nuclear matter and models of relativistic star clusters , and may find application to investigate new analytic solutions and eoss .",
