    "as dark energy primarily affects the expansion rate of the universe , one can gain information on the nature of dark energy by measuring the cosmological distances as well as the expansion rates of the universe accurately .",
    "while the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the type ia supernovae can be used for measuring the angular diameter distance out to @xmath6 and the luminosity distances out to @xmath7 , respectively , the power spectrum of matter distribution in the universe can be used to measure the angular diameter distances _ as well as _ the expansion rates of the universe out to a wider range of redshifts .    _",
    "two _ length scales are encoded in the matter power spectrum , @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    * the comoving hubble horizon size at the matter - radiation equality , @xmath9 $ ] . *",
    "the comoving sound horizon size at the so - called drag epoch at which baryons were released from photons , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 $ ] is the sound speed of photon - baryon fluid .",
    "the former determines the overall shape of the power spectrum of dark matter including the location of the peak of @xmath8 at @xmath12 , whereas the latter determines the location of the baryonic features called the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) .",
    "these length scales can be predicted from the 5-year data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , the wmap 5-year data yield @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . ] : @xmath17 and @xmath18 these lengths can be used as the `` standard rulers , '' which give us the angular diameter distances as well as the expansion rates of the universe @xcite .",
    "we , as observers who measure the angular and redshift distribution of galaxies , can measure _ four _ distance ratios given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the proper ( i.e. , not comoving ) angular diameter distance .",
    "we measure @xmath21 and @xmath22 by comparing the predicted lengths with the corresponding observed lengths perpendicular to the line of sight , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the lengths parallel to the line of sight . , and that perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "the angular observables , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are measured from @xmath25 , while the line - of - sight observables , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are measured from @xmath31 . ]",
    "the baos have been detected in the current galaxy redshift survey data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite .",
    "however , the current data are not yet sensitive enough to yield @xmath20 and @xmath32 separately @xcite ; thus , one can only determine a combined distance scale ratio from the spherically averaged power spectrum .",
    "since two spatial dimensions are available on the sky and one dimension is available along the line of sight , one can measure @xmath33^{1/3 }   = \\frac{r_s(z_{drag})}{[(1+z)^2d_a^2(z)c / h(z)]^{1/3}}.\\ ] ] @xcite have measured this quantity at @xmath34 from the sdss luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) , and @xcite have extended their analysis to include more data from the sdss lrg , as well as the sdss main galaxy samples and the 2dfgrs galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite have combined these measurements with the cmb distance ratios determined from the wmap 5-year data , the `` wmap distance priors , '' to obtain the constraints on dark energy properties .",
    "the analysis performed in @xcite is a proto - type of what one can do in the future .",
    "it is clear that we can gain more information if we can measure @xmath20 and @xmath32 simultaneously at various redshifts .",
    "therefore , in the future we should be able to perform a much more sensitive test of dark energy properties by combining @xmath20 and @xmath32 from the future galaxy survey data , and the cmb distance priors from the future cmb experiments such as planck .",
    "moreover , the baos capture only a part of information encoded in the shape of @xmath8 .",
    "one would miss another baryonic feature , the silk damping scale , by only measuring baos .",
    "a more serious drawback is that one would miss the other prominent standard ruler , @xmath36 , completely , by only measuring baos .",
    "nevertheless , there is one major advantage of using baos : the phases ( not the amplitude ) of baos are less sensitive to the distortion of the shape of @xmath8 due to non - linear matter clustering , non - linear galaxy bias , or non - linear redshift space distortion @xcite . as a result ,",
    "many studies have focused on developing various ways to extract the distance information from baos .",
    "most of the previous work focused only on extracting the baos from the spherically averaged @xmath8 ( which gives @xmath2 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite have studied the monopole and quadrupole moments in the galaxy power spectrum and their implications for determinations of the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath37 , and concluded that even in the worst case scenario ( i.e. , absence of the baos feature on the observed power spectrum ) , galaxy survey can still provide useful limits on @xmath37 from a combination of the monopole and quadrupole power spectra .",
    "recently , @xcite have explored an extraction of the quadrupole moment of the two - dimensional power spectrum , @xmath38 , which gives a different distance combination , @xmath39 .    in this paper",
    ", we shall develop a method for extracting @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously from the two - dimensional baos .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",

    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclusion ] . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use the cosmological parameters given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 @xcite , which are the maximum likelihood values inferred from the wmap 5-year data @xcite combined with the current bao data @xcite and type ia supernova data @xcite .",
    "we develop a method for extracting @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously from the two - dimensional baos without spherical averaging .",
    "our method builds upon the existing `` fit - and - extract '' ( fitex ) method developed by @xcite for extracting @xmath2 from a spherically averaged , one - dimensional @xmath8 .",
