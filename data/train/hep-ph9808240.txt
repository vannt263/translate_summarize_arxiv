    "in a very interesting paper @xcite feldman and cousins have recently proposed a `` unified approach to the classical statistical analysis of small signals '' that allows to construct classical confidence belts which `` unify the treatment of upper confidence limits for null results and two - sided confidence intervals for non - null results '' .",
    "this unified approach is very attractive because the transition from two - sided intervals to upper limits is automatic and the undercoverage introduced by a choice based on the data ( `` flip - flopping '' ) is avoided by construction .",
    "indeed , the unified approach has promptly been adopted by the particle data group as the new standard method for statistical inference  @xcite .    the probability to observe a number @xmath0 of events in a poisson process consisting in signal events with",
    "mean @xmath1 and background events with known calculated mean @xmath2 is @xmath3 the classical method for obtaining the confidence interval for the unknown parameter @xmath1 is based on neyman s method to construct a _",
    "confidence belt_. this confidence belt is the region in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane lying between the two curves @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that for each value of @xmath1 @xmath6|\\mu , b ) = \\alpha \\ , , \\label{cl}\\ ] ] where @xmath7|\\mu , b ) = \\sum_{n = n_1}^{n_2 } p(n|\\mu , b ) \\label{prob}\\ ] ] and @xmath8 is the desired confidence level .",
    "the two curves @xmath4 and @xmath5 are required to be monotonic functions of @xmath1 and can be inverted to yield the corresponding curves @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "then , if a number @xmath11 of events is measured , the confidence interval for @xmath1 is @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this method guarantees by construction the _ correct coverage _ , _",
    "i.e. _ the fact that the resulting confidence interval @xmath12 $ ] is a member of a set of confidence intervals obtained with an ensemble of identical experiments that contain the true value of @xmath1 with a probability @xmath8",
    ". actually , in the case of a poisson process , since @xmath0 is an integer , the relation ( [ cl ] ) can only be approximately satisfied and in practice the chosen _ acceptance intervals _",
    "@xmath13 $ ] are the smallest intervals such that @xmath6|\\mu , b ) \\geq \\alpha \\ , .",
    "\\label{clp}\\ ] ] this choice introduces an overcoverage for some values of @xmath1 and the resulting confidence intervals are _ conservative_. as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , conservativeness is an undesirable but unavoidable property of the confidence intervals in the case of a poisson process ( it is undesirable because it implies a loss of power in restricting the allowed range for the parameter @xmath1 ) .",
    "the construction of neyman s confidence belt _ is not unique _ , because in general there are many different couples of curves @xmath4 and @xmath5 that satisfy the relation ( [ cl ] ) .",
    "hence , an additional criterion is needed in order to define uniquely the acceptance intervals @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the two common choices are @xmath14 which leads to _ central confidence intervals _ and @xmath15 which leads to _ upper confidence limits_.    feldman and cousins @xcite proposed an ordering principle based on likelihood ratios that produces an automatic transition from a central confidence interval to an upper limit when the number of observed events in a poisson process with background is of the same order or less than the expected background . the acceptance interval for each value of @xmath1",
    "is calculated assigning at each value of @xmath0 a rank obtained from the relative size of the ratio @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( for a fixed @xmath2 ) is the non - negative value of @xmath1 that maximizes the probability @xmath18 : @xmath19 \\ , .",
    "\\label{best}\\ ] ] as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , `` @xmath20 is a ratio of two likelihoods : the likelihood of obtaining @xmath0 given the actual mean @xmath1 , and the likelihood of obtaining @xmath0 given the best - fit physically allowed mean '' .",
    "the rank of each value of @xmath0 is assigned in order of decreasing value of the ratio @xmath21 : the value of @xmath0 which has bigger @xmath21 has rank one , the value of @xmath0 among the remaining ones which has bigger @xmath21 has rank two and so on . the acceptance interval for each value of @xmath1",
    "is calculated by adding the values of @xmath0 in increasing order of rank until the condition ( [ clp ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is clear that the feldman and cousins ordering principle guarantees an automatic transition from two - sided confidence intervals to upper confidence limits for @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath23 , the rank of @xmath24 for @xmath25 is one , implying that the interval @xmath26 for @xmath25 is guaranteed to lie in the confidence belt .",
    "although the unified approach solves brilliantly the problem of obtaining a transition with correct coverage from two - sided confidence intervals to upper confidence limits for @xmath22 , it has the undesirable feature that even when @xmath22 the upper bound @xmath9 decreases when @xmath2 increases . from a physical point of view",
    "this is rather disturbing , because a stringent upper bound for @xmath1 obtained by an experiment which has observed a number of events significantly smaller than the expected background is not due to the fact that the experiment is very sensitive to small values of @xmath1 , but to the fact that less background events than expected have been observed .",
    "hence , two different experiments observing the _ same _ poisson process with mean @xmath1 and measuring the _ same _ number of events @xmath11 but expecting a different value for the background @xmath2 lead to two different upper limits for @xmath1 and the upper limit established by the experiment that expect a larger background can be significantly smaller than the other one .",
    "this is illustrated in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] i have plotted the 90% cl confidence belts obtained with the unified approach for @xmath27 .",
    "one can see that four experiments expecting , respectively , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 background events and observing , for example , @xmath32 lead to the 90% cl upper confidence limit @xmath33 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] i have plotted the upper end @xmath34 of the 90% cl confidence intervals obtained with the unified approach for @xmath35 as a function of the mean expected background @xmath2 .",
    "one can see that for each fixed value of @xmath0 the upper end of the confidence intervals tends to decrease rapidly as the mean expected background @xmath2 increases for small values of @xmath2 and stabilizes around a value close to 0.8 for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath34 is not monotonic , because of the discreteness of the observable @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] differs from fig.8 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the fact that i have not forced @xmath34 to be a non - increasing function of @xmath2 , because , as discussed above , the decrease of the upper confidence limit when @xmath2 increases is an undesirable feature from the physical point of view .",
    "therefore , there is no reason to force @xmath34 to be a non - increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "the only effect of this imposition is to introduce an overcoverage and then to increase the degree of conservativeness of the upper confidence limits , which is an undesirable effect .",
    "the decrease of the upper confidence limit for a given @xmath0 as the mean expected background @xmath2 increases is an unavoidable feature of the unified approach .",
    "however , i will show in the next section that this decrease can be weakened with the choice of _ a new ordering principle _ for the construction of the confidence intervals .",
    "the ordering principle introduced by feldman and cousins @xcite is useful in order to guarantee an automatic transition from two - sided confidence intervals to upper confidence limits .",
    "however , _",
    "it is not unique_. therefore , one can investigate the possibility to find a new ordering principle which minimizes the decrease of the upper confidence limit for a given @xmath0 as the mean expected background @xmath2 increases . with this aim one can notice that the value ( [ best ] ) of @xmath36 decreases proportionally to @xmath0 until it vanishes an then it is forced to be non - negative `` by hand '' .",
    "it is clear that it would be preferable to have a reference value for @xmath1 which is automatically always positive .",
    "such a positive reference value would imply that for small but not vanishing values of @xmath1 the values of @xmath0 smaller than @xmath2 have a high rank . as a consequence , the decrease of the upper confidence limit for a given @xmath0 as the mean expected background @xmath2 increases",
    "is weakened with respect to the one obtained with the feldman and cousins ordering principle .",
    "the new ordering principle that i propose here is based on the choice for the reference value for @xmath1 of the bayesian expectation value : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bayesian probability distribution for @xmath1 calculated assuming , which is the parameter probed directly in the experiment . ]",
    "a constant prior for @xmath39 ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath40 the result of the integral ( [ mu_ref1 ] ) calculated by parts is @xmath41 the obvious inequality @xmath42 implies that @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 represents a reference value for @xmath1 that not only is non - negative , as desired in order to have an automatic transition from two - sided intervals to upper limits , but is even bigger or equal than one .",
    "this is a desirable characteristics in order to obtain a weak decrease of the upper confidence limit for a given @xmath0 when the expected background @xmath2 increases .",
    "the implementation of the new ordering principle for the calculation of the confidence belt is identical to the implementation of the feldman and cousins ordering principle , except for the fact that in the calculation of the likelihood ratio @xmath21 , which determines the rank of each value of @xmath0 for a fixed value of @xmath1 , @xmath36 is replaced by @xmath44 : @xmath45 the resulting 90% cl confidence belts for @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    confronting fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one can see that the confidence belts are similar for @xmath46 , but the new upper confidence limits @xmath34 for @xmath22 are larger than the corresponding ones obtained with the feldman and cousins ordering principle .",
    "for example , four experiments expecting , respectively , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 background events and observing @xmath32 lead to the 90% cl upper confidence limits @xmath47 , respectively , which can be confronted with the respective values @xmath33 obtained with the feldman and cousins ordering principle .",
    "it is clear that the decrease of @xmath34 as @xmath2 is increased is milder with the new ordering principle .",
    "this is fully illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where i have plotted the upper end @xmath34 of the 90% cl confidence intervals obtained with the new ordering principle for @xmath35 as a function of the mean expected background @xmath2 .",
    "one can see that for small values of @xmath2 the decrease of the upper end @xmath34 of the confidence intervals as a function of @xmath2 is weaker than in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and for large values of @xmath2 the value of @xmath34 stabilizes around a value close to 1.7 , which is higher than in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    since the new ordering principle gives upper bounds that are higher than those obtained with the feldman and cousins ordering principle",
    ", it must give also higher lower bounds .",
    "this is confirmed by a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] and is illustrated in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the values of the lower confidence limit @xmath48 obtained with the two methods for @xmath49 are plotted as functions of the mean expected background @xmath2 .",
    "one can see that for each value of @xmath0 the maximum value of @xmath2 for which the lower confidence limit is different from zero is the same in the two methods .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact ( clearly seen with a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] ) that the minimum value of @xmath0 for which there is a lower bound different from zero is the same in the two methods ( as must be , since in both approaches the lower limit of the acceptance interval for @xmath25 is at @xmath50 ) .",
    "hence , the experimental possibility to claim a positive effect is the same in the two methods .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that the difference between the lower limits obtained with the two methods is moderate and tends to vanish for @xmath46 ( indeed , for @xmath46 we have @xmath51 and the two methods are practically equivalent ) .",
    "in this section i discuss the application of the new ordering principle proposed in section [ sec2 ] to the analysis of the recent null result of the karmen neutrino oscillation experiment  @xcite .",
    "the karmen experiment is searching for neutrino oscillations ( see , for example , @xcite ) in the @xmath52 channel with a sensitivity in the region of the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 which is allowed by the positive results of the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "so far the karmen experiment measured no events , with an expected background of @xmath55 events  @xcite . in this case",
    "the unified approach leads to an upper confidence limit of 1.1 events for the mean @xmath1 of neutrino oscillation events . on the other hand ,",
    "the sensitivity of the experiment , defined as `` the average upper limit one could get from an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no true signal '' , is of 4.4 events , four times bigger than the upper confidence limit ( notice that the average upper limit is calculated using the unified approach ) .",
    "this is clearly a pathological case in which the observation of less background events than expected leads to a stringent upper confidence limit @xmath34 , even if the experiment is not sensitive to the corresponding small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the exclusion curves ( the confidence region lies on the left of the exclusion curves ) in the @xmath53@xmath54 plane corresponding to the upper confidence limit of 1.1 events obtained with the unified approach and to the sensitivity of the experiment ( 4.4 events ) are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( the solid curves passing through the filled and empty circles , respectively ) .",
    "the solid curve passing through the filled squares corresponds to the upper limit of 2.3 signal events obtained with the bayesian approach .",
    "the shadowed area in fig .  [ fig6 ] is the region allowed at 90% cl by the results of the lsnd experiment @xcite and the dashed , dash - dotted and dash - dot - dotted curves are the 90% cl exclusion curves of the bugey @xcite , bnl e776 @xcite and ccfr @xcite experiments , respectively .",
    "the stringent limit for the neutrino mixing parameters represented by the unified approach exclusion curve strongly depends on the fact that none of the expected background events has been observed .",
    "indeed , the unified approach exclusion curve is based on the 90% cl exclusion of a mean signal of 1.1 events , but the signal that would have been excluded if karmen had observed , for example , two ( background ) events would have been 3.1 events and the corresponding exclusion curve in the @xmath53@xmath54 plane would lie on the right of the bayesian exclusion curve . in other words , the fact that the unified approach exclusion curve is very stringent is not due to the fact that no neutrino oscillations were observed , but to the fact that no background event has been observed .",
    "this is clearly undesirable from the physical point of view .",
    "the new ordering principle proposed in the previous section allows to obtain an exclusion curve with the correct coverage that minimizes the effect of the fact that no background event has been observed in the karmen experiment .",
    "the new ordering principle gives a 90% cl upper confidence limit of 1.9 events for the mean @xmath1 of neutrino oscillation events .",
    "this limit is close to the upper limit of 2.3 events obtained in the bayesian approach . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the exclusion curve corresponding to the upper confidence limit obtained with the new ordering principle ( the solid curve passing through the filled triangle ) lies close to the bayesian exclusion curve .",
    "the sensitivity of the karmen experiment calculated with the new ordering principle is of 4.7 events , rather close to the sensitivity of 4.4 events calculated with the unified approach .",
    "the corresponding curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( the solid curve passing through the empty triangles ) .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] one can see that the new ordering principle allows to obtain from the results of the karmen experiment an exclusion curve that is more reliable than the one obtained with the unified approach , because the discrepancy between the exclusion curve and the corresponding sensitivity curve is smaller .",
    "furthermore , since the new ordering principle implies an exclusion curve close to that obtained with the bayesian approach , we have a nice and desirable agreement of the results obtained with different statistical methods , one of which ( the new ordering principle ) guarantees a correct coverage .    in conclusion of this section",
    ", i would like to emphasize that , in spite of the improvement for the physical interpretation of the result of the karmen experiment obtained with the introduction of the new ordering principle , the fact that the karmen exclusion curves obtained with different statistical methods are significantly different shows that no firm physical conclusion can be inferred from the null result of the karmen experiment . since the karmen experiment is continuing to take data , some background events consistent with the expected rate should be observed in the near future and the different curves obtained with different statistical methods should converge . only in that case",
    "it will be possible to confirm or exclude the lsnd indication in favor of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the new ordering principle for the classical statistical analysis of poisson processes with background proposed here allows to improve the unified approach recently proposed by feldman and cousins  @xcite .",
    "the confidence intervals obtained with the new ordering principle take advantage of the desirable features of the unified approach and of the bayesian approach .",
    "the choice of the bayesian expectation value ( [ mu_ref1 ] ) as the reference value @xmath44 for the new ordering guarantees a reference value bigger or equal than one .",
    "the implementation of the new ordering principle in the same way as the feldman and cousins ordering principle is implemented in the unified approach guarantees that the resulting confidence intervals have the correct coverage and that there is an automatic transition from two - sided intervals to upper limits for @xmath56 .",
    "the fact that the reference value @xmath44 is @xmath57 implies that the decrease of the upper confidence limit @xmath34 for the mean signal @xmath1 as the mean expected background @xmath2 increases is weaker with the new ordering principle than with the feldman and cousins ordering principle .",
    "this is a desirable feature from a physical point of view , because it allows to minimize the influence that the observation of less background events than expected has on the upper confidence limit for the mean true signal events .",
    "if one does not like the fact that in the new ordering principle the reference value @xmath44 has been obtained using the bayesian method , one can consider eq.([mu_ref2 ] ) as the formula that allows to define @xmath44 in order to obtain the desired result ( as the conditions ( [ central ] ) and ( [ upper ] ) allow to obtain central confidence intervals and upper confidence limits , respectively ) .",
    "after all , the construction of the confidence belt , including the ordering principle , is not uniquely defined from first principles and a scientist can choose the method which maximizes the scientific meaning of the resulting confidence intervals , as long as the correct coverage is guaranteed .    in section  [ sec3",
    "] , i have applied the new ordering principle to the analysis of the null result of the karmen neutrino oscillation experiment  @xcite .",
    "the new ordering principle gives an exclusion curve in the plane of the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 which lies close to that obtained with the bayesian approach and is significantly less stringent than the one obtained with the unified approach .",
    "since the stringency of the unified approach exclusion curve is due to the fact that no background events have been observed ( with 2.88 mean expected background events ) and not to the sensitivity of the experiment to a small true neutrino oscillation signal , i think that the exclusion curve obtained with the new ordering represents more appropriately the physical implications of the null result of the karmen experiment .",
    "finally , i would like to notice that the new ordering principle has been formulated here for the case of a poisson process with background , but can be generalized to other controversial cases , as that of gaussian errors with a bounded physical region  @xcite .",
