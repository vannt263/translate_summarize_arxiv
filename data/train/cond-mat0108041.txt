    "recently developed systems of trapped ultra - cold gases open a wide new field for the study of many - particle physics.@xcite this includes the investigation of bose - einstein condensation of interacting bose particles@xcite , leading to macroscopic quantum states or `` matter waves '' . among the most interesting experiments",
    "there is the trapping of bosons in so - called optical lattices@xcite that are created by intersecting laser fields .",
    "typical lattice constant of optical lattices are @xmath3 nm .",
    "they exhibit unsual properties due to the interference of macroscopic quantum states .",
    "the interaction between the atoms is characterized by the ratio of the scattering length @xmath4 and the typical particle distance @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is density of particles . in most of the experiments we have @xmath8 such that these systems are dilute@xcite .",
    "interaction plays only a weak role in these systems such that the gross - pitaevskii approach is sufficient@xcite .",
    "after the experimental discovery of feshbach resonances in the trapped bose gases it became possible to tune the inter - atomic interaction with an applied magnetic field over a wide range of interactions@xcite .",
    "the scattering length for @xmath9rb atoms is @xmath10 nm but near feshbach resonances it is up to 500nm@xcite . in this case",
    "one can study an optical lattice in which the lattice constant ( determined by the wave length of the applied laser field ) is equal to the scattering length .",
    "then at most one boson can be found in the minima of the optical lattice .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "this field requires the study of models with strongly interacting particles .",
    "the so - called bose - hubbard model has been used@xcite to decribe an on - site interaction with coupling strength @xmath11 .",
    "a mean - field calculation@xcite has shown that the condensate vanishes in the strong - coupling limit @xmath12 , indicating that a strong interaction among the bosons has a destructive effect on the condensate .",
    "on the other hand , from the experiments it is believed that the interaction can still be considered as hard - core , characterized only by the scattering length @xmath4 but including many - particle collisions .    in the following",
    "we will tune the interaction by going from the weakly interacting ( dilute ) to the strongly interacting hard - core bose gas .",
    "this will be achieved by the assumption that each lattice site can accommodate @xmath0 bosons with the same energy@xcite .",
    "bosons can randomly change between these states and tunnel between neighboring lattice sites from / to any of these @xmath0 bosonic states with the same rate .",
    "interaction exists only between bosons at the same state .",
    "the regime @xmath13 describes a dilute bose gas whereas @xmath14 corresponds to a hard - core bose gas with only one state per lattice site .",
    "we will solve the limit @xmath1 within a saddle - point integration and apply a @xmath2-expansion to control systematically the corrections to the dilute bose gas towards a more strongly interacting bosons .",
    "in the first part of this section the bose gas on a lattice will be discussed without interaction using a complex field @xmath15 . this field will be replaced in the second part by a hard - core field which has the same propagator as the field @xmath15 . therefore ,",
    "in contrast to the bose - hubbard model , the interaction is carried by the field and not directly by the hamiltonian . a model of non - interacting bosons",
    "is considered on a @xmath16-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath17 sites .",
    "a boson can occupy statistically one of @xmath0 degenerate states at each site , and tunneling between these @xmath0 states at lattice site @xmath18 to any of the states at site @xmath19 occurs with the rate @xmath20 .",
