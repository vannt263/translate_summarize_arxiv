    ", we show that the effective hamiltonian on the central graph can be constructed by adding additional potentials on the branch - root nodes , which generates the same result as does the the original hamiltonian on the entire graph . as the demonstration , we present two exactly solvable models , which correspond to real and imaginary potentials .",

    "lwdin has developed a partitioning technique in the algebra of matrices , with which various self - consistent field methods can be nicely formulated . in this procedure , the original hamiltonian is simply transformed in a chosen discrete representation .",
    "the entire space is usually divided into two subspaces , named a model space and an orthogonal space .",
    "the basic idea is to find an effective hamiltonian which acts only within the target model space but generates the same result as the original hamiltonian acting on the complete space @xcite .",
    "the partitioning technique enables us focus our interest on certain part of the system . in general",
    ", the effective hamiltonian can not be obtained explicitly , but provides a formalism to develop perturbation method .    in the following",
