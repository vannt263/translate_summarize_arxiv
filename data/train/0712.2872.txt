    "in this paper we present results on the capacity of discrete - time rayleigh fading single - input single - output ( siso ) and multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels .",
    "we assume a noncoherent model where no channel state information is available at the transmitter or the receiver .",
    "the fadings are assumed to be stationary processes correlated in time but , for mimo channels , independent for distinct input / output antenna pairs .",
    "a hard peak - power constraint , in addition to an average - power constraint , is imposed on the input signals . for mimo channels",
    "we consider two types of constraints : under one the peak and average power constraints are imposed on each of the signals transmitted by the different antennas separately , and under the other the constraints are on the sum of the powers in the different signals .",
    "we focus on channel capacity at low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , but we also derive upper bounds that are valid for any snr",
    ".    we also consider siso channels with delay spread ( i.e. , frequency selective ) fading where the fading is modeled by a finite number of taps .",
    "the fading processes corresponding to the different taps are assumed to be independent across taps , and allowed , within each tap , to be correlated in time .",
    "the capacity of fading channels at low snr was studied in @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for our present work has been to understand the capacity of communication over wideband channels .",
    "work of kennedy @xcite , jacobs @xcite , telatar and tse @xcite , and durisi et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the capacity of such channels , in the wideband limit , is the same as for a wideband additive gaussian noise channel with no fading , but the input signals , such as @xmath0-ary fsk , are highly bursty in the frequency domain or time domain .",
    "the work of medard and gallager @xcite ( also see @xcite ) shows that if the burstiness of the input signals is limited in both time and frequency , then the capacity of such wideband channels becomes severely limited",
    ". in particular , the required energy per bit converges to infinity .",
    "wireless wideband channels typically include both time and frequency selective fading .",
    "one approach to modeling such channels is to partition the frequency band into narrow subbands , so that the fading is flat , but time - varying , within each subband .",
    "if the width of the subbands is approximately the coherent bandwidth of the channel , then they will experience approximately independent fading .",
    "the flat fading models used in this paper can be considered to be models for communication over a subband of a wideband wireless fading channel .",
    "the peak - power constraints that we impose on the signals can then be viewed as burstiness constraints in both the time and frequency domain for wideband communication , similar to those of @xcite . however , in this paper , we consider hard peak constraints , rather than fourth moment constraints as in @xcite , and we consider the use of multiple antennas .    the recent work of srinivasan and varanasi @xcite is closely related to this paper .",
    "it gives low snr asymptotics of the capacity of mimo channels with no side information for block fading channels , with peak and average - power constraints , with the peak constraints being imposed on individual antennas .",
    "one difference between @xcite and this paper is that we assume continuous fading rather than block fading .",
    "in addition , we provide upper bounds on capacity rather than only asymptotic bounds as in @xcite .",
    "we assume , however , that the fading processes are rayleigh distributed , whereas the asymptotic bounds do not require such distributional assumption .",
    "the work of rao and hassibi @xcite is also related to this paper .",
    "it gives low snr asymptotics of the capacity of mimo channels with no side information for block fading channels , but the peak constraints are imposed on coefficients in a particular signal representation , rather than as hard constraints on the transmitted signals .",
    "the model in this paper considers both a peak constraint and an average power constraint .",
    "upper bounds are given on the capacity which are valid for any ratio of these constraints , but the low snr asymptotics focuses only on the case where the ratio is constant .",
    "the ratio is also held constant in the asymptotic analysis of srinivasan and varinasi @xcite .",
    "the paper of wu and srikant @xcite focuses on the asymptotic capacity and error exponent for a fixed peak constraint , as the average power goes to zero .",
    "the paper of zheng et .",
    "al @xcite considers a general scaling of the peak constraint to average power constraint , with the scaling depending also on the coherence time . for a fixed ratio of peak constraint to average power constraint",
    ", the capacity scales quadratically as snr converges to zero , whereas for a fixed peak constraint , the capacity scales linearly with capacity as snr converges to zero .",
    "cases between these two extremes are investigated in @xcite .",
    "for wideband cellular systems using ofdm modulation , the peak constraint is usually expressed in the time domain , because of the limitations on the linear range of transmit power amplifiers .",
    "in such case , the peak power constraint in a particular frequency is not severe , so letting the peak constraint be constant or letting it converge to zero more slowly than the average power may be most appropriate . in cases in which interference with other users within the same band is especially important , for example for use of unlicensed or secondary spectrum , a peak constraint of the same order of magnitude as the average power constraint , as considered in this paper , may be the most relevant .",
    "the papers @xcite consider block fading channels , whereas a stationary , correlated fading channel model is adopted here .",
    "the capacity of noncoherent stationary flat fading channels at high snr was studied in @xcite , and the capacity of delay spread channels at high snr was recently studied in @xcite . for regular fading processes",
    "@xcite demonstrated a connection between the high - snr capacity growth and the error in predicting the fading process from _ noiseless _ observations of its past , whereas for nonregular fading @xcite demonstrated such a connection to the error in predicting the fading process from _ noisy _ observations of its past in the low observation noise regime .",
    "in this paper we point to an analogous connection between the low snr asymptotic capacity and the error in predicting the fading process from _ very noisy _ observations of its past .",
    "we show that these prediction errors in the high observation noise regime determine the asymptotic low snr capacity of siso channels and mimo channels with sum power constraints .",
    "they also determine the capacity of a class of mimo channels satisfying a certain separability condition .",
    "our results on delay spread channels follow from those on mimo channels with individual power constraints .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : mainresults ] we describe the channel models that are considered in this paper and present the main capacity results obtained with these channel models . in sections",
    "[ sec : siso ] to [ sec : delay ] the capacity results are proved  in some cases by exhibiting additional capacity bounds .",
    "we study four types of channels : siso channels , mimo channels with sum ( across transmit antennas ) power constraints , mimo channels with individual ( per transmit antenna ) power constraints , and siso channels with delay spread . in this section",
    "we shall describe these models and present our results on their capacities .",
    "we begin with the siso channel , which models noncoherent discrete - time single - antenna communication over time - selective flat fading channels .      the time-@xmath1 complex - valued output @xmath2 of the siso channel",
    "is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the time-@xmath1 channel input ; the snr @xmath5 is a positive scaling constant ; the complex stochastic process @xmath6 is the multiplicative fading process and the complex stochastic process @xmath7 models additive noise .",
    "we assume that the processes @xmath8 and @xmath7 are independent and that their joint law does not depend on the input sequence @xmath9 .",
    "the additive noise sequence @xmath10 is a sequence of iid proper complex normal ( pcn ) random variables of mean zero and variance one .",
    "such a distribution is denoted by @xmath11 . the fading process @xmath8 is assumed to be a zero - mean , unit - variance , stationary , pcn process .",
    "we denote its autocorrelation function by @xmath12 and assume that it has a spectral density function @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath14 and , in particular , @xmath15 note that the existence of its spectral density function implies that @xmath8 is ergodic .",
    "we shall assume throughout that the autocorrelation is square - summable , i.e. , that @xmath16 and define @xmath17    the input is simultaneously subjected to two power constraints : a peak power constraint and an average power constraint .",
    "the peak power constraint is that the time-@xmath1 channel input @xmath18 must satisfy , with probability one , @xmath19 the average - power constraint is that @xmath20 where the peak - to - average ratio @xmath21 is some constant satisfying @xmath22 and is the ratio of the maximum allowed peak power to the maximum allowed average power . since the average of a random variable can not exceed its maximal value , it follows that implies @xmath23 , so that setting @xmath24 renders the average power constraint inactive and thus reduces the problem to one of communication subject to a peak - power constraint only .",
    "the capacity of this channel is given by @xmath25 where the supremum is taken over all joint distributions on @xmath26 satisfying the peak power constraint and the average power constraint .",
    "the square - summability assumption , together with the assumption that @xmath8 is pcn , implies that the random process @xmath8 is weakly mixing ( in fact , mixing ) .",
    "therefore , a coding theorem exists for @xmath27 , based on notions surrounding information stability ( see @xcite ) and the shannon  mcmillan ",
    "breiman theorem for finite - alphabet ergodic sources .",
    "see @xcite for details",
    ". roughly speaking , the operational meaning of @xmath27 is that for any rate @xmath28 ( expressed in bits per channel use ) less than the capacity , there exists a sequence of codes with blocklength converging to infinity , such that each code meets peak and average power constraints ,",
    "each code has @xmath29 codewords , where @xmath30 is the length of the code , and the probability of decoding any codeword incorrectly converges to zero . the average power constraint can be imposed on the expectation ( over a uniformly chosen codeword ) or on the maximum ( over all the codewords ) of the normalized ( by the blocklength ) energy of the codeword .",
    "we define @xmath31 as the limiting ratio @xmath32 when the limit exists .",
