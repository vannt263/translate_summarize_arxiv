    "the multiferroic materials ( or multiferroics ) , where ferroelectricity coexists with some long - range magnetic order , have attracted a great deal of attention.@xcite a very special class of multiferroics is improper ferroelectrics . in the latter case , the ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization not only coexists , but can be induced by the magnetic order . the improper ferroelectrics are expected to display a strong magneto - electric coupling , which is extremely important for practical applications . for instance , because of such coupling , the fe polarization can be efficiently controlled by the magnetic field , while the magnetization can be controlled by the electric field . from a technological point of view , the ultimate goal is to find materials with the large fe polarization , which would be coupled to the magnetic texture at maximally possible temperature ( meaning that the magnetic transition temperature should be also high ) .",
    "manganites , crystalizing in the orthorhombic @xmath0 and @xmath1 structure , are regarded as one of the key multiferroic materials . despite low magnetic transition temperature ( typically , less than 40 k ) and modest values of the fe polarization ( less than @xmath11 @xmath12c/@xmath13 ) , which have been achieved so far,@xcite they have all essential ingredients to be called improper ferroelectrics .",
    "namely , the appearance of ferroelectricity coincides with some complex magnetic ordering .",
    "moreover , the possibility of switching the electric polarization by the magnetic fields has been directly demonstrated experimentally.@xcite therefore , these materials are fundamentally important and are typically used as a playground for testing various theories and models of multiferroicity .    nevertheless , the theoretical understanding of improper ferroelectricity in these compounds is still rather controversial and there is no unique view on the origin of this effect .",
    "first , all multiferroic manganites are rather artificially divided in two groups :    * the systems with the twofold periodic @xmath3-type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) texture ( such as homno@xmath14 and ymno@xmath14 ) , where the fe activity is attributed to the nonrelativistic exchange striction,@xcite and * the rest of the systems , with more general magnetic periodicity , where the fe activity is believed to be due to the relativistic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction and the magnetic texture itself is ascribed to the spin spiral.@xcite the typical example of such systems is tbmno@xmath14 , which has nearly fourfold periodic magnetic texture .",
    "this point was rationalized in the previous publications of one of the authors ( ref .  ) , where it was argued that there is no conceptual difference between twofold periodic and other multiferroic manganiets .",
    "the relativistic so interaction plays an equally important role in both cases : as it deforms the @xmath3-type afm state in the direction of the spin spiral , it will also deform the spin spiral and form a more general spatially inhomogeneous magnetic state .",
    "thus , the ground state of multiferroic manganites will be neither the collinear @xmath3-state nor the homogeneous spin spiral .",
    "the relativistic so interaction is essential for producing this inhomogeneity .",
    "however , the fe polarization itself is a nonrelativistic quantity in the sense that , for a given inhomogeneous distribution of spins , the appearance of the fe polarization can be described by nonrelativistic theories .",
    "another group of controversies is related to the question : how to calculate the polarization and what is the main contribution to it ?",
    "most of model calculations rely on the purely ionic picture , where the noncentrosymmetric distribution of spins gives rise to noncentrosymmetric atomic displacements .",
    "then , the polarization is evaluated in the framework of the point charge model.@xcite on the other hand , all modern first - principles calculations of the fe polarization are based on the berry - phase theory.@xcite besides ionic polarization , the berry - phase theory prescribes the existence of an electronic term .",
    "the latter can be expressed through the wannier functions and is reduced to the ionic polarization only if the wannier functions are fully localized at the atomic sites . in this sense , the deviation from the ionic picture is a measure of itineracy of the system .",
    "moreover , unlike the ionic contribution , the electronic polarization can be finite even in the centrosymmetric crystal structure , provided that the inversion symmetry is broken by a magnetic order .",
    "thus , the berry - phase theory excellently suits for improper ferroelectrics .",
    "the first - principles calculations show that the electronic polarization can be as large as or even exceed the ionic contribution.@xcite nevertheless , the physical meaning of this effect is still rather obscure and the electronic polarization is largely ignored in model calculations of multiferroic manganites .",
    "the purpose of this work is to make a bridge between first - principle electronic structure calculations and models of the fe polarization .",
    "our main message is that the electronic polarization is important and can not be ignored . in the model calculations ,",
    "it can be described by some `` superexchange type '' theories , similar to interatomic magnetic interactions.@xcite on the other hand , in the first - principles calculations , one should pay a special attention to the relative direction of the electronic and ionic polarization : because of additional approximations , results of theoretical structural optimization do not necessarily guarantee the correct answer to this question .",
    "our analysis will be based on results of two previous works ( refs .  ) , where    * a realistic low - energy model for the mn @xmath6 bands of manganites was constructed on the basis of first - principles electronic structure calculations in the local - density approximation ( lda ) ; * this model was applied for the search of the magnetic ground state of orthorhombic manganites ; * the model calculations were supplemented with the berry - phase theory for the analysis of the fe polarization and its dependence on the form of the magnetic ground state .    in this work",
    "we will further rationalize the story .",
    "first , we will show that the behavior of the fe polarization can be well described in the framework of the double exchange ( de ) theory.@xcite the definition of the de hamiltonian will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : idea ] .",
    "particularly , we will show that with the proper definition of the de model , which should include effects of orbital polarization of coulombic origin , one can reproduce , even quantitatively , the values of fe polarization obtained in a more general mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations for the low - energy model .",
    "then , we will introduce an analytically solvable model for the @xmath2 electrons in the single zigzag chain ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : analytics ] ) and argue that , besides double exchange , the behavior of electronic polarization in realistic manganites always corresponds to the limit of large intra - atomic energy splitting @xmath5 between @xmath2 states ( sec .  [ subsec : parameters ] ) .",
    "it will allow us to further generalize our story and derive an analytical expression for the electronic polarization in an arbitrary twofold periodic magnetic texture , based on the perturbation theory expansion for the wannier functions in the first order of @xmath7 ( sec .",
    "[ subsec:5orbitals ] ) .",
    "the idea itself has some similarities with the superexchange theory of interatomic magnetic interactions.@xcite this analytical expression nicely explains the behavior of electronic polarization in the low - energy model as well as in the more general first - principles calculations .",
    "it also provides a good quantitative estimate for the polarization . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : problems ] , we will present a critical analysis of relative directions of electronic and ionic polarizations in the experimental and theoretically optimized @xmath1 structures of ymno@xmath14 . then , in sec .",
    "[ subsec : switching ] , we will explain how the electronic polarization can be manipulated by changing the magnetic texture . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the starting point of our work is that the main electronic and magnetic properties of multiferroic manganites can be described reasonably well by the one - electron hamiltonian : @xmath15 which is constructed in the basis of wannier orbitals for the mn @xmath6 bands . in this notations ,",
    "the matrix @xmath16 has site - diagonal ( @xmath17 ) and off - diagonal ( @xmath18 ) elements : the former describes the crystal - field effects , while the latter stands for transfer integrals .",
    "we do not consider explicitly the relativistic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction .",
    "more specifically , it is assumed that the so interaction is important for specifying the directions of spins in some noncollinear magnetic texture .",
    "however , it is unimportant for calculations of the fe polarization itself , provided that the directions of spins are known and the corresponding magnetic texture can be described by appropriate rotations of the mean - field potentials @xmath19 , which will be specified below .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath16 does not depend on the spin - indices , @xmath20@xmath21 @xmath22 or @xmath23 , and can be presented in the form @xmath24 . in the more general five - orbital model , that we consider ,",
    "the indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 have the following order : @xmath27@xmath21 @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34@xmath31@xmath35 . in the two - orbital model ,",
    "constructed only for the @xmath2 bands , the indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 run over @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath34@xmath31@xmath35 .",
    "@xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mf ] ) is the self - consistent one - electron potential , which is constructed using parameters of effective coulomb interactions and the density matrix for the mn @xmath6 states .",

    ", the electronic low - energy model can be derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , starting from the local - density approximation ( lda).@xcite the construction of the model can be formulated rather rigorously in the basis of wannier orbitals for the mn @xmath6 bands .",
    "then , @xmath16 is identified with the matrix elements of the lda hamiltonian in the wannier basis .",
    "thus , without @xmath19 , the parameters @xmath16 describe the lda electronic structure for the mn @xmath6 bands .",
    "the parameters of effective coulomb interactions for the mn @xmath6 bands can be derived , also in the wannier basis , using constrained random - phase approximation and/or the constrained lda approach . for details ,",
    "the reader is referred to the review article ( ref .  ) .",
    "then , the model can be solved in the mean - field hf approximation , which gives us the potentials @xmath19.@xcite    after the solution , the fe polarization can be obtained by applying the berry - phase theory.@xcite namely , the fe polarization is divided into the ionic ( @xmath36 ) and electronic ( @xmath37 ) parts : @xmath38 the ionic term reflects the non - cenrosymmetricity of the crystal structure itself and is associated with the displacements ( @xmath39 ) of ionic charges ( @xmath40 ) away from the centrosymmetric positions : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the primitive cell volume .",
    "the electronic term reflects the fact of the inversion symmetry breaking in the form of the wavefunctions , obtained from the solution of quantum - mechanical schrdinger equations .",
    "it incorporates the effects of the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking and can take place even for centrosymmetric crystalline systems , provided that the inversion symmetry is broken by magnetic or some other electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the electronic term can be computed in the reciprocal space , by using the formula of king - smith and vanderbilt:@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the cell periodic wavefunction , the summation runs over the occupied bands ( @xmath45 ) , the @xmath46-space integration goes over the first brillouin zone , and @xmath31@xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the electron charge . in practical calculations , eq .",

    "then , since the oxygen @xmath53 band is fully occupied , it is reasonable to take @xmath54@xmath55 , which corresponds to the formal valence state of o@xmath56 . on the other hand , all valence states of the rare - earth ( re )",
    "ions are empty .",
    "this should correspond to @xmath57 . in the noncentrosymmetric @xmath1 structure",
    ", the mn sites do not contribute to @xmath52.@xcite therefore , the parameter @xmath58 is not important for our purposes .    in the previous publications ,",
    "this procedure was applied to the series of orthorhombic manganites .",
    "particularly , the behavior of parameters of the low - energy model , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , was discussed in ref .  .",
    "an example of such parameters for ymno@xmath14 can be found in supplemental material of ref .  .",
    "the properties of the magnetic ground state , obtained from the solution of the low - energy model in the hf approximation , and corresponding behavior of the fe polarization were considered in refs .  .",
    "note that a scaling factor was missing in the calculations of the fe polarization reported in ref .  .",
    "this error was corrected in ref .  .",
    "as far as the fe polarization is concerned , the low - energy model reproduces results of the first - principles electronic structure calculations ( refs .  ) on a good semi - quantitative level .",
    "moreover , the low - energy model was very helpful in clarifying details of the noncollinear magnetic ground state , which can be realized in orthorhombic manganites , namely : ( i ) the canting of spins and magnetic origin of the twofold periodic phase;@xcite ( ii ) deformation of the spin - spiral texture , yielding fe activity in both two- and fourfold periodic systems;@xcite ( iii ) the absence of the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking in systems with odd magnetic periodicity.@xcite    in this work , we will further rationalize the story by considering the de limit for the fe polarization .",
    "let us start with the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , where each @xmath19 is diagonal with respect to the spin indices , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the @xmath61@xmath62@xmath61 matrices in the orbital subspace .",
    "the states with @xmath63 are occupied by four electrons and the ones with @xmath64 are empty .",
    "then , @xmath65 can be identically presented in the form : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the intra - atomic exchange splitting between centers of gravity of the majority ( @xmath22 ) and minority ( @xmath23 ) spin states , and @xmath68 describes the orbital splitting of unoccupied @xmath23-spin states .",
    "moreover , four @xmath6 electrons obey hund s first rule , which tend to form the state with the maximal spin @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , besides on - site coulomb repulsion ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath67 will contain a large contribution , being proportional to the local magnetic moment ( @xmath71 ) and the intra - atomic exchange coupling ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is the main reason why for many applications @xmath67 can be treated as the largest physical parameter , and the de limit corresponds to the extreme situation where @xmath73.@xcite on the other hand , the splitting of unoccupied @xmath23-spin states is considerably weaker .",
    "for example , in the hf approximation , it is caused by relatively small nonsphericity of the coulomb potential .",
    "therefore , when @xmath73 , the details of ( finite ) splitting of the @xmath23-spin states become unimportant and our first approximation is to replace @xmath68 by @xmath74 .",
    "it allows us to present @xmath19 in the following form : @xmath75 where the orbital - dependent part ( @xmath76 ) does not depend on the spin indices and the spin - dependent part does not depend on the orbital ones .",
    "therefore , spin and orbital transformations of eq .",

    "the difference is not extremely large .",
    "however , as we will see in a moment , it is sufficient to justify the use of the de limit for the fe polarization .",
    "as the next step , let us consider an arbitrary magnetic texture , where the directions of spin ( @xmath79 ) at each site of the lattice are specified by the combinations of polar ( @xmath80 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath81 ) angles : @xmath82 .",
    "corresponding electronic structure can be generated by the unitary transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : vapprox ] ) , using spin - rotation matrices : @xmath83 where @xmath84 here , it is assumed that the angles @xmath85 are specified by magnetic interactions in the system ( for the form of the optimized magnetic textures , the reader is referred to refs .  ) and the one - electron potential for an arbitrary direction of spin can be obtained by using rigid spin rotations [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rpot ] ) ] without additional self - consistency .",
    "this is a very good approximation in the case of manganites , because :    * due to the strong hund s coupling , the local spin magnetization will always tend to stay in the saturated state .",
    "therefore , the absolute value of this magnetization will only weakly depend on the direction of spins at other magnetic sites . *",
    "the orbital configuration is rigidly fixed by the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion and practically does not depend on the type of the spin texture .",
    "for example , the energy splitting of the @xmath2 states , caused by the jt distortion , is about @xmath86 ev , while typical strength of interatomic exchange interactions is of the order of several mev.@xcite the exchange interactions can be additionally optimized by means of the orbital reconstruction , which works against the jt splitting.@xcite however , the possible energy gain , caused by this reconstruction ( typically , of the order of the exchange interactions themselves ) is much smaller than the energy of the jt distortion .",
    "thus , the orbital reconstruction does not occur .",
    "the next step is to transform eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rpot ] ) to the local coordinate frame , corresponding to the @xmath87 direction of magnetization at each site of the lattice .",
    "it leads to the following transformation of the transfer integrals : @xmath88 then , taking the limit @xmath73 , we obtain the well known de model : @xmath89 which formulated in the subspace of the @xmath22-spin states , in the local coordinate frame.@xcite the prefactor @xmath90 is nothing but the @xmath91-element of the product @xmath92 : @xmath93 which satisfies the well known property : @xmath90@xmath21 @xmath11 and @xmath94 for the ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically coupled spins , respectively .",
    "therefore , in the de limit , any antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase effectively breaks up into fm segments .",

    "for example , such a behavior is typical for the eu@xmath350y@xmath351mno@xmath14 compounds , containing only nonmagnetic rare - earth elements , that excludes the influence of the @xmath352 magnetism on the fe polarization.@xcite the results of this section suggest that this behavior is more generic and can be anticipated in other regimes , including the twofold periodic magnetic systems .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is related to the specific symmetry of the crystal structure ( in the case of orthorhombic manganites  the @xmath0 symmetry ) and how it is lowered by the magnetic ordering in the de limit .",
    "it should not be confused with the spin - spiral alignment , which does break the inversion symmetry of the de hamiltonian ( see sec .  [ subsec:5orbitals ] ) .",

    "[ fig.iecanting](a ) .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize that the noncollinear magnetic texture with @xmath343 can be stabilized even after including the so interaction .",
    "the situation was discussed in ref .  .",
    "this work is a continuation of previous studies , devoted to multiferroic manganites , which crystallize in the orthorhombic @xmath0 and @xmath1 structure.@xcite our main motivation was to present a transparent physical picture , which would explain why and how the ferroelectric polarization is induced by some complex magnetic order . for these purposes",
    "we invoke the double exchange theory , which was formulated for the low - energy model , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "as far as the polarization is concerned , the de theory is very robust and reproduces results of more general mean - field hartree - fock calculations at a good quantitative level .",
    "furthermore , the main advantage of the de theory is that it allows us to greatly simplify the problem and , in a number of cases , derive an analytical expression for the fe polarization .",
    "thus , we could clarify very basic aspects of the fe activity in manganites with twofold periodic magnetic texture .    in our analysis",
    "we started from the general berry - phase theory.@xcite in the case of improper ferroelectrics , the basic quantity to be considered is the electronic polarization , which incorporates the change of the electronic structure in response to the noncentrosymmetric alignment of spins .",
    "then , our main message is that , for the analysis of electronic polarization in realistic manganites , one can always use two physical limits .",

    "the second one is the limit of large intra - atomic splitting @xmath5 between the majority - spin @xmath2 states .",
    "therefore , for the electronic polarization , one can always consider the perturbation theory expansion with respect to both @xmath353 and @xmath7 .",
    "this perturbation theory describes asymmetric transfer of some weight of the wannier functions to the neighboring sites , which gives rise to the polarization .",
    "there is some similarity with the theory of superexchange interactions , which deals with the virtual hoppings,@xcite and where the terms proportional to @xmath7 and @xmath353 account for the fm and afm contributions , respectively.@xcite therefore , the de limit @xmath67@xmath177@xmath178 would correspond to neglecting all afm contributions .",
    "it may not be a good approximation for interatomic magnetic interactions .",

    "this again justifies the use of the de limit in the latter case .",
    "on the basis of this perturbation theory expansion , we were able to explain how the electronic polarization depends on the relative directions of spins in an arbitrary twofold periodic magnetic texture .",
    "particularly , the multiferroic effect in orthorhombic manganites is a nonlocal phenomenon in the sense that the inversion symmetry is broken by making some of the mn - mn bonds magnetically inequivalent . in the de model , this inequivalence",
    "is achieved by the additional modulation of transfer integrals by @xmath90 .",
    "then , one trivial conclusion is that there will be no magnetic inversion symmetry breaking in the spin - spiral phase , where all @xmath90 are the same .",
    "therefore , in order to make finite polarization , it is essential to deform the spin spiral . in orthorhombic manganites ,",
    "such deformation is caused by the relativistic spin - orbit interaction.@xcite the second important precondition for the fe activity is the asymmetry of the transfer integrals , which should simultaneously have symmetric and antisymmetric components .",
    "we also pointed out on a serious problem in the structural optimization , which apparently exists in the first - principles calculations ( at least at the level of lda@xmath95@xmath70 and gga@xmath95@xmath70 approximations for the exchange - correlation functional without relativistic spin - orbit coupling ) and which typically results in the large overestimation of the value of fe polarization in comparison with experimental data.@xcite in this work , we were able to clarify the origin of this problem : in the theoretical structure , the directions of noncentrosymmetric atomic displacements are inconsistent with the type of the orbital ordering in the ferromagnetic zigzag chains , which controls the sign of the electronic polarization .",
    "as the result , the electronic and ionic contributions have the same sign in the theoretically optimized structure , while , according to the experimental crystal structure , they should have opposite signs and partially cancel each other .    finally , we explained how the electronic polarization can be switched between orthorhombic @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions by inverting the magnetic texture in every second @xmath10 plane .",
    "we also expect a gigantic change of the absolute value of the polarization itself , which is related to very different symmetry properties of the nearest - neighbor transfer integrals along the @xmath9 direction and in the @xmath10 plane of manganites .    in this work ,",
    "our analysis was limited by twofold periodic magnetic textures , which illustrate the basic idea of the double exchange theory of ferroelectric polarization .",
    "the idea can be extended to the systems with more general magnetic periodicity : apart from the additional complexity of the magnetic texture , there is no fundamental difference between twofold and more general magnetic periodicity . in both cases , the basic property , which should be considered and which gives rise to",

    "<S> this expression explains the functional dependence of @xmath4 on the relative directions of spins . </S>",
