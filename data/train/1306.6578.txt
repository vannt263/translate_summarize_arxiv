    "initial conditions , which are to be set for ion density , velocity , and temperature , are chosen as uniform fields , with values based on the expected device off state .",
    "the fluid inlet is represented by the boundary region @xmath37 , where dirichlet conditions are enforced for the velocity nd the temperature @xmath38 , and homogeneous neumann condition is enforced on @xmath39 . since the inlet is supposed to be far from the electrodes , and thus from the region where major electrical phenomena are localized , the electrical variables are also considered to have vanishing gradients along the outward normal direction @xmath40 on the boundary @xmath36 . at the fluid outlet @xmath41 , we require the normal component of the fluid stress tensor and of the temperature , charge density , and electric potential gradients to vanish , representing again a region which is far from the major phenomena in the system .",
    "the boundary region denoted as @xmath42 represents an electrically insulating wall and both drift and diffusion current densities ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ) are supposed to independently vanish . since @xmath42 is also a solid wall , the condition of non - penetration @xmath45 , which we impose on the fluid flow , allows for the drift current to vanish if @xmath46 .",
    "diffusion currents are instead damped by the homogeneous neumann condition for ion density @xmath47 . additionally , fluid flow is subject to a non - slip condition @xmath48 .",
    "temperature can either assume an imposed value , or satisfy an imposed thermal energy flux trough the wall surface , depending on the situation at hand .    finally , the regions @xmath49 and @xmath2 represent the cathode and anode contacts , respectively . at both electrodes , we enforce dirichlet condition for the electrostatic potential and no - slip , no - penetration conditions for the fluid flow .",

    ", homogeneous neumann condition is enforced on @xmath49 .",
    "physically , this means that the only current allowed through the cathode is due to ion drift : since mass is not allowed to cross the boundary , though , this results in imposing each one of the positive ions hitting the cathode to recombine with an extracted electron .",
    "boundary conditions for ion density on the anode are instead more complicated , and section  [ sec : bcs ] is entirely devoted to the derivation and comparison of different models for such boundary conditions .",
    "to trigger the corona discharge , the voltage drop between anode and cathode must exceed a threshold ( or _ onset _ ) value which we denote by @xmath50 , while the corresponding magnitude of the electric field at the anode is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "the generally accepted kaptsov s hypothesis@xcite states that free charge , emitted by the corona for voltages higher than @xmath50 , causes a shielding of the anode that results in clamping of the anode electric field at the onset value @xmath51 . while @xmath50 depends very strongly on the whole device geometry , experimental evidence indicates that @xmath52 is strictly correlated with the curvature radius of the anode contact.@xcite    at the microscale , corona discharge is generated by the impact ionization of gas molecules and avalanche multiplication of electrons .",
    "according to the avalanche model first developed by townsend @xcite , cations are generated in an area characterized as the locus of points @xmath53 such that : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are parameters depending on the applied electric field , the pressure , and the chemical composition of the gas and the electrodes , whereas @xmath57 is the trajectory of a negatively charged particle , which leaves from the cathode and drifts to @xmath58 due to the force exerted on it by the electric field .",
    "although not of much practical interest when space charge is not negligible , relation   provides a rough estimate for the thickness of the ionization region , where the gas can effectively be considered to be in plasma state .",
    "such thickness depends on the geometry of the anode as well as on the gas pressure and on the electric field ; in corona discharge regime , it is so small in comparison to the of the neutral fluid region , that it makes sense to adopt a _ lumped _ model for the ionization region and to represent it as a portion of the anode surface . under such approximation ,",
    "the only charge carriers within the bulk fluid region are cations.@xcite    in this section we discuss several possible options for modeling the rate at which such cations are injected into the bulk fluid region . in order to ease the comparison of the different models , we will express all of them in the common form of a robin - type boundary condition for equation  : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the component of the ion density gradient normal to @xmath61",

    "this latter assumption , together with the fact that knowledge of a measured value of the current corresponding to each value of the applied bias is required , strongly limits the ability of simulations based on   to provide useful information about the impact of the anode contact geometry on device performance .",

    "the maximum density is located directly in front of the pipe , and a main conductive region is formed .",
    "figure  [ fig : thermo : field ] shows some electric field lines , which are also parallel to the ehd volume force , that triggers the fluid motion .",
    "in this work , we studied the numerical approximation of the effects of electric discharge on ambient air flow . first , we proposed an algorithm to deal with the multiphysics mathematical model describing the system , by the coupling of the different and particular approaches already used in the fields of electronic device simulation and computational fluid dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we analyzed the particular phenomenon of corona discharge and proposed a phenomenological approach , which allows for the removal of the plasma subdomain and the electron density conservation equation from the computation .",
    "four different models following this approach have been considered , discussed , and compared .",
    "the conclusion is that both the _ ideal _ and _ exponential diode _",
    "models , proposed in this work , are able to reproduce the correct behavior of the corona discharge ehd system _ without _ need of measured data for the electric current in the actual device at hand .",
    "finally , we showed how our models and algorithm can be effectively used in a relevant industrial application .",
