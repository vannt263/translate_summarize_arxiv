    "we address this question for two natural and widely studied models and obtain essentially optimal bounds on the equilibration time .",

    "monotone surfaces can be visualized as a stack of unit cubes centered around the vertices of @xmath0 , which is decreasing in both the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 direction ( see figure [ mon - surf ] ) ; see section [ sec:3d ] for the precise definition .    .",
    "the picture is taken from @xcite . ]",
    "this is equivalent to the zero - temperature dynamics of the three - dimensional ising model with boundary conditions that enforce the presence of an interface ; alternatively , it can be seen as a stochastic dynamics for lozenge tilings of a finite region of the plane , or of dimer coverings of a finite region of the honeycomb lattice .",

    "the conjectured behavior of the mixing time @xmath8 is of order @xmath9 if @xmath2 is the linear size of the region under consideration .",
    "the monotonicity condition produces dynamical constraints which prevent the application of standard tools to obtain non - trivial bounds on @xmath8 . to overcome this difficulty , a modified `` non - local '' version of the dynamics , whose moves involve adding or removing piles of unit cubes stacked one on top of the other , was introduced in @xcite . using this device , a polynomial ( in @xmath2 ) upper bound on @xmath8",
    "was proven in @xcite .",
    "an important breakthrough was obtained by d. wilson in @xcite , where the mixing time of the non - local dynamics was sharply analysed and shown to be of order @xmath9 ( from below and above ) . via classical comparison arguments , this implies @xcite that @xmath10 for the single - site dynamics - here and below we use the notation @xmath11 for any quantity that is bounded above by @xmath12 up to polylog(@xmath2 ) factors .",

    "the invariant measure is the gibbs distribution corresponding to a potential given by the absolute value of the height gradients . due to the non - strictly convex character of the interaction , even obtaining",

    "the main contribution of the present paper is a proof that , for both problems , @xmath28 ; see theorem [ th:3d ] for monotone surfaces and theorem [ th : sos ] for sos . in the monotone surface case , we must restrict our analysis to the case where the boundary condition is _ approximately planar _ ( see e.g. figure [ mon - surf ] ) , so that on a macroscopic scale , at equilibrium , the surface is flat , cf .",
    "theorem [ th : eq3d ] . at the microscopic scale",
    "this corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the 3d ising model with so - called dobrushin boundary conditions , i.e.  the boundary spins take the value @xmath24 according to whether they lie above or below a given plane . in any finite volume",
    ", this leads to the uniform distribution over all monotone surfaces compatible with the given `` planar '' boundary conditions . in the infinite volume limit @xmath29 , such uniform distribution is related to a _ translation invariant , ergodic gibbs measure _ on dimer coverings of the infinite honeycomb lattice @xcite , described by a determinantal point processes",
    "whose kernel is known explicitly .",
    "our method relies crucially on the gaussian free field - like fluctuation properties of such infinite volume state .",
    "theorem [ th : sos ] , together with techniques developed in the context of kinetically constrained spin models @xcite , allows us to implement a recursive analysis whose output is an almost diffusive lower bound @xmath30 up to polylog(@xmath2 ) factors for the spectral gap of the sos model with _",
    "unbounded _ heights and zero boundary conditions @xmath31 ; see theorem [ th : gap ] .",
    "our approach can be roughly described as follows . at equilibrium",
    "the interface is macroscopically flat , with maximal height fluctuations much smaller than @xmath2 ( logarithmic in the monotone surface case and of order @xmath4 for sos ) .",
    "the main step in the proof of the mixing time upper bounds is to show that an initial macroscopically non - flat profile approaches the flat equilibrium profile within the correct time .",
    "heuristically , the interface evolves by minimizing the surface tension and therefore feels a drift proportional to the local mean curvature .",
    "a major difficulty encountered in previous approaches is the possible appearance of very large ( up to order @xmath2 ) gradients of the surface height .",
    "our method consists in introducing an auxiliary `` mesoscopic '' dynamics which approximately follows the mean curvature flow , such that large gradients are absent in the initial condition and are very unlikely to be created at later times .",
    "the key point is that , thanks to monotonicity and coupling considerations , the original dynamics converges to equilibrium faster than the auxiliary one .",
    "the study of the mesoscopic dynamics involves a local analysis of the relaxation of a mesoscopic portion of the interface , whose size @xmath32 depends i ) on the current local mean curvature @xmath33 of the surface at time @xmath34 and ii ) on the size of equilibrium height fluctuations . for the monotone surface case it turns out that one has to choose @xmath35 and for the sos model @xmath36 ( in both cases modulo polylogarithmic factors ) .",
    "we refer to section [ sec : scale ] for a more detailed explanation of the strategy which leads to the choice of the different scales in the two models .",
    "note that , since the evolution tends to a profile with vanishing mean curvature , @xmath37 grows with time and becomes much larger than the initial value @xmath38 when equilibrium is approached .",
    "one key input is to prove that the equilibration time within such mesoscopic regions is of the correct order @xmath39 : this result can be obtained following recent important progress in @xcite for monotone surfaces and in @xcite for sos ( both use the peres - winkler inequalities and wilson s argument @xcite in an essential way ) .",
    "the other key point , which is the main contribution of this work , is to show that the mesoscopic dynamics is dominated with high probability by the deterministic mean curvature evolution of a macroscopic smooth profile with the appropriate boundary conditions .    in this paper we do not focus on mixing time _",
    "lower bounds_. let us however mention that , for the monotone surface dynamics , under natural assumptions mentioned in remark [ rem : natural ] below , one can apply ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) to obtain a lower bound of order @xmath40 for the mixing time .",
    "similarly , for the sos model it is known that the spectral gap is at most of order @xmath25 @xcite , which by standard inequalities directly implies a lower bound of order @xmath41 for @xmath8 .",
    "we believe our method could potentially work for a wide range of stochastic interface dynamics models where mean curvature motion is expected to occur macroscopically .",
    "an example that comes naturally to mind is the dynamics of domino tilings of the plane , for which at present only non - optimal polynomial upper bounds on @xmath8 are available @xcite .",
    "a real challenge is on the other hand to prove that @xmath42 for the monotone surface dynamics when the boundary height is _ not _ approximately planar , in which case the equilibrium shape is not macroscopically flat and arctic circle - type phenomena can occur @xcite . while in principle our idea of mesoscopic auxiliary dynamics could be adapted to this case too , what is missing here are precise , finite-@xmath2 equilibrium estimates on height fluctuations and on the rate of convergence of the equilibrium average height to its macroscopic limit .",
