    "quantum metrology offers the promise to measure certain parameters with a higher precision than using classical resources only .",
    "more precisely , given a physical process @xmath0 depending on a parameter @xmath1 , one can estimate @xmath1 with higher accuracy , if the process is applied to an entangled state of @xmath2 particles instead of @xmath2 separate particles in individual states . in the typical case , @xmath1 is a phase acquired by a unitary evolution , which can , using entanglement , be determined with an accuracy of @xmath3 , the so - called heisenberg limit ( hl ) .",
    "contrary to that , with separable states the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xmath4 is an upper bound on the precision @xcite .    in any real application , however , errors are unavoidable and one has to ask whether quantum metrology offers an advantage even in the presence of noise and decoherence . here , it was realised that noise can have a detrimental effect @xcite .",
    "in fact , for generic noise models and estimation schemes , where the same unitary evolution is applied to all particles , it was shown that the heisenberg scaling can not be retained .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that quantum effects do not offer any advantage anymore , but it shows that one has to consider specific situations and noise models in detail , in order to find the best quantum mechanical estimation scheme .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that for very specific models the heisenberg scaling can still be achieved @xcite and also ideas from quantum error correction can be used to fight against noise @xcite .",
    "finally , for specific noise models the optimal states for large numbers of particles have been determined @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate phase and frequency estimation under the effect of collective phase noise , which is a typical noise model for ion trap experiments @xcite . in the first part , we consider the standard linear estimation scheme and optimize the initial probe states under collective rotations .",
    "it turns out that even with this optimization the states do not provide a significant advantage over separable states , hence new concepts are needed . in the second part , we consider differential interferometry ( di ) as such an alternative concept . in",
    "di the time evolution is only applied to a subset of the particles , while the other particles are used to monitor the noise only .",
    "this means that the known negative results @xcite do not apply .",
    "we use the scenario of di as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown already that di can sometimes be useful for suppressing decoherence . for our noise model ,",
    "we present a detailed study which states are optimal and how many particles should be used for applying the time evolution and how many particles should be used for monitoring the noise only .",
    "it turns out that a heisenberg scaling can be reached again .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss possible implementations of di using trapped ions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the metrology scheme and the noise model that we are using . in section iii",
    "we determine the optimized states for standard interferometry using our noise model .",
    "section iv deals with differential interferometry .",
    "we explain the scheme and discuss the optimal states .",
    "we also comment on possible experimental implementations .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss further open problems . in the appendix we present detailed calculations and derivations .",
    "in standard metrological schemes ( see fig .  [ fig : metrology ]  ( a ) ) , @xmath2 particles are in an initial state @xmath5 . a time evolution depending on the parameter @xmath1 acts on each particle individually .",
    "the goal is to estimate this parameter @xmath1 by measurements . in classical schemes ,",
    "the particles are only classically correlated and therefore initially in a separable state . the variance for measuring @xmath1",
    "is bounded by the so called standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xmath4 . in quantum metrology the particles can be entangled . with such states the heisenberg limit ( hl ) @xmath3 can be reached theoretically @xcite . as a consequence , there is an enhancement in precision by a factor of @xmath6 by using entangled states .",
    "however , in realistic experiments , noise affects the particles and reduces the entanglement and thereby the enhancement of using entangled states .",
    "these noise effects arises because the probe system can not be perfectly separated from their environment .",
    "a possible effect is that the energy splitting of the two - level system depends on the noise influenced by the environment .",
    "this causes the level splitting to fluctuate in time .",
    "an example of such noise effects are magnetic field fluctuations in systems with magnetic field dependent energy splitting . in the simplest noise model ,",
    "all qubits receive the same fluctuations , this is also called collective phase noise .    collective phase noise is , besides micro motion , the main source of noise in experiments with ions as described in ref . @xcite . in experiments with atoms ,",
    "the trapping potential is fluctuating in time .",
    "those fluctuations also causes collective phase noise , which is besides particle loss the main source of noise in experiments with atoms . without loss of generality",
    "we assume magnetic field fluctuations in time as noise source in this paper .",
    "however , noise due to trapping potential fluctuations can be described with the same noise model .    in a realistic experiment ,",
