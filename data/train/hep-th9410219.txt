    "the systematic investigation of string dynamics in curved spacetimes started in ref.@xcite , has revealed new insights and new physical phenomena with respect to string propagation in flat spacetime ( and with respect to quantum fields in curved spacetime ) @xcite .",
    "these results are relevant both for fundamental ( quantum ) strings and for cosmic strings , which behave , essentially , in a classical way .    among the cosmological backgrounds , de sitter spacetime occupies a special place .",
    "on one hand , it is relevant for inflation , and on the other hand , string propagation turns out to be particularly interesting there @xcite-@xcite .    recently",
    ", a novel feature for strings in de sitter spacetime was found : exact multi - string solutions .",
    "that is , one single world - sheet generically describes two strings @xcite , several strings @xcite , and even _ infinitely many _ @xcite ( different and independent ) strings .",
    "circular strings are specially suited for detailed investigation . since the string equations of motion become separable , one has to deal with non - linear ordinary differential equations instead of non - linear partial differential equations . in order to obtain generic non - circular string solutions the full power of the inverse scattering method",
    "is needed in de sitter spacetime @xcite .",
    "cosmological spacetimes are not ricci flat and hence they are not string vacua even at first order in @xmath13 .",
    "strings are there non - critical and quantization will presumably lead to features like ghost states .",
    "no definite answer is available by now to such conformal anomaly effects .",
    "we think it is important in this context to investigate the quantum aspects in the semi - classical regime , where anomaly effects are practically irrelevant .",
    "semi - clasically , in this context , means the regime in which @xmath14 where @xmath6 is the hubble constant .",
    "we proceed in this paper to semi - classically quantize time - periodic string solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes after dealing with minkowski spacetime as an instructive exercise .",
    "time - periodic string solutions here include all the circular string solutions in minkowski and anti de sitter spacetimes , as well as the oscillating string solutions in de sitter spacetime .    in this paper , we also complete the physical characterization of all circular string solutions found recently in de sitter @xcite and in anti de sitter spacetimes @xcite , by computing the corresponding equations of state from the exact string dynamics .",
    "the circular string solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes depend on an elliptic modulus @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . from the exact solutions we find their energy momentum tensor .",
    "it turns out to have the perfect fluid form with an equation of state @xmath17 where @xmath1 in general is time - dependent and depends on the elliptic modulus as well .",
    "we analyze the equation of state for all circular string solutions in de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes . in de sitter spacetime , for strings expanding from zero radius towards infinity , the equation of state changes continuosly from the ultra - relativistic matter - type when @xmath18 ( in @xmath19 dimensions ) to the unstable string - type , @xmath20 when @xmath21 on the other hand , for an oscillating stable string in de sitter spacetime , @xmath1 oscillates between @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24.$ ] averaging over one oscillation period , the pressure _",
    "vanishes_. that is , these stable string solutions actually describe _ cold matter_.    in anti de sitter spacetime , only oscillating ( stable ) circular string solutions exist .",
    "we find that @xmath1 oscillates between @xmath22 and @xmath25 i.e. the equation of state `` oscillates '' between @xmath26 and @xmath27 this is similar to the situation in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "when averaging over an oscillation period in anti de sitter spacetime , we find that @xmath1 takes values from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for the allowed range of the elliptic modulus .",
    "that is , the average pressure over one oscillation period is always _ positive _ in anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "in general , positive pressure characterizes the regime in which the string radius is small relative to the string maximal size , while negative pressure is characteristic for the regime in which the string radius is large . in minkowski spacetime , the two regimes are of equal `` size '' , in the sense that the average pressure is identically zero .",
    "the influence of the spacetime curvature is among other effects , to modify the relative `` size '' of these two regimes .    in order to semi - classically quantize these string solutions ,",
    "we compute the classical action @xmath30 as a function of the string mass @xmath31 : @xmath32 where we choose @xmath33 as the period in the * physical * time variable ( in general different from the world - sheet time ) .",
    "the quantization condition takes the form : @xmath34 in minkowski spacetime , this formula reproduces the exact mass spectrum except for the intercept [ see eq.([sces ] ) ] .",
    "we find for de sitter ( anti de sitter ) spacetime that the mass is exactly proportional to the square - root of the casimir operator @xmath35 of the @xmath4-de sitter [ @xmath5-anti de sitter ] group : @xmath36 in figures 4 and 5 we give parametric plots of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath24 $ ] for de sitter spacetime and for @xmath39 for anti de sitter spacetime , respectively .",
    "a linear approximation turns out to be rather accurate for de sitter spacetime : @xmath40 this is different from the mass spectrum in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the level spacing is however still approximately constant , but the levels are more separated than in minkowski spacetime . in de sitter spacetime",
    "there is only a _ finite _ number of levels as can be seen from fig.4 .",
    "the number of quantized circular string states can be estimated to be : @xmath41 it is interesting to compare this result with the number of particle states obtained using canonical quantization @xcite .",
    "one finds in this way a maximum number of states : @xmath42 which is very close to the semi - classical value ( [ numm ] ) .",
    "it must be noticed that in de sitter spacetime , these states can _ decay _ quantum mechanically due to the possibility of quantum mechanical tunneling through the potential barrier , see fig.1b .",
    "semi - classically , the decay probability is however highly suppressed for @xmath43 and for any value of the elliptic modulus @xmath44 except near @xmath45 where the barrier disappears , and for which the tunneling probability is close to one .    in anti de sitter spacetime",
    "arbitrary high mass states exist .",
    "the quantization of the high mass states yields : @xmath46 thus the ( mass)@xmath47 grows like @xmath48 and the level spacing grows proportionally to @xmath49 this is a completely different behaviour as compared to minkowski spacetime where the level spacing is constant .",
    "exactly the same result was recently found , using canonical quantization of generic strings in anti de sitter spacetime @xcite .",
    "the physical consequences , especially the non - existence of a critical string temperature ( hagedorn temperature ) , of this kind of behaviour is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .    for both de sitter and anti de sitter",
    "spacetimes we find thus a very strong agreement between the results obtained using canonical quantization , based on generic string solutions ( string perturbation approach ) , and the results obtained using the semi - classical approach , based on oscillating circular string configurations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the time - periodic string solutions in minkowski , de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "we derive the corresponding equations of state and give the physical interpretation in the various regimes for the different kinds of string solutions ( oscillating and non - oscillating ) .",
    "in section 3 we proceed to quantize the oscillating strings semi - classically , deriving the quantum mass spectrum , and we compare with the results obtained using canonical quantization .",
    "a summary of our results and conclusions is presented in section 4 and in tables i , ii .",
    "the evolution of circular strings in curved spacetimes has recently been discussed from both gravitational and cosmological points of view [ 3 - 9 ] . for completeness and comparison",
    "we first consider flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "we then investigate the string dynamics in de sitter spacetime ( negative local gravity ) and finally consider anti de sitter spacetime ( positive local gravity ) .",
    "we investigate the effects of positive and negative local gravity in the energy - momentum tensor of such circular strings .",
    "the string equations of motion and constraints for a circular string are most easily solved using static coordinates : @xmath50 for simplicity we consider the string dynamics in a 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "all our solutions can however be embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , where they will describe plane circular strings .",
    "the circular string ansatz ( @xmath51 ) leads , after one integration , to the following set of first order ordinary differential equations : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a non - negative integration constant with the dimension of ( mass)@xmath55 the left hand side of eq.(2.3 ) is in the form of `` kinetic '' @xmath56 `` potential '' energy .",
    "the potential is given by @xmath57 , where : @xmath58 properties like energy and pressure of the strings are more conveniently discussed in comoving ( cosmological ) coordinates : @xmath59 including as special cases minkowski , de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes : @xmath60 the spacetime energy - momentum tensor is given in @xmath19 dimensional spacetime by : @xmath61 after integration over a spatial volume that completely encloses the string @xcite , the energy - momentum tensor for a circular string takes the form of a fluid : @xmath62 where , in the comoving coordinates ( 2.4 ) : @xmath63 @xmath64 represent the string energy and pressure , respectively .      in this case eqs.([ciruno ] ) , ( [ cirdos ] ) are solved by : @xmath65 i.e. the string radius follows a pure harmonic motion with period in world - sheet time @xmath66 the energy and pressure , eqs.(2.7 ) , ( 2.8 ) , are : @xmath67 @xmath68 the energy is constant while the pressure depends on the string radius . for @xmath69 ,",
    "that is when the string is collapsed , we find the equation of state @xmath70 correspondig to ultra - relativistic matter in @xmath19 dimensions . for @xmath71 ,",
    "that is when the string has its maximal size , the pressure is negative and we find @xmath27 this is the same equation of state that was found for extremely unstable strings in inflationary universes @xcite .",
    "the circular string thus oscillates between these two limiting types of equation of state .",
    "this illustrates that instantaneous negative pressure is a generic feature of strings , not only for unstable strings in inflationary universes , but even for stable oscillating strings in flat minkowski spacetime . even in flat minkowski spacetime",
    "we see that there is a positive pressure regime ( when the string radius is small relative to its maximal size ) and a negative pressure regime ( when the string radius is large ) . for the circular strings in minkowski spacetime the two regimes are of equal size in the sense that the average pressure equals zero ( as can be easily shown by integrating eq.(2.11 ) over a full period ) .",
    "the strings thus , in average , obey an equation of state of the cold matter type .",
    "the influence of the curvature of spacetime is , among other effects , to change the relative ` size ' of the positive pressure regime to the negative pressure regime , as we will see in the following subsections .      in de sitter spacetime",
    "the solution of eqs.(2.2 ) , ( 2.3 ) involves elliptic functions . as can be seen from the potential , fig.1b , the dynamics in de sitter spacetime is completely different from the dynamics in minkowski and anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "the inflation of the background here gives rise to a finite barrier implying the existence of oscillating strings as well as contracting and expanding strings , whose exact dynamics was discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the energy and pressure have been discussed in ref.@xcite . in this subsection",
    "we further analyze the string energy and pressure in de sitter spacetime .",
    "the coordinate transformation relating the line elements ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.4 ) , in the case of de sitter spacetime , is given by : @xmath72 @xmath73 the energy and pressure then take the form : @xmath74 @xmath75 both the energy and the pressure now depend on the string radius @xmath76 and the velocity @xmath77 the latter can however be eliminated using eq.(2.3 ) .",
    "let us first consider a string expanding from @xmath78 towards infinity .",
    "this corresponds to a string with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , see fig.1b . for @xmath78",
    "we find @xmath81 and @xmath82 thus the equation of state @xmath83 this is the same result as in minkowski spacetime , i.e. like ultra - relativistic matter . as the string expands , the energy soon starts to increase while the pressure starts to decrease and becomes negative , see fig.2 . for @xmath84",
    "we find @xmath85 and @xmath86 thus , not surprisingly , we have recovered the equation of state of extremely unstable strings @xcite , @xmath27    now consider an oscillating string , i.e. a string with @xmath87 in the region to the left of the potential barrier , fig.1b .",
    "the equation of state near @xmath78 is the same as for the expanding string , but now the string has a maximal radius : @xmath88 for @xmath89 we find : @xmath90 corresponding to a perfect fluid type equation of state : @xmath91 notice that @xmath24 $ ] with @xmath92 decribing a string at the bottom of the potential while @xmath45 decribes a string oscillating between @xmath78 and the top of the potential barrier ( in this case the string actually only makes one oscillation @xcite ) . for @xmath93 the equation of state ( 2.18 ) near",
    "the maximal radius reduces to @xmath94 which is the same result we found in minkowski spacetime . in the other limit @xmath95",
    "we find , however , @xmath96 corresponding to cold matter .    for the oscillating strings we can also calculate the average values of energy and pressure by integrating eqs.(2.14 ) , ( 2.15 ) over a full period , fig.3 .",
    "since a @xmath97-integral can be converted into a @xmath76-integral , using eq.(2.3 ) , the average values can be obtained without using the exact @xmath97-dependence of the string radius [ the solution of eq.(2.3 ) ] .",
    "the average energy becomes : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the period in the world - sheet time @xmath97 and @xmath100 is the complete elliptic integral of the third kind .",
    "the average pressure can be expressed here as a combination of complete elliptic integrals of the third kind .",
    "numerical evaluation gives zero with high accuracy .",
    "we have checked in addition that the first orders in the expansion in the elliptic modulus @xmath15 identically vanish .",
    "we conclude that the average pressure is zero as in minkowski spacetime .",
    "thus , in average the _ oscillating strings _ describe _ cold matter_.      as an example of a frw - universe with positive local gravity we now consider anti de sitter spacetime . here",
    "the circular string potential goes to infinity even faster than in minkowski spacetime , see fig.1c , so we can only have oscillating string solutions .",
    "the maximal string radius is given by : @xmath101 that can take any non - negative value .",
    "the comoving coordinates , eq.(2.4 ) , are in the case of anti de sitter spacetime given by : @xmath102 @xmath103.\\ ] ] the energy and pressure can be written as : @xmath104 @xmath105 ^ 2- h^2r^2(1+h^2r^2)[(1+h^2r^2)\\cos^2ht - h^2r^2 ] } { 2[h^2r\\dot{r}\\sin ht+h\\sqrt{b}\\alpha ' \\cos ht]\\sqrt{1+h^2r^2 } \\sqrt{(1+h^2r^2)\\cos^2ht - h^2r^2}}.\\ ] ] using eqs.(2.2 ) , ( 2.3 ) we can then write down the energy and pressure explicitly as functions of the string radius @xmath106 only . for the present purposes it is however sufficient to consider some limiting cases .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the parameter @xmath16 : @xmath107 for @xmath108 the string oscillates near the bottom of the potential , while the other extreme corresponds to @xmath109 for @xmath78 we find : @xmath110 thus the ultra - relativistic matter equation of state .    for @xmath89",
    "we find : @xmath111 corresponding to the equation of state @xmath27 this is exactly as in minkowski spacetime : the string oscillates between the two limiting types of equation of state , @xmath70 and @xmath27 a new phenomenon appears , however , when we calculate the average values over a full period .",
    "the average energy becomes : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the period in the world - sheet time @xmath97 and @xmath100 is the complete elliptic integral of the third kind .",
    "the average pressure for oscillating strings in anti de sitter spacetime is , contrary to minkowski and de sitter spacetime , non - zero .",
    "no simple analytic expression for it has been found for arbitrary @xmath114 the equation of state is of perfect fluid type @xmath115 where @xmath1 depends on @xmath114 approximate results can be obtained in the two extreme limits . for @xmath116 we find : @xmath117 while eq.(2.28 ) gives : @xmath118 and therefore : @xmath119 in the limit @xmath120 we find : @xmath121 and from eq.(2.28 ) : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "this corresponds to : @xmath124 numerical evaluation of @xmath125 and @xmath126 shows that @xmath1 monotonically grows from @xmath127 till @xmath128 when @xmath16 grows from zero to @xmath129 so that the average pressure is always positive .",
    "this concludes our analysis of the various types of equation of state for circular strings in minkowski , de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the results are summarized in table i.",
    "in this section we perform a semi - classical quantization of the circular string configurations discussed in the previous section .",
    "we use an approach developed in field theory by dashen et .",
    "@xcite , based on the stationary phase approximation of the partition function .",
    "the method can be only used for time - periodic solutions of the classical equations of motion . in our string problem , these solutions however , include all the circular string solutions in minkowski and in anti de sitter spacetimes , as well as the oscillating circular strings ( @xmath130 c.f .",
    "subsection 2.2 ) in de sitter spacetime .",
    "the result of the stationary phase integration is expressed in terms of the function : @xmath131 where @xmath30 is the action of the classical solution , @xmath31 is the mass and the period @xmath132 is implicitly given by : @xmath133 in string theory we must choose @xmath33 to be the period in a physical time variable .",
    "for example , when a light cone gauge exists , @xmath33 is the period in @xmath134 the bound state quantization condition then becomes @xcite : @xmath135 for @xmath12 ` large ' .",
    "the method has been successfully used in many cases from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory . for integrable field theories",
    "the semi - classical quantization happens in fact , to be exact .",
    "it must be noticed that string theory in de sitter spacetime is exactly integrable @xcite .    to demonstrate the method and to fix the normalization we first consider the circular strings in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "we then perform the same analysis for de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes , and then after , we compare with approximate results obtained using canonical quantization @xcite .",
    "the string action in the conformal gauge in minkowski spacetime is given by : @xmath136 where the world - sheet coordinate @xmath137 runs from @xmath138 to @xmath33 .",
    "that is , @xmath139 in this parametrization the circular string solution ( [ cirmin ] ) takes the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 is an arbitrary constant [ @xmath142 in the notation of eq.(2.9 ) ] and @xmath33 became the period in the @xmath97 variable too . for this solution in minkowski spacetime",
    ", we find from eq.([act ] ) : @xmath143 equation ( [ extre ] ) then takes the form : @xmath144 and then the quantization condition ( [ concua ] ) yields : @xmath145 we must identify the mass with the variable conjugated to the physical time @xmath146 . since @xmath147 is conjugated to @xmath97 and @xmath148 , @xmath149 is the string mass .",
    "therefore the semiclassical string spectrum results : @xmath150 if we subtract the intercept @xmath151 in eq.([sces ] ) this is the well - known ( exact ) mass formula for closed bosonic strings in flat minkowski spacetime .      using the notation introduced in eqs.(2.16 ) , ( 2.17 ) , the oscillating strings in de sitter spacetime are given by @xcite : @xmath152\\mid.\\ ] ] eq.(2.2 ) is then integrated to : @xmath153 the period in comoving time , which from eq.(2.12 ) equals the period in static coordinate time , is then given by : @xmath154 notice that the expressions for the periods in the physical time @xmath146 and in the world - sheet time @xmath97 are different .",
    "the period in the physical time can be further rewritten in terms of incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds : @xmath155 where : @xmath156 the classical action over one period becomes : @xmath157 a straightforward calculation gives : @xmath158,\\ ] ] as well as : @xmath159.\\ ] ] then , identifying the string mass @xmath31 as the conjugate to the comoving time @xmath160 eq.(3.2 ) leads to : @xmath161 the string solutions in de sitter spacetime enjoy conserved quantities associated with the @xmath4 rotations on the hyperboloid . using hyperboloid coordinates , the only non - zero component for the circular string solutions under consideration here , is given by @xmath162 @xcite : @xmath163 where @xmath35 is the casimir operator of the group .",
    "hence , the mass is exactly * linear * in @xmath164 @xmath36 the physical meaning of such type of ` linear ' regge trajectory deserves further investigation .    the quantization condition ( 3.3 ) finally gives : @xmath165}{\\sqrt{1+k^2}}\\right]=2\\pi n.\\ ] ] this equation determines a quantization of the parameter @xmath44 which by eq.(3.20 ) gives a quantization of the mass . a full parametric plot of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath24 $ ] is shown in fig.4 . in the whole @xmath166range a good approximation",

    "the level spacing is however still approximately constant , but the levels are more separated than in minkowski spacetime . in de sitter spacetime",
    "there is only a _",
    "finite _ number of levels as can be seen from fig.4 .",
    "this is due to the _ finite _ height of the potential barrier .",
    "the number of quantized circular string states is easily estimated using eqs.(3.23 ) , ( 3.24 ) and fig.4 : @xmath169 for @xmath14 which is clearly fulfilled in most interesting cases , we get : @xmath170 it should be stressed , however , that these states are not truely stable stationary states because of the possibility of quantum mechanical tunneling through the barrier . the probability of decay is given by : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the euclidean action of the classical solution in the classically forbidden region . defining @xmath173 and @xmath174 we find from eqs.(2.2)-(2.3 ) : @xmath175 @xmath176",

    "let us now return to the number of states , eq.(3.27 ) .",

    "<S> the string mass is @xmath2 being the casimir operator , @xmath3 of the @xmath4-ds [ @xmath5-ads ] group , and @xmath6 is the hubble constant . </S>",

    "<S> the level spacing grows with @xmath12 in ads spacetime , while is approximately constant ( although larger than in minkowski spacetime ) in ds spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the massive states in ds spacetime decay through tunnel effect and the semi - classical decay probability is computed . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - classical quantization of _ exact _ ( circular ) strings and the canonical quantization of generic string perturbations around the string center of mass strongly agree . </S>"
