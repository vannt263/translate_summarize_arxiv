    "decays of heavy mesons have been recognized recently as important sources of information about scalar resonances , since the e791 experiment has produced solid evidence for a broad scalar - isoscalar state in @xmath8 @xcite , know as the @xmath9 . in the case of the reaction we are concerned with , namely @xmath1 , the e791 group included in their fit another scalar state , known as the @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) , and concluded that this resonance was the dominant source of @xmath0-wave @xmath12 pairs@xcite .",
    "this represented a turn point in our understanding of this reaction , which was hitherto thought to be dominated by the non - resonant background .",
    "the existence of the @xmath10 was then confirmed in a different approach by focus @xcite and by the new high statistics results from cleo @xcite .",
    "empirical information about the parameters of these resonances , especially the position of their poles in the complex energy plane , can only be obtained after analyses of large amounts of data organized into dalitz plots .",
    "low - energy mesons correspond to gentle deviations from the qcd vacuum and tend to be highly collective states , as indeed happens with pions or kaons , which are large objects . in the case of low - energy scalar resonances , one is entitled to expect that the influence of the vacuum will be a truly overwhelming one .",
    "this is probably one of the reasons why they are so broad and prove to be so elusive .",
    "dalitz plots of @xmath13-meson decays into three pseudoscalars usually contain several @xmath0- and @xmath14-wave resonances@xcite , which couple by means of final state interactions ( fsis ) .",
    "this makes the disentangling of individual resonance properties both very involved and strongly dependent on particular forms of trial functions adopted .",
    "theoretical anstze employed in data interpretation usually rely on breit - wigner expressions , which proved to work well in many instances .",
    "a popular ansatz for the trial function has the form = a_0 e^i_0 _ 0 +",

    "these adjusted parameters acquire the status of empirical quantities .    in the case of @xmath18 scattering",
    ", the fact is well established that the lowest pole of the amplitude is located roughly at @xmath19 gev , whereas the @xmath0-wave phase shift reaches @xmath20 around @xmath21 gev .",
    "these findings are clearly at odds with the traditional use of breit - wigner expressions .",
    "an explanation for these seemingly paradoxical results was provided by colangelo , gasser and leutwyler@xcite , who have shown that chiral symmetry requires a compromise between the polynomial nature of the amplitude at very low - energies and the vanishing of its real part at @xmath22 , which is responsible for a large shift in the pole position .",
    "this kind of feature is inherent to the isoscalar channel .",
    "the resonance , which is a non - leading chiral effect , must always coexist with an important polynomial in @xmath3 . in the framework of chiral symmetry , the first two terms in eq.([1.1 ] ) , namely @xmath23 $ ] , are not suited for describing low - energy interactions .",
    "the use of this kind of trial function is problematic and may give rise to results which are not reliable .",
    "the extraction of information from experiments involving scalar resonances must be performed in the best theoretical framework possible , as the quality of results for masses and coupling constants depend on the anstze employed . in this work",
    "we propose an alternative form for the low - energy sector of the trial function , which can be used as a tool in analyses of the decay @xmath24 .",
    "our motivation for choosing this particular reaction is two - fold .",
    "the first one is that scalar resonances in the final state occur just in the @xmath25 subsystem , the number of possible couplings is relatively small , and the problem is simplified . the second is the availability of recent data analyses on this process , which could allow the testing of our results .",
    "nevertheless , the general lines adopted here can be extended to other systems in a straightforward manner .",
    "our theoretical model is based on standard @xmath2 effective chiral lagrangians incorporating scalar resonances@xcite .",
    "we are also concerned with the presence of phases in theoretical anstze , which are sometimes employed with no visible physical meaning . in the realm of two - body systems , the dynamical origin of phases",
    "is well understood .",
    "in particular , it is known that two - body rescattering gives rise to the elastic phase shift @xmath4 .",
    "when resonances are present , this phase is shared with the so called production amplitude , as dictated by watson s theorem @xcite .",
    "we show , in the sequence , that another phase is also present in the @xmath26 decay considered here , associated with two - meson intermediate states .",
    "the theoretical description of a heavy - meson decay into three pseudoscalars is necessarily complex .",
    "nevertheless , we have made an effort to produce final expressions which incorporate a compromise between reliability and simplicity , so that they could be employed directly in data analyses .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the basic lagrangians , which are used in the description of both the primary weak vertex and final state interactions .",
    "the former is discussed in section iii , whereas the latter are discussed in sections iv , v and vi .",
    "these results are assembled in section vii , where our main results are presented and analyzed . in section viii",
    ", we display individual predictions from the various components of the decay amplitude in dalitz plots , so as to produce a feeling of their dynamical content .",
    "finally a summary and comprehensive conclusions are presented in section ix .",
    "details concerning kinematical variables , the form of the two - body propagator and background interactions are left to appendices .",
    "the reaction @xmath27 involves both weak and strong processes .",
    "the former are associated with the isospin conserving quark transition @xmath28 , whereas the latter occur in final state interactions involving both pseudoscalar mesons and their resonances . in order to keep approximations under control ,",
    "we remain , as much as possible , within the single theoretical framework provided by a chiral effective field theory .",
    "this choice is also motivated by the fact that we are concerned mostly with the low - energy sector of the trial function .",
    "meson - meson interactions are described by the chiral @xmath2 lagrangian at @xmath29 given by gasser and leutwyler@xcite , whereas couplings of scalar resonances to pseudoscalar mesons are taken from the work of ecker , gasser , pich and de rafael@xcite . keeping only relevant terms",
