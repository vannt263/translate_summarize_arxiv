    "a diluted sheet of be acceptors is introduced into the gaas layer at @xmath10 = 30 nm from the interface .",
    "the photoluminescence analyzed originated from transitions between the 2deg and photo excited holes bound to be acceptors .",

    "the corresponding optical selection rules are shown in figure [ jl1]a .",
    "in such a case , the degree of circular polarization of the luminescence , @xmath4 , is determined only by the magnetic field and the temperature ( @xmath16 ) : the magnetic field determines the value of the zeeman splitting of the electron and hole levels while the temperature determines their occupation .",

    "the origin of the present paper was an observation of a dependence of @xmath4 on the concentration of the 2deg ( @xmath5 ) which can not be explained on the basis of the selection rules shown in figure [ jl1]a . to explain the effect observed , we discuss two mechanisms which are related to the heterostructure electric field and lead to selection rules shown in figure [ jl1]b .",
    "the first one is the stark effect on a photo excited hole bound to be acceptor .",
    "the second mechanism is an in - plane anisotropy of optical transitions induced by a low symmetry of the heterostructure potential .",

    "we argue that the anisotropy appears due to conduction band electron wavefunctions , and not wavefunctions of holes taking part in the optical transition . within a phenomenological model we derive appropriate selection rules shown in figure [ jl1]b .",

    "is created in a heterostructure quantum well due to doping of the algaas barrier with shallow si donors .",
    "the photoluminescence ( pl ) is excited by a laser beam and some of photo excited holes are captured by acceptors in the @xmath0-layer .",

    "here we focus only on the radiative recombination of 2d electrons with holes bound to acceptors in the @xmath0-layer .",
    "since this is the only optical transition analyzed in this paper , the notion `` hole '' will always have the meaning of a hole bound to an ionized acceptor in the @xmath0-layer .    if the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 2deg plane , the electron density of states is quantized into landau levels ( lls ) and the degeneracy of the hole ground state is totally removed .",
    "in such a case , the pl arising from the recombination of 2d electrons with holes is polarized . the degree of circular polarization @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are intensities of the @xmath18 and @xmath17 components of the luminescence , respectively .",
    "there are two factors that contribute to @xmath4 : polarization of the 2deg and polarization of the holes .",
    "let us consider an even electron filling factor when the electron gas is composed of an equal number of electrons with the spin up and spin down .",
    "then , @xmath4 is determined by the polarization of holes only , since the electron gas is unpolarized .",
    "this is the case considered in the present paper : the polarization of the luminescence observed is caused by a thermal distribution of holes on acceptor levels split by the magnetic field .",
    "tuning the 2deg concentration can be achieved by the electrical polarization of a semi - transparent electrode prepared on the sample surface .",
    "we use this possibility to perform luminescence measurements as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath3 , and we show that @xmath4 depends on @xmath5 when @xmath3 and @xmath16 are constant .",

    "the measurements were carried out in an optical helium cryostat supplied with a 5 t split - coil .",

    "the photomultiplier signal was amplified and directed to a photon counter .",
    "a semi - transparent au gate electrode and an ohmic contact were fabricated on the sample surface and the concentration of the 2deg was tuned by polarizing the gate in the backward direction .",

    "corresponding @xmath18 and @xmath17 signals are proportional in the whole time domain , both within the laser pulse , and after the pulse end .",
    "the degree of polarization does not depend on time ( within the time resolution of the present experiment ) which indicates that the system is stationary and time - resolved polarization measurements give the same value of @xmath4 as cw measurements .",
    "we used this fact to analyze polarization data obtained from cw measurements which essentially improved the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the fact that the system investigated is stationary does not mean that the distribution of holes on acceptor levels correspond to the temperature of the helium bath surrounding the sample .",

    ", we can assume that photoexcited holes are distributed on the acceptor levels according to an equilibrium thermal distribution corresponding to the helium bath temperature of 1.6 k.    the problem of distribution of electrons is avoided in the present considerations because we take into account the luminescence originating from fully occupied landau levels only .",

    "we showed that the long - range heterostructure potential is also too weak to mix hole levels significantly .",
    "other mixing mechanisms , like the internal stress or stress - related piezoelectric effects , even if present , do not depend on the electron concentration .",

    "this means that a perturbation of the valence band , and in consequence , of the conduction band , increases with @xmath5 . also , when @xmath5 increases , the heterostructure well becomes narrower , electron wavefunctions shift towards the interface and the influence of the localized interface potential on the electron states increases .",
    "the latter mechanism should lead to much stronger effects in the case of the single interface in the heterostructure investigated in comparison to quantum wells .",
    "the reason is that in quantum wells of the @xmath7 symmetry , contributions of the two interfaces enter with opposite signs and partially cancel each other .",

    "the symmetry lowering of conduction band states results from the perturbation of the valence band by a long - range heterostructure electric field and the localized interface potential .",
    "measurements on heterostructures with different barrier height could help to separate these two contributions .",
    "this is because the role of the localized interface potential should strongly increase with lowering the barrier height due to an exponential increase of penetration of the barrier by electron wavefunctions .",
    "low temperature polarized magnetoluminescence experiments on a high quality gaas / algaas heterostructure with be acceptor @xmath0-layer incorporated into the gaas channel were carried out . a metallic gate on the sample surface allowed to tune the 2deg concentration in the heterostructure .",

    "we observed that @xmath4 decreases with the increase of @xmath5 . in principle , this effect can be explained by the stark effect on be - localized hole and/or by an in - plane anisotropy of optical transitions , reflecting the @xmath7 symmetry of the heterstructure potential .",
    "an analysis of the stark effect was based on a group theory hamiltonian , with taking into account results of self - consistent calculations of the heterostructure electric field .",
    "it was shown that the stark effect can be neglected in the heterstructure investigated , which led to the conclusion that the effect responsible for the @xmath6 dependence is a low symmetry of the heterostructure potential .",
    "we argued that be - localized holes are of the @xmath8 symmetry which led us to the conclusion that the optical anisotropy is related to a low symmetry of the conduction band electron wavefunctions .",
    "we propose that this symmetry lowering results from a perturbation of the valence band which induces perturbation of the conduction band due to the @xmath137 coupling .",
    "we used symmetry arguments to derive selection rules of optical transitions in the case when the conduction band electrons and holes are of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 symmetry , respectively , and we provided a phenomenological description of the experimental data .    in conclusion , it is proposed that due to a large separation of holes from the interface , the in - plane anisotropy observed is due to lowering of the symmetry of the conduction band electron wavefunctions only .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the symmetry lowering is a perturbation of the valence band states which influences the conduction band states through the @xmath137 coupling .",
    "the increase of the perturbation with @xmath5 is caused by an increase of the heterostructure electric field with @xmath5 .",
