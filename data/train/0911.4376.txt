    "stars with initial masses in the range 0.88  m@xmath5 end their life with a phase of catastrophic mass - loss . during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase",
    ", they develop a superwind leading to mass - loss rates up to 10@xmath7m@xmath5yr@xmath6 .",
    "this superwind enriches the ism with newly synthesized elements .",
    "the mass - loss mechanism of agb stars is likely due to pulsations from the star and radiation pressure on dust grains .",
    "shocks due to pulsation extend the atmosphere , so that the material ejected by the star becomes dense and cold enough for dust to form . due to its opacity , dust absorbs the radiation from the star and is driven away by radiation pressure , carrying the gas along through friction .",
    "theoretical models ( winters et al .",
    "2000 ) , show that the mass loss evolves from a pulsation driven regime characterized by a low mass - loss rate and a slow expansion velocity to a dust - driven regime with a high mass - loss rate and a high expansion velocity ( @xmath25km.s@xmath6 ) .    studying",
    "the effect of metallicity on the mass - loss process is important to understand the formation of dust around agb stars in the early universe . at low metallicity ,",
    "less seeds are present for dust formation , so one might expect dust formation to be less efficient and thus the mass - loss rates to be lower .    theoretical work by bowen & willson ( 1991 ) predicts that for metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath8 dust - driven winds fail , and the wind must stay pulsation - driven .",
    "however , observational evidence for any metallicity dependence is still very limited ( zijlstra 2004 ) .",
    "more recent observational ( groenewegen et al .",
    "2007 ) and theoretical works ( wachter et al .  2008 ; mattsson et al . 2008 ) indicate that the mass - loss rates from carbon stars in metal - poor environments are similar to our galaxy .    to obtain the first observational evidence on mass - loss rates at low metallicity ,",
    "we have carried out several surveys with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "these show significant mass - loss rates down to z=1/25 z@xmath9 ( lagadec et al .  2007b ; matsuura et al .   2007 ; sloan et al .",
    "2009 ) , but only for carbon - rich stars .",
    "the current evidence indicates that oxygen - rich stars have lower mass - loss rates at lower metallicities . for carbon stars ,",
    "no evidence for a dependency of mass - loss rate on metallicity has yet been uncovered .",
    "consequently , ( lagadec & zijlstra 2008 ) have proposed that the carbon - rich dust plays an important role in triggering the agb superwind .",
    "the main uncertainty arises from the unknown expansion velocity .",
    "this parameter is needed to convert the density distribution to a mass - loss rate .",
    "the expansion velocity is also in itself a powerful tool .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations ( winters et al .",
    "2000 ) , have shown that radiation - driven winds have expansion velocity in excess of 5kms@xmath6 , while pulsation - driven winds are slower .",
    "there is some evidence that expansion velocities are lower at low metallicity , from measurement of oh masers ( marshall et al .",
    "oh masers are found only in oxygen - rich stars , which appear to have suppressed mass - loss at low metallicities .",
    "we lack equivalent measurements for metal - poor carbon - rich stars , which do reach substantial mass - loss rates . for these ,",
    "the only available velocity tracer is co. currently , extra - galactic stars are too distant for co measurements .",
    "however , there are a number of carbon stars in the galactic halo , which are believed to have similarly low metallicity .",
    "one co measurement exists for a galactic halo star : its expansion velocity has been estimated to be @xmath103.2 kms@xmath6 through the @xmath11co @xmath12 transition ( groenewegen et al .",
    "this is much lower than typical expansion velocities , which are in the range 10 - 40 kms@xmath6 for stars with similar colours , and thus optical depths ( fig.[histo_vexp ] ) .",
    "a large number of metal - poor carbon stars have recently been discovered in the galactic halo ( totten & irwin 1998 ; mauron et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "these stars may have been stripped from the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) , which has a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath13 ( van de bergh 2000 ) .",
    "these stars are the closest metal - poor carbon stars known , and they are bright enough to be detected in co using ground - based millimeter telescopes .    we have carried out observations of six halo carbon stars in the co j @xmath14 transition . here , we report the results of these observations .",

    "all of these stars are spectroscopically confirmed carbon stars .",
    "only the brightest can be detected in the sub - millimeter range .",
    "we selected the six stars with the highest iras 12@xmath16 m flux observable with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt , mauna kea , hawaii ) .",
    "the emission from an agb star at 12@xmath16 m is due to thermal emission from the dust in the envelope .",
    "thus one expects the stars with the largest 12@xmath16 m flux to be the brightest in co. all the observed stars have 3@xmath174 and have thus a similar dust optical depth and a large circumstellar dusty envelope .",
    "table[targets ] describes the observational properties of the selected stars .",
    "one of these stars , iras 12560 + 1656 ( beichman et al .  1990 ) , is the only halo carbon star that had previously been detected in co j@xmath18 ( by groenewegen et al .",

    ", we applied three methods .",
    "two are based on near - infrared colours ; the third is the period - luminosity relationship .",
    "the first method uses the infrared colours of the observed stars , using the relation between m@xmath19 and j@xmath15k determined by sloan et al .",
    "they found from a sample of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) that :    @xmath20    mauron et al .",
    "( 2008 ) compared the near - infrared 2mass photometry of stars in the halo and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and found a different relationship from the one above between j@xmath15k and m@xmath19 .",
    "their relation gives fainter m@xmath19 values at a given j@xmath15k colour than that of sloan et al .",
    ", with the difference increasing with redder colours .",
    "we have recalibrated the relation for the lmc , using the samples of stars confirmed to be carbon - rich with the infrared spectrograph on _ spitzer _ by zijlstra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , buchanan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , leisenring et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and sloan et al .",
    "we find that :    @xmath21    for j@xmath15k colours greater than 2.0 .",
    "this calibration of the j@xmath15k relation is our second method .",
    "[ fig_dist ] compares the smc and lmc calibrations of the relation between m@xmath19 and j@xmath15k .",
    "the scatter in the lmc sample is 0.81 magnitudes about the fitted line , compared to 0.51 magnitudes for the smc sample .",
    "the two fitted lines yield nearly identical distances at j@xmath15k = 2 , but as the colour grows redder , the samples diverge from each other . at j@xmath15k",
    "= 5 , the difference in @xmath22 is a full magnitude . for the colours in our sample , the two methods yield results differening by 0.41 to 0.64 magnitudes , comparable to the spread in the smc sample . the different slopes in the two samples may result from their different metallicities , but that is only speculation on our part .",
    "the third method utilises the period - luminosity relation for carbon miras described by feast et al .",
    "( 2006 ) :    @xmath23    with an uncertainty of 0.24 magnitudes .",
    "we derived the bolometric magnitudes using the equation for bolometric correction derived by whitelock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , after converting all of the photometry to the saao system as described by lagadec et al .",
    "( 2008 ) :    @xmath24    table [ gal ] presents the obtained distances , d@xmath25 , d@xmath26 and d@xmath27 respectively . for those stars without periods ,",
    "the final estimated distance is the average of d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 . for those stars with periods ,",
    "the d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 values bracket d@xmath27 in two of the three cases .",
    "consequently , we first averaged d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 , then averaged the result with d@xmath27 to arrive at our final estimate of the distance .",
    "the uncertainties in the final estimated distances are the the standard deviation of the individual distances .      knowing the distance to the stars and their @xmath28 allows us to study their location in the galaxy .",
    "all six stars examined here have been classified previously as members of the halo , based on their distances from the galactic plane .",
    "our co observations give us velocity information for these stars , which we can compare to galactic rotation models .",
    "table [ gal ] lists the galactic coordinates l and b. fig.[aitoff ] shows the location of our six carbon stars on an aitoff projection .",
    "the dashed line schematically represents the sgr dsph orbit ( ibata et al .",
    "one of our stars , iras12560 + 1656 , lies very close to this orbit .",
    "its @xmath28 is in the range of the observed @xmath28 for stars in the sgr dsph stream .",
    "iras12560 + 1656 very likely belongs to this stream .",
    "our observations are thus certainly the first co observations of an extragalactic agb star .",
    "two other stars , iras16339 - 0317 and iras18120 + 4530 , have large negative @xmath28 , fully consistent with membership in the halo . finally , iras04188 + 0122 , iras08427 + 0338 , and iras11308 - 1020 have a distance , location and @xmath28 consistent with membership in the thick disc .",
    "these three last stars thus have a metallicity between that of the thin galactic disc and the galactic halo , the average metallicity of the thin disc being @xmath10 - 0.17 while the one of the thick disc is @xmath10 - 0.48 ( soubiran et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "our sample thus contains three metal - poor agb stars and three agb stars with intermediate metallicity .",
    "width=13cm , angle=-90]zz - myplot - last1.ps      the present observations allow us to directly measure the expansion velocity for a sample of carbon stars in the halo .",
    "the stars we observed are quite red ( 3@xmath29j@xmath15k@xmath294 ) , and have substantial circumstellar dusty envelopes responsible for the observed reddening .",
    "our measured expansion velocities are in the range 316.5 kms@xmath6 .",
    "the expansion velocity of carbon stars increases during the evolution on the agb ( schoer , 2007 ) , i.e.  when the dusty envelope becomes optically thicker . to compare the expansion velocities we measured in halo carbon stars with carbon stars in the disc",
    ", we took a sample of carbon stars in the disc with colours similar to our sample .",
    "we selected all of the carbon stars with 3@xmath29j@xmath15k@xmath294 in the extensive catalogue of co observations of evolved stars by loup et al .",
    "fig.[histo_vexp ] compares the distribution of expansion velocities in the two samples .",
    "the halo carbon stars clearly have a lower mean expansion velocity .",
    "the three stars in the halo and the sgr dsph stream have @xmath30 in the range 38.5 kms@xmath6 , while the three stars associated with the thick disc have velocities ranging from 11.5 to 16.5 kms@xmath6 .",
    "the latter range is at the low end of expansion velocities for agb stars with similar near - infrared colours in the thin disc .",
    "section [ location ] and [ lowvexp ] have shown that the three stars we observed in the halo and sgr dsph stream have low expansion velocities .",
    "the stars we observed in the thick disc have expansion velocities intermediate between those typically observed in the halo and the thin disc .",
    "this difference could arise from differences in metallicity , with the more metal - poor carbon stars having the slower winds .",
    "mattsson et al .  ( 2008 ) and wachter et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have recently conducted theoretical investigations of the winds from metal - poor carbon stars .",
    "both studies show that metal - poor carbon stars can develop high mass loss rates , leading to the formation of a large dusty envelope , in agreement with spectroscopic observations from _",
    "spitzer _ of agb stars in metal - poor galaxies ( zijlstra et al .  2006 ; sloan et al .  2006 ; groenewegen et al .  2007 ;",

    "2009 ) .",
    "wachter et al .  (",
    "2008 ) predict that the outflow velocities from carbon stars should be lower in metal - poor environments , because of the lower gas - to - dust mass ratio and because the formation of less dust leads to less efficient acceleration of the wind outside of the sonic region .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with our interpretation that the low expansion velocities we have observed in the halo are due to their low metallicities .",
    "hydrodynamical models ( winters et al .",
    "2000 , wachter et al .",
    "2008 ) distinguish two types of models .",
    "model a applies to cases where the radiation pressure on dust is efficient .",
    "mass - loss rates can exceed 10@xmath31m@xmath5yr@xmath6 , and expansion velocities can climb above @xmath105 km@xmath32 .",
    "model b applies to cases where pulsations drive the mass loss . in these cases ,",
    "the mass - loss rates and expansion velocities are smaller .",
    "the mass loss occurs in a two - step process , with stars first losing mass due to pulsations , followed by acceleration due to radiation pressure on the dust grains .",
    "the high mass - loss rate and low expansion velocity of ti  32 does not fit either of these models , possibly because metal - poor carbon stars can develop strong mass - loss from pulsation alone .",
    "we have detected the co j@xmath03@xmath12 in six carbon stars selected as halo stars .",
    "only one carbon star had been detected in co previously .",
    "comparison of the infrared observations and radiative transfer models indicates that these stars are losing mass and producing dust .",
    "their mass - loss rates are larger than their nuclear burning rates , so their final evolution will be driven by this mass - loss phenomenon .",
    "we show that three of the observed stars are certainly members of the thick disc , while one is in the sgr dsph stream and two are in the halo .",
    "the co observation of the sgr dsph stream star are thus the first identified millimetre observations of an extragalactic agb star .",
    "the expansion velocity we determined from our co observations are lower than those of carbon stars in the thin disc with similar near - infrared colours .",
    "the observed carbon stars with the lowest expansion velocities are halo or sgr dsph stream carbon stars .",
    "there is a strong indication that the expansion winds are lower in metal - poor environments , which agrees with recent theoretical models ( wachter et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "so far , the effect of metallicity on the mass - loss from carbon - rich agb stars has studied primarily from infrared observations of agb stars in local group galaxies , mostly with the _ spitzer space telescope_. infrared observations measure the infrared excess , which can be converted to a mass - loss rates assuming an expansion velocity for the circumstellar material .",
    "so far all of the mass - loss rates have been estimated using the assumptions that the expansion velocity is independent of the metallicity .",
    "the results presented here show that this assumption needs to be reconsidered .",
    "we have recently obtained spectra of some of the present sample with the infrared spectrograph on _ spitzer_. combining our co observations and these spectra together and comparing them to _ spitzer _ spectra from carbon stars in other galaxies in the local group will allow us to quantitatively study the mass - loss from carbon - rich agb stars in the local group and its dependence on metallicity",
