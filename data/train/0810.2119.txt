    "cosmological cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations have been very successful in describing the observed large - scale structures in the universe ( spergel et al .  2003 ; primack 2003 ) .",
    "they have , however , been less successful in describing the observed dark matter density profiles of galaxies at small radii . the most commonly used models",
    "( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , hereafter nfw ; see also moore et al .",
    "1998 ) predict that the dark matter density profile increases towards the center as a power law @xmath3 with @xmath4 to @xmath5 , giving rise to a `` cusp '' feature in the centers of galaxies .",
    "however , most observations do not confirm this nfw profile , instead preferring a sizeable central constant density - core with @xmath6 ( de blok et al .",
    "2001 ; de blok & bosma  2002 ) .",
    "the `` cusp / core '' problem is one aspect of the small - scale crisis in @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) cosmology ; the other two being the missing dwarf galaxies and the angular momentum problem ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .  1999 ; navarro et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "considerable research has been devoted to this problem , and the apparent inability of standard @xmath2cdm simulations to produce dark matter density profiles that match the observed profiles is now well - known ( flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ; de blok et al .  2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; weldrake et al .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "it has been argued that several observational systematic effects , such as beam smearing , pointing offsets , and non - circular motions , could affect the measured inner slope of the density profile , and may therefore `` hide '' the signatures of cusps in the central parts of galaxies ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 ; swaters et al .  2003 ; hayashi & navarro 2006 ) .",
    "the early rotation curves used to study the dark matter density profiles in low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies were mainly based on hi data with large beam - sizes , and beam - smearing could potentially have flattened the observed slopes of the rotation curves .",
    "however , high - resolution h@xmath7 rotation curves show consistency with the hi rotation curves ( de blok et al .  2001 ; mcgaugh et al .  2001 ;",
    "kuzio de narray et al .  2006 ) . from this",
    ", it seems that beam smearing effects are not significant enough to erase the signature of the cusp .    when using one - dimensional long - slit spectra , potential cusps may also be `` hidden '' by telescope pointing offsets ( i.e. , slit offsets ) with respect to the galaxy centers .",
    "however , de blok et al .  ( 2003 ) show that rotation curves observed by independent observers on different telescopes agree within the given errors and that pointing offsets are unlikely to exceed @xmath8 ( see also marchesini et al .",
    "2002 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; de blok 2004 ; gentile et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the insignificance of beam smearing and pointing offsets is also confirmed by high - resolution 2d optical velocity fields of lsb galaxies ( kuzio de narray et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one of the fundamental assumptions of most rotation curve studies is that the tracers that are typically used for galaxy dynamics , such as hi or h@xmath7 , travel on circular orbits",
    ". therefore , any significant non - circularity or random motions will affect the results derived by such studies .",
    "non - circular motions are not only thought to be due to star formation processes , but also due to bars , spiral density waves and non - circular halo potentials . for one dwarf lsb galaxy ( ddo 47 ) , gentile et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have quantified the non - circular motions and found them to be @xmath9 @xmath10 , i.e. , too small by about an order of magnitude to explain the @xmath2cdm discrepancy .",
    "an analysis of non - circular motions in 19 things galaxies ( trachternach et al .",
    "2008 ) also finds similar results : especially in the low - luminosity galaxies , non - circular motions are too small to explain the observed discrepancies .",
    "a different problem is that in order to isolate the dynamical contribution of the dark matter , the mass distribution of the baryons ( gas and stars ) needs to be determined first .",
    "for the neutral gas this can be directly derived from the integrated hi map , but for the stars this is less trivial .",
    "it requires knowledge of the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( hereafter @xmath11 ) which depends on several factors that are not well constrained , such as the amount of extinction from dust , the star formation history , and the stellar initial mass function .",
    "moreover , these factors are interdependent , making @xmath11  one of the parameters in galaxy mass modeling with the largest uncertainty .",
    "therefore , in many studies , minimum and maximum disk assumptions are often used ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ) : the minimum disk assumes that the observed rotation curve is entirely due to dark matter and thus gives a hard upper limit to the dark matter properties in galaxies .",
    "the maximum disk hypothesis maximizes the rotation contribution of the stellar disk and thus provides an upper limit on @xmath11  or , equivalently , a lower limit on the contribution of dark matter .",
    "however , these assumptions , though they provide useful limits , are not able to determine the exact amount of dark matter in galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the distribution of dark matter in two nearby dwarf galaxies , ic 2574 and ngc 2366 , using observations obtained as part of the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ; walter et al .",
    "dwarf galaxies are dark matter dominated and the highly resolved things observations provide an opportunity to trace in detail the overall dynamics and constrain the dark matter distribution .",
    "the distorted velocity contours in ic 2574 and ngc 2366 indicate the presence of non - circular motions ( see walter et al .",
    "2008 ; de blok et al .  2008 ; trachternach et al .",
    "a key element of our analysis is a new approach based on a gaussian fit algorithm to decompose the hi profiles .",
    "this method reduces and quantifies the effects of random non - circular motions or localized distortions due to , for example , hi shells and thus helps to extract the velocity component representing the underlying `` undisturbed '' kinematics . in this paper , we only focus on the small - scale non - circular motions due to , e.g. , star formation events and which are not related to large - scale features such as non - axisymmetric shapes of potentials etc .",

    "the adopted distances of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 are 4.0 kpc and 3.4 kpc , respectively ( walter et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we also constrain the mass of the stellar component of ic 2574 by using _ spitzer",
    "_ infrared array camera ( irac ) 3.6 @xmath1 m data from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; kennicutt et al .",
    "ngc 2366 is not part of the sings sample and for this galaxy we retrieved 3.6 @xmath1 m data from the _ spitzer _ archives .",

    "the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) is one of the largest h i survey programs undertaken with the nrao very large array ( vla ) and comprises observations of 34 nearby galaxies .",
    "it has high spatial ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) and spectral ( @xmath14 5.2 @xmath10 ) resolutions ( walter et al .",
    "in our analysis we use the natural - weighted cubes . in order to preserve the noise characteristics of the data , no residual scaling , primary beam correction or blanking was applied .",
    "the channel separation in the two galaxies discussed here , @xmath15 , is 2.6 @xmath10 . to constrain the contribution of the stellar component to the total kinematics we use 3.6 @xmath1 m data from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) for ic 2574 and from the _ spitzer _ archives for ngc 2366 . these can be used as a proxy for the distribution of the stellar population .",
    "the resolution of @xmath16 of the 3.6 @xmath1 m images is comparable to the things resolution .",
    "in addition , we use ancillary optical @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 images taken with the 2.1 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) as part of the sings survey . we show the data for ic 2574 and ngc 2366 in fig",
    "there are several ways to define a velocity field .",
    "these include first - moment maps , single gaussian , multiple gaussian , or hermite polynomial fits , as well as peak velocity fields ( see de blok et al.2008 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "some , such as first - moment maps , gaussian fits , and peak velocity fields , work well for single , symmetrical hi profiles , but fail to properly take into account the presence of multiple velocity components . in the upper - left panels of fig . 2 and 3 we show the intensity - weighted mean first - moment ( hereafter iwm ) velocity fields of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 ( the `` standard '' velocity fields ) .",
    "from the distorted contours in these velocity fields , it is clear that there are strong non - circular motions in both galaxies .",
    "it is also clear that the iwm velocity fields are not optimal for deriving a rotation curve and/or correcting for the non - circular motions .",
    "one can try and capture these non - circular motions by fitting multiple gaussian components to the profiles .",
    "however , even though it is possible to model a non - gaussian profile using multiple gaussian components , the standard method often implemented in astronomical software packages will frequently fail as it tries to fit these components simultaneously .",
    "this usually requires too many free parameters ( i.e. , amplitude , dispersion , and central position for each component used ) , quickly exceeding the typical number of data points in an hi profile .",
    "in addition , the presence of noise can result in the fit becoming sensitive to the values of the initial estimates .",
    "however , even if profiles are decomposed perfectly , we are still left with the fundamental problem that a decomposition into gaussian components does not give much insight as to which component is more representative of underlying circular rotation of the disk and which one represents non - circular motion or additional velocity components along the line of sight . in order to address this problem and extract the undisturbed `` bulk motion '' ( i.e. , the velocity most representative of the undisturbed rotation ) from the hi data cube of a given galaxy , we devised an alternative gaussian decomposition method .",
    "this method minimizes the effects of localized non - circular motions ( such as those caused by star formation processes ) and extracts the circularly rotating components from the hi data cube .",
    "the method consists of the following steps .      as an initial step ,",
    "an approximate rotation curve is derived from a major axis position - velocity diagram . for this",
    "we need to derive the position angle ( pa ) of the major axis , but also the center coordinates ( xpos , ypos ) , inclination ( incl ) and systemic velocity ( vsys ) .    initial estimates for xpos , ypos , pa , and incl can be derived from ellipse fits to isophotes in the hi surface density - map ( @xmath20 moment map ) , optical , or infrared images .",
    "this gives approximate but reasonable initial values . in this paper , we used ellipse fits to the 3.6 @xmath1 m images of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 at a level of 0.03 mjy sr@xmath21 to determine these initial values .",
    "we show the ellipse fits to the 3.6 @xmath1 m images for ic 2574 and ngc 2366 in the middle panels of fig .",
    "an estimate for vsys is determined by averaging the velocity values found near the center position . using the obtained geometric parameters",
    ", we perform single gaussian fits to the profiles found along the major axis in the hi data cube , and extract the rotation velocity ( vrot ) . if multiple peaks with different velocities exist at a given spatial position along the major axis , we select one of them as the initial estimate for the bulk motion , as determined by the average velocity at neighboring positions .",
    "we emphasize that at this stage we are only determining a first approximation to the rotation velocity and any errors introduced by an incorrect selection of a velocity component will be corrected in subsequent steps .",
    "we now create an artificial velocity field using the previously obtained geometrical parameters .",
    "as we are at this stage only interested in the overall shape of the rotation curve , we approximate the values of vrot obtained above with a fifth - order polynomial",
    ". the model velocity field will be used as initial estimates for extracting the bulk motions .",
    "the model fields for ic 2574 and ngc 2366 are shown in the top - right panels of figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "again , we stress that these model velocity fields are just first approximations .",
    "they are merely used to set the initial values for carrying out the multiple gaussian decomposition described in the following step .",
    "we now perform single gaussian fits to extract the typical velocities of all profiles in the data cube , taking into account the presence of possible secondary components . for this",
    ", we developed a program written in c. as is illustrated in the middle panel of fig .",
    "4 , if a profile consists of two gaussian components , the primary ( i.e. , strongest intensity ) gaussian component is extracted as shown , taking into account the effect of the secondary component on the fit . to do this",
    ", the program only uses data points that are least affected by the secondary component ( as shown by the filled circles in the middle panel of fig .",
    "4 ) .    we can judge the effect of the secondary component by making gaussian fits to both halves of the primary gaussian component separately ( as defined with respect to the position of the peak flux ) .",
    "the fit to the side containing the secondary component will result in a larger dispersion compared to the side with only a single component .",
    "this difference can be used to indicate the approximate location of the secondary component in a profile .      in the last step ,",
    "we assess whether the extracted velocities of the profiles in @xmath22 are acceptable as representative of the underlying circular rotation of the disk . for this",
    ", we compare those velocities with the model velocity fields derived in @xmath23 .",
    "if at some position the velocity difference ( @xmath24 ) is less than a prescribed limit ( here we use @xmath25 ) , we select the velocity derived in @xmath26 for the primary component as the velocity of the bulk motion at that position .    however , if the difference is larger , this suggests that a better velocity can be found by considering a secondary component , and we proceed as follows .",
    "the primary gaussian component of the profile in @xmath26 is subtracted from the original profile and subsequently a single gaussian fit is made to the residual profile , yielding a second gaussian component .",
    "this is illustrated in the right - most panel of fig .",
    "4 . when performing this second gaussian fit , the model velocity field created in @xmath27",
    "is used to determine an initial fit value .",
    "we compare the velocity derived for the secondary component with the model velocity field derived .",
    "likewise , we choose this velocity as the bulk velocity at this position , if the velocity difference @xmath24 is less than a certain limit ( where we again use @xmath25 ) . in cases where the velocity difference is larger , and no satisfactory primary or secondary component",
    "is found , we simply put a blank value in that position .",
    "we also note that the extracted fits that satisfy our @xmath28 criterion , are only defined as the `` bulk velocity '' component if they have a significant flux .",
    "we demand a peak flux @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the @xmath31 noise in the cube .",
    "we thus substitute a blank value into the bulk velocity field at positions where the extracted velocity shows strong deviations or where no significant emission can be found .",
    "this means that our method does not `` invent '' data where there are none . using these procedures",
    "we have now extracted the first approximate bulk velocity field from the hi data cube .",
    "we now repeat the entire process and go back to @xmath32 .",
    "however , rather than using the major axis estimates , we now fit a full `` tilted ring model '' ( begeman 1989 ) to the extracted bulk velocity field obtained in @xmath33 and derive a second approximation to the rotation curve parameters ( xpos , ypos , vsys , pa , incl , and vrot ) . using these newly determined tilted ring parameters , we construct a second , improved model velocity field for the bulk motion , which is less affected by additional components along the line of sight , and then proceed to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . in this way , we iterate the above procedures until the mean difference ( after one round of @xmath37 outlier rejection ) between successive velocity fields is less than @xmath25 .",
    "we have tested this method using different initial conditions ( model velocity fields ) and find that the result is independent of these conditions .",
    "empirically it was determined that three or four iterations lead to a stable result .",
    "the procedure is summarized in fig .",
    "the bulk velocity method works particularly well for galaxies in which non - circular motions form a significant part of the rotation velocity . for galaxies with high rotation velocities",
    ", the method produces results very similar to the hermite polynomial method for constructing velocity fields described in de blok et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we applied this method to ic 2574 and ngc 2366 .",
    "the final extracted bulk velocity fields are shown in the bottom - left panels of figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "most disturbances seen in the iwm velocity fields of both galaxies are removed , especially in the central regions of ic 2574 and the north - western part of ngc 2366 . in general",
    "a warp significantly changes the position angle of the kinematical major axis as a function of radius and is found in the outer parts of a galaxy ( bosma 1978 ) .",
    "no significant changes of the derived position angles , as will be shown in section 3.3 , of the tilted ring models of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 are shown in regions where most disturbances are seen",
    ". therefore , these disturbances are not likely to be from a warp . as a bonus",
    ", we also obtain the velocity fields of the strong non - circular motions , which are shown in the bottom - right panels of figs . 2 and 3 . these contain the velocities of the primary components at the positions where these primary components were found to track the non - circular motions , i.e.",
    ", this is not a residual velocity field . in order to visualize",
    "how well the extracted bulk velocity field traces the rotation of the gas , we use azimuthal position - velocity diagrams measured along ellipses defined using the tilted ring models . in a quiescent galaxy with only circular motions , one expects the observed velocities to follow a cosine as a function of azimuth . any regions containing",
    "non - circular motions deviate from the cosine curves and we can therefore use the position - velocity diagrams to assess whether the bulk - motion extraction method is able to properly decompose the multiple profiles and identify the bulk motion component properly ( see stil & israel 2002 for an analysis which uses these azimuthal position - velocity diagrams to quantify non - circular motions ) .    in figs . 6 and 7",
    ", we show the azimuthal position - velocity diagrams of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 , respectively . in fig . 6 , strong non - circular motions in ic 2574",
    "are easily identified at @xmath38 at most radii .",
    "for example , in the region at @xmath39 and @xmath38 , two clearly separated profiles are visible .",
    "this is where the iwm velocities are strongly affected by non - circular motions .",
    "these non - circular motions are caused by the effects of the supergiant shell in ic 2574 ( discussed in walter et al .",
    "in contrast , the bulk velocities extracted by our method follow a sinusoidal line tracing the underlying bulk motion of ic 2574 . similarly , for ngc 2366 in fig .",
    "7 we can see the presence of strong non - circular motions at @xmath40 at most radii .",
    "the iwm velocities , affected by non - circular motions , display a non - symmetric shape in the position - velocity diagram in regions with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the extracted bulk velocities again have a sinusoidal - shape , indicating that the bulk velocity field for ngc 2366 indeed traces the underlying rotation .",
    "we derived the rotation curves of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 using the bulk velocity fields obtained in section 3.2 . in order to quantify the difference with the iwm velocity field",
    ", we also derive the rotation curves from the latter velocity fields .",
    "we used the gipsy task rotcur to make tilted ring fits to the bulk and iwm velocity fields .",
    "the initial estimates of the ring parameters , such as xpos , ypos , pa , and incl were determined by an ellipse fit to the irac 3.6 @xmath1 m images for ic 2574 and ngc 2366 ( except vsys which was derived from the hi global profile ) .",
    "after fixing the position of the dynamical center ( xpos , ypos ) and vsys , we run rotcur with pa and incl as free parameters .",
    "we made low - order polynomial fits ( usually of fifth order ) to the pa and incl distributions to describe the large - scale variations with radius .",
    "we fixed pa and incl to these fit values and ran rotcur again with xpos , ypos , and vsys as free parameters . from this , we radially average the xpos , ypos , and vsys and obtain more fine - tuned mean values . these values were fixed again and rotcur was run once more leaving the pa and incl free .",
    "we iterated the rotcur task in this way until all ring parameters converged .",
    "for the last step , we fixed all ring parameters except vrot and derived the final rotation curves of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 .",
    "the derived rotation curves are shown in figs . 8 and 9 and",
    "the tilted ring parameters are summarized in table 1 .    in the case of ic 2574",
    "we found that the maximum difference between rotation velocities as derived from the iwm and bulk velocity fields is about @xmath1214 @xmath10 at a radius of around 7 kpc , as shown in fig .",
    "10 and fig .",
    "11 and this is a significant difference .",
    "note also the decreased scatter in the tilted ring parameters , compared to the iwm tilted ring model presented in fig .",
    "10 . this can be considered as circumstantial evidence that the bulk velocity field is less affected by non - circular motions and therefore traces the underlying rotation of ic 2574 more accurately than the iwm velocity field .",
    "we note the large difference between the bulk velocity field rotation curve and the rotation curve derived by martimbeau et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in an earlier study ( fig .",
    "martimbeau et al .",
    "( 1994 ) used an iwm velocity field and adopted a large value for the inclination ( @xmath12@xmath43 ) , both of which are responsible for this difference .",
    "we compare the rotation curve of ngc 2366 derived from the bulk velocity field with the one derived from the iwm velocity field in fig .",
    "the derived geometrical tilted ring parameters from both bulk and iwm velocity fields are consistent with each other , except for small differences in the position angle .",
    "we do find a significant velocity difference in the outer parts .",
    "larger non - circular motions thus exist in the outer parts of ngc 2366 confirming the impression given by the bottom - right panel of fig.3 .",
    "13 compares our bulk rotation curve of ngc 2366 with previous determinations by hunter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and swaters ( 1999 ) .",
    "the latter curve agrees with the current data out to 5.5 kpc .",
    "the hunter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) curve is systematically lower than our bulk curve .",
    "a partial explanation is that they used a higher inclination of @xmath44 , but this difference is not large enough to explain the entire discrepancy . though hunter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) do not explicitly state how their velocity field was constructed , it is likely that they used an iwm map , rather than one based on profile fits .",
    "declining rotation curves at the outer parts of a galaxy have been often considered as an indication that the end of the dark matter distribution is reached ( carignan & puche 1990 ; casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; ryder et al .",

    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "13 , the possibility that a declining rotation curve at the outer parts of a galaxy is simply mimicked by non - circular motions can not be ruled out .",
    "the comparisons between iwm and bulk velocity results given above have to some degree been qualitative . to really quantify the presence of non - circular motions in both types of velocity fields and gauge the effectiveness of the bulk velocity method in removing these effects",
    ", we show here harmonic decompositions of the iwm and bulk velocity fields of ic 2574 .",
    "we refer to trachternach et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for an extensive discussion of the method . in summary",
    ", we used the gipsy task reswri to decompose the velocity fields into sine and cosine terms and only kept the center position fixed during the harmonic expansion .",
    "we only included terms up to third order .",

    "the total amplitudes of the non - circular motions are of most interest .",
    "the median absolute amplitudes @xmath50 of each component were calculated by taking the median of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( @xmath47 is the rotation velocity ) . as can be seen in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "14 , the radially averaged , median amplitudes for the @xmath56 , and @xmath57 components are small for both velocity fields .",
    "for the second order ( @xmath58 ) , however , the harmonic decomposition of the bulk velocity field results in a much smaller amplitude than that of the iwm velocity field .",
    "the effect of the bulk velocity method can be seen even more clearly in the top - center panel of fig .",
    ", we plot the absolute amplitude of the non - circular motions using the following equation : @xmath59 the harmonic components found in the iwm velocity field show large amplitudes between @xmath60 , whereas the results from the bulk velocity field are consistent with regular circular rotation .",
    "the rotation curves obtained from the bulk velocity field reflect the total ( baryonic + dark matter ) kinematics of galaxies and in order to say anything about the dark matter , we thus need to quantify the contribution by the baryons .    to derive the contribution of the gas component to the total kinematics the radial hi surface density distribution is required .",
    "this is obtained from the integrated hi map ( natural - weighted ) ( walter et al .",
    "2008 ) using the derived tilted ring model parameters .",
    "the h i radial surface density is then used to derive the corresponding contribution to the rotation velocity after correcting the surface density for the presence of helium and metals ( i.e. , after scaling by a factor of 1.4 ; de blok et al .",

    "these results show that the nfw distribution is not an appropriate fitting function for our galaxies and that the implied dark matter distributions of the two dwarf galaxies , ic 2574 and ngc 2366 , instead show a sizeable central constant - density core , which can be well approximated by the pseudo - isothermal halo model .",
    "we now compare the hi rotation curves and mass modeling based on the bulk velocity fields with a similar analysis done using the iwm velocity fields to examine the effect of non - circular motions on the dynamics of galaxies .",

    "we use @xmath141 to describe the rotation curve derived assuming the geometrical parameters from the bulk velocity field tilted ring model but applied to the iwm velocity field .",
    "finally , we use @xmath142 to describe the rotation curve derived using a tilted ring model as derived from and applied to the iwm velocity field .    for a galaxy affected by non - circular motions",
    ", the traditional iwm velocity field will be distorted . in general , non - circular motions as present in galaxies ,",
    "are likely to make the observed rotation velocity fall below the circular velocity ( rhee et al .",
    "this is indeed happening in our galaxies as indicated in fig .",
    "23 , where @xmath142 is significantly lower than @xmath140 .",
    "the velocity difference between @xmath140 and @xmath141 can only be attributed to differences in the bulk and iwm velocity fields , as we use otherwise identical geometrical parameters .    in the case of ic 2574 ,",
    "a distinct velocity difference is seen in the central region where the iwm velocity field is distorted by non - circular motions ( fig .",
    "23 , left column ) .",
    "such a velocity difference is also found in ngc 2366 , particularly in the outer parts ( see the fig . 23 , right column ) .    in practice , this underestimate of the rotation velocity results in a decreased dynamical contribution of the dark matter to the total dynamics , as the contribution of stellar and gas components are fixed for any given @xmath11 assumption .",
    "consequently , non - circular motions decrease the role of dark matter with respect to the visible matter . in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "23 the rotation velocity due to the stellar component using the model @xmath85  values for ic 2574 already exceeds @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the inner parts even without the dynamical contribution of the gas component .",
    "the @xmath140 rotation curve , however , can in the inner parts not only accommodate the rotation of the stellar component , but also that of the gas component .",
    "an intuitive way to illustrate the dark matter distribution of a galaxy is to calculate the mass density that corresponds to the observed rotation velocity .",
    "the observed rotation velocity is converted to mass density by assuming a spherical mass distribution ( i.e. , @xmath143 = @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) . for the inversion , we use the following formula ( de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath146 where @xmath18 is the rotation velocity observed at radius @xmath19 .",
    "this direct conversion is only valid under the assumption that the observed rotation velocity is entirely due to the dark matter component , as is the case with a minimum disk ( i.e. , maximum halo ) . in general",
    "the minimum disk assumption is a good description for dwarf galaxies and lsb galaxies ( de blok et al .",
    "2002 ) , and we therefore also apply this assumption to ic 2574 and ngc 2366 . while one could , in principle , make an explicit correction for the rotational contribution of the baryons , for the crucial innermost parts this involves using the difference between two small numbers , which can lead to wildly fluctuating values of the derivative in eq . 20 .",
    "the minimum disk assumption thus yields a safe and robust upper limit on the dark matter properties and in particular to the steepness of the inner slope ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we follow the method described in de blok et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to determine the slope of the inner component of the mass density profile .",
    "we measure the slopes of the inner parts ( @xmath147 kpc ) of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 using a least squares fit and find the values of the slopes to be @xmath148 for ic 2574 and @xmath149 for ngc 2366 , respectively .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "24 and are in good agreement with the earlier result of @xmath150 ( de blok et al .",
    "2001 , de blok & bosma 2002 ) for a larger sample of lsb galaxies .",
    "these flat slopes thus imply that the dark matter distributions of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 are well characterized by a sizeable constant - density core .",
    "the mass density profiles for the best - fit minimum disk nfw and pseudo - isothermal models are also over - plotted in fig .",
    "the pseudo - isothermal halo follows the observed mass density profile most closely .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the steep slope predicted by the nfw profile .",
    "we plot the value of the inner - slope @xmath7 of the mass - density profile against the observed radius of the innermost point @xmath151 in fig .",
    "the result is consistent with the earlier results by de blok et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the observed dark matter distributions of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 are both best described by the pseudo - isothermal halo model with a constant - density core .",
    "we have presented mass models for the nearby dwarf galaxies , ic 2574 and ngc 2366 , derived using the high - resolution data from things .",
    "these high - resolution data do not suffer from beam smearing , have a well - defined dynamical center and enable us to examine in detail the dark matter distribution of these galaxies . to minimize the effects of random non - circular motions on the derived kinematics of a galaxy , we developed a new gaussian decomposition method and used this to construct a `` bulk '' velocity field of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 , showing the underlying undisturbed rotation .",
    "the random , non - circular motions of ic 2574 and ngc 2366 , visible as distortions in the velocity contours of the traditional iwm velocity fields , were largely removed in the newly constructed bulk velocity fields . comparing the hi rotation curves derived from the bulk and iwm velocity fields , we find that the rotation velocities derived from the iwm velocity fields are significantly lower than those from the bulk velocity fields . in addition , non - circular motions of ngc 2366 are likely to be responsible for the declining rotation velocities derived from the iwm velocity fields in the outer parts .",
    "combining optical and sings 3.6 @xmath1 m data , we quantify the dynamical contribution of the stellar component to the total kinematics . for this",
    "we compute @xmath11  values based on the bruzual and charlot ( 2003 ) population synthesis models for the 3.6 @xmath1 m and 4.5 @xmath1 m bands .",
    "we have fitted nfw and pseudo - isothermal dark matter halos to the derived rotation curves , taking into account the contributions due to stars and gas .",
    "we found that the pseudo - isothermal halo provides a better fit to the observations than the nfw halo .",
    "we use the derived mass density profile to determine the value of the inner slope .",
    "the measured slopes are @xmath148 for ic 2574 and @xmath149 for ngc 2366 , compared to the nfw model which predicts @xmath152 .",
