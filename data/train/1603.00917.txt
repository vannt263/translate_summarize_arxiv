    "ionic microgel and nanogel particles formed by cross - linked polyelectrolyte networks displays many remarkable properties which make them suitable for applications in drug - delivery systems , where molecules can be encapsulated and then released at specific targets  @xcite .",
    "this is possible through a swelling ( or de - swelling ) process , where solvent molecules flow into ( or leave ) the cross - linked network .",
    "experimentally  @xcite it is well - known that the properties of ionic microgels and nanogels particles can be significantly affected by the changes in temperature , solvent quality , salt concentration , ionic strength , and degree of cross - linking .",
    "although these effects have been extensively studied in ionic macrogels  @xcite , little is known about ionic nanogels formed by finite - size cross - linked polyelectrolyte networks  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the swelling processes in polyelectrolyte networks have been studied  @xcite using flory s theory  @xcite , which combines the mixing term , electrostatic , and elastic contributions into the total free energy of the system .",
    "an important aspect of the theory is the relationship between the ( effective ) number of chains of the network @xmath3 and the elastic free energy  @xcite , _ i.e. _  @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , the unambiguous interpretation of this relationship in terms of the network topology and its validation is relevant to the development of predictive theories , _ e.g. _  @xcite . in principle",
    ", such relationship can be verified by computer simulations considering explicit network structures , but to our knowledge current studies have so far only exploited polyelectrolyte networks with diamond - like structures ( _ i.e. _  with tetrafunctional cross - links )  @xcite .    here",
    "we explore this issue by considering three types of nanogel particles generated by polyelectrolyte networks of different topologies characterized by the functionality ( also known as coordination number or connectivity ) @xmath2 of the cross - links .",
    "in particular , we will investigate how the equilibrium properties of the nanosized gel particles are affected by the fraction @xmath1 of the ionizable groups and salt concentration @xmath0 in solution .",
    "these important effects have also been explored by experiments@xcite and theory  @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ systemdef : zcoord](a ) , the nanogel particle is modeled as a polyelectrolyte network with @xmath5 monomers inside a spherical wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell of volume @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number density of nanogel particles in solution . the radius of the ws cell is then @xmath8 .",
    "some monomers of the network are ionizable ( anionic ) and will dissociate releasing a counterion into solution . the fraction of dissociation @xmath1 determines the number of negatively charged monomers @xmath9 in the network , and charge neutrality requires @xmath10 counterions in solution .",
    "the counterions are allowed to diffuse everywhere inside the ws cell . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that all the ions are spherical while the solvent , water , is modeled as a dielectric continuum .    in order to investigate the effect of topology on the swelling of the nanogel particle , we study three different networks that are arbitrarly generated from a regular structures determined by the functionality @xmath2 of the cross - links .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ systemdef : zcoord](b)-(d ) , the networks are built considering cross - links with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , that are connected to each other through chains with @xmath14 monomers .",
    "the final networks are obtained by cropping the large regular template structures ( with the number of monomers larger than @xmath5 ) , so that only the @xmath5 monomers inside a spherical volume comprise the nanogel particle .",
    "importantly , we have selected such spherical volume in a way that all the different networks are formed by approximately the same number of monomers @xmath5 , which leads to different number of cross - links @xmath15 with functionality @xmath2 , as shown in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "note that this procedure leads to networks with higher effective cross - link line density @xmath16 as @xmath2 is lowered . also , the cropping procedure inevitably results in @xmath17 dangling chains ( which could have less than @xmath14 monomers ) near the surface of the polyelectrolyte network , as illustrated in fig .",

    "next we present results for a salt - free solution , _ i.e. _  when @xmath46 and the only dissociated ions in the system are those from the polyelectrolyte network .",

    "( a ) relative nanogel radius @xmath58 ( inset : swelling ratio @xmath59 ) ; and ( b ) effective nanogel charge @xmath60 ( inset : relative number of positive charges inside a nanogel particle @xmath61 ) . ]",
    "first , we investigate the effects of dissociation fraction @xmath1 on the size of a nanogel particle , which is defined in terms of the radius of gyration @xmath62 , where the average @xmath63 is over all @xmath64 pairs in the polylectrolyte network  @xcite .",
    "for instance , when the dissociation fraction is zero , the radius of gyration gives @xmath65    for @xmath11 , @xmath66     for @xmath67 , and @xmath68     for @xmath69 .",
    "we note that these values yields similar results for the volume cross - link densities , @xmath70 with @xmath71 , for all networks considered , which contrasts with the line densities @xmath72 presented in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "figure  [ radius_and_zeff](a ) shows that the relative nanogel radius @xmath73 increases as the dissociation fraction @xmath1 increases , which is in agreement with what is theoretically predicted in refs .",
    "the increasing behavior of @xmath19 is similar for the different networks , but one can observe that it gets more pronounced for those with low connectivity . another useful measurement to quantify this effect is the swelling ratio  @xcite , which can be defined as @xmath74 ) , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the volume of the nanogel in two solvency conditions ( _ e.g. _  the swelled and de - swelled states , respectively ) .",
    "hence for a given dissociation fraction @xmath1 the swelling ratio can be simply written as @xmath77 , with @xmath78 being the nanogel radius for @xmath79 . as is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ radius_and_zeff](b ) , the highest swelling ratios @xmath59 are achieved by the networks formed by cross - links of low connectivity ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the dissociated counterions can diffuse around the polyelectrolyte network , so that the nanogel particles acquire an effective net charge  @xcite , which is smaller than the bare charge @xmath10 of the polyelectrolyte backbone .",
    "the effective charge is given by , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the number of positive and negative ions inside the nanogel volume , respectively .",
    "here we take @xmath83 because there are no negative ions in the solution when salt concentration is zero ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "figure  [ radius_and_zeff](b ) shows that @xmath60 increases with the dissociation fraction @xmath1 , which is consistent with the theoretical predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite . for larger values of @xmath1 the network with functionality @xmath11 presents slightly lower values of @xmath60 in comparison to the other networks .",
    "this occurs mainly because the network with functionality @xmath11 allows for more counterions to become trapped between the polyelectrolytes chains , as shown by the relative number of positive charges inside a nanogel @xmath61 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ radius_and_zeff](b ) ) .",
    "these results corroborate the equilibrium behaviour observed in previous simulations  @xcite . however , in contrast to the previous theoretical studies  @xcite that predicted a scaling @xmath84 , our results suggest a more linear behavior , which might be related to the relatively small size of the polyelectrolyte networks considered in our simulations .     on the size of nanogel particles formed by networks with cross - links of functionality @xmath2 for different values of the dissociation fraction @xmath1 .",
    "( a ) @xmath11 , ( b ) @xmath67 , and ( c ) @xmath69 . ]    to better characterize this picture we evaluate the monomer @xmath85 and the ionic @xmath86 density profiles . figure  [ density_profiles ] shows @xmath85 and @xmath87 for three different networks at different values of dissociation fraction @xmath1 .",
    "as can be seen in the upper panels , the heterogeneity due to the specific topology of the networks is reflected in monomer density profiles and becomes evident as the dissociation fraction @xmath1 increases and the nanogel swells .",
    "such heterogeneities in density profiles have been observed in simulations and were related both to solvent quality conditions  @xcite and to monomer - ion steric repulsion  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been speculated that the void created at the center of the nanogel particle might have potential to act as a drug carrier  @xcite , but our results suggest that the density profiles are inherent to the structure of the network considered , corroborating recent experimental evidences  @xcite . for instance , the monomer density profile in fig .  [",
    "density_profiles](c ) of the swelled network for @xmath88 displays a peak when @xmath89 approaches the center of the nanogel ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this happens because a cross - link with functionality @xmath69 is placed ( by construction ) in the center of that network , which differs from the network with @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ density_profiles](b ) , where no cross - link is placed at the center of the initially generated network . despite these heterogeneities in @xmath85 , the ionic density profiles for the three networks present similar behaviors , _",
    "i.e. _  showing higher values of @xmath87 ( both inside and outside the nanogel particle ) as the fraction @xmath1 increases .",
    "now we turn our attention to the effect of 1:1 salt on the swelling properties of nanogel particles . in this case , additionally to the @xmath10 positively charged ions due to dissociation of the ionizable groups of the polyelectrolyte network , the dissociation of salt at a given concentration @xmath91 leads to @xmath92 coions ( anions ) and @xmath92 counterions ( cations ) in solution . for simplicity ,",
    "such additional ions are considered to be hard spheres which interact with all charged particles in the system via coulomb ( eq .  [ coulombpot ] ) and hard core potentials .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ salteffect ] , the effect of the presence of salt on the de - swelling behavior of the network is weaker for the networks with high connectivity .",
    "particularly , for the network with @xmath11 , one can see that while the nanogel radius @xmath19 remains constant for low values of the dissociation fraction , it displays a decreasing behavior for @xmath88 , which is in agreement with the behavior predicted by the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , and also observed in experiments  @xciteand in a previous simulation study  @xcite .",
    "we note that even though excluded volume effects are taken into account in our model , we are not able to observe a reentrant ( or re - swelling ) behavior expected for high salt concentrations  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we presented an analysis of the swelling behavior of ionic nanogels defined by explicit polyelectrolyte networks formed by cross - links of different topologies .",
    "our results indicate that despite the higher effective cross - link line density @xmath72 , the polyelectrolyte network formed by cross - links with low connectivity ( @xmath11 ) display the highest volume changes both in the presence and in the absence of monovalent salt in the system . in particular , we have verified that both nanogel size @xmath19 and its effective net charge @xmath60 increase as the fraction @xmath1 of ionizable groups in the network increases .",
    "also , there is a clear de - swelling behavior for a increasing concentration of salt in solution for the networks with functionality @xmath11 at high values of @xmath1 .",
    "we found that these effects are dramatically reduced for the networks with functionality @xmath69 , indicating that a higher elastic energy contribution is hampering the change in the size of the nanogel particle , which is confirmed in the appendix section .  by considering that the effective number of chains in the network @xmath3 is proportional to the functionality @xmath2 of its cross - links , our results corroborates flory s assumption that @xmath4 , although in his theory the elastic free energy has a purely entropic origin  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our results are in a qualitative agreement with the swelling behavior theoretically predicted in ref .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the theory may be hampered by the assumptions of implicit chain ( modeled by an elastic energy contribution ) and a flat monomer density inside the nanogel volume , as these approximations might not be appropriate for small - sized nanogel particles studied in the present simulations .",
