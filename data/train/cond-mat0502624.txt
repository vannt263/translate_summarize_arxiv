    "because block copolymers readily self - assemble into various ordered arrays , they have been avidly studied for technological applications such as high density porous materials , nano - lithographic templates , photonic band gap materials @xcite , and well - ordered arrays of metal nano - wires @xcite .",
    "one practical difficulty to their use in some applications is that the ordered phase is not created in one single crystal , but rather in domains of differing orientation .",
    "one means of aligning the domains is to apply an external electric field .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that applying an electric potential , on the order of a few to a few dozen volts across electrodes separated by several micrometers , can effectively orient domains of lamellar or cylindrical morphology normal to the surfaces of thin films .",
    "the basis of this orientation effect is simple . in order to reduce accumulation of polarization charge ,",
    "the system lowers its free energy by aligning cylinders or lamellae so that their long axis is parallel to the applied field .",
    "recently , related experiments on diblock copolymers @xcite have been performed where external fields have been applied to bring about a phase transition from a phase of spheres to one of cylinders . in the phase of spheres ,",
    "it is not possible to eliminate the accumulation of polarization charge so that its free energy increases in an external field with respect to a cylindrical phase , and a phase transition can be induced .",
    "this change in phase due to the application of an electric field was considered by tsori et al .",
    "@xcite , and by xu et al @xcite .",
    "the effects of an external field on an ordered array of inhomogeneous dielectric material is of great interest .",
    "first , the problem is inherently self - consistent simply because the material is a dielectric ; _ i.e. _ the electric field at a given point depends upon the polarization at that point which , in turn , depends upon the local electric field .",
    "in addition , in the problem of interest here , the local dielectric constant is inhomogeneous .",
    "it depends upon the morphology of the ordered phase , which itself depends upon the local electric field @xcite .    in previous calculations for diblock copolymers",
    "@xcite , this self - consistent circle has been broken by assuming that the two block are only weakly segregated , resulting in a small amplitude of the spatial variation of the relative concentration of the two blocks . in this case",
    "it follows from the vanishing of the divergence of the electric displacement that the amplitude of the spatially varying electric field is also small so that the electrostatic maxwell equation can be solved perturbatively for the electric field as a function of the order parameter .",
    "this procedure was carried out to quadratic order in the field by amundson et al.@xcite .",
    "it is appropriate in the weak - segregation limit , and should be adequate for determining the general phase behavior in weak external fields .",
    "however , since experiments are often not in the weak segregation limit , and the effect of electric fields has hardly been explored , further study is clearly called for .    in recent years",
    ", thermodynamic properties of block copolymer systems have been treated successfully by the _ full _ self - consistent field ( scf ) theory , to which weak- and strong - segregation theories are approximations @xcite .",
    "given the self - consistent nature of an inhomogeneous dielectric in an external electric field , it seems natural to apply the full scf theory to this problem as well .",
    "that is what we do in this paper .",
    "we solve exactly the full set of scf equations _ and _ the appropriate maxwell equations under the assumption of a simple constitutive relation between the local dielectric properties and the local volume fractions .",
    "in particular , we consider the evolution of the bulk phase diagram of diblock copolymers in an applied electric field , and focus upon its effect on reducing the region of the phase diagram occupied by the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure , ( space group @xmath2 ) .",
    "evolution of the gyroid structure ( space group @xmath3 ) , whose region in the phase diagram also decreases due to the application of a field , is not considered .",
    "we calculate the strength of an external field needed to bring about a phase transition from the ( distorted ) spherical phase to the disordered phase and to the cylindrical phase . for the transition to the latter phase we find two distinct behaviors depending upon the architecture of the diblock , as measured by the parameter @xmath4 introduced below .",
    "the first is brought about if a transition from the spherical phase to the cylindrical phase can be induced in the absence of an external electric field simply by reducing the temperature in the realm of interest .",
    "if so , the same must also be true for very small fields . as a consequence",
    ", one can always find a temperature in that realm at which an arbitrarily small field will induce a transition from the spherical to the cylindrical phase .",
    "the other behavior occurs if the spherical phase is the most stable one in the absence of an external field for temperatures in the realm of interest . in that case , a _",
    "non - zero _ external field is required to induce a transition from it to the cylindrical one at any temperature in this realm . in either case",
    ", we find that for a given architecture , there is a maximum value of applied field beyond which the spherical phase is no longer the most stable one for any temperature .    in the following section",
    ", we set up the general formalism . in section iii , we discuss its application to the phase of ( distorted ) spheres , and compare the results of the full self - consistent calculation with those obtained from an expansion of the free energy in the electric field to order @xmath5 .",
    "such an expansion does not indicate the optimal direction in which the field aligns the cubic phase , whereas the full calculation shows that alignment along the ( 111 ) direction is favored over a ( 100 ) orientation .",
    "there is a concomitant reduction of the symmetry of the phase from @xmath6 ( bcc phase ) to @xmath7 ( distorted spherical phase ) .",
    "various cuts through the phase diagram are also presented .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and comparison with recent experiments .",

    "[ fig : fofphases ] and eqs .",
    "( [ thermo])-([thermo1 ] ) .",
    "the second concerns the fact that the dielectric constants are temperature dependent .",

    "[ fig : r3m_constf ] and [ fig : phasediagram0.1 ] , show that the value of the electric field needed to bring about a transition from the @xmath0 phase is , for a given @xmath4 fraction , a sensitive function of temperature and , for a given temperature , a sensitive function of the mole fraction of @xmath17 block , @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : r3m_conste ] shows two cuts through the phase diagram at constant electric field , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 . the solid line at lower @xmath62 shows the phase boundary at zero - field between disordered and bcc phases while the solid line at larger @xmath62 shows the zero - field phase boundary , between the bcc and hexagonal phases .",
    "the dashed lines between them show the phase boundaries for @xmath183 .",
    "the line denoted @xmath18 is the boundary between the disordered and the @xmath0 phase of distorted spheres , @xmath17 is the boundary between @xmath0 and hexagonal phases .",
    "these boundaries meet at the triple point , @xmath184 , which occurs at @xmath185 , and @xmath186 for larger values of @xmath4 , there is a line , @xmath187 , of transitions directly from the disordered to the hexagonal phase . as the external field increases still",
    "further , the triple point recedes to larger values of @xmath62 leaving behind only the line of direct transitions between disordered and hexagonal phases .",
    "note that , except for the location of its terminus at the triple point , this boundary is independent of the applied field as it contributes to the free energy of both of these phases equally .",
    "the dielectric constants used to generate this figure are the same as those used in previous figures .    for completeness , we have also examined the case in which the dielectric constants of the minority and majority components are interchanged as compared with fig .  [",
    "fig : r3m_constf ] .",
    "namely , the majority component with , @xmath188 has the larger dielectric constant of @xmath124 and the minority the smaller value of @xmath125 .",
    "we find that the @xmath158 phase is now somewhat more stable with respect to the hexagonal phase , so that the value of the external electric field needed to bring about a transition from the former to the latter phase is increased .",
    "we note that this interchange increases the average value of the dielectric constant , so that all phases have a lower free energy due to the factor of @xmath189 which it contains .",
    "however , it is not _ a priori _ obvious that the @xmath0 phase would have its free energy lowered by more than that of the hexagonal phase by this interchange .",
    "in addition , we have determined that the spheres of minority component and lower dielectric constant distort in the [ 111 ] direction just as in the case when the minority component has the larger dielectric constant .",
    "the above effects are not captured by the perturbation result of eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) which is invariant under the interchange of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in sum , we have calculated the phase diagram of a block copolymer system in an external electric field which couples to the diblocks through the difference in their dielectric constants .",
    "we have employed a fully self - consistent field approach in which the relevant maxwell equation is treated on an equal footing with the other self - consistent equations .",
    "we have determined that the body - centered cubic phase will preferentially align along the [ 111 ] direction causing its symmetry to be reduced to @xmath136 .",
    "the electric field can induce phase transitions between this phase and either the disordered or the hexagonal phase .",
    "the strength of the field needed to induce such transitions is a sensitive function of the parameters of the system , such as its temperature and its chain architecture , which in the case of linear diblocks is quantified simply by the mole fraction , @xmath4 .    for parameters that fit the experimental pmma - ps diblock copolymer system investigated recently @xcite : @xmath172 , @xmath175nm@xmath54 , and @xmath163k , we find that an electric field of at least @xmath190 v/@xmath56 m would be needed to observe a transition to the hexagonal phase .",
    "this contrasts with the reported existence of such a phase transition under an applied field of only 40v/@xmath56 m .",
    "there are several possible explanations of the difference between the experimental results and the theoretical ones presented here .",
    "our model employs a linear constitutive relation between dielectric constant and volume fractions , and characterizes the pmma - ps system by a few general parameters , the pmma mole fraction @xmath4 , and the interaction parameter @xmath62 .",
    "it further assumes equal volumes for both monomers and equal kuhn lengths for them .",
    "one knows that deviations from the last assumption certainly shift the locations of the phase boundaries @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that at rather asymmetric volume fractions of @xmath172 , the model provides only semi - quantitative agreement with the experimental pmma - ps phase diagram .",
    "any difference in the theoretical and experimental phase diagrams at zero electric field will , in the presence of a non - zero one , manifest itself in a difference in relative stability of the various phases .",
    "given the sensitive dependence on the phase boundaries of the minimum external field needed to bring about a phase transition , differences between the general theory and the experimental result are to be expected .",
    "at present , the phase diagram of the pmma - ps system of ref .",
    "@xcite is not yet known .",
    "when additional experimental information becomes available , one will also need to determine the relationship between the temperature and the @xmath191 interaction parameter in order to convert the phase diagram calculated here to practical units so that it can be compared directly to the experimental one .",
    "lastly , we have employed a simple coupling between the system and the external field via the difference in dielectric constants of the copolymer blocks .",
    "other couplings are possible @xcite .",
    "just such an additional coupling , to mobile ions , has been suggested by tsori et al .",
    "@xcite and is discussed also in ref .",
    "a minute fraction of mobile ions embedded in the minority pmma fraction and not in the majority ps can lead to an enhanced response of the pmma - ps system to external electric fields with moderate magnitude .",
    "it could also change the phase diagram quantitatively resulting in a substantial lowering of the triple - point value of the electric field .",
    "additional experiments , particularly on copolymers with the same pmma - ps blocks , but at different temperatures or values of the architectural parameter @xmath4 , would be most useful to shed additional light on the comparison of theory and experiment . in particular ,",
    "a comparison of the two pmma - ps systems of ref .  @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite would be enlightening because , as figs .",
    "[ fig : r3m_constf ] and  [ fig : phasediagram0.1 ] show , they are predicted here to exhibit significantly different phase behavior in an external electric field .",
