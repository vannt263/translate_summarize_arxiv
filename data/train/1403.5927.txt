    "the dynamics given by the above generator then means that infected individuals heal at rate 1 and transmit the infection at rate @xmath0 to each neighbour . in this introduction",

    "an important and interesting question about the contact process is as follows .",

    "of course , since the contact process dies out on any finite graph for any value of @xmath0 , the different regimes corresponding to different values of @xmath0 can not be defined for @xmath47 the same way they are defined for @xmath46 . with this in mind , one considers the extinction time @xmath49 and tries to determine if , asymptotically as @xmath7 , the law of @xmath49 has different aspects depending on the value of @xmath0 .    for the case in which @xmath37 and @xmath48 is a box of @xmath50 with side length @xmath3 , this has been thoroughly studied .",
    "put briefly , it is known that if @xmath51 , then @xmath49 grows logarithmically with the volume of @xmath48 , whereas if @xmath52 , then @xmath49 grows exponentially with the volume of @xmath48 .",
