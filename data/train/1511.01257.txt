    "entanglement , a particularly striking feature of quantum mechanics is thought of as the key ingredients in the fields of quantum information science @xcite . the theoretical study of the entanglement evolution in open quantum systems has attracted considerable interest @xcite . recently , much attention has been paid to the case when the non - markovian effect is non - ignorable @xcite .",
    "the dynamical back action of the memory environments has been experimentally observed @xcite , which provides a reliable way to preserve entangled states @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism of this remarkable phenomenon is understood as the interplay between the existence of the bound state and the non - markovian effect @xcite .",

    "entanglement in such nanostructures has been studied extensively , ranging from spin entanglement @xcite , entangling an excitonic two - level system @xcite and tripartite entanglement @xcite , to entanglement detection or measurement @xcite . in practice , however , as the quantum system always interacts with its environment , quantum decoherence and dissipation is usually the central impediment for maintaining the electron coherence . among the decoherence mechanisms , the non - markovian effect of nanostructures plays an important role @xcite . since the non - markovian entanglement dynamics has been well understood in the distinguishable particle systems @xcite , it is therefore natural to ask for an extension to the case of identical particle systems , especially for nanoelectronic systems consisting of identical fermions .",
    "the corresponding non - markovian fermionic entanglement dynamics of these systems are still virtually unexplored .    to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the decoherence dynamics , one has to rely on realistic and precise model calculations .",

    "on the other hand , the standard definition of entanglement is no longer valid for identical particles due to the conflicts between the indistinguishability of the system constituents and the tensor product structure @xcite of the hilbert space .",
    "a multitude of early studies are focusing on entanglement between fixed numbers of indistinguishable particles @xcite .",
    "in general case , however , the particle numbers of an open system are not conserved , it is therefore reasonable to consider the entanglement between fermionic modes , in a similar way as is conventionally done for bosonic modes @xcite .    in this paper ,",
