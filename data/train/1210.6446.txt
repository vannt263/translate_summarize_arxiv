    "finding the physical origin of the accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the most important scientific problems of our time , and is driving important advances in xxist century cosmology .",
    "several observational probes to study the nature of the mysterious dark energy , which powers that expansion , have been proposed . among them , the measurement of the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the galaxy power spectrum as a function of redshift is one of the most robust , since it is insensitive to systematic uncertainties related to the astrophysical properties of the galaxies .",
    "moreover , it provides information about dark energy from two different sources : the angular diameter distance , through the measurement of the bao scale in the angular distribution of galaxies , and the hubble parameter , through the measurement of the bao scale in the radial distribution of galaxies .",
    "there are some measurements of the bao scale in the purely radial direction @xcite , but most of them use mainly the monopole of the 3-d correlation function .",
    "this has been the traditional way of determining the bao scale , trying to optimize the sensitivity when the number of galaxies in the survey is not very high , paying the price of introducing model dependence in the measurement through the use of a fiducial model .",
    "however , the new galaxy surveys which are already taking data or those proposed for the future do not suffer from this problem and new and more robust methods can be used .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method to extract the evolution of the radial bao scale with the redshift , and explain how to use it as a standard ruler to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "we use data from galaxy surveys in a manner that is fully cosmology independent , since only observable quantities are used in the analysis and therefore , results are unbiased . a method based on the same idea for the measurement of the angular bao scale",
    "was described in  @xcite and provided the measurement of the angular bao scale presented in @xcite .",
    "here we present how to extract the radial bao scale using a similar approach .",
    "the method is designed to be used as a strict standard ruler , and provides the radial bao scale as a function of the redshift , but we do not intend to give a full description of the radial correlation function . this approach is more robust against systematic effects , and in fact we demonstrate that the measurement is only limited by cosmic variance , since the associated systematic errors are much smaller than the purely statistical errors .",
    "one of the main statistical probes of the properties of the matter distribution in the universe is the 2-point correlation function , @xmath0 , which is defined as the excess joint probability that two point sources ( _ e.g. _ galaxies ) are found in two volume elements @xmath1 separated by a distance @xmath2 compared to a homogeneous poisson distribution  @xcite .",
    "if the fluctuations on the matter density field are gaussian , this function contains all the information about the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "however , what is observationally accesible is the distribution of galaxies in angle - redshift space , not directly the matter distribution in real space . for each galaxy",
    "we determine its angular position in the sky and its redshift . to obtain @xmath0 we need to convert the measured redshift to a comoving distance , for which a cosmological model is needed .",
    "therefore , the 3-d correlation function is not observable in a cosmology independent way for a given galaxy survey .",
    "moreover , the observational techniques to obtain the angular position in the sky and the redshift are completely different and independent . consequently ,",
    "if we want to keep the measurement completely free of any theoretical interpretation , we should measure , on the one hand , the angular correlation function as a function of the angular separation of galaxy pairs , and on the other hand , the radial correlation function as a function of the redshift separation of galaxy pairs , and then extract the bao scale from each function . both of them are defined in complete analogy with the 3-d function , as the excess of probability with respect to a homogeneous poisson distribution , and both are observable in a cosmology independent way , providing , together , information about the full 3-d large scale structure that can be described in any cosmological model .",
    "these aspects have been recently pointed out in @xcite , and here we present a practical implementation of a cosmology independent measurement , in this case for the radial bao scale .    several effects must be taken into account when the large scale structure of the universe is studied from galaxy surveys , like bias , redshift space distortions and non - linear corrections . in this paper",
    "we take all of them into account , both in the theoretical calculations and in the observational analysis . for this particular measurement",
    ", the influence of the non - linear effects is relatively small , since we are analyzing large scales , around the bao scale .",
    "also the influence of bias is small , because the analysis method is designed to minimize its impact on the final result .",
    "however , redshift space distortions are very important , since we are measuring along the line of sight .",
    "the bao are a consequence of the competition between gravitational attraction and gas pressure in the primordial plasma , which produced sound waves .",
    "differences in density created by these sound waves leave a relic signal in the statistical distribution of matter in the universe , defining a preferred scale , the sound horizon scale at the baryon drag epoch , which is a robust standard ruler from which the expansion history of the universe can be inferred .",
    "the bao scale is very large , @xmath3 mpc / h , which poses an important challenge for observations , since surveys must cover large volumes to map such a distance .",
    "however , the very large scale of bao also has certain advantages , because structure formation at these scales is rather well understood , and details about the description of galaxy formation and astrophysics do not compromise the accurate measurements of the standard ruler . in practice ,",
    "the strength of the bao standard ruler method relies on the potential to relate the position of the acoustic peak in the correlation function of galaxies to the sound horizon scale at decoupling .",
    "the current measurements of the bao scale typically use the spherically symmetric monopole contribution of the 3-d correlation function .",
    "this is a mixture of the angular and radial scales , and therefore , does not contain all the information that can be extracted from the data samples . on top of that",
    ", all analyses have been done using what is usually called a `` fiducial model '' in order to determine distances . rather than full tests of the cosmology",
    ", they should be understood as precision measurements within the context of the standard @xmath4cdm cosmological model . considering this way of analyzing data",
    ", what the current results have achieved is a strong confirmation of the consistency of the current data with the standard @xmath4cdm model , but the analysis strategy is very limited if one wants to test other non - flrw cosmological models against data , or at least , the whole analysis must be repeated from the very begining for every cosmological model one tries to test .    on the other hand , if both the angular and the radial bao scales are determined , which in principle is already possible with current data sets , the cosmological constraints that can be set using only the bao scale are much stronger than the current values , since the radial and angular scales are sensitive to cosmological parameters in quite different ways , breaking degeneracies and allowing a very precise determination when combined .",
    "the method we propose relies on a parametrization of the radial correlation function which allows extracting the radial bao scale with precision .",
    "it is based on a similar approach previously proposed for the angular correlation function  @xcite .",
    "the suggested parametrization was inspired by the application of the kaiser effect to the shape we used for the angular correlation function .",
    "it is important to remark that the calculations we perform to check the goodness of the parametrization do include redshift space distortions using the kaiser description @xcite and also non - linearities using the rpt approach @xcite , and we expect the result to be correct for large scales , where the neglected effects ( fingers of god , mode - mode coupling ) are very small . we have used a bias parameter @xmath5 throughout the calculation .",
    "the possible influence of bias is studied in the systematic errors section .",
    "we use the linear power spectrum from camb @xcite , on top of which non - linearities and redshift space distortions are then included .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we have used a theoretical estimation of the covariance matrix for the 3-d correlation function , which is then applied to the estimation of the covariance for the radial correlation function .",
    "our approach is based on assuming gaussian statistics for the overdensity field , in analogy with the approach in @xcite for the monopole and with the method described in @xcite for the angular correlation function .",
    "we have used the following convention for the power spectrum : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dirac and kronecker deltas , @xmath9 is the volume and we have taken into account the poisson contribution to the total variance as the inverse of the number density of sources @xmath10 .",
    "the anisotropic power spectrum can be estimated from a given realization of @xmath11 by averaging over the symmetric azimuthal angle : @xmath12    assuming that @xmath13 is gaussianly distributed we can obtain the covariance for this estimator using wick s theorem : @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as is done in @xcite , the effect of a non - homogeneous number density @xmath15 has been taken into account by defining the volume - averaged variance @xmath16 the anisotropic power spectrum can be related to the anisotropic correlation function using the 0-order cylindrical bessel function @xmath17 through @xmath18 and thus the covariance matrix for @xmath19 can be calculated as @xmath20 here we have taken into account the finiteness of the bins @xmath21 , @xmath22 by defining the regularized functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25    from this result it is straightforward to compute the covariance matrix for the radial correlation function ( @xmath26 ) as @xmath27 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where we have defined the projected @xmath28-space variance @xmath29 ^ 2\\equiv    \\int^{\\infty}_{0}dk_{\\perp}\\,k_{\\perp }    \\left[2\\frac{j_1(k_{\\perp}\\,\\delta\\sigma)}{k_{\\perp}\\,\\delta\\sigma}\\right]^2    \\mathfrak{p}^2(k_{\\parallel},k_{\\perp}).\\ ] ] here the radial coordinate @xmath30 is related to the redshift separation through @xmath31 , and the transverse width @xmath22 is related to the angular pixel resolution through @xmath32 . as can be verified on closer inspection of equation [ eq : kspace_variance ] ,",
    "the covariance grows dramatically as we decrease the pixel size .",
    "this is due to the fact that the number of galaxy pairs drops and the errors become shot - noise dominated .    throughout this work ,",
    "gaussian estimations for the covariance matrices were used .",
    "figure [ fig : covariances ] shows the gaussian predictions for the reduced covariance matrix @xmath33 of the radial correlation function ( left panel ) , the angular correlation function ( central panel ) and the monopole ( right panel ) .",
    "the axis ranges correspond to similar comoving scales in the three cases .",
    "notice that , while the errors on the radial correlation function are almost diagonal , they are correlated over a large range of scales in the angular ( transverse ) case .",
    "for the monopole , the errors are also correlated over a large number of bins , which is a sensible result , since the monopole corresponds to an angular average over two transverse and one longitudinal directions .",
    "the angular bao measurements we have used for the results presented in the text have been obtained applying the method described in @xcite to the cosmological simulation used in this paper .",
    "we have used 10 redshift bins of width 0.1 , starting at redshift 0.2 up to redshift 1.2 .",
    "we find statistically significant results in 9 of them .",
    "results are presented in figure  [ fig : thetabao_vs_z ] .",
    "these are the results we combine with the radial bao in order to obtain the cosmological constraints presented in the text .",
    "it is important to notice that the redshifts for this galaxy sample are spectroscopic and consequently , the systematic error associated to the photometric redshift that is quoted on @xcite does not affect these measurements ."
