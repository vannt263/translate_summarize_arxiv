    "for each @xmath2 , define the quantity @xmath7 where maximum is taken over all possible products of @xmath4 matrices from the set @xmath5 , and @xmath8 denotes the spectral radius of a matrix , that is the maximal magnitude of its eigenvalues .",
    "clearly , if @xmath9 then some matrices in the product @xmath10 will occur several times .",
    "the limit @xmath11 is called _ the generalized spectral radius _ of the matrix set @xmath5 @xcite .    similarly , given a norm @xmath12 in @xmath13 , for each @xmath2 , define the quantity @xmath14 where @xmath15 , for a matrix @xmath16 , is the matrix norm generated by the vector norm @xmath12 in @xmath13 , that is @xmath17 .",
    "then the limit @xmath18 does not depend on the choice of the norm @xmath12 and is called _ the joint spectral radius _ of the matrix set @xmath5 @xcite . when @xmath19 this definition coincides with the famous gelfand formula for the spectral radius of a matrix @xcite as in this case @xmath20 is a singleton matrix set and @xmath21 .    for matrix sets @xmath5 consisting of a finite amount of matrices , as is our case , the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 coincide with each other @xcite and their common value is denoted as @xmath24 while the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 form lower and upper bounds , respectively , for the joint / generalized spectral radius : @xmath27 this last formula may serve as a basis for a posteriori estimating the accuracy of computation of @xmath28 .",
    "the first algorithms of a kind in the context of control theory problems have been suggested in @xcite , for linear inclusions in @xcite , and for problems of wavelet theory in @xcite .",
    "later the computational efficiency of these algorithms was essentially improved in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the common feature of all such algorithms is that they do not provide any bounds for the number of computational steps required to get desired accuracy of approximation of @xmath28 .",
    "recently , in @xcite explicit computable estimates for the rate of convergence of the quantities @xmath29 to @xmath30 end their extension to the case of the joint spectral radius were obtained .",
    "probably , these results will help to make more constructive the problem of evaluating of @xmath28 by the generalized gelfand formula .",
    "some works suggest different formulas to compute @xmath28 .",

    "such a matrix set was called quasi - controllable . ]",
    "the infimum in ( [ e - inf ] ) is attained , and for such matrix sets there are norms @xmath12 in @xmath13 , called _ extremal norms _ , for which @xmath38    in analysis of the joint spectral radius ideas suggested by n.e .",
    "barabanov @xcite play an important role .",
    "these ideas have got further development in a variety of publications among which we would like to distinguish @xcite .",
    "let the matrix set @xmath0 be irreducible .",
    "then the quantity @xmath39 is the joint ( generalized ) spectral radius of the set @xmath5 iff there is a norm @xmath12 in @xmath13 such that @xmath40    throughout the paper , a norm satisfying ( [ eq - mane - bar ] ) will be called a _",

    "similarly , as is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 3.3 ) and @xcite , the value of @xmath39 equals to @xmath28 if and only if for some central - symmetric convex body @xmath41 the following equality holds @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the convex hull of a set and @xmath44 . as is noted in @xcite , the relation ( [ e - protset ] )",
    "was proved by a.n .",
    "dranishnikov and s.v .",
    "konyagin , so it is natural to call the central - symmetric set @xmath41 the _ dranishnikov - konyagin - protasov set_. the set @xmath41 can be treated as the unit ball of some norm @xmath12 in @xmath35 ( recently this norm is usually called the _ protasov norm _ ) .",
    "note that barabanov and protasov norms are the extremal norms , that is they satisfy the inequality ( [ e - extnorm ] ) . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that barabanov and protasov norms are dual to each other .",
    "remark that formulas ( [ e - extnorm ] ) , ( [ eq - mane - bar ] ) and ( [ e - protset ] ) define the joint or generalized spectral radius for a matrix set in an apparently computationally nonconstructive manner . in spite of that ,",
    "namely such formulas underlie quite a number of theoretical constructions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and algorithms @xcite for computation of @xmath28 .",
    "different approaches for constructing barabanov norms to analyze properties of the joint ( generalized ) spectral radius are discussed , e.g. , in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.6 ) . in @xcite",
    "the method of barabanov norms was the key instrument in disproving the lagarias - wang finiteness conjecture .",
    "the related constructions were essentially based on the study of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of some specific barabanov norms . in @xcite",
    "the method of extremal polytope norms was the key tool in investigation of the finiteness properties of pairs of @xmath45 matrices .    in this context the situation when one fails to find among current publications any detailed analysis of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of barabanov norms looks a bit paradoxical .",
    "partially this is explained by the fact that barabanov norms are defined nonconstructively , by an implicit procedure .",
    "so , even in simplest cases it is very difficult to visualize the shape of their unit balls .",
    "the present work may be treated as the first step to make up this deficiency .    in the paper , an iteration procedure",
    "is considered that allows to build numerically barabanov norms for the irreducible matrix sets and simultaneously to compute the joint spectral radius of these sets .",
    "a similar iteration procedure is also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in introduction",
    "we give basic definitions and present the motivation of the work . in section  [ s - iterscheme ] the main iteration procedure is introduced and main theorem stating convergence of this procedure is formulated .",
    "the iteration procedure under consideration is called the max - relaxation procedure since in it the next approximation to the barabanov norm is constructed as the maximum of the current approximation and some auxiliary norm . in section  [ mtproof ]",
    "proof main theorem is given . in section  [ s - comp2d ] , to build simplest examples , the max - relaxation scheme is adapted for computations with @xmath46 matrices .",
    "results of numerical tests are illustrated by two examples . in section  [ s - app ]",
    "we present the matlab code illustrating computations in example  [ ex2 ] . at last , in concluding section  [ s - rem ] we discuss some shortcomings of the proposed approach and formulate further unresolved problems .",
    "given @xmath47 , let @xmath0 be an irreducible set of @xmath1 real matrices .    throughout the paper , a continuous function @xmath48 defined for @xmath49 and satisfying @xmath50",
    "will be called _ an averaging function_. examples for averaging functions are : @xmath51    given some averaging function @xmath52 , a norm @xmath53 in @xmath13 , and a vector @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , construct recursively the norms @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , in accordance with the following rules :    * mr1 : * _ if the norm @xmath56 has been already defined compute the quantities _ @xmath59    * mr2 : * _ define the norms @xmath60 and _ @xmath61 : @xmath62    remark that the number of operations needed to perform one step of algorithm * mr1-mr2 * is of order @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of operations needed to compute , for an arbitrary vector @xmath65 , the value of the norm @xmath66 with a relative accuracy @xmath67 . in general ,",
    "the value @xmath64 is of order @xmath68 .",
    "so , the total number of operations needed to perform @xmath4 steps of algorithm * mr1-mr2 * has the same rate of growth as @xmath69 .",
    "remark also , that the procedure ( [ e - lohibounds ] ) of calculation of @xmath70 resembles the technique of iterative approximation of the joint spectral radius suggested in @xcite .    for any irreducible matrix set @xmath5 , nonzero vector @xmath54 , initial norm @xmath53 , and any averaging function @xmath48 , the sequences @xmath71 constructed by the iteration procedure * mr1 * , * mr2 * converge to @xmath72 , and the sequence of norms @xmath56 converges uniformly on each bounded set to some barabanov norm @xmath73 of the matrix set @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the sequence @xmath74 is nondecreasing , the sequence @xmath75 is nonincreasing , and @xmath76 for all @xmath77 , which provides an a posteriori estimate for the computational error of @xmath72 .",
    "let us suppose that we managed to prove the following assertions :    a1 : :    _ the sequences @xmath75 and    @xmath74 are convergent ; _ a2 : :    _ the limits of the sequences @xmath75 and    @xmath74 coincide : _",
    "@xmath78 a3 : :    _ the norms @xmath57 converge pointwise to a    limit @xmath73 .",
    "_    then the function @xmath73 will be a semi - norm in @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , by ( [ e - newnorm ] ) each norm @xmath57 meets the normalization condition @xmath79 , and hence @xmath80 which implies @xmath81 .",
    "note also that due to ( [ e - newnorm ] ) the norms @xmath57 differ from @xmath56 only by numerical factors .",
    "therefore , the quantities @xmath70 can be defined as @xmath82 then , passing to the limit in ( [ e - lohibounds - x ] ) , one can conclude that the semi - norm @xmath83 satisfies the _ barabanov condition _ @xmath84 but as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , any semi - norm @xmath81 satisfying the barabanov condition for an irreducible matrix set is a barabanov norm .",
    "thus , under assumptions * a1 * , * a2 * and * a3 * , the iteration procedure ( [ e - lohibounds])([e - newnorm ] ) allows to build a barabanov norm and to find the joint spectral radius of the matrix set @xmath5 .",
    "so , to complete the proof of main theorem we need to justify assertions * a1 * , * a2 * and * a3 * which will be done in sections  [ s - convnorm][s - fina2 ] . in section  [ s - convnorm ]",
    "we establish convergence of the sequence of norms @xmath85 to some limit which allows to prove in lemma  [ l - a3true ] that assertion * a3 * is a corollary of assertions * a1 * and * a2*. section  [ s - rhorel ] demonstrates that the quantities @xmath74 form the family of lower bounds for the joint spectral radius @xmath39 of the matrix set @xmath5 , while the quantities @xmath75 form the family of upper bounds for @xmath39 . in section  [ s - convrho ] we prove that the sequences @xmath71 are bounded and monotone which implies the existence of the limits @xmath86 and @xmath87 . at last , in sections  [ s - newnorms ] and [ s - omega ] we prove that @xmath88 which allows to justify in section  [ s - fina2 ] the validity of assertions * a1 * and * a2 * and thus to finalize the proof of main theorem .      given a pair of norms @xmath89 and @xmath90 in @xmath13 define the quantities @xmath91    since all norms in @xmath13 are equivalent to each other , the quantities @xmath92 and @xmath93 are correctly defined and @xmath94 therefore the quantity @xmath95 which is called _ the eccentricity _ of the norm @xmath89 with respect to the norm @xmath90 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , is also correctly defined .",

    "<S> partially this is explained by the fact that barabanov norms are defined nonconstructively , by an implicit procedure . </S>",
