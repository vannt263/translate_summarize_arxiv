    "where the lower part of the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence , three distinct classes of multiperiodically pulsating variables can be found . the @xmath9  doradus stars pulsate in gravity modes of high radial order and have periods of the order of one day ( kaye et al .",
    "the @xmath5 scuti stars have periods of the order of a few hours ( breger 1979 ) and are thus pressure and gravity mode pulsators of low radial order .",
    "the fastest pulsations in this domain in the hr diagram are however excited in the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars ( kurtz 1982 , kurtz & martinez 2000 ) , with typical periods around 10 minutes , indicating pressure modes of high radial overtones .",
    "the photometric semi - amplitudes associated with these pulsations are in most cases only a few mmag , which makes them difficult to detect .",
    "the roap stars are also remarkable due to their spectral peculiarities , since they are pulsating representatives of cool magnetic ap stars of the srcreu subtype .",
    "the magnetic fields of ap stars cause elemental segregation on the stellar surface . in other words ,",
    "the chemical elements are arranged in patches on the stellar surface ( see , e.g. , kochukhov et al .",
    "2004 or lueftinger et al .",
    "2003 for well - documented examples ) .",
    "this causes modulation of the mean apparent brightness of the star with the rotation period .",
    "as the chemical elements show some alignment with the magnetic poles , the rotational light curves show a single - wave structure if only one magnetic pole is seen and a double - wave variation if both magnetic poles come into view during a rotation cycle .    the strong magnetic fields present in the roap stars are usually not aligned with the stellar rotation axis . since the pulsation axis does however coincide with the magnetic axis , the roap stars are oblique pulsators ( kurtz 1982 ) .",
    "this means that the pulsation modes excited in the roap stars are seen at different aspects during the rotation cycle , which , for nonradial modes , causes amplitude modulation over the rotation period ( which can then be inferred ) and allows us to put constraints on the geometry of the pulsator .    the oblique pulsator model ( opm ) , in its simplest form",
    ", then predicts that ( except for special geometric orientations of the axes ) dipole ( @xmath2 ) pulsation modes will be split into equally spaced triplets .",
    "quadrupole ( @xmath10 ) modes will give rise to equally spaced frequency quintuplets , where the spacing of consecutive multiplet components is exactly the stellar rotational frequency .    the magnetic field of the roap stars affects the pulsations in two additional ways .",
    "firstly , the pulsation frequencies are shifted with respect to their unperturbed value ( cunha & gough 2000 ) and secondly , the pulsation modes are distorted so that a single spherical harmonic can no longer describe them fully ( e.g. , kurtz , kanaan & martinez 1993 , takata & shibahashi 1995 ) .",
    "this is observationally manifested by the presence of additional multiplet components surrounding the first - order singlets , triplets or quintuplets , which are spaced by integer multiples of the rotation frequency .    for a long time , the predominant observing method for studying the pulsations of roap stars was time - resolved high - speed photometry , yielding interesting results on the pulsational behaviour , geometry and asteroseismology of these stars ( e.g. , see matthews , kurtz & martinez 1999 ) .",
    "the most recent observational advances however came from time - resolved spectroscopy : since the vertical wavelengths of the pulsation modes are comparable to the size of the line - forming regions in the atmospheres of these stars , the vertical structure of the atmospheres can be resolved ( ryabchikova et al .",
    "2002 , kurtz , elkin & mathys 2003 ) .",
    "spectroscopy is also more sensitive to the detection of roap star pulsations than photometry . due to the vertical stratification of chemical elements in their atmospheres ( e.g.  ryabchikova et al .",
    "2002 ) the pulsational radial velocity amplitudes of some spectral lines ( most notably rare earth elements ) can reach several kilometres per second .",
    "the most extreme example of such high radial velocity amplitudes is hd  99563 ( xy  crt ) .",
    "this star was photometrically discovered to pulsate by dorokhova & dorokhov ( 1998 ) and was confirmed by handler & paunzen ( 1999 ) .",
    "elkin , kurtz & mathys ( 2005 ) discovered pulsational radial velocity variations with semi - amplitudes of up 5  for some euii and tmii lines in their time - resolved spectroscopy of this star .",
    "such high amplitudes are capable of yielding information on the structure of the atmospheres of ap stars with the best possible signal to noise .",
    "however , one important piece of information that spectroscopy can not supply at this point is detailed knowledge of the stellar pulsation spectrum .",
    "the reason is that the largest telescopes are necessary for obtaining spectra of the required time resolution and signal to noise .",
    "however , observing time on these telescopes is sparse .",
    "therefore , lengthy photometric measurements of these stars on small telescopes are still required to decipher the pulsational spectra fully .    to this end , we included hd 99563 as a secondary target in a multi - site campaign originally devoted to the roap star hd 122970 ( handler et al.2002 ) to be observed at times when the latter star was not yet accessible . however , hd 99563 turned out to be quite interesting , which is why we continued to observe it after the original campaign was finished .",
    "we also acquired some mean - light observations of hd 99563 in an attempt to determine its rotation period . in this paper , we report the results of these measurements .",
    "our multi - site time - series photometric observations were obtained with seven different telescopes at four observatories : the 0.75 m t6 automatic photometric telescope at fairborn observatory ( fapt ) in arizona , the 0.5 m , 0.75 m , 1.0 m and 1.9 m telescopes at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , the 0.6 m reflector at siding spring observatory ( sso ) in australia and the 0.9 m telescope at observatorio de sierra nevada ( osn ) in spain . whereas the latter observations consisted of strmgren @xmath11 photometry , the other telescopes used the b filter only .",
    "the measurements are summarised in table 1 .",
    ".journal of the observations of hd 99563 ; @xmath12 is the number of 40-second data bins obtained in the respective night and @xmath13 is the rms scatter of the residual light curves after prewhitening and low - frequency filtering ; the remaining columns are self - explanatory . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from the values in table 5 it can be seen that the mode of hd 99563 is dominated by the dipole component , which is reasonable as the magnetic fields in ap stars are predominantly dipoles . the contribution of the @xmath4 and @xmath10 terms to the mode are fairly small , but the @xmath3 component does have some influence .",
    "table 6 shows that the observations are quite well reproduced by our fit",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the theory by saio & gautschy ( 2004 ) is capable of reproducing our results .",
    "we can now check how well our model reproduces the observed pulsational amplitudes and phases over the stellar rotation cycle . to this end",
    ", we subdivided the time series into pieces some @xmath14 pulsation cycles long and determined the amplitudes and phases for the 1557.653  @xmath0hz variation within these subsets .",
    "the spherical harmonic decomposition method by kurtz ( 1992 ) yields a fit to the amplitude / phase behaviour over the rotation cycle , and we show it together with the data in fig .  6 .",
    "we can see that both magnetic ( pulsation ) poles are actually in view for approximately the same amount of time ; the relative fractions are 53 and 47 per cent .",
    "this is also the reason why it was so difficult to determine the rotation period of the star ; the pulsations as well as the mean light variations are almost symmetrical along the rotation period .",
    "the fitted curves reproduce the observations fairly well , with one exception : the pulsation amplitude is overestimated for the pole that is for a shorter time in the line of sight , whereas the amplitude is underestimated for the other pole .",
    "the harmonic frequencies can not be made responsible for this , because they do not affect the first - order amplitudes analysed here .",
    "consequently , we believe that the poor fits near the pulsation amplitude maxima could be due to presently undetected additional multiplet components of the pulsation mode ; the amount of over- and under - fitting can be fully explained with the noise level in our residual amplitude spectrum .",
    "our photometric multisite observations of the roap star hd 99563 resulted in the detection of a frequency quintuplet that is due to a single distorted dipole pulsation mode .",
    "the splitting within this frequency quintuplet together with our mean light observations and published magnetic measurements allowed us to determine the stellar rotation period as @xmath1  d. within the errors , the mean light extrema occur in phase with pulsation amplitude maximum , suggesting that the abundance spots on hd 99563 should be fairly concentric around its magnetic poles .    to our knowledge",
    ", hd 99563 is only the fourth roap star where both magnetic poles become visible throughout a rotation cycle ( the others are hr 3831 , e.g. , see kurtz et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , hd 6532 , e.g. , kurtz et al.(1996 ) , and hd 80316 e.g. , kurtz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) , and only the third whose pulsational mode distortion has been quantified . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that the observational features of hd 99563 are in many aspects similar to another roap star , the well - studied hr 3831 ( e.g. , kurtz et al .",
    "1993 , kochukhov 2004 ) : their geometrical orientations , rotation period and effective temperatures are alike .",
    "only the pulsation period of hd 99563 is some 10 per cent shorter , and the phases its first - order combination frequencies are more consistent with them being harmonics .",
    "it would thus be very interesting to compare these two objects in detail .",
    "this would however require more in - depth studies of hd 99563 .",
    "its basic parameters are still poorly known ; the radius we inferred is based on the assumption that the visual companion is physical , which needs to be checked .",
    "if hd 99563 a and b were a physical pair , then the separation of the components is too wide for motion around a common centre of mass to be determined in a reasonable period of time .",
    "however , common proper motion may be detectable within a few years .",
    "the most efficient way to pin down the radius of the roap star would perhaps come from a combination of magnetic and polarisation measurements ( landolfi et al .",
    "1997 ) . with that , the inclination @xmath15 and the magnetic obliquity @xmath16 can be constrained , and given the accurate rotation period and @xmath17 already available , a fairly accurate radius could be obtained .",
    "there are several other possibilities that make hd 99563 interesting for future observations . as already argued by elkin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the star is a very attractive target for pulsational radial velocity measurements .",
    "given the high amplitude of the mean light variations of the star and its favourable geometry , doppler imaging of its surface should also be within reach .",
    "finally , we have evidence that we have not yet deciphered the full pulsational content of the star s light curves .",
    "another multi - site campaign , aiming at obtaining @xmath18  h of observations on 1-metre - class telescopes would therefore also be justifiable .",
    "as we pointed out , hd 99563b is located within the @xmath5 scuti instability strip and should therefore also be tested for pulsations , with more suitable means than ours .",
    "the austrian fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung partially supported this work under grants s7303-ast and s7304-ast .",
    "we are grateful to don kurtz for supplying results prior to publication , for helpful discussions and for comments on a draft version of this paper .",
    "we also thank hiromoto shibahashi for his accurate referee s report ."
