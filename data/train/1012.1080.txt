    "over thirty years ago leinaas and myrheim pointed out @xcite , that in systems confined to two spatial dimensions particles with exotic exchange statistics , more general than those of bosons and fermions , are possible .",
    "such particles with arbitrary exchange statistics were later coined _ anyons _ by wilzeck  @xcite . today",
    "it is widely believed that this possibility is indeed realized in the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "an even more intriguing form of statistics has recently received considerable attention , namely that of non - abelian statistics , first proposed in a seminal paper by moore and read@xcite .",
    "this form of statistics can occur in two - dimensional systems in which introducing excitations gives rise to a _",
    "macroscopic degeneracy _ of states . upon braiding the excitations , the wave function ( or better",
    ", the vector of wave functions ) describing the system , does not merely acquire an overall phase , but can actually transform into one another , as described by a unitary braid matrix acting within the degenerate manifold . in general , these braid matrices do not commute , hence the name non - abelian statistics . while several systems have been theoretically proposed to exhibit quasiparticles with non - abelian statistics , such as unconventional @xmath2 superconductors @xcite , rotating bose - einstein condensates @xcite , or certain heterostructures involving a novel class of materials , so - called topological insulators @xcite , the system currently being cast under intense experimental scrutiny is the fractional quantum hall effect observed at filling fraction @xmath3 , with some evidence suggesting that this state is indeed non - abelian in nature  @xcite .",
    "an early attempt to describe this @xmath3 quantum hall state came in the form of the so - called haldane - rezayi wave function@xcite , which can be thought of as a @xmath4-wave paired bcs condensate of composite fermions ",
    "electrons with , in this case , two flux quanta attached .",
    "a peculiar feature of the haldane - rezayi state is that its gapless edge modes are described by a _ non - unitary _ conformal field theory @xcite with central charge @xmath5 .",
    "however , non - unitary dynamics can not describe a physical system as it would violate basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "it has therefore been argued that in general the non - unitary nature of an edge state indicates that the underlying phase is not bulk gapped , but in fact critical @xcite in which case the edge states lose their identity as they dissipate into the gapless bulk . for the haldane - rezayi state it indeed turns out that it does not describe a gapped topological phase , but rather the gapless state at a quantum phase transition between two gapped states  the moore - read quantum hall state  @xcite and a so - called strong pairing quantum hall phase  @xcite . since the work of haldane and rezayi many other wave functions have been proposed , which appear to have non - unitary edge state theories @xcite .",
    "one particularly well - known example is the so - called ` gaffnian state'@xcite .",
    "these proposed states typically arise from numerical studies of model hamiltonians , for which it is oftentimes hard to determine whether they describe a gapped or gapless phase .",
    "the ultimate fate of these newly proposed states has therefore remained an active field of research .",
    "in this paper , we will study the excitations of the putative quantum liquid described by such non - unitary wave functions from an ` anyon - model ' perspective .",
    "thus , we explore the physics that would occur if one were to assume that such excitations indeed exist and study in detail their collective behavior that would result .",
    "we refer to these excitations as non - unitary anyons and model the interaction between these anyons in the same way as it was done in the unitary case @xcite .",
    "it will turn out that the hamiltonians one is led to consider for the non - unitary anyons are , not surprisingly , non - hermitian .",
    "nevertheless , the energy spectrum turns out to be completely real .",
    "one can hope that the results of such a study would shed some light on the questions surrounding the physical meaning of non - unitary anyons .",
    "of course , in the context of two - dimensional _ classical _ statistical mechanics models having a non - unitary conformal field theory ( cft ) describing a critical phase is a situation which often occurs ",
    "see , for instance , the ( restricted ) height models described in ref .",
    ", which are generalizations of the ` restricted solid - on - solid ' models@xcite  and is not problematic .",
    "before closing this introduction with the outline of the paper , we should mention one additional point , which motivates the study on non - unitary anyon models : the concept of ` galois - conjugation ' of conformal field theories . in short , the action of the galois group relates different cft s which have the same number of fields , obeying the same fusion rules .",
    "the non - unitary models we encounter in this paper , are in fact galois - conjugates of unitary cft s , and thus , the study on non - unitary anyons is closely related to the study of galois conjugation in conformal field theory  @xcite . for the purposes of this paper we will however not need to use any details of these connections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : yl - chains ] we discuss the yang - lee anyonic chains .",
    "we start by giving a review of the derivation of the hamiltonian of the ( ordinary , i.e. unitary ) golden chain @xcite of fibonacci anyons in sec .",

    "we then discuss the phase diagram in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasediag ] , present the analytical solution at special critical points in sec .",

    "[ sec : yl - ladder - num ] .",
    "the final section summarizes the results and discusses their relevance to hypothetical non - unitary topological phases .",
    "an appendix contains a detailed discussion of the conformal energy spectra at the four critical points discussed in the two models .",
    "at the focus of this manuscript are anyonic models that are certain _ non - unitary _ generalizations of unitary non - abelian anyon models , which have been extensively studied in the recent past @xcite .",
    "the basic constituents of the generalizations considered here are non - unitary , non - abelian anyons . like their unitary counterparts they carry a quantum number that corresponds to a generalized angular momentum in so - called su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theories , which are certain deformations @xcite of su(2 ) .",
    "we first concentrate on an elementary example where there is only a single anyon type by explicitly considering the anyon theory su(2)@xmath7 . in the unitary version of this theory",
    "the elementary degrees of freedom are often referred to as ` fibonacci anyons ' , and it is their non - unitary counterparts which we term ` yang - lee anyons ' .",
    "we will return to a discussion of the non - unitary generalizations for general su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theories in section  [ sec : su2k ] .",
    "we start by quickly reviewing the basic construction of microscopic ( chain ) models of interacting non - abelian anyons , following the ideas of the ` golden chain ' model of ref .   and the detailed exposition of ref .  .",
    "the construction of these models proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we describe the general structure of the hilbert space of these models in a particular ` fusion chain ' representation , which is identical for the unitary and non - unitary models . in a second step we turn to the microscopic form of the hamiltonian capturing interactions between the anyons . while this second step is quite similar for the unitary and non - unitary cases , the microscopic hamiltonians for the two cases are distinct .",
    "the elementary degrees of freedom in our microscopic model are the particle types ( or generalized angular momenta ) of the su(2)@xmath7 anyonic theory . in its simplest form",
    "( considering only integer momenta ) this theory contains a trivial particle ( or vacuum state ) , which we denote by @xmath8 , and an anyonic particle , which we label as @xmath9 .",
    "these particles can form combined states according to the fusion rules @xmath10 the non - abelian nature of the anyonic @xmath9-particle reveals itself in the _ multiple _ fusion outcomes when combining two of these particles .",
    "s in the upper row ) .",
    "the set of admissible labelings @xmath11 along the fusion chain ( lines ) constitutes the hilbert space of the yang - lee ( and fibonacci ) chains . ]",
    "our chain model then consists of @xmath12 such @xmath9-particles in a one - dimensional arrangement as depicted on the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : fusiontree ] , where @xmath12 denotes the number of sites of the chain .",
    "since pairs of @xmath9-particles can be fused into more than one state , such a system of @xmath12 non - abelian anyons spans a _",
    "_ manifold of states , i.e. a vector space whose dimension grows exponentially in the number of anyons .",
    "it is this manifold of states that constitutes the hilbert space of our microscopic model . to enumerate the states in the latter we define a so - called ` fusion chain ' as illustrated on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : fusiontree ] . here",
    "the original @xmath9-particles constituting the chain are denoted by the lines which are ` incoming ' from above .",
    "the links in the fusion chain carry labels @xmath13 which again correspond to the particle types of the su(2)@xmath7 theory . reading the labels from left to right a labeling",
    "is called admissible if at each vertex the fusion rules of su(2)@xmath7 are obeyed , i.e. a @xmath9 label is followed by either a @xmath8 or @xmath9 label , while a @xmath8 label is always followed by a @xmath9 label .",
    "every such admissible labeling then constitutes one state in the hilbert space of our anyonic chain .",
    "considering periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath14 , it is straight forward to show that the dimension of the hilbert space is given in terms of fibonacci numbers as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17-th fibonacci number , defined by @xmath18 and the initial conditions @xmath19 .",
    "we now proceed to the second step of our construction , the derivation of a microscopic hamiltonian . in doing",
    "so we follow the perspective of the original ` golden chain ' model @xcite in assuming that interactions between a pair of neighboring @xmath9 particles  mediated , for instance , by topological charge tunneling @xcite  will result in an energy splitting of the two possible fusion outcomes in eq .  .",
    "our hamiltonian captures this splitting by projecting the fusion outcome of two neighboring @xmath9 particles onto the trivial fusion channel , i.e. assigning an energy of @xmath20 to the fusion of two @xmath9 particles into the trivial channel and an energy of @xmath21 to the fusion into the @xmath9 channel .",
    "this anyonic hamiltonian is thus reminiscent of the common heisenberg hamiltonian for su(2 ) spins , which , for instance , projects two ordinary spin-1/2 s onto the singlet channel and assigns a higher energy to the alternative triplet channel .",
    "-symbol describing the local change of basis . ]    to explicitly derive the hamiltonian in the hilbert space of fusion chain labelings introduced above , we note that in this basis the fusion of two neighboring @xmath9 particles is not explicit . to get direct access to this fusion channel of two neighboring @xmath9 particles",
    ", we need to locally transform the basis as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsymbol ] . the matrix describing this transformation",
    "is typically called the @xmath22-symbol , which can be thought of as an anyonic generalization of wigner s @xmath23-symbol for ordinary @xmath24 spins .",
    "its general form ( in the absence of fusion multiplicities ) is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fgeneral ] .    -symbol . ]    assuming that we know the explicit form of the @xmath22-symbols ( see the next section for more details ) , we can now explicitly derive the microscopic hamiltonian in the fusion chain basis .",
    "after the basis transformation , the fusion channel of the two neighboring anyons is manifest , so by means of a simple projection we can assign an energy to each of the fusion channels .",
    "the final step left after this projection , is to transform back to the original basis , which again employs the @xmath22-symbol .    to make the individual steps of this derivation more explicit , we consider the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : fsymbol ] in more detail .",
    "let us specify the five possible labelings of three neighboring fusion chain labels @xmath25 , where in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsymbol ] we depicted the case where the site label is @xmath26 , @xmath27 after performing the basis transformation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsymbol ] , the following labels satisfy the fusion rules at each vertex and thus form the new basis @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fusion channel of the two neighboring @xmath9 particles . in the transformed basis , we can project onto the trivial channel , by means of a projection @xmath30 , where the subscript @xmath17 denotes that we are acting on anyons @xmath17 and @xmath31 , while the label @xmath32 denotes we are projecting onto the @xmath32 channel .",
    "so , the part of the hamiltonian acting on anyons @xmath17 and @xmath31 , which we denote by @xmath33 , acts on the hilbert space as @xmath34 here , we have used that for the su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theories we are considering , the @xmath22-symbols are their own inverses .",
    "moreover , we projected onto the @xmath32 channel , which we favored , because of the overall minus sign .",
    "the total hamiltonian then simply becomes the sum of over all positions @xmath35 where we assume periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath14 .    to describe the hamiltonian of the various types of anyon chains we consider in this paper , we only have to specify the explicit form of the @xmath22-symbols ( apart from the fusion rules , which determine the hilbert space ) . the explicit form of the hamiltonian then follows from equation .",
    "now that we have expressed the hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath22-symbols , we should explain how to obtain the @xmath22-symbols for a given anyon theory .",
    "as stated , the @xmath22-symbols transform between two different fusion bases as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fgeneral ] . as such",
    ", the exact form of the these symbols can be determined self - consistently by identifying a circular sequence of basis transformations , which yield a set of strongly overconstrained nonlinear equations called the ` pentagon equations ' ( for a more detailed exposition see , for instance , refs .   and ) . while finding a solution to these pentagon equations",
    "is in general a highly non - trivial task , it has been shown that they allow only for a _",
    "finite _ set of inequivalent solutions , a property which goes under the name of ` ocneanu rigidity ' , see for instance ref .  .",
    "for the su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theories of interest here , the complete set of possible @xmath22-symbols can be found , e.g. , in ref .   where they were obtained by using quantum group techniques .",
    "the different @xmath22-symbols are found to have a general form that depends on a single , so - called ` deformation parameter ' @xmath36 only .",
    "this deformation parameter has to be chosen appropriately @xcite and it turns out that for the su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theory it must be one of the @xmath37 primitive roots of unity , i.e. of the form @xmath38 where the integer index @xmath39 runs from @xmath40 ( and @xmath39 and @xmath41 are relative prime ) .",
    "the process of increasing the index @xmath39 by one , i.e. going from one root of unity to the next , is what is usually referred to as _",

    "[ fig : yangleeanyons ] .",
    "these two galois conjugated theories corresponding to deformation parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then precisely correspond to the cases of fibonacci and yang - lee anyons , respectively .",
    "the explicit form of the @xmath22-symbols and in particular the non - diagonal @xmath44 matrix for @xmath45 can then be written @xcite in terms of this deformation parameter @xmath36 as @xmath46 for fibonacci anyons we set @xmath42 , in which case @xmath47 is the golden ratio , and the @xmath22-symbol becomes the _ unitary _ matrix @xmath48 the golden ratio , of course , is one solution of the equation @xmath49 , which is an algebraic analog of the fusion rule @xmath50 of the su(2)@xmath7 anyonic theory .",
    "the process of taking the galois conjugate of the original fibonacci anyon model corresponds then simply to the substitution @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the other solution to the equation @xmath53 . in terms of the deformation parameter @xmath36 , this amounts to choosing the other possible value of @xmath43 , which indeed yields @xmath54 .",

    "the hamiltonians take the following forms@xcite @xmath59    before discussing these anyonic models in further detail , we note that while galois conjugation changes some aspects of these models , i.e. the parameters in their respective hamiltonians get ` galois conjugated ' , this turns out to be a rather mild change , since the underlying algebraic structure of these models remains largely untouched . as a consequence , the non - unitary yang - lee chains allow for an analytic solution similar to their unitary counterparts as first obtained for the ` golden chain ' model in ref .  .",

    "in this paper , we studied the collective states of yang - lee anyons , a family of non - unitary , non - abelian anyons which are close cousins of the unitary fibonacci anyons",
    ". non - unitary anyons of this form have attracted interest in the context of studies of certain quantum hall wavefunctions , including the gaffnian state @xcite .",
    "both yang - lee and fibonacci anyons arise from the same anyonic theory , su(2)@xmath7 , and in particular they share the same fusion rules .",
    "the key distinction between the two anyon types is that yang - lee anyons are non - unitary and relate to their unitary counterparts , the fibonacci anyons , via ` galois conjugation ' .",
    "we have generalized this concept to arbitrary su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theories .    to characterize the collective states formed by a set of anyons in the presence of pairwise interactions , we have considered one - dimensional models of interacting yang - lee anyons similar to the golden chain model of the unitary case @xcite .",
    "analogous to the case of interacting fibonacci anyons , the collective states of such chains of yang - lee anyons are found to be critical and the gapless theories are described by certain non - unitary conformal field theories ( which depend on the sign of the coupling , see table [ tab : chainresults ] ) .",
    "the non - unitary chain models are found to exhibit rather peculiar features related to the presence of a non - local , topological symmetry first observed in the unitary models .",
    "for the multicritical gapless theories of these chain models this topological symmetry , whose related symmetry operator commutes with the hamiltonian , allows to classify all operators by a topology symmetry sector .",
    "it turns out that all relevant operators corresponding to ( uniform ) perturbations of the gapless system are in a different symmetry sector from the one of the ground state . in the unitary case , this mechanism which effectively protects",
    "the gapless ground state from local perturbations has led to an interpretation @xcite of these gapless modes of a chain of interacting anyons as _ edge states _ of the parent topological liquid of which the anyons are excitations of .",
    "this has further led to the conclusion that interactions between anyons ( in two - dimensional arrangements ) result in a splitting of the macroscopic degeneracy of a set of non - abelian anyons and the nucleation of a new topological liquid inside and spatially separated from the parent liquid of which the anyons are excitations @xcite .    for the non - unitary models , studied in this manuscript ,",
    "a crucial distinction comes in the symmetry sector assigned to the ground state .",
    "while in the unitary case , the ground state was found to be in the flux - free ( topological trivial ) sector , we find that the ground state in the non - unitary case exhibits a non - trivial topological flux ( i.e. is in the non - trivial topological symmetry sector ) .",
    "it remains an open question whether such a spontaneous creation of topological flux can occur in the ground state of a system of interacting anyonic quasiparticles residing in a bulk - gapped topological liquid , which has no topological flux associated with it .",
    "this may be an indication that the non - unitary anyons are not massive quasiparticles of a gapped quantum liquid , but in fact excitations of a gapless quantum liquid .    in summary ,",
    "we have investigated one - dimensional models of non - unitary anyons based on su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theories .",
    "the collective ground states are found to display critical behavior , similar to their unitary counterparts to which they are related via a ` galois conjugation ' .",
    "we described in detail the non - unitary conformal field theories capturing their critical behavior and commented on possible physical implications of our results in connection with proposed quantum hall states related to such non - unitary cfts .",

    "in this section , we will describe in some detail the structure of the descendant fields present in the numerically obtained spectra . in the case of the yang - lee ladders ,",
    "this structure is somewhat different from the ` usual ' structure .",
    "the object containing the information about the number of states at a specific energy and momentum ( in the thermodynamic limit ) is the partition function , which we will denote by @xmath315 .",
    "modular invariance of the partition function on the torus constraints the possible partition functions of rational conformal field theories at a particular central charge @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will only be concerned with the partition functions of minimal models , which are described in terms of the chiral characters associated to the primary fields .",
    "an explicit expression for these chiral characters associated to the primary fields @xmath316 of the minimal models @xmath317 is given in , for instance , chapter 8 of reference .",
    "dropping the labels @xmath321 , all the possible partition functions can be written as @xmath322 for the minimal models , there is always the so - called ` diagonal modular invariant ' , for which @xmath323 is diagonal , @xmath324 , and the sum in the partition function runs over all primary fields .",
    "however , in general , there exist other modular invariant partition functions .",
    "the critical points of the ladder models realize some of these , as we pointed out in the main text .    in terms of the virasoro generators @xmath325 and @xmath326 ,",
    "the hamiltonian and momentum operators can be written ( after an appropriate rescaling and shift ) as @xmath327 and @xmath328 .",
    "the partition function can be written as a trace over the hilbertspace , @xmath329 , which allows us to extract both the energies and momenta for each state .",
    "in particular , the energy of a state is given by the sum of the powers of @xmath36 and @xmath330 .",
    "we note that this energy is measured with respect to the energy corresponding to the energy of the identity operator @xmath331 , which we have set to zero .",
    "in addition , the momenta of a state is given by @xmath332 , in units of @xmath333 , and measured with respect to the momenta of the corresponding primary field , which is not determined by conformal field theory , but rather by the specific hamiltonian realization .",
    "the critical theory describing the ferromagnetic yang - lee ladder is the @xmath334 modular invariant @xmath260 .",
    "the total partition function of this theory can be written as follows@xcite ( we will drop the labels @xmath335 from the characters for convenience ) @xmath336    by expanding the partition function , in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath330 , we can completely explain the low - lying part of the spectrum displayed in figure [ fig : fm - doubledchain ] .",
    "let us start with the vacuum sector of the theory , which corresponds to the part of the partition function with integer powers of @xmath36 and @xmath330 : @xmath337 the total power of @xmath36 and @xmath330 gives the energy of the states , while the difference between the powers gives the momentum .",
    "thus , the character of the vacuum sector implies the presence of two states at energy @xmath338 and @xmath339 as well as two states at energy @xmath338 and momentum @xmath340 .",
    "note that we count the states irrespective of their @xmath341 sector .",
    "we will continue with the descendants corresponding to the primary field with energy @xmath342 and momentum @xmath343 . at this energy and momentum , there are in fact two states .",
    "this sector of the partition function reads @xmath344 which implies two states at @xmath345 and two at @xmath346 , as well as two states at @xmath347 and four at both @xmath348 and @xmath349 , all of which is reproduced ( modulo finite size effects ) in the spectrum in figure [ fig : fm - doubledchain ] .",
    "finally , we consider the descendants corresponding to the primary field at @xmath350 , which also has momentum @xmath343 .",
    "this sector of the partition function reads @xmath351 this implies the presence of two states at both @xmath352 and @xmath353 , as well as three states at both @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "in addition , there should be four states at @xmath356 .",
    "this seems to be at odds with the figure [ fig : fm - doubledchain ] , but it turns out that the state at @xmath343 and @xmath357 , and energy of approximately @xmath358 ( or , more precisely , @xmath359 ) is in fact doubly degenerate , so indeed , there are four states , as expected from the partition function",
    ".      a similar analysis can be performed for the antiferromagnetic critical point of the yang - lee ladder .",
    "we will be brief here , because the analysis is identical to the one for the ferromagnetic critical point .",
    "there are nine sectors in this particular case , corresponding to the fields displayed in table [ tab : kacm710310dinv ] , so the partition function can be written as @xmath360 although we will not consider all of these sectors ( some give rise to states which are too high in energy to be unambiguously identified , due to finite size effects ) , we will nevertheless give the form of the partition function restricted to each of these sectors .",
    "we will drop the labels @xmath361 from the characters @xmath362          after having dealt with the ( anti)ferromagnetic yang - lee ladders in quite some detail , we will content ourselves here by giving the ( diagonal ) partition functions describing the spectra , and note that for all states where finite size effects allow us to make an identification , we obtain full agreement with the cft prediction .    the partition function in case of the ferromagnetic yang - lee chain , the critical model is given by the diagonal invariant of the model @xmath104 , whose partition function reads ( dropping the label @xmath364 on the chiral character ) @xmath365 with @xmath366 all these states , and in fact quite a few more which we did not give here , are reproduced in the spectrum of the ferromagnetic yang - lee chain , as shown in figure [ fig : fm - chain ]",
    ".      finally , we deal with the antiferromagnetic yang - lee chain , the critical behavior of which is described by the ( diagonal invariant of the ) minimal model @xmath103 , which has four primary fields , as described in the main text .",
    "the relevant partition function is given by ( again , dropping the labels @xmath367 on the chiral characters ) @xmath368 with @xmath369 we should note that , as can be seen in figure [ fig : afm - chain ] , these fields are reproduced , and that ( for @xmath370 sites ) , the fields with conformal dimension @xmath371 and @xmath372 occur at momentum @xmath343 , while the identity fields and the field with conformal dimension @xmath373 occur at momentum @xmath374 .",
