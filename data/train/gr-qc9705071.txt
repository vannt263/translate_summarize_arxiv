    "the collision of black holes is of great interest as both astrophysics and as a strong - field gravitational interaction with no newtonian analog .",
    "black hole collisions also may provide the strongest , most observable , source of gravitational radiation that can be detected by gravitational wave observatories now under construction@xcite .",
    "the strong field nature of the process means that the nonlinear character of einstein s theory plays a crucial role , so that estimates based on linearized theory are unreliable . for the last stage of coalescence of two rotating holes in a decaying orbit",
    ", we have only dimensional estimates .",
    "the timeliness of the problem has given rise to an effort to attack the problem by solving einstein s equations numerically on supercomputers@xcite .",
    "the numerical solution starts with some `` initial value '' data , a solution of a subset of einstein s equations on an initial hypersurface , and then evolves this solution forward in time .",
    "the specification of the initial data is tantamount to specifying what problem it is that the computer will be solving , so the initial data must encode the physical parameters ( mass , spin , location , momentum ) of the colliding objects .",
    "these physical parameters are meaningful and well understood for isolated holes , but become increasingly ambiguous as the initial separation between the holes decreases , and the field of each hole has a strong effect on the spacetime geometry of the other .",
    "ultimately , at sufficiently small initial separation , it becomes impossible to make any clear statements about the physical parameters of an individual hole .    in principle , one would like to avoid this difficulty by specifying initial data on a hypersurface in the distant past when the holes were separated by a distance many times the horizon size .",
    "when the initial influence of each hole on the other becomes small , the uncertainties in the choice of initial data become negligible .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to start the numerical evolution a long time before the collision .",
    "einstein s equations are a nonlinear hyperbolic system , and for such systems instabilities in numerical evolution seem to be a generic feature . while it can be expected that some progress will be made in improving the codes and suppressing the instabilities , it is not likely that in the near future these codes will be able to evolve initial data for more than a few dynamical times , the characteristic time scale for black hole processes ( around @xmath1sec for a solar mass hole ) .",
    "this limitation precludes starting the dynamics with the holes at large distances and means that the initial data must be given on a hypersurface on which the hole - hole interactions are already strong .",
    "if the resulting numerical evolutions are to be astrophysically meaningful , it is crucial to have a way of connecting data on this `` late '' hypersurface to an astrophysical precursor configuration with the holes interacting weakly . in other words , to understand the meaning of initial data on a `` late '' hypersurface , we must know where that data came from .",
    "one approach to providing this connection is to use approximations such as higher - order post - newtonian methods in order to understand the evolution of the system from an early stage to a stage at which the holes are interacting with intermediate strength .",
    "such an approach may turn out to be sufficient if the numerical evolutions can be stabilized for a relatively long time .",
    "there is reason to hope that it might be possible to give initial data at late times , with relatively little difficulty . the reason is based on the success of a `` two phase '' approximation method used by abrahams and cook@xcite and further investigated by baker and li@xcite .",
    "these studies dealt with the head on ( zero angular momentum ) collisions of two equal - mass nonrotating holes .",
    "data were specified on a very late hypersurface , simply by using a `` standard '' initial value solution formally representing equal mass holes moving towards each other .",
    "this standard solution contained a parameter @xmath2 which , in the case of an isolated hole , agreed with the momentum of the hole .",
    "on the very late hypersurface the separation and momentum were set at the values dictated by newtonian gravity theory if the holes had started infall from some large initial separation .",
    "the standard initial value data was evolved forward in time ( with the use of an approximation method ) . the radiated energy found by this approximation",
    "could be compared with the `` correct '' radiated energy , since numerical relativity results were available for such collisions .",
    "the approximation method agreed with numerical relativity to rather good accuracy .",
    "this is somewhat a surprise since the `` standard '' numerical relativity initial data should be very different from the `` correct '' evolved data .",
    "the implication of this agreement is that results for gravitational radiation might not be sensitive to all details of initial data .",
    "we explore this question in the present paper by comparing prescriptions for imposing data on hypersurfaces with the `` correct '' data evolved from an earlier configuration . in order to do this , of course",
    ", we need the ability to evolve a solution for a relatively long time , something that can not yet be done with the nonlinear einstein equations .",
    "we choose therefore to use the particle approximation , the approximation in which the mass @xmath3 one of our holes , is much smaller than the mass of the other @xmath4 .",
    "we then treat the low - mass hole as a particle of negligible size , and we treat @xmath5 as an expansion parameter . by doing first - order perturbation theory with this parameter ,",
    "our evolution equations become linear , so that a stable numerical scheme is straightforward to develop .    in an earlier paper@xcite ( paper i )",
    ", we developed the basic mathematics of the particle limit approximation , and of evolving data that was initially stationary . in that paper ,",
    "laplace transform methods were used .",
    "the method for the present results is a direct numerical solution of the partial differential equations in radius and time ( after multipole decomposition ) .",
    "we have compared results of the two completely different methods , and found agreement within the estimated numerical accuracy , thereby adding confidence that there are no mistakes in our numerical methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give the mathematical formulation of the problem .",
    "we base this formulation on the gauge - invariant moncrief@xcite approach to perturbations , so that the variable @xmath0 we use is invariant with respect to perturbative changes in slicing .",
    "we need only specify the slicing to zero order in the perturbation , and to that order we take our hypersurfaces to be slices of constant schwarzschild time . in sec .",

    "iii , we start by explaining our numerical method for evolving @xmath0 .",
    "the scheme for solving the linear hyperbolic equation obeyed by @xmath0 is straightforward .",
    "the only issue that deserves attention is the source term in the equation for @xmath0 . in the particle limit ,",

    "the second method , due to zerilli@xcite , relies on a specific gauge , the gauge choice introduced by regge and wheeler@xcite , in which @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are set to zero .    as in paper",

    "the data , for both the initial 3-geometry and extrinsic curvature , are based on the work of york@xcite and collaborators .",

    "it follows that @xmath42 is perturbative , and hence the right hand side of ( [ genham ] ) is a higher order perturbation , which , in our first order perturbation calculation , we can ignore .",
    "we denote coordinates in the conformally related flat space with bars , such as @xmath43 , and we note that @xmath39 must be a harmonic function of these coordinates .",
    "we make two different choices for @xmath39 .",
    "the first is the solution discussed by brill and lindquist@xcite , and which we will call a bl type solution .",
    "this solution follows if we treat @xmath44 as if it were the newtonian potential of two points , one of mass @xmath4 , and one of mass @xmath45 .",
    "if the first mass is located at the origin of the flat coordinates , and the second is at ( flat ) coordinate position @xmath46 , then the bl solution takes the form @xmath47 though the origin and the point @xmath48 are coordinate singularities , they are not geometric singularities .",
    "near these coordinate points the divergence of the conformal factor means that the `` points '' are , in fact , asymptotically flat regions , so the geometry given by ( [ blphi ] ) is actually that of three asymptotically flat spaces connected by two throats . for our purposes here , we take the `` particle limit , '' the limit that @xmath49 .    the bl solution is the only choice that was considered in paper i. a second initial conformal factor that can be considered is that which is `` reflection symmetric , '' in the sense that there are only two asymptotically flat regions , and they are isometric to each other .",
    "the method of constructing such solutions was given by misner@xcite , and requires that `` image '' points be used in the conformal space , in such a way that the geometry is symmetric with respect to inversion through a sphere about each of the point singularities .",
    "here we make the solution symmetric only for a sphere about the origin .",
    "the singularity at @xmath50 , in the limit , will be taken to have a zero size inversion sphere around it ( the particle limit ) and the images inside it will be meaningless .",

    "the horizon - matched prescription is a slightly better approximation than the `` basic '' one .",
    "another way of looking at the difference between the true data and prescribed data is to investigate the effect the difference has on outgoing radiation .",
    "figures fig .",
    "[ fig : waveformaa ] ,  [ fig : waveformab ] ,   [ fig : waveformac ] show the waveforms ( that is , @xmath265 at large @xmath60 ) generated by different types of prescribed data . in each case , the solid curve , labeled @xmath266 , shows the `` true '' waveform , the waveform generated by evolution of the original , momentarily stationary data at @xmath87 .",
    "this true waveform is compared with the waveforms evolved from prescribed data placed on later hypersurfaces .",
    "the figures show that prescribed data on the @xmath267 hypersurface leads to an outgoing waveform in reasonably good agreement with the true waveform .",
    "for prescribed data on @xmath268 ( with the particle at @xmath269 , or @xmath270 ) , however , large differences are evident between waveform and the true waveform .",
    "the disagreement is less severe when the evolved data for @xmath98 is retained .",
    "an analogous comparison of waveforms is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waveformb ] for infall from @xmath248 . here",
    "the effect of prescribed data on the phase of the wave is much more evident than in the @xmath271 case .    in the work of abrahams and cook@xcite ,",
    "one of the motivations for the present work , the `` close limit '' was used to evolve prescribed data .",
    "this technique@xcite is applicable to a hypersurface at a time late enough that the colliding bodies can be considered to be inside a single nearly spherical horizon . in this technique",
    "one uses only the large-@xmath60 parts of the initial data of the colliding bodies .",
    "this technique was found to be surprisingly successful in dealing with head on collisions of equal mass holes .",
    "we saw in paper i , however , that for very unequal mass holes the close limit is valid only at extremely small separations . for comparison",
    ", we have applied the close limit to the present problem . on a sequence of hypersurfaces",
    "we replace the hypersurface data by the large-@xmath60 form of the data , and evolve the results .",
    "the resulting energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : close ] . these results , like those in paper i , show that the close - limit calculations of energy are of limited usefulness .",
    "the numerical results of the previous section give a range of comparisons between astrophysically evolved , and `` prescribed '' hypersurface data ( for quadrupole modes . )",
    "the first lesson to be learned from these results is that for the particle limit the standard prescriptions for hypersurface data are not adequate for describing an astrophysical strong gravitational field . for a particle falling from @xmath258 , for example , an approximation for the radiation using prescribed data on a late hypersurface seriously overestimates the radiated energy .",
    "figure [ fig : energybc ] shows that prescribed data for the particle at @xmath272 ( equivalent to @xmath273 ) gives a radiated energy too large by a factor of 10 . even for a hypersurface with the particle in the marginally strong field at @xmath274 ( equivalent to @xmath275 )",
    "the energy is overestimated by a factor of two .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the results of abrahams and cook@xcite for the head on collision of equal mass holes .",
    "they prescribed standard data on a late time hypersurface and found predictions of energy in excellent agreement with predictions from numerical relativity .",
    "baker and li@xcite , looking further into this problem , found that the predicted energy was remarkably insensitive to the choice of hypersurface .",
    "good predictions could be made with data specified on hypersurfaces over a fairly wide range of times .",
    "there are certain technical differences between the nature of the prescribed data we use here , and that used by abrahams and cook .",
    "in particular , they used fully symmetrized data , whereas our preferred choice of prescribed data is data that is conformally flat , longitudinal data that is frozen and matched at the horizon .",
    "this is surely not the origin of the different conclusions .",
    "for one thing switching from symmetrized hypersurface data to antisymmetrized , in numerical relativity computations , makes only a minor difference in the results .",
    "more important , the work of baker and li does not use symmetrized data , and the study by baker _",
    "et al._@xcite finds excellent results when symmetrized data is replaced by unsymmetrized approximate data . as a further check of this point ,",
    "we have redone several of our computations using symmetrized prescribed data and , as expected , found only minor differences from the results for other prescriptions .",
    "the crucial difference between the failure of prescribed data here , and its success in the previous studies , must lie in the difference between the head on collision of equal mass throats , and of a large mass throat with a small mass ( `` particle '' ) one .",
    "it is not difficult to see why this should be .",
    "it is the same reason the `` close limit '' approximation is not successful in the collision of very unequal masses .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : close ] and paper i. ) for the collision of equal masses , a common horizon engulfs both colliding throats as they begin to get into each other s strong field influence . the generation of the large amplitude gravitational waves ( i.e. , the excitation of quasinormal ringing ) more - or - less coincides with the disappearance of the individual throats inside a single connected horizon . for a hypersurface corresponding to both throats inside a single horizon , it is plausible ( and is found to be valid by the success of the calculations ) that details of the geometry near the throats is not important since they can not influence the region exterior to the horizon . for a collision of high and low mass throats",
    "the situation is very different .",
    "strong radiation is generated when the particle is near a coordinate distance @xmath276 , near the peak of the zerilli potential .",
    "for our @xmath99constant slicing this corresponds to a hypersurface for which there is no common horizon , i.e. , the particle is still well outside the horizon of the background hole . for this slicing , in fact",
    ", the particle _ always _ stays outside the background horizon , and the details of its local field are always in causal connection with infinity .",
    "the fault would not seem to be in the slicing .",
    "a @xmath99constant slicing was the choice in the method used by abrahams and cook@xcite and by baker and li@xcite , and is an obviously natural slicing for the particle infall problem .",
    "we conclude from these considerations that the fault lies in the nature of the prescribed data we have been using , i.e. , the standard choice of conformally flat longitudinal hypersurface data .",
    "as shown in the figures of the previous section , there is a dramatic difference between the true hypersurface data on a late hypersurface , and prescribed data .",
    "there are two strong reasons to suspect that the most important difference between true hypersurface data and any of the prescribed data is the difference in @xmath98 .",
    "first , our argument above suggests that the failure of prescribed data in the particle limit lies in the failure to describe fields near the particle . in figs .",
    "[ fig : psidotab ]  [ fig : psidotc ] , we see that there is ( at least visually ) a large difference between the true and the prescribed data close to the particle .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the constraints on conformally flat longitudinal data .",
    "the sharp variations in @xmath277 are , intuitively , features that should couple strongly to radiation .",
    "the inability of the prescribed data to model these features , must be viewed as potentially important .",
    "the second reason for focusing attention on @xmath98 is that the hypersurface data for @xmath98 appears to be much more important than that for @xmath0 .",
    "this was the conclusion in the study by baker",
    "_ et al._@xcite . in that work , which used colliding throats , and no stress energy , einstein s equations",
    "were linearized in the momentum of the throats and a clear identification could be made of how much of the radiated energy could be ascribed to the initial 3-geometry , how much to the momentum , i.e. , the initial extrinsic curvature , and how much to the interaction of the two .",
    "it was found that except for extremely small initial momentum the radiation was almost completely due to the extrinsic curvature .",
    "this was called `` momentum dominance '' by baker _",
    "_ here we can not make such a clear distinction . due to the moving particle source , treated as a stress energy contribution",
    ", we can not ascribe the radiation to the two kinds of initial data information .",
    "nevertheless , the energy results in our figs .  [ fig : energyaa ]  [ fig : energybc ] show that some other form of `` momentum dominance '' applies to the particle infall ; the energy radiated is much more sensitive to the details of the extrinsic curvature than to the details of the 3-geometry .",
    "the insights provided by the particle limit have helped to clarify what is needed in the way of hypersurface data for numerical evolution .",
    "a direct consequence of the present study is the realization that prescribed data will not work as successfully for unequal mass head on collisions as for the equal mass case . at some ratio of masses of the colliding holes the use of prescribed data on a late time",
    "hypersurface will start to give a significant overestimate of the radiated energy .",
    "we have , so far , studied only the quadrupole perturbations .",
    "higher multipole moments are less important astrophysically , and are not likely to lead to very different conclusions .",
    "the head on collision , of course , is neither astrophysically plausible , nor an interesting source of outgoing radiation .",
    "the interesting case is the last stage in the orbital decay of a binary pair of holes . for this one would like to start with astrophysically reasonable data on a `` as late as possible '' hypersurface .",
    "an understanding of how to do this for the head on case is a necessary step ( and perhaps a sufficient one ) towards an understanding of the more general problem . with that motivation",
    ", we shall , in a subsequent paper , investigate what _ can _ be done to provide good late time data .",
    "we shall , in particular , abandon the traditional choice of conformally flat , longitudinal data , and , instead , shall focus on data that gives a good description of the field near the particle .",
