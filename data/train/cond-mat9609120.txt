    "in systems at or close to a critical point the asymptotic power laws governing the behavior of thermodynamic quantities are modified in the vicinity of surfaces or other imhomogenities@xcite .",
    "the characteristic distance within which changes occur is given by the bulk correlation length @xmath8 .",
    "in general each bulk universality class splits up in several _",
    "surface universality classes _ , depending upon whether the tendency to order in the surface is smaller or larger than or the same as in the bulk . in the case of the two - dimensional ( 2-@xmath9 ) ising model in a semi - infinite geometry there exist two surface universality classes .",
    "since the boundary is one - dimensional and , thus can not become critical itself , the surface generally reduces the tendency to order .",
    "more precisely , for any positive starting value the exchange coupling between surface spins @xmath10 is driven to zero by successive renormalization - group transformations .",
    "the relevant field pertaining to the surface is the magnetic field @xmath0 , which acts on surface spins only and which for instance may take into account the influence of an adjacent noncritical medium .",
    "the two universality classes then are labelled by @xmath1 , the `` ordinary '' transition , and @xmath2 , the `` normal '' transition , where the former is a unstable fixed point and the latter is a stable fixed point of the renormalization - group flow@xcite .    in this work",
    "we are mainly concerned with order - parameter profiles for _ finite _ @xmath0 in the crossover region between the fixed points .",
    "nonetheless , let us first recapitulate the situation _ at _ the fixed points .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in the introduction our considerations remain restricted to bulk criticality @xmath11 , but the extension to the critical region is straightforward and will be done below . at the critical point and @xmath1 ,",
    "the order - parameter ( or magnetization ) profile @xmath3 is zero for any distance @xmath12 from the surface . in the other extreme , @xmath2",
    ", it is well known that at macroscopic distances from the surface the magnetization decays as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the scaling dimension of the bulk order - parameter field , with the exact value @xmath15 in the 2-@xmath9 ising model .",
    "what do we expect , when @xmath0 takes some intermediate value , i.e. , in the crossover region between the fixed points ?",
    "now , @xmath0 will certainly generate a surface magnetization @xmath7 .",
    "as far as the profile @xmath3 is concerned , a first guess would perhaps be that the magnetization should decay from that value as @xmath16 increases away from the surface .",
    "this guess is supported by mean - field theory , where one can calculate @xmath3 and indeed finds a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite the present authors have shown that , contrary to the naive ( mean - field ) expectation , fluctuations may cause the order parameter to steeply _ increase _ to values @xmath17 in a surface - near regime .",
    "the range within which this growth occurs ( at bulk criticality ) is determined by @xmath0 , the characteristic length scale being @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the scaling dimension of @xmath0 @xcite . as further demonstrated by the present authors in ref.@xcite , the growth of order in the near - surface regime @xmath20",
    "is described by a _",
    "universal _ power law @xmath21 i.e. , the growth exponent @xmath5 is governed by the difference between the scaling dimensions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 the profile has a maximum and farther away from the surface , at distances much larger than @xmath25 , the magnetization decays as @xmath26 .    largely analogous results  monotonous behavior at the fixed points and profiles with one extremum in the crossover regime  where previously found by mikheev and fisher @xcite for the _ energy density _ of the 2-@xmath9 ising model .",
    "the authors also suggested to calculate the order parameter in the crossover region .",
    "below we focus our attention exactly on this problem .",
    "the questions posed in this work are the following :    * does the short - distance growth of @xmath3 , found for instance in the three - dimensional ising model , also occur in two dimensions ? * does the simple power law ( [ power ] ) quantitatively describe the magnetization profile in @xmath27 , or are modifications to be expected ? *",
    "is the scenario for the crossover between `` ordinary '' and `` normal '' transition , developed for the three - dimensional ising model , also valid in @xmath27 ?    as we will demonstrate below , the answer to the first and third question is  yes \" , but the simple power law ( [ power ] ) is modified by a _",
    "logarithm_.    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[two ] the theoretical framework is expounded .",
    "we first summarize the results of ref.@xcite and then generalize the scaling analysis by taking into account the available exact results on the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath0 and on the magnetization profile . in sec.[three ] , in order to corroborate our analytical findings , we present monte carlo ( mc ) data for @xmath3 and compare with exact results for the order - parameter profile . in two appendices exact literature results on the dependence of the surface magnetization on @xmath0 and on the order - parameter profile are briefly reviewed .",
    "we consider the semi - infinite ising system with a free boundary on a plane square lattice . the exchange coupling between neighboring spins is @xmath28 .",
    "a surface magnetic field @xmath29 is imposed on the boundary spins and bulk magnetic fields are set to zero such that the hamiltonian of the model reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the boundary and the whole system ( including the boundary ) , respectively . as usual , we work with the dimensionless variables @xmath33 the bulk critical point corresponds to @xmath34 .      in the critical regime , where @xmath36 , thermodynamic quantities are described by homogeneous functions of the scaling fields .",
    "as a consequence , the behavior of the local magnetization under rescaling of distances should be described by @xmath37 where @xmath14 and @xmath19 is the scaling dimension of @xmath0 @xcite . in terms of other surface exponents",
    "we have @xmath38@xcite . in eq.([scal ] ) it was further assumed that the distance @xmath16 from the surface is much larger than the lattice spacing or any other",
    "_ microscopic _ length scale .",
    "one is interested in the behavior at _ macroscopic _ scales , and , for the present , @xmath16 may be considered as a continuous variable ranging from zero to infinity .    removing the arbitrary rescaling parameter @xmath39 in eq.([scal ] ) by setting it @xmath40 , one obtains the scaling form of the magnetization    [ scal2 ] @xmath41 where , as already stated",
    ", @xmath42    is the length scale set by the surface field .",
    "the second length scale pertinent to the semi - infinite system and occurring in ( [ scalm ] ) is the bulk correlation length @xmath43 . regarding the interpretation of mc data , which are normally obtained from finite lattices , one has to take into account a third length scale , the characteristic dimension @xmath44 of the system , and a finite - size scaling analysis has to be performed .",
    "the latter will be briefly described in sec.[twothree ] .",
    "going back to the semi - infinite case and setting @xmath45 , the only remaining length scale is @xmath46 , and the order - parameter profile can be written in the critical - point scaling form @xmath47 as said above , for @xmath48 the magnetization decays as @xmath49 and , thus , @xmath50 should approach a constant for @xmath51 . in order to work out the _ short - distance _ behavior of the scaling function @xmath50",
    ", we demand that @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "this means that in general , in terms of macroscopic quantities , the boundary value of @xmath3 is _ not _ @xmath7 .",
    "if the @xmath16-dependence of @xmath3 is described by a power law , it can not approach any value different from zero or infinity as @xmath16 goes to zero .",
    "however , the somewhat weaker relation symbolized by `` @xmath54 '' should hold , stating that the respective quantity asymptotically ( up to constants )  behaves as \" or  is proportional to \" .",
    "this is in accord with and actually motivated by the field - theoretic short - distance expansion @xcite , where operators near a boundary are represented in terms of boundary operators multiplied by @xmath55-number functions .    in the case of the three - dimensional ising model the foregoing discussion leads to the conclusion that @xmath56 because the `` ordinary '' surface  the universality class to which also a free surface belongs  is paramagnetic and responds linearly to a small magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the consequence for the scaling function in ( [ h1 ] ) is that @xmath57 , and , inserting this in ( [ h1 ] ) , we obtain that the exponent governing the short - distance behavior of @xmath3 is given by the difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( as already stated in eq.([power ] ) ) . using the scaling relation @xmath58 @xcite among anomalous dimensions",
    ", one can reexpress the exponent @xmath5 as @xcite @xmath59 in the mean field approximation the value of @xmath5 is zero , and one really has @xmath60 .",
    "however , a positive value is obtained when fluctuations are taken into account below the upper critical dimensionality @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , the result for the @xmath62-vector model with @xmath63 ( belonging to the ising universality class ) in the framework of the @xmath64-expansion is @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "thus , the magnetization indeed grows as @xmath16 increases away from the surface .    for the 2-@xmath9 ising model the exponent @xmath66",
    "is known _ exactly _ @xcite and one obtains @xmath67 .",
    "however , as will be discussed in sec.[twotwo ] , the pure power law found in ref.@xcite for @xmath68 is modified in two dimensions by a _ logarithmic _",
    "term , and the exponent @xmath6 can not directly be seen in the profile .",
    "the above phenomenological analysis is straightforwardly extended to the case @xmath69 . in @xmath70",
    ", we may assume that the behavior near the surface for @xmath71 is unchanged compared to ( [ power ] ) , and , thus , the increasing profiles are also expected slightly above the critical temperature .",
    "the behavior farther away from the surface depends on the ratio @xmath72 . in the case of @xmath73",
    "a crossover to an exponential decay will take place for @xmath74 and the regime of nonlinear decay does not occur . for @xmath75 a crossover to the power - law decay @xmath76 takes place and finally at @xmath74 the exponential behavior sets in .    below the critical temperature",
    ", the short - distance behavior of the order parameter is also described by a power law , this time governed by a different exponent , however .",
    "the essential point is that below @xmath77 the surface orders even for @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in the scaling analysis the scaling dimension of @xmath0 has to be replaced by the scaling dimension of @xmath7 , the conjugate density to @xmath0 , given by @xmath78@xcite .",
    "the exponent that describes the increase of the profile is thus @xmath79 @xcite , a number that even in mean - field theory is different from zero ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "phenomena to some extent analogous to the ones discussed above were reported for the crossover between _ special _ and normal transition@xcite .",
    "also near the special transition the surface field @xmath0 gives rise to a length scale .",
    "however , the respective exponent , the analogy to @xmath5 in ( [ power ] ) , is negative , and , thus , one finds a profile that monotonously decays for all ( macroscopic ) @xmath16 , with different power laws in the short - distance and the long - distance regime and a crossover at distances comparable to the length scale set by @xmath0 .",
    "however , _",
    "non - monotonous _ behavior in the crossover region is a common feature in the case of the energy density in @xmath27 @xcite and as well as in higher dimensionality@xcite .",
    "the _ spatial _ variation of the magnetization discussed so far strongly resembles the _ time _ dependence of the magnetization in relaxational processes at the critical point .",
    "if a system with nonconserved order parameter ( model a ) is quenched from a high - temperature initial state to the critical point , with a small initial magnetization @xmath81 , the order parameter behaves as @xmath82 @xcite , where the short - time exponent @xmath83 is governed by the difference between the scaling dimensions of initial and equilibrium magnetization divided by the dynamic ( equilibrium ) exponent@xcite .",
    "like the exponent @xmath5 in ( [ power ] ) , the exponent @xmath83 vanishes in mf theory , but becomes positive below @xmath61 .",
    "during the years , initiated by the work of mccoy and wu@xcite , the 2-@xmath9 ising model with a surface magnetic field received a great deal of attention , because many aspects can be treated exactly and it is a simple special version of the 2-@xmath9 ising model in a inhomogeneous bulk field , a problem to which an exact solution would be highly desirable .",
    "some of these exact results , namely those considering the vicinity of the critical point @xcite , will be used in the following as a guiding line for our phenomenological scaling analysis and to compare numerical data with .",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 on the surface magnetic field ( bulk field @xmath84 ) in the 2-@xmath9 ising model was calculated exactly by au - yang and fisher @xcite in a @xmath85 ( strip ) geometry .",
    "the limit @xmath86 , yielding results for the semi - infinite geometry , was also considered . whereas above two dimensions at the ordinary transition the surface , in a sense , is paramagnetic , i.e. , the response of @xmath7 to a small @xmath0 is linear , in two dimensions the function @xmath87 has a more complicated form .",
    "as summarized in appendix a ( see eq.([m1h1 ] ) ) , there is a logarithmic correction to the linear term in @xmath27 ; for @xmath88 the surface magnetization behaves as @xmath89 .",
    "further , as shown by bariev @xcite and summarized in appendix b , the length scale @xmath46 determined by @xmath0 behaves as @xmath90^{-2}$ ] . for small @xmath0 , where the scaling analysis is expected to be correct ,",
    "this is consistent with ( [ length ] ) as @xmath91 in the 2-@xmath9 ising model .",
    "thus the characteristic length scale that enters the scaling analysis depends in the same way upon @xmath0 as in higher dimensions .    the foregoing discussion allows us to generalize our scaling analysis , especially eqs.([h1 ] ) and the near - surface law ( [ power ] ) , such that the speacial features of the 2-@xmath9 ising model are taken into account .",
    "again , the only available length scale at @xmath45 is @xmath46 , and the magnetization can be represented in the form given in eq.([h1 ] ) . for @xmath48",
    "we expect that @xmath92 and , thus , @xmath50 should approach a constant for @xmath51 . in order to find the short - distance behavior we assume again that @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "taking into account the logarithmic correction mentioned above and discussed in more detail in appendix a ( see eq.([m1h1 ] ) , we find that @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "hence , for the short - distance behavior of @xmath3 in the semi - infinite system we obtain @xmath95 where the exact values of the exponents are @xmath96 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus , for @xmath97 the magnetization @xmath3 for a given value of @xmath0 behaves as @xmath98 .    the result ( [ sdbe ] ) should hold for any value of the exchange coupling @xmath10 in the surface . in our mc analyses to be presented below we implemented free boundary conditions with @xmath99 , but we expect ( [ sdbe ] ) to hold for any value of @xmath10 with possible @xmath10-dependent nonuniversal constants leaving the qualitative behavior of the profiles unchanged .",
    "eq.([sdbe ] ) is the main analytic result of this work . as discussed in the following ,",
    "it is consistent with bariev s exact solution@xcite ( see appendix b ) and with mc data for the profile .",
    "it tells us that the short - distance power law behavior is modified by a logarithmic term .",
    "this logarithm can be traced back to the logarithmic singularity of the surface susceptibility@xcite , which , in turn , causes the logarithmic dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath0 , and eventually leaves its fingerprint also on the near - surface behavior of the magnetization .",
    "the result ( [ sdbe ] ) provides a thorough understanding of the near - surface behavior of the order parameter and allows to relate special features of the two - dimensional system , which were ( as we will discuss in more detail below ) previously known from the exact analyses @xcite , to the somewhat simpler short - distance law in higher dimensions .      in order to assess the finite size effects to be expected in the mc simulations",
    ", we have to take into account the finite - size length scale @xmath44 , which is proportional to the linear extension @xmath100 of the lattice ( compare sec.[threeone ] below ) .",
    "the generalization of ( [ scal ] ) reads@xcite @xmath101 and proceeding as before , we obtain as the generalization of ( [ scalm ] ) to a system of finite size : @xmath102 thus even at @xmath77 there are two pertinent length scales , on the one hand @xmath44 ( imposed by the geometry that limits the wavelength of fluctuations ) and on the other hand @xmath46 ( the scale set by @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is well known that for large @xmath103 we have to expect an exponential decay of @xmath3 on the scale @xmath44 . in the opposite limit , when @xmath16 is smaller than both @xmath44 and @xmath46 , we expect the short - distance behavior ( [ sdbe ] ) to occur . however , for @xmath27 it can be concluded from the finite - size result ( [ m1h1fin ] ) that there will be an @xmath44-dependent amplitude , a prefactor to the function given in ( [ sdbe ] ) . but otherwise the logarithmically modified power law ( [ sdbe ] ) should occur . farther away from the surface ,",
    "the form of the profile depends on the ratio between @xmath46 and @xmath44 . for @xmath16",
    "smaller than both @xmath44 and @xmath46 , the behavior is described by ( [ sdbe ] ) . in the case of @xmath104",
    "a crossover to an exponential decay will take place for @xmath105 . in the opposite case ,",
    "a crossover to the power - law decay @xmath13 takes place , followed by the crossover to the exponential behavior at @xmath105 .",
    "thus , qualitatively , the discussion is completely analogous to the one in sec.[twoone ] , where the behavior at finite @xmath8 was described .",
    "the results of the scaling analysis , especially the short - distance law ( [ sdbe ] ) , were checked by mc simulations . to this end , we calculated order - parameter profiles for the 2-@xmath9 ising model with uniform exchange coupling @xmath28 .",
    "the geometry of our systems was that of a rectangular ( square ) lattice with two free boundaries ( opposite to each other ) and the other boundaries periodically coupled , such that the effective geometry was that of a cylinder of finite length .",
    "the linear dimension perpendicular to the free surfaces was taken to be four times larger than the lateral extension in order to keep corrections due to the second surface small@xcite .",
    "hence , when we talk about a lattice of size @xmath100 in the following , we refer to a rectangular @xmath106 system .    in order to generate an equilibrium sample of spin configurations",
    ", we used the swendson - wang algorithm@xcite .",
    "it effectively avoids critical slowing down by generating new spin configurations via clusters of bonds , whereby the law of detailed balance is obeyed . for a given spin configuration , a bond between two neighboring spins of _ equal _ sign exits with probability @xmath107 .",
    "there are no bonds between _ opposite _ spins .",
    "then , clusters are defined as any connected configuration of bonds .",
    "also isolated spins define a cluster , such that eventually each spin belongs to one of the clusters . after having identified the clusters , the new configuration is generated by assigning to each cluster of spins a new orientation , with equal probability for each spin value as long as the cluster does _",
    "not _ extend to a surface .    in order to take into account @xmath0",
    ", we introduced , in the same way as suggested by wang for taking into account bulk fields @xcite , two `` ghost '' layers of spins next to each surface that couple to the surface spins with coupling strength @xmath0 and that all point in the direction of @xmath0 .",
    "if at least one bond between a surface and a ghost spin exists the cluster has to keep its old spin when the system is updated .",
    "this preserves detailed balance . in the practical calculation",
    "this rule was realized by a modified ( reduced ) spin - flip probability @xmath108 for clusters pointing in the direction of @xmath0 ( and @xmath109 for clusters pointing in opposite direction ) , @xmath110 being the number of _ surface _ spins contained in the cluster .    in order to obtain an equilibrium distribution of configurations we discharged several hundred ( depending on system size ) configurations after the start of the simulation . to keep memory consume low , we used multispin - coding techniques , i.e.",
    ", groups of 64 spins were coded in one long integer .",
    "a crucial test for the mc program is the comparison with known exact results . on the other hand , if both mc data an exact results agree , the former can be regarded also as a confirmation of the exact results .",
