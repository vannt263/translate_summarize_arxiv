    "the use of chiral lagrangians in combination with unitary techniques in coupled channels of mesons and baryons has been a very fruitful scheme to study the nature of many hadron resonances .",
    "the poles found in the analysis of meson baryon scattering amplitudes are identified with existing baryon resonances . in this way",
    "the interaction of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons with the octet of stable baryons has lead to @xmath7 resonances which fit quite well the spectrum of the known low lying resonances with these quantum number  @xcite .",
    "the combination of pseudoscalars with the decuplet of baryons has also received attention and also leads to several dynamically generated states  @xcite .",
    "work substituting pseudoscalar mesons with vector mesons has also been done recently leading to new resonances dynamically generated  @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting findings in the study of the interaction of pseudoscalars with the octet of baryons is the generation of the @xmath8 resonance which has large couplings to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , to the point that the resonance can be approximately considered as a bound state of these meson baryon components  @xcite .",
    "another point of view is that this resonance can be considered as a hidden strangeness state .",
    "in fact , phenomenological studies show that , indeed , this seems to be the case  @xcite .",
    "the idea that we want to explore here is to see if one can also generate dynamically baryon states in the hidden charm sector .",
    "the interaction of charmed mesons with the octet of stable baryons has been studied in @xcite and further refined in @xcite .",
    "several states with open charm are dynamically generated there , in particular the @xmath11 .    in the present work",
    "we follow the steps of @xcite but concentrate in states of hidden charm , for which we study the interaction of an anticharmed meson with a charmed baryon . the underlying theory that we use",
    "is an extension to su(4 ) of the local hidden gauge lagrangians @xcite , where su(4 ) is broken to account for the different masses of the vector mesons exchanged in the t- and u- channels .",
    "the study is done both with pseudoscalar mesons and vector mesons and we obtain three dynamically generated hidden charm baryons generated from the pseudoscalar baryon interaction plus three other states from the interaction of vector mesons with baryons , all of them with masses around 4200 - 4600 mev .",
    "we also make estimates of production cross sections with @xmath12 collisions that could be carried out at the future fair facility within the panda project .",
    "we also study how the presence of these resonances could increase the rate of @xmath13 and @xmath14 production around the energies where the resonances can be formed .",
    "part of our results have been briefly reported in @xcite , here we give a much more complete report of our investigation .    in the next section",
    ", we present the formalism and ingredients for the study of the interaction , and give the poles obtained . in the last section ,",

    "yet , this requires a certain phase convention for the physical states with respect to the isospin states implicit in the su(4 ) tables , which makes convenient to use the same procedure to evaluate the @xmath66 vertex .    in the @xmath66 vertex we go from the @xmath67 representation of pseudoscalars to the @xmath68 representation of vectors .",

    "when we choose @xmath146 or @xmath145 , the shapes of these two functions are almost the same close to threshold and they take the same value at threshold .    then we can get the unitary t amplitudes by solving the coupled channels bethe - salpeter equation in the on shell factorization approach of @xcite @xmath147^{-1}v\\ .\\label{bethe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when we look for poles in the complex plane of @xmath148 , poles in the @xmath134 matrix that appear in the first riemann sheet below threshold are considered as bound states whereas those located in the second riemann sheet and above the threshold of some channel are identified as resonances .      from the @xmath134 matrix we can find the pole positions @xmath149 . in this work",
    ", we find all of these poles in the real axes below threshold , in a few words , they are bound states . in view of that , for these cases the coupling constants are obtained from the amplitudes in the real axis .",
    "these amplitudes behave close to the pole as : @xmath150 we can get the coupling constant as : @xmath151 this expression allows us to determine the value of @xmath152 , except by a global phase .",
    "then , the other couplings are derived from @xmath153    as all the states that we find have zero width , we should take into account some decay mechanisms .",
    "thus , we consider the decay of the states to light meson - light baryon by means of box diagrams as it was done in @xcite .",
    "the feynman diagrams for these decays are shown in fig .",
    "we assume that @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are on - shell and neglect the three - momentum of the initial and final particles .",

    "( [ widpb ] ) we have factorized the two @xmath174 and @xmath175 transition amplitudes outside the loop integral by taking their values when the system @xmath176 is set on - shell .",
    "this is a good approximation , exact for the imaginary part of the diagram , which is our main concern , since we are interested in the contribution of these diagrams to the width of the resonances .",
    "the loop integral only affects then the @xmath177 , @xmath178 propagators leading to the same @xmath133 function defined in eq .",
    "( [ gf ] ) .",
    "since the on - shell mass of the intermediate states is far away from the energies investigated , @xmath179 is small and we have checked that it is sufficiently smaller than the tree level contribution from the diagrams of fig .",
    "( [ fe ] ) , such that it can be ignored .",
    "for example , @xmath180  gev@xmath181 at the @xmath4 pole position with @xmath182 gev .    , @xmath17 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the same particles than in fig .",
    "@xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are light particles belonging to the su(3 ) octet of pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons and stable baryons , respectively , and @xmath183 , @xmath184 are @xmath185 or @xmath186 . ]    further on , we will include the @xmath187 , @xmath188 channels for @xmath189 , and @xmath190 , @xmath191 for @xmath192 in the calculation .",
    "once the formalism has been exposed we would like to make some comments to justify the approach . while the hidden local gauge approach is well settled with su(3 )",
    "flavor , its extension to su(4 ) is not quite justified . the local hidden gauge theory in qcd",
    "is based on spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetry , which is not expected to hold in the charmed sector , and even if this were the case , the breaking pattern would be masked by the large charm mass . in view of this , the approach followed requires some justification .",
    "the first thing we must bare in mind is that the large mass of the charmed quark is to be blamed for the lack of symmetry .",
    "hence , if hadron dynamics still has some traces of su(4 ) symmetry it should be in particular vertices or amplitudes not tied to the quark mass . in this respect it is interesting to mention that su(4 ) symmetry works fairly well for the vertices vp@xmath193 ( or equivalently the vvp ) involved in the radiative decay of vector mesons with charm to a pseudoscalar and a photon @xcite .",
    "the agreement is as good as in su(3 ) . given the analogies between the vvp and vvv vertices provided by heavy quark symmetry , it is fair to think that using su(4 ) symmetry to evaluate the vvv and vpp vertices would be a fair starting point .",
    "similarly we could also assume the same symmetry to hold in the vbb vertices .",
    "one should also note that in the case of meson meson interaction the present approach provides the same results , up to a mass term of no practical consequences , as the heavy quark formalism used in @xcite for the case of interaction of light mesons with heavy meson . from the perspective of our approach",
    ", we could rephrase it by stating that these two approaches provide the same vvv ( or vpp ) vertices with two heavy vectors and a light one .",
    "for the evaluation of the width in the present approach one is using these vertices , with the only difference with respect to @xcite that one of the heavy vectors is exchanged in the @xmath194channel in our approach , while the two heavy vectors ( or pseudoscalars ) were external particles in @xcite . only vertices involving three heavy vectors ( @xmath195 ) would require the extra help of su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "thus , most of the information used is supported by phenomenology and other approaches .",
    "furthermore , we should bare in mind that the largest fraction of the results that we obtain , concerning couplings to different channels , is based on su(3 ) , since we can relate these channels through su(3 ) . then , implementing su(4 ) symmetry as we do , automatically accomplishes this .",
    "only when we give a jump to another charm sector the su(4 ) symmetry would play a role and there we would invoke the arguments used above to support it .",
    "certainly , when these vertices are used in feynmann diagrams and the masses of the exchanged vectors are very different , the approximate su(4 ) symmetry that we had in the vertices will be badly broken in the amplitudes .",
    "this happens also in su(3 ) : the vertices are manifestly su(3 ) invariant , but when su(3 ) is broken in the amplitudes because of the different masses of the particles belonging to the same multiplet ( for instance in the unitarization procedure ) , the underlying su(3 ) symmetry is broken and two octets that were degenerate in the exact su(3 ) limit give rise to two different states in the strangeness @xmath196 sector : one of the two @xmath197 states and the @xmath198 .    yet , one should be ready to accept larger uncertainties than in su(3 ) and allow some fitting freedom in the approach .",
    "this can be done by means of the subtraction constants of the g function , that effectively tune the strength of the potentials that one is using in the approach .",
    "this also means that the natural values of these constants should only be used as indicative and then a real fit to the data should be done , which can not be done in the present case since we have no experimental data .",
    "however , one can rely on previous work along these lines in which several groups have done this work and provide the new scale of the subtraction constants to be used in the charm sector . in this sense , the works of @xcite , choosing these parameters to reproduce properties of known resonances like the @xmath199 , the x(3872 ) , the @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and @xmath11 , have given us the scale for these subtractions constants that we use here .",
    "here we show the results for the different sectors . by using the two @xmath133 functions of eqs .",
    "( [ gf ] ) and ( [ gf2 ] ) , the poles appear in both cases below threshold in the first riemann sheet and therefore they are bound states .",
    "we show the pole positions for different values of @xmath202 in tables [ pbpole ] and [ vbpole ] .",
    "we take a range of values of @xmath203 , or accordingly the cut off , in line with values used in @xcite and we find six poles in our calculation .",
    "the uncertainties in the pole positions in the case of the first and third poles for both @xmath204 and @xmath173 systems , are of the order of @xmath205 mev , which are typical in any hadron model .",
    "these two poles are rather stable . however , for the second state , the uncertainties are much larger and the pole position is very unstable .",
