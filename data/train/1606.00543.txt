    "a lorentzian manifold @xmath3 or a spacetime is a differentiable manifold @xmath4 equipped with a lorentzian metric @xmath5 of signature @xmath6 . in general relativity ,",
    "the gravity is described by a spacetime 4-manifold @xmath3 , the lorentzian metric @xmath5 satisfies the einstein field equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy - momentum tensor due to the presence of matter or fields , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants .    in this paper , we are interested in the solutions to ( [ ee ] ) with timelike killing fields .",
    "these solutions are called stationary solutions .",
    "stationary solutions are used to model the possible time - independent limit states of a cosmological system .",
    "for instance , kerr metrics are stationary and vacuum solutions ( @xmath11 ) to ( [ ee ] ) , while schwarzschild metrics are static and vacuum solutions ( @xmath11 ) . here",
    ", static means that the spacetime has a timelike killing field whose orthogonal complement is an integrable distribution , i.e. , the timelike killing field is locally orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "these stationary solutions , including schwarzchild , kerr , reissner - nordstrom ( electrovac static ) , kerr - newmann metrics ( electrovac stationary ) , have been central to the study of the black hole spacetimes , see @xcite @xcite .    if the spacetime @xmath3 admits an isometric @xmath12-action such that the @xmath12-orbits are timelike curves , the infinitesimal generator of the @xmath12-action is a timelike killing field . in many literatures , the terminology `` stationary '' was also used to referring to the existence of such global @xmath12-action . here , our usage of `` stationary '' is in a broader sense , it only refers to the existence of a timelike killing field .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the following theorem :    [ t1.1 ] let @xmath13 be a geodesically complete spacetime of dimension 4 with a timelike killing field @xmath14 such that @xmath5 satisfies the einstein equation @xmath15 , where @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath13 is flat .    here",
    ", @xmath13 is said to be geodesically complete if the affine parameters of any @xmath16-geodesic on @xmath4 can be extended to the whole real line @xmath12 .",
    "the einstein equation satisfied by the spacetime in theorem [ t1.1 ] is equivalent to @xmath17 and @xmath18 in ( [ ee ] ) .",
    "we remark that when @xmath19 , the result of theorem [ t1.1 ] is not true .",
    "the simplest counter examples are anti - de sitter spacetimes , which are static , geodesically complete , and satisfying @xmath0 for @xmath19 .",
    "recall that a lorentzian manifold @xmath3 is said to be chronological if it contains no closed timelike curves . in @xcite",
    ", m. t. anderson proved that if the spacetime @xmath20 is geodesically complete , chronological and admits an isometric timelike @xmath12-action such that @xmath5 satisfies the vacuum einstein field equation @xmath21 , then @xmath20 must be flat .",
    "when the @xmath12-orbit space @xmath22 is an asymptotically flat 3-manifold , the result was due to a. lichnerowicz @xcite in 1955 .",
    "the previous pioneering work was due to a. einstein and a. einstein - w .",
    "pauli , see @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic flatness on the orbit space is usually a reasonable assumption for an isolated chronological physical system .",
    "the chronological condition is used to ensure that the @xmath12-orbit space @xmath22 ( denoted by @xmath23 ) is a paracompact hausdorff and smooth manifold , see @xcite .",
    "actually , in this case , the manifold @xmath4 is diffeomorphic to @xmath24 , and the metric @xmath16 has the following global form ( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) @xmath25 on @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are some function and @xmath29form on @xmath23 , @xmath30 is a riemannian metric on @xmath23 , @xmath31 is the projection map from @xmath4 to the space of @xmath12-orbits @xmath23 .",
    "the argument in @xcite used the collapsing theory(c.f.@xcite ) for a sequence of 3-riemannian manifolds which are the orbit spaces of the isometric @xmath32actions .",
    "when the orbit spaces @xmath23 are noncompact and have dimension equal to 3 , anderson @xcite argued that the collapsing can be unwrapped by considering their universal covers .",
    "recently , j. cortier and v. minerbe @xcite gave a new proof of anderson s theorem @xcite under an extra assumption on the norm of the timelike killing field @xmath14 .",
    "without chronological condition , the orbit space could be very `` bad '' .",
    "a simple compact example is minkowski flat torus @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) , here we take the constant vector field with irrational slope as a timelike killing field . in this case ,",
    "any killing orbit is dense in @xmath33 , so the quotient topology just consists of two elements : the empty set and the whole space .",
    "for noncompact examples , one can take a product of such a torus with a real line .    whether the chronological condition can be removed in anderson s theorem",
    "is a question asked in @xcite ( see @xcite  1 second paragraph ) , so theorem [ t1.1 ] answers this question affirmatively .",
    "direct generalization of theorem [ t1.1 ] to higher dimensions is not true , because we have to allow non - flat examples which are product of a ricci flat riemannian manifold with a real line .",
    "so when dimension @xmath2 , the best we can hope is a splitting result .",
    "actually , if the spacetimes are assumed to be static , we can prove that it is really the case :    [ t1.2 ] let @xmath13 be a geodesically complete spacetime of dimension @xmath34 with a timelike killing field whose orthogonal complement is integrable .",
    "suppose the metric @xmath5 satisfies the einstein equation @xmath15 , where @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath35 and the universal cover of @xmath13 is isometric to @xmath24 equipped with a product metric @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a complete ricci flat riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath38 .",
    "as we mentioned before , the result in theorem [ t1.2 ] is not true for @xmath19 .",
    "it should be noted that recently m. reiris @xcite has shown theorem [ t1.2 ] under the chronological condition .",
    "more precisely , m. reiris @xcite has obtained the same result for static solutions to einstein - scalar equation under the assumption that the spacetime splits topologically as @xmath26 and the metric has global form ( [ met ] ) with @xmath39 .",
    "theorems [ t1.1 ] and [ t1.2 ] are derived by proving a local curvature estimate or a local gradient estimate of the norm of the killing field @xmath14 .",
    "to state the result , we need to introduce a riemannian metric which is naturally associated to the stationary spacetime @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the 1-form on @xmath4 obtained from @xmath14 by lowering indices .",
    "we define @xmath42 which is a riemannian metric on @xmath4 .",
    "it can be shown that the vector field @xmath14 is still a killing field for the metric @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , one can associate a stationary riemannian metric @xmath43 to a stationary lorentzian metric @xmath5 with the same killing field .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for similar ideas in treating the injectivity radius estimate and local optimal regularity of einstein spacetimes .    our local curvature or gradient estimates are the followings :    [ t1.3]let @xmath13 be a spacetime of dimension @xmath44 with a timelike killing field @xmath14 and @xmath5 satisfies the einstein equation @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath45 be a @xmath46metric ball centered at @xmath47 of radius @xmath48 with compact closure in @xmath4 .",
    "then there is a universal constant @xmath49 such that @xmath50    [ t1.4]let @xmath13 be a spacetime of dimension @xmath34 with a timelike killing field @xmath14 whose orthogonal complement is integrable , and @xmath5 satisfies einstein equation @xmath15 . let @xmath45 be a @xmath46metric ball centered at @xmath47 of radius @xmath48 with compact closure in @xmath4 . then there is a universal constant @xmath49 such that @xmath51    note that @xmath52 if @xmath1 in theorems [ t1.3 ] and [ t1.4 ] . to prove theorems [ t1.1 ] and [ t1.2 ] from theorems [ t1.3 ] and [ t1.4 ]",
    ", we need a fact that @xmath5- geodesic completeness implies @xmath43-geodesic completeness ( see theorem [ complete ] in section 3 ) .",
    "when dimension equals to @xmath44 , actually we can show that a local curvature estimate holds on more general spacetimes which are not necessarily vacuum ( see theorems [ n ] , [ m ] ) .",
    "the result roughly says that if the energy momentum tensor is controlled , then the full curvature tensor of the spacetime can also be controlled quantitatively .",
    "the non - vacuum einstein field equation coupled with specific matter fields will be treated in forthcoming papers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we prepare some preliminary formulas that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "sections 2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3 involve many straight forward computations on the connections and curvatures , and the formulas work for stationary lorentzian and stationary riemannian manifolds . in section 3 , we prove that the @xmath16-geodesic completeness implies the @xmath43-geodesic completeness . in section 4 , we prove theorems [ t1.4 ] and [ t1.2 ] .",
