    "et al . _ 1985 ; windhorst _ et al . _ 1985 ; thuan & condon 1987 ) and spectroscopic studies ( benn _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) reveal that the sources responsible for the flattening are predominantly star - forming galaxies , similar to those of the iras starburst population .",
    "the proportion of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is much smaller than it is at higher flux densities ( benn _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; gruppioni _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; kron _",
    "et al . _ 1985 ) .",
    "however , the local density of star - forming radio sources is too small to explain the turn - up point and slope of the @xmath16 curve .",
    "moreover , evolutionary models of the radio sources that dominate the counts at high flux densities can not reproduce these features either ( danese _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ; danese , de zotti & franceschini 1985 ) .",
    "therefore , models for the source counts invoke strong evolution of either spiral galaxies ( condon 1989 ; dunlop & peacock 1990 ) , or star - forming iras population galaxies ( danese _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ; rowan - robinson _",
    "_ 1993 ; hopkins _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .    visual inspection of faint radio sources shows that many have optical counterparts which are preferentially located in pairs or small groups exhibiting disturbed optical morphologies , suggestive of interactions or mergers ( kron _ et al . _",
    "1985 ; gruppioni _ et al .",
    "although this method is not an ideal way to identify physically associated groups , the frequency of cases suggests that such phenomena are partially responsible for the enhanced star formation rate seen in these objects ( kron _ et al . _ 1985 ; windhorst _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "further evidence for the appearance of a new population at faint radio flux densities comes from measurements of angular sizes .",
    "these show that at flux densities below a few mjy , the median angular size drops abruptly to few arcseconds ( coleman & condon 1985 ; oort _ et al .",
    "this can be reconciled if faint radio sources are associated with spiral galaxies with radio morphology more compact than that of ellipticals which dominate at higher flux densities ( coleman & condon 1985 ) .    despite the effort devoted to the study of the faint radio population",
    "there is still no clear answer to the following questions : ( i ) what is the stellar population in sub - mjy radio sources and how do they evolve with redshift , ( ii ) what is their relation to the local population of normal galaxies and ( iii ) how are the star - formation activity and radio properties of these objects related . to address these points we present a deep and homogeneous radio ( 1.4ghz ) survey ( phoenix ) , covering an area of 3deg@xmath1 combined with optical ( @xmath17 , @xmath18-band ) and near infrared ( @xmath7-band ) photometry and optical spectroscopy .",
    "the observations , astrometric calibration , catalogue generation and optical identifications are described in section 2 .",
    "the final catalogue is presented in section 3 , while the data analysis and the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 summarises our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a value @xmath19kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the radio observations were made at 1.46ghz using the 6a configuration of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the mosaic of 30 pointing centres covers a @xmath22 diameter area centered at @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ( galactic latitude @xmath25 ) .",
    "this field , hereafter referred to as the phoenix deep field ( pdf ) , is shown as the large disk in figure [ pdf ] .",
    "additional observations were made with a single pointing centered at @xmath26 ; @xmath27 . this",
    "is referred to as the phoenix deep field sub - region ( pdfs ) , covering 36arcmin diameter and shown in figure [ pdf ] as the small disk .",
    "the synthesised beam fwhm for the pdfs and for each of the pdf pointing centres is @xmath06 and @xmath08arcsec respectively .",
    "details of the observations , image formation , source extraction and catalogue generation are presented in hopkins _",
    "( 1998 ) . in summary , a source is included into the catalogue if its peak flux density is 4@xmath2 above the local rms and if it is confirmed by visual inspection .",
    "a total of 938 sources with fluxes s@xmath28mjy are detected within the pdf and 232 sources are extracted from the 36arcmin diameter area of the pdfs , to the limiting flux of 0.1mjy .",
    "the combined radio catalogue consists of 1079 individual sources identified on both fields .",
    "there are two kinds of incompleteness in the catalogue , as with any sample limited by peak flux density .",
    "the first is a loss of sensitivity due to the attenuation of the primary beam away from a field center .",
    "this has been minimized in the phoenix survey by the mosaicing strategy used .",
    "the second is the fact that extended objects with a total flux density above the survey limit can be missed by an algorithm which initially detects candidates based on their peak flux densities .",
    "methods of correcting these effects have been described by hopkins _",
    "the pdf catalogue is @xmath29 complete to 0.4mjy , while the pdfs is @xmath30 complete to 0.15mjy .",
    "optical ccd photometry of the phoenix field was carried out at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) during two observing runs in 1994 , 1995 september , in the @xmath17 and @xmath18-bands . in both runs ,",
    "the tek 1k ccd camera was mounted at the @xmath31/3.3 prime focus , giving an image scale of 0.39@xmath32pixel@xmath20 and a field of view of @xmath33 .",
    "the exposure time was 120 and 60sec for the @xmath17 and @xmath18-band observations respectively . between successive pointings",

    "about @xmath35 areal coverage was achieved in the @xmath18-band ( fig .",
    "[ pdf ] ) .",
    "however , due to poor weather conditions , only half of the phoenix field has yet been surveyed in the @xmath17-band .",
    "the optical data were reduced following standard procedures , using iraf tasks .",
    "firstly , the optical ccd frames were debiased using the overscan strip .",
    "secondly , dome - flats were employed to flat - field the images .",
    "bad pixel columns were removed by interpolating between adjacent columns .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "these provide both the instrumental zero point and the atmospheric extinction relation due to airmass .",
    "the photometric accuracy , estimated using these standard stars , is better than @xmath00.01mag for both @xmath17 and @xmath18-band observations .",
    "the sources in the reduced optical frames were extracted using the focas package ( jarvis & tyson 1981 ) .",
    "the main input parameters are the detection threshold , given as a multiple of the sky variance ( @xmath36 ) and the minimum area in pixels for an object to be extracted .",
    "after considerable experimentation , we adopted a threshold of 2.5@xmath37 and a minimum area of 25 pixels ( @xmath04arcsec@xmath1 ) .",
    "this choice of values minimises the number of spurious detections , while ensuring that most faint galaxies are successfully extracted . for each individual frame",
    "we masked out vignetted corners and regions contaminated by bright stars , to avoid obviously spurious detections .",
    "the catalogues generated for each individual frame were then merged into a final catalogue .",
    "because of the overlap between adjacent frames , a number of objects are recorded more than once .",
    "these records are replaced by a single object in the catalogue . a final visual inspection removed any remaining spurious detections .",
    "the completeness limit of the @xmath18-band catalogue is found to be @xmath38mag ( appendix @xmath39 ) .",
    "the astrometry on the optical images is carried out using the apm catalogue to locate @xmath010 stars on each frame . using the starlink astrom software ,",
    "an astrometric model relating the pixel positions of those stars to their astrometric positions was calculated for each frame .",
    "the astrometric coordinates of all the objects on that frame were then determined . to estimate the accuracy of the astrometry ,",
    "the positions of overlapping sources on the apm plates and on our ccd frames were compared .",
    "they were found to have an rms of @xmath40 .      to identify optically the sources detected in the radio survey we used the @xmath18-band observations , which are deeper than the @xmath17-band data and have the more complete areal coverage .",
    "we followed the technique employed by downes _",
    "( 1986 ) , calculating the probability that a given candidate is the identification by using bayes theorem : consider an optically detected candidate with magnitude @xmath41 at a distance @xmath42 from the radio position .",
    "given the surface density of objects brighter than @xmath41 , @xmath43 , the expected number of candidates within @xmath42 is    @xmath44    assuming that source positions are poissonian , the probability of at least one object brighter than @xmath41 within radius @xmath42 is    @xmath45    which reduces to @xmath4 for @xmath461 .",
    "in this case , the candidate is unlikely to be a chance association .",
    "we apply an upper limit in the search radius , @xmath47 and a cutoff in the probability , @xmath48 , to limit the optical identifications to those candidates that are least likely to be spurious alignments ( hopkins 1998a ) .",
    "the background density of the objects ( both galaxies and stars ) is calculated from our @xmath18-band observations to the limiting magnitude of @xmath49mag ( appendix @xmath39 ) . at fainter magnitudes we used the surface density of objects found by metcalfe _",
    "( 1995 ) . as a result",
    ", we propose 504 identifications to the limiting magnitude m@xmath50mag for a total of 1079 radio sources ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "to estimate colours , the flux in the @xmath17 and @xmath18-bands is integrated within an effective aperture corresponding to a physical size of @xmath015kpc radius at the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "this choice of aperture ensures that a substantial fraction of the galaxy light is enclosed .",
    "this minimizes the effect of colour gradients while increasing the s / n , especially at faint magnitudes where the uncertainties are dominated by the photon statistics of the sky background .    to facilitate comparison with other studies and to recognize that the aperture scheme used to estimate colour",
    "will tend to underestimate the fluxes of the brightest and most extended sources we used the ` total ' magnitude calculated by focas as an estimate of the total galaxy optical flux .",
    "the focas ` total ' magnitude is calculated by integrating the luminosity within an aperture defined by adding rings around the object until the detection area is exceeded by a factor of 2 .",
    "the near - infrared observations used the irac2b camera at the 2.2 m european southern observatory ( eso ) telescope at la silla and caspir at the 2.3 m australian national university ( anu ) telescope . because of the small detector format of the infrared arrays , pointed observations of a total of 46 individual radio sources",

    "+ dithering observations of each source consisted of a sequence of 6 integrations of 10sec each , or of 4 integrations of 15sec each , followed by an offset of the telescope .",
    "the number of integrations and the exposure time were adjusted to the seeing conditions , to avoid saturation of the array . to get accurate sky frames ,",
    "the offset vector was changed between successive observations . the total exposure time varied from 15min to 1h depending on the optical magnitude of the candidate .",
    "the filter used was @xmath55 ( wainscoat and cowie 1992 ) .",
    "+ after dark - field subtraction , each image was flat - fielded using dome flats .",
    "an illumination correction , accounting for the large scale sensitivity gradients of the array , was also applied ( see eso manual ) .",
    "the sky frame to be subtracted from a given target frame was generated by median combining the 20 images closest in time to the frame in question .",
    "the sky - subtracted frame was then smoothed using a @xmath56 pixel median filter , designed to preserve as much as possible the photometric integrity of the data .",
    "all the images of the same source were coadded to produce the final image .",

    "photometric calibration was performed using faint standard stars from carter and meadows ( 1995 ) .",
    "a mean extinction relation was derived for all the nights together .",
    "because of the non - photometric conditions , the uncertainty in the estimated zero point in the calibration equation was @xmath00.14mag .",

    "if this trend is real , it probably reflects differences in the luminosity function of spirals and ellipticals .",

    "alternatively , the presence of an underlying evolved stellar population in addition to main sequence stars could explain these observations .",
    "indications of two stellar populations ( old giants and younger main sequence stars ) have been found out in brighter samples of radio galaxies ( ` 1jy ' sample ; allington - smith 1982 ) .",

    "the absolute magnitude is then converted to luminosity ( l@xmath6 ) using the luminosity of vega in the @xmath18-band ( 1.86910@xmath143wm@xmath144@xmath20 ) and the relation    @xmath145    finally , having established l@xmath6 and the model sed corresponding to a given radio source , we estimate , the continuum flux at 6563 ( @xmath146 ) from the model .",

    "secondly , the spectroscopic observations are carried out only for the optically identified galaxies in the radio sample , introducing a bias against optically faint sources .    to confirm the reality of the trend seen in figure 14",
    ", we will assume that l@xmath138 and p@xmath105 are uncorrelated and we will investigate if the selection effects introduce any artificial relation between these two quantities .",
    "we adopt a limiting optical magnitude @xmath101=21.5mag , corresponding to the faintest object for which a redshift has been estimated and a radio flux density limit of 0.4mjy . to calculate the optical k - corrections",

    "it is obvious that the sample selection is not significantly affecting our results .",

    "we conclude that the strong correlation between radio power and h@xmath14 luminosity in figure 14 is real .",
    "this is interpreted as the result of the tight correlation between far - infrared and radio power ( condon 1992 ) and h@xmath14 and far - infrared luminosities ( leech _ et al _ 1988 ) .",
    "therefore , the radio power can also be used as a probe of the star - formation activity in starburst galaxies .",

    "the galaxy number counts provide a useful consistency check between our optical catalogue and other surveys .",
    "however , although the focas number counts at faint magnitudes are dominated by galaxies , at bright magnitudes ( @xmath15619.0 , hudon & lilly 1996 ) , the stellar component makes a significant contribution . to correct for this stellar contamination",
    "we adopt the following procedure .",
    "we considered a size parameter , defined as the difference between the ` core ' , @xmath157 , and ` total ' , @xmath158 , magnitude of sources .",
    "the former corresponds to the intensity within the 3@xmath523 inner pixels of an object and the latter is the integrated luminosity within an aperture defined by adding rings around the object until the detection area is exceeded by a factor of 2 .",
    "this difference is then plotted against @xmath158 ( fig .",
    "since the size parameter is sensitive to the seeing , the data taken in different conditions , should be treated separately .",
    "consequently , we grouped the images of a given night according to the seeing conditions at the time of the observation and performed the star - galaxy separation for each group individually .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure a1 where the size parameter is plotted against the ` total ' magnitude for frames with similar seeing conditions , with the stellar sequence demarcated with a solid lined rectangular box .",
    "the distribution of stars and galaxies in this figure overlaps at magnitudes fainter than @xmath101=20.0mag . beyond that magnitude limit",
    "no attempt is made to further eliminate stars from the sample , since compact galaxies could be mistakenly removed .",
    "furthermore , the number of stars relative to galaxies becomes increasingly smaller beyond this magnitude .",
    "the galaxy number counts are shown in figure a2 along with the compilation of metcalfe _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) . for @xmath159mag",
    "our counts seem to be in good agreement with the recent determinations . at fainter magnitudes",
    "the sample is affected by incompleteness .",
    "additionally , the star counts in figure a2 ( small circles ) are also in good agreement with the predictions of the model of bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) .",
    "to estimate the average h@xmath82 absorption for the sample of @xmath85 radio sources ( where h@xmath14 lies within the observable window ) , we consider the relation between the h@xmath82 and h@xmath14+[nii ] equivalent widths for star - forming galaxies and seyfert 2 type objects , presented in figure b1 . additionally , radio galaxies with absorption line spectra ( for which ew@xmath160 ) and only h@xmath14 emission line , classified star - forming galaxies in section 4.1 , are also plotted in figure b1 .",
    "the best fit to the data , shown with the continuous line in that figure , follows the relation    @xmath161}}/(9.1\\pm0.4)-(1.7\\pm0.3).\\ ] ]    the coefficients in equation ( b1 ) imply a mean h@xmath82 absorption of @xmath84 .",
    "kennicutt ( 1992 ) , following a similar procedure , found an average stellar h@xmath82 absorption of @xmath162 for normal galaxies .",
    "however , a value of -2 is usually used in the literature for hii regions ( tresse _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , in good agreement with our result .",
    "in this study we adopt the galaxy models developed by pozzetti , bruzual & zamorani ( 1996 ) that make use of the population synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) to generate evolutionary models for ellipticals ( e / s0 ) , early ( sab / sbc ) and late ( scd / sdm ) type spirals and very blue galaxies ( vb ) , meant to reproduce the starburst population present at each redshift .",
    "assuming @xmath163km@xmath20s@xmath20mpc@xmath20 , @xmath164 and a formation redshift of @xmath165 , corresponding to an age of 12.7gyr , the adopted parameters for the different galaxy types , are listed in table c1 .",
    "the local properties of e / s0 and sab / sbc galaxies are best represented by an exponentially decaying star formation rate ( sfr ) , of the form @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the e - folding time .",
    "a value of @xmath167=1 and 8gyr was adopted for the e / s0 and sab / sbc galaxies respectively .",
    "late type spirals and starbursts are best represented by a constant sfr and different ages ."
