    "<S> recently , several unstable proton emitting nuclei with medium and heavy masses @xcite have been discovered and are attracting much attention in both theoretical and experimental nuclear physics . in the light mass limit </S>",
    "<S> unbound @xmath0 is another well studied proton emitter nucleus which presents some intriguing phenomena such as the @xmath1 intruder level and the @xmath2 mirror states discussed in the recent literature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parent nucleus decays by proton emission in a quantum tunneling process . in a first approximation </S>",
    "<S> we can treat this problem as an unbound @xmath3 system in which the ground - states instabilities are studied from the single - particle resonance point of view . </S>",
    "<S> these resonances have large half - lives as long as @xmath4 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the great difficulties presented in these calculations is the determination of the separation energies and half - lives because these states have a long lifetime in comparison with the oscillation time inside the potential well : the energies are of the order of @xmath4 @xmath6 and are extremely narrow resonances @xmath7 corresponding to the half - lives @xmath8 ( an enormous numerical computation time would be necessary to sweep some @xmath9 of energy by steps of the order of their width size in search of the resonance position ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - parity assignment to the measured levels is another arduous task , and because the proton decay has a strong dependence on the angular momentum , the spin - parity predictions for some ground - state proton emitters are assigned by matching the experimental half - life with the theoretical calculations such as the wkb method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several theoretical methods @xcite have already been presented to calculate the half - lives and spins of these nuclei and we are presenting another method based on solving the schrdinger equation in a continuum discretization context@xcite . the purpose of this work is to calculate the decay properties , such as energies and half - lives , of some proton emitters implementing a careful numerical treatment to this continuum projection method .    </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state proton emitters are treated in connection with an isolated long lifetime single - particle resonance . using orthogonal and complementary projectors the scattering solution @xmath10 of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath11 at energy @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> can be written as@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a normalized single - particle state and @xmath15 projects onto the complementary sub - space of the single - particle hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> projection and formal manipulation of the schrdinger equation @xmath16 then gives @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the green s function and @xmath20 is the scattering solution of the projected hamiltonian @xmath21 at energy @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 solution is obtained by solving the inhomogeneous equation @xmath22 with @xmath23 adjusted to satisfy the orthogonal relation @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant energy , @xmath25 , is defined as the energy for which the integrated internal probability density is largest and @xmath14 is chosen as being proportional to the internal part of the resonant wave function @xmath26 , truncated at a radius somewhat larger than the potential radius , containing the principal behaviour of the resonance inside the well : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a normalization factor , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the truncation parameters for @xmath31 . thus the complex single - particle resonance energy @xmath32 is calculated in the energy @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part @xmath33 corresponds to the single - particle width and the associated half - life is given as @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential utilized in the single - particle hamiltonian contains the central potential in a woods - saxon form and the spin - orbit term with a woods - saxon derivative form , also including the centrifugal and coulomb ( as a uniformly charged sphere ) terms .    to determine the resonance parameters for the ground - state proton emitters </S>",
    "<S> , special attention must be taken in the numerical implementation of this method because these very narrow resonances are difficult to detect and require a more accurate search . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle resonance energy @xmath35 is obtained imposing that it must reproduce the experimental @xmath36 value by adjusting the central and spin - orbit potentials . to avoid wasting much computational time , and to achieve a better accuracy in the results , </S>",
    "<S> we start with an initial energy range near the experimental @xmath36 value to solve the schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the energy range is swept with a integration energy step  @xmath37 to localize the energy @xmath25 where @xmath35 and @xmath38 are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> after this , a new energy range is defined near @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the range size is fixed at @xmath4 @xmath39 centered in @xmath35 , and it is swept again with a energy improvement in the integration step @xmath37 , making a new @xmath25 determination in which the @xmath35 and @xmath38 are recalculated . </S>",
    "<S> this recurrent relation is followed until the @xmath35 and @xmath38 values became stable . in this way we search these resonances , sweeping successive energy ranges ( sized about @xmath39 centered in @xmath40 ) , by improving the integration energy step . </S>",
    "<S> the woods - saxon central and spin - orbit parameters ( see table [ tab0 ] ) are adjusted by making the stabilized energy @xmath35 reproduce the experimental @xmath36 value . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we present a typical example of this calculation for @xmath41 for which the potential was adjusted to reproduce the experimental ground - state energy . in table [ tab1 ] our results are presented in comparison with the other methods showing a good agreement between the data . </S>",
    "<S> the small differences between our calculations and the experimental results are due to the fact that we assume a pure single - particle configuration in a spherical model while the real system may have soft deformations or mixing configurations altering the occupation probabilities .    </S>",

    "<S> , the localization of the resonance shows up as the opposite problem to the one of the heaviest proton emitters , because here , the resonance width is as broad as the value of its position in energy , indicating that the half - life is approximately identical to its short oscillation time inside the well , which brings some uncertainty in the evaluation of the decay properties .    </S>",
