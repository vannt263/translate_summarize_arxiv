    "axelrod s model for the dissemination of culture takes into account two key ingredients of social dynamics @xcite , namely , social influence through which people become more similar when they interact and homophily , which is the tendency of individuals to interact preferentially with similar others @xcite .",
    "explicitly , in axelrod s model the individuals are modeled by agents which are strings of cultural features of length @xmath16 , where each feature can adopt a certain number @xmath1 of distinct states .",
    "the @xmath16 cultural features of an agent determine its culture .",
    "the @xmath17 agents are fixed at the nodes of a network ( regular lattice or complex network ) and the interaction between two connected agents takes place with probability proportional to the number of states they have in common and always results in an increase of the similarity between them .",
    "whereas social influence is a main feature of the standard two - opinion voter model @xcite and homophily has been allowed for in the three - opinion constrained voter model @xcite , the number of states  two and three , respectively  is not a free parameter in those models . as a result ,",
    "the two - opinion voter model exhibits only consensus absorbing configurations in regular lattices of arbitrary dimension @xcite ( see , however , @xcite for a report of incomplete ordering on small - world networks ) . the same conclusion holds for the constrained voter model in an infinite one - dimensional lattice ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and since increasing the range of the agents interactions favors the consensus regime @xcite , we expect this conclusion to hold for regular lattices of higher dimension as well . in axelrod s model , however , increase of the number of states @xmath1 for a fixed string length @xmath16 leads the social dynamics to freeze in multicultural absorbing configurations even in a one - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "in fact , axelrod s model exhibits two types of absorbing configurations in the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 : ordered configurations , which are characterized by a few cultural domains of macroscopic size @xmath19 , and disordered configurations , where all domains are microscopic @xcite . by cultural domain we mean a bounded region of uniform culture .",
    "the competition between the disorder of the initial configuration that favors cultural fragmentation and the ordering bias of social influence that favors homogenization results in the nonequilibrium phase transition between those two classes of absorbing states @xcite .",
    "we note that , similarly to the standard percolation @xcite , the phase transition occurs in the properties of the absorbing states and so it is static in nature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the nonequilibrium phase transition of a variant of axelrod s model in which the initial states of the @xmath16 cultural features of the agents are drawn randomly from a poisson distribution of parameter @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 . in the original model , these states are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution on the integers @xmath23 @xcite . in the square lattice ,",
    "the poisson variant exhibits a continuous phase transition for @xmath0 and a discontinuous one for @xmath24 @xcite . in the one - dimensional lattice ,",
    "only the disordered regime exists for @xmath0 and a discontinuous transition between the disordered and the ordered regimes is observed for @xmath25 @xcite . here we focus on the case @xmath0 only and study the effect of long range interactions on the standard order parameter of axelrod s model @xmath26 that measures the fraction of agents that belong to the largest cultural domain , whose size is denoted by @xmath27 , averaged over many independent runs ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .    a previous study of the continuous phase transition for @xmath0 in the square lattice considered as order parameter the mean density of domains @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the number of domains of an absorbing configuration , and showed that it vanishes as @xmath30 with @xmath31 at the critical point @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath33 is not an order parameter for the standard percolation since it is continuous and non - zero at the threshold @xcite .",
    "the advantage of considering @xmath33 is that it is nonzero in the disordered regime where the convergence of the dynamics to the absorbing configurations is very fast as compared to the convergence to the quasi - consensus configurations of the ordered regime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the present study complements that analysis by showing that the more usual order parameter @xmath3 vanishes at the critical point as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , here we study the effect of long range interactions by considering small - world networks in which each link of the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions is rewired with probability @xmath8 .",
    "rewiring of a link is done by replacing the original neighbor of a given site by a random site chosen uniformly among all possible sites that avoid self - loops and link duplication @xcite .",
    "the average degree of the resulting network is 4 regardless of the value of @xmath8 .",
    "the extremes @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to the regular square lattice and to a random network , respectively . since the underlying regular lattice used to generate the small - world networks is the square lattice we can introduce the length @xmath38 , although it has no geometrical meaning for @xmath39 .",
    "we find that the transition is discontinuous for @xmath40 and that the critical exponent that determines the width of the critical region for finite @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "however , in the case @xmath36 where the transition is continuous we find @xmath43 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . for the sake of completeness , in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we present a brief account of axelrod s model @xcite and of the watts and strogatz algorithm for constructing small - world networks @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : op ] we study the behavior of the order parameter @xmath3 near the critical region for three network topologies : the square lattice ( @xmath36 ) , random networks ( @xmath37 ) and small - world networks with rewiring probability @xmath44 . finally , section [ sec : conc ] offers our concluding remarks .",
    "the poisson variant of axelrod s model differs from the original model only by the procedure that generates the cultural states of the agents at the beginning of the simulation : for each feature @xmath45 of each agent @xmath46 a state @xmath47 is drawn independently using the distribution ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "once the initial configuration is set , the dynamics proceeds as in the original model @xcite .",
    "in particular , at each time we pick an agent at random  the target agent  as well as one of its neighbors .",
    "these two agents interact with probability equal to their cultural similarity , defined as the fraction of common cultural features they have .",
    "an interaction consists of selecting at random one of the distinct features , and making the selected feature of the target agent equal to the corresponding feature of its neighbor .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the system is frozen into an absorbing configuration . according to these rules , at an absorbing configuration any pair of neighbors are either identical or completely different regarding their cultural states .",
    "a feature that sets axelrod s model apart from most lattice models that exhibit nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite is that all stationary states of the dynamics are absorbing states , i.e. , the dynamics always freezes in one of these states .",
    "this contrasts with lattice models that exhibit an active state in addition to infinitely many absorbing states @xcite and the phase transition occurs between the active state and the usually equivalent absorbing states ( see @xcite for a simple change in the update rule of axelrod s model that results in dynamically active metastable states ) .",
    "the implementation of the watts and strogatz algorithm @xcite for constructing the small - world networks used in our study begins with a square lattice of linear size @xmath41 with nearest neighbors interactions and periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. , a torus ) .",
    "then for every site @xmath48 we rewire the link between @xmath49 and , say , its left neighbor , with probability @xmath8 .",
    "as mentioned before , rewiring of a link is done by replacing the original neighbor of site @xmath49 ( in this case , the left neighbor ) by a random site chosen uniformly among all possible sites that avoid self - loops and link duplication . the procedure is then repeated for , say , the top neighbor of every site of the lattice .",
    "note that for @xmath37 the resulting network is not a classic random network @xcite , since the rewiring scheme guarantees that any site will be connected to at least @xmath50 other sites , whereas for classical random graphs any site has probability @xmath51 of being isolated from the other @xmath52 sites .",
    "otherwise , the resulting networks are very similar to classical random graphs .",
    "for a randomly generated initial configuration of the agents cultures , we follow the dynamics of axelrod s model until it reaches an absorbing state  this comprises a single run ",
    "and then we calculate the size of the largest cultural domain @xmath27 .",
    "average of this quantity over a large number of independent runs ( typically @xmath53 ) , which differ by the choice of the initial cultural states of the agents as well as by their update sequence , yields the order parameter @xmath26 we use to characterize the nature of the absorbing configurations . in the case of random ( @xmath37 ) and small world ( @xmath54 ) networks we generate a different network for each run .     as function of the poisson parameter @xmath2 for the square lattice ( @xmath36 ) ,",

    "this figure reveals a few interesting features of axelrod s model .",
    "first , the presence of long range links favors the ordered regime as indicated by the shift of the threshold region to high values of @xmath2 , i.e. , as the fraction @xmath8 of long - range links increases , the disorder in the initial configuration must also increase in order the dynamics reaches a disordered absorbing configuration @xcite .",
    "second , deep into the ordered phase , say for @xmath62 , the order parameter is completely insensitive to increasing the fraction of long - range links beyond a certain value , say @xmath44 .",
    "third , the crossing of the data for different @xmath41 for @xmath15 signals the presence of a discontinuous transition in the limit @xmath63 , whereas for @xmath36 the condition @xmath64 for @xmath65 is satisfied for all values of @xmath66",
    ".    next we study in detail the behavior of the order parameter @xmath3 in the critical region for the three network topologies exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the square lattice considered here exhibits only short range interactions and so it offers a baseline for assessing the effects of long - range links on the phase transition of axelrod s model .",
    "in addition , as pointed out before , this study complements previous analyses of the poisson variant of axelrod s model in the square lattice @xcite .",

    "our analysis shows , however , that even in the extreme case of random networks those disordered configurations persist , provided the disorder of the initial configurations is sufficiently high , i.e. , @xmath170 ( see also @xcite ) . nonetheless , in agreement with axelrod s hunch , long - range links",
    "do favor ordered configurations as indicated by the increase of @xmath9 with the rewiring probability @xmath8 .",
    "this is so because the rewired links provide short - cuts to connect distant sites on the square lattice and , as a result , the walls ( i.e. , links connecting agents that do not interact because of their antagonistic cultures ) can easily be circumvented by the dominant culture .",
    "in fact , this is also the reason the ordered phase is absent in the poisson variant of the one - dimensional axelrod model for @xmath0 , whereas it is present in the two - dimensional model considered here @xcite .",
    "the switch of the transition from continuous to discontinuous when long - range links are introduced has to do with the suppression of fluctuations by those links , which makes the model more mean - field - like than the short - range model ( see @xcite for the discussion of similar findings in the context of the ising and voter models ) .",
    "the distinctive aspect of our work on small - world networks is that we were able to characterize the critical region , i.e. , to estimate the sharpness of the threshold through the critical exponent @xmath150 ( see section [ sec : rand ] ) .",

    "[ fig:7 ] and [ fig:8 ] .",
    "our findings regarding the critical behavior of @xmath3 in the square lattice for which the nonequilibrium phase transition is continuous @xcite corroborate its unique character : the critical exponents @xmath171 and @xmath43 set it apart from the known universality classes of nonequilibrium lattice models @xcite .",
    "this may be due to the distinctive static character of the transition , which separates two types of absorbing configurations that differ on their distributions of domain sizes .",
