    "baryons containing heavy quarks have always been interesting .",
    "recently many new excited charmed baryon states have been discovered by cleo , babar , belle and fermilab .",
    "heavy baryons have narrow widths and they are hard to produce . as products in the decays of heavy mesons or in hadron colliders , the cross sections to produce them",
    "are amall .",
    "there are no resonant production mechanisms as for heavy mesons .",
    "so , heavy baryons always have been obtained by continuum production@xcite .",
    "furthermore , non of the quantum numbers , listed in the pdg book , are really measured , but are assignments based on quark model@xcite .    despite these problems ,",
    "the meaning to study these baryons is important .",
    "heavy baryons provide a laboratory to study the dynamics of the light quarks in the environment of heavy quark , such as their chiral symmetry@xcite .",
    "it really is an ideal place for studying the dynamics of diquark . in these baryons",
    ", a heavy quark can be used as a flavor tag to help us to go further in understanding the nonperturbative qcd than do the light baryons@xcite . theoretically , the study of heavy baryons has a long story@xcite .",
    "but , up to now , simple and reliable estimates for the experimental quantities regarding to the baryon spectroscopy , the production and decay rates are still lack .",
    "so lots of work have to be done for theorists .    at present , only for single - charmed baryons masses of ground states as well as many of their excitations are known experimentally with rather good precision .",
    "if the spectrum of the single charmed baryons is well known , it will provide us a framework for studying baryons with one bottom quark and help for understanding the doubly or triply charmed baryons . in this paper",
    ", we use the jaffe - wilczek @xcite model to predict masses of single charmed pentaquark states with @xmath5 . in the following section we introduce the diqurk concept and the jaffe - wilczek model ; in section 3 we give the mass formula and our results . in the end",
    ", a discussion will be given in section 4 .",
    "the concept of diquark appeared soon after the original papers on quarks@xcite .",
    "it was used to calculate the hadron properties .",
    "it helps us to understand hadron structure and high energy particle reactions@xcite . in heavy quark",
    "effective theory , two light quarks often refer to as diquark , which is treated as particle in parallel with quark themself .",
    "there are several phenomenal manifestations of diquark : the @xmath6 mass difference , the isospin @xmath7 rule , the structure function ratio of neutron to proton , _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of diquark : the good and the bad diquark .",
    "the good diquark is more favorable energetically than the bad , which is indicated by both the one - gluon exchange and instanton calculations . in @xmath8 , the good",
    "diquark has flavor - spin symmetry @xmath9 while the bad @xmath10 . to give a color singlet state , both kinds of diquark have the same color symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "two diquarks obey boson statistyic while two quarks in a diquark obey fermi statistic .",
    "jaffe and wilczek used only the good diquark in their paper@xcite .",
    "jaffe and wilczek s pentaquark is composed of two good diquarks and an antiquark .",
    "the two diquarks combine into a color antisymmetric @xmath12 and flavor symmetric @xmath13 with components : @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath14[us]_+$ ] , @xmath14[ds]_+$ ] and @xmath15[ds]_+$ ] .",
    "in the following , we use @xmath17 $ ] to denote a good diquark , and @xmath18 a bad .",
    "the spin wave function is symmetric because the diquark has spin zero . to give a totally symmetric wave function ,",
    "an orbital excitation between the two diquarks is needed which combines the spin of antiquark to give state @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "two diquarks can also combine into an @xmath8 symmetric @xmath21 , with no orbital excitation@xcite .",
    "take into the antiquark into account , we can obtain states with @xmath22 .",
    "jaffe and wilczek havent considered the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states in their model . in summary , we list the quantum numbers of these diquark systems in table [ quantumnumber ] .",
    "the combination of two diquarks with an antiquark gives @xmath8 multiplets @xmath25 for flavor @xmath26 two diquarks combination and @xmath27 for @xmath21 . by replacing an @xmath28 quark with a @xmath29 quark",
    ", we get states of charmed or hidden charmed baryons . in this paper",
    ", we only consider baryons with one charm quark and with no charmed antiquark , i.e. the single charmed baryons .",
    ".summary of the diquark quantum numbers .",
    "the two quarks obey fermi statistics wile the diquarks do bose .",
    "the subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath28 are antisymmetric and symmetric for short . [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     if we take the ideal mixing for @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , the flavor assignments of charmed pentaquarks composed of good diquark are @xmath33[lc]\\bar{l}$ ] for @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36[lc]\\bar{l}$ ] for @xmath37 .",
    "because the mass of @xmath38 $ ] is unknown , we will not consider @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , in equation ( [ eq : eqmass ] ) we have not considered the splitting of the @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 states .",
    "the @xmath42 is generally lower in energy , so we take equation([eq : eqmass ] ) as the mass formula for states @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath2 state with no orbital angular momentum is a little simpler . with a substitution of un - charmed bad diquark for good diquark",
    ", we can get more masses of single charmed baryons .",
    "since the bad diquark is a spin triplet , we encounter the problem as before both for the @xmath44 pentaquark .",
    "we still only take states with the lowest angular momentum .",
    "all the masses of single charmed baryons we can get are showed in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "they are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 mev for @xmath35(@xmath49 ) , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 mev for @xmath37 . for a comparison ,",
    "the experimental data are also there .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath35 have the same predicted masses , because we ca nt distinguish them when use formula [ eq : eqmass ] . the lowest predicted mass with @xmath2 lies between the experimental @xmath54 doublet .",
    "the masses of bad diquark @xmath55 and @xmath56 are so closed which leads to baryons of the same quantum numbers and with one bad diquark having almost the same mass .",
    "the predicted @xmath57 to have @xmath58 is coincided with an early conjecture@xcite for @xmath59 . for @xmath37 ,",
    "there is one state @xmath60 near the predicted state @xmath61 with the same @xmath2 , and @xmath62 with @xmath4 is very close to experimental @xmath63 .",
    "the masses of @xmath64 and @xmath61 of our predictions are a little heavy than the lowest masses predicted in ref.@xcite . in their papers , different symmetry or mix",
    "have led to more heavy results such as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which are above our predictions of baryon @xmath2 with good diquark .",
    "this means that pentaquarks may be relatively stable than some three - quark baryons .",
    "the @xmath67 is lower a lot than other theoretic predictions with mass about 2700 mev @xcite which is easy to understand because in their models @xmath49 and @xmath35 are well to split .",
    "lastly , we just simply discuss decays of these baryons .",
    "the combining energy of diquark with one charm quark is relatively small . in the `` fall - apart '' mechanism , the dominant decay mode of these five quark objects is decaying into a three - quark charmed baryon and a @xmath68 meson .",
    "for example , the @xmath69 @xmath70 which has a mass 2620 mev can decay into the @xmath71 @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "we note that in the early paper of copley@xcite the decay of @xmath74 @xmath75 to @xmath73 and pion is forbidden by energy conservation .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the jaffe - wilczek s diquark model for @xmath4 pentaquark to dealing with charmed baryons .",
    "we have given a spectrum of @xmath76 lowest lying charmed pentaqurank and compared them with experimental data .",
    "we find that some states have experimental correspondences .",
    "the mass formula we used is just schematic .",
    "it is better to include mass contribution from the pauli blocking and annihilation effects@xcite . but to quantify them is somewhat difficult .",
    "energy contribution from pauli blocking is conjectured to have relation @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 which means the two - diquark subsystem of flavor symmetry @xmath21 is heaver than the one of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "if so , states of @xmath2 will be a little heavier than our predictions .    a problem ?",
