    "superconducting proximity effects in ferromagnet / superconductor heterostructures ( f / s ) have received much attention in the past few decades both for their important applications in spintronics@xcite and because of the underlying physics@xcite .",
    "although ferromagnetism and @xmath1-wave superconductivity are largely incompatible because of the opposite nature of the spin structure of their order parameters , they can still coexist in nanoscale f / s systems via superconducting proximity effects@xcite .",
    "the fundamental feature of proximity effects in f / s heterostructures is the damped oscillatory behavior of the superconducting order parameter in the f regions@xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the reason is that a spin singlet cooper pair acquires a finite momentum when it encounters the exchange field as it enters the ferromagnet .",
    "this affects the momenta of individual electrons that compose the cooper pairs , and modifies both ordinary and andreev@xcite reflection .",
    "the interference between the transmitted and reflected cooper pair wave functions in the f regions leads to an oscillatory behavior of the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath2 , on the thickness @xmath10 of the ferromagnet in f / s bilayers@xcite . because of these oscillations the superconductivity may even disappear in a certain range of f thicknesses .",
    "indeed , this reentrant superconductivity with geometry was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed.@xcite another remarkable fact related to f / s proximity effects is that triplet pairing correlations may be induced in f / s systems where s is in the ordinary @xmath1-wave pairing state.@xcite these correlations can be long ranged , extending deep into both the f and s regions .",
    "the pauli principle requires the corresponding condensate wavefunction ( in the @xmath1-channel ) to be odd in frequency@xcite or time@xcite .",
    "the magnetic inhomogeneity arising from the presence of the ferromagnet in f / s systems is responsible for this type of triplet pairing .",
    "the components of the triplet pairing correlations are restricted , because of conservation laws , by the magnetic structure in the f layers : only the total spin projection corresponding to the @xmath11 component can be induced when the exchange fields arising from the ferromagnetic structure are all aligned in the same direction , while all three components ( @xmath12 ) can arise when the exchange fields are not aligned . because of the exchange fields , singlet pairing correlations decay in f with a short range decay length . on the other hand ,",
    "the induced triplet pairing correlations can be long ranged , with their length scale being comparable to that of the usual slow decay associated with nonmagnetic metal proximity effects .",
    "early experiments revealed a long range decay length in the differential resistance in a ferromagnetic metallic wire ( co ) which can be well explained within a framework that accounts for triplet pairing correlations.@xcite more recently , experimental observations of long range spin triplet supercurrents have been reported in several multilayer systems , @xcite and also in nb / ho bilayers.@xcite in the last case , the requisite magnetic inhomogeneity arises from the spiral magnetic structure inherent to the rare earth compound , ho , which gives rise also to oscillations@xcite in @xmath2 .",
    "other theoretical work@xcite in the semiclassical limit shows that in the half metallic ferromagnet case spin flip scattering at the interface provides a mechanism for conversion between a short range singlet state and an ordinary ( even in frequency or time ) triplet one in the @xmath13-wave channel .",
    "this holds also@xcite for strongly polarized magnets .",
    "both the short and long spatial range of the oscillatory singlet and odd triplet correlations in the ferromagnetic regions permit control over the critical temperature , @xmath2 , that is , the switching on or off of superconductivity .",
    "the long range propagation of equal spin triplet correlations in the ferromagnetic regions was shown to contribute to a spin valve effect that varies with the relative magnetization in the f layers@xcite . with continual interest in nonvolatile memories ,",
    "a number of spin valve type of structures have been proposed .",
    "these use various arrangements of s and f layers to turn superconductivity on or off .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that when two ferromagnet layers are placed in direct contact and adjacent to a superconductor , new types of spin valves@xcite or josephson junctions@xcite with interesting and unexpected behavior can ensue . for an @xmath14 superconducting memory device@xcite",
    ", the oscillatory decay of the singlet correlations can be manipulated by switching the relative magnetization in the f layers from parallel to antiparallel by application of an external magnetic field .",
    "it has also been shown@xcite using quasiclassical methods that for these @xmath14 structures the critical temperature can have a minimum at a relative magnetization angle that lies between the parallel and antiparallel configuration .",
    "this is in contrast with @xmath15 trilayers , where ( as indicated by both@xcite theory and experiment@xcite ) the behavior of @xmath2 with relative angle is strictly monotonic , with a minimum when the magnetizations are parallel and a maximum when antiparallel . for @xmath16 type structures ,",
    "the exchange field in the magnets can increase the josephson current,@xcite or , in the case on non - collinear alignment,@xcite induce triplet correlations and discernible signatures in the corresponding density of states .",
    "following up on this work , an @xmath17 spin switch was experimentally demonstrated@xcite using @xmath18 multilayers .",
    "supercurrent flow through the sample was completely inhibited by changing the mutual orientation of the magnetizations in the two adjacent f layers .",
    "a related phenomenon was reported@xcite for a similar multilayer spin valve , demonstrating that the critical temperature can be higher for parallel orientation of relative magnetizations .",
    "a spin valve like effect was also experimentally realized@xcite in @xmath19 superlattices , where antiferromagnetic coupling between the fe layers permits gradual rotation of the relative magnetization direction in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 layers .",
    "as already mentioned , the @xmath6 behavior in the @xmath20 geometry is in stark contrast to that observed in the more commonly studied spin switch structures involving @xmath21 configurations .",
    "there , as the angle @xmath3 between the ( coplanar ) magnetizations increases from zero ( parallel , p , configuration ) to @xmath22 ( antiparallel , ap , configuration ) @xmath2 increases monotonically . for these systems",
    "it has been demonstrated too that under many conditions they can be made to switch from a superconducting state ( at large @xmath3 ) to a normal one @xcite in the p configuration , by flipping the magnetization orientation in one of the f layers . the ap state however is robust : it is always the lowest energy state regardless of relative strength of the ferromagnets , interface scattering , and geometrical variations .",
    "the principal reason for this stems from the idea that the average exchange field overall is smaller for the ap relative orientation of the magnetization .",
    "early experimental data on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the transition temperatures for the ap and p configurations , was obtained in cuni / nb / cuni@xcite .",
    "there @xmath25 , was found to be about 6 mk .",
    "later , it was found that @xmath26 can be as large as 41 mk in ni / nb / ni trilayers@xcite .",
    "recently , the angular dependence of @xmath2 of @xmath21 systems was also measured in cuni / nb / cuni trilayers and its monotonic behavior found to be in good agreement with theory@xcite .",
    "in addition to the experimental work , the thermodynamic properties of @xmath21 nanostructures were studied quasiclassically by solving the usadel equations@xcite .",
    "it was seen that these properties are strongly dependent on the mutual orientation of the f layers .",
    "the difference in the free energies of the p and ap states can be of the same order of magnitude as the superconducting condensation energy itself . in light of the differences between @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", it appears likely that a full microscopic theory is needed that accounts for the geometric interference effects and quantum interference effects that are present due to the various scattering processes .",
    "f@xmath27s trilayer .",
    "the outer ferromagnetic layer @xmath4 has a magnetization oriented at an angle @xmath28 in the @xmath29 plane , while the inner ferromagnet , @xmath5 , has a magnetization orientation at an angle @xmath30 in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "all relevant widths are labeled .",

    "we also calculate the critical temperature by solving the linearized bdg equations . as a function of the angle @xmath3 , it is often non - monotonic , possessing a minimum that lies approximately midway between the parallel and antiparallel configurations .",
    "reentrant behavior occurs when this minimum drops to zero .",
    "we find that there are induced odd triplet correlations and we study their behavior .",
    "these correlations are found to be often long ranged in both the s and f regions .",
    "these findings are consistent with the single particle behavior exhibited by the density of states and magnetic moment in these structures .",
    "we consider a trilayer @xmath17 structure infinite in the @xmath29 plane , and with total length @xmath31 in the @xmath32 direction , which is normal to the interfaces .",
    "the inner ferromagnet layer ( @xmath5 ) of width @xmath33 is adjacent to the outer ferromagnet ( @xmath4 ) of width @xmath34 , and the superconductor has width @xmath35 ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) .",

    "we describe the magnetism of the f layers by an effective exchange field @xmath40 that vanishes in the s layer .",

    "amplitudes with spin @xmath43 , we use the bogoliubov - de gennes@xcite ( bdg ) formalism . in our geometry",
    ", the bdg equations can be written down after a few steps@xcite in the quasi - one - dimensional form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the usual single particle hamiltonian , @xmath46 is the exchange field in the f layers , @xmath47 is the pair potential , taken to be real , and the wavefunctions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the standard coefficients that appear when the usual field operators @xmath50 are expressed in terms of a bogoliubov transformation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 for spin down ( up ) .",
    "we must include all four spin components since the exchange field in the ferromagnets destroys the spin rotation invariance .    to ensure that the system is in an , at least locally , thermodynamically stable state , eq .",

    "the figure dramatically displays , as anticipated in the introduction , that as opposed to @xmath114 trilayers , @xmath2 does not usually , in our present case , monotonically increase as @xmath3 increases from 0 to @xmath22 , but on the contrary it has often a minimum at a value of @xmath3 typically below @xmath115 .",
    "the top panel , which shows results for several intermediate values of @xmath99 with @xmath107 , illustrates the above statements .",
    "@xmath2 is found in this case to be monotonic only at the smallest value of @xmath99 ( @xmath116 ) considered .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior starts to set in at around @xmath117 and then it continues , with the minimum @xmath2 remaining at about @xmath108 .",

    "we consider a fixed value of @xmath89 and several values of @xmath88 .",
    "this panel makes another important point : the four curves plotted in the top panel and the four ones in this panel correspond to identical values of the product @xmath118 .",
    "the results , while not exactly the same , are extremely similar and confirm that the oscillations in @xmath2 are determined by the overall periodicity of the cooper pair amplitudes in @xmath76 materials as determined by the difference between up and down fermi wavevectors , which is approximately proportional@xcite to @xmath119 in the range of @xmath99 shown . in the lowest panel of the figure we show that reentrance with @xmath3 can occur in these structures .",
    "the results there are for @xmath120 and at @xmath91 , a value a little larger than that considered in the other panels . while such reentrance is not the rule , we have found that it is not an exceptional situation either : the minimum in @xmath2 at intermediate @xmath3 can simply drop to zero , resulting in reentrance .",
    "the origin of this reentrance stems from the presence of triplet correlations due to the inhomogeneous magnetization and the usual @xmath88 reentrance in f / s bilayers@xcite , that is , the periodicity of the pair amplitudes mentioned above .",

    "( [ del ] ) , as evaluated from the self consistent calculations described in sec .",
    "[ methods ] .",
    "the behavior of @xmath121 is rather straightforwardly described and has some features representative of conventional proximity effects found in other ferromagnet - superconductor configurations , such as f / s or @xmath114 structures .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where that spatial behavior of @xmath121 is shown for a few cases of exchange fields differing in orientation and magnitude , as well as ferromagnet widths .",

    "we see that in the s layer , the pair amplitude rises steadily over a length scale of order of the correlation length .",
    "the variation of the overall amplitude in s with @xmath3 reflects that of the transition temperature , as was depicted for this case by the ( purple ) squares in the top panel of fig .",
    "one sees that the non - monotonic trends observed in the critical temperature correlate well with the zero temperature pair amplitude behavior . in the f layers , we observe a more complicated behavior and oscillations with an overall smaller amplitude .",
    "these oscillations are characteristic of conventional f / s proximity effects , which in this case appear somewhat chaotic because of reflections and interference at the @xmath112 and end boundaries .",
    "this irregular spatial behavior is also due to the chosen value of @xmath99 and the characteristic spatial periodicity @xmath123 not matching @xmath88 .",
    "these geometric effects can in some cases , result in the amplitudes of the singlet pair oscillations in @xmath37 exceeding those in the superconductor near the interface .    in the central panel results for several values of @xmath99 and the same geometry as the top one",
    "are shown where the typical location of the minimum in @xmath2 may occur at a relative magnetization angle of @xmath124 .",
    "we see that for the case @xmath116 , where @xmath2 is high and monotonic with @xmath3 , singlet correlations are significant and they are spread throughout the entire structure .",
    "this is consistent with the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the critical temperature is highest , and increases only slightly with @xmath3 . for the other values of @xmath99 , there is a strong @xmath2 minimum near @xmath108 and consequently , the pair amplitude is much smaller .",
    "the weakening of the superconductivity in s inevitably leads to its weakening in the f layers .",
    "the bottom panel demonstrates how the pair amplitude in the structure becomes modified when @xmath3 is varied , in a way similar to the top panel , except in this case the inner layer is thinner with @xmath111 and the outer layer is thicker with @xmath110 . comparing the top and bottom panels",
    ", we see that clearly geometric effects can be quite influential on the spatial behavior of singlet pairing correlations . in this case",
    "the @xmath37 layer is too thin for @xmath109 to exhibit oscillations within it .          in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the induced triplet pairing correlations in our systems . as mentioned in the introduction , the triplet pairing correlations may coexist with the usual singlet pairs in f / s heterostructures and their behavior is in many ways quite different : in particular the characteristic proximity length can be quite large . as a function of the angle @xmath3 the possible existence of the different triplet amplitudes",
    "is restricted@xcite by conservation laws .",
    "for instance , at @xmath125 ( parallel exchange fields ) the @xmath126 component along our @xmath39 axis of quantization , @xmath127 , must identically vanish , while @xmath128 is allowed .",
    "this is because at @xmath125 the @xmath129 component of the total cooper pair spin is conserved , although the total spin quantum number @xmath130 is not .",
    "neither quantity is conserved for arbitrary @xmath3 . for directions other than @xmath125 restrictions arising from the symmetry properties can be inferred@xcite most easily by projecting onto the @xmath39 axis the quasiparticle amplitudes along a different axis in the @xmath29 plane via a unitary spin rotation operator , @xmath131 : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is measured from the @xmath39-axis , and @xmath134 is a pauli - like operator , acting in particle - hole space . for the anti - parallel case , @xmath135 , we have , following from the operation of spin rotation above , the inverse property that only @xmath136 components can be induced . in addition",
    ", the pauli principle requires all triplet amplitudes to vanish at @xmath57 .",
    "we note also that with the usual phase convention taken here , namely that the singlet amplitude is real , the triplet amplitudes may have , and in general they do have , both real and imaginary parts .",
    "the results of triplet amplitudes shown here are calculated at zero temperature and are normalized to the singlet pair amplitude of a bulk s material .",
    "first , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the case of a thick s layer ( @xmath137 ) with two thin f layers ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the two f layers have exchange fields of identical magnitude , corresponding to @xmath89 , and the angle @xmath3 is varied .",
    "the dimensionless time chosen is @xmath138 , the behavior is characteristic of all times in the relevant range . of course",
    "the results at @xmath139 are found to vanish identically . as observed in this figure ,",
    "the results for @xmath136 vanish at @xmath125 and those for @xmath128 at @xmath140 in agreement with the conservation law restrictions .",
    "we see that the triplet amplitudes can be quite long ranged in s : this is evident , with our phase convention , for the imaginary parts of @xmath128 and @xmath136 at @xmath141 .",
    "thus the triplet correlations for this particular magnetization orientation can penetrate all the way to the other end of the s side , even though the s layer is three coherence lengths thick . in addition , one can see that antiparallel magnetizations in the f layers lead to both the real parts and the imaginary parts of @xmath136 being short ranged .",
    "non - collinear relative orientations of the exchange fields in the inner and outer f layers may induce both long range @xmath128 and @xmath136 components simultaneously .",
    "however , the triplet pairing correlations for @xmath108 are not as long ranged as those for @xmath141 .",
    "this can be indirectly attributed to much weaker singlet amplitudes inside s in the former case : the overall superconductivity scale is still set by the singlet , intrinsic correlations .",
    "considering now the real parts of @xmath128 and @xmath136 , and other than parallel and antiparallel magnetizations , the penetration of @xmath128 correlations within the ferromagnet regions is weakly dependent on the angle @xmath3 , while @xmath136 is more sensitive to @xmath3 . within the superconductor we see similar trends as for the imaginary parts except that the real components of @xmath136 and @xmath128 extend over a shorter distance within s at the same @xmath104 value .",
    "motivated by the long range triplet amplitudes found above for an @xmath17 structure with relatively thin f layers and a thick s layer , we discuss next , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the case of a thicker outer ferromagnet layer with @xmath142 , with @xmath143 .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows that the triplet amplitudes are more prominent in the f than in the s regions .",
    "there is also an underlying periodicity that is superimposed with apparent interference effects , with a shorter period than that found in the singlet pair amplitudes ( see bottom panel , fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "also , the imaginary component of @xmath128 penetrates the superconductor less than the imaginary @xmath136 component . for the real @xmath136 component ,",
    "the exchange field of the inner layer produces a valley near the interface in the f regions .",
    "this feature is most prominent when the exchange fields are anti - parallel , in which case the equal - spin triplet correlations are maximized . aside from this , the triplet amplitudes in s are smaller than in the case above with thicker s and thinner @xmath144 , although their range is not dissimilar .",
    "this is mainly because the triplet penetration into s is appreciably affected by finite size effects : when one of the f layers is relatively thick , it is only after a longer time delay @xmath104 that the triplet correlations evolve . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one can also see that the triplet @xmath128 correlations in s are nearly real ( i.e. in phase with the singlet ) and essentially independent of the angle @xmath3 .",
    "the triplet penetration is a function of the characteristic time @xmath104 scales .",
    "we therefore study the dependence of the triplet amplitudes on @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which shows results corresponding to @xmath107 , @xmath143 , @xmath141 , @xmath89 , and at four different values of @xmath104 .",
    "again , the triplet amplitudes , particularly their imaginary parts , are long range .",
    "the plots clearly show that at short times , @xmath145 , the triplet correlations generated at the interface reside mainly in the f region . at larger values of @xmath104 ,",
    "the triplet amplitudes penetrate more deeply into the s side , and eventually saturate . for the range of times shown",
    ", the magnitude of the real parts of @xmath128 and @xmath136 , decays in the s region near the interface due to the phase decoherence associated with conventional proximity effects .",
    "for the largest value of @xmath146 in the figure , the imaginary parts of @xmath128 and @xmath136 do not display monotonic decrease on the s side of the interface but saturate .",
    "this is because for these values of @xmath104 the triplet amplitudes already pervade the entire s. this indicates that both triplet components infiltrate the superconductor more efficiently and at smaller values of @xmath104 when they are nearly out of phase with the singlet amplitude .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of the triplet amplitudes on the magnitude of exchange field at a set time , @xmath138 .",
    "[ fig6 ] illustrates the real and imaginary parts of the complex @xmath128 ( left panels ) and @xmath136 ( right panels ) .",
    "the geometric parameters are @xmath107 , and @xmath143 , and we consider four different @xmath99 values at fixed relative orientation , @xmath141 . in our discussion",
    "below , we divide these four different values into two groups , the first including the two smaller values , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and the second the two somewhat larger ones , @xmath147 and @xmath89 . in each group ,",
    "the triplet amplitudes are similar in shape but different in magnitude .",
    "for the first group , there are no nodes at the @xmath113 interface for the @xmath128 components , while the @xmath136 components cross zero near it . for the second group ,",
    "the opposite occurs : the @xmath128 components cross zero while the @xmath136 components do not . also , the ratio of @xmath148 $ ] at @xmath117 to @xmath149 $ ] at @xmath116 is comparable to the ratio for the corresponding singlet amplitudes .",
    "this can be inferred , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , from the transition temperatures for @xmath116 , which are higher than @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , the transition temperatures for the first group are monotonically increasing with @xmath3 , while for the second group , they are non - monotonic functions with a minimum around @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath128 triplet amplitudes are indeed correlated with singlet amplitudes and the transition temperatures also reflect their behaviors indirectly .",
    "there is an interesting relationship involving the interplay between singlet and equal - spin triplet amplitudes : when @xmath2 is a non - monotonic function of @xmath3 , the singlet amplitudes ( which are directly correlated with @xmath2 ) at the angle where @xmath6 has a minimum are partly transformed into equal spin triplet amplitudes . by looking at the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one sees that the transition temperatures for @xmath147 and @xmath89 nearly overlap , while the @xmath116 case has a much higher transition temperature around @xmath108 .",
    "the singlet pair amplitudes ( at zero temperature ) follow the same trend as well : at @xmath116 , @xmath109 is much larger than the other pair amplitudes at different @xmath99 ( see the middle panel of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath136 component for these cases however , shows the opposite trend ( see , e.g. , the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) : for @xmath147 and @xmath89 , the equal spin correlations extend throughout the s region , but then abruptly plummet for @xmath116 .",
    "this inverse relationship between ordinary singlet correlations and @xmath136 is suggestive of singlet - triplet conversion for these particular magnetizations in each ferromagnet layer .",
    "having seen that the triplet amplitudes generated by the inhomogeneous magnetization can extend throughout the sample in a way that depends on @xmath104 , we proceed now to characterize their extension by determining a characteristic triplet proximity length .",
    "we calculate the characteristic lengths , @xmath150 , from our data for the triplet amplitudes , by using the same definition as in previous@xcite work : @xmath151 where the integration is either over the superconducting or the magnetic region .",
    "the normalization means that these lengths measure the range , not the magnitude , of the induced correlations . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show results for the four lengths thus obtained , for a sample with @xmath107 , @xmath143 and @xmath141 , at several values of @xmath99 .",
    "the left panels show these lengths for the @xmath128 component , and the right panels show the results for the corresponding @xmath136 component .",
    "the triplet penetration lengths in the @xmath76 region are completely saturated , even at smaller values of @xmath104 , for both @xmath128 and @xmath136 .",
    "this saturation follows only in part from the relatively thin f layers used for the calculations in this figure : the same saturation occurs for the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where @xmath152 , although of course at much larger values of @xmath150 . the triplet correlations easily pervade the magnetic part of the sample . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding penetration lengths for both triplet correlations , @xmath128 and @xmath136 , in the s region are substantially greater and , because @xmath153 is much larger , do not saturate but possess a peak around @xmath154 in all cases except for @xmath136 at lager @xmath99 where it is beyond the figure range .",
    "the behavior for the sample with larger f thicknesses is , on the s side , qualitatively similar .     vs @xmath3 , at @xmath155 .",
    "the three panels are for the same geometry and parameter values as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and the symbols have the same meaning . thus the top panel corresponds to @xmath107 and several values of @xmath99 , while the middle panel is for @xmath89 and several values of @xmath88 .",
    "the bottom panel corresponds to the reentrant case shown in the corresponding panel of fig .",
    "the inset shows the difference between truly reentrant cases and those for which the condensation energy is small ( see text ) in the range of @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]      given the self - consistent solutions , we are able to compute also the thermodynamic functions . in particular , we obtained the condensation free energies @xmath158 by using eq",
    ".  [ fe ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we plot calculated results for @xmath79 at zero @xmath159 , equivalent to the condensation energy .",
    "we normalize @xmath79 to @xmath160 , where @xmath161 denotes the density of states at the fermi level and @xmath162 denotes the bulk value of the singlet pair potential in s : thus we would have @xmath163 for pure bulk s. the three panels in this figure correspond to those in fig .",
    "the geometry is the same and the symbol meanings in each panel correspond to the same cases , for ease of comparison . in the top panel",
    ", we see that the @xmath79 curves for @xmath116 and @xmath117 are monotonically decreasing with @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to the monotonically increasing @xmath2 .",
    "one can conclude that the system becomes more superconducting when @xmath3 is changing from parallel to anti - parallel : the superconducting state is getting increasingly more favorable than the normal one as one increases the tilt from @xmath125 to @xmath140 .",
    "the other two curves in this panel , which correspond to @xmath147 and @xmath89 , show a maximum near @xmath157 .",
    "again , this is consistent with the transition temperatures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . comparing also with the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we see that the singlet amplitude for @xmath116 is much larger than that for the other values of @xmath99 .",
    "this is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] : @xmath79 is more negative at @xmath116 and the superconducting state is also more stable . the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows @xmath79 for different ferromagnet thicknesses .",
    "the curves are very similar to those in the top panel , just as the top two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] were found to be similar to each other .",
    "therefore , both fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , show that the superconducting states are thermodynamically more stable at @xmath135 than in the intermediate regions ( @xmath156 to @xmath157 ) . from the top two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we also see that @xmath79 at @xmath135 can be near @xmath164 in this geometry : this is a very large value , quite comparable to that in pure bulk s. however , in the region of the @xmath2 minima near @xmath165 , the absolute value of the condensation energy can be over an order of magnitude smaller , although it remains ( see below ) negative . the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows @xmath79 for the reentrant case previously presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for which @xmath120 and @xmath91 .",
    "the main plot shows the condensation energy results , which vanish at intermediate angles .",
    "because @xmath79 in the intermediate non - reentrant regions shown in the upper two panels can be very small , in the vertical scale shown , we have added to the lowest panel an inset where the two situations are contrasted . in the inset , the ( red ) plus signs represent @xmath79 for the truly reentrant case and the other three symbols have the same meaning as in the middle panel , where no reentrance occurs .",
    "the inset clearly shows the difference : @xmath79 vanishes in the intermediate region only for the reentrant @xmath2 case and remains slightly negative otherwise .",
    "the pair amplitudes for the reentrant region are found self - consistently to be identically zero .",
    "thus one can safely say that in the intermediate region the system must stay in the normal state and no self - consistent superconducting solution exists .",
    "evidence for reentrance with @xmath3 in @xmath20 is therefore found from both the microscopic pair amplitude and from @xmath2 : it is also confirmed thermodynamically . that superconductivity in @xmath0 trilayers can be reentrant with the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 layers , makes these systems ideal candidates for spin - valves .",
    "next , we present some results for the local dos ( ldos ) in @xmath20 systems .",
    "all plots are normalized to the corresponding value in a bulk sample of s material in its normal state .",
    "the top panels in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] show the normalized ldos integrated over the entire magnetic portion of the sample , while in the bottom panels the ldos is integrated over the s region . in all four cases we use @xmath107 , @xmath143 . in the left panels",
    "we have fixed @xmath89 and present results for several angles , while in the right panels we take a fixed @xmath141 and show results for several values of @xmath99 as indicated . in the top",
    "left panel ( f side ) we see no energy gap for any value of @xmath3 , however a flat valley between two peaks for the case @xmath166 resembles a characteristic feature of the dos in bulk superconductors .",
    "however , the plots at the other three angles , where the transition temperature and condensation energies are much lower , are very near the value of the dos in its normal state throughout all energies .",
    "this is also consistent with the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the cooper pair amplitudes in this case are larger inside f most significantly at @xmath166 .",
    "the singlet amplitudes at @xmath125 are also larger than in the other non - collinear configurations , but the superconducting feature in the ldos is not as prominent",
    ". this could be due to the contributions from the triplet pairing correlations : we know from the spin symmetry arguments discussed above that there is no @xmath136 component of the induced triplet amplitude at @xmath167 and therefore it can not enhance the superconducting feature in the dos . on the contrary , both singlet and triplet amplitudes can contribute when @xmath166 .",
    "thus the ldos results in the f side reflect the signature of induced triplet amplitudes in @xmath20 systems .",
    "the left bottom panel displays the integrated ldos over the entire s layers for the same parameters as the top one .",
    "again , the plot for @xmath166 , corresponding to the highest @xmath2 and most negative condensation energy , possesses a behavior similar to that in pure bulk s material , although the wide dip in the dos does not quite reach down to zero . on the other hand , the ldos at @xmath157 , the case with the most fragile superconductivity , has a shallow and narrow valley .",
    "the dos plots on the left side are very similar to the normal state result both at @xmath156 and at @xmath157 . in summary , the depth and the width of the dip are mostly correlated with the singlet pair amplitudes .",
    "the left panels also support our previous analysis : the slight difference between the normal states and superconducting states in the intermediate angle region is reflected in the dos .",
    "the right panels reveal how the magnetic strength parameter , @xmath99 , affects the integrated dos . as we can see from the middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the singlet cooper pair amplitudes for this case drop significantly when @xmath168 . the right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] confirm this information , that is the integrated doss in both the f and s sides have a very noticeable dip in the f side , and a near gap on the s region for @xmath116 , while for the other vaues of @xmath99 the eveidence for superconductivity in the dos is much less prominent .",
    "finally , it is also important to study the reverse proximity effects : not only can the superconductivity penetrate into the ferromagnets , but conversely the electrons in s near the interface can be spin polarized by the presence of the f layers .",
    "this introduction of magnetic order in s is accompanied by a corresponding decrease of the local local magnetization in @xmath37 near the s interface . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we show the components of the local magnetization , as defined in eq .  [ mm ] .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath107 , @xmath143 and @xmath89 and results are shown for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "the local magnetization results shown are normalized by @xmath169 , where @xmath170 and @xmath171 . from the figure one sees at once that both the sign and average magnitude of the @xmath172 and @xmath173 components inside the f material are in accordance with the values of the angle @xmath3 and of the exchange field ( @xmath89 ) . as to the reverse proximity effect",
    ", we indeed see a nonzero value of the local magnetization in s near the the interface .",
    "the penetration depth corresponding to this reverse effect is independent of @xmath3 . unlike the singlet and triplet amplitudes , which may spread throughout the entire structure ,",
    "the local magnetizations can only penetrate a short distance .",
    "this is consistent with results from past work@xcite .",
    "component ( top panel ) and the x component ( bottom panel ) of the local magnetization , plotted as a function of @xmath174 for several @xmath3 values .",
    "we use @xmath107 , @xmath143 , and @xmath89 in this figure . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in summary , we have investigated the proximity effects in @xmath0 trilayers by self - consistently solving the bdg equations .",
    "one of the most prominent features of these systems , which make them different from @xmath15 structures is the non - monotonicity of @xmath6 , as the angle , @xmath3 , between adjacent magnetizations is varied .",
    "for @xmath21 systems the critical temperature is always lowest for parallel ( @xmath175 ) orientations , due chiefly to the decreased average exchange field as @xmath3 increases and the two f s increasingly counteract one another .",
    "in contrast , we find that @xmath14 configurations can exhibit for particular combinations of exchange field strengths and layer thicknesses , critical temperatures that are lowest for relative magnetization orientations at an intermediate angle between the parallel and antiparallel configurations . in some cases",
    "the drop in @xmath2 from the parallel state , as @xmath3 is varied , is large enough that superconductivity is completely inhibited over a range of @xmath3 , and then reemerges again as @xmath3 increases : the system exhibits reentrant superconductivity with @xmath3 .",
    "we also calculated the singlet pair amplitude and condensation energies at zero temperature , revealing behavior that is entirely consistent with these findings .",
    "we have studied the odd triplet amplitudes that we find are generated , and found that both the opposite spin pairing ( with @xmath11 ) amplitude , @xmath128 , and the equal - spin pairing amplitude ( with @xmath126 ) , @xmath136 , can be induced by the inhomogeneous exchange fields in the f layers . also of importance",
    ", we have shown that the triplet pairing correlations can be very long ranged and extend throughout both the f and s regions , particularly for relatively thick s and f layers .",
    "we have characterized this penetration by calculating and analyzing properly defined characteristic lengths .",
    "we have also shown that the inner @xmath5 layer , when its exchange field is not aligned with that of the outer @xmath4 layer , plays an important role in generating the triplet amplitudes . when both magnets are thin , there is an indirect relationship between the singlet pairing amplitudes that govern @xmath2 and the @xmath136 amplitudes that govern the behavior of equal - spin pairing .",
    "we have also presented calculations of the energy resolved dos , spatially averaged over the s or f regions , demonstrating clear signatures in the energy spectra , which can be identified depending on the relative magnetization vectors in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 regions .",
    "we have determined that the extent of magnetic leakage into the s region as extracted from a calculation of the components of the local magnetization , is rather short ranged . throughout this paper , we have emphasized the potential of these structures as ideal candidates for spin valves .",
