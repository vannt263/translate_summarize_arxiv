    "the suppression of magnetism and appearance of superconductivity are associated with a structural transition from a high temperature tetragonal phase to a low temperature orthorhombic phase in both cuprates and pniticides .",
    "thus systems with magnetic and/or structural instabilities have been a fertile ground for looking for new superconductors",
    ". however , despite a tremendous effort in the last 30 years , the close interplay between magnetism , superconductivity , and structure and the mechanism mediating pairing are still under intense debate .    despite a low t@xmath6 @xmath7 2.08k,@xcite",

    "@xcite a previous study on the transport and magnetic properties under hydrostatic pressure up to 22kbar shows that t@xmath8 decreases while t@xmath6 increases with increasing pressure.@xcite this resembles the pressure dependence of t@xmath8 and t@xmath6 of v@xmath0si with the a15 structure and _ _ a__fe@xmath10as@xmath10 ( _ _ a__=ca , sr , and ba ) superconductors.@xcite moreover , a spin density wave state was suggested under high pressure that competes with superconductivity.@xcite while high pressure studies on high quality single crystals are needed to confirm the appearance of this spin density wave state , there is ample evidence supporting the close correlation between magnetism , structure , and superconductivity in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",

    "data analysis discussed below suggests that the interdimer interaction in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 is close to a critical value and essential for the occurrence of the structural transition .",
    "all dopants suppress superconductivity .",
    "our superconducting and cubic ru- and te - doped crystals show that the low - temperature tetragonal phase is not a prerequisite for the occurrence of superconductivity .",

    "the number of additional electrons is determined by integrating the density - of - states , which amounts to the assumption of rigid band behavior in the addition of dopants such as ru or te . for the purposes of determining the experimental doping levels of ru and te , each ru ( substituting for mo )",

    "the magnetic moment on cr ions was estimated to be 1.1@xmath29 @xmath30/cr by fitting the low - temperature cw tail .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the strong cw tail is inherent to the mo@xmath20cr@xmath21sb@xmath1 crystals and comes mainly from the isolated cr spins",
    ". the broken mo - mo dimers by the cr substituent may have a small contribution to the low temperature cw tail , as evidenced by the low temperature @xmath28 of mo@xmath2ru@xmath3sb@xmath1 .",

    "the x - ray diffraction experiments provide direct and unambiguous evidence for ( 1 ) the absence of the structural transition in mo@xmath0sb@xmath4te@xmath5 and mo@xmath2ru@xmath3sb@xmath1 , and ( 2 ) the suppression of structural transition to 48k in mo@xmath20cr@xmath21sb@xmath1 .",

    "however , no sign of the structure transition was observed above t@xmath6 for mo@xmath2ru@xmath3sb@xmath1 , where similar amount of mo is replaced by ru , from the temperature dependence of magnetization , specific heat , electrical resistivity ( not shown ) , and x - ray diffraction .",
    "therefore , disturbing the mo - sublattice by substitution at mo - site does not drive the suppression of the structure transition in mo@xmath37sb@xmath1 .",

    "substitution of sb by te does nt disturb the mo - sublattice directly .",

    "considering both dopants introduce additional electrons , we suggest that the structural transition is sensitive to electron concentration .",
    "a band jahn - teller effect was proposed to induce the structural instability in cubic superconductors such as a15 compounds.@xcite however , our band structure calculations for te and ru doped compositions suggest that light doping induces little change of the degeneracy and curvature of the valence bands , consistent with previous reports.@xcite thus a band jahn - teller effect is unlikely to drive the structural transition in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 . the density - of - states with doping",
