    "the pfc may be derived from the ddft by assuming a ( local ) gradient expansion approximation for the helmholtz free energy functional for the system and linearizing the density - dependent mobility pre - factor in the ddft equation @xcite .",
    "dft and ddft are theories for the one body density distribution @xmath1 of the particles in the system .",
    "these theories essentially treat the solid phase as an inhomogeneous liquid , in which the density profile consists of an array of density peaks , each corresponding to a localized particle , in contrast to the liquid phase which has a uniform density distribution .",

    ", the amplitude of the oscillations in the tail of @xmath177 grows , indicating that the system is rearranging to form a much more ordered system with the particle locations being well correlated over larger distances . the larger amount of disorder shortly after a deep quench is a consequence of the mismatch between the wavelength selected dynamically by the advancing solidification front and the equilibrium lattice spacing of the crystalline solid",
    "this mismatch increases with increasing @xmath96 .",

    "both approaches the solid phase is represented as a spatially structured state with local maxima in the density profile @xmath1 or equivalently the order parameter @xmath2 representing the time - averaged location of individual atoms / particles .",
    "the present approach is thus able to bridge purely continuum or macroscopic solidification theory @xcite with atomistic approaches such as molecular dynamics . despite this fundamental difference ,",
    "the ddft and pfc models that result can still be formulated in terms of partial differential equations .",
    "these may be nonlocal as in ddft or local as in pfc .",
    "knowledge of the dispersion relation suffices for the computation of the speed of the solidification front when this speed is selected by linear processes , i.e. , in situations where the growth of the perturbations behind the front compensates for the propagation of the front , resulting in a steadily advancing front of constant shape .",
    "however , in some problems the speed of the front may instead be determined by nonlinear processes @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is essential to compare the prediction obtained from the linear marginal stability criterion employed here in the form of eqs .",

    "such simulations yield in addition important information about processes occurring on longer time scales than the propagation time .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows . for small undercooling , as measured by the parameter @xmath96 , the advancing front selects wavelengths close to the equilibrium wavelength @xmath15 of the crystalline solid , resulting in steady transformation of the liquid state into solid .",
    "the front speed is @xmath188 . for large undercooling ( i.e. , supercooling ) the front speed is faster and follows the approximate relation @xmath189 . in this regime",
    "the wavelength selected by the advancing front differs substantially from @xmath15 resulting in a nonequilibrium structure that subsequently evolves on a longer time scale , first via an instability to a hexagonal structure and subsequently via slow defect migration and annihilation .",
    "this ` ageing ' process consists of rearrangements as the system seeks to anneal out the defects and differently orientated domain structures which frustrate the formation of a regular crystal with wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "we have also found that the initial perturbation imprinted on the advancing front may have a significant effect on the manifestation of the instability of the stripe state with respect to hexagonal perturbations .",
    "since this transverse scale will also differ from the optimal scale @xmath109 its presence provides an additional source of frustration following the passage of the front . although these results were obtained using the pfc model , analogous two - dimensional calculations based on a ddft model yield very similar results ( not shown ) .",
    "an important issue that we must mention concerns the extent to which insights from the pfc model can be applied to solidification in real materials .",
    "the transition in the pfc model from uniform to modulated phase is weakly first order , stemming from a truncated gradient expansion approximation to obtain the pfc free energy functional in eq .",
    "( see also eq .   in appendix",
    "a ) . the fact that for some values of @xmath105 the pfc model exhibits a stripe phase that is not seen in real atomic fluids is an indication that the truncated gradient expansion approximation has failed for these @xmath105 values @xcite .",

    ", the approach described above appears to be valid .",
