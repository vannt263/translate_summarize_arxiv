    "the role of correlated two - pion exchange in the interaction of two nucleons is well - established @xcite , with the bulk of the intermediate range attraction due to the scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath3-meson ) channel .",
    "this same mechanism is presumably responsible for most of the attraction between nucleons in nuclei , despite the possibly strong influence of the nuclear medium on the @xmath0 correlations @xcite , especially in the @xmath3-channel @xcite .",
    "there the coupling of pions to nucleons and @xmath4 s enhances the attraction of the pions at energies near the 2@xmath5 threshold , which can lead to quasi - bound states , and even to @xmath0 @xmath1-wave pair condensation at relatively low densities @xcite .    in a recent study aouissat _",
    "@xcite , hereafter referred to as i , demonstrated the unattractive possibility of @xmath0 pair condensation at nuclear densities of 1.2 - 1.3@xmath6 ( @xmath7 , normal nuclear matter density ) for two phenomenological models @xcite which fit @xmath0 s - wave phases over a broad energy range .",
    "it was also found in i that the tendency towards @xmath0 pair condensation appeared to be dramatically suppressed if the @xmath0 amplitude were forced to satisfy a constraint required by chiral symmetry , which is that the amplitude must satisfy the so - called soft - pion theorems @xcite .",
    "implicit in this constraint is that the @xmath0 s - wave scattering lengths be proportional to the pion mass as the pion mass approaches zero .",
    "their study immediately suggests two questions : ( 1 ) does the imposition of the chiral constraint on the amplitude provide a guarantee against @xmath0 pair condensation in the nuclear medium at low or moderate density ? ( 2 ) how can one construct interactions based on meson - exchange models which are unitary and which satisfy the soft - pion theorems without recourse to reformulating the treatment of pions in nuclear matter @xcite ?",
    "we will address these questions in reverse order and first derive a simple prescription for how to construct pseudopotentials in which the scattering length constraint is guaranteed .",
    "having done this , we will examine reasons why meson - exchange models can not follow the prescription and then address the problem of sufficiency posed in the first question .",
    "the difficulty in imposing the constraint on the scattering lengths , hereafter called the minimal chiral constraint , or mcc , is that the @xmath0 amplitudes used in the in - medium calculations are generated from an interaction kernel which is unitarized by means of a scattering equation ( _ e.g. _ , the blankenbecler - sugar equation @xcite ) . in that case ,",
    "any symmetries of the interaction kernel are usually destroyed by iteration in the scattering equation .",
    "this is a well known result . in meson - exchange models , for example",
    ", the interaction kernel is the born amplitude of an effective field - theoretic lagrangian , which is crossing - symmetric . solving the scattering equation",
    "effectively sums a subset ( ladder / bubble graphs ) of the full set of feynman diagrams , thereby destroying the crossing symmetry of the kernel . in the same way an interaction kernel which is chirally symmetric in the limit of zero pion mass results in an amplitude in which this property is lost through iteration in the scattering equation .",
    "were the objective simply to calculate scattering amplitudes for pions at zero density , the problem of preserving ( broken ) chiral ( and crossing ) symmetry is solved , in principle , by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "however calculations in chiral perturbation theory beyond one loop are overwhelming , so that unitarity can not easily be enforced , nor can one readily adapt the method to the problem of pion interactions in the nuclear medium . for practical reasons",
    "we are led back to effective models used with scattering equations .",
    "the problem of enforcing the mcc was solved in i by using a once - subtracted form of the 2-pion propagator in the blankenbecler - sugar ( bbs ) equation @xcite , taking the subtraction point at @xmath8 ( @xmath1 is the square of the center - of - mass energy ) and setting the subtraction constant to zero . for free particle scattering ,",
    "this resulted in the replacement of the bbs propagator @xmath9 by the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the modulus of the c.m .",
    "3-momentum of the pions and @xmath12 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath1 in the numerator of @xmath13 as an _ external _ variable in the integral equation ensures that the scattering amplitude generated by solving the bbs equation ( quantum numbers suppressed ) @xmath14 will be @xmath15 if @xmath16 is @xmath15 as @xmath17 , assuming that the integration over intermediate momenta gives a factor of @xmath18 or higher . since the scattering length in the @xmath19-th channel ( where @xmath19 stands for ( @xmath20 ) or ( @xmath21 ) ) is given by    @xmath22    with @xmath23 , if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 and the mcc is fulfilled .",
    "the difficulty with this solution is that the suppression of the rescattering terms at small momenta forces one to use large coupling constants and unrealistically high values of cutoffs , and to rely on heavy meson - exchange ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath26(1270 ) ) , in meson exchange models such as the jlich model @xcite in order to achieve a good fit to @xmath0 phase shifts , so that one loses contact with the underlying low - energy physics of the @xmath27 interaction . here",
    "we wish to construct interaction kernels which will yield amplitudes which satisfy the mcc without having to resort to the subtraction scheme of i , and thereby avoid its unattractive features . in that sense , this is a continuation of the work begun in i. for that reason we will adopt the same model for renormalizing the single - pion propagator in nuclear matter as in that work . since the model is described in detail in i , we will not repeat it here .    the solution to building the mcc into the interaction kernel",
    "is quite straightforward .",
    "we noted earlier that the reason the subtracted form of the 2-pion propagator preserved the scattering length constraint contained in the interaction kernel is that @xmath28 the square of the center - of - mass energy , appears as an _ external _ variable in the rescattering term in the integral equation , eq .",
    "( [ bbs ] ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath29 is @xmath15 as @xmath30 , the same will hold for @xmath31 .",
    "if the kernel is such that it always contains _ external _ kinematic factors which are each @xmath15 or higher at each stage in the _ iterative _ solution of the scattering equation , then the mcc will be satisfied .",
    "one simple way to accomplish this is through the use of separable potentials .",
    "if @xmath16 is a sum of terms of the form @xmath32 such that @xmath33 is @xmath34 ( or higher ) as @xmath35 the amplitude will be @xmath36 and the mcc will be fulfilled .",
    "this property was exploited in i with the linear @xmath3-model .",
    "they started from the @xmath37 born amplitude in the linear @xmath3-model , @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the usual mandelstam variables for _ physical _ processes given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 the incoming and @xmath44 the outgoing pion 4-momenta .    in order to construct a separable potential",
    ", they took the off - shell continuation of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 to be @xmath45 corresponding to placing the pions on the mass shell ( @xmath46 ) in @xmath47 and @xmath48 , but taking @xmath1 as an external variable in the scattering equation . neglecting the @xmath47 and @xmath41 in the denominators as being small compared with @xmath49 , the interaction kernel becomes    @xmath50    here @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the moduli of @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a dipole - type form factor with @xmath56 to insure convergence of the integral .",
    "clearly the interaction defined in eq .",
    "( [ sepsigma ] ) satisfies the criteria for mcc set out above : every term contains either an external factor ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) or a factor which is a product of terms ( @xmath59 ) which survive the integration and are @xmath60 as @xmath17 .",
    "notice , however , that separability of the potential is not a crucial part of the recipe for ensuring mcc .",
    "if it were , then all meson - exchange models would be irreparable .",
    "the important point is that all the terms in the potential have in their numerators products of factors which are of order @xmath61 in the chiral limit , one of which depends only on the initial momentum and the other only on the final momentum .",
    "were the @xmath47- and of the denominators retained in defining @xmath62 , the mcc would still be satisfied .",
    "this is evident if one writes the scattering equation in iterated form ( schematically ) : @xmath63 every term in the series will contain one factor which depends on the initial momentum , and one which depends on the final momentum .",
    "as long as the integrals implied in the equation are @xmath18 or higher ( the form factors used in the potential guarantee this ) , the mcc is satisfied by @xmath64 .",
    "thus , it is the choice of off - shell continuation of the kinematic variables , and not separability , which is crucial to preserving the scattering length constraint .",
    "observe also that the choice of off - shell continuation is not unique .",
    "we could have taken @xmath65 and still fulfilled the prescription for satisfying the mcc .",
    "the choice @xmath66 is made on physical grounds : we want the @xmath3-meson to appear as a fixed pole in energy in the scattering channel .",
    "a generalization of the prescription for construction of an mcc - preserving potential is now clear :    1 .",
    "start with an on - shell born amplitude derived from a chirally symmetric lagrangian ( broken by the pion mass term ) , expressing it in terms of the mandelstam variables in crossing - symmetric form .",
    "make the off - shell continuation of @xmath1 , @xmath47 , and @xmath41 as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ offshell1 ] ) .",
    "3 .   include form factors , as necessary , to insure convergence of the rescattering term",
    ".    we will refer to potentials of this type as mcc quasi - separable .",
    "of course , the above prescription is sufficient , but not necessary .",
    "it is certainly possible that potentials can be constructed which are not of this type but which , through a delicate cancellation of terms , do fulfill the mcc .",
    "nevertheless , the prescription allows us to define , for any underlying effective lagrangian which is ( broken ) chirally symmetric , a potential which will yield an amplitude that has the proper behavior of the scattering lengths .",
    "although the prescription above guarantees mcc - compliance of the interaction kernel , it is neither unique , nor free from inconsistencies which seem to be unavoidable .",
    "we have already alluded indirectly to such inconsistencies in our discussion above of the relation of the continuation of the mandelstam variables via eq .",
    "( [ offshell2 ] ) to the bbs equation .",
    "these appear to arise whenever one uses an effective lagrangian to generate a born term to use in a scattering equation ; that is , the off - shell continuation needed to satisfy the mcc is not derivable from the evaluation of interaction vertices based on a lagrangian used consistently with a scattering equation .",
    "we illustrate this with a common example : the exchange of a @xmath67-meson .",
    "the interaction term in the lagrangian is @xmath68 the @xmath37 and @xmath69 born amplitudes contain @xmath47- and @xmath41-channel exchange terms which are given by @xmath70.\\ ] ] we have omitted the contributions arising from gauge terms in the @xmath67 propagator , since they vanish for the fully on - shell , equal - mass born amplitude , and they are usually neglected in the meson - exchange potentials as well . in that case",
    "the amplitude , expressed in manifestly crossing - symmetric form , is @xmath71 let us examine this potential as evaluated _ consistently _ in the bbs approach , and then in time - ordered perturbation theory .    in the bbs approach ,",
    "the interaction is instantaneous , so that only 3-momentum is transferred in the exchange of the meson .",
    "thus the scattering particles remain on the energy shell , but not on the mass shell . in the c.m .",
    "frame @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in terms of these variables ,",
    "[ rhob ] becomes @xmath74 this form can be obtained from the off - shell continuation of @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath41 @xmath77 applied to eq .",
    "( [ rhob2 ] ) .",
    "this , therefore , is the `` natural '' or consistent off - shell continuation of the mandelstam variables in the bbs approach .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath78 and @xmath79 standing separately violates the requirements of mcc quasi - separability . in time - ordered perturbation theory , the scattering particles are on the mass shell , but off the energy shell .",
    "the lagrangian gives one the interactions at the vertices ( the numerators ) and the denominators arise from the normalization of the @xmath67-meson wave function . in this case @xmath80 and @xmath81 , yielding @xmath82 as in the bbs approach , the interaction will not preserve the mcc .",
    "thus , in order to fulfill the mcc , one can not simply use interaction vertices given by the consistent use of a meson - exchange lagrangian in conjunction with one or another scattering equation .",
    "one can see that the @xmath83 vertices for @xmath47- and @xmath41-channel exchange will _ always _ have terms in which @xmath78 and @xmath79 appear as a sum , and therefore destroy any possibility for the interaction to be mcc quasi - separable .",
    "to construct one which is , one must start with the fully on - shell amplitude expressed in manifestly crossing - symmetric form , _",
    "e.g. _ eq .  ( [ rhob2 ] ) , and continue the kinematic variables off shell according to the prescription of section 2.2  or some similar one  in which each term in the numerator is either an external energy or mass squared , or is a product of an initial energy or momentum and a final one .",
    "in this section we will examine the results of two models in which the potential is constructed according to the prescription in section 2 .",
    "the results will be compared with those for the same models when a frequently - used off - shell continuation which violates mcc quasi - separability is used .",
    "we choose the linear @xmath3-model as a first example . in this case",
    "we retain the @xmath47- and @xmath41-dependence arising from the exchange of @xmath3 mesons in the crossed channels .",
    "the fit to the @xmath84=00 @xmath85 phase shifts is displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "the parameters and form factors used for this model are shown in table i. the in - medium results , shown in the upper panel of fig",
    ".  2 , are quite similar to those of i and confirm the notion that separability is not the crucial property of the potential .",
    "( the definition of @xmath64 differs from that of i by a factor @xmath86 . )",
    "the amplitude shows no tendency towards pair condensation , and there is hardly any invasion of strength into the subthreshold region even at densities as high as 2@xmath87 .    in order to demonstrate the consequences of violation of the mcc",
    ", we use the same model , but with the off - shell continuation given by eq .",
    "( [ offshell2 ] ) , the natural one for the bbs reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation , wherein the intermediate pions are on the energy shell , but off the mass shell .",
    "the occurrence in @xmath47 and @xmath41 of @xmath78 and @xmath79 standing separately spoil the mcc quasi - separability of the potential and result in a contribution from the rescattering integral which is @xmath18 in the chiral limit .",
    "results for this model are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "note that at zero density the amplitude for this model and for the previous one are very close without having changed the parameters .",
    "( this good agreement , however , relies on choosing a rather small bare @xmath3-mass @xmath88 , which allows for a small cutoff parameter @xmath89 ; for higher @xmath3 masses , which require higher cutoffs for fitting the @xmath1-wave phase shifts , the different off - shell behavior of eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and  ( 14 ) induces larger differences . ) at higher densities , however , one clearly recognizes a much stronger accumulation of strength below the 2@xmath5 threshold compared to the model including the mcc ( compare upper panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , although there is no pair instability in either case at these densities .",
    "while the linear @xmath3-model is instructive , we wish to examine the results for a model which achieves a quantitatively better fit to elastic @xmath0 data : the jlich model  @xcite , which is based on explicit meson exchange . in order",
    "that the born amplitude satisfies the soft - pion theorems we here include contact terms in the lagrangian that arise from a proper gauging procedure of the non - linear @xmath3 model  @xcite .",
    "to further ensure the mcc we employ the on - mass - shell prescription , eq .",
    "( 7 ) , for the off - shell continuation of the pseudopotentials . with some readjustment of the meson exchange parameters and typical cutoff parameters",
    "@xmath90  mev for the additionally introduced contact terms ( compare table 2 ) a good overall fit to the @xmath85 scattering data can be obtained for c.m .",
    "energies well beyond 1  gev ( see fig .  3 ) . by construction ,",
    "the @xmath1-wave scattering lengths vanish in the chiral limit ( upper panel of fig .  4 ) .",
    "the density dependence of the amplitude in the @xmath84=00-channel is displayed in fig .  5 ( upper panel ) .",
    "in contrast to the bbs - jlich model employed in i ( without contact interactions and without mcc ) , in which condensation occurred just above @xmath91 , our chirally improved model shows a somewhat weaker tendency towards instability ; as a consequence of the additional repulsion induced by the contact interactions , the critical density for condensation is pushed up to approximately 1.4@xmath91 , with a moderate portion of strength absorbed in the condensing peak .",
    "the critical density can be increased to approximately 2@xmath91 with a relatively small increase in the cutoff mass for the contact terms while retaining a good fit to the phase shift .",
    "thus the conjecture that an interaction which produces an amplitude that satisfies the mcc would eliminate the pair condensation instability is not correct , even though it appears to work in that direction .    to examine the impact of the mcc in more detail , we replace the on - mass - shell prescription for the mandelstam variables , eq .",
    "( 7 ) , by the bbs ( on - energy - shell ) identification , eq .",
    ". a slight readjustment of some parameters is necessary to obtain an overall fit to the @xmath85 phase shifts of similar quality to that of fig .  3 ( see also table 3 ) , although the cutoffs for the contact terms are kept fixed .",
    "the results are presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "the contrast with the previous case is significant .",
    "condensation density is slightly higher  about 1.5@xmath91  and can easily be increased to above 2@xmath91 with a small increase of the contact term cutoffs .",
    "the accumulation of strength in the condensing peaks is very much smaller than in the previous case and similar to that found for the jlich model with chiral constraints investigated in i. the scattering lengths as a function of pion mass ( lower panel of fig .",
    "4 ) show clearly the violation of the chiral constraints for this model .",
    "therefore the conjecture in i that scattering length constraint insures against pair condensation at low - to - moderate density appears to be neither sufficient nor necessary .",
    "that is not to say that chiral invariance is unimportant .",
    "the `` improvements '' in the jlich model are just those which make the kernel satisfy the soft - pion theorems .",
    "what is clear now is that the suppression of the instability is due in large part to the change in the kernel ; there is no necessity to redefine the 2-pion propagator in order to avoid the instability at near - nuclear density .",
    "one must simply be careful in constructing the kernel to build in enough repulsion at sub - threshold energy to suppress the tendency towards @xmath0 bound state formation .",
    "the results are somewhat sensitive to the off - shell continuation of the kinematic variables , but this sensitivity can largely be compensated by readjustment of parameters in standard models .",
    "one other difference between the mcc - compliant and bbs cases is worthy of mention . despite the earlier onset of the pairing instability ,",
    "the mcc - compliant amplitude actually shows considerably less strength in the near sub - threshold region , @xmath92 , than the bbs case .",
    "this means that at normal nuclear matter density the range of the in - medium nucleon - nucleon interaction will be less affected in the mcc case than in the bbs .",
    "since the effects are highly non - linear with density , they are very model - dependent , not only on the @xmath0 interaction , but also on the approximations underlying the many - body aspects of the calculation . conclusions concerning the range of the nucleon - nucleon interaction must be made with extreme care .",
    "nevertheless , the question of whether the chiral constraint in some way `` protects '' the range of the nucleon - nucleon force up to nuclear matter density is worthy of further study .",
    "we have given a general prescription for the construction of @xmath0 potentials for scattering equations which enforces constraints on the scattering lengths in the limit of zero pion mass , in accordance with the requirements of chiral symmetry . when used in a particular scattering equation",
    ", the constrained amplitudes do not automatically ensure that the @xmath0 interaction in nuclear matter will be stable against @xmath0 bound state formation at low - to - moderate density .",
    "the imposition of the scattering length constraint on the kernel does delay the onset of the instability to higher densities , however ; imposition of the constraint on the full amplitude appears especially effective in suppressing the @xmath0 interaction strength in the near sub - threshold region .    due to the complexity of the calculation and the non - linearity of the in - medium effects , it is difficult to make very general quantitative statements about the interactions of pions in the nuclear medium . based on our limited investigations it appears that commonly employed models of the @xmath0 interactions , adjusted to satisfy the soft - pion theorems , do not necessarily lead to instabilities when carried over to in - medium calculations .",
    "small adjustments in model parameters allow one simultaneously to fit @xmath0 scattering phases and to avoid the pairing instability at densities below approximately 2@xmath91 .",
    "reformulation of the 2-pion propagator , which is essentially a definition of a new scattering equation , is not necessary . finally , there are numerical indications that chiral constraints play a significant part in our understanding of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in the nuclear medium , but exactly what that part is remains a subject for further investigation .",
