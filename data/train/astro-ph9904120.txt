    "a great deal of effort has been devoted in recent times to the dynamics of scalar fields in the radiation and matter dominated era .",
    "the motivations are manyfold : first , several theories of fundamental physics predict the existence of scalar fields @xcite@xcite@xcite ; second , a slowly rolling scalar field may mimic the behavior of a cosmological constant at the present time , in agreement with a popular model of structure formation and with the observation of an accelerated space expansion @xcite@xcite@xcite ; third , the scalar field may alleviate the constraints on a true cosmological constant @xcite ; fourth , the additional source of fluctuations produced by the scalar field may give new observable effects on the cosmic microwave background and on the structure formation @xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "so far , most work focused on fields with minimal coupling to gravity @xcite@xcite@xcite",
    "@xcite@xcite @xcite . in this case , the dynamics in a homogeneous and isotropic space - time is completely determined once one specifies the matter fluid equation of state and the field potential . for the former ,",
    "the obvious choices of interest are the equation of state of a relativistic fluid and of a pressureless one . for the latter , although there are no observations or fundamental principles to guide our investigation , potentials like power - laws , exponential and a handful of other cases have been selected , basing either on simplicity or on some particle physics model . among the infinite solutions of the system of equations ,",
    "the attractor solutions are of course of the greatest interest . among the attractors , those which have a power - law behavior ,",
    "denoted also as scaling solutions , are particularly simple to find and to study .",
    "consequently , the study of the scalar field dynamics has focussed on the search of _ scaling attractors_. to be interesting for cosmological purposes , these attractor solutions must also lead to a energy density in the scalar field which is a non - negligible fraction of the total energy density .",
    "finally , if we want to explain recent observations of the large - scale geometry of the space - time @xcite@xcite , the scalar factor has to be accelerated at the present .    in minimal coupling theories",
    "the lagrangian is the sum of the einstein - hilbert gravity lagrangian and of the scalar field sector .",
    "the non - minimal coupling ( nmc ) adds a new term which , in its simplest form , may be written as ( for a more general form that includes derivatives see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath1 for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite adopted @xmath2 discussing the model in the context of inflation . in ref .",
    "@xcite several attractor scaling solutions in the matter dominated regime with power - law and exponential potential have been found .",
    "other forms of @xmath3 have been considered ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    a common feature of all these investigations , perhaps obviously , is the choice of specific potentials and coupling functions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible to find attractor solutions in nmc models in which both the coupling @xmath3 and the potential @xmath4 are left unspecified , and only their relation matters . in other words , we will find a class of models in which the dynamics of the system is independent of the coupling and of the potential , and depends only on their relation .",
    "in particular , we will find attractor solutions for all models for which we can write @xcite @xmath5 this relation holds , for instance , when both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are power - law , or exponential , but is also valid for much more complicated functions , like products of power law and exponential . in the limit of strong coupling ,",
    "the dynamics of the cosmological solution will be shown to depend essentially only on @xmath8 and on the fluid matter equation of state .",
    "after performing a conformal rescaling of the metric , the nmc system is written as a scalar field in pure general relativity with an exponential potential and an extra coupling to the ordinary matter ( see e.g. @xcite , in which however only the case @xmath9 has been discussed ) .",
    "this system shows a surprisingly rich phase space structure , with four different attractors .",
    "two of these are qualitatively similar to the attractors found in the system without extra coupling .",
    "the other two however are new , and have not been previously identified .",
    "although we derived this system from a class of nmc theories , we remark that it is interesting on its own , and many cosmological properties of its trajectories have yet to be worked out . here",
    "we study it mainly to constrain the nmc model , and find that the constraint on the variability of the gravitational constant rules out this class of models as explanation for the accelerated expansion rate of the universe .    in the next section we work out the field equations . in section 3",
    "we find and discuss the attractor solutions , in section 4 we discuss their cosmological properties , and in the final section we draw the conclusion and point to new developments .",
    "consider the lagrangian of a nmc scalar field plus a perfect fluid matter component ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 contrary to the usual notation , we found convenient to include into @xmath12 the constant that produces the einstein - hilbert term , so that our @xmath7 is @xmath13 in the notation of , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "we will always assume @xmath14 , since it acts as an effective gravitational constant , @xmath15    the einstein equations are @xmath16 , \\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes here @xmath18 , and where the scalar field energy - momentum tensor is @xmath19 and the fluid tensor is @xmath20    now , under the conformal transformation @xmath21 the following transformations ( see e .g .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite ) occur : the kinetic term @xmath22 remains invaried ( @xmath23 ) ; the potential term @xmath24 becomes @xmath25 ; and the perfect fluid tensor becomes @xmath26 putting @xmath27 it follows that the equations in the rescaled metric ( sometimes called einstein frame , while the old metric is the jordan frame ) are @xmath28 , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 where @xmath30 and where the prime denotes derivation with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "we can then define a new canonical field @xmath32 a new potential @xmath33 and a new matter tensor @xmath34 finally , all these definitions lead to the canonical equations in the new metric @xmath35 @xmath36 .\\ ] ] the new matter energy - momentum tensor can be written as @xmath37 as a last step , we rewrite the new metric in the friedmannian form @xmath38 where the old time and the old scale factor are @xmath39 and @xmath40 the equation of motion for the fields are obtained as the covariant conservation laws of the energy tensors . in the old frame they read @xmath41 the transformation to the new frame is performed according to the rules @xmath42 from now on , we omit all the tilde , until we return to the original quantities .",
    "finally , the full set of equations in the friedmann metric read : @xmath43 where @xmath44 as already remarked in the introduction , the system ( [ sys1]-[sys4 ] ) , here derived from a nmc model , is interesting on its own .",
    "indeed , we can regard either the jordan or the einstein frame as the physical one . in the former case",
    ", we have to express the solutions of the above system back in the original frame , and study its cosmological consequences in the original frame , as we will do below . in the latter case ,",
    "the solutions of the system are the physical solutions , and their properties can be directly compared to observations . in particular , the constraints from the variability of @xmath0 , which we will find to limit heavily the cosmological viability of our solutions , apply only assuming the physical frame to be the original jordan one .",
    "the full dynamics of the system ( [ sys1]-[sys4 ] ) is specified by the potential @xmath45 and by the equation of state @xmath46 . in the following we consider only @xmath47 . to write down the potential @xmath48 , we have first to find the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath31 .",
    "this is where the possibility of a dynamics independent of the potential and of the coupling function arises .",
    "in fact , if we assume that @xcite @xmath50 then we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ fphi ] ) : @xmath51 it follows @xmath52 where the integration constant can be absorbed into a redefinition of @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that the conformal function @xmath53 equals @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , once we have the dynamics of @xmath49 in the transformed metric , we can write down the solution in terms of the original metric without having to specify @xmath55 provided we express also the potential @xmath56 as a function of @xmath3 . with the assumption ( [ condf ] ) we get @xmath57 in the system ( [ sys1]-[sys4 ] ) , so that putting @xmath58 the first two equations become @xmath59    the condition ( [ condf ] ) holds true in several cases .",
    "for instance , it is verified for large @xmath31 by any function @xmath3 which grows faster than quadratically , that is @xmath60 . in the often - studied quadratic case , @xmath61 , for large @xmath31 we can put @xmath62 .",
    "then , instead of eq .",
    "( [ condf ] ) , one has @xmath63 , and all that changes is that in eq .",
    "( [ fdef ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ psif ] ) @xmath64 is replaced by @xmath65 . in this case , all the results found below become _",
    "exact_. the weak coupling limit in which @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 , on the other hand , is excluded in the present analysis .",
    "we could then label our case as the _ strong coupling _ limit .",
    "in fact , it is easily seen that it corresponds to the limit in which the lagrangian can be approximated as @xmath68 , neglecting the kinetic term @xmath69 .",
    "notice however that this does not imply that the scalar field kinetic terms in the field equations are negligible , because the non - minimal coupling itself introduces other kinetic terms .",
    "now , as anticipated , suppose we can write @xmath70 .the potential becomes then @xmath71 where @xmath72 therefore , the potential can be written as an exponential , whatever the shape of @xmath6 and of @xmath7 , provided that the condition ( [ condf ] ) and the relation ( [ condp ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "the sign of @xmath73 selects the direction in which the field @xmath49 , and thus the variable @xmath7 , rolls . if @xmath74 , @xmath49 rolls toward @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 , and the effective gravitational constant @xmath77 increases with time . in the opposite case , @xmath78 , we have that @xmath77 decreases in the future .",
    "we emphasize that if @xmath3 is quadratic , then all results below remain valid provided @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath79 and @xmath80 by @xmath81    the scalar field dynamics in nmc theories is then reduced to the scalar field dynamics in pure general relativity with an exponential potential and with a scalar field / matter coupling . in the radiation case in which @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 , and the source terms decouple .",
    "the decoupling occurs also when we can neglect the matter energy density @xmath84 with respect to the scalar field energy density @xmath85 . in these cases , the problem is identical to that already solved in , e.g. , ref .",
    "the case @xmath86 has been already discussed by wetterich in @xcite , where some of its attractors have been identified . here",
    "we extend the analysis to the full classification of critical points and attractors ( finding two new attractors ) and express the solutions in terms of the old frame .",
    "we keep @xmath87 as an independent parameter as long as possible , and proceed to replacing it by @xmath88 only in the graphics , in order to narrow the parameter space to two dimensions , namely @xmath89 and @xmath73 .",
    "the formulas apply however to the more general case , unless otherwise specified .    following copeland et al .",
    "@xcite we define @xmath90 and introduce the independent variable @xmath91 . notice that @xmath92 and @xmath93 give the fraction of total energy density carried by the scalar field kinetic and potential energy , respectively .",
    "then , we can rewrite the system ( [ sys1]-[sys4 ] ) as @xmath94 -\\mu y^2+\\frac 12   \\beta ( 1-x^2-y^2 ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "y^{\\prime } & = & \\mu xy+3y\\left [ x^2+\\frac 12w(1-x^2-y^2)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{syst2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime is here @xmath95 .",
    "the system is invariant under the change of sign of @xmath96 and of @xmath97 .",
    "since it is also limited by the condition @xmath98 to the circle @xmath99 , we may study only the unitary semicircle of positive @xmath96 .",
    "the critical points , those that verify @xmath100 , are scaling solutions , on which the scalar field equation of state is @xmath101 the scalar field total energy density is @xmath102 , and the scale factor is @xmath103\\ ] ] ( the slope @xmath104 is not to be confused with the pressure ) .",
    "copeland et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the system ( [ syst2 ] ) with @xmath105 and an exponential potential has up to five critical points , that can be classified according to the dominant energy density : one dominated by the scalar field total energy density ( let us label this point as solution @xmath106 and refer to its coordinates as @xmath107 ) , one in which the fractions of energy density in the matter and in the field are both non - zero ( labelled @xmath108 ) , one dominated by the matter field ( @xmath109 ) , and finally two dominated by the kinetic energy of the scalar field , of which one at @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) and one at @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the critical points on which the matter field becomes negligible reduce to the @xmath83 case : therefore , the solutions @xmath114 @xmath111 , and @xmath113 remain the same also for @xmath115 the points @xmath108 and @xmath109 are instead modified .",
    "the solution @xmath109 is no longer matter dominated : rather , the scalar field kinetic energy and the matter energy take up a constant fraction of the total energy . in mde ,",
    "the scalar field kinetic energy amounts to @xmath116 the critical points in the general case @xmath86 are listed in tab .",
    "i , where we put @xmath117 @xmath118    although the number and position of the critical points is affected only quantitatively by the extra coupling , their stability properties are modified in a more radical way . in particular , while for @xmath83 only the points @xmath119 and @xmath108 can be attractors , here we show that also @xmath109 and @xmath111 may be stable .",
    "only the point @xmath113 remains always unstable .",
    "the stability analysis is performed as usual by linearization around the critical points .",
    "the parametric regions in which the real part of both eigenvalues of the linearization matrix is negative are regions of stability . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we only consider the crucial property of stability versus instability , paying no attention to the topography of the critical point ( whether it is a knot , spiral , or saddle ) . in the following ,",

    "3 we present four phase spaces displaying in turn the four possible attractors .",
    "the parameters correspond to the points marked with stars in fig .",
    "as already remarked , attractors @xmath109 and @xmath111 have not been previously noticed . also , it is important to remark that the attractors are not only locally stable , but extend their basin of attraction to all of the phase space .",
    "that is , _ any _ possible initial condition lead to the attractor .",
    "here we leave the dynamical analysis of the system in the rescaled frame and get back to the original one . what the attractors look like in the jordan frame ?    reintroducing the tildes , we have along the attractors @xmath119 and @xmath108 ( from now on , quantities without tildes are expressed in the original metric ) @xmath151 ( for @xmath152 ) where @xmath153 on the attractors @xmath109 and @xmath111 , for which @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and the conformal transformation can not be performed . since @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath156 , the attractors @xmath109 and @xmath111 lead to an effective gravitational constant that is either zero or infinite and are therefore to be rejected as possible solutions in the jordan frame .",
    "of course , trajectories that have not already reached the attractor can not be excluded , but these are not scaling solutions , and will not be further considered in this paper .",
    "( [ tab ] ) it follows ( neglecting the subscripts ) @xmath157 from the latter expression we can evaluate the relation between the old and new time and scale factor , given by eq .",
    "( [ timerescal ] ) and ( [ arescal ] ) .",
    "we obtain ( for @xmath158 ) @xmath159 as can be seen , for @xmath160 the old and new metric coincide ; in this limit the scalar field vanishes on the attractor , and the system reduces to the pure perfect fluid friedmann case .",
    "it follows that in the original variables the scale factor is again a power law @xmath161 on the attractor @xmath119 , @xmath162 which is inflationary ( both in the original and in the rescaled frame ) if @xmath163 , that is @xmath164 , we have @xmath165 consider now some special cases .",
    "if @xmath166 the scale factor follows a _ pole - like _ inflation , @xmath167 with negative exponent . for @xmath168 , ( i.e",
    "@xmath169 ) the old and new metric coincide ( up to a constant ) , the field freezes to a constant and its energy drives a desitter expansion .",
    "the system reduces asymptotically to pure general relativity with a cosmological constant .",
    "finally , for @xmath170 ( i.e. @xmath171 ) , the scale factor is power law accelerated in the new frame , but maps again to a desitter expansion in the original frame .",
    "if @xmath7 is quadratic in @xmath172 , then the inflationary condition on the solution @xmath119 reads @xmath173 on the attractor @xmath108 , on the other hand , putting @xmath174 with @xmath175 we obtain @xmath176 notice that @xmath177 for @xmath160 , as expected . since the property of being accelerated is conformally invariant ( for positive definite conformal factors ) , going back to the old frame do not change qualitatively the attractors found so far . also , it is not difficult to check that @xmath178 and @xmath85 are invariant under conformal transformation , so that @xmath179 .",
    "it can be shown that the choice @xmath180 is the only one that allows scaling attractors in both the old and the new metric .",
    "other choices are possible that allow scaling solutions either in the old or in the new metric : for instance , @xmath181 gives scaling attractors in the new metric but not in the old one .",
    "once we have the analytical expression of the attractors , we must consider whether they are viable as cosmological solutions .",
    "the attractor solution @xmath119 is inflationary ( accelerated ) and the scalar field is asymptotically the dominating component . as such",
    ", it may match the observations of an accelerated expansion ; for instance , the value @xmath182 suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite implies @xmath183 on the other hand , since @xmath184 , in order to allow for a substantial fraction in the ordinary matter component at the present , the attractor has not to be already reached .",
    "the solution @xmath108 has some drawbacks .",
    "first , is not accelerated at all for @xmath185 ; second , the constraints from nucleosynthesis do not allow a large fraction of energy density in the scalar field , so that it can not provide closure energy . however , as argued in @xcite , models which reach this attractor compare favorably with observations of large scale structure , and may have a simple interpretation in terms of fundamental physics .",
    "both solutions @xmath119 and @xmath108 are heavily constrained by the upper limits on the variability of the gravitational constant .",
    "we have @xmath186 comparing with the observational constraint @xmath187 , and assuming @xmath188 gyr , we obtain the condition @xmath189 current constraints ( see e.g. @xcite ) give @xmath190 or smaller .",
    "this implies @xmath191 , too large for the attractor @xmath119 to exist .",
    "a similar problem arises if @xmath7 is quadratic . along the attractor @xmath108 ,",
    "the energy density in the scalar field is a constant fraction of the total energy . in mde",
    "( and for @xmath192 ) this is @xmath193 the constraint ( [ cn ] ) gives @xmath194 which confines the scalar field contribution to that of a minor component .",
    "this constraint is three or four times stronger than that imposed by the nucleosynthesis @xcite on a minimally coupled field .",
    "in this paper we have investigated a large class of nmc models in the limit of strong coupling with a perfect fluid matter component , searching for attractors that might provide a decaying cosmological constant .",
    "these models include all the cases in which the potential @xmath4 is a power of the coupling function @xmath3 , regardless of their functional form .",
    "we have shown that    1 .   the nmc system can be reduced to a scalar field with an exponential potential , a minimal coupling to gravity , and an extra coupling to the matter .",
