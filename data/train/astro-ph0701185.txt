    "the onset of massive star formation was elusive to observational research until recently . very young regions of massive star formation contain large amounts of cold gas and dust observable from far - infrared ( fir ) to mm wavelengths .",
    "a possibly luminous embedded object has not yet formed or is obscured by the large optical depth of the surrounding cold dust at near-/mid - infrared wavelengths ( nir / mir ) the advent of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) allowed to identify large numbers of such infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) @xcite . however , the irdcs are not a well defined class , but these clouds are expected to harbor various evolutionary stages . adopting the evolutionary sequence outlined in @xcite , irdcs should be capable to contain genuine high - mass starless cores ( hmscs ) , high - mass cores harboring accreting low-/intermediate - mass protostars , and the youngest high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) . while the first group is important to study the physical conditions of massive cores before the onset of star formation , the latter two stages are essential to understand the early evolution in massive star formation . since the evolutionary timescale to form high - mass stars is short ( of the order @xmath8yr , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the central evolving protostars are deeply embedded within their natal cores , observational discrimination between these different evolutionary stages of irdcs is a challenging task .",
    "recently , @xcite observed with the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) a filamentary irdc containing a compact 3.2 mm continuum peak related to a massive core that remains undetected in the spitzer glimpse survey up to 8@xmath0 m ( fig .  [ fig1 ] , left panel ) . based on the glimpse non - detection",
    "one could speculate that this may be a genuine hmsc , however , there are additional indicators leading in the opposite direction .",
    "the spitzer 4.5@xmath0 m band shows weak emission right at the edge of the 3.2 mm continuum core .",
    "this so - called green - fuzzy emission is usually attributed to shock - excited h@xmath9 emission which is especially prominent in this band @xcite .",
    "such h@xmath9 features can be attributed to early outflow activity .",
    "this scenario is supported by single - dish co and cs spectra showing non - gaussian line - wing emission indicative of molecular outflows . furthermore , nh@xmath10(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 )",
    "inversion line observations revealed relatively high gas temperatures of the order 33k which would not be expected in the case of a starless core .",
    "therefore , @xcite argue that we are witnessing the onset of massive star formation .",
    "based on the outflow signatures and the high nh@xmath10 temperatures , a central protostar should have formed already , but it must still be in a very early evolutionary stage to remain undetected up to 8@xmath0 m .",
    "the detection of at least three 4.5@xmath0 m outflow features indicates that even a multiple system may be embedded in this core . at a temperature of 33k and a distance of @xmath33.7kpc",
    "( @xcite12kpc are unlikely to be observable .",
    "the kinematic distance uncertainty is of the order 1kpc @xcite . ] ) , @xcite calculated from the 3.2 mm continuum flux a mass and column density of the gas core of @xmath3184m@xmath4 and @xmath310@xmath11@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .    in the framework of",
    "the above mentioned evolutionary sequence , irdc18223 - 3 should be part of the high - mass cores harboring accreting low-/intermediate - mass protostars .",
    "for such a source , it is expected that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) rises sharply at mid- to far - infrared wavelength and should hence become detectable there .",
    "the newly released spitzer legacy survey mipsgal ( mips inner galactic plane survey ) is the ideal resource to search for such mir / fir emission and study this young source in more detail .",
    "the mips 24 and 70@xmath0 m data were taken from the spitzer archive of the recently released mipsgal survey @xcite .",
    "fluxes were extracted via aperture photometry subtracting the background emission from a close - by region .",
    "the spitzer irac 3.5 to 8@xmath0 m and the pdbi 3.2 mm continuum data were first presented in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we use a 1.2 mm continuum flux measurement observed with the iram 30 m telescope @xcite . for the 3.2 mm data ,",
    "we use the flux within the 50% contour level ( radius of @xmath14au ) to avoid contamination from the large - scale filament .",
    "similarly , for the 1.2 mm data we use the peak flux measurement within the central @xmath15 beam .",
    "@xcite estimated for the whole large - scale filamentary structure that the pdbi observations suffer from about 25% of missing flux",
    ". however , since here we are not interested in the whole filament but only analyze the flux from the central compact peak - emission , this effect is considerably lower .",
    "the accuracy of the flux measurements at mm wavelength is estimated from the data to be correct within @xmath315% and for the 24 and 70@xmath0 m within 20% .",
    "the 3@xmath16 upper limits of the four spitzer irac datasets are 0.05mjy at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m , 0.13mjy at 5.8@xmath0 m and 0.15 at 8@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents overlays of the mips / irac mid-/far - infrared data and the 3.2 mm observations .",
    "the most striking result is that the 3.2 mm core , which is dark at least up to 8@xmath0 m , is now detected in the 24 and 70@xmath0 m bands .",
    "previously , we could only indirectly infer from outflow indicators and warm gas temperatures that the core likely harbors already a very young protostar , but the new 24 and 70@xmath0 m data clearly identify this source now for the first time shortward of 100@xmath0 m .    combining the 3.2 and 1.2 mm data from the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum with the 24 and 70@xmath0 m fluxes on the wien - side of the sed , this dataset allows to derive the physical properties of this high - mass core at the onset of massive star formation in more detail .",
    "table [ fluxes ] presents the fluxes from 24@xmath0 m to 3.2 mm , and figure [ fig2 ] shows the resulting sed .",
    "the spectral energy distribution was fitted with planck black - body functions accounting for the wavelength - dependent emissivity of the dust .",
    "the assumed dust composition follows @xcite . as a first order approach",
    ", we tried to fit the dataset with a single - component black - body function .",
    "while this may work for the measurements upwards of 70@xmath0 m , the 24@xmath0 m point shows significant excess emission to a single - component fit , and a second warmer component has to be added .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents a two - component fit to the data .",
    "while most of the flux , mass and luminosity stems from the cold gas and dust with an approximate temperature of 15k , we find another warm component with a temperature around @xmath551k .",
    "the gas masses associated with the cold and warm components are @xmath3576 and @xmath50.01m@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "since on the wien - side of the sed the emission is not optically thin anymore , we consider the masses and temperatures of the warm component as lower limits .",
    "the mass difference of the cold component between the new fit and the older mass estimates from @xcite are due to the lower dust temperature we now derive ( 15k versus 33k from the nh@xmath10 gas observations ) and the different assumptions about the dust grain size distributions ( following now @xcite , whereas previously we used the approach by @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the integrated luminosity one derives from this two - component fit is @xmath3177l@xmath4 ( 174 and 3l@xmath4 in the cold and warm component , respectively ) .",
    "although , we can not fit the 24@xmath0 m flux measurements without the additional warmer component , it is clear that this component does not contribute significantly to the mass and luminosity of the region . in the regime of low - mass star formation , recently there have been several detections of very - low - luminosity objects ( vellos ) within previously believed starless cores @xcite .",
    "some of these objects show clear outflow signatures ( l1014 , @xcite ; iram04191 + 1522 , @xcite ) , and they are believed to be very young low - mass protostars or brown dwarfs likely associated with accretion disks . in the case of irdc18223 - 3 , the region exhibits outflow signatures as well @xcite , hence it is likely that the warm component in this source is produced by an accreting low - mass protostar - disk system as well .",
    "an important difference between the vellos and irdc18223 - 3 is that the luminosity of the warm component in irdc18223 - 3   although it is nearly negligible compared to the luminosity of the cold component   is about 1 - 2 orders larger than those of the vellos .",
    "since we are dealing with a massive gas core that has on average still very low temperatures and a low total luminosity , irdc18223 - 3 is a good candidate of being a high - mass core with an embedded low- to intermediate mass protostar that is destined to become a massive star at the end of its formation processes .    to constrain the status of the embedded source in more detail ,",
    "we compare our data with the analytic and the radiation - hydrodynamic simulations of the turbulent core model for massive star formation @xcite . at early evolutionary stages prior to any hydrogen or even deuterium burning , the luminosity of the regions is completely dominated by the accretion luminosity caused by the accretion shocks .",
    "the theoretical results obtained by the analytic approach of @xcite and the simulations of @xcite resemble each other well .",
    "some quantitative relatively small differences are due to different assumptions in the initial density distributions , different turbulence damping assumptions and the origin of the core in a shocked filament in the simulations which delay all result in higher accretion rates in the radiative - hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "since the latter likely resemble real cores better , we use the simulations for our comparison .",
    "figure 5 in @xcite presents the accretion rate and luminosity of the forming massive protostar throughout its evolution .",
    "a notable difference between the simulations and our observations is that the simulated luminosity is only that of the primary protostar , whereas the estimated luminosity of irdc18223 - 3 includes likely multiple objects as well as potential contributions from external heating .",
    "however , since there is no detected uchii region or strong o - star within several pc from irdc18223 - 3 , external heating contributions should be negligible .",
    "since massive star formation is usually proceeding in a clustered mode , multiple embedded protostars below our current angular resolution limit ( @xmath17 at 3 mm wavelength corresponding to approximately 15000au , @xcite ) can not be excluded .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the luminosity of the region will be dominated by the most massive protostellar object which is also confirmed by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears reasonable to compare these simulations with our observational results .",
    "the luminosity obtained for irdc18223 - 3 is reached in the simulations by @xcite already at extremely early times when the protostellar mass is still well below half a solar mass .",
    "the corresponding accretion rates are of the order @xmath18m@xmath4yr@xmath7 . therefore , combining the model predictions with the observed properties of this region indicates that we are really dealing with a massive gas core that harbors an embedded , accreting low - mass protostar with accretion rates that are high enough that it will eventually form a massive star .    although the data do not allow us to unambiguously exclude that the embedded low - mass protostar may remain a low - mass object potentially never forming a massive star , the fact that the gas core is very massive , and that the luminosity is already relatively high ( a genuine low - mass protostar has orders of magnitude lower accretion rates and hence a significantly lower accretion luminosity ) , strongly supports the proposed scenario of a massive star - forming region right at the onset of protostellar evolution and accretion .",
    "the example of irdc18223 - 3 shows the power of combining ( sub)mm high - spatial - resolution observations with the recently available near-/mid / and far - infrared surveys of the galactic plane by spitzer .",
    "combining these datasets allows us to constrain the seds of the youngest massive star - forming regions in unprecedented detail .",
    "this way we can observationally characterize the various evolutionary stages right at the beginning of massive star formation , in particular the largely unknown properties of genuine high - mass starless cores and high - mass cores harboring low- to intermediate - mass protostars like the case of irdc18223 - 3 . we are currently performing radiative transfer modeling that incorporates age estimates based on the emerging mir flux but this is out of the scope of the current paper .",
    "for the coming years we can expect studies of larger irdc samples setting constraints on the source properties in a statistical sense ."
