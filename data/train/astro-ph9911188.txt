    "the properties of @xmath0-mode oscillations in rotating newtonian stars were initially investigated by papaloizou & pringle ( 1978 ) , who suggested they may explain the short - period oscillations seen in cataclysmic variables .",
    "recent work demonstrating that gravitational radiation can cause the @xmath0  modes of rotating fluid stars to grow ( see , e.g. , andersson 1998 ; andersson , kokkotas , & stergioulas 1998 ; friedman & morsink 1998 ; lindblom , owen , & morsink 1998 ) has generated renewed interest in these modes ( see bildsten 1998 ; madsen 1998 ; owen et al .  1998",

    "unlike nonaxisymmetric density perturbations , the @xmath0  modes would be unstable at an arbitrarily small angular velocity if neutron stars were made of perfect fluids .",
    "this increases the potential astrophysical significance of the @xmath0  modes .",
    "the studies carried out to date have established the basic features of the @xmath0-mode instability in fluid stars , but important questions remain .",
    "these include interaction of @xmath0  mode oscillations with the stellar magnetic field and the proton flux tubes in the core ; the effects of core - crust coupling ; and the nonlinear development of these oscillations .    here",
    "we investigate the distortion of the stellar magnetic field caused by @xmath0  mode oscillations and the effect of this distortion on the onset and evolution of the @xmath0-mode instability when the effects of the superconductivity of the neutron star core are included .",
    "we show that a magnetic field of @xmath9  g will prevent @xmath0-mode oscillations from occurring , even if the star is spinning very rapidly .",
    "a much weaker field will prevent @xmath0-mode oscillations from being excited by gravitational wave emission or cause them to die out as the star spins down .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the fluid motions produced by the @xmath0 modes and their interaction with the magnetic field of the star will be presented in a longer paper ( rezzolla et al .",
    "the lowest - order newtonian velocity perturbations produced by small - amplitude @xmath0-mode oscillations of a slowly and uniformly rotating , nonmagnetic , inviscid , fluid star can be determined by expanding the fluid equations in powers of the dimensionless mode amplitude @xmath11 and the ratio @xmath12 , keeping only the lowest - order nonvanishing terms , which are of order @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath2 is the angular velocity of the star and @xmath14 is approximately the angular velocity at which mass - shedding is expected to occur ( see lindblom et al .",
    "the eulerian velocity perturbations that are solutions of these linearized fluid equations for barytropic stars are of axial type and may be written @xmath15 , where @xmath10 is the radius of the star , @xmath16 is the magnetic - type vector spherical harmonic , and @xmath17 is the angular frequency of the mode in the inertial frame ; to this same order , @xmath18 ( see provost , berthomieu , & rocca 1981 ; friedman & morsink 1998 ; lindblom et al.1998 ) .",
    "we are interested in the velocities of fluid elements in the frame corotating with the unperturbed fluid of the star .",
    "these velocities can be determined by using @xmath19 to compute the motion of a given element of fluid . in a spherical coordinate basis @xmath20 ,",
    "the velocity of the fluid element located at @xmath21 is @xmath22 @xmath23 where the dot denotes the total derivative with respect to time , @xmath24 is the radial mode function , @xmath25^{-1 } [ ( 2\\ell+1)!/4\\pi]^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath26 is the angular frequency in the corotating frame .",
    "we expect @xmath0  waves to cause fluid elements to drift as well as gyrate , just as sound and water waves cause fluid elements to    drift as well as oscillate ( see landau & lifshitz 1959 ,   64 ; the time average of @xmath19 at a _ fixed _ location in the corotating frame is of course zero ) .",
    "we expect the drift of fluid elements given by the velocity field @xmath19 to be qualitatively correct and perhaps exact to order @xmath27 .",
    "( computing the drift of fluid elements caused by sound waves and shallow water waves using the solutions @xmath28 of the relevant linearized fluid equations as we have for the @xmath0  waves gives these drifts exactly to second order in the wave amplitude ; see rezzolla et al .  2000 . ) as figure  1 shows , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 excursions of a fluid element during a gyration are comparable .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath31 produced by @xmath19 is in the azimuthal direction ; its sign and magnitude vary with @xmath0 and @xmath30 .",
    "fluid elements in the northern and southern hemispheres equidistant from the rotation equator drift in the same direction at the same rate , although their gyrational motions are different .",
    "an analytical expression for the drift velocity of a given fluid element can be obtained by expanding equations  ( [ tdot ] ) and  ( [ pdot ] ) in powers of @xmath11 , averaging over a gyration , and retaining only the lowest - order nonvanishing term . for the @xmath5 mode ,",
    "this gives @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the unit vector in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "hence the net displacement in the azimuthal direction after an oscillation is approximately @xmath35 times the radius of gyration .",
    "the total displacement in @xmath29 from the onset of the oscillation at @xmath36 to time @xmath37 is @xmath38 direct numerical integrations of equations  ( [ tdot ] ) and  ( [ pdot ] ) show that expression  ( [ dxphit ] ) accurately describes the secular displacement given by these equations , even for @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath0  modes produce fluid motions perpendicular to any plausible stellar magnetic field .",
    "such motions distort the field , increasing its energy . as we show in   4 ,",
    "the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the @xmath0  modes can be related to the increase in magnetic field energy . at the core temperatures @xmath40",
    "k relevant to @xmath0-mode excitation in newly formed neutron stars , the electrical conductivity of the core is @xmath41 ( see lamb 1991 , ",
    "4.2 ) , so the diffusion time for fields that vary on length scales @xmath42 cm is @xmath43  yr , much longer than the timescales of interest here .",
    "the diffusion time for older neutron stars is much longer .",
    "we therefore neglect diffusion and compute the effect of the fluid motions on the magnetic field in the ideal mhd limit in which field lines are `` frozen into '' the fluid and carried with it .",
    "the evolution of @xmath44 can be computed to leading order in @xmath11 without considering the change in @xmath45 , because @xmath46 .",
    "here we also neglect any instability of the magnetic field .",
    "we defer consideration of the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the oscillations to   4 . with these approximations ,",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field is given by the induction equation @xmath47 , where @xmath48 describes the rate of change of @xmath49 at a fixed position in the frame corotating with the star and @xmath50 is the fluid velocity in this frame .",
    "the distortion of the magnetic field during an @xmath0-mode gyration is given by the induction equation with @xmath51 .",
    "the perturbation of the field during a single oscillation is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , because @xmath54 has magnitude @xmath55 and varies with radius and latitude on the scale @xmath10 .",
    "hence the distortion of the field during an oscillation is @xmath56 .",
    "0.4truecm    the magnetic field of the star is increasingly distorted by @xmath0-mode oscillations , because @xmath31 varies with radius and latitude .",
    "the shear produced by @xmath31 generates an azimuthal magnetic field from any poloidal field @xmath57 that is initially present .",
    "the evolution of the azimuthal field is given by the induction equation with @xmath58 , so the change in the azimuthal field from the time @xmath36 that the oscillation begins to time @xmath37 is given approximately by @xmath59 .",
    "the change in @xmath60 can be computed more accurately by noting that the induction equation can also be written @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the rate of change of @xmath44 in the frame comoving with the fluid .",
    "this equation can be integrated to relate the magnetic field at the position @xmath63 of a given fluid element at time @xmath37 to the magnetic field at the position @xmath64 of the same fluid element at the earlier time @xmath36 ( see parker 1979 ,   4.3 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the coordinate strain between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution of the azimuthal magnetic field can be computed by averaging the azimuthal component of equation  ( [ intgrl_indctn ] ) over a time @xmath67 much longer than a single gyration but much shorter than the time for a fluid element to drift around the star .",
    "symmetry arguments and direct numerical integration of equations  ( [ tdot ] ) and  ( [ pdot ] ) show that the gyration - averaged displacement is independent of @xmath29 and hence that @xmath68 .",
    "thus the gyration - averaged azimuthal field at position @xmath69 at time @xmath37 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 and the brackets indicate that the quantity is gyration - averaged .",
    "hereafter we will consider only gyration - averaged quantities , omitting the brackets for brevity .    as explained in   4 ,",
    "the damping effect of the magnetic field can be related to the rate at which the energy in the magnetic field increases . after a short time , the energy in the magnetic field is dominated by the volume average of @xmath72 , which depends on the structure of the initial magnetic field as well as on the @xmath0  mode in question .",
    "@xmath73 can be computed numerically from equation  ( [ intgrl_indctn ] ) or analytically from equation  ( [ intgrl_indctn_phi ] ) using equation  ( [ dxphit ] ) with @xmath74 replaced by its appropriately weighted latitude average @xmath75 . for the @xmath5 mode and an initial magnetic field that is dipolar and aligned with the rotation axis of the star , @xmath76",
    "; for other modes and field orientations , @xmath75 is different but of the same order .",
    "hereafter , in computing volume averages we assume a dipolar initial field and exclude the volume inside @xmath77 because of the divergence of the dipolar field as @xmath78 .",
    "we illustrate the possible effects of the interaction of @xmath0  modes with the magnetic field of a newly formed neutron star by considering the evolutionary scenario outlined by owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in this scenario",
    "the star is assumed to be completely fluid , the initial spin rate @xmath79 is assumed to be @xmath3 , and the saturation amplitudes of the @xmath0  modes are assumed to be @xmath80 . the velocity field is taken to be @xmath19 , even though this expression is valid only for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "owen et al .  assumed that viscous damping is small enough initially that gravity wave emission can cause velocity perturbations of @xmath0-mode character to grow , but that gravity wave emission has no other effect on the velocity field .",
    "the growth timescale is assumed to be the gravity wave emission timescale @xmath83 , which is several tens of seconds for the fastest - growing , @xmath5 mode .",
    "owen et al .  assumed further that exponential growth ends when the amplitude of this mode reaches its saturation value , that this is the only nonlinear effect , and that the star then spins down at the rate given by angular momentum loss to @xmath5 gravitational radiation . in their scenario ,",
    "viscous damping of the @xmath0  modes becomes important after about a year .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of the stellar magnetic field in this scenario , except that for simplicity we have neglected viscosity .",
    "although we mention here our result for @xmath84 , in order to allow comparison with the results of owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we emphasize that the approximations made in deriving @xmath28 are accurate only for @xmath85 .",
    "a polytropic stellar model with @xmath86 and mass @xmath87 has @xmath88  km and @xmath89  rad  s@xmath90 . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the @xmath5 mode initially grows exponentially on the timescale @xmath92s .",
    "if the amplitude of the initial perturbation is @xmath93 and the saturation amplitude is 0.1 , the mode saturates after about 430  s. the volume - averaged azimuthal magnetic fields @xmath94 at saturation and after 1  year are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , where the hats indicate an orthonormal basis and @xmath97 is the volume - averaged poloidal component of the initial magnetic field .",
    "the evolution of @xmath98 computed analytically using equations  ( [ dxphit ] ) and  ( [ intgrl_indctn_phi ] ) agrees well with the evolution computed numerically using equations  ( [ tdot ] ) , ( [ pdot ] ) , and  ( [ intgrl_indctn ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0-mode oscillations in magnetic stars is likely to be affected not only by gravitational radiation and viscous dissipation , but also by the loss of rotational and mode energy to electromagnetic radiation and the growth of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "here we focus on the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the @xmath99 mode .",
    "although a detailed analysis of the change in the character and evolution of the @xmath0 modes caused by their interaction with the stellar magnetic field is beyond the scope of the present paper , the important qualitative effects can be estimated simply .",
    "if the magnetic field is strong enough , it will prevent @xmath0-mode oscillations from occurring .",
    "a much weaker magnetic field will prevent gravitational radiation from exciting @xmath0-mode oscillations or cause them to die out as the star spins down .",
    "the estimates presented here are confirmed by more detailed calculations ( rezzolla et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "_ prevention of @xmath0-mode oscillations_.the distortion of the magnetic field during an @xmath0-mode oscillation will prevent the oscillation from occurring if the energy @xmath100 that it costs to distort the magnetic field in the manner required by the mode is greater than the energy @xmath101 in the mode .",
    "( the fractional change in the mode energy produced by gravitational wave emission during a single oscillation period is @xmath102 .",
    "it is always @xmath103 and therefore can be neglected in this comparison . )",
    "we denote the critical magnetic field that prevents @xmath0-mode oscillations @xmath104 .",
    "consider first @xmath100 for a normal stellar core ( we discuss the more realistic but less familiar case of a superconducting core below ) .",
    "an estimate of the change in the magnetic energy of the star during an oscillation is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the magnetic field perturbation . as shown in   3 , @xmath107 and hence @xmath108 .",
    "the mode energy @xmath101 is @xmath109 ( see lindblom et al.1998 ) , where @xmath110 , and hence @xmath111 .",

    "the core of the neutron star is expected to be a type  ii superconductor when the temperature there falls below the critical temperature @xmath116  k ( see lamb 1991 , ",
    "this is expected to occur after a few days ( see tsuruta & nomoto 1988 ) . in the superconducting core , the magnetic field is confined to flux tubes .",
    "the total energy of the flux tubes is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the total magnetic flux , @xmath119 is the field inside a flux tube , and @xmath120 is the average length of a flux tube . during an oscillation the flux tubes are sheared a distance @xmath121 , which increases their length by @xmath122 and their total energy by @xmath123 . if @xmath124  g , then @xmath125 , but as @xmath126  g , the flux tubes crowd one another and @xmath127 . when @xmath128 , the normal cores of the flux tubes touch and the superconducting state is destroyed ( see de gennes 1966 , chs .  3 & 6 ) . if @xmath2 is @xmath129 , the magnetic field needed to prevent oscillation of the @xmath5 mode is @xmath130 and hence @xmath131 , whether or not the core is superconducting . if instead @xmath132 , then @xmath133 g , where @xmath134 .    _",
    "damping of @xmath0-mode oscillations_.the increase in the energy of the magnetic field produced by the @xmath0-mode drift reduces the mode energy . if the rate @xmath135 at which the magnetic field extracts energy from a mode is greater than the rate @xmath136 at which gravity wave emission pumps energy into it , the mode either will not be excited or , if it was excited earlier , will decay . for a given stellar magnetic field ,",
    "the condition @xmath137 defines a critical spin rate @xmath138 above which @xmath0  modes are excited and below which they are damped .",
    "if the core were normal , @xmath139 would be @xmath140 , once @xmath141 exceeds @xmath142 . as shown in   3 , @xmath143 ,",
    "so @xmath144 and the critical spin rate would be @xmath145 , independent of the mode amplitude .",
    "in reality , the core is expected to be superconducting and @xmath146 , once @xmath141 exceeds @xmath142 .",
    "hence the actual critical spin rate is likely to be @xmath147 , again independent of the mode amplitude .",
    "the results reported here indicate that interaction of @xmath0-mode oscillations with the stellar magnetic field is likely to be important and may impose significant constraints on the occurrence and persistence of these oscillations in magnetic neutron stars .",
    "our analysis shows that if the poloidal magnetic field of the star is @xmath148 g , the increase in magnetic energy required to keep the @xmath5 mode alive will exceed the energy that gravity wave emission can supply , unless the stellar angular velocity @xmath2 exceeds @xmath149 . for the model of a newly formed neutron star discussed in   3 , @xmath2 falls below @xmath150 in @xmath7 if the saturation amplitude is @xmath8 .",
    "once damping of an existing @xmath0  mode begins , the mode decays quickly because gravity - wave emission decreases rapidly as the spin rate continues to decline .",
    "the energy density in a magnetic field of the strength needed to damp the @xmath0 modes is @xmath151 of the energy density in the mode ( the smallness of this number reflects the weakness of pumping by gravity wave emission ) .",
    "in contrast , the ratio of the fluid displacement after one gyration to the radius of gyration is @xmath152 , which is many orders of magnitude larger for mode amplitudes of interest .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that the magnetic field will distort the @xmath0  mode velocity field enough to cancel the fluid drift before it suppresses the oscillation .",
    "if @xmath0 modes grow to appreciable amplitudes before the crust solidifies , their interaction with the initial poloidal magnetic field may generate strong azimuthal fields in young neutron stars .",
    "spruit  ( 1998 ) assumed that angular momentum loss to @xmath0-mode gravitational radiation would eventually cause the interiors of old , accreting neutron stars with millisecond spin periods to rotate half as fast as their outer layers . neglecting the solid crust and its coupling to the interior",
    ", he estimated that this differential rotation would generate an azimuthal magnetic field @xmath153  g before growth of the field ends .",
    "the results reported here indicate that if @xmath0  mode oscillations occur , then the fluid motions they produce will themselves generate an azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "however , the damping effect of a moderately strong poloidal field will prevent such oscillations from developing .",
    "important issues remain unresolved .",
    "one is whether the back - reaction of the gravitational radiation force affects only the amplitudes of the oscillations or also the structure of the velocity field in the star .",
    "we note that if it is rotating sufficiently rapidly , a uniformly rotating , incompressible ( maclaurin ) spheroid subject to a nonaxisymmetric perturbation is driven by ( mass quadrupole ) gravitational radiation to a nonradiating , triaxial configuration of uniform vorticity ( a `` stationary football with internal mass currents '' ; see miller 1974 ; detweiler & lindblom 1977 ; lai & shapiro 1995 ) .",
    "another important question is the nonlinear development and saturation of the @xmath0  modes .",
    "do the low-@xmath154 modes grow to amplitudes of order 1 , or do they stop growing earlier because of the loss of mode energy to higher-@xmath154 modes ?",
    "we note that pumping of @xmath0  modes by gravitational radiation is a relatively weak effect , so that even a small energy loss rate due to mode - mode coupling can balance it .",
    "as the magnetic field grows , instabilities may allow magnetic flux to leave the star , disrupting the @xmath0 modes and limiting the strength of the azimuthal field .",
    "this is most likely in hot , young neutron stars in which relaxation to @xmath155 equilibrium is relatively fast and the effects of stable stratification correspondingly reduced .",
    "other important issues include the effects on the @xmath0 modes of the solid crust , which is expected to begin forming when the surface temperature falls below @xmath156  k ( see lamb  1991 , ",
    "3 ) , and the interaction of the neutron vortices in the core with the proton flux tubes and the crust ( see sauls 1989 ; lamb 1991 ; ruderman 1997 ) . nonlinear mhd calculations and further investigations of neutron star physics will be needed to resolve these issues fully .",
