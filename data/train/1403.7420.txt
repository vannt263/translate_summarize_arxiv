    "the set of local minimizers of the interaction energy , in both the discrete setting of empirical measures ( equal mass dirac deltas ) and the continuum setting of general probability measures , can exhibit rich complicated structure as studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite that the dimensionality of the support of local minimizers of   depends on the strength of the repulsion at zero of the potential @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , as the repulsion at zero gets stronger ( i.e. , @xmath10 gets smaller ) , the support of local minimizers gets larger in hausdorff dimension .    from the viewpoint of applications , these models with nonlocal interactions are ubiquitous in the literature .",
    "convex attractive potentials appear in granular media  @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated potentials like   are included to take into account short range repulsion and long range attraction in kinematic models of collective behaviour of animals , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the minimization of the interaction energy in the discrete settings is of paramount importance for the structure of virus capsides @xcite , for self - assembly materials in chemical engineering design @xcite , and for flock patterns in animal swarms @xcite .    despite the efforts in understanding the qualitative behaviour of stationary solutions to the aggregation equation @xmath14 and the structure of local minimizers of the interaction energy @xmath12 $ ] , there are no general results addressing the global minimization of @xmath12 $ ] in the natural framework of probability measures .",

    "the interest of understanding the global discrete minimizers of the interaction energy is not purely mathematical .",
    "the discrete global minimizers will give the spatial profile of typical flocking patterns obtained in simplified models for social interaction between individuals as in @xcite based on the famous 3-zones models , see for instance @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the recent nonlinear stability results in @xcite , we know now that the stability properties of the discrete global minimizer as stationary solution of the first order ode model @xmath15 lead to stability properties of the flock profiles for the second order model in swarming introduced in @xcite or with additional alignment mechanisms as the cucker - smale interaction @xcite , see also @xcite and the discussion therein .",
    "our objective is to show the existence of global minimizers of the interaction energy defined on probability measures under some conditions on the exponents .",
    "our approach starts with the discrete setting by showing qualitative properties about the global minimizers in the set of equal mass dirac deltas .",
    "these discrete approximations are used extensively in the literature to show various properties of the minimizers  @xcite , but the existence as well as the convergence of these discrete minimizers is not justified in general . in a certain range of exponents , we will prove that the diameter of the support of discrete minimizers does not depend on the number of dirac deltas .",
    "this result together with standard compactness arguments will result in our desired global minimizers among probability measures .",
    "in fact , our strategy to show the confinement of discrete minimizers is in the same spirit as the proof of confinement of solutions of the aggregation equation in  @xcite . in our case",
    ", the ideas of the proof in section 2 will be based on convexity - type arguments in the range of exponents @xmath16 to show the uniform bound in the diameter of global minimizers in the discrete setting .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to more refined results in one dimension .",
    "we show that for very repulsive potentials , the bounds on the diameter is not uniform in the number of dirac deltas , complemented by numerical simulations ; in the range of exponents @xmath17 , the minimizers turn out to be unique ( up to translation ) , analogous to the simplified displacement convexity in 1d ; in the special case @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we can find the minimizers and show the convergence to the continuous minimizer explicitly .",
    "we will first consider the discrete setting where @xmath0 is a convex combinations of dirac deltas , i.e. , @xmath20 setting @xmath21 for such a @xmath0 one has @xmath22 = \\frac{1}{2n^2 } e_n(x_1,\\cdots , x_n)\\ , .",
    "$ ] in the definition of the energy , we can include the self - interaction for non singular cases , @xmath23 , since both definitions coincide .",
    "fixing @xmath7 for singular kernels makes @xmath3 upper semi - continuous , and the self - interaction must be excluded to have finite energy configurations .",
    "let us remark that due to translational invariance of the interaction energy , minimizers of the interaction energy @xmath12 $ ] can only be expected up to translations .",
    "moreover , when the potential is radially symmetric , as in our case , then any isometry in @xmath1 will also leave invariant the interaction energy .",
    "these invariances are also inherited by the discrete counterpart @xmath24 .",

    "we included the proofs of the convexity and uniqueness because they are quite straightforward in this case , without appealing to more involved concepts in optimal transportation .",
