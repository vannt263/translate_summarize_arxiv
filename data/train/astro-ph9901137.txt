    "galaxies in distant ( @xmath1 ) clusters differ from those in the nearby systems ( e.g. butcher & oemler 1984 ; dressler & gunn 1992 ) .",
    "there is a blueing of galaxy color with redshift , also known as butcher - oemler effect ( hereafter bo effect , butcher & oemler 1977 , 1984 ) . at @xmath1",
    "there is a population of almost normal late  type galaxies that by the present epoch has disappeared , faded or has been disrupted ( dressler et al .",
    "distant clusters contain galaxies with disturbed morphologies and peculiar spectra .",
    "the occurrence of these peculiarities varies from cluster to cluster and , on average , increases with redshift . in general",
    ", the change of galaxy properties is explained as the effect of some kind of evolution .",
    "oemler , dressler & butcher ( 1997 ) proposed a physical reason to explain why most of the clusters showing a bo effect are at high redshift and almost none at the present epoch : clusters at @xmath1 are much more exceptional objects than present  day clusters and they are observed in the act of growing by merger of smaller clumps , in agreement with a hierarchical growth of structures as described , for example , by kauffmann ( 1995 ) . furthermore , this scenario permits the existence of dynamically young local clusters , such as the spiral rich abell 1367 and 2151 clusters , and evolved clusters at high redshift , such as cl 0024 + 16 . in the oemler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpretation of the bo effect , clusters at higher redshift are dynamically younger , on average , than the nearby ones , because we are looking at the epoch of an enhanced cluster formation .",
    "allington - smith et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed that galaxies in groups do not evolve ( except passively ) and suggest that the bo effect should be interpreted as an evidence of the important role played by the cluster environment : evolution is strong in clusters and negligible in groups .",
    "however this idea have been questioned : rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) show that it is difficult to fade the majority of the cluster population at @xmath2 to make their blue population as scarce as in present  day clusters .",
    "andreon , davoust & heim ( 1997 ) and ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that cluster ellipticals and lenticulars are old galaxies already at @xmath1 , and that the majority of them can not be the end product of the blue galaxy population .",
    "recently , this result has been extended with clusters up to @xmath3 ( stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "andreon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have made a detailed comparison of the properties of galaxies in the nearby coma cluster and the distant cluster , cl 0939 + 47 .",
    "they found that the spiral population of these two clusters appears too different in spatial , color and surface brightness distributions to be the same galaxy population observed at two different epochs .",
    "the coma cluster is therefore unlikely to be representative of the end of the evolution path of cl 0939 + 47 .    in order to quantify the effect of evolution on the properties of a given class of objects",
    ", it is required that the observed class is the same at different times . in the case of the evolution of galaxies in clusters , it is necessary that the high redshift clusters studied are the ancestors of the investigated present  day clusters .",
    "the goal of this paper is to test whether the distant and nearby clusters of the bo sample are really the same population seen at different epochs or two different populations ; in other words , we want to check if we are comparing unripe apples to ripe oranges in understanding how fruit ripens!. we achieve this goal by means of the x  ray properties of the clusters of galaxies , whose evolution is known .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we present our sample of clusters . in section  3",
    ", we discuss the x  ray analysis of their images .",
    "the observed trends and their relevance on the bo effect are presented in section  4 and 5 , respectively . in section  6 ,",
    "we summarize our main results .    in the following analysis",
    ", we adopt @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and @xmath6 . the conversion to the physical dimension",
    "is done through the equation ( sandage 1988 ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angular radius in arcsec .",
    "the clusters most frequently compared for measuring the bo effect are listed in butcher & oemler ( 1985 ) .",
    "this list is the master list for many studies ( e.g. dressler & gunn 1992 ; oemler , dressler & butcher 1997 ; half of the sample by smail et al .",
    "1997 ; dressler et al .",
    "1998 is drawn from the bo sample , etc . ) .",
    "our sample is made from the bo sample plus cl 0939 + 47 , a cluster at @xmath1 which is frequently studied in the context of the bo effect .",
    "this sample , which consist of 33(+1 ) clusters , is not complete in any sense ( in cluster richness , in @xmath9 , etc . ) .",
    "figure 1 reproduces figure 3 in butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) , with the addition of cl 0939 + 47 .",
    "the bo effect is evident from the increase of the fraction of blue galaxies with the redshift .",
    "we have x  ray data for 30 of the 34 clusters .",
    "position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) images are available for 25 of these .",
    "we call this subsample  hq \" ( high quality ) sample",
    ". five more clusters , as well as many of the clusters observed by _ rosat _ , have been observed with previous x  ray missions .",
    "we use these old data when necessary .",
    "table 1 presents the whole sample in order of increasing redshift . a double tick and a single tick in the last column",
    "indicate that the cluster belongs to the hq sample and we collect x  ray flux from literature , respectively .",
    "columns 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 list respectively the cluster name , the cluster redshift , the radius @xmath10 that contain 30 % of the whole cluster population , the number of galaxies @xmath11 inside such a radius , and the cluster blue fraction @xmath12 ( from butcher & oemler ( 1985 ) ) .",
    "columns 7 and 8 list the galactic hi column ( from stark et al .",
    "1992 ) toward the cluster direction and the cluster richness [ from the abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 , hereafter aco ) catalog ] .",
    "we update the richness classification of the cl 0939 + 47 ( abell 851 ) and abell 370 clusters , and we attribute a richness to cl 0024 + 16 by adopting the more accurate values listed in oemler et al .",
    "cl 0016 + 16 is twice as rich as coma ( koo 1981 ) .",
    "the aco richness , according to its definition , is the background corrected number of galaxies within 3 mpc from the cluster center having luminosity in the range @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath13 is the magnitude of the third brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "pspc images in the hard band 0.52 kev with 15 arcsec pixel size have been extracted from the public archive at the max  planck ",
    "institut fr extraterrestrische physik ( mpe ) or at the goddard space flight center ( according to their availability ) .",
    "table 2 lists x  ray related quantities .",
    "we correct our images for exposure variation and telescope vignetting using the distributed exposure maps .",
    "all pixels contaminated by other objects or occulted by ribs have been flagged and excluded from the following analysis .    in order to measure the x  ray radial profiles ,",
    "brightnesses are computed in elliptical annuli of semi - major axis increasing in geometrical progression of base @xmath15 in order to take the s / n approximatively constant along the radius .",
    "ellipticity , position angle ( pa hereafter ) and center for the cluster emission have been derived paying attention to the observational data available for distant clusters .",
    "for example , we keep fixed the center , even if isophotes center moves , since in distant clusters we seldom have data of good enough quality to measure the displacement of the center of the various isophotes . when data are not good enough to estimate the ellipticity or the position angle , we adopt circular apertures .",
    "the details of the data reduction are as follows :     the equivalent radius of each ellipse is that of a circle of the same area , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the major and minor axis of the ellipse .",
    " the axis lengths of an elliptical annulus of finite width are at half way from the internal and external edges .    ",
    "the brightness in an annulus is computed as the ratio of the intensity measured in unflagged pixels and their total area .     we assume that flagged pixels have the same brightness as unflagged ones in the same annulus .",
    "the flux inside an ellipse is the sum , over the internal annulus , of the product of the brightness computed in each annulus and the total area of the annulus ( calculated including the flagged pixels ) .",
    "before we proceed further in the data analysis we need to verify two assumptions : the computed profiles are independent of the exact choice of the flagged pixels and of the ellipticity and pa chosen for the integration .",
    "we apply two different flag schemes to the same image of abell 2218 : ( i ) we flag only superposed objects and ribs , ( ii ) we flags every small fluctuation , including very faint ones at the level of the noise .",
    "the resulting profiles are indistinguishable .",
    "further confirmation of the independence of the exact choice of the pixels flagged came from the comparison of independent analysis of the same images ( see next section ) .    in order to test the sensitivity of our profile to the chosen axis ratio , we compute the profiles of abell 2218 within elliptical annuli of axis ratio 0.83 and 1 .",
    "the two profiles are , again , indistinguishable . the profiles of some other clusters , taken from the literature , measured through ellipses of different shapes agree within the errors .",
    "our elliptical profiles do not depend upon the adopted axis ratio , due to our selection of the axis length , and the fact that the pa and ellipticity of the x  ray isophotes are not subject to large variations .",
    "furthermore , we adjust the background level of the abell 1656 cluster , the emission of which almost fills the pspc field of view , in such a way that our profile at large radii matches those derived in literature from the _ rosat _ all sky survey images ( briel , henry & boeringer 1992 ) .",
    "abell 400 exhibits a central point source , a dumbbell galaxy also known as radio source 3c75 , with a slight offset with respect to the center of the cluster emission ( cf .",
    "beers et al .",
    "pixels affected by this source have been flagged .",
    "some other clusters in our list have some peculiar features in their x  ray profile : abell 1689 , 2199 and 2634 present a strong cooling flow ( allen & fabian 1998 , white et al .",
    "1997 and schindler & prieto 1996 , respectively ) . in the following figures ,",
    "we represent with squares symbols these cooling flows clusters .      a comparison between our profiles and those from literature is quite difficult . for most of the clusters ,",
    "the data points of the surface brightness profile are not available .",
    "generally , the best  fit parameters for a @xmath18-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) are the only quantities quoted .",
    "we will use these for our comparisons , even if some information is still missing , such as ( i ) the adopted center , ellipticity and position angle ( for elliptical profiles ) , ( ii ) the value of the central brightness , ( iii ) the radius up to which the data are fitted , ( iv ) how well the model describes the profile , in terms of the location of the deviations from the best fit .",
    "finally some literature values are wrong through mistake or typographical errors .",
    "figure 2 shows good agreement between the best fits as obtained from literature , once the necessary ( if any ) corrections were introduced , and our profiles .",
    "here we note that where we see a local mismatch between the data and the best fit , the same deviations are often observed in the published surface brightness profile .",
    "abell 262 : david , jones , & forman ( 1996 ) found that the x  ray isophotes of this cluster twist and ellipticity changes with radius .",
    "they present a detailed analysis of the x  ray profile computed through elliptical apertures whose pa and ellipticity are fitted to the cluster isophotes .",
    "however , they list only counts integrated within ellipses of unspecified pa and ellipticity , both of which are probably changing with radius . in our comparison , to compute the surface brightness profile , we calculate the gradient of the integrated flux in each ellipse and make the approximation that it was computed within ellipses with the same centre and axis ratio of 0.8 .",
    "our profile matches exactly the one from literature at @xmath19 .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory at smaller radii given the approximation involved in the comparison .",
    "abell 401 :",
    "our points match well those of buote & canizares ( 1996 ) @xmath18 model .",
    "another observation performed 6 months later is in good agreement with the plotted profile , confirming also the temporal stability of the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "abell 1656 : our points lie on the best - fit @xmath18 models in buote & canizares ( 1996 ) and briel , henry & boeringer ( 1992 ) .",
    "abell 2199 : this has been observed twice with a temporal gap of 3 years . as for a401 ,",
    "the two profiles are in good agreement between them and with buote & canizares ( 1996 ) @xmath18 model .",
    "abell 2256 : this is a quite studied merging cluster ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 , buote & canizares 1996 ; briel , henry & boeringer 1992 ) . our center is not located on the peak emission but on the barycenter of the x  ray emission . this explains the rising profile at small radii and the slight differences with the fit functions from literature .",
    "abell 2634 : this cluster presents a strong cooling flow , and is not described at all by a @xmath18 model for @xmath20 . at larger radii , where the profile matches the @xmath18 model , our data are consistent with the best - fit @xmath18 model in schindler & prieto ( 1996 ) .    cl0939 + 4713 : our profile agrees well with the schindler & wambganss ( 1996 ) @xmath18 profile .",
    "usually x  ray profiles are characterized through some parameters , resulting from a fit to the data of an appropriate function , generally a @xmath18 model .",
    "the use of this model presents some problems .",
    "firstly , this method is parametric and introduces the width of the bin in the extracted profile as no - physical scale .",
    "secondly , the @xmath18 parameter , often referred to as the ` slope ' , is not properly the slope of the profile at large radii , as one can verify calculating the radial gradient of the @xmath18 model or , more simply , plotting two profiles with the same @xmath18 , but different core radii .",
    "thirdly , the best - fit parameters are generally a function of the amplitude of the errors .    for these reasons",
    ", we prefer to characterize cluster x  ray profiles through a no - parametric way , computing petrosian ( 1976 ) quantities .",
    "a detailed and recent presentation of petrosian quantities can be found in sandage & perelmuter ( 1990 ) .",
    "briefly , the petrosian radius @xmath21 is defined as the radius where the surface brightness _ at _ at that radius is @xmath22 times fainter than the surface brightness _ inside _ that radius .",
    "figure 3 shows the surface brightness ( @xmath23)and the @xmath24 profiles for a king profile , where @xmath25 .",
    "choosing a value for @xmath22 , of say 2 , the corresponding radius @xmath0 is completely determined ( in our example @xmath26 ) .",
    "the petrosian radius , as a ratio between two surface brightnesses , does not depend from quantities that usually affect surface brightnesses , such as galactic absorption , cosmological dimming , k - correction and even luminosity evolution if it is the same at all radii .",
    "it could be shown ( petrosian 1976 ) , that the petrosian radius is a metric radius , i.e. its angular dimension is given by the formula relating the physical dimension of a rigid rod and its angular dimension . for objects with profiles of the same shape ,",
    "the luminosity within a fixed petrosian radius gives a fixed fraction of the total luminosity , as the effective radius for the de vaucouleurs ( 1976 ) law .",
    "we choose @xmath27 , and we refer to it as  @xmath28 \" . for hubble and @xmath18 model ( with @xmath29 ) profiles , @xmath28 correspond to 55 and 38 core radii , respectively .",
    "the count rates have been converted to the flux in the 0.5 - 2 kev band using a conversion factor of @xmath30 erg s@xmath5 @xmath31 / ( count s@xmath5 ) , almost independent from the gas temperature .",
    "the correction for the galactic absorption has been calculated applying the morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) model as a foreground absorber to the thermal emission from the intracluster plasma with metallicity fixed to 0.3 ( raymond , & smith 1977 ; up to date version 1992 in xspec version  10 ) .",
    "since all clusters are at high galactic latitude , this correction is small .",
    "k  corrections have been computed individually assuming thermal cluster spectrum .",
    "temperatures have been taken from white , jones & forman ( 1997 ) .",
    "for the clusters abell 222 , 223 , 777 , 963 , 1758 , 1904 , 2125 , and cl 0024 + 16 , cl 0939 + 47 , that are not listed in white et al .",
    "1997 , we adopt a temperature of 4 kev .",
    "corrections are compatible with the more accurate values plotted by jones et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their figure 7 .",
    "differences amount to 0.01 in @xmath32 at most , i.e. are negligible .",
    "our estimate of the uncertainties include poisson errors and a generous 10% error on the determination of the background level .",
    "in figure 4 , and subsequent plots , we do not plot the errors on the x  ray flux , since they are smaller than the symbol size , except for two clusters ( abell 777 and cl0024 , whose fluxes are lower limits ) .      for the clusters of our sample , the x  ray luminosities measured by previous missions",
    "are listed in various compilations ( salten & henry 1983 ; lea & henry 1988 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; sadat , blanchard , guiderdoni & silk 1998 ) .",
    "their luminosities are not measured at the petrosian radii , nor in the _ rosat _ hard band , but are simply aperture or isophotal fluxes , usually in the band of observation .",
    "we convert them in our system ( flux measured in the petrosian @xmath0 radius in _ rosat _ hard band ) empirically , by means of the median difference between the ( log of the ) luminosities in common clusters .",
    "our fluxes correlate well with literature ones transformed in our system , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the large scatter is due to the heterogeneity of literature data and to the transformation from one band to another , since the formal error on the x - ray flux in our system is smaller than the point size .",
    "the two outliers refer to the cluster abell 400 , whose central emission has been masked out in our flux measure ( see section 3.2.1 ) , but not in the two estimates from literature .",
    "the aim of this section is to show the existence of trends between quantities related to clusters properties ( richness , size , distance , x  ray flux , etc . ) , and to understand the role played by selection effects on these trends .",
    "table  3 quotes the @xmath0 size of the hq sample .",
    "all clusters , spanning a large redshift range , from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , have similar sizes of @xmath35 kpc with a scatter ( in @xmath36 ) of only 0.14 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the outliers ( at small @xmath0 ) appear to be cooling flow clusters .",
    "cl 0024 + 16 and abell 777 have a too noisy profile to compute @xmath0 .",
    "our results confirm those obtained from henry et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . figure 6 shows that clusters have similar size , independently on their x  ray luminosity , at least in the luminosity range sampled ( @xmath37 erg s@xmath5 ) . furthermore clusters rich in blue galaxies ( solid dots in the figure ) are not preferentially larger , smaller , brighter or fainter than those clusters poor in blue galaxies .",
    "figure 7 compares the optical cluster radius , defined as the radius which encloses 30 % of the galaxy population , @xmath10 , with our x  ray @xmath0 size , for the hq sample .",
    "the @xmath0 is in average @xmath38 times larger than @xmath10 , with a large scatter .",
    "clusters rich in blue galaxies ( solid dots ) do not have systematically larger or smaller @xmath39 ratios than clusters poor in blue galaxies ( open dots ) . even if the two most distant clusters have both a @xmath39 ratio larger than the average",
    ", there is no convincing statistical evidence for a trend of an increasing @xmath39 ratio with redshift .",
    "figure 8 shows that in the bo sample there is a deficit of distant clusters with a x  ray luminosity comparable to faint present  day cluster , and an excess of clusters which are as bright as , or brighter than , the brightest nearby clusters .",
    "this holds for the hq sample as well as for the whole sample .",
    "the x  ray luminosity is correlated with @xmath9 at the 99.9 % confidence level , according to the spearman s @xmath41 and kendall s @xmath42 tests .",
    "the x  ray luminosity of the four clusters not present in the hq sample has been converted to our energy band as described in section 3.5 . in the whole sample ,",
    "clusters rich in blue galaxies ( solid dots ) are not preferentially the brightest or the faintest ones .",
    "the correlation between x  ray luminosity and redshift is still present if we use @xmath10 or a 3 mpc aperture for all clusters .",
    "if we remove the irregular clusters identified by butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) from the sample the correlation is still present , but only at 98.5 % confidence level .    in the x  ray waveband , distant clusters are not brighter in the past than today , and , if anything , they were fainter in the past , not brighter ( henry et al . 1992 ; collins 1997 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ; rosati , della ceca , norman et al . 1998 ) . on the other hand , the x  ray luminosity of the clusters in the bo sample , that span the same redshift and luminosity range of the",
    "above - mentioned _ representative _ samples , increases with redshift ( or low luminosity clusters are missing at large @xmath9 in the sample ) .",
    "this means that the bo sample is not representative of a homogeneous class of clusters of galaxies observed at different look ",
    "back times , but it is biased toward an increasing fraction of bright x  ray clusters as the redshift increases .",
    "we postpone the discussion of the relevance of the trend in the bo effect to the next section .",
    "the existence of a strong correlation between x  ray luminosity and redshift , in the bo sample , makes suspicious any other correlation involving these two quantities .      in hierarchical scenarios , clusters at high redshift",
    "are more massive , on average , than nearby clusters , since only richest clusters are already formed . instead , the ancestors of present ",
    "day clusters were less massive than today and they had not yet formed at high redshift .",
    "therefore , it is expected that , at higher redshift , clusters ( which have already formed ) are richer than nearby ones .",
    "figure 9 shows that the distant clusters in our sample are also the ones with higher aco richness . the spearman @xmath41 and kendall s",
    "@xmath42 tests reject ( @xmath43 99.9 % confidence level ) that the richness is not correlated with @xmath9 .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1997 ) , in their study of the morphological segregation in clusters at @xmath1 ( half of these taken from the bo list ) , noted that the distant clusters are denser than nearby ones listed in dressler ( 1980 ) .",
    "the increase of the cluster richness with redshift in our ( bo ) sample is not due to the evolution of clusters , but just to two selection effects : both richness and x  ray luminosity ( see figure 10 ) , and x  ray luminosity and redshift ( see figure 8) are correlated .",
    "the latter correlation is certainly a bias , and this induces a correlation between redshift and richness .",
    "therefore the trend between richness and redshift is not a property of the clusters but a result of the ( poorly known ) selection criteria adopted for assembling the sample .",
    "the ( apparent ) evolution of the cluster richness is easy to understand from an observational point of view . in the optical , clusters",
    "are usually detected as galaxy overdensity over the field . as the redshift increases , the clusters have to be richer and richer to be detected , and distant poor clusters are likely to be missing in all optically selected catalogs",
    ". the aco catalog , on which the butcher  oemler sample is largely based ( note also that cl 0939 + 47 is listed in the aco catalog as abell 851 ) , is complete up to @xmath44 ( scaramella et al . 1991 ) . at larger redshifts",
    "only the richest clusters are present , whereas at small redshift the number of very rich clusters is small because of the small local volume .",
    "the right panel of figure 9 shows that the central richness , @xmath11 , of clusters with pspc data does not increase with redshift , contrary to that expected from its correlation with x  ray luminosity ( figure 10 ) and from the increase of the x  ray luminosity with @xmath9 ( figure 8) . however , it is quite dangerous to do predictions by propagating correlations between quantities , especially in a biased sample such as our , since too many properties are changing at the same time as the redshift varies .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath45 do not show any statistically significant correlation ( the spearman test indicate a correlation at 60 % confidence level ) .",
    "poor clusters , in the aco sense , do not have too many galaxies within @xmath46 , whereas rich clusters can be very rich , as well as very poor , in the center .",
    "this means that clusters have a variety of galaxy density profiles for a given @xmath11 or @xmath45 , since for the same total number of bright galaxies , @xmath45 , they can have quite different central number of galaxies , @xmath11 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "alternatively , large observational errors affect these two quantities .",
    "figure 10 shows that in the whole sample the cluster x  ray luminosity increases with galaxy richness , as measured by either abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 ) or butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) .",
    "clusters which are rich in blue galaxies ( solid dots ) span the entire range explored in richness and luminosity .",
    "the correlation between x  ray luminosity and cluster richness is expected ( e.g. bahcall 1974 ; jones & forman 1978 ) .",
    "however , in our sample , this correlation is probably the result of two selection effects : as the redshift increases , we sample ( i ) brighter ( see figure 8) and ( ii ) richer ( figure 9 , left panel ) clusters .",
    "our statement can be checked using the data from smail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who studied very bright x  ray selected clusters , independently from their optical richness .",
    "their clusters have @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . adding these data to ours",
    ", the correlation between richness and x  ray luminosity largely disappears , thus confirming that the found correlation is the result of the selection criteria instead of a real clusters property ( figure 11 ) .",
    "a correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath12 would explain many cluster properties .",
    "the lack of blue galaxies in the cluster core , the color distribution of spiral galaxies and many of their properties , such as velocity and position relative to the cluster center , higher surface brightness ( andreon 1996 ) and hi deficiency of infalling spirals ( gavazzi 1987 ) can be explained if spirals falling in clusters have a starburst due to the ram pressure in the hot gas ( bothun & dressler 1986 ) that consumes the galaxy s gas reservoir . during the burst ,",
    "these galaxies become bluer and brighter in the mean surface brightness . just after the burst",
    ", they become as red as ellipticals ( charlot & silk 1994 ) , explaining the presence of red spirals in cluster cores . furthermore , both the existence of galaxies that show spectral signatures consistent with the presence of intermediate age stellar populations ( couch & sharples 1987 , lavery & henry 1988 , dressler & gunn 1992 ) , and the photometric evidence for the blue starburst spirals in coma ( donas et al .",
    "1995 , andreon 1996 ) , give support to this scenario .",
    "we do not observe any correlation between x  ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies for the whole sample and for the hq sample . in a sample of 10 clusters at moderate redshift ( @xmath50 ) , which span",
    "just a factor 2 - 3 in x  ray luminosity , a wide spread is found in the fraction of blue galaxies ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is uncorrelated to x  ray luminosity . using _",
    "einstein observatory _ data , lea & henry ( 1988 ) suggest the possible existence of a correlation between these two quantities in a sub - sample of the bo list , provided that deviant points ( low luminosity clusters and the most distant cluster ) are discarded .",
    "the absence of a correlation between the fraction of blue galaxies and the cluster x  ray luminosity implies that this link , if exist , is complex and needs more physical parameters to be explained than only the spiral fraction and the x  ray luminosity .    here",
    "we note that these quantities are not averaged on the same cluster area , nor on regions whose area ratio is fixed : sometimes the optical radius is 3 time larger than the area over which the spiral fraction has been computed , and sometimes it is two times smaller ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "for this reasons , we have recalculated the cluster x  ray luminosities within the radius @xmath10 used for computing the cluster spiral fraction , but still any significant correlation between these two quantities does not appear .",
    "any sample of local and distant clusters that is not statistically complete can be affected by the selection criteria adopted to assemble it .",
    "this happens because clusters have ( i ) morphological differences in the nearby universe ( zwicky 1957 ) and at @xmath1 ( oemler et al .",
    "1998 ) and ( ii ) their galaxy populations are subjected to several segregation effects , both in galaxy morphology ( hubble & humanson 1922 ; dressler 1980 ; sanrom & salvador  sol 1991 ; whitmore , gilmore & jones 1993 ; andreon 1994 , 1996 ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; andreon , davoust & heim 1997 ) , color ( butcher , & oemler 1984 ; mellier , soucail , fort et al . 1988",
    "; donas et al . 1995 ; andreon 1996 ) , and spectral properties ( biviano et al .",
    "1997 and reference therein ) .    in particular , any selection done on the basis of the richness is contaminated by several factors , such as our ignorance on the physical evolution of the cluster richness or the role played by local phenomena as the enhancement in brightness due to starburst activity . in this sense",
    ", selecting clusters according to their x  ray luminosity is safer , because the physics of the x  ray emission is well known , and easier in detecting ( the x  ray emission goes as the square of the density , instead of the density for optical richness ) .",
    "once a sample of clusters is properly defined , the assumption done is that the same class of objects are compared at different look  back times .",
    "_ our results show that the main cluster sample studied up to now in the context of the bo effect is biased : _ the x  ray luminosity of these clusters increases with the redshift , contrary to the recent observational evidence for representative samples ( see sect .",
    "thus , the nearby and distant clusters in the bo sample are not representative of a fair sample .",
    "this implies that any trend highlighted in the bo sample could be the product of the selection criteria adopted instead of real differences with respect to the age of the systems .",
    "differences in x  ray luminosity reflect , at large extent , differences in the intracluster gas temperature and gas density and , consequently , in the cluster mass ( quintana & melnick 1982 , edge & steward 1991 , white et al . 1997 ) .",
    "oemler et al . (",
    "1997 ) supposed that they were studying richer and richer clusters as the redshift increases , and that distant clusters were growing in a way different from present  day clusters , i.e. merging smaller clumps at higher rate , as hierarchical scenarios suggest ( kauffmann 1995 ) .",
    "this conclusion supposes a physical evolution of the clusters in the bo sample , whereas instead the richness of the clusters in the bo list increases just because of selection effects .",
    "another piece of evidence for the presence of a selection bias in the bo sample comes from the fact that the bo effect is only evident in optically selected cluster samples .",
    "in fact , clusters selected in the x  ray band , with almost the same x  ray luminosity and @xmath50 , show blue fraction values with a large range , and with a mean similar to that observed in nearby clusters ( smail et al .",
    "this mean value is also smaller than the blue fraction in the bo clusters at the same redshift .    to summarize",
    ", the bo sample does not contain the same class of objects at different look ",
    "back times , contrary to the requirement to detect any sign of evolution in a sample .",
    "we note that , although this bias affects the bo sample , it could not lower the significance of the bo effect , if x  ray bright clusters have the same blue fraction of much fainter clusters .",
    "this is a hypothesis that , at the present time , we can not test observationally on an unbiased sample . in the bo biased sample ,",
    "the fraction of blue galaxies does not seem to depend on the x  ray cluster properties .",
    "furthermore , the bo effect is evident even after removing the faint clusters with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "however , we do not know if this reduced sample ( or any other subsample drawn from the bo sample ) is representative for the range of redshift studied , and any conclusion drawn from it should be regarded with caution . in conclusion , we do not believe that selection biases are completely removed by eliminating offending clusters .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , kauffmann ( 1995 ) shows that in their model of cluster formation and evolution the fraction of blue galaxies does not depend on the cluster mass , at least for rich clusters . in that case",
    ", there is no risk in comparing clusters of different masses ( x  ray luminosities ) at different redshift for studying the bo effect .",
    "we stress , however , that the evolutionary interpretation of the bo effect still holds only under the hypothesis that these selection biases do not affect the sample , hypothesis which must be shown to be true .",
    "galaxies in groups do not show the bo effect ( allington - smith et al .",
    "1993 ) over the same redshift range .",
    "for this reason , and under the assumption of the evolutionary interpretation of the bo effect in clusters , allington - smith et al .",
    "( 1993 ) claim that evolution is driven by environment , much more than look ",
    "back time .",
    "however , selection criteria of studied groups and clusters are quite different : groups are _ not _ optically selected , because allington ",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1993 ) built their group sample selecting the galaxies around radio  galaxies of a given radio flux , which is likely to be uncorrelated with the optical luminosity of the galaxy hosting the radio  source , or to the group optical properties .",
    "instead , the bo cluster sample is biased toward very rich ( and x  ray luminous ) clusters at high redshift .",
    "we think that the claim of a differential evolution of galaxies in clusters compared to those in groups , should be pending on a proper determination of the amplitude of the bo effect in a sample of clusters representative of their redshift .",
    "we have analysed _ rosat _ pspc images of most of the clusters studied in relation to the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "we have computed surface brightness profiles , as well as x  ray fluxes within metric diameters adapted to the cluster size ( table 3 ) .",
    "our main results are :      \\2 ) the x  ray luminosity of clusters listed in the butcher  oemler sample increases with redshift ( figure 8) . in the same redshift range ,",
    "there is observational evidence , from _ representative _ samples , that the x  ray luminosity of clusters is constant or decreasing i.e. have a trend opposite to those observed in bo sample .",
    "therefore , nearby and distant clusters in the bo sample are not representative of a given class of objects observed at different epochs , and thus the bo sample does not contain the same class of objects at different look ",
    "back times , contrary to the requirement to detect any sign of evolution in a sample .    because selection criteria modify the sample composition in a redshift dependent way , it is quite difficult to disentangle a real redshift dependence ( evolution ) from a fictitious redshift trend induced by selection criteria .",
    "hence , the observed bo effect measured from optical selected samples is _ not necessarily _ a general property of clusters of galaxies , but could be a selection effect .",
    "there is some independent support to this interpretation : it seems that x  ray selected clusters , all of similar x  ray luminosity and therefore likely to belong to the same class , do not show the bo effect ( smail et al .",
    "similarly , galaxies in radio  selected groups show no evolution , beside passive one ( allington - smith et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "x  ray data have been of fundamental importance in revealing the existence of a selection bias that mimic the trend usually interpreted as evidence of evolution .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that our conclusions differ from those reached when x  ray data were not available .",
    "\\3 ) the aco richness of clusters listed in the butcher  oemler sample increases with redshift .",
    "we interpret this correlation as an observational effect : poor clusters are scarcely detected at high redshift , and , unusually , rich cluster are missing in low redshift samples . other cluster quantities ( @xmath11 , @xmath54 , etc . )",
    "shows some correlation among them or with redshift .",
    "we explain these as the effect of selection criteria . adding to our sample a sample of x  ray selected clusters , the correlations generally lose strength , suggesting the correctness of our interpretation .",
    "\\4 ) the usual interpretation of the bo effect , as due to evolution , holds only assuming that selection effects have not practical relevance , an hypothesis which must be tested .",
    "the absence of correlation between the fraction of blue galaxies and the x  ray luminosity of the clusters may suggest such a possibility .",
