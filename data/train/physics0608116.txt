    "the optical response of subwavelength - structured metallic films has enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the past few years due to the quest for an all - optical solution to the inexorable drive for ever - smaller , denser integrated devices operating at ever - higher band width @xcite .",
    "two basic questions motivate research in this field : how to confine micron - sized light waves to subwavelength dimensions @xcite and how to transmit this light without unacceptable loss over at least tens of microns @xcite .",
    "although surface waves and in particular periodic arrays of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) have received a great deal of attention as promising vehicles for subwavelength light confinement and transport , detailed understanding of their generation and early time evolution ( within the first few optical cycles ) in and on real metal films is still not complete @xcite .",
    "recent measurements @xcite of far - field interference fringes arising from surface wave generation in single slit - groove structures on silver films have characterized the amplitude , wavelength and phase of the surface waves . after a rapid amplitude decrease within the first three microns from the generating groove , waves persisting with near - constant amplitude over tens of microns were observed .",
    "such long - range transport is the signature of a `` guided mode '' spp , but the measured wavelength was found to be markedly shorter than the expectation from conventional theory @xcite .",
    "one possible reason advanced for the disparity between experiment and theory was the presence of an oxide or sulfide dielectric layer on the silver surface , and it has been suggested @xcite that an 11  nm layer of silver sulfide would bring experiment and theory into agreement .",
    "we report here the results of two investigations : one experimental , into the physical - chemical surface properties of the silver structures with the intent of detecting the presence of a dielectric layer and the other theoretical , into the calculated optical response of the untarnished silver slit - groove structures using the fdtd technique to numerically solve maxwell s equations .",
    "these studies shown no evidence of oxide or sulfide layers on the silver surface and the numerical solutions to maxwell s equations show good agreement with measurements reported in @xcite .",
    "three typical structured samples were chosen for examination with fabrication dates of about 12 months , 6 months , and 1 week from the date of the tem analysis .",
    "the structures dating from 6 months and 12 months were part of the series of structures actually used in the previous reports @xcite .",
    "the subwavelength structures consist of a 400  nm silver film evaporated onto a fused silica substrate ( corning 7980 uv grade@xmath0 25  mm square , 1  mm thick optically polished on both sides to a roughness of no more than 0.7  nm ) .",
    "the structured substrates are stored in fluoroware@xmath1 sample holders , 25  mm diameter and 1  mm in depth at the center .",
    "electron transparent sections for cross - sectional transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) examination were prepared by sample thinning to electron transparency using standard focused ga@xmath2-ion beam ( fib ) milling procedures @xcite in a fei 200 fib workstation and placed on a holey carbon support .",
    "the tem characterization was performed using a philips cm300 schottky field emission gun ( fegtem ) microscope operating at 300  kv .",
    "the field emission electron source is ideal for applications requiring high coherency , high brightness at high magnification , or small focused probes of selected areas .",
    "the fegtem has a point resolution of 0.2  nm and an information limit of 0.12  nm .",
    "the minimum focused electron beam probe size is 0.3  nm . in dark field images ,",
    "one or more diffracted beams are allowed to pass the objective aperture while the direct straight - through beam is blocked by the aperture .",
    "in contrast to the direct beam , the diffracted beam interacts strongly with the specimen and selection of a particular diffracted beam allows better visual phase differentiation .",
    "typical regions of ag layer that were thinned to electron transparency are shown at relatively low magnification in the bright field micrograph in fig.[colmlrtem ] .",
    "an immediate distinction can be made between the fused silica substrate ( * a * ) and the ag deposit ( * b * ) .",
    "protective capping layers of au and pt , applied at the time of analysis , are marked at ( * c * ) and ( * d * ) respectively .",
    "the latter are used to prevent any ` top down ' ion damage of the cross - section during the ion beam thinning preparation .",
    "the white colored line marked by an arrow in fig.[colmlrtem ] and shown in more detail in fig.[colmhrtema ] is a band that contains very fine particles of au that are formed during the initial stages of the deposition of this metal .",
    "nm from 400  nm nominal thickness ) but the site was chosen to more vividly show the initial line of gold capping nanoparticles . ]    nm from 400  nm nominal thickness ) but the site was chosen to more vividly show the initial line of gold capping nanoparticles . ]",
    "the fine particles do not exhibit the same degree of absorption contrast as the bulk of the au formed above them because the particle diameters are less than the thickness of the cross - sectional slice and thus do not extend through the full thickness of the tem sample , as do the relatively coarse grains constituting the bulk of the au protection layer .",
    "a higher magnification tem micrograph of this region is shown for clarity in fig.[colmhrtemb ] .",
    "it is clearly observed that the au nanoparticles form a separate layer above the ag deposit and any local undulations in the ag layer are observed to be devoid of any oxide or sulfide layer .",
    "fresnel contrast methods were used to examine the upper surface regions of the silver in more detail and a typical area is shown in fig.[colmfresnel ] .",
    "imaging of layers in cross - section , in which the electrons travel parallel to the interfaces between the two materials , always results in fresnel fringes . because the amplitude and phase changes that occur when an electron is scattered elastically are characteristic of the atomic number , there will be changes in the elastic scattering directly related to the form of the projected scattering potential when there is a composition change at an interface viewed in projection @xcite , analogous to a phase grating filtering of the scattered electronic wave function .",
    "interface fresnel effects can thus provide a signature on the form and magnitude of any compositional discontinuity that is present .",
    "the visibility of these fringes depends on the thickness of the specimen and on the defocus value of the microscope .",
    "the contrast of the fringes is higher with increasing defocus , at both positive and negative values from the minimum contrast condition . from fig.[colmfresnel ] , the critical observation is in the _ absence _ of fresnel effects at the surface of the metal as a function of focus conditions other than at the localized regions associated with the gold protective coating .",
    "the lack of fresnel fringes at the upper surface indicates a lack of variation in the scattering potentials and hence of the chemistry or the composition at the interface .",
    "the lack of fresnel signature demonstrates that silver surface is not covered by a detectable layer of sulfide or oxide since their presence would exhibit differences in scattering potential by comparison with the metal itself@xcite .",
    "the lower detection limit for such compositional differences is a few tenths nanometer layer thickness .",
    "the high resolution tem analysis failed to detect the presence of oxide or sulfide coating on any of the structured silver samples .",
    "this result is in fact not surprising and is consistent with a simple estimate of the surface chemical impurity likely to be present .",
    "since the structures are kept in air - tight sample holders , the total , static volume of air to which they are exposed during storage is @xmath3  mm@xmath4 .",
    "the trace fractional concentrations of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in ordinary laboratory air is less than @xmath5@xcite and therefore about @xmath6 impurity molecules are available to react with the 625  mm@xmath7 silver surface .",
    "the average linear distance between impurity molecules , assuming all of them reacted with the surface , is therefore about 250  nm  a surface density below the detection limit of the fegtem instrument .    for comparison ,",
    "tem was also conducted on a similar ag structure left fully exposed to ambient laboratory environment for more than two years .",
    "the resulting micrograph and electron diffraction pattern are shown in fig.[colmtarnish ] .",
    "the tarnished ag layer is observed to be uniform and the corresponding electron diffraction data shows a fully amorphous ( noncrystalline ) character evidenced by the broad diffuse rings .",
    "the detection of a relatively high intensity signal from a nominally nondiffracting material yields valuable information on not only the crystallinity of the material , but also the chemical composition . comparing the electron diffraction data for the tarnished samples to that for the silver structures described earlier",
    ", we find no evidence of a similar noncrystalline material on the surface of the untarnished ag shown in fig.[colmlrtem ] .",
    "the optical response of structured metal surfaces is simulated using a finite - difference - time - domain ( fdtd ) approach@xcite .",
    "the subwavelength slit - groove structures@xcite can be modelled in two dimensions , and we consider here the case of transverse magnetic tm polarization ( with the @xmath8-field transverse to the plane of incidence and parallel to the long axis of the slit - groove structures ) .",
    "the set - up for the simulations is shown in fig.[contour ] .    ]",
    "the maxwell equations are thus , @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the cartesian components of the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the cartesian components of the current density @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the electric permittivity and @xmath17 is the magnetic permeability of free space . in metallic regions of space",
    "@xmath16 is a complex valued , frequency - dependent function . within the standard drude model",
    "@xcite it is given as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electric permittivity of free space , @xmath20 is the dimensionless infinite frequency limit of the dielectric constant , @xmath21 is the bulk plasmon frequency , and @xmath22 is the damping rate . in order to properly describe the material dispersion of the metal structures we numerically fit the real and imaginary parts of the drude dielectric constant in the form of eq.[drude profile ] to the experimental data collected in @xcite .",
    "the drude parameters obtained in the wavelength regime ranging from @xmath23 nm to @xmath24 nm for silver are @xmath25 , @xmath26 rad s@xmath27 , and @xmath28 rad s@xmath27 , which correspond to @xmath29 = -33.9767 $ ] and @xmath30 = 3.3621 $ ] at @xmath31  nm .",
    "these fitted parameters are close to those determined in @xcite by ellipsometry , @xmath32=-33.27 $ ] and @xmath30=1.31 $ ] .",
    "numerical results were not sensitive to this range of parameter variability .",
    "the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant eq.[drude profile ] results in an additional equation to the maxwell equations([maxwell equations ] ) , describing the time evolution of the current density @xmath15 in the metallic region of space@xcite .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the surrounding free space @xmath37 , and @xmath38 and hence @xmath15 vanishes @xcite .    as a reference for the optical response of the drude metal",
    "we also implement perfect electric conductor ( pec ) boundary conditions , where the metal dielectric constant is set to negative infinity , and all electromagnetic field components are therefore strictly zero in metal regions .",
    "the light source is a plane wave , incident perpendicular to the metal surface and depending on time as , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the peak amplitude of the pulse , @xmath41 is the pulse envelope , and @xmath42 is the pulse duration ( @xmath43 .",
    "time propagation of eqs.[maxwell equations],[current ] is performed by a leapfrogging technique @xcite . in order to prevent nonphysical reflection of outgoing waves from the grid boundaries ,",
    "we employ perfectly matched layer ( pml ) absorbing boundaries , within which @xmath12 is split into two additive subcomponents @xcite . to avoid accumulation of spurious electric charges at the ends of the excitation line and generate a pure plane wave with a well - defined incident wavelength , we embed the ends in the pml regions .",
    "we have tested this approach by direct comparison with the total field / scattered field technique@xcite . in all simulations",
    "the spatial grid ranges from @xmath44@xmath45 m to @xmath46@xmath45 m and @xmath47@xmath45 m to @xmath48@xmath45 m .",
    "convergence is achieved with a spatial step size of @xmath49 nm and a temporal step size of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "all simulations have been performed on distributed memory parallel computers at the national energy research scientific computing center and san diego supercomputer center .",
    "the parallel technique used in our simulations is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "calculations of the intensity , @xmath52 , are performed along a box contour as shown in fig .",
    "[ contour ] , including a line parallel to the metal surface and located at the distance @xmath53 .",
    "the collected data is averaged over time and the spatial coordinates for a range of slit - groove distances . finally , the space- and time - averaged intensity is normalized to unit maximum .",
    "our results converge with @xmath54@xmath45 m and are invariant to the pulse duration ( hence converged to the cw limit ) with incident pulse durations @xmath55  fs . a direct comparison of the experimental data with both the pec and the drude models is shown in fig.[results ] .",
    "clearly , the drude model agrees very well with the data , whereas the pec model predicts oscillations of the intensity with a noticeably larger wavelength and smaller amplitude . in order to properly determine the wavelength of oscillations we use a @xmath56 function with an exponentially decreasing amplitude component and constant offset to fit the data shown in fig.[results ] and extend both the fdtd simulation and the fitting function to a slit - groove distance of 16  @xmath45 m , well beyond the range of experimental data .",
    "we then take the fourier transform of the fitted function over this extended range to obtain the associated power spectrum expressed as a wavelength distribution .",

    "figure[ft - spectrum ] shows the normalized power spectrum corresponding to eq.[damping sin ] as a function of the wavelength .",
    "the two power spectrum plots of fig.[ft - spectrum ] provide the effective wavelength , @xmath64 , at which surface waves propagate as well as the distribution of modes around the peak . note that the drude model for silver shows a marked blue shift in peak wavelength and a noticeable broadening of the distribution compared to the perfect metal pec model .",

    "surface analysis by transmission electron microscopy of subwavelength structured silver films used to investigate their optical response@xcite showed no detectable evidence of material on the surface other than silver .",
    "the suggestion that an 11  nm sulfide layer may be present so as to bring the interference pattern calculated by the authors of ref.@xcite into agreement with experiment is therefore not confirmed .",
    "in contrast to the calculations reported by ref.@xcite , numerical solution of maxwell s equations reported here using an fdtd approach does show very good agreement with the fringe amplitude and wavelength over the slit - groove range of the data reported in @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of the fdtd simulations beyond the range of the measurements shows that the initially decreasing amplitude of the fringe settles to an oscillation with near - constant amplitude and fringe contrast .",
    "these features resemble the calculations of @xcite , but the results reported here show much better agreement with experiment without the need to invoke an 11  nm silver sulfide layer .",
