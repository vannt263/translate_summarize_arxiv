    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) first predicted in 1924 @xcite has become an explosive field of research in recent years @xcite . due to the temperature dependence of the chemical potential in a bose - einstein distribution function ,",
    "macroscopic number of bosons start accumulating onto the ground state at the critical temperature .",
    "this phenomenon is typically phrased as the phase density of particles being large enough such that all particles characterized by the de broglie wavelength overlap to form a condensate .",
    "liquid helium , which becomes a superfluid at the transition , has until recently been known as the only substance which shows this behavior .",
    "however , strong interaction between helium atoms has been an obstacle for a complete understanding of the mechanism of condensation .",
    "recent technological progress in atom cooling techniques made it possible to achieve bose - einstein condensation for neutral atoms . weakly interacting nature of these atoms",
    "enables one to understand the condensation within the perturbative framework .",
    "it also provides an ideal testing ground for some fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics in a controlled environment .",
    "studies of similar phenomena , stimulated by rapid progress in this subject , are no longer restricted to condensed - matter physics and atom - optics but start to involve other areas in physics , such as nuclear - particle and astrophysics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of a finite size container on the condensation . for a finite size system ,",
    "the absence of thermodynamic limit alters various critical behaviors defined and expected for a bulk system @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy has a surface term which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , causing a shift in the critical point .",
    "finite size effects in bose - einstein condensation manifest themselves as the rounding - off of the kink in the specific heat at the critical temperature .",
    "off - diagonal long range order stays in a finite range at the critical point .    for a finite size quantum system",
    ", the invariant operator of small fluctuations has a discrete spectrum . the relevant dimensionless parameter @xmath0 which characterizes finite size effects near the transition",
    "is given by @xmath1 for a nonrelativistic system , where @xmath2 is the thermal de broglie wavelength and @xmath3 are the system sizes in the three spatial directions .",
    "@xmath4 for a relativistic system , and @xmath5 for a harmonic oscillator with natural frequencies @xmath6 . , which renders @xmath0 dimensionless .",
    "the results in ordinary units can be obtained by replacing @xmath7 here by @xmath8 and @xmath9 here by @xmath10 . ]",
    "presence of anisotropy adds more variety to the critical behavior .",
    "suppose @xmath11 for some @xmath12 ( for a nonrelativistic case , this implies @xmath13 ) then only the lowest mode in the i - th direction contributes significantly to the dynamics of the system .",
    "the motion in the i - th direction is frozen out and the system has an infrared behavior effectively equivalent to a system with one less dimension in that direction @xcite .",
    "thus we can classify the dynamics with an effective infrared dimension ( eird ) into the following four cases dependent on the degree of anisotropy :    case 1 ;  @xmath14 @xmath15 eird = 0 ,    case 2 ;  @xmath16 @xmath17 eird = 1 ,    case 3 ;  @xmath18 @xmath17 eird = 2 ,    case 4 ;  @xmath19 @xmath15 eird = 3 .",
    "+ in this paper , we mainly study case 4 where modes in all three directions are excitable . as the temperature is lowered , the crossover behavior between higher- and lower - dimensional excitations can be observed .",
    "each mode is labeled by three quantum numbers associated with the excitation energy in each direction . in the presence of strong anisotropy , with these quantum numbers , it is meaningful to split the whole particle spectum into either zero , one , two , or three - dimensional excitations .",
    "the ground state , being the state with the lowest quantum numbers , is viewed as a zero - dimensional excitation .",
    "let us denote the number of modes excited in the corresponding directions as @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we can define an n - dimensional critical temperature @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) as the temperature at which all the n - dimensionally excited modes are saturated : @xmath23 where the thermodynamic limit in each case is taken differently . as we set the total number of particles @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath25 by tuning @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 to zero , @xmath29 by tuning @xmath27 and @xmath28 to zero while @xmath26 fixed , and @xmath30 by tuning @xmath28 to zero while @xmath26 and @xmath27 fixed .",
    "finite size corrections necessarily modify the above definitions , since they involve excitations in lower dimensions . in section 3 , we will discuss this aspect in detail .    by changing the edge lengths of a cavity or oscillator frequencies for a magnetic trap , it is possible to control the critical temperature and realize the lower dimensional condensation . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath31 holds , condensation is expected to occur in three steps : as the temperature is lowered , condensation into two - dimensionally excited modes begins at @xmath25 when three - dimensionally excited states saturate . at the two dimensional critical temperature @xmath29 condensation into one - dimensionally excited modes begins .",
    "the condensation onto the ground state does not occur until one dimensional critical temperature @xmath30 is reached .    in a finite size system ,",
    "the reduced chemical potential @xmath32 does not vanish . from the expression for the ground state contribution",
    ", we can still assume @xmath33 up to order @xmath34 .",
    "this condition is justified as long as @xmath35 is close to the total number of particles , or equivalently , the temperature is lower than the critical temperature .",
    "although work on bec in relativistic systems has a long history , modern treatment using quantum field theory did not begin until 1980 s @xcite . at relativistic temperatures , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mass of the relativistic field , pair creation - annihilation effects become nonnegligible , and the particle number is no longer conserved .",
    "however , the global @xmath38 gauge symmetry of the hamiltonian guarantees the existence of a conserved charge based on noether s theorem . the net charge @xmath39 in relativistic field theory is given by @xmath40           \\label{f01 } % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] particles and anti - particles have chemical potentials opposite in sign due to the fact that they carry opposite charges .",
    "taking this fact into account , the positive - definiteness of the particle number of the particles and antiparticles with energy @xmath41 requires that @xmath42 .",
    "another important point is the relation between spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) and bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "condensation into the ground state results in a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the field .",
    "hence bec can be interpreted as a ssb of the local gauge symmetry .",
    "this argument presumes that the chemical potential reaches its critical value at the critical temperature .",
    "however , for a finite system , this is generally not the case .",
    "bose - einstein condensation of a relativistic noninteracting quantum field in a rectangular cavity is studied in this paper .",
    "similar aspects for a nonrelativistic ideal bose gas in anisotropic magnetic traps is discussed in a companion paper @xcite . in section 2 ,",
    "we derive the effective action which includes one - loop quantum corrections to the classical action and use the @xmath43-function regularization to evaluate the grand canonical thermodynamic potential @xcite .",
    "the generalized @xmath43-function is written in terms of @xmath44-functions via a mellin transformation .",
    "we then use the asymptotic expansion of @xmath44-functions for a large system size and a small massive field to see the finite size correction to the total charge and the critical temperature .",
    "this asymptotic expansion is a special case of the more general class of short time expansion of the heat kernel which is used for spectral analysis on an arbitrary differentiable manifold @xcite .",
    "the terms in the expansions correspond to the volume ( weyl ) , area , and edge contributions , etc @xcite . in section 3 , we consider the effects of accidental degeneracy in a discrete spectrum and show that the highly oscillating behavior of the density of states is large enough to dominate over the higher order terms in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "we introduce an infrared cutoff to include the lowest mode contribution properly and estimate the lower - dimensional critical temperature accurately . in the last part of this paper",
    ", we discuss the multistep behavior of condensation process in the presence of strong anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the conditions for one , two , and three - dimensional condensations are clarified .",
    "the relevant critical temperatures are obtained .    as discussed and observed in @xcite for a weakly interacting gas , the corrections to bulk ideal - gas ground state occupation number and critical temperature are well - explained by the finite size effects .",
    "interaction effects on those quantities are negligibly small .",
    "hence we expect the results discussed in this paper will still hold for weakly interacting gases . on the other hand ,",
    "interaction effects are known to affect higher moments such as the specific heat significantly and considered to be essential in explaining the observed specific heat data .",
    "extension of our analysis to the strongly interacting case is a nontrivial problem which deserves further careful study .",
    "bose - einstein condensation of a relativistic gas could be relevant to cosmology in the dark matter problem @xcite , or for inflationary universe",
