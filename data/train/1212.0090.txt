    "popular approaches for the computation of these eigenvalues include lanczos / arnoldi - type iterations ( as implemented , e.g. , in @xcite ) or the qr - algorithm applied directly to the @xmath15-dimensional finite element matrices . if a certain structure of the discretization can be exploited ( e.g. , a hierarchy of finite element meshes and/or spaces ) some preconditioned outer iteration for the eigenvalue approximation may be performed and linear problems are solved ( approximately ) in every iteration step @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "our aim is to avoid the application of any eigenvalue solver to the fine scale discretization directly .",
    "we introduce a second , coarser discretization scale @xmath18 instead . on the corresponding coarse mesh @xmath19 ,",
    "we compute a generalized finite element space @xmath20 of dimension @xmath21 .",

    "the computation of the coarse space @xmath20 involves the ( approximate ) solution of @xmath24 linear equations on the fine scale ( one per coarse node ) .",
    "we emphasize that these linear problems are completely independent of each other .",

    "the error @xmath26 between corresponding eigenvalues of and , i.e. , the error committed by the upscaling from the fine discretization scale @xmath17 to the coarse discretization scale @xmath27 , is expressed in terms of @xmath27 . without any assumptions on the smoothness of the eigenfunctions of or , we prove that these errors are at least of order @xmath28 .",
    "note that a standard first - order conforming finite element computation on the coarse scale yields accuracy @xmath29 under full @xmath30 regularity , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "since our estimates are both , of high order ( at least @xmath28 ) and independent of the underlying regularity , the accuracy of our approximation may actually suffice to fall below the error @xmath31 of the fine scale discretization which is of order @xmath32 where both the constant @xmath33 and the exponent @xmath34 $ ] depend on the regularity of the data ( convexity of @xmath35 , differentiability and variability of @xmath36 ) in a crucial way .",

    "we are not competing with these efficient algorithms .",
    "however , adaptive mesh refinement has its limitations .",

    ", certain resolution ( small @xmath17 ) is required in order to ensure unique solvability of the discrete non - linear eigenvalue problem .",
    "it is already exposed in @xcite that our upscaling approach leads to a significant speed - up in computational time because the expensive iterative solver for the non - linear eigenproblem needs to be applied solely on a space of very low dimension .",

    "so far , this method was mainly used to post - process approximate eigenpairs of standard finite element approximations on a coarse mesh , i.e. , approximations with respect to the space @xmath63 . however , the framework presented in @xcite is more general and readily applies to the modified coarse space @xmath20 . given some approximate eigenpair @xmath274 with @xmath275 that solves , the post - processed approximate eigenfunction @xmath276 is characterized uniquely by @xmath277 for all @xmath114 .",
