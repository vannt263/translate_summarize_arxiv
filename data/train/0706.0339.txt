    "at the time of writing , there is no example of a smoothable topological 4-manifold whose smooth structures have been classified .",
    "indeed , no smooth 4-manifold is known to support only finitely many smooth structures , and in virtually every case a 4-manifold that admits more than one smooth structure is known to admit infinitely many such structures . a substantial amount of ingenuity by a large number of authors ",
    "see @xcite for a brief survey  has been required to produce these exotic 4-manifolds , though ultimately the list of topological tools used in the constructions is perhaps surprisingly short .",
    "the standard approach to distinguishing smooth structures on 4-manifolds has been to make use of gauge - theoretic invariants , which requires an understanding of how these invariants behave under the cut - and - paste operations used in constructing examples . in the case of the seiberg - witten invariants ,",
    "this understanding was provided by morgan - mrowka - szab @xcite , morgan - szab - taubes @xcite , d. park @xcite , li - liu @xcite , and many others , and the seiberg - witten invariants have become the tool of choice for studying smooth manifolds .",
    "beginning in 2000 , ozsvth and szab @xcite introduced invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds meant to mimic the seiberg - witten invariants but also avoid the technical issues that for many years prevented the expected seiberg - witten - floer theory from taking shape .",
    "their theory has been remarkably successful , and has had a number of important consequences in the study of 3-manifolds and knot theory .",
    "the 4-dimensional side of the story has been developed to a somewhat lesser extent , however , and the existing gauge - theoretic technology means it is still the case that seiberg - witten invariants are often the easiest to use in the study of smooth 4-manifolds .",
    "our aim here is to develop reasonably general cut - and - paste principles for ozsvth - szab invariants , that will be useful in a variety of situations .",
    "a central tool in many constructions of exotic 4-manifolds is the normal connected sum or `` fiber sum , '' in which neighborhoods of diffeomorphic surfaces are excised from closed 4-manifolds and the resulting complements glued together along their boundary . as an application of the formalism we introduce here , and as a motivating test case",
    ", we give formulae that essentially determine the behavior of the ozsvth - szab 4-manifold invariants under fiber sum along surfaces of trivial normal bundle .",
    "to realize this goal we are obliged to introduce a substantial amount of machinery , including the development of heegaard floer homology with coefficients in certain power series ( novikov ) rings .",
    "this can be viewed in analogy with seiberg - witten floer homology perturbed by a 2-dimensional cohomology class , and in many ways exhibits parallel behavior .",
    "it is our hope that this `` perturbed '' heegaard floer theory will be of interest in other applications as well .    for the sake of exposition , we state our results in this introduction in order of increasing technicality . in particular , ozsvth and szab defined their invariants initially for 4-manifolds @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and",
    "since the theory is simplest in that case we begin there .",
    "the ozsvth - szab invariants @xcite are defined using a `` tqft '' construction , meaning that they are built from invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds ( the heegaard floer homology groups ) and cobordisms between such manifolds . to a closed oriented 4-manifold @xmath8 with @xmath9 , with a structure @xmath11 , ozsvth and szab associate",

    "ozsvth and szab conjecture @xcite that @xmath17 is identical with the seiberg - witten invariant .",
    "we remark that there is a sign ambiguity in the definition of @xmath17 , so that the results to follow are true up to an overall sign .",
    "the fiber sum of two smooth 4-manifolds is defined as follows .",

    "to state the results , it is convenient to express the ozsvth - szab invariant in terms of the group ring @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "that is to say , we write @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the formal variable in the group ring corresponding to the first chern class of the structure @xmath11 ( note that @xmath38 for distinct structures @xmath11 and @xmath39 iff @xmath40 is of order 2 in @xmath41 , so the above formulation may lose some information if 2-torsion is present ) .",

    "<S> we give formulae for the ozsvth - szab invariants of 4-manifolds @xmath0 obtained by fiber sum of two manifolds @xmath1 , @xmath2 along surfaces @xmath3 , @xmath4 having trivial normal bundle and genus @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the formulae follow from a general theorem on the ozsvth - szab invariants of the result of gluing two 4-manifolds along a common boundary , which is phrased in terms of relative invariants of the pieces . </S>",
    "<S> these relative invariants take values in a version of heegaard floer homology with coefficients in modules over certain novikov rings ; the fiber sum formula follows from the theorem that this `` perturbed '' version of heegaard floer theory recovers the usual ozsvth - szab invariants , when the 4-manifold in question has @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the construction allows an extension of the definition of ozsvth - szab invariants to 4-manifolds having @xmath7 depending on certain choices , in close analogy with seiberg - witten theory . </S>",
    "<S> the product formulae lead quickly to calculations of the ozsvth - szab invariants of various 4-manifolds ; in all cases the results are in accord with the conjectured equivalence between ozsvth - szab and seiberg - witten invariants . </S>"
