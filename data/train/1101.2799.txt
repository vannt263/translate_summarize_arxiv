    "solid lines represent valence bonds @xmath9singlet pairs of two spins , @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "two spins in rectangles are in the state and similarly four spins in squares are in the state . ]    the ground - state phase diagram of this model was first discussed by schulz @xcite . in his phase diagram for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , there appear the nel phase , the @xmath7 phase , the haldane phase and the large-@xmath4 ( ld ) phase . in 1992",
    "oshikawa @xcite predicted , for @xmath12 integer quantum spin cases , the existence of the intermediate-@xmath4 ( i d ) phase , the valence bond picture of which is depicted in fig.[fig : vbs - pictures](b ) .",
    "after that , however , by use of the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) calculation , schollwck et al .",
    "@xcite and aschauer and schollwck @xcite concluded the absence of the i d phase . by use of the level spectroscopy ( ls ) analysis of numerical results of exact - diagonalization calculations , nomura and",
    "kitazawa @xcite showed in the case of @xmath13 that , with the increase of @xmath4 from zero , the ground state changes as haldane state @xmath14 @xmath7 state @xmath14 ld state .",
    "the first and second transitions occur at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "since these works it has been believed for a long time that the i d phase does not exist in the phase diagram of the present @xmath17 model .",
    "the dmrg is a very powerful method for spin chains , especially when the magnitude of the spin gap is targeted .",
    "however , it is difficult to deal with the phase transition in some cases , because the phase transition point is determined by the extrapolated values of the finite - size being equal to zero .",
    "thus , it is somewhat hard to obtain accurate results if the magnitude of the gap is very small ( i.e. the correlation length is very long ) .",
    "this difficulty of zero - or - finite problem is not special to the dmrg method but is common to almost all numerical methods . on the other hand ,",
    "the ls method is conspicuous on this point because the phase transition point is determined from the crossing point of two related excitations , which is free from the zero - or - finite problem .",
    "the ls method @xcite is firmly based on the effective hamiltonian , renormalization group method and conformal field theory . in this paper we give a physical and intuitive explanation for our ls method how to distinguish the haldane , i d and ld states sketched in fig.[fig : vbs - pictures ] .",
    "let us impose the twisted boundary condition ( tbc ) @xmath34 in this case the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ eq : bond - alt ] ) for @xmath24 cases are , respectively @xmath35\\,[3,4 ] \\,[5,6]\\ , [ 7,8 ] \\\\      & & \\psi_0^{\\rm tbc}(\\delta=-1 )",

    "we see that @xmath40 have different parity eigenvalues @xmath41 .",
    "then the states @xmath42 and @xmath43 have different parities @xmath44 since they are adiabatically connected to @xmath45 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bond - alt ] ) is @xmath44-invariant , which means there is no mixing between the states with different @xmath44 .",
    "thus the lowest @xmath46 state and @xmath47 state crosses with each other at the quantum phase transition point @xmath22 , as demonstrated in fig.[fig : twist-4 ] .",
    "we note that @xmath48 and @xmath49 have same eigenvalues @xmath44 for the pbc case .",

    "although these wave functions are not exact ones in general , the exact wave functions for the haldane and i d states are adiabatically connected to above two wave functions respectively .",

    "namely , under the tbc , if the lowest eigenstate is @xmath47 , the ground state is the i d state . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lowest eigenstate is @xmath46 , the ground state is the haldane state or the ld state .",
    "there may arise a question how to distinguish the haldane state and the ld state .",
    "recently pollmann , berg , turner and oshikawa @xcite stated that the haldane state is essentially indistinguishable from the ld state .",
    "they also constructed a one - parameter matrix product state which interpolates the haldane state and the ld state without any quantum phase transition .",
    "our results @xcite also indicate that the haldane state and the ld state belong to the same phase , as shown later in figs .",

    "from the discussion of the previous section , we should compare the two energy levels @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the lowest energy in the subspace of magnetization @xmath61 and parity @xmath44 under the tbc . to obtain the phase diagram",
    ", we further check whether the ground state is gapless ( @xmath7 ) state or gapped state ( haldane , i d or ld ) .",
    "nomura and kitazawa @xcite showed that the ground state is gapless when @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the lowest energy in the subspace @xmath64 under the pbc .",
    "this condition was obtained through the effective hamiltonian and the renormalization group method , unfortunately for which we have no physical and intuitive explanation .",
    "anyway , we have to compare three energy levels , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath63 .",
    "namely , the ground state is the haldane / ld ( h / ld ) state , the i d state or the @xmath7 state according as @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath63 is the lowest .    [",
    "fig : h - xy - n=12 ]    figure [ fig : h - id - n=12 ] shows @xmath65 as a function of @xmath3 when @xmath66 obtained by the numerical diagonalization of 12 spin systems . from this figure we can determine the phase boundary between the haldane / ld phase and the i d phase .",
    "we note that @xmath63 is higher than @xmath67 in this region . the behavior of @xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "9 , from which the phase boundary between the @xmath7 phase and haldane / ld phases is determined .",
    "the energy @xmath59 is higher in this region .",
    "examples of the size dependence of the critical values of @xmath3 are summarized in table 1 , from which we see that the finite - size effects are not so serious in our ls anayses .",
    "since the transition between the haldane / ld phase and the nel phase is expected to of the ising type , we use the phenomenological renormalization group method for the numerical analysis @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig4a - new ] and 11 .",
    "the remarkable natures of the phase diagram are :  ( 1 ) there exists the i d phase which was predicted by oshikawa in 1992 and has been believed to be absent for a long time ; ( 2 ) the haldane state and the ld state belong to the same phase .",
