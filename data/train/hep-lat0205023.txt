    "spin systems coupled to fluctuating manifolds are analyzed as a simple example for matter fields coupled to euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "the gravitational action is unbounded from below due to conformal fluctuations .",
    "but that does not necessarily render its quantum theory useless or the path integral undefined . indeed , the existence of a well defined phase was the first and probably most important result of the numerical simulations in four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "its existence and stability were explored in some detail using the standard regge calculus with continuous link lengths .",
    "it turned out that the well defined phase is stable against variations of the measure and the lattice size  @xcite .    in the discrete regge model",
    "the problem of an unbounded action is not present as in standard regge calculus . because of the restriction of possible quadratic link lengths to two values  @xcite in the discrete regge model the action can only reach an extreme but finite value .",
    "the expectation values do not diverge if the well defined phase is left .",
    "what happens is that the lattice `` freezes '' at large positive and negative values of the gravitational coupling , as expected for a spin system  @xcite . to get more precise ideas about the behavior of the four - dimensional discrete regge model",

    "we examined the phase transition of the spin system and the associated critical exponents .",

    "[ sect4 ] .",
    "the situation for the discrete regge model is both structurally and computationally much simpler than the standard regge calculus with continuous link lengths .",
    "the restriction of the edge lengths to just two values was carefully examined in 2d where an interpolation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 was performed  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the phase transition with respect to the cosmological constant is universal .",
    "this was tested for pure gravity in 2d and is expected to be the case also in 4d .",
    "compared with standard regge calculus , numerical simulations of the discrete regge model can be done more efficiently by implementing look - up tables and using the heat - bath algorithm . in the actual computations we took the squared link lengths as @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "the euclidean triangle inequalities are satisfied automatically as long as @xmath4 .",
    "because a four - dimensional regge skeleton with equilateral simplices can not be embedded in flat space , @xmath5 takes different values depending on the type of the edge @xmath6 .",
    "in particular @xmath7 for edges , face diagonals , body diagonals , and the hyperbody diagonal of a hypercube .",
    "we investigated the partition function @xmath8 \\exp\\left[-i(q ) - k e(q , s)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the gravitational action ,",
    "@xmath10 the first sum runs over all products of triangle areas @xmath11 times corresponding deficit angles @xmath12 weighted by the gravitational coupling @xmath13 .",
    "the second sum extends over the volumes @xmath14 of the 4-simplices of the lattice and allows one together with the cosmological constant @xmath15 to set an overall scale in the action .",
    "the energy of ising spins @xmath16 , @xmath17 is defined as in two dimensions @xcite , with the barycentric area @xmath18 associated with a link  @xmath19 , @xmath20 we chose the simple uniform measure as in the pure gravity simulations @xcite : @xmath21=\\prod_l dq_l { \\cal f}(q_l).\\ ] ] the function @xmath22 ensures that only euclidean link configurations are taken into account , i.e. , @xmath23 if the euclidean triangle inequalities are fulfilled and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "this is always guaranteed for the discrete regge model by construction .    for every monte carlo",
    "simulation run we recorded the time series of the energy density @xmath25 and the magnetization density @xmath26 , with the lattice size @xmath27 . to obtain results for the various observables @xmath28 at values of the spin coupling @xmath29 in an interval around the simulation point @xmath30",
    ", we applied the reweighting method  @xcite .",
    "since we recorded the time series , this amounts to computing @xmath31 with @xmath32 .    with the help of the time series we can compute the specific heat , @xmath33 the ( finite lattice ) susceptibility , @xmath34 and various derivatives of the magnetization , @xmath35 , @xmath36ln@xmath37 , and @xmath36ln@xmath38 .",
    "all these quantities exhibit in the infinite - volume limit singularities at @xmath39 which are shifted and rounded in finite systems .",
    "we further analyzed the binder parameter , @xmath40 it is well known that the @xmath41 curves for different lattice sizes @xmath42 cross around @xmath43 .",
    "this allows an almost unbiased estimate of the critical spin coupling @xmath39 .",
    "in four dimensions , after initial discussions  @xcite it is generally accepted that the critical properties of the ising model on a static lattice are given by mean - field theory with logarithmic corrections . the finite - size scaling ( fss ) formulas can be written as  @xcite @xmath44 where the critical exponents of mean - field theory are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . to get more precise ideas about these logarithmic corrections , we first simulated the four - dimensional ising model on a regular lattice .",
    "after this comparative study we turned to the four - dimensional discrete regge model @xcite with spin fields .",
    "we studied the four - dimensional ising model on a hypercubic lattice with linear size @xmath49 , 18 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , using the single - cluster update algorithm ( wolff )  @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed with the knowledge of the value of the critical temperature obtained in previous monte carlo simulations and high - temperature series analyses  @xcite : @xmath50    we performed @xmath51 cluster updates between measurements for lattices @xmath52 , with the averaged cluster size @xmath53 .",
    "after an initial equilibration time of about @xmath54 cluster updates we took about @xmath55 measurements for each of the small lattices .",
    "for the larger lattices we measured after each cluster update , therefore , we took about @xmath56 measurements after an initial equilibration of @xmath57 cluster updates . analyzing the time series we found integrated autocorrelation times for the energy and the magnetization in the range of unity for the small lattices @xmath52 and in the range of @xmath58 for the larger lattice sizes .",
    "the statistical errors were obtained by the standard jack - knife method using 50 blocks .    applying the reweighting technique we first determined the maxima of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath36ln@xmath62 , and @xmath36ln@xmath38 .",
    "the locations of the maxima provide us with five sequences of pseudo - transition points @xmath63 for which the scaling variable @xmath64 should be constant . using this fact we then have several possibilities to extract the critical exponent @xmath65 from ( linear ) least - square fits of the fss ansatz with multiplicative logarithmic corrections considering eq .",
    "( [ e:4d_kc ] ) , @xmath66 to the data at the various @xmath63 sequences . for comparison",
    "we also performed fits of a naive power - law fss ansatz @xmath67 the exponents @xmath68 resulting from fits using the data for the @xmath69 largest lattice sizes are collected in tables  i and ii .",
    "@xmath70 denotes the standard goodness - of - fit parameter . for",
    "all exponent estimates the fss ansatz with the logarithmic corrections leads to the weighted average @xmath71 , which is in perfect agreement with the mean - field value @xmath72 , see . with the naive power - law ansatz one also gets an estimate for @xmath68 in the vicinity of the mean - field value , but this is clearly separated from the mean - field result , verifying the significance of the multiplicative logarithmic correction , cf .",
    "table  ii .",
    "assuming therefore @xmath73 we can obtain estimates for @xmath39 from linear least - square fits to the scaling behavior of the various @xmath74 sequences , as shown in . using the fits with @xmath75 ,",
    "the combined estimate from the five sequences leads to @xmath76 , which is in agreement with the results using monte carlo computer simulations @xcite and series expansions @xcite .",
    "knowing the critical coupling we may reconfirm our estimates of @xmath68 by evaluating the above quantities at @xmath39 . as can be seen in tables  i and ii , the statistical errors of the fss fits at @xmath39 are similar to those using the @xmath74 sequences .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath39 has also to be taken into account .",
    "this error is computed by repeating the fits at @xmath77 and indicated in tables  i and ii by the numbers in square brackets . in the computation of the weighted average",
    "we assume the two types of errors to be independent . as a result of this combined analysis",
    "we obtain strong evidence that the exponent @xmath65 agrees with the mean - field value of @xmath73 .    to extract the critical exponent ratio @xmath78 we use the scaling @xmath79 as well as the scaling of @xmath60 at @xmath39 , yielding in the range @xmath80 estimates of @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 $ ] ( @xmath84 ) , respectively .",
    "these estimates for @xmath78 are consistent with the mean - field value of @xmath85 . in this",
    "is demonstrated graphically by comparing the scaling of @xmath86 with a constrained one - parameter fit of the form @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) .    concerning the specific heat we expect in the case of the mean - field exponent @xmath45 a logarithmic divergence of the form @xmath91 indeed",
    ", the data at the different fixed values of @xmath92 can all be fitted nicely with this ansatz . in particular , for the fit of @xmath93 with 17 points ( @xmath90 ) we obtain @xmath94 , @xmath95 , with a total @xmath96 .",
    "we also tried an unbiased three - parameter fit using the ansatz @xmath97 which in the case of the fit of @xmath93 and 16 data points gives @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , with a slightly improved total @xmath101 .",
    "in we compare these two linear least - square fits .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the three - parameter fit is highly unstable and exhibits strong correlations between the three parameters . to illustrate this instability we plot in the exponent @xmath102 as a function of the smallest lattice size @xmath103 ,",
    "being the lower bound of the fit range @xmath104 $ ] . for comparison",
    "we show in the behavior of @xmath78 results of the fit corresponding to eq .",

    "we have performed a study of the ising model coupled to fluctuating manifolds via regge calculus . analyzing the discrete regge model with two permissible edge lengths",
    "it turns out that the ising transition shows the predicted logarithmic corrections to the mean - field theory .",
    "the critical exponents of the phase transition of the ising spins on a static lattice as well as on a discrete regge skeleton @xcite are consistent with the exponents of the mean - field theory , @xmath45 , @xmath106 , @xmath47 , and @xmath107 . in summary",
    ", our consistent analysis with uniform computer codes yields that the phase transition of a spin system coupled to a discrete regge skeleton exhibits the same critical exponents and the same logarithmic corrections @xcite as on a static lattice .",
