    "<S> @xcite , i.e. , there can not be an algorithm , or for that matter a standard turing machine , that always provides the correct answer in finite time . </S>",
    "<S> as such , this class of problems is in the same category as the halting problem that was famously shown to be undecidable in alan turing s work from 1936 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> each path through this tree is associated with a sequence of outcomes @xmath7 . in order to have a meaningful decision problem , where each input can be described by finitely many bits , we restrict the problem to measurements whose kraus operators are matrices of rational numbers :    given a description of a quantum measurement device in terms of @xmath1 kraus operators @xmath8 , the task is to decide whether , in the setting described above , there exists any finite sequence of outcomes @xmath7 that can never be observed , even if the input state has full rank .    </S>",

    "<S> our approach is to take an instance of the mmp , to encode it in kraus operators having rational entries , and to complete them such that they form a trace - preserving completely positive map . </S>",
    "<S> the key point of the argument is that although we extend the dimension of the kraus operators , a zero matrix is still found in the product of kraus operators exactly if and only if the corresponding mmp contains a zero matrix in the semigroup . </S>",

    "<S> we are now in the position to reduce the quantum measurement occurrence problem to the problem of deciding whether the given semigroup contains the zero matrix . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , i.e. , if there exists a sequence @xmath46 for which @xmath47 , @xmath48 , then @xmath49 has the zero matrix as its upper - left @xmath14 block . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the whole upper triangular matrix ( including the diagonal ) is zero as well , which means that the matrix is nilpotent : there is some @xmath50 such that @xmath51 conversely , let us assume that there exists an outcome sequence that is never observed , so there exists a sequence @xmath46 such that @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath53 be the sequence that is obtained from @xmath46 by omitting all @xmath54 for which @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> then , by construction , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the semigroup generated by @xmath57 contains the zero matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the qmop as described so far asks whether certain outcome sequences have probability _ exactly _ equal to zero . from a physical point of view , it is interesting to note that this result is to some extent robust , in the sense that it remains valid if small nonzero probabilities are allowed . to see this , write every kraus operator in the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> then the probability of the sequence @xmath46 from eq .   becomes @xmath61 where @xmath62 fulfils @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",

    "<S> a description of a classical selective measurement device with @xmath1 outcomes , is given by a decomposition @xmath72 into matrices @xmath73 with non - negative entries ( such matrices are sometimes called _ substochastic _ ) , that specify the action of the device on the classical system . </S>",
    "<S> that is , on outcome @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> the probability vector is transformed according to @xmath75 this is arguably the most general classical analog of the qmop . </S>",
    "<S> the probability for obtaining a particular sequence @xmath17 of outcomes @xmath22 on an input probability vector @xmath71 is @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this is zero for an input vector @xmath71 with all @xmath77 if and only if @xmath78 . the cmop is thus obviously equivalent to the mmp with entrywise non - negative matrices . for this case </S>",
    "<S> the mmp is decidable , which was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath79 , and the general case follows by an essentially equivalent argument .    </S>",
    "<S> it shall be noted that our definition of classical devices is even more general than that of the quantum devices considered before ; it represents the most general form of any conceivable classical measurement device . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we allow for mixing in each outcome , which would in the quantum case correspond to a device that applies a whole quantum channel , not just a single kraus operator , per outcome .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to proving decidability of the mmp with elementwise non - negative kraus operators from which decidability of the classical case and for a subclass of quantum measurement devices follows .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : decidabiliy ] the mmp is decidable for any @xmath80 matrix semigroup generated by @xmath1 matrices with non - negative rational entries .    </S>",
    "<S> although the mmp is decidable for matrices with non - negative entries , it is still a hard problem : even in the case of @xmath79 matrices , this problem is np - complete  @xcite .    for any @xmath1 and @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> both the _ quantum measurement occurrence problem ( qmop ) _ with kraus operators @xmath81 with non - negative entries and the _ classical measurement occurrence problem ( cmop ) _ are decidable .    in order to prove theorem  [ thm : decidabiliy ] we introduce some notation first . for an elementwise non - negative matrix @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> we define the matrix @xmath83 elementwise by @xmath84 for two such binary matrices @xmath85 we define their associative binary matrix product by @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 , which in turn holds if and only if @xmath89 as all matrices in the semigroup @xmath90 generated by @xmath91 under the matrix multiplication @xmath92 are binary matrices , hence @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> we finish the proof by arguing that every element @xmath83 of @xmath90 can be written in terms of at most @xmath94 elements from @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> fix some @xmath83 and let @xmath96 be the shortest sequence of indices such that @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> then for all @xmath98 we have @xmath99 , because otherwise we would obtain a shorter representation of @xmath82 by replacing the former product with the latter . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for each @xmath100 the product @xmath101 yields a different elements of @xmath90 and hence @xmath102 .    </S>",

    "<S> for example , if one considers trace - preserving quantum channels , one can give upper bounds to the number of times a channel must be applied , so that it maps any density operator to one with full rank , by virtue of the quantum wielandt theorem @xcite . thus , the problem whether there is some @xmath6 such that the @xmath6-fold application of a nonselective channel yields nonzero probabilities , for all subsequent measurements and for all inputs , is efficiently decidable .    </S>",
    "<S> second , the above statement has immediate implications to undecidability in quantum many - body physics @xcite and quantum computing . interpreting the above matrices @xmath103 as those defining matrix - product states @xcite , several other natural undecidable problems open up .    as an example , consider a family of one - dimensional quantum wires for _ measurement - based quantum computing _ in the sense of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these wires are described by families of matrix - product states of length @xmath6 , being defined by products of matrices @xmath104 ( the same set of matrices is taken for each site ) , associated with measurement outcomes @xmath105 in the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> the left and right boundary conditions are fixed as @xmath106^t$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the task is to determine whether there exists a sequence of measurement outcomes @xmath17 that will never occur @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent result is a consequence of the above reasoning , together with the fact that the problem whether the semigroup generated by integer matrices contains a matrix with a zero element in the left upper corner is undecidable @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given a description of a family of matrix - product states defined by the matrices @xmath8 , the task is to decide whether there exists an @xmath6 and a sequence of outcomes @xmath7 for a wire of length @xmath6 of local measurements in the computational basis that will never be observed . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is undecidable </S>",
    "<S> .    similar reasoning as in the proof of the undecidability of the quantum measurement occurrence problem suggests that other questions concerning the characterization of measurement outcomes are undecidable as well . </S>",
    "<S> these observations indicate that undecidability may be a natural and frequent phenomenon in many - body quantum physics and computation .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly interestingly , a number of problems in quantum information theory seem to be natural candidates for being potentially undecidable . </S>",
    "<S> this applies notably to the problem of deciding whether a quantum state is distillable , giving a new perspective to the notorious question of deciding whether bound entangled states with a negative partial transposition exist .    _ note added . _ </S>",
