    "the sydney morning herald published a cartoon by george molnar after the opening of the parkes telescope in 1961 , in which a character on horseback , looking at the telescope , explains to a mate `` it s the telescope of the future .",
    "it can look back millions of years . ''",
    "( the cartoon is reproduced in robertson 1993 . )    in the weeks before the parkes 50th symposium i happened to read ( in the sydney morning herald ! )",
    "danish philosopher sren kierkegaard s statement  life can only be understood backwards , but it must be lived forwards.    this paper , based on a presentation at the parkes 50th symposium , attempts to combine these viewpoints to look back over the preceding 5 decades to determine how the telescope of the future has contributed to the development of astronomy by selecting a small number of highlights or incidents from each year , and placing them in the context of other national and international events of note from the time .    in most cases , the paper selected for each year is the one which has had the greatest impact , as assessed by the number of subsequent citations amassed .",
    "this work has made extensive use of the sao / nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) , and it is worth repeating their caveat that `` the citation database in the ads is not complete .",
    "please keep this in mind when using the ads citation lists . ''",
    "it should be noted that ads citation counts are less accurate in the first decades of the observatory s existence , and also that searching for `` parkes '' in the abstract of papers will inevitably miss many papers which appeared in journals such as nature and science ... but will pick up many papers not reporting the results of observations with the parkes telescope(s ) . as a result",
    ", this paper does not purport to be a complete listing of the highest impact papers , but does endeavour to illustrate both the nature and breadth of high impact research conducted at the observatory .",
    "october 31st saw the official opening of the parkes 210-foot radio - telescope , and commissioning work undertaken .",

    "telescope commissioning ended in 1962 and early observations yielded a number of fundamental results . in `` polarization of 20-cm wavelength radiation from radio sources ''",
    "gardner & whiteoak ( 1962 ) noted that their observations of linear polarization `` ... considerably strengthens the hypothesis that the synchrotron mechanism is responsible for the radiation from the nonthermal sources . ''",
    "observations of this linear polarization as a function of frequency quickly resulted in the detection of faraday rotation : `` faraday rotation effects associated with the radio source centaurus a '' ( cooper & price 1962 ) and `` polarization in the central component of centaurus a '' ( bracewell et al . 1962 ) .",
    "elsewhere , john glenn orbited the earth , marilyn monroe died , the cuban missile crisis was played out , and rod laver won all four tennis grand slam tournaments in the same calendar year .",
    "a series of occultations of 3c273 by the moon enabled the location of this bright radio source to be located with sufficient accuracy for its optical counterpart to be identified : as a result 3c273 and 3c48 became the first recognised quasars : `` investigation of the radio source 3c 273 by the method of lunar occultations '' ( hazard , mackey & shimmins 1963 ) .",
    "gardner & whiteoak ( 1963 ) continued their polarisation studies ; `` polarization of radio sources and faraday rotation effects in the galaxy '' , inferring a galactic magnetic field from the measurements of faraday rotation as a function of galactic coordinates . in `` a radio source with a very unusual spectrum , ''",

    "kellermann s ( 1966 ) discovery of radio emission from uranus  which is the atca s primary flux density calibrator in the mm bands  meant that with cm and mm calibrators identified it would only take another 25 years for the telescope that would use them to come along !",
    "the astronomical society of australia ( asa ) was founded , with harley wood as its first president .",
    "the business of finding optical counterparts to radio sources was booming : pks 0106 + 01 , identified by bolton , clarke , savage & vron ( 1965 ) became the most distant object then known , with a redshift of @xmath2=2.1 being determined by burbidge ( 1966 ) .",

    "bok ( 1957 ) wrote `` one could readily justify the establishment of observatories with large telescopes in the southern hemisphere because only there can one study the magellanic clouds '' and high impact papers from the years 1966 , 1974 , 1984 , 1988 , 1998 and 1999 have confirmed this .",
    "almost a third of the papers highlighted for each year have involved hi observations , and about a quarter have concerned pulsars .",
    "there is a good mix of galactic and extragalactic , spectral line and continuum , surveys and single objects .",
    "there have been notable contributions by the 18 m kennedy antenna , and vlbi observations , with higher frequency observations ( @xmath164ghz ) constituting about a quarter of the papers .",
    "the number of authors on the highlighted paper for each year is plotted in figure  3 , demonstrating the move to larger research teams over time .",
    "what factors have contributed to the impact of the parkes observatory ?",
    "the continual upgrading of dish surface , front - end receivers , and backend processors is clear , highlighting the importance of the funding brought in by spacecraft tracking contracts , csiro support , and collaborations with the international user community , not to mention the enabling contributions toward the telescope s construction .",
    "a large majority of high - impact papers have at least one csiro - affiliated co - author , confirming the belief that local knowledge and experience help to maximise the effective use of facilities .",
    "( and on the other hand , the fact there are high - impact papers unaffiliated with csiro makes it clear that the observatory is not a `` closed shop '' and that documentation and user support give all observers the chance to do good science . ) the excellence of support staff , both at the parkes and at radiophysics / atnf / cass in marsfield was referred to by a number of speakers over the week of the parkes 50th symposium , and is undoubtedly an important factor in the productivity of the observatory .",
    "the character in the molnar cartoon claimed the telescope could look back millions of years .",
    "we now know it can in fact look back billions of years , and the highlights from its first fifty years ensure it can look forward to many more !",
