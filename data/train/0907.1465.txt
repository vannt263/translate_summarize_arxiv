    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are extreme extragalactic objects showing core - dominated emission ( broadband continuum ranging from radio to x - ray energies ) and strong variability on different timescales . a supermassive black hole ( in the center of the agn ) surrounded by an accretion disk",
    "is believed to power the relativistic plasma outflows ( jets ) which are found in many agn .",
    "around 25 agn have been found to emit vhe @xmath1-rays ( e@xmath2100gev ) .",
    "the size of the vhe @xmath1-ray emission region can generally be constrained by the time scale of the observed flux variability @xcite but its location remains unknown .",
    "the giant radio galaxy m87 is located at a distance of @xmath3 ( 50 million light years ) in the virgo cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the angle between the plasma jet in m87 and the line of sight is estimated to lie between @xmath4 @xcite . with its proximity ,",
    "its bright and well resolved jet , and its very massive black hole with @xmath5 , @xcite , m87 provides an excellent opportunity to study the inner structures of the jet , which are expected to scale with the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "substructures of the jet are resolved in the x - ray , optical and radio wavebands @xcite and high - frequency radio very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations with sub - milliarcsecond ( mas ) resolution are starting to probe the collimation region of the jet @xcite .",
    "this makes m87 a unique laboratory in which to study relativistic jet physics in connection with the mechanisms of vhe @xmath1-ray emission in agn .",
    "vlbi observations of the m87 inner jet show a well resolved , edge - brightened structure extending to within @xmath6 ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 schwarzschild radii @xmath9 ) of the core .",
    "closer to the core , the jet has a wide opening angle suggesting that this is the collimation region @xcite . along the jet ,",
    "monitoring observations show both near - stationary components @xcite ( pc - scale ) and features that move at apparent superluminal speeds @xcite ( 100 pc - scale ) .",
    "the presence of superluminal motions and the strong asymmetry of the jet brightness indicate that the jet flow is relativistic .",
    "the near - stationary components could be related to shocks or instabilities that can be either stationary or move more slowly than the bulk flow .",
    "currently , there are about 25 extragalactic objects   all belonging to the class of agn   that have been established as vhe @xmath1-ray emitters by ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , such as h.e.s.s . ,",
    "magic and veritas .",
    "so far , all of them except the radio galaxies m87 , centaurus a @xcite , and possibly 3c  66b @xcite belong to the class of blazars ( exhibiting a plasma jet pointing closely to our line of sight ) .",
    "a first indication of vhe @xmath1-ray emission ( @xmath10 ) from the direction of m87 in 1998/99 was reported by hegra @xcite .",

    "recently , the short - term variability in m87 was confirmed by magic in a strong vhe @xmath1-ray outburst @xcite .",

    "the measured flux variability rules out large - scale emission from dark matter annihilation @xcite , or cosmic - ray interactions @xcite .",
    "leptonic @xcite and hadronic @xcite jet emission models have been proposed to explain the tev emission .",
    "the location of the vhe @xmath1-ray emission is still unknown , but the nucleus @xcite , the inner jet @xcite or larger structures in the jet @xcite have been proposed as possible sites .",
    "the 2005 vhe @xmath1-ray flare ( h.e.s.s . ) was detected during an exceptional , several years lasting x - ray outburst of the innermost knot in the jet hst-1 @xcite , whereas the recent vhe @xmath1-ray flaring activity ( reported here ) occurred during an x - ray low state of hst-1 ( see fig .",

    "@xcite , magic @xcite and veritas @xcite result in : ( 1 ) an extended energy range by combining data sets taken under different zenith angles ; ( 2 ) an extended visibility during one night , because the visibility of any given celestial object depends on the longitude of the experimental site ; ( 3 ) an improved overall exposure and homogeneous coverage of the source ; ( 4 ) alerts and direct follow - up observations in case of high flux states .         among other agn ,",

    "magic and veritas . in order to achieve a best possible vhe coverage ( especially during chandra x - ray observations ) a closer cooperation was conducted for the 2008 observations of m87 : the collaborations agreed to have a detailed exchange / synchronization of their m87 observation schedules .",
    "further on , information about the status of the observations ( i.e. loss of observation time due to bad weather conditions , etc . )",
    "was exchanged on a regular basis between the shift crews and the observation coordinators .",
    "m87 was observed by the three experiments for a total of @xmath18 in 2008 ( @xmath1595  h after quality selection ) .",
    "the amount of data resulted in an unprecedentedly good coverage with @xmath250 nights between january and may 2008 .",
    "chandra monitoring of m87 began in 2002 and continues to date .",
    "the angular resolution ( @xmath00.8@xmath19 ) allows resolving the large - scale jet structure , and in particular to distinguish emission from the core and the innermost knot ` hst-1 ' ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] ) . during an observing season , m87",
    "is observed every @xmath156  weeks . that sampling allows detection of 1.5month - scale variability .",
    "the most remarkable discovery of the monitoring campaign so far has been the giant flare of hst-1 @xcite , which reached its maximum intensity in 2005 ( fig .",
    "1 ) when the tev emission was detected in flaring state for the first time , suggesting hst-1 as the possible origin of the vhe emission @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , a huge optical flare was detected by the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "additional observations were taken in 2007 on shorter intervals to investigate short - time variability and possible correlation with vhe emission , which was unfortunately in a quiet state at that time .     per beam followed by the rest ( black ) at intervals of @xmath20 per beam ; negative contours are indicated by dashed lines .",
    "the sequence shows the significant rise in the core flux density and the appearance of enhanced emission along the inner jet .",
    "[ fig : radio],scaledwidth=49.0% ]      throughout 2007 , m87 was observed at 43ghz with the vlba on a regular basis roughly every three weeks @xcite . in january 2008",
    ", the campaign was intensified to one observation every 5 days .",
    "the resolution of the observations is rather high with 0.21@xmath210.43 milliarcseconds or 30@xmath2160 schwarzschild diameter of m87 .",
    "the aim of this ` movie project ' was to study morphological changes of the plasma jet with time .",
    "preliminary analysis of the first 7 months showed a fast evolving structure , somewhat reminiscent of a smoke plume , with apparent velocities of about twice the speed of light .",
    "these motions were faster than expected so the movie project was extended from january to april 2008 with a sampling interval of 5 days .      in january 2008 , the vhe @xmath1-ray flux was measured at a slightly higher level than in 2007 .",
    "magic detected a strong flaring activity in february 2008 @xcite , which led to immediate intensified observations by all three vhe experiments .",
    "veritas detected another flare about one week after the magic trigger .",
    "the joint 2008 vhe @xmath1-ray light curve clearly confirms the short - term variability reported by h.e.s.s . in 2005",
    "@xcite . during the 2008 vhe flaring activity , magic observed flux variability above @xmath22 on time scales as short as 1  day ( at a significance level of @xmath23  standard deviations ) . at lower energies ( @xmath24 to @xmath22 )",
    "the emission was found to be compatible with a constant level @xcite . from march to may , m87 was back in a quiet state .    in 2008 ,",
    "the x - ray and vhe @xmath1-ray data suggested a different picture compared to the 2005 flare ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_all ] ) : hst-1 was in a low state , with the flux being comparable with the x - ray flux from the core . the core , however , showed an increased x - ray flux state in february 2008 , reaching a highest flux ever measured with chandra just few days after the vhe flaring activity .",
    "vlba measured a continuously increasing radio flux from the region of the nucleus ( @xmath25=1.2 mas ) during the 2008 campaign , whereas in 2007 the flux was found to be rather stable .",
    "individual snapshots of the inner region of the jet are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] . the observed radio flux densities reached at the end of the 2008 observations , roughly 2 months after the vhe flare occurred , are larger than seen in any previous vlbi observations of m87 at this frequency , including during the preceding 12 months of intensive monitoring , in 6 observations in 2006 and in individual observations in 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , and 2004 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that radio flares of the observed magnitude are uncommon . the correlation study and the implication of the 2008 results on the vhe emission models",
    "are presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "the cooperation between h.e.s.s . , magic and veritas in 2008 allowed for an optimized observation strategy , which resulted in the detection and detailed measurement of a vhe @xmath1-ray outburst from m87 .",
    "simultaneous chandra observations , found hst-1 , the innermost knot in the jet , in a low state , while the nucleus showed increased x - ray activity .",
    "this is in contrast to the 2005 vhe @xmath1-ray flare , where hst-1 was in an extreme high state .",
    "the radio activity in 20072008 , resolving the inner region of m87 down to some 10s schwarzschild radii , allows for speculation about the origin of the vhe @xmath1-ray emission . a model suggesting hst-1 to be the origin of the @xmath1-ray emission seems less likely in the light of the 2008 result . due to its proximity and the viewing angle of the jet ,",
    "m87 is a unique laboratory for studying the connection between jet physics and the measured vhe @xmath1-ray emission . to finally unravel the location / mechanism of the vhe @xmath1-ray emission , future coordinated vhe observations ( such as the 2008 campaign ) are essential , together with simultaneous observations in the radio to x - ray ( chandra ) regimes .",
    "future joint observations could also lead to the detection of vhe @xmath1-ray intra - night variability , which would futher constrain the size of the emission region .",
