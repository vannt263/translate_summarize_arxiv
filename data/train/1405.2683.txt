    "in the late 1960s , vlastimil ptk ( 19251999 ) derived the _ method of nondiscrete induction_. this method for estimating the convergence of iterative processes was originally motivated by a quantitative refinement ptk had found for the closed graph theorem from functional analysis in 1966  @xcite .",
    "he published about 15 papers on the method , five of them jointly with potra in the 1980s , and the work on the method culminated with their 1984 joint monograph  @xcite . for historical remarks on the development of the method",
    "see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* preface ) or  @xcite .",
    "ptk described the general motivation for the method of nondiscrete induction in his paper `` what should be a rate of convergence ? '' , published in 1977  @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it seems therefore reasonable to look for another method of estimating the convergence of iterative processes , one which would satisfy the following requirements .",
    "* it should relate quantities which may be measured or estimated during the actual process .",
    "* it should describe accurately in particular the initial stage of the process , not only its asymptotic behaviour since , after all , we are interested in keeping the number of steps necessary to obtain a good estimate as low as possible . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this seems to be almost too much to ask for . yet , for some iterations the method of nondiscrete induction indeed leads to analytical convergence estimates which satisfy the above requirements .",
    "the essential idea , as we will describe in more detail below , is that in the method of nondiscrete induction the rate of convergence of an iterative process is considered _ a function rather than just a number_. ptk derived convergence results satisfying the above requirements for a handful of examples including newton s method  @xcite ( this work was refined in  @xcite ) , and an iteration for solving a certain eigenvalue problem  @xcite .",
    "for these examples it was shown that the convergence estimates resulting from the method of nondiscrete induction are indeed optimal in the sense that in certain cases they are attained in every step of the iteration .",
    "in addition to the original papers , comprehensive statements of such sharpness results are given in the book of potra and ptk ; see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  5.10 ) for newton s method and  ( * ? ? ? * proposition  7.5 ) for the eigenvalue iteration .",
    "despite these strong theoretical results , it appears that the method of nondiscrete induction never became widely known . even in the literature on newton methods for nonlinear problems",
    "it is often mentioned only marginally ( if at all ) ; see , e.g. , deuflhard s monograph  @xcite .",
    "part of the reason for this neglect of the method may be the lack of numerically computed examples in the original publications .",
    "the goals of this paper are : ( 1 ) to motivate and prove a theorem on nondiscrete induction due to potra and ptk that is directly applicable in the analysis of iterative processes , ( 2 ) to explain on two examples ( namely the newton iterations for the matrix polar decomposition and the matrix square root ) how the method of nondiscrete induction can be applied to matrix iterations in numerical linear algebra , and ( 3 ) to demonstrate the method s effectiveness as well as discuss some of its weaknesses in the numerical linear algebra context .",
    "it must be stressed upfront , that most theoretical results in sections  [ sec : polar ] and  [ sec : appl ] also could be derived using the general theory of newton s method for nonlinear operators in banach spaces as described in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters  2 and  5 ) and in the related papers of potra and ptk , in particular  @xcite .",
    "the strategy in this paper is , however , to apply the method of nondiscrete induction without any functional analytic framework and differentiability assumptions directly to the given algebraic matrix iterations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we describe the method of nondiscrete induction and derive the theorem of potra and ptk .",
    "we then apply this theorem in analysis the newton iterations for computing the matrix polar decomposition ( section  [ sec : polar ] ) and the matrix square root ( section  [ sec : appl ] ) . for both iterations",
    "we prove convergence results and illustrate them numerically . in section  [ sec : concl ]",
    "we give concluding remarks and an outlook to further work .",
    "in most of the publications on the method of nondiscrete induction , ptk formulated the method based on his `` induction theorem '' , which is an inclusion result for certain subsets of a metric space ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or the book of potra and ptk  ( * ? ? ? * proposition  1.7 ) . instead of the original induction theorem we will in this paper use a result that was stated and proven by potra and ptk as a `` particular case of the induction theorem '' in  ( * ? ? ? * proposition  1.9 ) ; also cf .  @xcite . unlike the induction theorem ,",
    "this result is formulated directly in terms of an iterative algorithm , and therefore it is easier to apply in our context . in order to fully explain the result and its consequences for the analysis of iterative algorithms we will below give a motivation of the required concepts as well as a complete proof of the assertion without referring to the induction theorem .",

    "consider a mapping @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the domain of definition of @xmath5 , i.e. , the subset of all @xmath6 for which @xmath7 is well defined .",
    "for each @xmath8 we may then consider the iterative algorithm @xmath9 with iterates given by @xmath10 if all iterates are well defined , i.e. , @xmath11 for all @xmath12 , then the iterative algorithm @xmath9 is called _",
    "it is clear from ( [ eqn : algorithm ] ) that a ( meaningful ) iterative algorithm can converge to some @xmath13 only when the distances between @xmath14 and @xmath15 decrease to zero for @xmath16 .",
    "this requirement , and the rate by which the convergence to zero occurs , are formalized in the method of nondiscrete induction by means of a ( nondiscrete ) family of subsets @xmath17 that depend on a positive real parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the key idea is that for each @xmath19 , where possibly @xmath20 , the set @xmath21 should contain all elements @xmath22 for which the distance between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is at most @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath25 , and then to analyze what happens with the elements of @xmath21 under one application of the mapping @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the method compares the values @xmath26 hopefully , the new distance @xmath27 is ( much ) smaller than the previous distance @xmath28 . using the family of sets this can formally be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 should be a ( positive ) `` small function '' of @xmath18 that needs to be determined .",
    "this function is called the _ rate of convergence _ of the iterative algorithm . since in the limit",
    "the distances between the iterates should approach zero , the limiting point(s ) @xmath31 of the algorithm are contained in the limit set @xmath32 , which is not to be constructed explicitly but is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the closure of the set @xmath35 .",

    "e.g. , in  @xcite , such classical bounds compare quantities that are not available at any finite step of the process , simply because @xmath31 is unknown .",
