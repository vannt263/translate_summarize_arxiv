    "in this paper we are concerned with the statistical mechanics of surfaces . a possible approach in space dimensions @xmath6 is to discretize the surface using a triangulation [ 1 - 4 ] . for this",
    "we need to specify the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "the surface @xmath8 is replaced by a simplical triangulation @xmath9 , specified by the number of nodes @xmath10 , of links and triangles , and the @xmath11-coordinate field by the coordinates @xmath11 of the nodes .",
    "the metrical fluctuations of the manifold are modeled by summing over triangulations induced by link - flips [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian is now choosen , such that the partition function is not dominated by configurations with spikes . in order to surpress these",
    "spikes one adds a term with extrinsic curvature . as a function of the extrinsic curvature the model shows a transition ( crumpling transition ) at finite rigidity of the surface [ 8 - 18 ] . in a previous paper , we discussed the extrinsic and intrinsic geometrical properties of dynamically triangulated random surfaces ( for example the hausdorff - dimension , spectral and spreading dimension ) above , below and at the transition @xcite .    the partition function of the above model can be written as    @xmath12    where the translational mode is integrated out .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 is defined as    @xmath13    the gaussian part of the hamiltonian @xmath14 is a sum over the positions @xmath11 in embedding euclidian space of all nearest neighbours nodes , i.e. all links of the triangulation .",
    "we shall use @xmath15 because of the rescaling invariance .",
    "@xmath16 is an edge extrinsic curvature term [ 19 - 26 ] .",
    "@xmath17 denotes a summation over all adjacent triangles which share an edge and @xmath18 is the scalar product of the vectors normal to a triangle .",
    "the third part of the hamiltonian @xmath19 is the discretization of the square root of the metric .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the number of nearest neighbours of node @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 depends on the measure .",
    "we used @xmath23 for the simulations in @xmath24 dimensional embedding space .    here",
    "we investigate such a model numerically ( monte carlo simulations ) , applying finite - size scaling ideas .",
    "these ideas have proven successful in other contexts for the analysis of phase transitions .",
    "we expect that the above model shows a phase transition at some critical value of the coupling @xmath25 .",
    "there are several questions which we want to address : what is the order of the transition ? if the transition is of second order , what are the exponents ?",
    "are the exponents topology dependent ?",
    "is the transition temperature topology dependent ?",
    "first let us study the effect of the extrinsic curvature on the auto - correlation time of several observables , i.e. , we are interested in the dynamics of a random surface induced by a monte carlo process .",
    "such a study is of course a prerequisite for a detailed numerical study of the apparent transition which such surfaces undergo as a function of a bending rigidity . from our results which we present below we must conclude that extensive computer resources must be applied because of the very long relaxation times which even for moderate surface sizes can reach several tenthousand sweeps .",
    "we want to look at the closed dynamically triangulated random surfaces without self - avoidance . as models for such surfaces",
    "we take the first two topologically closed surfaces : the sphere and the torus ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : show ] ) .",
    "the torus is specified by identifying edges of the parameter space @xmath26 whereas the sphere , because of its genus needs a slightly more complicated set - up procedure .",
    "what we are interested in is to calculate the auto - correlation function of an observable @xmath27 as a function of time @xmath28 and its dependence on the number of nodes @xmath10 of the surface . from the auto - correlation function",
    "we are then able to extract the auto - correlation time @xmath29 .",
    "this is done calculating the integrated auto - correlation function , i.e. , @xmath30 we also compared the integrated auto - correlation time with the exponential correlation time and the statistical inefficiency , but found no disagreement within the errors . if the successively generated configurations can be considered as non - interacting beads as is done in the rouse theory @xcite we will find for example for the radius of gyration @xmath31 and in general we expect @xmath32    to calculate observables such as the gaussian part @xmath14 of the hamiltonian or the radius of gyration @xmath33 , we use the standard monte carlo algorithm [ 29 - 31 ] .",
    "such an algorithm induces a stochastic dynamics and all our results apply only to such an induced dynamics .",
    "one monte carlo sweep is completed when each triangulation point was given the chance for a displacement from its previous position and the edges of the triangulation were given the chance to re - connected or flip to an orthogonal position ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc ] .",
    "the flip operation implements the sum over all possible triangulation ) .",
    "this corresponds to one new configuration .",
    "table  [ tab_sph ] summarizes our results for the exponent @xmath34 for the sphere .",
    "the exponents where extracted from the data of system sizes from @xmath35 up to @xmath36 . at this point",
    "we should mention that the expected transition is at @xmath37 .",
    "out data was collected above and below the transition .    above and below the transition",
    "the radius of gyration shows the rouse behaviour .",
    "the gaussian part of the hamiltonian shows clearly a dependence on the bending rigidity . above the transition point",
    "the auto - correlation exponent changes to one and below it is almost zero .",
    "the same holds for the edge part of the hamiltonian .     &",

    "finite size scaling assumes , that there is only one relevant linear length scale , which is compared to the correlation length . to apply finite size scaling to the crumpling transition of dynamically triangulated random surfaces ( dtrs ) one must therefore assume a single length scale determined by the number of nodes @xmath10 and the internal dimension @xmath50 of the surface                    the first part is related to the gaussian hamiltonian @xmath14 and the second to the specific heat @xmath59 of the edge extrinsic curvature @xmath16 . the specific heat for the edge extrinsic curvature is shown in figure  [ fig : ceall ] for the two topologies considered .",
    "the interpolation was done by the method of ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite using histograms of @xmath16 .    using the data of the specfic heat obtained by applying the extrapolation method",
    ", we can get a very accurate estimate of the positions of the maxima and of the heights .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmax_scale ] shows @xmath55 of the torus and the sphere .",
    "a change to @xmath56 behaviour is very unlikely and for that reason the data strongly suggest a continuous phase transition in agreement with previous work [ 8,14 - 17,38,39 ] . from the data shown in figure  [ fig : cmax_scale ]",
    "we can obtain the following upper boundaries of critical exponents      using this simple method , we can not distinguish a diverging specific heat with very small but positiv @xmath22 , a logarithmic divergence @xmath62 and a power law cusp @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the exponent of the singular part of the specific heat .",
    "we will use the abbreviation @xmath22 instead of @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ce_fit_alpha ] shows such fits for @xmath66 ( power law ) , @xmath67 ( near logarithmic ) and @xmath68 ( power law cusp ) .",
    "the fits clearly favour a power law cusp of the specific heat with a large negative value of @xmath22 , although we were not able to estimate the exponent @xmath22 precisely .",
    "our results are in contrast to the estimates of renken and kogut @xcite @xmath69 for the sphere .",
    "they assumed scaling above @xmath70 , but the more accurate data in figure  [ fig : cmax_scale ] shows that this assumption is not true .",
    "the decreasing slope in figure  [ fig : cmax_scale ] is also present in their figure 5 @xcite although this is slightly masked by larger error barrs and less data points .",
    "catteral et all .",
    "@xcite reported an estimate of @xmath71 , but they used a different discretization based on @xmath72 graphs with a flip acceptance rate of only o(1% ) at @xmath73 and larger correlation times of the edge extrinsic curvature than in our discretization .",
    "we computed @xmath74 defined by equation  ( [ equ : vl_def ] ) using again the method of ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite .",
    "the resulting figures show the predicted single peak minima with wings following equation  ( [ equ : vl_tneqtc ] ) .",
    "the finite size dependence of the minima of @xmath81 shown in figure  [ fig : vl_min ] distinctly favours the asymptotic behaviour in equation  ( [ equ : vl_teqtc2 ] ) and therefore a continuous phase transition or a very weak first order transition .    in general , finite",
    "size scaling predicts also a shift @xmath82 of the effective transition ` temperature ' @xmath83 proportional to @xmath84 for a first- and proportional to @xmath85 for a second - order transition .",
    "unfortunatly @xmath86 of dynamically triangulated random surfaces is not known .",
    "for that reason , we have to use a two - parameter fit with unknowns @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "but we can improve the reliability of this fit , because we know more .",
    "first , the fit has to be a straight line ( neglecting corrections to scaling ) and we have @xmath88 .",
    "second , the shift @xmath89 is different for the specific heat and the cumulant in general .",
    "therefore the slope of the fitted lines will be different in general , but we still have @xmath88 for both observables .",
    "we turn now to the order parameter itself .",
    "common practise is to take @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the typical radius , @xmath94 the linear size of the membrane ) to be a suitable order parameter [ 41 - 47 ] . initially @xcite it was also defined as @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , with the linear size @xmath94 of the hexagon and the radius of gyration @xmath97 .",
    "a suitable choice for the order parameter therefore is @xmath98              we also measured another possible order paramter @xmath102 , @xmath103 which exhibits a small increase near the phase transition and a slower decay of @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "the difference is caused by a change of the internal geometry near the phase transition @xcite .    with the data for the sphere in figure  [ fig : s_zeta ] and the corresponding data of the torus one can estimate the critical exponent @xmath106 of the order parameter assuming a second order transition .",
    "here we use as the effective critical temperature the position of the peak of the specific heat .",
