    "the pulsar s @xmath5 and spin - down rate @xmath6 imply a characteristic age @xmath7  kyr , making this object one of the youngest pulsars in the galaxy , consistent with an association with the supernova remnant g292.2@xmath10.5 @xcite at a distance of 8.4kpc @xcite . those same spin parameters , under the assumption of vacuum dipole spin - down , imply a dipolar surface magnetic field @xmath8  g , among the highest known among radio pulsars .",
    "the pulsar s spin - down luminosity is @xmath9  erg  s@xmath10 .    past x - ray observations of the source @xcite",

    "this emission was well described by a two - component model consisting of a power law of index @xmath112.1 , with a hot thermal component of blackbody temperature @xmath12  kev , high compared to lower - field radio pulsars of comparable age ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we present a phase - coherent ephemeris in table  [ tab : timing ] and the timing residuals in the left panel of figure  [ fig : resplot ] .    to determine an ephemeris for the post - outburst _ swift _ and _ nustar _ observations , we folded the soft x - ray photons ( @xmath18kev ) from each observation , starting with the ephemeris from the lat observations and extracted toas from each orbit using the ml method .",
    "as there is no apparent evolution in the pulse profiles over the @xmath19kev energy band , the offset between toas from both telescopes should be minimal .",
    "we then used the tempo2 timing software package @xcite to fit the toas .",
    "it is apparent that the lat ephemeris did not accurately describe the post - outburst toas and requires a change in the spin frequency . due to the long integration times required to extract a toa from lat ,",

    "next we compare this object s 2006 outburst with the event studied here .",

    "nustar _ observation was @xmath83  erg  s@xmath10  cm@xmath24 . for a distance of 8.4  kpc , and assuming isotropic emission , this implies a luminosity of @xmath85  erg  s@xmath10 , or 0.1@xmath86 .",
    "this represents an increase over the quiescent value in this band of a factor of over @xmath87 . including the flux from 10  kev extrapolated to the top of the _ nustar _ band increases this value by @xmath1120% .",
    "the efficiency for conversion of @xmath86 to _ fermi_-band @xmath0-ray emission , at least in quiescence , was estimated by @xcite to be 0.23 . with a comparable amount of energy suddenly appearing in x - rays ,",
    "the _ fermi_-band emission may have been affected during this outburst",
    ". however , the normally low _ fermi_/lat count rate ( see  [ sec : timing ] ) requires multiple weeks of integration for a detection , hence a short - term anomaly may be undetectable .",
    "by contrast , for psr j1846@xmath10258 , in _",
    "observations made within one week of its first detected magnetar - like burst , the unabsorbed flux in the 0.510-kev band was @xmath88  erg  s@xmath10  cm@xmath24 @xcite . for isotropic emission and a distance of 6  kpc @xcite , this implies a luminosity of @xmath89  erg  s@xmath10 , or 0.02@xmath86 .",
    "this represented an increase of a factor of @xmath90 over the quiescent value .",
    "as this outburst had no realtime trigger , it is possible that initially the pulsar brightened more .",
    "however the pulsed flux measured by _ rxte _ at the initial burst epoch was comparable a week later .",
    "hence the increase in flux was probably not much larger than a factor of @xmath1110 , never exceeding a few percent of @xmath86 .",
    "thus energetically , the psr j1119@xmath16127 outburst is far larger than that in psr j1846@xmath10258 .    the spectral evolution in the two events also differed . in quiescence ,",
    "psr j1846@xmath10258 s x - ray spectrum is well described by a simple power law of index 1.1(1 ) @xcite , very different from the soft quiescent spectrum psr j1119@xmath16127 .",
    "the latter , well described by a blackbody of @xmath91  kev and power law of index 2.1(8 ) @xcite , made this pulsar the youngest with detected thermal emission .",
    "it was also one of the hottest and most luminous thermal emitters even among rotation - powered pulsars of similar age @xcite .",
    "this emission was also noted to be unusual for its high pulsed fraction @xcite .    during outburst ,",
    "psr  j1846@xmath10258 developed a bright soft component , whereas the harder power - law spectrum remained unchanged , apart from an increase in normalization by @xmath1135% above 10  kev @xcite .",
    "the soft component was described as having a power - law spectrum of index 1.9(1 ) @xcite . by contrast , the spectrum of psr j1119@xmath16127 has undergone a radical hardening , with @xmath92 increasing from 0.21(4)kev to 1.10(6)kev . nevertheless , the net effect in both outbursts was a transition to a spectrum very similar to those of bright magnetars .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the outburst timing anomalies . in psr j1846@xmath10258 , it suffered a sudden spin - up having @xmath93 , followed by a large increase in @xmath94 yielding a strong over - recovery of the glitch @xcite .",
    "the net long - term effect was a spin-_down _ , accompanied by a change in braking index and a long - term enhancement in timing noise .",
    "while it is too early to know the post - outburst timing evolution in psr  j1119@xmath16127 , from our timing analysis , we find that the pulsar had a similar - sized spin - up glitch with @xmath95 .",
    "presently any increase in spin - down rate is modest compared to some glitch recoveries in magnetars and certainly compared to that following the 2006 psr j1846@xmath10258 glitch .",
    "however , greater evolution may yet be detected .    in young radio pulsars like psr j1119@xmath16127 , hard x - ray emission",
    "is thought to arise in the context of outer gap models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from synchrotron radiation from secondary electron / positron pairs produced by inward propagating curvature radiation @xmath0-rays .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , in psr j1119@xmath16127 , the x - ray/@xmath0-ray phase offset , together with the single - peak morphology of the @xmath0-ray pulse , are well explained in outer gap models .",
    "the luminosity of both the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission in this picture must be bounded by the spin - down power .",
    "the increase in x - ray luminosity particularly in the hard x - ray range during the outburst of psr j1846@xmath10258 was argued by @xcite to be plausibly due to the above - described rotation - powered outer - gap emission , enhanced by particle injection due to perhaps to crust cracking that occurred at the glitch , reasonable given the lack of evidence for the hard x - ray luminosity exceeding more than a few percent of @xmath86 .",
    "the new hard x - ray emission component in psr j1119@xmath16127 could have an outer - gap origin as well , but the large luminosity rise to within 0.1@xmath86 in the x - ray band alone may be difficult to accommodate in such a picture , and might require a commensurate increase in @xmath0-ray luminosity , impossible given the available @xmath86 energy budget .    alternatively , the hard x - ray emission may be magnetar - like .",
    "the origin of the bright hard x - ray component in magnetars has been argued to be a decelerating electron / positron flow in the closed magnetosphere , in the higher altitude regions of large magnetic loops @xcite .",
    "this emission is powered ultimately by the internal stellar magnetic field and is not limited by @xmath86 . in this interpretation ,",
    "the pulsar suffered an instability such that a significant twist in its field lines occurred , with highly relativistic particles ( @xmath96 ) injected near the star where @xmath97  g. if this is origin of the hard x - rays in psr j1119@xmath16127 , then the true internal field of this pulsar is far higher than is inferred from its dipole component .",
    "this would support the argument for additional non - dipolar field components in apparently low - magnetic - field magnetars @xcite .",
    "one way to test this explanation is through modelling of the phase - resolved hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "this can yield constraints on the geometry of the emission region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such constraints could then be compared with similar ones from radio polarimetry @xcite and/or modelling of the @xmath0-ray light curve @xcite .",
    "importantly , psrs  j1846@xmath10258 and now j1119@xmath16127 are the only two rotation - powered pulsars to have exhibited radiative changes at glitch epochs ; this must be a consequence of their high spin - inferred @xmath98 .",
    "indeed no x - ray enhancement was seen in _",
    "observations made 3.5 days following a large ( @xmath99 ) spin - up glitch in the lower - field ( @xmath100  g ) vela radio pulsar @xcite . on the other hand , there was no evidence for an x - ray enhancement in psr j1846@xmath10258 near the epoch of a much smaller glitch having @xmath101 @xcite , nor in previous glitches ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 in 2004 and 2007 , respectively ) in psr j1119@xmath16127 @xcite , although prompt x - ray observations were not performed in those cases",
    ". moreover , multiple sizeable glitches in _ bona fide _ magnetars have been unaccompanied by radiative changes @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that an independent parameter such as the crustal depth of the glitch location plays a role in the radiative detectability of high - b neutron - stars at glitch epochs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility of a magnetar - like outburst from a high - b radio pulsar was discussed by @xcite , who also suggested the possibility of radio emission from magnetars prior to its discovery by @xcite .",
