    "the quasi - optical macroscopic quantum phenomenon of birefringence , first described in @xcite , combines the effects of particle spin rotation ( oscillation ) and spin dichroism ( i.e. , the dependence of the absorption coefficient on the particle spin state ) and occurs when high - energy particles with spin @xmath0 traverse matter .",
    "it is analogous to the phenomenon known in optics as birefringence of light in optically anisotropic media due to the dependence of the refractive index on the polarization state of light , i.e. , on the photon spin state .",
    "in contrast to light , whose wavelength largely exceeds the interatomic distance in matter , the de broglie wavelength for a fast particle is much shorter than this distance . according to @xcite , however , in this case one can also introduce for particles a spin - dependent index of refraction . under such conditions ,",
    "the birefringence effect for deuterons takes place even in homogeneous , isotropic matter and results from the intrinsic anisotropy of particles with spin @xmath0 .",
    "an important implication of the spin dichroism effect is tensor polarization arising in the initially unpolarized beam after it has passed through an unpolarized target @xcite .    in 2005 ,",
    "the spin dichroism effect was first experimentally observed for 520 mev deuterons passing through a carbon target @xcite . in 2007 , tensor polarization arising in a nuclotron extracted beam of initially unpolarized deuterons with a momentum of 5gev / c was measured @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of spin dichroism and tensor polarization of the transmitted deuterons are proportional to the difference between the total interaction cross sections of the particle with the nucleus for the states with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .    according to @xcite",
    ", this effect can be used not only for studying the total spin  dependent interaction cross section , but also for obtaining tensor - polarized deuteron beams .",
    "besides , this effect must be taken into account when interpreting the results of planned experiments @xcite for measuring the electric dipole moment of deuterons @xcite .    in theoretical description of this phenomenon , one should bear in mind that a deuteron colliding with a nucleus undergoes two interactions : the coulomb and nuclear ones .",
    "the coulomb interaction not only causes multiple coulomb scattering , but in some cases , it can also affect significantly the magnitude of tensor polarization of the deuterons that have passed through the target . it has been shown in @xcite , for example , that the coulomb  nuclear interference gives a clue to the explanation of the experimentally observed fact that tensor polarization reverses sign as the energy of deuterons changes from 5 to 20mev",

    ", it is shown that tensor polarization of the deuterons escaping from the target in the direction of the in - coming primary beam depends on the collimator s angular width of the detector that registers the transmitted deuteron beam .",
